# Description
Each ```test``` and ```train``` foler contains resp. ```1000``` and ```5000``` abstracts  of articles for each math category in https://arxiv.org/. The name of each txt file is the id for the corresponding arxiv article. The data is fetched via the public api offered by arxiv. 

I collect these data for learning neural networks.
