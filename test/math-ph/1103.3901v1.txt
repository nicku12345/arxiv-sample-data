In this short review paper, we discuss the concept of time delay for an abstract quantum scattering system. Its definition in terms of sojourn times is explained as well as its identity with the so-called Eisenbud-Wigner time delay. Necessary and natural conditions for such a construction are introduced and thoroughly discussed. Assumptions and statements are precisely formulated but proofs are contained in two companion papers written in collaboration with R. Tiedra de Aldecoa.
