A univariate polynomial equation is presented. It provides models of the thermal lattice Boltzmann equation. The models can be accurate up to any required level and can be applied to regular lattices, which allow efficient and accurate approximate solutions of the Boltzmann equation. We derive models satisfying the complete Galilean invariant and providing accuracy of the 4th-order moment and beyond. We simulate thermal shock tube problems to illustrate the accuracy of our models and to show the remarkably enhanced stability obtained by our models and our discretized equilibrium distributions.
