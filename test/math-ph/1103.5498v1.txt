We consider an ergodic Schr\"odinger operator with magnetic field within the non-interacting particle approximation. Justifying the linear response theory, a rigorous derivation of a Kubo formula for the electric conductivity tensor within this context can be found in a recent work of Bouclet, Germinet, Klein and Schenker. If the Fermi level falls into a region of localization, the well-known Kubo-Streda formula for the quantum Hall conductivity at zero temperature is recovered. In this review we go along the lines of but make a more systematic use of noncommutative Lp-spaces, leading to a somewhat more transparent proof.
