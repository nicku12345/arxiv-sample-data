The classification of real Clifford algebras in terms of matrix algebras is well--known. Here we consider the real Clifford algebra {\mathcal Cl}(r,s) not as a matrix algebra, but as a Clifford module over itself. We show that {\mathcal Cl}(r,s) possesses a basis independent complex structure only when the square of the volume element \omega is -1, in which case it is uniquely given up to sign by right multiplication with \omega.
