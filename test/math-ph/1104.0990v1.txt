The Pauli-Fierz model H(\alpha) in nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics is considered. The external potential V is sufficiently shallow and the dipole approximation is assumed. It is proven that there exist constants 0<\alpha_-< \alpha_+ such that H(\alpha) has no ground state for |\alpha|<\alpha_-, which complements an earlier result stating that there is a ground state for |\alpha| > \alpha_+. We develop a suitable extension of the Birman-Schwinger argument. Moreover for any given \delta>0 examples of potentials V are provided such that \alpha_+-\alpha_-<\delta.
