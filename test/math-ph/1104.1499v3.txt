We derive a new asymptotic formula for the Wigner 9j-symbol, in the limit of one small and eight large angular momenta, using a novel gauge-invariant factorization for the asymptotic solution of a set of coupled wave equations. Our factorization eliminates the geometric phases completely, using gauge-invariant non-canonical coordinates, parallel transports of spinors, and quantum rotation matrices. Our derivation generalizes to higher 3nj-symbols. We display without proof some new asymptotic formulas for the 12j-symbol and the 15j-symbol in the appendices. This work contributes a new asymptotic formula of the Wigner 9j-symbol to the quantum theory of angular momentum, and serves as an example of a new general method for deriving asymptotic formulas for 3nj-symbols.
