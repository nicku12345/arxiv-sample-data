We present new asymptotic formulas for the Wigner 15j-symbol with two, three, or four small quantum numbers, and provide numerical evidence of their validity. These formulas are of the WKB form and are of a similar nature as the Ponzano-Regge formula for the Wigner 6j-symbol. They are expressed in terms of edge lengths and angles of geometrical figures associated with angular momentum vectors. In particular, the formulas for the 15j-symbol with two, three, and four small quantum numbers are based on the geometric figures of the 9j-, 6j-, and 3j-symbols, respectively, The geometric nature of these new asymptotic formulas pave the way for further analysis of the semiclassical limits of vertex amplitudes in loop quantum gravity models.
