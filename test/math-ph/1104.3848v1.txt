One-dimensional Yang-Mills-Nahm models are considered from algebrogeometric points of view. A quasiclassical quantization of the models based on path integral and its zeta function representation in terms of a Green function diagonal for a heat equation with an elliptic potential is considered. The Green function diagonal and, hence, zeta function and its derivative are expressed via solutions of Hermit equation and, alternatively, by means of Its-Matveev formalism in terms of Riemann teta-functions.   For the Nahm model, which field is represented via elliptic (lemniscate) integral by construction, one-loop quantum corrections to action are evaluated as the zeta function derivative in zero point in terms of a hyperelliptic integral. The alternative expression should help to link the representations and continue investigation of the Yang-Mills-Nahm models.   Keywords: Nahm model, one-loop quantum corrections, zeta function, elliptic potential, hyperelliptic integral, Its-Matveev formula. MSC numbers: 81Q30, 35J10, 35K08, 81T13.
