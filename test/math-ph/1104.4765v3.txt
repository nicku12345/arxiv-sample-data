We give necessary and sufficient conditions for real sequences to be the spectra of selfadjoint extensions of an entire operator whose domain may be non-dense. For this spectral characterization we use de Branges space techniques and a generalization of Krein's functional model for simple, regular, closed, symmetric operators with deficiency indices (1,1). This is an extension of our previous work in which similar results were obtained for densely defined operators.
