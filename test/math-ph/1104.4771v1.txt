The self-adjoint sub-classes of nonlinear evolution equations of fourth-order with time dependent coefficients are determined, generalizing some recent results. Using the new conservation theorem recently proved by Nail Ibragimov some conservation laws for time dependent equations are established illustrating the main results.
