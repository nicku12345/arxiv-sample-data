We derive the leading asymptotic limit of the Wigner 3j-symbol from a stationary phase approximation of a twelve dimensional integral, obtained from an inner product between two exact Bargmann wavefunctions. We show that, by the construction of the Bargmann inner product, the stationary phase conditions have a geometric description in terms of the Hopf fibration of {\mathbb C}^6 into {\mathbb R}^3 \times {\mathbb R}^3 \times {\mathbb R}^3. In addition, we find that, except for the usual modification of the quantum numbers by 1/2, the imaginary part of the logarithm of a Bargmann wavefunction, evaluated at the stationary points, is equal to the asymptotic phase of the 3j-symbol.
