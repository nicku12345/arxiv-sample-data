We construct the time evolution for states of Glauber dynamics for a spatial infinite particle system in terms of generating functionals. This is carried out by an Ovsjannikov-type result in a scale of Banach spaces, leading to a local (in time) solution which, under certain initial conditions, might be extended to a global one. An application of this approach to Vlasov-type scaling in terms of generating functionals is considered as well.
