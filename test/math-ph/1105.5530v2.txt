The paper Brauchart, Hardin and Saff [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 41(4) (2009)] gives the complete asymptotic expansions of the Riesz s-energy of the Nth roots of unity which form a universally optimal distribution of points on the unit circle in the sense of Cohn and Kumar [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 20 (2007)]. Here, exact formulas (valid for all N \geq 2) are obtained for the case when s is an even integer. In the case of the singular Riesz s-potential 1/r^s, r the Euclidean distance between two points, a continuous modified energy approximation of the Riesz energy is used. Stirling numbers of the first kind, Eulerian numbers and special values of partial Bell polynomials play a central role. Several identities between these quantities are shown.
