We introduce a new version of discrete holomorphic observables for the critical planar Ising model. These observables are holomorphic spinors defined on double covers of the original multiply connected domain. We compute their scaling limits, and show their relation to the ratios of spin correlations, thus providing a rigorous proof to a number of formulae for those ratios predicted by CFT arguments.
