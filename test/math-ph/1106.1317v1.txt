A procedure to construct K-matrices from the generalized q-Onsager algebra \cO_{q}(\hat{g}) is proposed. This procedure extends the intertwiner techniques used to obtain scalar (c-number) solutions of the reflection equation to dynamical (non-c-number) solutions. It shows the relation between soliton non-preserving reflection equations or twisted reflection equations and the generalized q-Onsager algebras. These dynamical K-matrices are important to quantum integrable models with extra degrees of freedom located at the boundaries: for instance, in the quantum affine Toda field theories on the half-line they yield the boundary amplitudes. As examples, the cases of \cO_{q}(a^{(2)}_{2}) and \cO_{q}(a^{(1)}_{2}) are treated in details.
