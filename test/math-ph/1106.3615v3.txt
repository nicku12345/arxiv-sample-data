Local fractional calculus deals with everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable functions in fractal space. The Yang-Fourier transform based on the local fractional calculus is a generalization of Fourier transform in fractal space. In this paper, local fractional continuous non-differentiable functions in fractal space are studied, and the generalized model for the Yang-Fourier transforms derived from the local fractional calculus are introduced. A generalized model for the Yang-Fourier transforms in fractal space and some results are proposed in detail.
