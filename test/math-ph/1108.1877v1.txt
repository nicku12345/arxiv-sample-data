The paper is devoted to the group analysis of equations of motion of two-dimensional uniformly stratified rotating fluids used as a basic model in geophysical fluid dynamics. It is shown that the nonlinear equations in question have a remarkable property to be self-adjoint.   This property is crucial for constructing conservation laws provided in the present paper. Invariant solutions are constructed using certain symmetries. The invariant solutions are used for defining internal wave beams.
