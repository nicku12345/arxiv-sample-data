We consider the dipole-dipole correlations for the two-dimensional Coulomb gas/sine-Gordon model for \beta> 8\pi by a renormalization group method. First we re-establish the renormalization group analysis for the partition function using finite range decomposition of the covariance. Then we extend the analysis to the correlation functions. Finally, we show a power-law decay characteristic of the dipole gas.
