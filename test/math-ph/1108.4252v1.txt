Bound and scattering state solutions of the effective-mass Klein-Gordon equation are obtained for the Yukawa potential with any angular momentum \ell. Energy eigenvalues, normalized wave functions and scattering phase shifts are calculated as well as for the constant mass case. Bound state solutions of the Coulomb potential are also studied as a limiting case. Analytical and numerical results are compared with the ones obtained before.
