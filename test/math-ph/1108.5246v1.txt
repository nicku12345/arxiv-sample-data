We exploit SU(N) Schwinger bosons to construct and analyze the coupled irreducible representations of SU(N) \times SU(N) in terms of the invariant group. The corresponding projection operators are constructed in terms of the invariant group generators. We also construct SU(N) \times SU(N) irreducible Schwinger bosons which directly create these coupled irreducible states. The SU(N) Clebsch Gordan coefficients are computed as the matrix elements of the projection operators.
