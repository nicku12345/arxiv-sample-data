In our paper we consider the notion of determinant of Clifford algebra elements. We present some new formulas for determinant of Clifford algebra elements for the cases of dimension 4 and 5. Also we consider the notion of trace of Clifford algebra elements. We use the generalization of the Pauli's theorem for 2 sets of elements that satisfy the main anticommutation conditions of Clifford algebra.
