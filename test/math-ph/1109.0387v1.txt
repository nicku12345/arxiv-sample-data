Three possible techniques to deal with a vector particle in the anti de Sitter cosmological model are viewed: Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau matrix formalism based on the general tetrad recipe, group theory 5-dimensional approach based on the symmetry group SO(3.2), anda tetrad form of Maxwell equations in complex Riemann-Silberstein-Majorana-Oppenheimer representation. In the first part, a spin 1 massive field is considered in static coordinates of the anti de Sitter space-time in tetrad-based approach. The complete set of spherical wave solutions with quantum numbers (\epsilon, j,m,l) is constructed; angular dependence in wave functions is described with the help of Wigner functions. The energy quantization rule has been found. Transition to massless case of electromagnetic field is specified, and electromagnetic solutions in Lorentz gauge have been constructed. In the second part, the problem of a particle with spin 1 is considered on the base of 5-dimensional wave equation specified in the same static coordinates. In the third part, a rarely used approach, based on tetrad form of Maxwell equations in complex representation is examined in the anti de Sitter model.
