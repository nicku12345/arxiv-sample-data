DB boundary conditions have been simulated in terms of perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary for transverse electric modes and perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) for transverse magnetic modes. Electric and magnetic fields inside the dielectric region of a parallel plate DB boundary waveguide have been derived and fractional curl operator has been utilized to study the fractional parallel plate DB waveguide. Field behavior as well as transverse impedance of the guide walls have been studied with respect to the fractional parameter describing the order of fractional curl operator. The results are also compared with the corresponding results for fractional waveguides with PEC walls.
