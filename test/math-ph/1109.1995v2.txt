We consider a non compact, complete manifold {\bf{M}} of finite area with cuspidal ends. The generic cusp is isomorphic to {\bf{X}}\times ]1,+\infty [ with metric ds^2=(h+dy^2)/y^{2\delta}. {\bf{X}} is a compact manifold with nonzero first Betti number equipped with the metric h. For a one-form A on {\bf{M}} such that in each cusp A is a non exact one-form on the boundary at infinity, we prove that the magnetic Laplacian -\Delta_A=(id+A)^\star (id+A) satisfies the Weyl asymptotic formula with sharp remainder. We deduce an upper bound for the counting function of the embedded eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator -\Delta =-\Delta_0.
