Rarita-Schwinger approach to description of a massive spin 3/2 particle is investigated in static coordinates of the de Sitter space-time. The general covariant system, derived from the relevant Lagrangian, is presented as a main wave equation and additional constraints in the form of first order deferential and algebraic relations. With the use of an extended Schr\"{o}dinger tetrad basis and technique of Wigner D-functions the separation of the variable performed. 16 radial equations reduce to 8 ones through diagonalization of P-inversion operator for spin 3/2 field.
