This paper analyzes the scattering theory for periodic tight-binding Hamiltonians perturbed by a finite range impurity. The classical energy gradient flow is used to construct a conjugate (or dilation) operator to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. For dimension d\geq 3 the wave operator is given by an explicit formula in terms of this dilation operator, the free resolvent and the perturbation. From this formula the scattering and time delay operators can be read off. Using the index theorem approach, a Levinson theorem is proved which also holds in presence of embedded eigenvalues and threshold singularities.
