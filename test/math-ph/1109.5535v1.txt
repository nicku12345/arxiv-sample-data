Linear differential equations of arbitrary order with polynomial coefficients are considered. Specifically, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polynomial solutions of a given degree are obtained for these equations. An algorithm to determine these conditions and to construct the polynomial solutions is given. The effectiveness of this algorithmic approach is illustrated by applying it to several differential equations that arise in mathematical physics.
