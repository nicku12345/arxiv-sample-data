In this paper, we study approximate cloaking of active devices for the Helmholtz equation in the whole space of dimension 2 or 3 using the scheme introduced by Kohn, Shen, Vogelius, and Weinstein in \cite{KohnShenVogeliusWeinstein}. More precisely, we assess the degree of invisibility, determine the limit of the field inside the cloaked and cloaking regions, and show that the scheme is unstable with respect to the material parameters. As a consequence, we obtain some feasible properties of "perfect" cloaking.
