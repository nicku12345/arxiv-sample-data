Consider an infinite linear mass-spring system and a modification of it obtained by changing the first mass and spring of the system. We give results on the interplay of the spectra of such systems and on the reconstruction of the system from its spectrum and the one of the modified system. Furthermore, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be the spectra of the mass-spring system and the perturbed one.
