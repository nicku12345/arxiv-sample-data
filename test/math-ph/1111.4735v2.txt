We consider the semi-relativistic system of N gravitating Bosons with gravitation constant G. The time evolution of the system is described by the relativistic dispersion law, and we assume the mean-field scaling of the interaction where N \to \infty and G \to 0 while GN = \lambda fixed. In the super-critical regime of large \lambda, we introduce the regularized interaction where the cutoff vanishes as N \to \infty. We show that the difference between the many-body semi-relativistic Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics and the corresponding semi-relativistic Hartree dynamics is at most of order N^{-1} for all \lambda, i.e., the result covers the sub-critical regime and the super-critical regime. The N dependence of the bound is optimal.
