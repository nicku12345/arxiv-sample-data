For any massless, irreducible representation of the covering of the proper, orthochronous Poincar\'e group we construct covariant, free quantum fields that generate the representation space from the vacuum and are localized in semi-infinite strings in the sense of commutation or anti-commutation of the field operators at space-like separation of the strings.
