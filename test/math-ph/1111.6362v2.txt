We investigate the assymptotic behaviour of the modeling error in approximate deconvolution model in the 3D periodic case, when the order N of deconvolution goes to \infty. We consider successively the generalised Helmholz filters of order p and the Gaussian filter. For Helmholz filters, we estimate the rate of convergence to zero thanks to energy budgets, Gronwall's Lemma and sharp inequalities about Fouriers coefficients of the residual stress. We next show why the same analysis does not allow to conclude convergence to zero of the error modeling in the case of Gaussian filter, leaving open issues.
