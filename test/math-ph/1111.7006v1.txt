The essence of romance is mystery. In this talk, given in honor of the 60th birthday of Michio Jimbo, I will explore the meaning of this for the Ising model beginning in 1946 with Bruria Kaufman and Willis Lamb, continuing with the wedding by Jimbo and Miwa in 1980 of the Ising model with the Painlev{\'e} VI equation which had been first discovered by Picard in 1889. I will conclude with the current fascination of the magnetic susceptibility and explore some of the mysteries still outstanding.
