We explore in this paper some orthogonal polynomials which are naturally associated to certain families of coherent states, often referred to as nonlinear coherent states in the quantum optics literature. Some examples turn out to be known orthogonal polynomials but in many cases we encounter a general class of new orthogonal polynomials for which we establish several qualitative results.
