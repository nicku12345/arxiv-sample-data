We consider a large neutral molecule with total nuclear charge Z in a model with self-generated classical magnetic field and where the kinetic energy of the electrons is treated relativistically. To ensure stability, we assume that Z \alpha < 2/\pi, where \alpha denotes the fine structure constant. We are interested in the ground state energy in the simultaneous limit Z \rightarrow \infty, \alpha \rightarrow 0 such that \kappa=Z \alpha is fixed. The leading term in the energy asymptotics is independent of \kappa, it is given by the Thomas-Fermi energy of order Z^{7/3} and it is unchanged by including the self-generated magnetic field. We prove the first correction term to this energy, the so-called Scott correction of the form S(\alpha Z) Z^2. The current paper extends the result of \cite{SSS} on the Scott correction for relativistic molecules to include a self-generated magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the corresponding Scott correction function S, first identified in \cite{SSS}, is unchanged by including a magnetic field. We also prove new Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the relativistic kinetic energy with magnetic fields.
