The aim of this Short Note is to highlight that the {\it generalized grey Brownian motion} (ggBm) is an anomalous diffusion process driven by a fractional integral equation in the sense of Erd\'elyi-Kober, and for this reason here it is proposed to call such family of diffusive processes as {\it Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional diffusion}. The ggBm is a parametric class of stochastic processes that provides models for both fast and slow anomalous diffusion. This class is made up of self-similar processes with stationary increments and it depends on two real parameters: 0 < \alpha \le 2 and 0 < \beta \le 1. It includes the fractional Brownian motion when 0 < \alpha \le 2 and \beta=1, the time-fractional diffusion stochastic processes when 0 < \alpha=\beta <1, and the standard Brownian motion when \alpha=\beta=1. In the ggBm framework, the Mainardi function emerges as a natural generalization of the Gaussian distribution recovering the same key role of the Gaussian density for the standard and the fractional Brownian motion.
