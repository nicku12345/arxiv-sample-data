Building on earlier work, we have given in our paper in Contemporary Mathematics 535, 195-213, 2011 (referred here as [TS]) a proof of existence of Abrikosov vortex lattices in the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity and have shown that the triangular lattice gives the lowest energy per lattice cell. After [TS] was published, we realized that it proves a stronger result than was stated there. This result is recorded in the present paper. The proofs remain the same as in [TS], apart from some streamlining.
