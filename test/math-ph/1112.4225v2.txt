We show that the two couple equations derived by approximate symmetry method and approximate homotopy symmetry method are connected by a transformation for the perturbed PDEs. Consequently, approximate homotopy series solutions can be obtained by acting the transformation on the known solutions by approximate symmetry method. Applications to the Cahn-Hilliard equation illustrate the effectiveness of the transformation.
