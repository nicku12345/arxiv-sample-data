The consideration of the Fermi - Bose duality of the Dirac equation with arbitrary mass has been continued. The bosonic solutions of this equation in the Foldy - Wouthuysen representation are found. The Bargman - Wigner analysis of additional solutions and comparison with standard fermionic solutions are carried out. The evident demonstration of additional bosonic features of the Foldy - Wouthuysen and Dirac equation is presented.
