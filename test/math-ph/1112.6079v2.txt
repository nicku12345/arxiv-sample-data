To solve the combinatorial optimization problems especially the minimal Vertex-cover problem with high efficiency, is a significant task in theoretical computer science and many other subjects. Aiming at detecting the solution space of Vertex-cover, a new structure named interaction between nodes is defined and discovered for random graph, which results in the emergence of the frustration and long-range correlation phenomenon. Based on the backbones and interactions with a node adding process, we propose an Interaction and Backbone Evolution Algorithm to achieve the reduced solution graph, which has a direct correspondence to the solution space of Vertex-cover. By this algorithm, the whole solution space can be obtained strictly when there is no leaf-removal core on the graph and the odd cycles of unfrozen nodes bring great obstacles to its efficiency. Besides, this algorithm possesses favorable exactness and has good performance on random instances even with high average degrees. The interaction with the algorithm provides a new viewpoint to solve Vertex-cover, which will have a wide range of applications to different types of graphs, better usage of which can lower the computational complexity for solving Vertex-cover.
