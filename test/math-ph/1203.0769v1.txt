This study generalizes the supersymmetric coherent states introduced by Aragone and Zypman in 1986. The Hamiltonian of the supersymmetric quantum harmonic oscillator leads to the definition of the generalized supersymmetric annihilation operators as a 3-parameter family. Their eigenstates are the generalized supercoherent states, which can be calculated explicitly for three relevant regions of parameter space. The uncertainty in position and momentum is discussed, with specific concentration on where the uncertainty is saturated, where it is bounded, and where it is unbounded.
