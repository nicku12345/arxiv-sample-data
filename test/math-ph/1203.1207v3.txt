We prove exponential spectral localization in a two-particle lattice Anderson model, with a short-range interaction and external random i.i.d. potential, at sufficiently low energies. The proof is based on the multi-particle multi-scale analysis developed earlier by Chulaevsky and Suhov (2009) in the case of high disorder. Our method applies to a larger class of random potentials than in Aizenman and Warzel (2009) where dynamical localization was proved with the help of the fractional moment method.
