Main properties of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory are investigated in a 2-dimensional twisted Moyal plane, generated by vector fields X_{a}=e_{a}^{\mu}(x)\partial_{\mu}; the dynamical effects are induced by a non trivial tensor e_{a}^{\mu}(x). Connections in such a NC space are defined. Symmetry analysis is performed and related NC action is proved to be invariant under defined NC gauge transformations. A locally conserved Noether current is explicitly computed. Both commuting and noncommutative vector fields X_{a} are considered.
