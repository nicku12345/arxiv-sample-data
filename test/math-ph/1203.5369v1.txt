The Hamiltonian analysis for the Euler and Second-Chern classes is performed. We show that, in spite of the fact that the Second-Chern and Euler invariants give rise to the same equations of motion, their corresponding symplectic structures on the phase space are different, therefore, one can expect different quantum formulations. In addition, the symmetries of actions written as a BF-like theory that lead to Yang-Mills equations of motion are studied. A close relationship with the results obtained in previous works for the Second-Chern and Euler classes is found.
