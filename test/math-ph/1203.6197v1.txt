For a class of long-range potentials, including ultra-strong perturbations of the attractive Coulomb potential in dimension d\geq3, we introduce a stationary scattering theory for Schr\"odinger operators which is regular at zero energy. In particular it is well defined at this energy, and we use it to establish a characterization there of the set of generalized eigenfunctions in an appropriately adapted Besov space generalizing parts of \cite{DS3}. Principal tools include global solutions to the eikonal equation and strong radiation condition bounds.
