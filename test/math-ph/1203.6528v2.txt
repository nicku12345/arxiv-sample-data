We find the all solutions to the sl_q(2)-invariant multi-parametric Yang-Baxter equations (YBE) at q=i defined on the cyclic (semi-cyclic, nilpotent) representations of the algebra. We are deriving the solutions in form of the linear combinations over the sl_q(2)-invariant objects - projectors. The direct construction of the projector operators at roots of unity gives us an opportunity to consider all the possible cases, including also degenerated one, when the number of the projectors becomes larger, and various type of solutions are arising, and as well as the inhomogeneous case. We are giving a full classification of the YBE solutions for the considered representations. A specific character of the solutions is the existence of the arbitrary functions.
