The discrete orthogonality of special function families, called C- and S-functions, which are derived from the characters of compact simple Lie groups, is described in Hrivn\'ak and Patera (2009 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42 385208). Here, the results of Hrivn\'ak and Patera are extended to two additional recently discovered families of special functions, called S^s- and S^l-functions. The main result is an explicit description of their pairwise discrete orthogonality within each family, when the functions are sampled on finite fragments F^s_M and F^l_M of a lattice in any dimension n\geq2 and of any density controlled by M, and of the symmetry of the weight lattice of any compact simple Lie group with two different lengths of roots.
