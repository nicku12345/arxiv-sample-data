We consider a system of a quantum particle interacting with a quantum field and an external potential V(\bx). The Hamiltonian is defined by a quadratic form H^V = H^0 + V(\bx), where H^0 is a quadratic form which preserves the total momentum. H^0 and H^V are assumed to be bounded from below. We give a criterion for the positivity of the binding energy E_\mathrm{bin} = E^0-E^V, where E^0 and E^V are the ground state energies of H^0 and H^V. As examples of the result, the positivity of the binding energy of the semi-relativistic Pauli-Fierz model and Nelson type Hamiltonian is proved.
