Position distributions of constituent particles of the perfect Bose-gas trapped in exponentially and polynomially anisotropic boxes are investigated by means of the boson random point fields (processes) and by the spatial random distribution of particle density. Our results include the case of \textit{generalised} Bose-Einstein Condensation. For exponentially anisotropic quasi two-dimensional system (SLAB), we obtain \textit{three} qualitatively different particle density distributions. They correspond to the \textit{normal} phase, the quasi-condensate phase (type III generalised condensation) and to the phase when the type III and the type I Bose condensations co-exist. An interesting feature is manifested by the type II generalised condensation in one-directional polynomially anisotropic system (BEAM). In this case the particle density distribution rests truly random even in the \textit{macroscopic} scaling limit.
