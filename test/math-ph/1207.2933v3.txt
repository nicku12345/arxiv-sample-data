We propose and solve exactly the Schr\"odinger equation of a bound quantum system consisting in four particles moving on a real line with both translationally invariant four particles interactions of Wolfes type \cite{Wolf74} and additional non translationally invariant four-body potentials. We also generalize and solve exactly this problem in any D-dimensional space by providing full eigensolutions and the corresponding energy spectrum. We discuss the domain of the coupling constant where the irregular solutions becomes physically acceptable
