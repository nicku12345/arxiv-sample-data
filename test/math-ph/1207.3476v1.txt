As part of condensed-matter physics, the field of Anderson localization concerns the study of conductance of electrons in a random medium. We summarize and explain the results obtained in "A new numerical approach to Anderson (de)localization" from a physics perspective. Further, we discover a relationship with the so-called Thouless criterion - a dimensionless scaling parameter often used as the sole indicator whether or not the system exhibits Anderson localization.
