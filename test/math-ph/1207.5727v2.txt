We study diffuse phase interfaces under asymmetric double-well potential energies with degenerate minima and demonstrate that the limiting sharp profile, for small interface energy cost, on a finite space interval is in general not symmetric and its position depends exclusively on the second derivatives of the potential energy at the two minima (phases). We discuss an application of the general result to porous media in the regime of solid-fluid segregation under an applied pressure and describe the interface between a fluid-rich and a fluid-poor phase. Asymmetric double-well potential energies are also relevant in a very different field of physics as that of Brownian motors. An intriguing analogy between our result and the direction of the dc soliton current in asymmetric substrate driven Brownian motors is pointed out.
