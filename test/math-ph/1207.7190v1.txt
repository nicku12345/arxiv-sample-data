We show absence of positive eigenvalues for generalized 2-body hard- core Schroedinger operators under the condition of bounded strictly convex obstacles. A scheme for showing absence of positive eigenvalues for generalized N -body hard-core Schroedinger operators, N \geq 2, is presented. This scheme involves high energy resolvent estimates, and for N = 2 it is implemented by a Mourre commutator type method. A particular example is the Helium atom with the assumption of infinite mass and finite extent nucleus.
