We develop further the consequences of the irreducible-Boolean classification established in Ref. [9]; which have the advantage of allowing strong statistical calculations in disordered Boolean function models, such as the \textit{NK}-Kauffman networks. We construct a ring-isomorphism  mathfrak{R}_K {i_1, ..., i_\lambda} \cong \mathcal{P}^2 -[K]  of the set of reducible K-Boolean functions that are reducible in the Boolean arguments with indexes {i_1, ..., i_\lambda}; and the double power set \mathcal{P}^2 [K], of the first K natural numbers. This allows us, among other things, to calculate the number \varrho_K (\lambda, \omega) of K-Boolean functions which are \lambda -irreducible with weight \omega. \varrho_K (\lambda, \omega) is a fundamental quantity in the study of the stability of \textit{NK}-Kauffman networks against changes in their connections between their Boolean functions; as well as in the mean field study of their dynamics when Boolean irreducibility is taken into account.
