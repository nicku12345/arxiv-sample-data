By using a real matrix translation, we propose a coupled eigenvalue problem for octonionic operators. In view of possible applications in quantum mechanics, we also discuss the hermiticity of such operators. Previous difficulties in formulating a consistent octonionic Hilbert space are solved by using the new coupled eigenvalue problem and introducing an appropriate scalar product for the probability amplitudes.
