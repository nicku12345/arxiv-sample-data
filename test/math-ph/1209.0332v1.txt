Many Lagrangians of physical theories can be expressed as eigenvalues of certain, relatively simple, matrices involving Dirac gamma matrices. We give concrete examples for Lagrangian corresponding to a point particle coupled to electromagnetic field, electrodynamics, nonabelian gauge theories, extended objects and gravity. We also discuss (in case of a point particle) what are the implications of the least action principle applied to matrix Lagrangians.
