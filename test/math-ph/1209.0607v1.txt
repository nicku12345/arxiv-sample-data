We present analytic self-similar or traveling wave solutions for a one-dimensional coupled system of continuity, compressible Euler and heat conduction equations. Different kind of equation of states are investigated. In certain forms of the equation of state one can arrive to a picture regarding the long time behavior of density and pressure. The impact of these quantities on the evolution of temperature is also discussed.
