A series of sharp existence and uniqueness theorems are established for the multiple vortex solutions in the supersymmetric Chern--Simons--Higgs theory formalism of Aharony, Bergman, Jaferis, and Maldacena, for which the Higgs bosons and Dirac fermions lie in the bifundamental representation of the general gauge symmetry group U(N)\times U(N). The governing equations are of the BPS type and derived by Kim, Kim, Kwon, and Nakajima in the mass-deformed framework labeled by a continuous parameter.
