A model for three dimensional detonation is proposed based on the approximation that the detonation thickness is small compared to the characteristic scales of the fluid motion. In this framework detonations are treated as a modified hydrodynamic discontinuity. The altered Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions take into account the internal structure of the detonation including the chemical reaction. The position of the discontinuity surface and the corresponding jump conditions are derived from first principles. The final modified conditions are dependent on curvature, flame thickness and stretching and allow for simple physical interpretation.
