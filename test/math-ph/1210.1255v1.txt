For the two dimensional Schr\"odinger equation in a bounded domain, we prove uniqueness of determination of potentials in W^1_p(\Omega),\,\, p>2 in the case where we apply all possible Neumann data supported on an arbitrarily non-empty open set \widetilde\Gamma of the boundary and observe the corresponding Dirichlet data on \widetilde{\Gamma}. An immediate consequence is that one can uniquely determine a conductivity in W^3_p(\Omega) with p>2 by measuring the voltage on an open subset of the boundary corresponding to current supported in the same set.
