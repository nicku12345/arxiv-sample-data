We consider asymptotics of the ground state energy of heavy atoms and molecules in the strong external magnetic field and derive it including Schwinger and Dirac corrections (if magnetic field is not too strong). We also consider related topics: an excessive negative charge, ionization energy and excessive positive charge when atoms can still bind into molecules.
