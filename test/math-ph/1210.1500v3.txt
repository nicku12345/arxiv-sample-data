In this article we prove the existence of solutions to the coagulation equation with singular kernels. We use weighted L^1-spaces to deal with the singularities in order to obtain regular solutions. The Smoluchowski kernel is covered by our proof. The weak L^1 compactness methods are applied to suitably chosen approximating equations as a base of our proof. A more restrictive uniqueness result is also mentioned.
