We show asymptotic completeness of two-body scattering for a class of translation invariant models describing a single quantum particle (the electron) linearly coupled to a massive scalar field (bosons). Our proof is based on a recently established Mourre estimate for these models. In contrast to previous approaches, it requires no number cutoff, no restriction on the particle-field coupling strength, and no restriction on the magnitude of total momentum. Energy, however, is restricted by the two-boson threshold, admitting only scattering of a dressed electron and a single asymptotic boson. The class of models we consider include the UV-cutoff Nelson and polaron models.
