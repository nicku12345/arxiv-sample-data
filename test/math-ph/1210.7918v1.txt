In this paper, we present the Dirac equation for the Mobius-square-Yukawa potentials including the tensor interaction term within the framework of pseudospin and spin symmetry limit with arbitrary spin-orbit quantum number . We obtained the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions using the supersymmetry method. The limiting cases of this potential model reduce to the Deng-Fan, Yukawa and Coulomb potentials, respectively
