We establish a Mermin--Wagner type theorem for Gibbs states on infinite random Lorentzian triangulations (LT) arising in models of quantum gravity. Such a triangulation is naturally related to the distribution \sf P of a critical Galton--Watson tree, conditional upon non-extinction. At the vertices of the triangles we place classical spins taking values in a torus M of dimension d, with a given group action of a torus {\tt G} of dimension d'\leq d. In the main body of the paper we assume that the spins interact via a two-body nearest-neighbor potential U(x,y) invariant under the action of {\tt G}. We analyze quenched Gibbs measures generated by U and prove that, for \sf P-almost all Lorentzian triangulations, every such Gibbs measure is {\tt G}-invariant, which means the absence of spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking.
