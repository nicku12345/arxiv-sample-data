This paper is the second in a series of papers considering symmetry properties of a bosonic quantum system over an 2D graph, with continuous spins, in the spirit of the Mermin--Wagner theorem. Here we consider bosonic systems on bi-dimensional graphs where particles can jump from a vertex to another (a generalized Hubbard model). The Feynman--Kac representation is used for proving that if the local Hamiltonians are invariant under a continuous group of transformations {\tt G} (a Euclidean space or a torus of dimension d' acting on a torus of dimension d\geq d') then any infinite-volume Gibbs state from a certain class (introduced in the paper) is also {\tt G}-invariant.
