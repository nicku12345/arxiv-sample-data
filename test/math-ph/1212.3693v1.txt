Previous results about the non trivial solution of the \Phi^4-equations of motion for the Green's functions in the Euclidean\ space (of 0\leq r\leq 4 dimensions) in the Wightman Quantum Field theory framework, are reviewed in the 0 - dimensional case from the following three aspects: The structure of the subset \Phi \subset {\cal B} characterized by the signs and "splitting" (factorization properties) is reffined and more explictly described by a subset \Phi_0\subset \Phi   The local contractivity of the corresponding \Phi ^4_0 mappping is established in a neighborhood of a precise nontrivial sequence H_0\in \Phi_0 using a new norm in the Banach space  {\cal B}. A new \Phi ^4_0 iteration is defined in the neighborhood of this sequence H_0\in \Phi_0  and our numerical study displays clearly the stability of \Phi_0 (the splitting, the bounds and sign properties are perfectly illustrated), and a rapid convergence to the unique fixed point H^* \in \Phi_0.
