PT-symmetric quantum mechanics is an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose and complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space-time reflection symmetry (PT-symmetry). A Hamiltonian H is said to be PT-symmetric if it commutes with the operator PT. The key point of PT-symmetric quantum theory is to build a new positive definite inner product on the given Hilbert space so that the given Hamiltonian is Hermitian with respect to the new inner product.   The aim of this note is to give further mathematical discussions on this theory. Especially, concepts of PT-frames, CPT-frames on a Hilbert space and for a Hamiltonian are proposed, their existence and constructions are discussed.
