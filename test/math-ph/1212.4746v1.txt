For the large sparse systems of weakly nonlinear equations arising in the discretizations of many classical differential and integral equations, this paper presents a class of synchronous parallel multi-splitting two-stage two-parameter over-relaxation (TOR) methods for getting their solutions by the high-speed multiprocessor systems. Under suitable assumptions, we study the global convergence properties of these synchronous multi-splitting two-stage TOR methods.
