In this paper the representation of A_{\kk}(2) algebra given by Daoud and Kibler [M.Daoud and M.Kibler, J.Phys.A 43 115303 (2010), 45 244036 (2012)] is investigated. It is shown that the new generators are necessary for consistency of the algebra. The multi-mode extension of A_{\kk}(2) algebra, which is called A_{\kk}(d) algebra, is also obtained. The positivity condition of the energy spectrum is also investigated for A_{\kk}(2) algebra and A_{\kk}(d) algebra.
