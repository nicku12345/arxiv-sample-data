The Heisenberg algebra is first deformed with the set of parameters {q, l, \lambda} to generate a new family of generalized coherent states. In this framework, the matrix elements of relevant operators are exactly computed. A proof on sub-Poissonian character of the statistics of the main deformed states is provided. This property is used to determine a generalized metric.   A unified method of calculating structure functions from commutation relations of deformed single-mode oscillator algebras is then presented. A natural approach to building coherent states associated to deformed algebras is deduced. Known deformed algebras are given as illustration.   Futhermore, we generalize a class of two-parameter deformed Heisenberg algebras related to meromorphic functions, called {\cal R}(p,q)-deformed algebra. Relevant families of coherent states maps are probed and their corresponding hypergeometric series are computed. The latter generalizes known hypergeometric series and gives to a generalization of the binomial theorem.   The involved notions of differentiation and integration generalize the usual q- and (p,q)-differentiation and integration. A Hopf algebra structure compatible with the {\cal R}(p,q)-algebra is deduced.   We succeed in giving a new characterization of Rogers- Szeg\"o polynomials, called {\cal R}(p,q)-deformed Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials, by their three-term recursion relations and the associated quantum algebra built with corresponding creation and annihilation operators. Continuous {\cal R}(p,q)-deformed Hermite polynomials and their recursion relation are also deduced. Novel algebraic relations are provided and discussed. The whole formalism is performed in a unified way, generalizing known relevant results which are straightforwardly derived as particular cases.
