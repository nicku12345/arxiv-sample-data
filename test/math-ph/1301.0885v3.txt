The purpose of the paper is to study the foundations of the main axioms of Quantum Mechanics. From a general study of the mathematical properties of the models used in Physics to represent systems, we prove that the states of a system can be represented in a Hilbert space, that a self-adjoint operator is associated to any observable, that the result of a measure must be the eigen value of the operator and appear with the usual probability. Furthermore an equivalent of the Wigner's theorem holds, which leads to the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. These results are based on well known mathematics, and do not involve any specific hypothesis in Physics. They validate and explain the methods currently used, which are made simpler and safer, and open new developments. In the third edition of this paper developments have been added about the estimation of physical anomalies.
