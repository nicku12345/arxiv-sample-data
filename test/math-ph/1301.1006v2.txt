The 2D space-fractional Schrodinger equation in the time-independent and time-dependent cases for the scattering problem in the fractional quantum mechanics is studied. We define and give the mathematical expression of the Green's functions for the two cases. The asymptotic formulas of the Green's functions are also given, and applied to get the approximate wave functions for the fractional quantum scattering problems.
