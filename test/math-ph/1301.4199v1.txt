We generalize eigen-phase preserving (EPP) supersymmetric (SUSY) transformations to N>2 channel Schr\"odinger equation with equal thresholds. It is established that EPP SUSY transformations exist only in the case of even number of channels, N=2M. A single EPP SUSY transformation provides an M(M-1)+2 parametric deformation of the matrix Hamiltonian without affecting eigen-phase shifts of the scattering matrix.
