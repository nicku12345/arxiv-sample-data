We consider discrete Schr\"odinger operators of the form H=-\Delta +V on \ell^2(\Z^d), where \Delta is the discrete Laplacian and V is a bounded potential. Given \Gamma \subset \Z^d, the \Gamma-trimming of H is the restriction of H to \ell^2(\Z^d\setminus\Gamma), denoted by H_\Gamma. We investigate the dependence of the ground state energy E_\Gamma(H)=\inf \sigma (H_\Gamma) on \Gamma. We show that for relatively dense proper subsets \Gamma of \Z^d we always have E_\Gamma(H)>E_\emptyset(H). We use this lifting of the ground state energy to establish Wegner estimates and localization at the bottom of the spectrum for \Gamma-trimmed Anderson models, i.e., Anderson models with the random potential supported by the set \Gamma
