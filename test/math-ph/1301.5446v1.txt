It is explored a model of compact Riemann surfaces in genus two, represented geometrically by two-parametric hyperbolic octagons with an order four automorphism. We compute the generators of associated isometry group and give a real-analytic description of corresponding Teichm\"uller space, parametrized by the Fenchel-Nielsen variables, in terms of geometric data. We state the structure of parameter space by computing the Weil-Petersson symplectic two-form and analyzing the isoperimetric orbits. The results of the paper may be interesting due to their applications to the quantum geometry, chaotic systems and low-dimensional gravity.
