This work describes coherent states for a physical system governed by a Hamiltonian operator, in two dimensional space, of spinless charged particles subject to a perpendicular magnetic field B, coupled with a harmonic potential. The underlying su(1, 1) Lie algebra and Barut-Girardello coherent states are constructed and discussed. Then, the Berezin - Klauder - Toeplitz quantization, also known as coherent state (or anti-Wick) quantization, is discussed. The thermodynamics of such a quantum gas system is elaborated and analyzed.
