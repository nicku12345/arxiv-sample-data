The detailed consideration of the relativistic canonical quantum-mechanical model of an arbitrary spin-multiplet is given. The group-theoretical analysis of the algebra of experimentally observables physical quantities for the spin 1/2 doublet is presented. It is shown that both the Foldy-Wouthuysen equation for the fermionic spin 1/2 doublet and the Dirac equation in its local representation are the consequences of the relativistic canonical quantum mechanics of the corresponding doublet. The mathematically well-defined consideration on the level of modern axiomatic approaches to the field theory is provided. The hypothesis of the antiparticle negative mass is discussed briefly in the section conclusions.
