Wada and Suyari proposed a two-parameter generalization of Shannon-Khinchin axioms (TGSK axioms) [T. Wada and H. Suyari, Physics Letters A, 368(3)]. We derive a new class of entropies which differs from Wada-Suyari's class by fixing the incorrectness which occurs in the mentioned paper. Also, we consider a two-parameter class of entropies derived from the maxent principle proposed in [Kaniadakis, G. and Lissia, M. and Scarfone, AM, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 340(1)]. We rederived this class by changing initial condition, obtaining the same class as our class derived from TGSK axioms.
