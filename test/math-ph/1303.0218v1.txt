In this era of an increased interest in loop theory, the Einstein velocity addition law has fresh resonance. One of the most fascinating aspects of recent work in Einstein's special theory of relativity is the emergence of special grouplike loops. The special grouplike loops, known as gyrocommutative gyrogroups, have thrust the Einstein velocity addition law, which previously has operated mostly in the shadows, into the spotlight.
