The history of linear differential equations is over 350 years. By using Frobenius method and putting the power series expansion into linear differential equations, the recursive relation of coefficients starts to appear. There can be between two and infinity number of coefficients in the recurrence relation in the power series expansion. During this period mathematicians developed analytic solutions of only two term recursion relation in closed forms. Currently the analytic solution of three term recurrence relation is unknown. In this paper I will generalize the three term recurrence relation in the linear differential equation. This paper is 2nd out of 10 in series "Special functions and three term recurrence formula (3TRF)". The next paper in series deals with the power series expansion in closed forms of Heun function by Choun [arXiv:1303.0830]. The rest of the papers in the series show how to solve mathematical equations having three term recursion relations and go on producing the exact solutions of some of the well known special functions including: Mathieu, Heun, Biconfluent Heun and Lame equations. See section IX for all the papers and short descriptions in the series.
