Inverse limits and profinite groups are used in a quantum mechanical context. Two cases are considered. A quantum system with positions in the profinite group {\mathbb Z}_p and momenta in the group {\mathbb Q}_p/{\mathbb Z}_p; and a quantum system with positions in the profinite group {\hat {\mathbb Z}} and momenta in the group {\mathbb Q}/{\mathbb Z}. The corresponding Schwatz-Bruhat spaces of wavefunctions and the Heisenberg-Weyl groups are discussed. The sets of subsystems of these systems are studied from the point of view of partial order theory. It is shown that they are directed-complete partial orders. It is also shown that they are topological spaces with T_0 topologies, and this is used to define continuity of various physical quantities. The physical meaning of profinite groups, non-Archimedean metrics, partial orders and T_0 topologies, in a quantum mechanical context, is discussed.
