In this paper, we get the Kastler-Kalau-Walze theorem associated to Dirac operators with torsion on compact manifolds with boundary. We give two kinds of operator-theoretic explanations of the gravitational action in the case of 4-dimensional compact manifolds with flat boundary. Furthermore, we get the Kastler-Kalau-Walze type theorem for four dimensional complex manifolds associated with nonminimal operators.
