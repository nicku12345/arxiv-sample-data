There exists two types of semi-direct products between a Lie group G and a vector space V.   The left semi-direct product, G \ltimes V, can be constructed when G is equipped with a left action on V.   Similarly, the right semi-direct product, G \rtimes V, can be constructed when G is equipped with a right action on V.   In this paper, we will construct a new type of semi-direct product, G \Join V, which can be seen as the `sum' of a right and left semi-direct product.   We then parallel existing semi-direct product Euler-Poincar\'{e} theory.   We find that the group multiplication, the Lie bracket, and the diamond operator can each be seen as a sum of the associated concepts in right and left semi-direct product theory.   Finally, we conclude with a toy example and the group of 2-jets of diffeomorphisms above a fixed point.   This final example has potential use in the creation of particle methods for problems on diffeomorphism groups.
