We provide a new, simple general proof of the formulas giving the infinite sums \sigma(p,\nu) of the inverse even powers 2p of the zeros \xi_{\nu k} of the regular Bessel functions J_{\nu}(\xi), as functions of \nu. We also give and prove a general formula for certain linear combinations of these sums, which can be used to derive the formulas for \sigma(p,\nu) by purely linear-algebraic means, in principle for arbitrarily large powers. We prove that these sums are always given by a ratio of two polynomials on \nu, with integer coefficients. We complete the set of known formulas for the smaller values of p, extend it to p=9, and point out a connection with the Riemann zeta function, which allows us to calculate some of its values.
