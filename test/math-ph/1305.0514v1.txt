In the first part of this paper we show how a simple system, a 2-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, can be described in terms of pseudo-bosonic variables. This apparently {\em strange} choice is useful when the {\em natural} Hilbert space of the system, L^2({\bf R}^2) in this case, is, for some reason, not the most appropriate. This is exactly what happens for the D_2 type quantum Calogero model considered in the second part of the paper, where the Hilbert space L^2({\bf R}^2) appears to be an unappropriate choice, since the eigenvectors of the relevant hamiltonian are not square-integrable. Then we discuss how a certain intertwining operator arising from the model can be used to fix a different Hilbert space more {\em useful}.
