It is shown that second-order homogenization of a Cauchy-elastic dilute suspension of randomly distributed inclusions yields an equivalent second gradient (Mindlin) elastic material. This result is valid for both plane and three-dimensional problems and extends earlier findings by Bigoni and Drugan (Analytical derivation of Cosserat moduli via homogenization of heterogeneous elastic materials. J. Appl. Mech., 2007, 74, 741-753) from several points of view: (i.) the result holds for anisotropic phases with spherical or circular ellipsoid of inertia; (ii.) the displacement boundary conditions considered in the homogenization procedure is independent of the characteristics of the material; (iii.) a perfect energy match is found between heterogeneous and equivalent materials (instead of an optimal bound). The constitutive higher-order tensor defining the equivalent Mindlin solid is given in a surprisingly simple formula. Applications, treatment of material symmetries and positive definiteness of the effective higher-order constitutive tensor are deferred to Part II of the present article.
