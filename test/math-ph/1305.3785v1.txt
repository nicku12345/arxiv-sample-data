We investigate semi-classical properties of Maupertuis-Jacobi correspondence in 2-D for families of Hamiltonians (H_\lambda(x,\xi), {\cal H}_\lambda(x,\xi)), when {\cal H}_\lambda(x,\xi) is the perturbation of completely integrable Hamiltonian \widetilde{\cal H} veriying some isoenergetic non-degeneracy conditions. Assuming the Weyl h-PDO H^w_\lambda has only discrete spectrum near E, and the energy surface \{\widetilde{\cal H}={\cal E}\} is separated by some pairwise disjoint lagrangian tori, we show that most of eigenvalues for \hat H_\lambda near E are asymptotically degenerate as h\to0. This applies in particular for the determination of trapped modes by an island, in the linear theory of water-waves. We also consider quasi-modes localized near rational tori. Finally, we discuss breaking of Maupertuis-Jacobi correspondence on the equator of Katok sphere.
