On this short note, we apply the Mourre theory of the limiting absorption with {\it difference} type conditions on the potential, instead of conditions on the derivatives. In order that we modify the definition of the conjugate operator, and we apply the standard abstract Mourre theory. We also discuss examples to which the method applies.
