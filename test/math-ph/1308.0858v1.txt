Differential equations with convective terms such as the Burger's equation appear in many applications and have been the subject of intense research. In this paper we use a generalized form of Cole-Hopf transformation to relate the solutions of some of these nonlinear equations to the solutions of linear equations. In particular we consider generalized forms of Burger's equation and second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations with convective terms which can represent steady state one-dimensional convection.
