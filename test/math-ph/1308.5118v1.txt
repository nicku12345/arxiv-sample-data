In this paper estimates on the ground state energy of Fr\"ohlich N-polarons in electromagnetic fields in the strong coupling limit, \alpha\to\infty, are derived. It is shown that the ground state energy is given by \alpha^2 multiplied by the minimal energy of the corresponding Pekar-Tomasevich functional for N particles, up to an error term of order \alpha^{42/23}N^3. The potentials A,V are suitably rescaled in \alpha. As a corollary, binding of N-polarons for strong magnetic fields for large coupling constants is established.
