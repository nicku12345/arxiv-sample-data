This paper studies the connections between the zeros and their distribution functions for two particular Dirichlet L functions: the Riemann zeta function, and the Catalan beta function, also known as the Dirichlet beta function. It is shown that the Riemann hypothesis holds for the Dirichlet beta function L_{-4}(s) if and only if it holds for \zeta (s)- a particular case of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.
