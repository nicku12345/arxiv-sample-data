In this article, the new exact travelling wave solutions of the time-and space-fractional KdV-Burgers equation has been found. For this the fractional complex transformation have been implemented to convert nonlinear partial fractional differential equations to nonlinear ordinary differential equations, in the sense of the Jumarie's modified Riemann-Liouville derivative. Afterwards, the improved (G'/G)-expansion method can be implemented to celebrate the soliton solutions of KdV-Burger's equation of fractional order.
