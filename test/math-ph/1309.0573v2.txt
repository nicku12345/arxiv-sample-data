A brief review of the different ways of the Dirac equation derivation is given. The foundations of the relativistic canonical quantum mechanics of a fermionic doublet are formulated. In our approach the Dirac equation is derived from the main equation of relativistic canonical quantum mechanics. In the formalism of relativistic canonical quantum mechanics the absence of necessity to appeal for the conception of the negative mass of the antiparticle is shown.
