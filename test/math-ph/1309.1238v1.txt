This paper presents a parametrization of a degenerate density matrix. The problem needs to be approached first with a diagonalized form (the spectral representation) to deal with degeneracy. Such a form is useful for this parametrization in that the conditions to be a density matrix from a Hermitian matrix are applied only to a diagonal eigenvalue matrix, not a unitary matrix. Those conditions can be satisfied by parametrizing eigenvalues with squared spherical coordinates in dimension of the matrix. Degeneracy in eigenvalues brings symmetries between a eigenvalue matrix and a unitary matrix, which are realized in a form of a commuting unitary matrix, called a commutant. The associated redundant parameters in a unitary matrix have to be eliminated. It is realized in this paper that degrees of degeneracies can be defined as the total number of possible pairs of the same eigenvalues and one degree of degeneracy corresponds to one phase and one two dimensional rotation in a unitary matrix or a commutant. In this way all the degeneracies are identified and assigned to one phase-one rotation block. Therefore, a unitary matrix or a commutant is a product of these blocks and a general diagonal phase matrix. In physics a unitary matrix is often parametrized by rotation and phase matrices, called an angular representation here. There are many possible different phase configurations. It is often not a trivial matter whether a given parametrized unitary matrix is general. A simple diagram will be introduced to illustrate how to transform one phase configuration to another.
