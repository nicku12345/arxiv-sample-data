We give a self-contained and enriched review about topology properties in the rapidly growing field of topological states of matter (TSM). This review is mainly focus on the beautiful interplay of topology mathematics and condensed matter physics that issuing TSM. Fiber bundle theory is a powerful concept to describe the non-trivial topology properties underlying the physical system. So we briefly present some motivation of fiber bundle theory and following that several effective topological methods have been introduced to judge whether a fiber bundle is trivial or not. Next, we give some topological invariants that characterizes the non-trivial TSM in the non-interacting systems in all dimensions, which is called topological band theory. Following that, we review and generalize the topological response using topological field theory called Chern-Simons effective theory.   Finally, the classification of free-fermion systems have been studied by loop space and K-theory.
