A transformation method is applied to the second order ordinary differential equation satisfied by orthogonal polynomials to construct a family of exactly solvable quantum systems in any arbitrary dimensional space. Using the properties of orthogonal polynomials, the method transforms polynomial differential equation to D-dimensional radial Schrodinger equation which facilitates construction of exactly solvable quantum systems. The method is also applied using associated Laguerre and Hypergeometric polynomials. The quantum systems generated from other polynomials are also briefly highlighted.
