The Clifford bundle formalism (CBF) of differential forms and the theory of extensors acting on \mathcal{C\ell}(M,g) is first used for a fomulation of the intrinsic geometry of a differential manifold M equipped with a metric field \boldsymbol{g} of signature (p,q) and an arbitrary metric compatible connection \nabla introducing the torsion (2-1)-extensor field \tau, the curvature (2-2) extensor field \mathfrak{R} and (once fixing a gauge) the connection (1-2)-extensor \omega and the Ricci operator \boldsymbol{\partial}\wedge\boldsymbol{\partial} (where \boldsymbol{\partial} is the Dirac operator acting on sections of \mathcal{C\ell}(M,g)) which plays an important role in this paper. Next, using the CBF we give a thoughtful presentation the Riemann or the Lorentzian geometry of an orientable submanifold M (\dim M=m) living in a manifold \mathring{M} (such that \mathring{M}\simeq\mathbb{R}^{n} is equipped with a semi-Riemannian metric \boldsymbol{\mathring{g}} with signature (\mathring{p},\mathring{q}) and \ \mathring{p}+\mathring{q}=n and its Levi-Civita connection \mathring{D}) and where there is defined a metric \boldsymbol{g=i}^{\ast}\mathring{g}, where \boldsymbol{i}: M\rightarrow \mathring{M} is the inclusion map. We prove several equivalent forms for the curvature operator \mathfrak{R} of M. It is shown that the Ricci operator of M is the (negative) square of the shape operator \mathbf{S} of M. Also we disclose the relationship between the connection (1-2%)-extensor \omega and the shape biform \mathcal{S} (an object related to \mathbf{S}). We hope that our presentation will be useful for differential geometers and theoretical physists interested, e.g, in string and brane theories and relativity theory.
