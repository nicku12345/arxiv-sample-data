In this paper we study families of complex Hermite polynomials and construct deformed versions of them, using a GL(2,\mathbb{C}) transformation. This construction leads to the emergence of biorthogonal families of deformed complex Hermite polynomials, which we then study in the context of a two-dimensional model of noncommutative quantum mechanics.
