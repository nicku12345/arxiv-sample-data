We consider the free linear Schroedinger equation on a torus \mathbb T^d, perturbed by a Hamiltonian nonlinearity, driven by a random force and damped by a linear damping: u_t -i\Delta u +i\nu \rho |u|^{2q_*}u = - \nu f(-\Delta) u + \sqrt\nu\,\frac{d}{d t}\sum_{k\in \mathbb Z^d} b_k\beta^k(t)e^{ik\cdot x} \ .  Here u=u(t,x),\ x\in\mathbb T^d, 0<\nu\ll1, q_*\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}, f is a positive continuous function, \rho is a positive parameter and \beta^k(t) are standard independent complex Wiener processes. We are interested in limiting, as \nu\to0, behaviour of solutions for this equation and of its stationary measure. Writing the equation in the slow time \tau=\nu t, we prove that the limiting behaviour of the both is described by the effective equation  u_\tau+ f(-\Delta) u = -iF(u)+\frac{d}{d\tau}\sum b_k\beta^k(\tau)e^{ik\cdot x} \,  where the nonlinearity F(u) is made out of the resonant terms of the monomial  |u|^{2q_*}u. We explain the relevance of this result for the problem of weak turbulence.
