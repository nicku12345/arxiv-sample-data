We study the evolution of coherent structures in arbitrary turbulence phenomena, developing some tools, from non-archimedean analysis and algebraic geometry, in order to model its display. We match the scale-dependent, topological structure of the physical fields subsumed by these coherent structures with the phase portraits of some convenient, non-archimedean dynamical systems whose set we endow with a law of action. Finally, we obtain the proposition of an extremum principle for this action to define a geodesic path, as the modelized coherent structures evolve, and we delineate the conception of two experiments, derived from the fields of fluid and plasma turbulence, to test its efectiveness.
