We provide a negative answer to an old question in tight closure theory by showing that the containment x^3y^3 \in (x^4,y^4,z^4)^* in K[x,y,z]/(x^7+y^7-z^7) holds for infinitely many but not for almost all prime characteristics of the field K. This proves that tight closure exhibits a strong dependence on the arithmetic of the prime characteristic. The ideal (x,y,z) \subset K[x,y,z,u,v,w]/(x^7+y^7-z^7, ux^4+vy^4+wz^4+x^3y^3) has then the property that the cohomological dimension fluctuates arithmetically between 0 and 1.
