The goal of this paper is to show that the local Gr\"obner fan is a polyhedral fan for ideals in the ring of power series and the homogenized ring of analytic differential operators. We will also discuss about relations between the local Gr\"obner fan and the (global) Gr\"obner fan for a given ideal and algorithms of computing local Gr\"obner fans. In rings of differential operators, finiteness and convexity of local Gr\"obner fans were firstly proved by Assi, Castro-Jim\'enez and Granger. But they did not prove that they are polyhedral fans.
