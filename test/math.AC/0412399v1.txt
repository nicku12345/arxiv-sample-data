In commutative algebra, a Weitzenb\"ock derivation is a nonzero triangular linear derivation of the polynomial algebra K[x_1,...,x_m] in several variables over a field K of characteristic 0. The classical theorem of Weitzenb\"ock states that the algebra of constants is finitely generated. (This algebra coincides with the algebra of invariants of a single unipotent transformation.) In this paper we study the problem of finite generation of the algebras of constants of triangular linear derivations of finitely generated (not necessarily commutative or associative) algebras over K assuming that the algebras are free in some sense (in most of the cases relatively free algebras in varieties of associative or Lie algebras). In this case the algebra of constants also coincides with the algebra of invariants of some unipotent transformation. \par The main results are the following: 1. We show that the subalgebra of constants of a factor algebra can be lifted to the subalgebra of constants. 2. For all varieties of associative algebras which are not nilpotent in Lie sense the subalgebras of constants of the relatively free algebras of rank \geq 2 are not finitely generated. 3. We describe the generators of the subalgebra of constants for all factor algebras K< x,y>/I modulo a GL_2(K)-invariant ideal I. 4. Applying known results from commutative algebra, we construct classes of automorphisms of the algebra generated by two generic 2\times 2 matrices. We obtain also some partial results on relatively free Lie algebras.
