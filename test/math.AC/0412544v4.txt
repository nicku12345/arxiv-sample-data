Let (K, v) be a Henselian valued field satisfying the following conditions, for a given prime number p: (i) central division K-algebras of (finite) p-primary dimensions have Schur indices equal to their exponents; (ii) the value group v(K) properly includes its subgroup pv(K). The paper shows that if \hat K is the residue field of (K, v) and \hat R is an intermediate field of the maximal p-extension \hat K (p)/\hat K, then the natural homomorphism Br(\hat K) \to  Br(\hat R) of Brauer groups maps surjectively the p-component Br(\hat K)_{p} on Br(\hat R)_{p}. It proves that Br(\hat K)_{p} is divisible, if p > 2 or \hat K is a nonreal field, and that Br(\hat K)_{2} is of order 2 when \hat K is formally real. We also obtain that \hat R embeds as a \hat K-subalgebra in a central division \hat K-algebra \hat \Delta  if and only if the degree [\hat R\colon \hat K] divides the index of \hat \Delta .
