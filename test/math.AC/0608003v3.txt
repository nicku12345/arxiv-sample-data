Let K be a field, and let R = K[X] be the polynomial ring in an infinite collection X of indeterminates over K. Let {\mathfrak S}_{X} be the symmetric group of X. The group {\mathfrak S}_{X} acts naturally on R, and this in turn gives R the structure of a left module over the (left) group ring R[{\mathfrak S}_{X}]. A recent theorem of Aschenbrenner and Hillar states that the module R is Noetherian. We prove that submodules of R can have any number of minimal generators.
