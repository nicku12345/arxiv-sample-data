The main theorem (2.2) consists in two characterizations of isomorphisms of factorial domains in terms of prime or primary rings elements, and unramified, flat or weakly injective affine schemes morphisms. In order to apply this theorem to the famous Jacobian Conjecture, we first introduce its different versions in any characteristic (3.1), and give two reformulations of some these versions in terms of domains of positive characteristic (3.8) and finite prime fields (3.9). Finally, we deduce from the main theorem an original reformulation of the any characteristic version of the Jacobian Conjecture in terms of prime or primary rings elements (3.11).
