Let I be an ideal of the polynomial ring A[x]=A[x_1,...,x_n] over the commutative, noetherian ring A. Geometrically I defines a family of affine schemes over \Spec(A): For \p\in\Spec(A), the fibre over \p is the closed subscheme of affine space over the residue field k(\p), which is determined by the extension of I under the canonical map \sigma_\p:A[x]\to k(\p)[x]. If I is homogeneous there is an analogous projective setting, but again the ideal defining the fibre is \sigI. For a chosen term order this ideal has a unique reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis which is known to contain considerable geometric information about the fibre. We study the behavior of this basis for varying \p and prove the existence of a canonical decomposition of the base space \Spec(A) into finitely many locally closed subsets over which the reduced Gr\"{o}bner bases of the fibres can be parametrized in a suitable way.
