Let G= {\rm Spec} A be an affine R-monoid scheme. We prove that the category of dual functors (over the category of commutative R-algebras) of G-modules is equivalent to the category of dual functors of {\mathcal A}^*-modules. We prove that G is invariant exact if and only if A^*= R \times B^* as R-algebras and the first projection A^* \to R is the unit of A. If \mathbb M is a dual functor of G-modules and w_G := (1,0) \in R \times B^* = A^*, we prove that \mathbb M^G = w_G \cdot \mathbb M and \mathbb F = w_G \cdot \mathbb M \oplus (1-w_G) \cdot \mathbb M; hence, the Reynolds operator can defined on \mathcal M.
