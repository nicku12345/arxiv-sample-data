In this paper we study properties of hyperholomorphic functions on commutative finite algebras. It is investigated the Cauchy-Riemann type conditions for hyperholomorphic functions. We prove that a hyperholomorphic function on a commutative finite algebra can be expanded in a Taylor series. We also present a technique for computing zeros of polynomials in some commutative algebras.
