In this manuscript we shall give an explicit formula for the jumping numbers of a simple complete ideal in a two-dimensional regular local ring. In particular, we obtain a formula for the jumping numbers of an analytically irreducible plane curve. We then show that the jumping numbers determine the equisingularity class of the curve.
