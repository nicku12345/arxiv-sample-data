We show that in certain Pr\"ufer domains, each nonzero ideal I can be factored as I=I^v \Pi, where I^v is the divisorial closure of I and \Pi is a product of maximal ideals. This is always possible when the Pr\"ufer domain is h-local, and in this case such factorizations have certain uniqueness properties. This leads to new characterizations of the h-local property in Pr\"ufer domains. We also explore consequences of these factorizations and give illustrative examples.
