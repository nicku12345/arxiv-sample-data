We explore the geometric notion of prolongations in the setting of computational algebra, extending results of Landsberg and Manivel which relate prolongations to equations for secant varieties. We also develop methods for computing prolongations which are combinatorial in nature. As an application, we use prolongations to derive a new family of secant equations for the binary symmetric model in phylogenetics.
