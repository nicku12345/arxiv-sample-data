In this note we study standard and good determinantal schemes. We show that there exist arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay schemes that are not standard determinantal, and whose general hyperplane section is good determinantal. We prove that if a general hyperplane section of a scheme is standard (resp. good) determinantal, then the scheme is standard (resp. good) determinantal up to flat deformation. We also study the transfer of the property of being standard or good determinantal under basic double links.
