In this paper we introduce several computational techniques for the study of moduli spaces of McKay quiver representations, making use of Groebner bases and toric geometry. For a finite abelian group G in GL(n,k), let Y_\theta be the coherent component of the moduli space of \theta-stable representations of the McKay quiver. Our two main results are as follows: we provide a simple description of the quiver representations corresponding to the torus orbits of Y_\theta, and, in the case where Y_\theta equals Nakamura's G-Hilbert scheme, we present explicit equations for a cover by local coordinate charts. The latter theorem corrects the first result from [Nakamura]. The techniques introduced here allow experimentation in this subject and give concrete algorithmic tools to tackle further open questions. To illustrate this point, we present an example of a nonnormal G-Hilbert scheme, thereby answering a question raised by Nakamura.
