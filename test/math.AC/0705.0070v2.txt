We prove that the Cox ring of \bar{M}_{0,6}, the moduli space of stable, rational curves with 6 marked points, is finitely generated by sections corresponding to the boundary divisors and divisors which are pull-backs of the hyperelliptic locus in \bar{M}_3, the moduli space of stable, genus 3 curves, via morphisms that send a 6-pointed rational curve to a curve with 3 nodes by identifying 3 pairs of points. In particular, this gives a self-contained proof of Hassett and Tschinkel's result about the effective cone of \bar{M}_{0,6} being generated by the above mentioned divisors.
