We consider the moduli space \cSU_C^s(r,\cO_C) of rank r stable vector bundles with trivial determinant on a smooth projective curve C of genus g. We show that the Abel-Jacobi map on the rational Chow group CH_1(\cSU_C^s(r,\cO_C))_{hom}\otimes \Q of one cycles which are homologous to zero, is an isomorphism onto the bottom weight intermediate Jacobian, which is identified with the Jacobian Jac(C)\otimes \Q. The result holds whenever r\geq 2 and g\geq 4.
