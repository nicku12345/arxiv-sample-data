A functor of sets \mathbb X over the category of K-commutative algebras is said to be an affine functor if its functor of functions, \mathbb A_{\mathbb X}, is reflexive and \mathbb X=\Spec \mathbb A_{\mathbb X}. We prove that affine functors are equal to a direct limit of affine schemes and that affine schemes, formal schemes, the completion of affine schemes along a closed subscheme, etc., are affine functors.   Endowing an affine functor \mathbb X with a functor of monoids structure is equivalent to endowing \mathbb A_{\mathbb X} with a functor of bialgebras structure. If \mathbb G is an affine functor of monoids, then \mathbb A_{\mathbb G}^* is the enveloping functor of algebras of \mathbb G and the category of \mathbb G-modules is equivalent to the category of \mathbb A_{\mathbb G}^*-modules. Applications of these results include Cartier duality, neutral Tannakian duality for affine group schemes, the equivalence between formal groups and Lie algebras in characteristic zero, etc.
