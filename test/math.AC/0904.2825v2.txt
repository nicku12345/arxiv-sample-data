We study the notion of \Gamma-graded commutative algebra for an arbitrary abelian group \Gamma. The main examples are the Clifford algebras already treated by Albuquerque and Majid. We prove that the Clifford algebras are the only simple finite-dimensional associative graded commutative algebras over \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C}. Our approach also leads to non-associative graded commutative algebras extending the Clifford algebras.
