In this paper we give general definitions of non-commutative jets in the local and global situation using square zero extensions and derivations. We study the functors Exank(A, I) where A is any k-algebra and I is any left and right A-module and use this to relate affine non-commutative jets to liftings of modules. We also study the Kodaira-Spencer class KS(L) and relate it to the Atiyah class.
