We study functors underlying derived Hochschild cohomology, also called Shukla cohomology, of a commutative algebra S essentially of finite type and of finite flat dimension over a commutative noetherian ring K. We construct a complex of S-modules D, and natural reduction isomorphisms   Ext^*_{S\otimes^L_{K}S}(S|K;M\otimes^L_{K}N) ~ Ext^*_S(RHom_S(M,D),N) for all complexes of S-modules N and all complexes M of finite flat dimension over K whose homology H(M) is finitely generated over S; such isomorphisms determine D up to derived isomorphism. Using Grothendieck duality theory we establish analogous isomorphisms for any essentially finite type flat maps f: X->Y of noetherian schemes, with f^!(O_Y) in place of D.
