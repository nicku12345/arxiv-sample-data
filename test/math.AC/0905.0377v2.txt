Given a list of n cells L=[(p_1,q_1),...,(p_n, q_n)] where p_i, q_i\in \textbf{Z}_{\ge 0}, we let \Delta_L=\det |{(p_j!)^{-1}(q_j!)^{-1} x^{p_j}_iy^{q_j}_i} |. The space of diagonally alternating polynomials is spanned by \{\Delta_L\} where L varies among all lists with n cells. For a>0, the operators E_a=\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\partial_{x_i}^a act on diagonally alternating polynomials and Haiman has shown that the space A_n of diagonally alternating harmonic polynomials is spanned by \{E_\lambda\Delta_n\}. For t=(t_m,...,t_1)\in \textbf{Z}_{> 0}^m with t_m>...>t_1>0, we consider here the operator F_t=\det\big\|E_{t_{m-j+1}+(j-i)}\big\|. Our first result is to show that F_t\Delta_L is a linear combination of \Delta_{L'} where L' is obtained by {\sl moving} \ell(t)=m distinct cells from L in some determined fashion. This allows us to control the leading term of some elements of the form F_{t_{(1)}}... F_{t_{(r)}}\Delta_n. We use this to describe explicit bases of some of the bihomogeneous components of A_n=\bigoplus A_n^{k,l} where A_n^{k,l}=\hbox{Span}\{E_\lambda\Delta_n :\ell(\lambda)=l, |\lambda|=k\}. More precisely we give an explicit basis of A_n^{k,l} whenever k<n. To this end, we introduce a new variation of Schensted insertion on a special class of tableaux. This produces a bijection between partitions and this new class of tableaux. The combinatorics of those tableaux T allows us to know exactly the leading term of F_T\Delta_n where F_T is the operator corresponding to the columns of T and whenever n is bigger than the weight of T.
