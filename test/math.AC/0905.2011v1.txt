For any smooth projective variety X of dimension n over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0 with \mu(\Omega^1_X)>0. If {\rm T}^{\ell}(\Omega^1_X) (0<\ell<n(p-1)) are semi-stable, then the sheaf B^1_X of exact 1-forms is stable. When X is a surface with \mu(\Omega^1_X)>0 and \Omega^1_X is semi-stable, the sheaf B^2_X of exact 2-forms is also stable. Moreover, under the same condition, the sheaf Z^1_X of closed 1-forms is stable when p>3, and Z^1_X is semi-stable when p=3.
