Let d \in \N and let \D^d denote the class of all pairs (R,M) in which R = \bigoplus_{n \in \N_0} R_n is a Noetherian homogeneous ring with Artinian base ring R_0 and such that M is a finitely generated graded R-module of dimension \leq d.   The cohomology table of a pair (R,M) \in \D^d is defined as the family of non-negative integers d_M:= (d^i_M(n))_{(i,n) \in \N \times \Z}. We say that a subclass \mathcal{C} of \D^d is of finite cohomology if the set \{d_M \mid (R,M) \in \C\} is finite. A set \mathbb{S} \subseteq \{0,... ,d-1\}\times \Z is said to bound cohomology, if for each family (h^\sigma)_{\sigma \in \mathbb{S}} of non-negative integers, the class \{(R,M) \in \D^d\mid d^i_M(n) \leq h^{(i,n)} {for all} (i,n) \in \mathbb{S}\} is of finite cohomology. Our main result says that this is the case if and only if \mathbb{S} contains a quasi diagonal, that is a set of the form \{(i,n_i)| i=0,..., d-1\} with integers n_0> n_1 > ... > n_{d-1}. We draw a number of conclusions of this boundedness criterion.
