We construct, in this paper, a generalization of the Dennis trace (for matrices) to the case of the supermatrices over an arbitrary (not necessarily commutative) superalgebra with unit. By analogy with the ungraded case, we show how it is possible to use this map to construct an isomorphism from the Hochschild homology of the superalgebra to the Hochschild homology of the supermatrix algebra.
