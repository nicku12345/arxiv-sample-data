We prove a new restriction theorem for semistable sheaves on varieties in all characteristics strengthening previous results. We also prove restriction theorem for strong semistability for varieties with some non-negativity constrains on the cotangent bundle (e.g., most of Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties).
