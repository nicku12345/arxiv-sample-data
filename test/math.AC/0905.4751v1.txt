Let I_n be the ideal of all algebraic relations on the slopes of the \binom{n}{2} lines formed by placing n points in a plane and connecting each pair of points with a line. Under each of two natural term orders, the initial ideal of I_n is generated by monomials corresponding to permutations satisfying a certain pattern-avoidance condition. We show bijectively that these permutations are enumerated by the updown (or Euler) numbers, thereby obtaining a formula for the number of generators of the initial ideal of I_n in each degree.
