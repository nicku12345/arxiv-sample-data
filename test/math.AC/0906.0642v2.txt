In continuation of [1] we study associated primes of Matlis duals of local cohomology modules (MDLCM). We combine ideas from Helmut Z\"oschinger on coassociated primes of arbitrary modules with results from [1], [4], [5], [6] and obtain partial answers to questions which were left open in [1]. These partial answers give further support for conjecture (*) from [1] on the set of associated primes of MDLCMs. In addition, and also inspired by ideas from Z\"oschinger, we prove some non-finiteness results of local cohomology.
