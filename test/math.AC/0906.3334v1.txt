In this survey article we outline the history of the twin theories of weak normality and seminormality for commutative rings and algebraic varieties with an emphasis on the recent developments in these theories over the past fifteen years. We develop the theories for general commutative rings, but specialize to reduced Noetherian rings when necessary. We hope to acquaint the reader with many of the consequences of the theories.
