Suppose that X = \Spec R is an F-finite normal variety in characteristic p > 0. In this paper we show that the big test ideal \tau_b(R) = \tld \tau(R) is equal to \sum_{\Delta} \tau(R; \Delta) where the sum is over \Delta such that K_X + \Delta is \bQ-Cartier. This affirmatively answers a question asked by various people, including Blickle, Lazarsfeld, K. Lee and K. Smith. Furthermore, we have a version of this result in the case that R is not even necessarily normal.
