Given a significative class F of commutative rings, we study the precise conditions under which a commutative ring R has an F-envelope. A full answer is obtained when F is the class of fields, semisimple commutative rings or integral domains. When F is the class of Noetherian rings, we give a full answer when the Krull dimension of R is zero and when the envelope is required to be epimorphic. The general problem is reduced to identifying the class of non-Noetherian rings having a monomorphic Noetherian envelope, which we conjecture is the empty class.
