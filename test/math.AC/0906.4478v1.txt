Given a symbolic power of a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring, we study the problem of determining which powers of the ideal contain it. For ideals defining 0-dimensional subschemes of projective space, as an immediate corollary of our previous paper (arXiv:0706.3707) we give a complete solution in terms of the least degrees of nonzero elements of the symbolic powers, under the condition that the ideal is generated in a single degree and such that that degree is the regularity of the ideal (see Corollary 1.2). Using geometric methods, we also give complete solutions for ideals of points in the projective plane, when those points lie on an irreducible conic or when the points are general and there are at most 9 points. Finally, we give new examples of ideals all of whose symbolic powers are ordinary powers of the ideal.
