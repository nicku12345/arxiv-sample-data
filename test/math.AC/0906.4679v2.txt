We prove that the F-jumping numbers of the test ideal \tau(X; \Delta, \ba^t) are discrete and rational under the assumptions that X is a normal and F-finite variety over a field of positive characteristic p, K_X+\Delta is \bQ-Cartier of index not divisible p, and either X is essentially of finite type over a field or the sheaf of ideals \ba is locally principal. This is the largest generality for which discreteness and rationality are known for the jumping numbers of multiplier ideals in characteristic zero.
