Work of Dolgachev and Castravet-Tevelev establishes a bijection between the 2^{n-1} weights of the half-spin representations of \mathfrak{so}_{2n} and the generators of the Cox ring of the variety X_n which is obtained by blowing up \mathbb{P}^{n-3} at n points. We derive a geometric explanation for this bijection, by embedding {\rm Cox}(X_n) into the even spinor variety (the homogeneous space of the even half-spin representation). The Cox ring of the blow-up X_n is recovered geometrically by intersecting torus translates of the even spinor variety. These are higher-dimensional generalizations of results by Derenthal and Serganova-Skorobogatov on del Pezzo surfaces.
