We prove that the defining ideal of a sufficiently high Veronese subring of a toric algebra admits a quadratic Gr\"obner basis consisting of binomials. More generally, we prove that the defining ideal of a sufficiently high Veronese subring of a standard graded ring admits a quadratic Gr\"obner basis. We give a lower bound on d such that the defining ideal of d-th Veronese subring admits a quadratic Gr\"obner basis. Eisenbud--Reeves--Totaro stated the same theorem without a proof with some lower bound on d. In many cases, our lower bound is less than Eisenbud--Reeves--Totaro's lower bound.
