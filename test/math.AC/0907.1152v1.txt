A class of determinants is introduced. Different kind of mathematical objects, such as Fibonacci, Lucas, Tchebychev, Hermite, Laguerre, Legendre polynomials, sums and covergents are represented as determinants from this class. A closed formula in which arbitrary term of a homogenous linear recurrence equation is expressed in terms of the initial conditions and the coefficients is proved.
