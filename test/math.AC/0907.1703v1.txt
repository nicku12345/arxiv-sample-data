We show that given any polynomial ring R over a field, and any ideal J in R which is generated by three cubic forms, the projective dimension of R/J is at most 36. We also settle the question whether ideals generated by three cubic forms can have projective dimension greater than 4, by constructing one with projective dimension equal to 5.
