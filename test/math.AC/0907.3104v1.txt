This paper is a continuation of the paper Int. Electron. J. Algebra 6 (2009), 219-227. Namely, we introduce and study a doubly filtered set of classes of rings of finite Gorenstein global dimension, which are called (n,m)-SG for integers n\geq 1 and m\geq 0. Examples of (n,m)-SG rings, for n=1 and 2 and every m\geq 0, are given.
