We discuss a paper of M. Green from a new algebraic perspective, and provide applications of its results to level and Gorenstein algebras, concerning their Hilbert functions and the weak Lefschetz property. In particular, we will determine a new infinite class of symmetric h-vectors that cannot be Gorenstein h-vectors, which was left open in a recent work of Migliore-Nagel-Zanello. This includes the smallest example previously unknown, h=(1,10,9,10,1). As M. Green's results depend heavily on the characteristic of the base field, so will ours. The appendix will contain a new argument, kindly provided to us by M. Green, for Theorems 3 and 4 of his paper, since we had found a gap in the original proof of those results during the preparation of this manuscript.
