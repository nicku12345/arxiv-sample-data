A finitely generated commutative monoid is uniquely presented if it has only a minimal presentation. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for finitely generated, combinatorially finite, cancellative, commutative monoids to be uniquely presented. We use the concept of gluing to construct commutative monoids with this property. Finally for some relevant families of numerical semigroups we describe the elements that are uniquely presented.
