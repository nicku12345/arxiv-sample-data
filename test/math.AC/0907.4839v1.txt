Let G be a chordal graph and I(G) its edge ideal. Let \beta (I(G)) = (\beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_p) denote the Betti sequence of I(G), where \beta_i stands for the ith total Betti number of I(G) and where p is the projective dimension of I(G). It will be shown that there exists a simplicial complex \Delta of dimension p whose f-vector f (\Delta) = (f_0, f_1, ..., f_p) coincides with \beta (I(G)).
