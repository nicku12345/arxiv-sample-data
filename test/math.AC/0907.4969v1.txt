We investigate Tate cohomology of modules over a commutative noetherian ring with respect to semidualizing modules. We identify classes of modules admitting Tate resolutions and analyze the interaction between the corresponding relative and Tate cohomology modules. As an application of our approach, we prove a general balance result for Tate cohomology. Our results are based on an analysis of Tate cohomology in abelian categories.
