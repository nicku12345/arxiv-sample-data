The aim of this paper is to introduce a new class of Noetherian rings of positive characteristic in terms of perfect closures and study their basic properties. If the perfect closure of a Noetherian ring is coherent, we call it an F-coherent ring. Some interesting applications are given in connection with tight closure theory. In particular, we discuss relationships between F-coherent rings and F-pure, F-regular, and F-injective rings. The final section discusses how the coherent property effects the behavior of tight closure for general perfect rings.
