We obtain the following characterization of Q-polynomial distance-regular graphs. Let \G denote a distance-regular graph with diameter d\ge 3. Let E denote a minimal idempotent of \G which is not the trivial idempotent E_0. Let \{\theta_i^*\}_{i=0}^d denote the dual eigenvalue sequence for E. We show that E is Q-polynomial if and only if (i) the entry-wise product E \circ E is a linear combination of E_0, E, and at most one other minimal idempotent of \G; (ii) there exists a complex scalar \beta such that \theta^*_{i-1}-\beta \theta^*_i + \theta^*_{i+1} is independent of i for 1 \le i \le d-1; (iii) \theta^*_i \ne \theta^*_0 for 1 \le i \le d.
