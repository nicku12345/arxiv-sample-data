Let \bar{\Kset}_f denote the commutative unital ring of Colombeau's full generalized numbers. This ring can be endowed with an ultra-metric in such a way that it becomes a topological ring. There are many interesting question about \bar{\Kset}_f in the framework of Commutative Algebra and General Topology as well as of the superposition of these two subjects. The purpose of this paper aims to give an initial step toward the study of this ring.
