The purpose of this note is to survey a methodology to solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities. The techniques we discuss use the algebra of multivariate polynomials with coefficients over a field to create large-scale linear algebra or semidefinite programming relaxations of many kinds of feasibility or optimization questions. We are particularly interested in problems arising in combinatorial optimization.
