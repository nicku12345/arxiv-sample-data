We show that the algebraic invariants multiplicity and depth of a graded ideal in the polynomial ring are closely connected to the fan structure of its generic tropical variety in the constant coefficient case. Generically the multiplicity of the ideal is shown to correspond directly to a natural definition of multiplicity of cones of tropical varieties. Moreover, we can recover information on the depth of the ideal from the fan structure of the generic tropical variety if the depth is known to be greater than 0. In particular, in this case we can see if the ideal is Cohen-Macaulay or almost-Cohen-Macaulay from its generic tropical variety.
