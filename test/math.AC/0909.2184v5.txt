Let p(t) be an admissible Hilbert polynomial in \PP^n of degree d. The Hilbert scheme \hilb^n_p(t) can be realized as a closed subscheme of a suitable Grassmannian  \mathbb G, hence it could be globally defined by homogeneous equations in the Plucker coordinates of  \mathbb G and covered by open subsets given by the non-vanishing of a Plucker coordinate, each embedded as a closed subscheme of the affine space A^D, D=\dim(\mathbb G). However, the number E of Plucker coordinates is so large that effective computations in this setting are practically impossible. In this paper, taking advantage of the symmetries of \hilb^n_p(t), we exhibit a new open cover, consisting of marked schemes over Borel-fixed ideals, whose number is significantly smaller than E. Exploiting the properties of marked schemes, we prove that these open subsets are defined by equations of degree \leq d+2 in their natural embedding in \Af^D. Furthermore we find new embeddings in affine spaces of far lower dimension than D, and characterize those that are still defined by equations of degree \leq d+2. The proofs are constructive and use a polynomial reduction process, similar to the one for Grobner bases, but are term order free. In this new setting, we can achieve explicit computations in many non-trivial cases.
