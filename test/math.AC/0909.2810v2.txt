In this paper we discuss the relationship between the moving planes of a rational parametric surface and the singular points on it. Firstly, the intersection multiplicity of several planar curves is introduced. Then we derive an equivalent definition for the order of a singular point on a rational parametric surface. Based on the new definition of singularity orders, we derive the relationship between the moving planes of a rational surface and the order of singular points. Especially, the relationship between the \mu-basis and the order of a singular point is also discussed.
