It is a longstanding problem in Algebraic Geometry to determine whether the syzygy bundle E_{d_1,...,d_n} on \mathbb{P}^N defined as the kernel of a general epimorphism \[\phi:\mathcal{O}(-d_1)\oplus...\oplus\mathcal{O}(-d_n) \to\mathcal{O}\] is (semi)stable. In this thesis, attention is restricted to the case of syzygy bundles \mathrm{Syz}(f_1,...,f_n) on \mathbb{P}^N associated to n generic forms f_1,...,f_n\in K[X_0,...,X_N] of the same degree d, for {N\ge2}.   The first goal is to prove that \mathrm{Syz}(f_1,...,f_n) is stable if \[N+1\le n\le\tbinom{d+N}{N},\] except for the case {(N,n,d)=(2,5,2)}. The second is to study moduli spaces of stable rank {n-1} vector bundles on \mathbb{P}^N containing syzygy bundles. In a joint work with Laura Costa and Rosa Mar{\'\i}a Mir\'o-Roig, we prove that N, d and n are as above, then the syzygy bundle \mathrm{Syz}(f_1,...,f_n) is unobstructed and it belongs to a generically smooth irreducible component of dimension {n\tbinom{d+N}{N}-n^2}, if {N\ge3}, and {n\tbinom{d+2}{2}+n\tbinom{d-1}{2}-n^2}, if {N=2}.   The results in chapter 3, for N\ge3, were obtained independently by Iustin Coand\u{a} in arXiv:0909.4435.
