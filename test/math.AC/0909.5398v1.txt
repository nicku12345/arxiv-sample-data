Let E denote a general complex binary form of order d (seen as a point in \P^d), and let \Omega_E \subseteq \P^d denote the closure of its SL_2-orbit. In this note, we calculate the equivariant minimal generators of its defining ideal I_E \subseteq \complex[a_0,...,a_d] for 4 \leqslant d \leqslant 10. In order to effect the calculation, we introduce a notion called the `graded threshold character' of d. One unexpected feature of the problem is the (rare) occurrence of the so-called `invisible' generators in the ideal, and the resulting dichotomy on the set of integers d \geqslant 4.
