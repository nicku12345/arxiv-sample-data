In this paper we give different compactifications for the domain and the codomain of an affine rational map f which parametrizes a hypersurface. We show that the closure of the image of this map (with possibly some other extra hypersurfaces) can be represented by a matrix of linear syzygies. We compactify \Bbb {A}^{n-1} into an (n-1)-dimensional projective arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay subscheme of some \Bbb {P}^N. One particular interesting compactification of \Bbb {A}^{n-1} is the toric variety associated to the Newton polytope of the polynomials defining f. We consider two different compactifications for the codomain of f: \Bbb {P}^n and (\Bbb {P}^1)^n. In both cases we give sufficient conditions, in terms of the nature of the base locus of the map, for getting a matrix representation of its closed image, without involving extra hypersurfaces. This constitutes a direct generalization of the corresponding results established in [BuseJouanolou03], [BuseChardinJouanolou06], [BuseDohm07], [BotbolDickensteinDohm09] and [Botbol09].
