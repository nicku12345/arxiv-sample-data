We study several classes of isolated singularities of plurisubharmonic functions that can be approximated by analytic singularities with control over their residual Monge--Amp\`ere masses. They are characterized in terms of Green functions for Demailly's approximations, relative types, and valuations. Furthermore, the classes are shown to appear when studying graded families of ideals of analytic functions and the corresponding asymptotic multiplier ideals.
