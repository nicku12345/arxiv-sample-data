In this paper we examine on a pair of adjoint functors (\phi ^{\ast},\phi_{\ast}) for a subcategory of the category of crossed modules over commutative algebras where \phi ^{\ast}:\mathbf{XMod}\textbf{/}% Q\rightarrow  \mathbf{XMod/}P, pullback, which enables us to move from crossed Q-modules to crossed P-modules by an algebra morphism \phi :P\rightarrow Q and \phi_{\ast}:\mathbf{XMod}\textbf{/}P\rightarrow  \mathbf{XMod/}Q, induced. We note that this adjoint functor pair (\phi ^{\ast},\phi_{\ast}) makes p:\mathbf{XMod}\rightarrow  k\textbf{-Alg}into a bifibred category over k\textbf{-Alg}, the category of commutative algebras, where p is given by p(C,R,\partial)=R.   Also, some examples and results on induced crossed modules are given.
