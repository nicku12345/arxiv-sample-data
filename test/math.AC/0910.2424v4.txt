We prove that every projective embedding of a connected scheme determined by the complete linear series of a sufficiently ample line bundle is defined by the 2-minors of a 1-generic matrix of linear forms. Extending the work of Eisenbud-Koh-Stillman for integral curves, we also provide effective descriptions for such determinantally presented ample line bundles on products of projective spaces, Gorenstein toric varieties, and smooth n-folds.
