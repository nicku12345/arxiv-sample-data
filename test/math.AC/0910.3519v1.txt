In a recent paper it has been established that over an Artinian ring R all two-dimensional polynomial automorphisms having Jacobian determinant one are tame if R is a Q-algebra. This is a generalization of the famous Jung-Van der Kulk Theorem, which deals with the case that R is a field (of any characteristic). Here we will show that for tameness over an Artinian ring, the Q-algebra assumption is really needed: we will give, for local Artinian rings with square-zero principal maximal ideal, a complete description of the tame automorphism subgroup. This will lead to an example of a non-tame automorphism, for any characteristic p>0.
