We extend the theory of Littlewood-Richardson fillings (defined over the non-negative integers) to include diagrams with rows and boxes of real-valued length. We realize such fillings as invariants of matrix pairs over rings with a real-valued valuation. We then prove a bijection between pairs of fillings determined by a matrix pair, and connect this to the classical row-switching bijection for Littlewoo-Richardson fillings. We utilize matrix calculations to interpret continuous deformations of generalized Littlewood-Richardson fillings.
