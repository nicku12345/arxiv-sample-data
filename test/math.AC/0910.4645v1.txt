Let K be a field and S=K[x_1,...,x_n]. In 1982, Stanley defined what is now called the Stanley depth of an S-module M, denoted \sdepth(M), and conjectured that \depth(M) \le \sdepth(M) for all finitely generated S-modules M. This conjecture remains open for most cases. However, Herzog, Vladoiu and Zheng recently proposed a method of attack in the case when M = I / J with J \subset I being monomial S-ideals. Specifically, their method associates M with a partially ordered set. In this paper we take advantage of this association by using combinatorial tools to analyze squarefree Veronese ideals in S. In particular, if I_{n,d} is the squarefree Veronese ideal generated by all squarefree monomials of degree d, we show that if 1\le d\le n < 5d+4, then \sdepth(I_{n,d})= \floor{\binom{n}{d+1}\Big/\binom{n}{d}}+d, and if d\geq 1 and n\ge 5d+4, then d+3\le \sdepth(I_{n,d}) \le \floor{\binom{n}{d+1}\Big/\binom{n}{d}}+d.
