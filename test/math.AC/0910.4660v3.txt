Let X be a finite type simply connected rationally elliptic CW-complex with Sullivan minimal model (\Lambda V, d) and let k\geq 2 the biggest integer such that d=\sum_{i\geq k}d_i with d_i(V)\subseteq \Lambda ^iV. We show that: cat(X_{\mathbb{Q}}) = depht(\Lambda V, d_k) if and only if (\Lambda V,d_{k}) is elliptic. This result is obtained by introducing tow new spectral sequences that generalize the Milnor-Moore spectral sequence and its \mathcal{E}xt-version \cite{Mur94}. As a corollary, we recover a known result proved - with different methods - by L. Lechuga and A. Murillo in \cite{LM02} and G. Lupton in \cite{Lup02}: If (\Lambda V,d_{k}) is elliptic, then cat(X_{\mathbb{Q}}) = dim(\pi_{odd}(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}) + (k-2)dim(\pi_{even}(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}). In the case of a field {IK} of char({IK})=p (an odd prim) we obtain an algebraic approach for e_{IK}(X) where X is an r-connected (r\geq 1) finite CW-complex such that p> dim(X)/r.
