Let \F be an algebraically closed field. Let \V be a vector space equipped with a non-degenerate symmetric or symplectic bilinear form B over \F. Suppose the characteristic of \F is \emph{large}, i.e. either zero or greater than the dimension of \V. Let I(\V, B) denote the group of isometries. Using the Jacobson-Morozov lemma we give a new and simple proof of the fact that two elements in I(\V,B) are conjugate if and only if they have the same elementary divisors.
