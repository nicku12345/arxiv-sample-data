Schm\"udgen's Theorem says that if a basic closed semialgebraic set K = {g_1 \geq 0, ..., g_s \geq 0} in R^n is compact, then any polynomial f which is strictly positive on K is in the preordering generated by the g_i's. Putinar's Theorem says that under a condition stronger than compactness, any f which is strictly positive on K is in the quadratic module generated by the g_i's. In this note we show that if the g_i's and the f have rational coefficients, then there is a representation of f in the preordering with sums of squares of polynomials over Q. We show that the same is true for Putinar's Theorem as long as we include among the generators a polynomial N - \sum X_i^2, N a natural number.
