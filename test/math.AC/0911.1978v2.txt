We introduce a conjecture about constructing critically (s+1)-chromatic graphs from critically s-chromatic graphs. We then show how this conjecture implies that any unmixed height two square-free monomial ideal I, i.e., the cover ideal of a finite simple graph, has the persistence property, that is, Ass(R/I^s) \subseteq Ass(R/I^{s+1}) for all s >= 1. To support our conjecture, we prove that the statement is true if we also assume that \chi_f(G), the fractional chromatic number of the graph G, satisfies \chi(G) -1 < \chi_f(G) <= \chi(G). We give an algebraic proof of this result.
