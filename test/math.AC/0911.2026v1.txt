Let G be a simple undirected graph on n vertices. Francisco and Van Tuyl have shown that if G is chordal, then \bigcap_{\{x_i,x_j\}\in E_G} < x_i,x_j> is componentwise linear. A natural question that arises is for which t_{ij}>1 the ideal \bigcap_{\{x_i,x_j\}\in E_G}< x_i, x_j>^{t_{ij}} is componentwise linear, if G is chordal. In this report we show that \bigcap_{\{x_i,x_j\}\in E_G} < x_i, x_j>^{t} is componentwise linear for all n\geq 3 and positive t, if G is a complete graph. We give also an example where G is chordal, but the intersection ideal is not componentwise linear for any t>1.
