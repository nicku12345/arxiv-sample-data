Let k be an arbitrary field of characteristic zero, k[x, y] be the polynomial ring and D a k-derivation of the ring k[x, y]. Recall that a nonconstant polynomial F\in k[x, y] is said to be a Darboux polynomial of the derivation D if D(F)=\lambda F for some polynomial \lambda \in k[x, y]. We prove that any two linearly independent over the field k commuting k-derivations D_{1} and D_{2} of the ring k[x, y] either have a common Darboux polynomial, or D_{1}=D_{u_{1}}, D_{2}=D_{u_{2}} are Jacobian derivations i.e., D_{i}(f)=\det J(u_{i}, f) for every f\in k[x, y], i=1, 2, where the polynomials u_{1}, u_{2} satisfy the condition \det J(u_{1}, u_{2})=c\in k^{\star}. This statement about derivations is an analogue of the known fact from   Linear Algebra about common eigenvectors of pairs of commuting linear operators.
