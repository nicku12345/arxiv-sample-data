The so called Pr\"ufer v-multiplication domains (PvMD's) are usually defined as domains whose finitely generated nonzero ideals are t-invertible. These domains generalize Pr\"ufer domains and Krull domains. The PvMD's are relatively obscure compared to their very well known special cases. One of the reasons could be that the study of PvMD's uses the jargon of star operations, such as the v-operation and the t-operation. In this paper, we provide characterizations of and basic results on PvMD's and related notions without star operations.
