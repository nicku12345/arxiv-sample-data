In this article we deduce an analogue of Quillen's Local-Global Principle for the elementary subgroup of the general quadratic group and the hermitian group. We show that the unstable K_1-groups of the hermitian groups are nilpotent by abelian. This generalizes earlier results of A. Bak, R. Hazrat, N. Vavilov and etal..
