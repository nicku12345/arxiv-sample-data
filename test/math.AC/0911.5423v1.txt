In this article, we define a class of binomial ideals associated to a simplicial complex. This class of ideals appears in the presentation of fiber cones of codimension 2 lattice ideals \cite{hm}, and in the work of Barile and Morales \cite{bm2}, \cite{bm3}, \cite{bm4}. We compute the reduction number of Binomial extensions of Simplicial ideals. This extends all the previous results in this area.
