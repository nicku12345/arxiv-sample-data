In this paper, we partially confirm a conjecture, proposed by Cimpoea\c{s}, Keller, Shen, Streib and Young, on the Stanley depth of squarefree Veronese ideals I_{n,d}. This conjecture suggests that, for positive integers 1 \le d \le n, \sdepth (I_{n,d})= \lfloor \binom{n}{d+1}/\binom{n}{d} \rfloor+d. Herzog, Vladoiu and Zheng established a connection between the Stanley depths of quotients of monomial ideals and interval partitions of certain associated posets. Based on this connection, Keller, Shen, Streib and Young recently developed a useful combinatorial tool to analyze the interval partitions of the posets associated with the squarefree Veronese ideals. We modify their ideas and prove that if 1 \le d \le n \le (d+1) \lfloor \frac{1+\sqrt{5+4d}}{2}\rfloor+2d, then \sdepth (I_{n,d})= \lfloor \binom{n}{d+1}/\binom{n}{d} \rfloor+d. We also obtain  \lfloor \frac{d+\sqrt{d^2+4(n+1)}}{2} \rfloor \le \sdepth(I_{n,d}) \le \lfloor \binom{n}{d+1}/\binom{n}{d} \rfloor+d for n > (d+1) \lfloor \frac{1+\sqrt{5+4d}}{2}\rfloor+2d. As a byproduct of our construction, We give an alternative proof of Theorem 1.1  in [13] without graph theory.
