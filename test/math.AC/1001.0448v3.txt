A module M over the tropical semifield T is analogous to a module over a field. We assume that M is straight reflexive, and define the dimension of M to the number of elements of a basis. We study the dimension of a straight reflexive submodule N \subset M. Also we find an enough condition to the reflexivity. This result has an application to polytopes in a tropical projective space, and also to a Riemann-Roch theorem for tropical curves.
