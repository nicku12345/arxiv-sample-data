Let B be a Noetherian normal local ring, and G\subset\Aut(B) a cyclic group of local automorphisms of prime order. Let A be the ring of G-invariants of B, assume that A is Noetherian. We study the invariant morphism; in particular, we prove that B is a monogenous A-algebra if and only if the augmentation ideal of B is principal. If in particular B is regular, we prove that A is regular if the augmentation ideal of B is principal.
