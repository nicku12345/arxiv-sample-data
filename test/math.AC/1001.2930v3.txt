We give an example of a non \Q-Gorenstein variety which is canonical but not klt, and whose canonical divisor has an irrational valuation. We also give an example of an irrational jumping number and we prove that there are no accumulation points for the jumping numbers of normal non-\Q-Gorenstein varieties with isolated singularities.
