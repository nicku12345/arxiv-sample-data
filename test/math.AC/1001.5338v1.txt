Let R be a commutative ring with \Z(R) its set of zero-divisors. In this paper, we study the total graph of R, denoted by \T(\Gamma(R)). It is the (undirected) graph with all elements of R as vertices, and for distinct x, y\in R, the vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if x + y\in\Z(R). We investigate properties of the total graph of R and determine all isomorphism classes of finite commutative rings whose total graph has genus at most one (i.e., a planar or toroidal graph). In addition, it is shown that, given a positive integer g, there are only finitely many finite rings whose total graph has genus g.
