Let R be a commutative ring with identity. We define a graph \Gamma_{\aut}(R) on  R, with vertices elements of R, such that any two distinct vertices x, y are adjacent if and only if there exists \sigma \in \aut such that \sigma(x)=y. The idea is to apply graph theory to study orbit spaces of rings under automorphisms. In this article, we define the notion of a ring of type n for n\geq 0 and characterize all rings of type zero. We also characterize local rings (R,M)  in which either the subset of units (\neq 1 ) is connected or the subset M- \{0\} is connected in \Gamma_{\aut}(R).
