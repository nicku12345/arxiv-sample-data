Let A be a ring equipped with a derivation \delta . We study differential Azumaya A algebras, that is, Azumaya A algebras equipped with a derivation that extends \delta . We calculate the differential automorphism group of the trivial differential algebra, M_{n}(A) with coordinatewise differentiation. We introduce the \delta-flat Grothendieck topology to show that any differential Azumaya A algebra is locally isomorphic to a trivial one and then construct, as in the non-differential setting, the embedding of the differential Brauer group into H^{2}(A_{\delta-pl},G_{m,\delta}) . We conclude by showing that the differential Brauer group coincides with the usual Brauer group in the affine setting.
