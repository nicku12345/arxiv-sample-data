The tangential ramification locus B_{X/Y}^t\subset B_{X/Y} is the subset of points in the ramification locus where the sheaf of relative vector fields T_{X/Y} fails to be locally free. It was conjectured by Zariski and Lipman that if V/k is a variety over a field k of characteristic 0 and B^t_{V/k}= \emptyset, then V/k is smooth (=regular). We prove this conjecture when V/k is a locally complete intersection. We prove also that B_{V/k}^t= \emptyset implies \operatorname {codim}_V B_{V/k}\leq 1  in positive characteristic, if V/k  is the fibre of a flat morphism satisfying generic smoothness.
