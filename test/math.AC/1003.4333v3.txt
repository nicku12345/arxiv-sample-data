We derive transformation rules for test ideals and F-singularities under an arbitrary finite surjective morphism \pi : Y \to X of normal varieties in prime characteristic p > 0. The main technique is to relate homomorphisms F_{*} O_{X} \to O_{X}, such as Frobenius splittings, to homomorphisms F_{*} O_{Y} \to O_{Y}. In the simplest cases, these rules mirror transformation rules for multiplier ideals in characteristic zero. As a corollary, we deduce sufficient conditions which imply that trace is surjective, i.e. Tr_{Y/X}(\pi_{*}O_{Y}) = O_{X}.
