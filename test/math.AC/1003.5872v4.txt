To a dominant morphism X/S \to Y/S of N\oe therian integral S-schemes one has the inclusion C_{X/Y}\subset B_{X/Y} of the critical locus in the branch locus of X/Y. Starting from the notion of locally complete intersection morphisms, we give conditions on the modules of relative differentials \Omega_{X/Y}, \Omega_{X/S}, and \Omega_{Y/S} that imply bounds on the codimensions of  C_{X/Y} and  B_{X/Y}. These bounds generalise to a wider class of morphisms the classical purity results for finite morphisms by Zariski-Nagata-Auslander, and Faltings and Grothendieck, and van der Waerden's purity for birational morphisms.
