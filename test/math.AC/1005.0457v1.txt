Let J be a strongly stable monomial ideal in P=k[X0,...,Xn] and let BSt(J) be the family of all the homogeneous ideals in P such that the set N(J) of all the monomials that do not belong to J is a k-vector basis of the quotient P/I. We show that I belongs to BSt(J) if and only if it is generated by a special set of polynomials G, the J-basis of I, that in some sense generalizes the notions of Grobner and border basis (Theorem 10 and Corollary 12). Though not every J-basis is a Grobner basis with respect to some term ordering (Example 20), we define two Noetherian algorithms of reduction with respect to G, the G*-reduction (Definition 9) and the G**-reduction (Definition 15) and prove that J-bases can be characterized through a Buchberger-like criterion on the G**-reductions of S-polynomials (Theorem 17). Using J-bases, we prove that BSt(J) can be endowed, in a very natural way, of a structure of affine scheme, and that it turns out to be homogeneous with respect to a non-standard grading over the additive group Z^n+1 (Theorem 22).
