Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, and let A be an Artinian Gorenstein local commutative and Noetherian K--algebra, with maximal ideal M. In the present paper we prove a structure theorem describing such kind of K--algebras satisfying M^4=0. We use this result in order to prove that such a K--algebra A has rational Poincar\'e series and it is always smoothable in any embedding dimension, if \dim_K M^2/M^3 \le 4. We also prove that the generic Artinian Gorenstein local K--algebra with socle degree three has rational Poincar\'e series, in spite of the fact that such algebras are not necessarily smoothable.
