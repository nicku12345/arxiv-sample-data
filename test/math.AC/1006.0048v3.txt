Let \mathcal{C} be an abelian category and let \Lambda : \mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C} be an idempotent functor which is not right exact, so that the zeroth left derived functor L_0\Lambda does not necessarily coincide with \Lambda. In this paper we show that, under mild conditions on \Lambda, L_0\Lambda is also idempotent, and the category of L_0\Lambda-complete objects of \mathcal{C} is the smallest exact subcategory of \mathcal{C} containing the \Lambda-complete objects. In the main application, where \Lambda is the I-adic completion functor on a category of modules, this gives us that the category of "L-complete modules," studied by Greenlees-May and Hovey-Strickland, is not an ad hoc construction but is in fact characterized by a universal property. Generalizations are also given to the case of relative derived functors, in the sense of relative homological algebra.
