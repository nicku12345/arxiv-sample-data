The goal of this paper is to produce a formula for the multiplier ideals of monomial space curves in the spirit of Howald's formula for the multiplier ideals of monomial ideals. This is achieved by constructing a toric blowup of affine space in such a way that a log resolution of the monomial curve may be constructed from this toric variety in a well controlled manner.
