We fix the lexicographic order \prec on the polynomial ring S=k[x_{1},...,x_{n}] over a ring k. We define \Hi^{\prec\Delta}_{S/k}, the moduli space of reduced Gr\"obner bases with a given finite standard set \Delta, and its open subscheme \Hi^{\prec\Delta,\et}_{S/k}, the moduli space of families of #\Delta points whose attached ideal has the standard set \Delta. We determine the number of irreducible and connected components of the latter scheme; we show that it is equidimensional over {\rm Spec}\,k; and we determine its relative dimension over {\rm Spec} k. We show that analogous statements do not hold for the scheme \Hi^{\prec\Delta}_{S/k}. Our results prove a version of a conjecture by Bernd Sturmfels.
