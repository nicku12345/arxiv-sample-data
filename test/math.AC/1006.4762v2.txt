Given a linear action of a group G on a K-vector space V, we consider the invariant ring K[V \oplus V^*]^G, where V^* is the dual space. We are particularly interested in the case where V =\gfq^n and G is the group U_n of all upper unipotent matrices or the group B_n of all upper triangular matrices in \GL_n(\gfq). In fact, we determine \gfq[V \oplus V^*]^G for G = U_n and G =B_n. The result is a complete intersection for all values of n and q. We present explicit lists of generating invariants and their relations. This makes an addition to the rather short list of "doubly parametrized" series of group actions whose invariant rings are known to have a uniform description.
