In this paper we discuss a general framework in which we present a new conjecture, due to Wenhua Zhao, the Image Conjecture. This conjecture implies the Generalized Vanishing Conjecture and hence the Jacobian Conjecture.   Crucial ingredient is the notion of a Mathieu space: let k be a field and R a commutative k-algebra. A k-linear subspace M of R is called a Mathieu subspace of R, if the following holds: let f\in R be such that f^m\in M, for all m\geq 1, then for every g\in R also gf^m\in M, for almost all m, i.e. only finitely many exceptions.   Let A be the polynomial ring in \zeta=\zeta_1, ...,\zeta_n and z_1, ...,z_n over \mathbb C. The Image Conjecture (IC) asserts that \sum_i(\partial_{z_i}-\zeta_i)A is a Mathieu subspace of A. We prove this conjecture for n=1. Also we relate (IC) to the following Integral Conjecture: if B is an open subset of \mathbb R^n and \sigma a positive measure, such that the integral over B of each polynomial in z over \mathbb C is finite, then the set of polynomials, whose integral over B is zero, is a Mathieu subspace of \mathbb C[z]. It turns out that Laguerre polynomials play a special role in the study of the Jacobian Conjecture.
