Let \mathscr{I} be an ideal sheaf on P^n. In the first part of this paper, we bound the asymptotic regularity of powers of \mathscr{I} as ps-3\leq \reg \mathscr{I}^p\leq ps+e, where e is a constant and s is the s-invariant of \mathscr{I}. We also give the same upper bound for the asymptotic regularity of symbolic powers of \mathscr{I} under some conditions. In the second part, by using multiplier ideal sheaves, we give a vanishing theorem of powers of \mathscr{I} when it defines a local complete intersection subvariety with log canonical singularities.
