The purpose of this paper is to describe several applications of finiteness properties of F-finite F-modules recently discovered by M. Hochster to the study of Frobenius maps on injective hulls, Frobenius near-splittings and to the nature of morphisms of F-finite F-modules.   Among the results in the paper we show that morphisms of F-finite F-modules have a particularly simple form, and we show that certain Frobenius near-splittings have finitely many compatible submodules, thus generalizing a result of M. Blickle and G. B\"ockle to the non-F-finite case.
