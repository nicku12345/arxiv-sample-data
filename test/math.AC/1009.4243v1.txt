We study the dependence of graded Betti numbers of monomial ideals on the characteristic of the base field. The examples we describe include bipartite ideals, Stanley--Reisner ideals of vertex-decomposable complexes and ideals with componentwise linear resolutions. We give a description of bipartite graphs and, using discrete Morse theory, provide a way of looking at the homology of arbitrary simplicial complexes through bipartite ideals. We also prove that the Betti table of a monomial ideal over the field of rational numbers can be obtained from the Betti table over any field by a sequence of consecutive cancellations.
