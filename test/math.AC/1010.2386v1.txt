Under an explicit positivity condition, we show the first secant variety of a linearly normal smooth variety is projectively normal, give results on the regularity of the ideal of the secant variety, and give conditions on the variety that are equivalent to the secant variety being arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. Under this same condition, we then show that if X satisfies N_{p+2\dim(X)}, then the secant variety satisfies N_{3,p}.
