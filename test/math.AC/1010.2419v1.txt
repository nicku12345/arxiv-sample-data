We describe non-trivial \delta-derivations of semisimple finite-dimensional Jordan algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2, and of simple finite-dimensional Jordan superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. For these classes of algebras and superalgebras, non-zero \delta-derivations are shown to be missing for \delta\neq 0,{1}{2},1, and we give a complete account of {1}{2}-derivations.
