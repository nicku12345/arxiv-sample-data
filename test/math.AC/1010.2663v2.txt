Boij-S\"oderberg theory is the study of two cones: the cone of cohomology tables of coherent sheaves over projective space and the cone of standard graded minimal free resolutions over a polynomial ring. Each cone has a simplicial fan structure induced by a partial order on its extremal rays. We provide a new interpretation of these partial orders in terms of the existence of nonzero homomorphisms, for both the general and the equivariant constructions. These results provide new insights into the families of sheaves and modules at the heart of Boij-S\"oderberg theory: supernatural sheaves and Cohen-Macaulay modules with pure resolutions. In addition, our results strongly suggest the naturality of these partial orders, and they provide tools for extending Boij-S\"oderberg theory to other graded rings and projective varieties.
