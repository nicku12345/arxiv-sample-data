By a theorem of Chevalley the image of a morphism of varieties is a constructible set. The algebraic version of this fact is usually stated as a result on "extension of specializations" or "lifting of prime ideals". We present a difference analog of this theorem. The approach is based on the philosophy that occasionally one needs to pass to higher powers of \sigma, where \sigma is the endomorphism defining the difference structure. In other words, we consider difference pseudo fields (which are finite direct products of fields) rather than difference fields. We also prove a result on compatibility of pseudo fields and present some applications of the main theorem, e.g. constrained extension and uniqueness of differential Picard-Vessiot rings with a difference parameter.
