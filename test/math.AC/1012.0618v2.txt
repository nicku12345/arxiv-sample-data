We prove that a holonomic binomial D--module M_A (I,\beta) is regular if and only if certain associated primes of I determined by the parameter vector \beta\in \CC^d are homogeneous. We further describe the slopes of M_A(I,\beta) along a coordinate subspace in terms of the known slopes of some related hypergeometric D--modules that also depend on \beta. When the parameter \beta is generic, we also compute the dimension of the generic stalk of the irregularity of M_A(I,\beta) along a coordinate hyperplane and provide some remarks about the construction of its Gevrey solutions.
