Decomposing an algebraic variety into irreducible or equidimensional components is a fundamental task in classical algebraic geometry and has various applications in modern geometry engineering. Several researchers studied the problem and developed efficient algorithms using Gr\"{o}bner basis method. In this paper, we try to modify the computation of unmixed decomposition of an algebraic variety based on improving the computation of Zero(sat(\mathbb{T})), where \mathbb{T} is a triangular set in \textbf{K[X]}.
