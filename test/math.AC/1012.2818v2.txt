We consider the following conjecture: if X is a smooth projective variety over a field of characteristic zero, then there is a dense set of reductions X_s of X to positive characteristic such that the action of the Frobenius morphism on the top Zariski cohomology of the structure sheaf of X_s is bijective. We also consider a conjecture relating certain invariants of singularities in characteristic zero (the multiplier ideals) with invariants in positive characteristic (the test ideals). We prove that the former conjecture implies the latter one in the case of ambient nonsingular varieties.
