We consider the following conjecture: if X is a smooth projective variety over a field of characteristic zero, then there is a dense set of reductions X_s to positive characteristic such that the action of the Frobenius morphism on the top Zariski cohomology of the structure sheaf on X_s is bijective. We also consider the conjecture relating the multiplier ideals of an ideal J on a nonsingular variety in characteristic zero, and the test ideals of the reductions of J to positive characteristic. We prove that the latter conjecture implies the former one. The converse was proved in a joint paper of the author with V. Srinivas.
