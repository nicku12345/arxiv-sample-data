This paper presents a conception for computing gr\"{o}bner basis. We convert some of gr\"{o}bner-computing algorithms, e.g., F5, extended F5 and GWV algorithms into a special type of algorithm. The new algorithm's finite termination problem can be described by equivalent conditions, so all the above algorithms can be determined when they terminate finitely. At last, a new criterion is presented. It is an improvement for the Rewritten and Signature Criterion.
