Let R=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}R_n, \fa\supseteq \bigoplus_{n> 0}R_n and M and N be a standard graded ring, an ideal of R and two finitely generated graded R-modules, respectively. This paper studies the homogeneous components of graded generalized local cohomology modules. First of all, we show that for all i\geq 0, H^i_{\fa}(M, N)_n, the n-th graded component of the i-th generalized local cohomology module of M and N with respect to \fa, vanishes for all n\gg 0. Furthermore, some sufficient conditions are proposed to satisfy the equality \sup\{\en(H^i_{\fa}(M, N))| i\geq 0\}= \sup\{\en(H^i_{R_+}(M, N))| i\geq 0\}. Some sufficient conditions are also proposed for tameness of H^i_{\fa}(M, N) such that i= f_{\fa}^{R_+}(M, N) or i= \cd_{\fa}(M, N), where f_{\fa}^{R_+}(M, N) and \cd_{\fa}(M, N) denote the R_+-finiteness dimension and the cohomological dimension of M and N with respect to \fa, respectively. We finally consider the Artinian property of some submodules and quotient modules of H^j_{\fa}(M, N), where j is the first or last non-minimax level of H^i_{\fa}(M, N).
