Let \Delta be simplicial complex and let k[\Delta] denote the Stanley--Reisner ring corresponding to \Delta. Suppose that k[\Delta] has a pure free resolution. Then we describe the Betti numbers and the Hilbert--Samuel multiplicity of k[\Delta] in terms of the h--vector of \Delta. As an application, we derive a linear equation system for the components of the h--vector of the clique complex of an arbitrary chordal graph.
