In this article, I give an iterative closed form formula for the Hilbert-Kunz function for any binomial hypersurface in general, over any feild of arbitrary positive characteristic. I prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity associated to any Binomial Hypersurface over any field of arbitrary positive characteristic is rational. As an example, I also prove the well known fact that for 1-dimensional Binomial Hypersurfaces, the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is a positive integer and give a precise account of the integer.
