We investigate the uniqueness of factorisation of possibly disconnected finite graphs with respect to the Cartesian, the strong and the direct product. It is proved that if a graph has n connected components, where n is prime, or n=1,4,8,9, and satisfies some additional conditions, it factors uniquely under the given products. If, on the contrary, n=6 or 10, all cases of nonunique factorisation are described precisely.
