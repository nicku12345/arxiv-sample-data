A special class of algebras which are intermediate between the symmetric and the Rees algebras of an ideal was introduced by P. Aluffi in 2004 to define characteristic cycle of a hypersurface parallel to conormal cycle in intersection theory. These algebras are recently investigated by A. Nasrollah Nejad and A. Simis who named them Aluffi algebras. For a pair of ideals J\subseteq I of a commutative ring R, the Aluffi algebra of I/J is called Aluffi torsion-free if it is isomorphic to the Rees algebra of I/J. In this paper, ideals generated by 2-minors of a 2\times n matrix of linear forms and also edge ideals of graphs are considered and some conditions are presented which are equivalent to Aluffi torsion-free property of them. Also many other examples and further questions are presented.
