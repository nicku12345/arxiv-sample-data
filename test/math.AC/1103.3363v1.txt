Given a finite field \F_q and n\in \N^*, one could try to compute all polynomial endomorphisms \F_q^n\lp \F_q^n up to a certain degree with a specific property. We consider the case n=3. If the degree is low (like 2,3, or 4) and the finite field is small (q\leq 7) then some of the computations are still feasible. In this article we study the following properties of endomorphisms: being a bijection of \F_q^n\lp \F_q^n, being a polynomial automorphism, being a {\em Mock automorphism}, and being a locally finite polynomial automorphism. In the resulting tables, we point out a few interesting objects, and pose some interesting conjectures which surfaced through our computations.
