We prove that all polynomials in several variables can be decomposed as the sums of kth powers: P(x_1,...,x_n) = Q_1(x_1,...,x_n)^k+...+ Q_s(x_1,...,x_n)^k, provided that elements of the base field are themselves sums of kth powers. We also give bounds for the number of terms s and the degree of the Q_i^k. We then improve these bounds in the case of two variables polynomials of large degree to get a decomposition P(x,y) = Q_1(x,y)^k+...+ Q_s(x,y)^k with \deg Q_i^k \le \deg P + k^3 and s that depends on k and \ln (\deg P).
