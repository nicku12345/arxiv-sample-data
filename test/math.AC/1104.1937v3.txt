Let R be a ring of prime characteristic p, and let F^e_* R denote R viewed as an R-module via the eth iterated Frobenius map. Given a surjective map \phi : F^e_* R \to R (for example a Frobenius splitting), we exhibit an algorithm which produces all the \phi-compatible ideals.   We also explore a variant of this algorithm under the hypothesis that \phi is not necessarily a Frobenius splitting (or even surjective). This algorithm, and the original, have been implemented in Macaulay2.
