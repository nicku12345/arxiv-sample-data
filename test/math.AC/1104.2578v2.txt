We find conditions on ideals of an algebra under which the algebra is dibaric. Dibaric algebras have not non-zero homomorphisms to the set of the real numbers. We introduce a concept of bq-homomorphism (which is given by two linear maps f, g of the algebra to the set of the real numbers) and show that an algebra is dibaric if and only if it admits a non-zero bq-homomorphism. Using the pair (f,g) we define conservative algebras and establish criteria for a dibaric algebra to be conservative. Moreover, the notions of a Bernstein algebra and an algebra induced by a linear operator are introduced and relations between these algebras are studied. For dibaric algebras we describe a dibaric algebra homomorphism and study their properties by bq-homomorphisms of the dibaric algebras. We apply the results to the (dibaric) evolution algebra of a bisexual population. For this dibaric algebra we describe all possible bq-homomorphisms and find conditions under which the algebra of a bisexual population is induced by a linear operator. Moreover, some properties of dibaric algebra homomorphisms of such algebras are studied.
