Border bases, a generalization of Groebner bases, have actively been researched during recent years due to their applicability to industrial problems. A. Kehrein and M. Kreuzer formulated the so called Border Basis Algorithm, an algorithm which allows the computation of border bases that relate to a degree compatible term ordering. In this paper we extend the original Border Basis Algorithm in such a way that also border bases that do not relate to any term ordering can be computed by it.
