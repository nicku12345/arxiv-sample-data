The main theorem in this paper is that the base change functor from an abelian category \cA to its polynomial category in the sense of Schlichting -\otimes_{\cA}\bbZ[t]:\cA \to \cA[t] induces an isomorphism on their K-theories if \cA is noetherian and has enough projective objects. The main theorem implies the well-known fact that \mathbb{A}^1-homotopy invariance of K'-theory for noetherian schemes.
