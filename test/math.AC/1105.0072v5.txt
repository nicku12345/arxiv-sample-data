This paper presents three results on F-singularities. First, we give a new proof of Eisenstein's restriction theorem for adjoint ideal sheaves, using the theory of F-singularities. Second, we show that a conjecture of Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Srinivas implies a conjectural correspondence of F-purity and log canonicity. Finally, we prove this correspondence when the defining equations of the variety are very general.
