B. Harbourne and C. Huneke conjectured that for any ideal I of fat points in P^N its r-th symbolic power I^{(r)} should be contained in M^{(N-1)r}I^r, where M denotes the homogeneous maximal ideal in the ring of coordinates of P^N. We show that this conjecture holds for the ideal of any number of simple (not fat) points in general position in P^3 and for at most N+1 simple points in general position in P^N. As a corollary we give a positive answer to Chudnovsky Conjecture in the case of generic points in P^3.
