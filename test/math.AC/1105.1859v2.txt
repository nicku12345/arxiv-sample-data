A simplicial cell ball is a simplicial poset whose geometric realization is homeomorphic to a ball. Recently, Samuel Kolins gave a series of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions on h-vectors of simplicial cell balls, and characterized them up to dimension 6. In this paper, we extend Kolins' results. We characterize all possible h-vectors of simplicial cell balls in arbitrary dimension.
