In this paper we study the finitely generated bigraded modules over a standard bigraded polynomial ring which are relative Cohen-Macaulay or relative unmixed with respect to one of the irrelevant bigraded ideals. A generalization of Reisner's criterion for Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complexes is considered.
