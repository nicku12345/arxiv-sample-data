Let A be a DG algebra with a trivial differential over a commutative unital ring. This paper investigates the image of the totaling functor, defined from the category of complexes of graded A-modules to the category of DG A-modules. Specifically, we exhibit a special class of semifree DG A-modules which can always be expressed as the totaling of some complex of graded free A-modules. As a corollary, we also provide results concerning the image of the totaling functor when A is a polynomial ring over a field.
