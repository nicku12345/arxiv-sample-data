This paper provides effective methods for the polyhedral formulation of impartial finite combinatorial games as lattice games. Given a rational strategy for a lattice game, a polynomial time algorithm is presented to decide (i) whether a given position is a winning position, and to find a move to a winning position, if not; and (ii) to decide whether two given positions are congruent, in the sense of mis\`ere quotient theory. The methods are based on the theory of short rational generating functions.
