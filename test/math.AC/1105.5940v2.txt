In this paper we prove that the P(q,\ell) (q odd prime power and \ell>1 odd) commutative semifields constructed by Bierbrauer in \cite{BierbrauerSub} are isotopic to some commutative presemifields constructed by Budaghyan and Helleseth in \cite{BuHe2008}. Also, we show that they are strongly isotopic if and only if q\equiv 1(mod\,4). Consequently, for each q\equiv -1(mod\,4) there exist isotopic commutative presemifields of order q^{2\ell} (\ell>1 odd) defining CCZ--inequivalent planar DO polynomials.
