We present a new relation between an invariant of singularities in characteristic zero (the log canonical threshold) and an invariant of singularities defined via the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic (the F-pure threshold). We show that the set of limit points of sequences of the form (c_p), where c_p is the F-pure threshold of an ideal on an n-dimensional smooth variety in characteristic p, coincides with the set of log canonical thresholds of ideals on n-dimensional smooth varieties in characteristic zero. We prove this by combining results of Hara and Yoshida with non-standard constructions.
