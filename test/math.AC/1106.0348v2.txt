A semiring is an algebraic structure similar to a ring, but without the requirement that each element must have an additive inverse. A po-semiring is a semiring equipped with a compatible bounded partial order. In this paper, properties of zero divisors and prime elements of a po-semiring are studied. In particular, it is proved that under some mild assumption the set Z(A) of nonzero zero divisors of A is A\setminus \{0,1\}, each prime element of A is a maximal element, and the zero divisor graph \G(A) of A is a finite graph if and only if A is finite. For a po-semiring A with Z(A)=A\setminus \{0,1\}, it is proved that A has finitely many maximal elements if ACC holds either for elements of A or for principal annihilating ideals of A. As applications of prime elements, it is shown that the structure of a po-semiring A is completely determined by the structure of integral po-semirings if either |Z(A)|=1 or |Z(A)|=2 and Z(A)^2\not=0. Applications to the ideal structure of commutative rings are considered.
