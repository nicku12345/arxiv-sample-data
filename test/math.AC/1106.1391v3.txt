Let k be a commutative ring and A a commutative k-algebra. Given a positive integer m, or m=\infty, we say that a k-linear derivation \delta of A is m-integrable if it extends up to a Hasse--Schmidt derivation D=(\Id,D_1=\delta,D_2,...,D_m) of A over k of length m. This condition is automatically satisfied for any m under one of the following orthogonal hypotheses: (1) k contains the rational numbers and A is arbitrary, since we can take D_i=\frac{\delta^i}{i!}; (2) k is arbitrary and A is a smooth k-algebra. The set of m-integrable derivations of A over k is an A-module which will be denoted by \Ider_k(A;m). In this paper we prove that, if A is a finitely presented k-algebra and m is a positive integer, then a k-linear derivation \delta of A is m-integrable if and only if the induced derivation \delta_{\mathfrak{p}}:A_{\mathfrak{p}} \to A_{\mathfrak{p}}  is m-integrable for each prime ideal \mathfrak{p}\subset A. In particular, for any locally finitely presented morphism of schemes f:X \to S and any positive integer m, the S-derivations of X which are locally m-integrable form a quasi-coherent submodule \fIder_S(\OO_X;m)\subset \fDer_S(\OO_X) such that, for any affine open sets U=\Spec A \subset X and V=\Spec k \subset S, with f(U)\subset V, we have \Gamma(U,\fIder_S(\OO_X;m))=\Ider_k(A;m) and \fIder_S(\OO_X;m)_p = \Ider_{\OO_{S,f(p)}}(\OO_{X,p};m) for each p\in X. We also give, for each positive integer m, an algorithm to decide whether all derivations are m-integrable or not.
