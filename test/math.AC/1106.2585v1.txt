Let \mathscr{I} be an ideal sheaf on P^n defining a subscheme X. Associated to \mathscr{I} there are two elementary invariants: the invariant s which measures the positivity of \mathscr{I}, and the minimal number d such that \mathscr{I}(d) is generated by its global sections. It is now clear that the asymptotic behavior of \reg \mathscr{I}^t is governed by s but usually not linear. In this paper, we first describe the linear behavior of the asymptotic regularity by showing that if s=d, i.e., s reaches its maximal value, then for t large enough \reg \mathscr{I}^t=dt+e for some positive constant e. We then turn to concrete geometric settings to study the asymptotic regularity of \mathscr{I} in the case that X is a nonsingular variety embedded by a very ample adjoint line bundle. Our approach also gives regularity bounds for \mathscr{I}^t once we know \reg \mathscr{I} and assume that X is a local complete intersection.
