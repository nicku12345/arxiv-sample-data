Let R be a reduced affine \mathbb C-algebra, with corresponding affine algebraic set X. Let \mathcal C(X) be the ring of continuous (Euclidean topology) \mathbb C-valued functions on X. Brenner defined the \emph{continuous closure} I^{\rm cont} of an ideal I as I\mathcal C(X) \cap R. He also introduced an algebraic notion of \emph{axes closure} I^{\rm ax} that always contains I^{\rm cont}, and asked whether they coincide. We extend the notion of axes closure to general Noetherian rings, defining f \in I^{\rm ax} if its image is in IS for every homomorphism R \to S, where S is a one-dimensional complete seminormal local ring. We also introduce the \emph{natural closure} I^\natural of I. One of many characterizations is I^\natural = I + \{f \in R: \exists n >0 \text{ with } f^n \in I^{n+1}\}. We show that I^\natural \subseteq I^{\rm ax}, and that when continuous closure is defined, I^\natural \subseteq I^{\rm cont }\subseteq I^{\rm ax}. Under mild hypotheses on the ring, we show that I^\natural= I^{\rm ax} when I is primary to a maximal ideal, and that if I has no embedded primes, then I = I^\natural if and only if I = I^{\rm ax}, so that I^{\rm cont} agrees as well. We deduce that in the polynomial ring \mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_n], if f = 0 at all points where all of the {\partial f \over \partial x_i} are 0, then f \in ( {\partial f \over \partial x_1}, \, \ldots, \, {\partial f \over \partial x_n})R. We characterize I^{\rm cont} for monomial ideals in polynomial rings over \mathbb C, but we show that the inequalities I^\natural \subset I^{\rm cont} and I^{\rm cont} \subset I^{\rm ax} can be strict for monomial ideals even in dimension 3. Thus, I^{\rm cont} and I^{\rm ax} need not agree, although we prove they are equal in \mathbb C[x_1, x_2].
