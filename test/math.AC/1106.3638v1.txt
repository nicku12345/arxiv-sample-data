Let M be a finitely generated graded module over a Noetherian homogeneous ring R = \bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0}R_n. For each i \in \mathbb{N}_0 let H^i_{R_{+}}(M) denote the i-th local cohomology module of M with respect to the irrelevant ideal R_+ = \bigoplus_{n > 0} R_n of R, furnished with its natural grading. We study the tame loci \ft^i(M)^{\leq 3} at level i \in \mathbb{N}_0 in codimension \leq 3 of M, that is the sets of all primes \fp_0 \subset R_0 of height \leq 3 such that the graded R_{\fp_0}-modules H^i_{R_{+}}(M)_{\fp_0} are tame.
