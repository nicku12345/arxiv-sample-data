In [7] we obtained a formula for the Hilbert depth of squarefree Veronese ideals in a standard graded polynomial ring by relating it to the Hilbert depth of powers of the irrelevant maximal ideal. In this paper, we prove that these two Hilbert depth formulas are equivalent to each other. Our result reveals that there is a strong connection between these two classes of seemingly unrelated monomial ideals. We conjecture that their Stanley depths are equivalent as well.
