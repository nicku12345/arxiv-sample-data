A well-known generalisation of positional numeration systems is the case where the base is the residue class of x modulo a given polynomial f(x) with coefficients in (for example) the integers, and where we try to construct finite expansions for all residue classes modulo f(x), using a suitably chosen digit set. We give precise conditions under which direct or fibred products of two such polynomial number systems are again of the same form. The main tool is a general form of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We give applications to simultaneous number systems in the integers.
