Let b be a fractional ideal of a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring O containing a perfect field k. This paper is devoted to the study some O-modules associated with b. In addition, different motivic Poincar\'e series are introduced by considering ideal filtrations associated with b; the corresponding functional equations of these Poincar\'e series are also described.
