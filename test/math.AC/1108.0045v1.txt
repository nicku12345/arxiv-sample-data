In this paper, we are interested in the generic initial ideals of \textit{singular} projective curves with respect to the graded lexicographic order. Let C be a \textit{singular} irreducible projective curve of degree d\geq 5 with the arithmetic genus \rho_a(C) in \p^r where r\ge 3. If M(I_C) is the regularity of the lexicographic generic initial ideal of I_C in a polynomial ring k[x_0,..., x_r] then we prove that M(I_C) is 1+\binom{d-1}{2}-\rho_a(C) which is obtained from the monomial  x_{r-3} x_{r-1}\,^{\binom{d-1}{2}-\rho_a(C)},  provided that \dim\Tan_p(C)=2 for every singular point p \in C. This number is equal to one plus the number of non-isomorphic points under a generic projection of C into \p^2. %if \deg(C)=3,4 then M(I_C)= \deg(C) by the direct computation. Our result generalizes the work of J. Ahn for \textit{smooth} projective curves and that of A. Conca and J. Sidman \cite{CS} for \textit{smooth} complete intersection curves in \p^3. The case of singular curves was motivated by \cite[Example 4.3]{CS} due to A. Conca and J. Sidman. We also provide some illuminating examples of our results via calculations done with {\it Macaulay 2} and \texttt {Singular} \cite{DGPS, GS}.
