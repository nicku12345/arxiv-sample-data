Since a tropical Nullstellensatz fails even for tropical univariate polynomials we study a conjecture on a tropical {\it dual} Nullstellensatz for tropical polynomial systems in terms of solvability of a tropical linear system with the Cayley matrix associated to the tropical polynomial system. The conjecture on a tropical effective dual Nullstellensatz is proved for tropical univariate polynomials.
