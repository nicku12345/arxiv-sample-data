First we construct a free resolution for the Milnor (or Jacobian) algebra M(f) of a complex projective Chebyshev plane curve \CC_d:f=0 of degree d. In particular, this resolution implies that the dimensions of the graded components M(f)_k are constant for k \geq 2d-3. Then we show that the Milnor algebra of a nodal plane curve C has such a behaviour if and only if all the irreducible components of C are rational. For the Chebyshev curves, all of these components are in addition smooth, hence they are lines or conics and explicit factorizations are given in this case.
