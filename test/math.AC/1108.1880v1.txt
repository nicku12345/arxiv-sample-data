Supertropical monoids are a structure slightly more general than the supertropical semirings, which have been introduced and used by the first and the third authors for refinements of tropical geometry and matrix theory in [IR1]-[IR3], and then studied by us in a systematic way in [IKR1]-[IKR3] in connection with "supervaluations".   In the present paper we establish a category \STROP_m of supertropical monoids by choosing as morphisms the "transmissions", defined in the same way as done in [IKR1] for supertropical semirings. The previously investigated category STROP of supertropical semirings is a full subcategory of STROP_m. Moreover, there is associated to every supertropical monoid V a supertropical semiring \hat V in a canonical way.   A central problem in [IKR1]-[IKR3] has been to find for a supertropical semiring U the quotient U/E by a "TE-relation", which is a certain kind of equivalence relation on the set U compatible with multiplication (cf. [IK1, Definition 4.5]). It turns out that this quotient always exists in \STROP_m. In the good case, that U/E is a supertropical semiring, this is also the right quotient in \STROP. Otherwise, analyzing (U/E)^\wedge, we obtain a mild modification of E to a TE-relation E' such that U/E' = (U/E)^\wedge in \STROP.   In this way we now can solve various problems left open in [IKR1], [IKR2] and gain further insight into the structure of transmissions and supervaluations. Via supertropical monoids we also obtain new results on totally ordered supervaluations and monotone transmissions studied in [IKR3].
