Let (a_n)_{n \geq 0} be a sequence of integers such that its generating series satisfies \sum_{n \geq 0} a_nt^n = \frac{h(t)}{(1-t)^d} for some polynomial h(t). For any r \geq 1 we study the coefficient sequence of the numerator polynomial h_0(a^{<r >}) +...+ h_{\lambda'}(a^{<r >}) t^{\lambda'} of the r\textsuperscript{th} Veronese series a^{<r >}(t) = \sum_{n \geq 0} a_{nr} t^n. Under mild hypothesis we show that the vector of successive differences of this sequence up to the \lfloor \frac{d}{2} \rfloor\textsuperscript{th} entry is the f-vector of a simplicial complex for large r. In particular, the sequence satisfies the consequences of the unimodality part of the g-conjecture. We give applications of the main result to Hilbert series of Veronese algebras of standard graded algebras and the f-vectors of edgewise subdivisions of simplicial complexes.
