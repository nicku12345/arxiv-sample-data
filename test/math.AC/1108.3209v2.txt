In this paper we explore some categorical results of 2-crossed module of commutative algebras extending work of Porter in [18]. We also show that the forgetful functor from the category of 2-crossed modules to the category of k-algebras, taking {L, M, P, \partial_2, \partial_1} to the base algebra P, is fibred and cofibred considering the pullback (coinduced) and induced 2-crossed modules constructions, respectively. Also we consider free 2- crossed modules as an application of induced 2-crossed modules.
