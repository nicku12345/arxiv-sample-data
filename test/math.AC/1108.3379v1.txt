Let G be a finite group and k be a field. Let G act on the rational function field k(x_g:g\in G) by k-automorphisms defined by g\cdot x_h=x_{gh} for any g,h\in G. Noether's problem asks whether the fixed field k(G)=k(x_g:g\in G)^G is rational (i.e. purely transcendental) over k. Theorem 1. If G is a group of order 2^n (n\ge 4) and of exponent 2^e such that (i) e\ge n-2 and (ii) \zeta_{2^{e-1}} \in k, then k(G) is k-rational. Theorem 2. Let G be a group of order 4n where n is any positive integer (it is unnecessary to assume that n is a power of 2). Assume that {\rm (i)} \fn{char}k \ne 2, \zeta_n \in k, and {\rm (ii)} G contains an element of order n. Then k(G) is rational over k, except for the case n=2m and G \simeq C_m \rtimes C_8 where m is an odd integer and the center of G is of even order (note that C_m is normal in C_m \rtimes C_8) ; for the exceptional case, k(G) is rational over k if and only if at least one of -1, 2, -2 belongs to (k^{\times})^2.
