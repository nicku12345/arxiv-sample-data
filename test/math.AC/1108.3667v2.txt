We consider ideals generated by general sets of m-minors of an m\times n-matrix of indeterminates. The generators are identified with the facets of an (m-1)-dimensional pure simplicial complex. The ideal generated by the minors corresponding to the facets of such a complex is called a determinantal facet ideal. Given a pure simplicial complex \Delta, we discuss the question when the generating minors of its determinantal facet ideal J_\Delta form a Gr\"obner basis and when J_\Delta is a prime ideal.
