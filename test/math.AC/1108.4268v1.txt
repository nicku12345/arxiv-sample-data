In earlier papers it was shown that the generic tropical variety of an ideal can contain information on algebraic invariants as for example the depth in a direct way. The existence of generic tropical varieties has so far been proved in the constant coefficient case for the usual notion of genericity. In this paper we generalize this existence result to include the case of non-constant coefficients in certain settings. Moreover, we extend the notion of genericity to arbitrary closed subvarieties of the general linear group. In addition to including the concept of genericity on algebraic groups this yields structural results on the tropical variety of an ideal under an arbitrary linear coordinate change.
