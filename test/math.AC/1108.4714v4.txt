We study the deformation-obstruction theory of Koszul cohomology groups of g^r_d's on singular nodal curves. We compute the obstruction classes for Koszul cohomology classes on singular curves to deform to a smooth one. In the case the obstructions are nontrivial, we obtain some partial results for generic vanishing of Koszul cohomology groups.
