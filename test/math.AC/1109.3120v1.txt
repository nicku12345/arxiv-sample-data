Let R be a Gorenstein local ring which is locally a hypersurface on the punctured spectrum. In this paper, we classify thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of finitely generated R-modules. Moreover, using this classification, we also classify thick subcategories of finitely generated R-modules, and find out the relationships with thick subcategories of Cohen-Macaulay R-modules.
