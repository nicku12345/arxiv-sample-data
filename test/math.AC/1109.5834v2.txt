The associated prime ideals of powers of polymatroidal ideals are studied, including the stable set of associated prime ideals of this class of ideals. It is shown that polymatroidal ideals have the persistence property and for transversal polymatroids and polymatroidal ideals of Veronese type the index of stability and the stable set of associated ideals is determined explicitly.
