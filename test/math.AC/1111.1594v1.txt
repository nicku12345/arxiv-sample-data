We study how forcing algebras give rise to {\mathbb A}^1-bundles and {\mathbb A}^1-torsors and how they are related to {\mathbb A}^1-patches. In particular we discuss the affineness of torsors and how algebraic properties of {\mathbb A}^1-patches can be deduced from this property. This is in part a survey article.
