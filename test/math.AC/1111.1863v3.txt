We give an affirmative answer to Wilf's conjecture for numerical semigroups satisfying 2 \nu \geq m, where \nu and m are respectively the embedding dimension and the multiplicity of a semigroup. The conjecture is also proved when m \leq 8 and when the semigroup is generated by a generalized arithmetic sequence.
