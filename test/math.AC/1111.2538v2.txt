The ring of classic Witt vectors is a fundamental object in mixed characteristic commutative algebra which has many applications in number theory. There is a significant generalization due to Dress and Siebeneicher which for any profinite group G produces a ring valued functor W_G, where the classic Witt vectors are recovered as the example G = Z_p. This article explores the structure of the image of this functor where G is the pro-2 group formed by taking the inverse limit of 2-power dihedral groups, and the image of W_G is taken on a field of characteristic 2.
