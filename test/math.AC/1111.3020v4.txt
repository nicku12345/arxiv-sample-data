In this article, we discuss the semicontinuity problem of certain properties on fibers for a morphism of schemes. One aspect of this problem is local. Namely, we consider properties of schemes at the level of local rings, in which the main results are established by solving the lifting and localization problems for local rings. In particular, we obtain the localization theorems in the case of seminormal and F-rational rings, respectively. Another aspect of this problem is global, which is often related to the vanishing problem of certain higher direct image sheaves. As a test example, we consider the deformation of the global F-regularity.
