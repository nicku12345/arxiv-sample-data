The notion of almost symmetric numerical semigroup was given by V. Barucci and R. Fr\"oberg. We characterize almost symmetric numerical semigroups by symmetry of pseudo-Frobenius numbers. We give a criterion for H^* (the dual of M) to be almost symmetric numerical semigroup. Using these results we give a formula for multiplicity of an opened modular numerical semigroups. Finally, we show that if H_1 or H_2 is not symmetric, then the gluing of H_1 and H_2 is not almost symmetric.
