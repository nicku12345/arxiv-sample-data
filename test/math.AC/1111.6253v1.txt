We describe the ideals, especially the prime ideals, of semirings of polynomials over layered domains, and in particular over supertropical domains. Since there are so many of them, special attention is paid to the ideals arising from layered varieties, for which we prove that every prime ideal is a consequence of finitely many binomials. We also obtain layered tropical versions of the classical Principal Ideal Theorem and Hilbert Basis Theorem.
