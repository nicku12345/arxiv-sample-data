We generalize known results on summands of completely decomposable and separable torsion-free abelian groups to modules over h-local Pr\"ufer domains. Over such domains summands of completely decomposable torsion-free modules are again completely decomposable (Theorem 3.2) and summands of separable torsion-free modules are likewise separable (Theorem 4.2). In addition, a Pontryagin-Hill type theorem is established on countable chains of homogeneous completely decomposable modules over h-local Pr\"ufer domains.
