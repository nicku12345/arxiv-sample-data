Motivated by Hill's criterion of freeness for abelian groups, we investigate conditions under which unions of ascending chains of balanced-projective modules over integral domains are again balanced-projective. Our main result establishes that, in order for a torsion-free module to be balanced-projective, it is sufficient that it be the union of a countable, ascending chain of balanced-projective, pure submodules. The proof reduces to the completely decomposable case, and it hinges on the existence of suitable families of submodules of the links in the chain. A Shelah-Eklof-type result for the balanced projectivity of modules is proved in the way, and a generalization of Auslander's lemma is obtained as a corollary.
