We deal with the Weak Lefschetz property (WLP) for Artinian standard graded Gorenstein algebras of codimension 3. We prove that many Gorenstein sequences force the WLP for such algebras. Moreover for every Gorenstein sequence H of codimension 3 we found several Gorenstein Betti sequences compatible with H which again force the WLP. Finally we show that for every Gorenstein Betti sequence the general Artinian standard graded Gorenstein algebra with such Betti sequence has the WLP.
