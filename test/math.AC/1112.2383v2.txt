A singularity in characteristic zero is said to be of dense F-pure type if its modulo p reduction is locally F-split for infinitely many p. We prove that if x \in X is an isolated log canonical singularity with \mu(x \in X) \le 2 (see Definition 1.4 for the definition of the invariant \mu), then it is of dense F-pure type. As a corollary, we prove the equivalence of log canonicity and being of dense F-pure type in the case of three-dimensional isolated singularities.
