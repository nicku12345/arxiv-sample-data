In this article, we consider the conjectured relationship between F-purity and log canonicity for polynomials over the complex numbers. We associate to a collection M of n monomials a rational polytope P contained in [0,1]^n. Using P and the Newton polyhedron associated to M, we define a non-degeneracy condition under which log canonicity and dense F-pure type are equivalent for all linear combinations of the monomials in M. We also show that log canonicity corresponds to F-purity for very general polynomials. Our methods rely on showing that the F-pure and log canonical threshold agree for infinitely primes, and we accomplish this by comparing these thresholds with the thresholds associated to their monomial ideals.
