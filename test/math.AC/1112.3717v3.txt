Let K be a field, S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_m, y_1,\ldots,y_n] be a standard bigraded polynomial ring and M a finitely generated bigraded S-module. In this paper we study sequentially Cohen--Macaulayness of M with respect to Q=(y_1,\ldots,y_n). We characterize the sequentially Cohen--Macaulayness of L\tensor_KN with respect to Q as an S-module when L and N are non-zero finitely generated graded modules over K[x_1, \dots, x_m] and K[y_1, \dots, y_n], respectively. All hypersurface rings that are sequentially Cohen--Macaulay with respect to Q are classified.
