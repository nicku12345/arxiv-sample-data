With a simple graph G on [n], we associate a binomial ideal P_G generated by diagonal minors of an n \times n matrix X=(x_{ij}) of variables. We show that for any graph G, P_G is a prime complete intersection ideal and determine the divisor class group of K[X]/ P_G. By using these ideals, one may find a normal domain with free divisor class group of any given rank.
