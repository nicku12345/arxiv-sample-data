We present a new closed form for the interpolating polynomial of the general univariate Hermite interpolation that requires only calculation of polynomial derivatives, instead of derivatives of rational functions. This result is used to obtain a new simultaneous polynomial division by a common divisor over a perfect field. The above findings are utilized to obtain a closed formula for the semi--simple part of the Jordan decomposition of a matrix. Finally, a number of new identities involving polynomial derivatives are obtained, based on the proposed simultaneous polynomial division. The proposed explicit formula for the semi--simple part has been implemented using the Matlab programming environment.
