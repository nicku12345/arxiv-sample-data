In this paper, we investigate Lefschetz properties of Veronese subalgebras. We show that, for a sufficiently large r, the r\textsuperscript{th} Veronese subalgebra of a Cohen-Macaulay standard graded K-algebra has properties similar to the weak and strong Lefschetz properties, which we call the `almost weak' and `almost strong' Lefschetz properties. By using this result, we obtain new results on h- and g-polynomials of Veronese subalgebras.
