Let G be a finite connected simple graph with d vertices and let \Pc_G \subset \RR^d be the edge polytope of G. We call \Pc_G \emph{decomposable} if \Pc_G decomposes into integral polytopes \Pc_{G^+} and \Pc_{G^-} via a hyperplane. In this paper, we explore various aspects of decomposition of \Pc_G: we give an algorithm deciding the decomposability of \Pc_G, we prove that \Pc_G is normal if and only if both \Pc_{G^+} and \Pc_{G^-} are normal, and we also study how a condition on the toric ideal of \Pc_G (namely, the ideal being generated by quadratic binomials) behaves under decomposition.
