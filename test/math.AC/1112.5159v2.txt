Let K be a field and I a monomial ideal of the polynomial ring S=K[x_1,..., x_n] generated by monomials u_1,u_2,..., u_t. We show that S/I is pretty clean if either: 1) u_1,u_2,..., u_t is a filter-regular sequence, 2) u_1,u_2,..., u_t is a d-sequence; or 3) I is almost complete intersection. In particular, in each of these cases, S/I is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay and both Stanley's and h-regularity conjectures, on Stanley decompositions, hold for S/I. Also, we prove that if I is the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a locally complete intersection simplicial complex on [n], then Stanley's conjecture holds for S/I.
