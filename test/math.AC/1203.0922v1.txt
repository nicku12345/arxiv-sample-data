We use the theory of lexicographic shellability to provide various examples in which the rank of the homology of a Rees product of two partially ordered sets enumerates some set of combinatorial objects, perhaps according to some natural statistic on the set. Many of these examples generalize a result of J. Jonsson, which says that the rank of the unique nontrivial homology group of the Rees product of a truncated Boolean algebra of degree n and a chain of length n-1 is the number of derangements in \S_n.\
