We define and study a version of Seshadri constant for ample line bundles in positive characteristic. We prove that lower bounds for this constant imply the global generation or very ampleness of the corresponding adjoint line bundle. As a consequence, we deduce that the criterion for global generation and very ampleness of adjoint line bundles in terms of usual Seshadri constants holds also in positive characteristic.
