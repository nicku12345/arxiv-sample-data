Let S = K[x_1,..., x_n] be a polynomial ring over a field K. Let I(G) \subseteq S denote the edge ideal of a graph G. We show that the \ellth symbolic power I(G)^{(\ell)} is a Cohen-Macaulay ideal (i.e., S/I(G)^{(\ell)} is Cohen-Macaulay) for some integer \ell \ge 3 if and only if G is a disjoint union of finitely many complete graphs. When this is the case, all the symbolic powers I(G)^{(\ell)} are Cohen-Macaulay ideals. Similarly, we characterize graphs G for which S/I(G)^{(\ell)} has (FLC).   As an application, we show that an edge ideal I(G) is complete intersection provided that S/I(G)^{\ell} is Cohen-Macaulay for some integer \ell \ge 3. This strengthens the main theorem in [Effective Cowsik-Nori theorem for edge ideals by M.Crupi, G.Rinaldo, N.Terai, and K.Yoshida, Comm. Alg. 38 (2010), 3347-3357].
