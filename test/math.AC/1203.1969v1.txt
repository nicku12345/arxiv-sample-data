In this paper, we study several properties of the second power I_{\Delta}^2 of a Stanley-Reisner ideal I_{\Delta} of any dimension. As the main result, we prove that S/I_{\Delta} is Gorenstein whenever S/I_{\Delta}^2 is Cohen-Macaulay over any field K. Moreover, we give a criterion for the second symbolic power of I_{\Delta} to satisfy (S_2) and to coincide with the ordinary power, respectively. Finally, we provide new examples of Stanley-Reisner ideals whose second powers are Cohen-Macaulay.
