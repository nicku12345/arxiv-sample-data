We study the complete intersection property of monomial curves in the family \Gamma_{\aa + \jj} = {(t^{a_0 + j}, t^{a_1+j},..., t^{a_n + j}) ~ | ~ j \geq 0, ~ a_0 < a_1 <...< a_n}. We prove that if \Gamma_{\aa+\jj} is a complete intersection for j \gg0, then \Gamma_{\aa+\jj+\underline{a_n}} is a complete intersection for j \gg 0. This proves a conjecture of Herzog and Srinivasan on eventual periodicity of Betti numbers of semigroup rings under translations for complete intersections. We also show that if \Gamma_{\aa+\jj} is a complete intersection for j \gg 0, then \Gamma_{\aa} is a complete intersection. We also characterize the complete intersection property of this family when n = 3.
