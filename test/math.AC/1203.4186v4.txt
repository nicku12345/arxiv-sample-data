In this paper, we use a duality between the vector space of the multi-indexed sequences over a field and the vector subspace of the sequences with finite support over this field to characterize the closed subpaces of multi-indexed sequences. Then we prove that the polynomial operator in the shift which Oberst and Willems have introduced to define time invariant discrete linear dynamical systems is the adjoint of the polynomial multiplication. We end this paper by describing these systems.
