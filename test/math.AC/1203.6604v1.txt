Let T(\Z_m \times \Z_n) denote the maximal number of points that can be placed on an m \times n discrete torus with "no three in a line," meaning no three in a coset of a cyclic subgroup of \Z_m \times \Z_n. By proving upper bounds and providing explicit constructions, for distinct primes p and q, we show that T(\Z_p \times \Z_{p^2}) = 2p and T(\Z_p \times \Z_{pq}) = p+1. Via Gr\"obner bases, we compute T(\Z_m \times \Z_n) for 2 \leq m \leq 7 and 2 \leq n \leq 19.
