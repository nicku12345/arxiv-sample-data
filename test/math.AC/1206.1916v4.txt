We describe the use of pyramid decomposition in Normaliz, a software tool for the computation of Hilbert bases and enumerative data of rational cones and affine monoids. Pyramid decomposition in connection with efficient parallelization and streamlined evaluation of simplicial cones has enabled Normaliz to process triangulations of size \approx 5\cdot 10^{11} that arise in the computation of Hilbert series related to combinatorial voting theory.
