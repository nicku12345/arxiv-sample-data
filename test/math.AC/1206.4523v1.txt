Let (R,\my) be a noetherian local ring and let M be an R-module such that \bigcap\limits_{n\geq 1} \my^n M=0. Let \hat{M} be the completion of M. We show that Ass(\hat{M})= Koatt(M) holds in the following three cases: if \dim(R)\leq 1, if \hat{M} as R-module is flat, or if M is the direct sum of R-modules which are finitely generated. If M is pure in \hat{M} then at least Ass(\hat{M}) \subset  Koatt(M) holds. If the conjecture by A.-M.Simon on complete R-modules is valid then one has Koatt(M)\subset  Ass(\hat{M}).
