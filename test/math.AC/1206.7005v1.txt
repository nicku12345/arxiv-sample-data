In this note we prove the following fact: if finite many elements p_1,p_2,...,p_n of a unique factorization domain are given such that the greatest common divisor of each pair (p_i,p_j) can be expressed as a linear combination of p_i and p_j then the greatest common divisor of all p_is also can be expressed as a linear combination of p_1,...,p_n. We prove am analogous statement in commutative rings.
