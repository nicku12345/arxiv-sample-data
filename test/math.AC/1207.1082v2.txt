Let Y be a generic link of a subvariety X of a nonsingular variety A. We give a description of the Grauert-Riemenschneider canonical sheaf of Y in terms of the multiplier ideal sheaves associated to X and use it to study the singularities of Y. As the first application, we give a criterion when Y has rational singularities and show that log canonical threshold increases and log canonical pairs are preserved in generic linkage. As another application we give a quick and simple liaison method to generalize the results of de Fernex-Ein and Chardin-Ulrich on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity bound for a projective variety.
