The algebraic method provides useful techniques to identify models in designs and to understand aliasing of polynomial models. The present note surveys the topic of Gr\"obner bases in experimental design and then describes the notion of confounding and the algebraic fan of a design. The ideas are illustrated with a variety of design examples ranging from Latin squares to screening designs.
