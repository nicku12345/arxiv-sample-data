The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we present a conjecture to the effect that the ranks of the syzygy modules of a smooth projective variety become normally distributed as the positivity of the embedding line bundle grows. Then, in an attempt to render the conjecture plausible, we prove a result suggesting that this is in any event the typical behavior from a probabilistic point of view. Specifically, we consider a "random" Betti table with a fixed number of rows, sampled according to a uniform choice of Boij-Soderberg coefficients. We compute the asymptotics of the entries as the length of the table goes to infinity, and show that they become normally distributed with high probability.
