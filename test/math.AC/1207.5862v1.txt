One deals with arbitrary reduced free divisors in a polynomial ring over a field of characteristic zero, by stressing the ideal theoretic and homological behavior of the corresponding singular locus. A particular emphasis is given to both weighted homogeneous and homogeneous polynomials, allowing to introduce new families of free divisors which do not come from hyperplane arrangements nor as explicit discriminants from singularity theory.
