In this paper by using the ring of real-valued continuous functions C(X), we prove a theorem in profinite spaces which states that for a compact Hausdorff space X, the set of its connected components X/_{\sim} endowed with some topology \mathscr{T} is a profinite space. Then we apply this result to give an alternative proof to the fact that the category of profinite spaces is a reflective subcategory in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces. Finally, under some circumstances on a space X, we compute the connected components of the space t(X) in terms of the ones of the space X.
