We investigate certain categories, associated by Fiebig with the geometric representation of a Coxeter system, via sheaves on Bruhat graphs. We modify Fiebig's definition of translation functors in order to extend it to the singular setting and use it to categorify a parabolic Hecke module. As an application we obtain a combinatorial description of indecomposable projective objects of (truncated) non-critical singular blocks of (a deformed version of) category \mathcal{O}, using indecomposable special modules over the structure algebra of the corresponding Bruhat graph.
