Let I\subset S=\KK[x_1,...,x_n] be a lexsegment ideal, generated by monomials of degree d. The main aim of this paper is to characterize when the Hilbert depth of I will be 1, in the standard graded case. In addition to this, we will give an estimate of depth of squarefree monomial ideals, generalizing a result of Popescu. We will also show that Stanley conjecture holds for squarefree stable ideals, in the multigraded case.
