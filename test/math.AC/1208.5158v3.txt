In this note we study the partition of \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}^{n} given by the regions where the mixed test ideals \tau(\mathfrak{a}_{1}^{t_{1}}... \mathfrak{a}_{n}^{t_{n}}) are constant. We show that each region can be described as the preimage of a natural number under a p-fractal function \varphi:\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}. In addition, we give some examples illustrating that these regions do not need to be composed of finitely many rational polytopes.
