Let (A,\m) be a local hypersurface with isolated singularity. We show that Hochster's theta pairing vanishes on elements that are {numerically equivalent to zero} in the Grothendieck group of A under the mild assumption that \spec A admits a resolution of singularity. We also prove that when \dim A =3, the Hochster's theta pairing is positive semidefinite. These results combine to show that the counter-example of Dutta-Hochster-McLaughlin to general vanishing of Serre's intersection multiplicity exists for any three dimensional isolated hypersurface singularity that is not a UFD and has a desingularization. Our method involves showing that theta gives a bivariant class for the morphism \spec A/\m \to \spec A. It also follows that if A is three dimensional isolated hypersurface singularity that has a desingularization, the divisor class group of A is finitely generated torsion-free.
