In 2007, Y. Shimoda, in connection with a long-standing question of J. Sally, asked whether a Noetherian local ring, such that all its prime ideals different from the maximal ideal are complete intersections, has Krull dimension at most two. In this paper, having reduced the conjecture to the case of dimension three, if the ring is regular and local of dimension three, we explicitly describe a family of prime ideals of height two minimally generated by three elements. Weakening the hypothesis of regularity, we find that, to achieve the same end, we need to add extra hypotheses, such as completeness, infiniteness of the residue field and the multiplicity of the ring being at most three. In the second part of the paper we turn our attention to the category of standard graded algebras. A geometrical approach via a double use of a Bertini Theorem, together with a result of A. Simis, B. Ulrich and W.V. Vasconcelos, allows us to obtain a definitive answer in this setting. Finally, by adapting work of M. Miller on prime Bourbaki ideals in local rings, we detail some more technical results concerning the existence in standard graded algebras of homogeneous prime ideals with an "excessive" number of generators.
