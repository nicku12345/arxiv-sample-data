Let G be a simple algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p and let \g be the Lie algebra of G. It is well known that for p large enough the spectrum of the cohomology ring for the r-th Frobenius kernel of G is homeomorphic to the commuting variety of r-tuples of elements in the nilpotent cone of \g [Suslin-Friedlander-Bendel, J. Amer. Math. Soc, \textbf{10} (1997), 693--728]. In this paper, we study both geometric and algebraic properties including irreducibility, singularity, normality and Cohen-Macaulayness of the commuting varieties C_r(\mathfrak{gl}_2), C_r(\fraksl_2) and C_r(\N) where \N is the nilpotent cone of \fraksl_2. Our calculations lead us to state a conjecture on Cohen-Macaulayness for commuting varieties of r-tuples. Furthermore, in the case when \g=\fraksl_2, we obtain interesting results about commuting varieties when adding more restrictions into each tuple. In the case of \fraksl_3, we are able to verify the aforementioned properties for C_r(\fraku). Finally, applying our calculations on the commuting variety C_r(\overline{\calO_{\sub}}) where \overline{\calO_{\sub}} is the closure of the subregular orbit in \fraksl_3, we prove that the nilpotent commuting variety C_r(\N) has singularities of codimension \ge 2.
