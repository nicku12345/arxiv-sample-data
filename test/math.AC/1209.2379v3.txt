The dynamic algorithm to compute a Gr\"obner basis is nearly twenty years old, yet it seems to have arrived stillborn; aside from two initial publications, there have been no published followups. One reason for this may be that, at first glance, the added overhead seems to outweigh the benefit; the algorithm must solve many linear programs with many linear constraints. This paper describes two methods of reducing the cost substantially, answering the problem effectively.
