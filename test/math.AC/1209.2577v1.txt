We show that for any two proper monomial ideals I and J in the polynomial ring S = k[x_1, ..., x_n] the ring S/IJ is Golod. We also show that if I is squarefree then for large enough k the quotient S/I^{(k)} of S by the kth symbolic power of I is Golod. As an application we prove that the multiplication on the cohomology algebra of some classes of moment-angle complexes is trivial.
