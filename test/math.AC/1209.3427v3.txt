Let \mathcal{G} be an ind-group and let \mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathcal{G} be a unipotent ind-subgroup. We prove that an abstract group automorphism \theta \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G} maps \mathcal{U} isomorphically onto a unipotent ind-subgroup of \mathcal{G}, provided that \theta fixes a closed torus T \subseteq \mathcal{G}, which normalizes \mathcal{U} and the action of T on \mathcal{U} by conjugation fixes only the neutral element. As an application we generalize a result by Hanspeter Kraft and the author as follows: If an abstract group automorphism of the affine Cremona group \mathcal{G}_3 in dimension 3 fixes the subgroup of tame automorphisms T{\mathcal G}_3, then it also fixes a whole family of non-tame automorphisms (including the Nagata automorphism).
