Herzog-Hibi-Hreind\'{o}ttir-Kahle-Rauh introduced the class of closed graph and they proved that the binomial edge ideal J(G) of a graph G has quadratic Gr\"{o}bner bases if G is closed. In this paper, we introduce the class of weakly closed graph as a generalization of the closed graph and prove that the quotient ring S/J(G) is F-pure if G is weakly closed. This fact is a generalization of Ohtani's theorem.
