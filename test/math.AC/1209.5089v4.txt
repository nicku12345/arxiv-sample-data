In this paper we extend one direction of Fr\"oberg's theorem on a combinatorial classification of quadratic monomial ideals with linear resolutions. We do this by generalizing the notion of a chordal graph to higher dimensions with the introduction of d-chorded and orientably-d-cycle-complete simplicial complexes. We show that a certain class of simplicial complexes, the d-dimensional trees, correspond to ideals having linear resolutions over fields of characteristic 2 and also give a necessary combinatorial condition for a monomial ideal to be componentwise linear over all fields.
