We give a geometric description of the set of holes in a non-normal affine monoid Q. The set of holes turns out to be related to the non-trivial graded components of the local cohomology of k[Q]. From this, we see how various properties of k[Q] like local normality and Serre's conditions (R_1) and (S_2) are encoded in the geometry of the holes. A combinatorial upper bound for the depth the monoid algebra k[Q] is obtained and some cases where equality holds are identified. We apply this results to seminormal affine monoids.
