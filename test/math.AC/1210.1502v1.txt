The article gives a ring theoretic perspective on cluster algebras. Gei{\ss}-Leclerc-Schr\"oer prove that all cluster variables in a cluster algebra are irreducible elements. Furthermore, they provide two necessary conditions for a cluster algebra to be a unique factorization domain, namely the irreducibility and the coprimality of the initial exchange polynomials.   We present a sufficient condition for a cluster algebra to be a unique factorization domain in terms of primary decompositions of certain ideals generated by initial cluster variables and initial exchange polynomials. As an application, the criterion enables us to decide which coefficient-free cluster algebras of Dynkin type A, D or E are unique factorization domains. Moreover, it yields a normal form for irreducible elements in cluster algebras that satisfy the condition. Proof techniques include methods from commutative algebra.   In addition, we state a conjecture about the range of application of the criterion.
