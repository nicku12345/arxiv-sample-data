Let M be a finitely generated bigraded module over the standard bigraded polynomial ring S=K[x_1,...,x_m, y_1,...,y_n], and let Q=(y_1,...,y_n). The local cohomology modules H^k_Q(M) are naturally bigraded, and the components H^k_Q(M)_j=\Dirsum_iH^k_Q(M)_{(i,j)} are finitely generated graded K[x_1,...,x_m]-modules. In this paper we study the regularity of H^k_Q(M)_j, and show in several cases that \reg H^k_Q(M)_j is linearly bounded as a function of j.
