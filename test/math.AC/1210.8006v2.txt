Let a finite group G act linearly on a finite dimensional vector space V over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>2. Assume that the quotient V/G is an isolated singularity. In the case when p does not divide the order of G, isolated singularities V/G are completely classified and their classification reduces to Zassenhaus-Vincent-Wolf classification of isolated quotient singularities over the field of complex numbers. In the present paper we show that if dimension of V is 3, then also in the modular case (p divides the order of G) classification of isolated quotient singularities reduces to Zassenhaus-Vincent-Wolf classification. Some remarks on modular quotient singularities in other dimensions and in even characteristic are also given.
