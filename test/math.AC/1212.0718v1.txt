We show that the Conjecture of Harbourne and Huneke, I^{(Nr-(N-1))} \subset M^{(r-1)(N-1)}I^{r} holds for ideals of generic (simple) points in \PP^3. As a result, for such ideals we prove the following bounds, which can be recognized as generalizations of Chudnovsky bounds: \alpha(I^{(3m-k)}) \geq m\alpha(I)+2m-k, for any m \geq 1 and k=0,1,2. Moreover, we obtain lower bounds for the Waldshmidt constant for such ideals.
