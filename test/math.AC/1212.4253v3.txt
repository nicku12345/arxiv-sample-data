Let X/k be a noetherian scheme over a field k of characteristic 0, such that the residue field at its closed points are algebraic extensions of k. Let {\mathfrak g}_{X/k}\subset T_{{X/k}} be an {\mathcal O}_{X}-submodule of the tangent sheaf which is closed under the Lie bracket. We construct a stratification of the subset of closed points in X by locally closed subsets that are preserved by {\mathfrak g}_{X/k}, on which {\mathfrak g}_{X/k} acts transitively.
