We study integrating (that is expanding to a Hasse-Schmidt derivation) derivations, and more generally truncated Hasse-Schmidt derivations, satisfying iterativity conditions given by formal group laws. Our results concern the cases of the additive and the multiplicative group laws. We generalize a theorem of Matsumura about integrating nilpotent derivations (such a generalization is implicit in work of Ziegler) and we also generalize a theorem of Tyc about integrating idempotent derivations.
