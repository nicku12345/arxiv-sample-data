Let G=(V,E) be a finite, simple graph. We consider for each oriented graph G_{\cal O} associated to an orientation {\cal O} of the edges of G, the toric ideal P_{G_{\cal O}}. In this paper we study those graphs with the property that P_{G_{\cal O}} is a binomial complete intersection, for all {\cal O}. These graphs are called \text{CI}{\cal O} graphs. We prove that these graphs can be constructed recursively as clique-sums of cycles and/or complete graphs. We introduce the chorded-theta subgraphs and their transversal triangles. Also we establish that the \text{CI}{\cal O} graphs are determined by the property that each chorded-theta has a transversal triangle. As a consequence, we obtain that the tournaments hold this property. Finally we explicitly give the minimal forbidden induced subgraphs that characterize these graphs, these families of graphs are: prisms, pyramids, thetas and a particular family of wheels that we call \theta-partial wheels.
