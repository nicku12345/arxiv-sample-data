Finite (or Discrete) Fourier Transforms (FFT) are essential tools in engineering disciplines based on signal transmission, which is the case in most of them. FFT are related with circulant matrices, which can be viewed as group matrices of cyclic groups. In this regard, we introduce a generalization of the previous investigations to the case of finite groups, abelian or not. We make clear the points which were not recognized as underlying algebraic structures. Especially, all that appears in the FFT in engineering has been elucidated from the point of view of linear representations of finite groups. We include many worked-out examples for the readers in engineering disciplines.
