Let \mathfrak{g} be a simple Lie algebra defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p. Fix an integer r>1 and suppose that V_1,\ldots,V_r are irreducible closed subvarieties of \mathfrak{g}. Let C(V_1,\ldots,V_r) be the closed variety of all the pairwise commuting elements in V_1\times\cdots\times V_r. This paper studies the dimension and irreducibility of such varieties with various V_i in a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. In particular, we complete the problem for the case when V_i's are either \overline{\mathcal{O}_{\text{sub}}} the closure of the subregular orbit or \mathcal{N} the nilpotent cone of any rank two Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. A result on the dimension of these mixed commuting varieties is generalized for higher ranks. Finally, we apply our calculations to study properties of support varieties for a simple module over the r-th Frobenius kernels of G.
