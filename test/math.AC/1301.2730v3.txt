We study two variants of the following question: "Given two finitely generated subalgebras R_1, R_2 of C[x_1, \ldots, x_n], is their intersection also finitely generated?" We show that the smallest value of n for which there is a counterexample is 2 in the general case, and 3 in the case that R_1 and R_2 are integrally closed. We also explain the relation of this question to the problem of constructing algebraic compactifications of C^n and to the moment problem on semialgebraic subsets of R^n. The counterexample for the general case is a simple modification of a construction of Neena Gupta, whereas the counterexample for the case of integrally closed subalgebras uses the theory of normal analytic compactifications of C^2 via "key forms" of valuations centered at infinity.
