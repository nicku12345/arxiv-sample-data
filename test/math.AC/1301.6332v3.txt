Let D be an integrally closed domain with quotient field K and n a positive integer. We give a characterization of the polynomials in K[X] which are integer-valued over the set of matrices M_n(D) in terms of their divided differences. A necessary and sufficient condition on f\in K[X] to be integer-valued over M_n(D) is that, for each k less than n, the k-th divided difference of f is integral-valued on every subset of the roots of any monic polynomial over D of degree n. If in addition the intersection of the maximal ideals of finite index is (0) then it is sufficient to check the above conditions on subsets of the roots of monic irreducible polynomials of degree n, that is, conjugate integral elements of degree n over D.
