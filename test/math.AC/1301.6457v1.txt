We extend the classical length function to an ordinal-valued invariant on the class of all finite-dimensional Noetherian modules. We show how to calculate this combinatorial invariant by means of the fundamental cycle of the module, thus linking the lattice of submodules to homological properties of the module. Using this, we define on a module its canonical topology, in which every morphism is continuous.
