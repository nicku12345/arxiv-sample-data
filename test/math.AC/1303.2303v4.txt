Let L\subset \mathbb{Z}^n be a lattice and I_L=\langle x^{\bf u}-x^{\bf v}:\ {\bf u}-{\bf v}\in L\rangle be the corresponding lattice ideal in \Bbbk[x_1,\ldots, x_n], where \Bbbk is a field. In this paper we describe minimal binomial generating sets of I_L and their invariants. We use as a main tool a graph construction on equivalence classes of fibers of I_L. As one application of the theory developed we characterize binomial complete intersection lattice ideals, a longstanding open problem in the case of non-positive lattices.
