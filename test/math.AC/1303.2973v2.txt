There are several variations of the definition of log del Pezzo pairs in the literature. We define their suitable smooth models, and we show that they are the same. In particular, we obtain a characterization of smooth log del Pezzo pairs in terms of anticanonical models. As applications, we classify non-rational weak log canonical del Pezzo pairs, and we prove that every surface of globally F-regular type is of Fano type.
