We consider path ideals associated to special classes of posets such as tree posets and cycles. We express their property of being sequentially Cohen-Macaulay in terms of the underlying poset. Moreover, monomial ideals, which arise from the Luce-decomposable model in algebraic statistics, can be viewed as path ideals of certain posets. We study invariants of these so-called \emph{Luce-decomposable} monomial ideals for diamond posets and products of chains. In particular, for these classes of posets, we explicitly compute their Krull dimension, their projective dimension, their regularity and their Betti numbers.
