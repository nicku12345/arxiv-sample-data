Grassmann manifolds G_{k,n} are among the central objects in geometry and topology. The Borel picture of the mod 2 cohomology of G_{k,n} is given as a polynomial algebra modulo a certain ideal I_{k,n}. The purpose of this paper is to understand this cohomology via Gr\"obner bases. Reduced Gr\"obner bases for the ideals I_{k,n} are determined. An application of these bases is given by proving an immersion theorem for Grassmann manifolds G_{5,n}, which establishes new immersions for an infinite family of these manifolds.
