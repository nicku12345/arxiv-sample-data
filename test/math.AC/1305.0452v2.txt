This paper is devoted to integrability conditions for systems of linear difference and differential equations with difference parameters. It is shown that such a system is difference isomonodromic if and only if it is difference isomonodromic with respect to each parameter separately. Due to this result, it is no longer necessary to solve non-linear difference equations to verify isomonodromicity, which will improve efficiency of computation with these systems.
