This paper describes an algorithm for determining radii of convergence of power expansions for algebraic functions and the testing done to check it. Since the current methods for computing these series are iterative, standard methods for computing radii of convergence cannot in general, be used. However, relying on geometric properties of algebraic functions, convergence radii of these series can be determined precisely.
