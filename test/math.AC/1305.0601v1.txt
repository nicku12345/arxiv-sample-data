Let R be a commutative ring with unity and R^{+} be Z^*(R) be the additive group and the set of all non-zero zero-divisors of R, respectively. We denote by \mathbb{CAY}(R) the Cayley graph Cay(R^+,Z^*(R)). In this paper, we study \mathbb{CAY}(R). Among other results, it is shown that for every zero-dimensional non-local ring R, \mathbb{CAY}(R) is a connected graph of diameter 2. Moreover, for a finite ring R, we obtain the vertex connectivity and the edge connectivity of \mathbb{CAY}(R). We investigate rings R with perfect \mathbb{CAY}(R) as well. We also study Reg(\mathbb{CAY}(R)) the induced subgraph on the regular elements of R. This graph gives a family of vertex transitive graphs. We show that if R is a Noetherian ring and Reg(\mathbb{CAY}(R)) has no infinite clique, then R is finite. Furthermore, for every finite ring R, the clique number and the chromatic number of Reg(\mathbb{CAY}(R)) are determined.
