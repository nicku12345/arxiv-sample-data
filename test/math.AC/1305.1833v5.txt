Let (R,\mathfrak m) be a local ring of characteristic p>0 and M a finitely generated R-module. In this note we consider the limit: \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{\ell(H^0_{\mathfrak m}(F^n(M)))}{p^{n\dim R}}  where F(-) is the Peskine-Szpiro functor. A consequence of our main results shows that the limit always exists when R is excellent and has isolated singularity. Furthermore, if R is a complete intersection, then the limit is 0 if and only if the projective dimension of M is less than the Krull dimension of R. We exploit this fact to give a quick proof that if R is a complete intersection of dimension 3, then the Picard group of the punctured spectrum of R is torsion-free. Our results work quite generally for other homological functors and can be used to prove that certain limits recently studied by Brenner exist over projective varieties.
