Let X be a list of vectors that is totally unimodular. In a previous article the author proved that every real-valued function on the set of interior lattice points of the zonotope defined by X can be extended to a function on the whole zonotope of the form p(D)B_X in a unique way, where p(D) is a differential operator that is contained in the so-called internal \Pcal-space. In this paper we construct an explicit solution to this interpolation problem in terms of Todd operators. As a corollary we obtain a slight generalisation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula that relates the volume and the number of integer points in a smooth lattice polytope.
