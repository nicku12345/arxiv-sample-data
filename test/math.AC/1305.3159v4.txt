The pinched Veronese poset V^*_n is the poset with ground set consisting of all non-negative integer vectors of length n such that the sum of their coordinates is divisible by n with exception of the vector (1,...,1). For two vectors a and b in V^*_n we have a \leq b if and only if b - a belongs to the ground set of V^*_n.   We show that every interval in V^*_n is shellable for n at least 4. In order to obtain the result, we develop a new method for showing that a poset is shellable. This method differs from classical lexicographic shellability.   Shellability of intervals in V^*_n has consequences in commutative algebra. As a corollary we obtain a combinatorial proof of the fact that the pinched Veronese ring is Koszul for n \geq 4. (This also follows from a result by Conca, Herzog, Trung and Valla.)
