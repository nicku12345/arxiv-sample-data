Let R be a commutative ring with unity and Z(R) and {\rm Reg}(R) be the set of zero-divisors and non-zero zero-divisors of R, respectively. We denote by T(\Gamma(R)), the total graph of R, a simple graph with the vertex set R and two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if x+y\in Z(R). The induced subgraphs on Z(R) and {\rm Reg}(R) are denoted by Z(\Gamma(R)) and Reg(\Gamma(R)), respectively. These graphs were first introduced by D.F. Anderson and A. Badawi in 2008. In this paper, we prove the following result: let R be a finite ring and one of the following conditions hold: (i) The residue field of R of minimum size has even characteristic, (ii) Every residue field of R has odd characteristic and \frac{R}{J(R)} has no summand isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}_3\times \mathbb{Z}_3, then the chromatic number and clique number of T(\Gamma(R)) are equal to \max\{|\mathfrak{m}|\,:\, \mathfrak{m}\in {\rm Max}(R)\}. The same result holds for Z(\Gamma(R)). Moreover, if the residue field of R of minimum size has even characteristic or every residue field of R has odd characteristic, then we determine the chromatic number and clique number of Reg(\Gamma(R)) as well.
