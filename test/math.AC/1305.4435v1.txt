We describe a new software package for computing multiplier ideals in certain cases, including monomial ideals, monomial curves, generic determinantal ideals, and hyperplane arrangements. In these cases we take advantage of combinatorial formulas for multiplier ideals given by results of Howald, Thompson, and Johnson. The package uses Normaliz. It is available as a library for Macaulay2.
