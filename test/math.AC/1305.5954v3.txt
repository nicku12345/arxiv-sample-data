In this paper firstly, we generalize the concept of codismantlable graphs to hypergraphs and show that some special vertex decomposable hypergraphs are codismantlable. Then we generalize the concept of bouquet in graphs to hypergraphs to extend some combinatorial invariants of graphs about disjointness of a set of bouquets. We use these invariants to characterize the projective dimension of Stanley-Reisner ring of special hypergraphs in some sense.
