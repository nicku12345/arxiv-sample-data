Let R be a commutative ring and M be an R-module, and let Z(M) be the set of all zero-divisors on M. In 2008, D.F. Anderson and A. Badawi introduced the regular graph of R. In this paper, we generalize the regular graph of R to the \textit{M-regular graph} of R, denoted by M-Reg(\Gamma(R)). It is the undirected graph with all M-regular elements of R as vertices, and two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if x+y\in Z(M). The basic properties and possible structures of the M-Reg(\Gamma(R)) are studied. We determine the girth of the M-regular graph of R. Also, we provide some lower bounds for the independence number and the clique number of the M-Reg(\Gamma(R)). Among other results, we prove that for every Noetherian ring R and every finitely generated module M over R, if 2\notin Z(M) and the independence number of the M-Reg(\Gamma(R)) is finite, then R is finite.
