We characterize the irreducible representations of the general linear group GL(V) that have multiplicity 1 in the direct sum of all Schur modules of a given exterior power of V. These have come up in connection with the relations of the lower order minors of a generic matrix. We show that the minimal relations conjectured by Bruns, Conca and Varbaro are exactly those coming from partitions of single exterior type.
