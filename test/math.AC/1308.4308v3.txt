Let G be a simple graph on the vertex set \{1,\ldots,n\} with m edges. An algebraic object attached to G is the ideal P_{G} generated by diagonal 2-minors of an n \times n matrix of variables. In this paper we prove that if G is bipartite, then every initial ideal of P_{G} is generated by squarefree monomials of degree at most \left \lfloor{\frac{m+n+1}{2}} \right \rfloor. Furthermore, we completely characterize all connected graphs G for which P_{G} is the toric ideal associated to a finite simple graph. Finally we compute in certain cases the universal Gr{\"o}bner basis of P_{G}.
