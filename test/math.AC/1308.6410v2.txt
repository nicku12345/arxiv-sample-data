We relax the definition of a string algebra to also include infinite-dimensional algebras such as k[x,y]/(xy). Using the functorial filtration method, which goes back to Gelfand and Ponomarev, we show that finitely generated and artinian modules (and more generally finitely controlled and pointwise artinian modules) are classified in terms of string and band modules. This subsumes the known classifications of finite-dimensional modules for string algebras and of finitely generated modules for k[x,y]/(xy). Unlike in the finite-dimensional case, the words parameterizing string modules may be infinite.
