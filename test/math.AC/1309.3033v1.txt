Let K be an arbitrary field. Let n,d \ge 2 be positive integers. Let V(n,d) be the set of all lattice points \mathbf b = (b_1, ..., b_n) in {\mathbb N}^n such that \sum_{i=1}^n b_i = d. Let \Gamma = V(n,d) \setminus \{ \mathbf a \} for some element \mathbf a \in V(n,d). In this paper we prove that the semigroup ring K[\Gamma] is Koszul unless d \ge 3 and {\mathbf a} = (0, ...,0, 2, d-2) or one of its permutations. This generalizes results of Caviglia, Conca, and Tancer.
