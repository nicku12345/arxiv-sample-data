Normalization is a fundamental ring-theoretic operation; geometrically it resolves singularities in codimension one. Existing algorithmic methods for computing the normalization rely on a common recipe: successively enlarge the given ring in form an endomorphism ring of a certain (fractional) ideal until the process becomes stationary. While Vasconcelos' method uses the dual Jacobian ideal, Grauert-Remmert-type algorithms rely on so-called test ideals.   For algebraic varieties, one can apply such normalization algorithms globally, locally, or formal analytically at all points of the variety. In this paper, we relate the number of iterations for global Grauert-Remmert-type normalization algorithms to that of its local descendants.   We complement our results by an explicit study of ADE singularities. This includes the description of the normalization process in terms of value semigroups of curves. It turns out that the intermediate steps produce only ADE singularities and simple space curve singularities from the list of Fruehbis-Krueger.
