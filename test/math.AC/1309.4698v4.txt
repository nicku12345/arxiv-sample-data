Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Let X be a 2\times e matrix of linear forms over a polynomial ring k[\mathsf{x}_1, \ldots,\mathsf{x}_n] (where e,n\ge 1). We prove that the determinantal ring R = k[\mathsf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathsf{x}_n]/I_2(X) is Koszul if and only if in the Kronecker-Weierstrass normal form of X, the largest length of a nilpotent block is at most twice the smallest length of a scroll block. As an application, we classify rational normal scrolls whose all section rings by natural coordinates are Koszul. This result settles a conjecture due to Conca.
