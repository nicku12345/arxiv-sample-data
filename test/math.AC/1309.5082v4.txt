We investigate symbolic and regular powers of monomial ideals. For a square-free monomial ideal I in k[x_0, \ldots, x_n] we show I^{t(m+e-1)-e+r)} is a subset of M^{(t-1)(e-1)+r-1}(I^{(m)})^t for all positive integers m, t and r, where e is the big-height of I and M = (x_0, \ldots, x_n). This captures two conjectures (r=1 and r=e): one of Harbourne-Huneke and one of Bocci-Cooper-Harbourne. We also introduce the symbolic polyhedron of a monomial ideal and use this to explore symbolic powers of non-square-free monomial ideals.
