Let S = \mathbb{K}[x_1, \dots, x_n] be the polynomial ring over a field \mathbb{K}. In this paper we present a criterion for componentwise linearity of powers of monomial ideals. In particular, we prove that if a square-free monomial ideal I contains no variable and some power of I is componentwise linear, then I satisfies gcd condition. For a square-free monomial ideal I which contains no variable, we show that S/I is a Golod ring provided that for some integer s\geq 1, the ideal I^s has linear quotient with respect to a monomial order. We also provide a lower bound for some Betti numbers of powers of a square-free monomial ideal which is generated in a single degree.
