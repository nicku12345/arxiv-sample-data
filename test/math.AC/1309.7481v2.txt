Let G be a semisimple algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and P be a parabolic subgroup of G. Let M be a P-module and V be a P-stable closed subvariety of M. We show in this paper that if the varieties V and G\cdot M have rational singularities, and the induction functor R^i\text{ind}_P^G(-) satisfies certain vanishing condition then the variety G\cdot V has rational singularities. This generalizes the main result of Kempf in [Invent. Math., 37 (1976), no. 3]. As an application, we prove the property of having rational singularities for nilpotent commuting varieties over 3\times 3 matrices.
