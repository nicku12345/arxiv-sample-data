Let \L be a non-noetherian Krull domain which is the inverse limit of noetherian Krull domains \L_d and let M be a finitely generated \L-module which is the inverse limit of \L_d-modules M_d\,. Under certain hypotheses on the rings \L_d and on the modules M_d\,, we define a pro-characteristic ideal for M in \L, which should play the role of the usual characteristic ideals for finitely generated modules over noetherian Krull domains. We apply this to the study of Iwasawa modules (in particular of class groups) in a non-noetherian Iwasawa algebra \Z_p[[\Gal(\calf/F)]], where F is a function field of characteristic p and \Gal(\calf/F)\simeq\Z_p^\infty.
