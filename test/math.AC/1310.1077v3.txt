For an arbitrary ring R, the largest strong left quotient ring Q_l^s(R) of R and the strong left localization radical \glsR are introduced and their properties are studied in detail. In particular, it is proved that Q_l^s(Q_l^s(R))\simeq Q_l^s(R), \gll^s_{R/\glsR}=0 and a criterion is given for the ring  Q_l^s(R) to be a semisimple ring. There is a canonical homomorphism from the classical left quotient ring Q_{l, cl}(R) to Q_l^s(R) which is not an isomorphism, in general. The objects Q_l^s(R) and \gll^s_R are explicitly described for several large classes of rings (semiprime left Goldie ring, left Artinian rings, rings with left Artinian left quotient ring, etc).
