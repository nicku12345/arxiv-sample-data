Given a matrix factorization, we use the Atiyah class to give an algebraic Chern-Weil type construction to its Chern character; this allows us to realize the Chern character in an explicit way. It also generalizes the existing result to any smooth k-algebra Q (k a commutative ring containing \mathbb{Q}) and any f\in Q, which agrees with a recent result of Platt. We also study some basic properties of the Chern character.
