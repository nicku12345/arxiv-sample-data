In this paper we study the isomorphism classes of local, Artinian, Gorenstein k-algebras A whose maximal ideal M satisfies dim_k(M^3/M^4)=1 by means of Macaulay's inverse system generalizing a recent result by J. Elias and M.E. Rossi. Then we use such results in order to complete the description of the singular locus of the Gorenstein locus of the punctual Hilbert scheme of degree 11.
