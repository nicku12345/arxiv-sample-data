We study a series of real nonassociative algebras \mathbb{O}_{p,q} introduced in [5]. These algebras have a natural \mathbb{Z}_2^n-grading, where n=p+q, and they are characterized by a cubic form over the field \mathbb{Z}_2. We establish all the possible isomorphisms between the algebras \mathbb{O}_{p,q} preserving the structure of \mathbb{Z}_2^n-graded algebra. The classification table of \mathbb{O}_{p,q} is quite similar to that of the real Clifford algebras \mathrm{Cl}_{p,q}, the main difference is that the algebras \mathbb{O}_{n,0} and \mathbb{O}_{0,n} are exceptional.
