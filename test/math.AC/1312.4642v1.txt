There appeared not long ago a Reduction Formula for derived Hochschild cohomology, that has been useful e.g., in the study of Gorenstein maps and of rigidity w.r.t. semidualizing complexes. The formula involves the relative dualizing complex of a ring homomorphism, so brings out a connection between Hochschild homology and Grothendieck duality. The proof, somewhat ad hoc, uses homotopical considerations via a number of noncanonical projective and injective resolutions of differential graded objects. Recent efforts aim at more intrinsic approaches, hopefully upgradable to "higher" contexts--like bimodules over algebras in infinity-categories. This would lead to wider applicability, for example to ring spectra; and the methods might be globalizable, revealing some homotopical generalizations of aspects of Grothendieck duality. (The original formula has a geometric version, proved by completely different methods coming from duality theory.) A first step is to extend Hom-Tensor adjunction--adjoint associativity--to the infinity-category setting.
