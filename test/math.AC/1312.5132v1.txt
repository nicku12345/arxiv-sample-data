We give an intrinsic characterization of Cox sheaves on Krull schemes in terms of their valuative algebraic properties. We also provide a geometric characterization of their graded relative spectra in terms of good quotients of graded schemes, extending the work of Arzhantsev, Derenthal, Hausen and Laface on relative spectra of Cox sheaves on normal varieties. Moreover, we obtain an irredundant characterization of Cox rings which in turn produces a normality criterion for certain graded rings.
