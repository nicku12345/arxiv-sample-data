It is well known that multi-point Seshadri constants for a small number s of points in the projective plane are submaximal. It is predicted by the Nagata conjecture that their values are maximal for s\geq 9 points. Tackling the problem in the language of valuations one can make sense of s points for any positive real s\geq 1. We show somewhat surprisingly that a Nagata-type conjecture should be valid for s\geq 8+1/36 points and we compute explicitly all Seshadri constants (expressed here as the asymptotic maximal vanishing element) for s\leq 7+1/9.
