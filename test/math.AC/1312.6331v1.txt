Let I_1\subset I_2\subset\dots be an increasing sequence of ideals of the ring \Bbb Z[X], X=(x_1,\dots,x_n) and let I be their union. We propose an algorithm to compute the Gr\"obner base of I under the assumption that the Gr\"obner bases of the ideal \Bbb Q I of the ring \Bbb Q[X] and the the ideals I\otimes(\Bbb Z/m\Bbb Z) of the rings (\Bbb Z/m\Bbb Z)[X] are known.   Such an algorithmic problem arises, for example, in the construction of Markov and semi-Markov traces on cubic Hecke algebras.
