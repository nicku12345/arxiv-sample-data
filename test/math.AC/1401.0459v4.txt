Let R be a commutative ring with an identity different from zero and n be a positive integer. Anderson and Badawi, in their paper on n-absorbing ideals, define a proper ideal I of a commutative ring R to be an n-absorbing ideal of R, if whenever x_1 \cdots x_{n+1} \in I for x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1} \in R, then there are n of the x_i's whose product is in I and conjecture that \omega_{R[X]}(I[X])=\omega_R(I) for any ideal I of an arbitrary ring R, where \omega_R(I)= \min \{n\colon\text{I is an n-absorbing ideal of R}\}. In the present paper, we use content formula techniques to prove that their conjecture is true, if one of the following conditions hold: The ring R is a Pr\"ufer domain. The ring R is a Gaussian ring such that its additive group is torsion-free. The additive group of the ring R is torsion-free and I is a radical ideal of R.
