Let R be a commutative ring. A not necessarily commutative R-algebra A is called futile if it has only finitely many R-subalgebras. In this article we relate the notion of futility to familiar properties of rings and modules. We do this by first reducing to the case where A is commutative. Then we refine the description of commutative futile algebras from Dobbs, Picavet and Picavet-L'hermite.
