Let J_r denote an r\times r matrix over a finite field F with minimal and characteristic polynomials (t-1)^r. Suppose r\leq s. It is not hard to show that the Jordan canonical form of J_r\otimes J_s is similar to J_{\lambda_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus J_{\lambda_r} where \lambda_1\geq\cdots\geq\lambda_r>0 and \sum_{i=1}^r\lambda_i=rs. The partition \lambda(r,s,p):=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_r) of rs, which depends only on r,s and the characteristic p of F, has many applications including to the study of algebraic groups. We prove new periodicity and duality results for \lambda(r,s,p) that depend on the smallest p-power exceeding r. This generalizes results of J. A. Green, B. Srinivasan, and others which depend on the smallest p-power exceeding the (potentially large) integer s. We show that for fixed r we can construct a finite table allowing the computation of \lambda(r,s,p) for all s with s\geq r, and all primes p. This generalizes work of K-i. Iima and R. Iwamatsu.
