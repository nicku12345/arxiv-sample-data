For a finite index sublattice L of the root lattice A_{n}, we construct a deterministic algorithm to deform the lattice ideal I_L to a nearby generic lattice ideal, answering a question posed by Miller and Sturmfels. Our algorithm is based on recent results of Perkinson, Perlman and Wilmes concerning commutative algebraic aspects of chip firing on directed graphs. As an application of our deformation algorithm, we construct a cellular resolution of the lattice ideal I_L by degenerating the Scarf complex of its deformation.
