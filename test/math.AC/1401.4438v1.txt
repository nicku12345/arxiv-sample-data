Let D be an integrally closed domain with quotient field K. Let A be a torsion-free D-algebra that is finitely generated as a D-module. For every a in A we consider its minimal polynomial \mu_a(X)\in D[X], i.e. the monic polynomial of least degree such that \mu_a(a)=0. The ring {\rm Int}_K(A) consists of polynomials in K[X] that send elements of A back to A under evaluation. If D has finite residue rings, we show that the integral closure of {\rm Int}_K(A) is the ring of polynomials in K[X] which map the roots in an algebraic closure of K of all the \mu_a(X), a\in A, into elements that are integral over D. The result is obtained by identifying A with a D-subalgebra of the matrix algebra M_n(K) for some n and then considering polynomials which map a matrix to a matrix integral over D. We also obtain information about polynomially dense subsets of these rings of polynomials.
