We give model theoretic criteria for \exists \forall and \forall \exists- formulas in the ring language to define uniformly the valuation rings \mathcal{O} of models (K, \mathcal{O}) of an elementary theory \Sigma of henselian valued fields. As one of the applications we obtain the existence of an \exists \forall-formula defining uniformly the valuation rings \mathcal{O} of valued henselian fields (K, \mathcal{O}) whose residue class field k is finite, pseudo-finite, or hilbertian. We also obtain \forall \exists-formulas \varphi_2 and \varphi_4 such that \varphi_2 defines uniformly k[[t]] in k((t)) whenever k is finite or the function field of a real or complex curve, and \varphi_4 does the job if k is any number field.
