We characterize all graphs whose binomial edge ideals have pure resolutions. Moreover, we introduce a new switching of graphs which does not change some algebraic invariants of graphs, and using this, we study the linear strand of the binomial edge ideals for some classes of graphs. Also, we pose a conjecture on the linear strand of such ideals for every graph.
