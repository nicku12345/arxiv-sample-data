We develop algorithms to compute the differential Galois group G associated to a parameterized second-order homogeneous linear differential equation of the form \[ \tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} Y + r_1 \tfrac{\partial}{\partial x} Y + r_0 Y = 0, \] where the coefficients r_1, r_0 \in F(x) are rational functions in x with coefficients in a partial differential field F of characteristic zero. Our work relies on the procedure developed by Dreyfus to compute G under the assumption that r_1 = 0. We show how to complete this procedure to cover the cases where r_1 \neq 0, by reinterpreting a classical change of variables procedure in Galois-theoretic terms.
