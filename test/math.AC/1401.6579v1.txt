Let R be a commutative ring with a non-zero identity and \mathfrak{J}_R be its Jacobson graph. We show that if R and R' are finite commutative rings, then \mathfrak{J}_R\cong\mathfrak{J}_{R'} if and only if |J(R)|=|J(R')| and R/J(R)\cong R'/J(R'). Also, for a Jacobson graph \mathfrak{J}_R, we obtain the structure of group \mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{J}_R) of all automorphisms of \mathfrak{J}_R and prove that under some conditions two semi-simple rings R and R' are isomorphic if and only if \mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{J}_R)\cong\mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{J}_{R'}).
