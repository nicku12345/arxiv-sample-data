Let k be a regular ring, and let A,B be essentially finite type k-algebras. For any functor F:{D}(A)\times\dots\times{D}(A)\to{D}(B) between their derived categories, we define its twist F^{!}:{D}(A)\times\dots\times{D}(A)\to{D}(B) with respect to dualizing complexes, generalizing Grothendieck's construction of f^{!}. We show that relations between functors are preserved between their twists, and deduce that various relations hold between derived Hochschild (co)-homology and the f^{!} functor. We also deduce that the set of isomorphism classes of dualizing complexes over a ring (or a scheme) form a group with respect to derived Hochschild cohomology, and that the twisted inverse image functor is a group homomorphism.
