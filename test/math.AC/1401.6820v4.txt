The paper studies the dimensions of irreducible components of commuting varieties of (restricted) nilpotent r-tuples in a classical Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} defined over an algebraically closed field k. As applications, we obtain some new results on the structure of the (even) cohomology ring of Frobenius kernels G_r for each r\ge 1, where G is the simply connected, simple algebraic group such that \text{Lie}(G)=\mathfrak{g}. Explicit calculations for rank two groups are also presented.
