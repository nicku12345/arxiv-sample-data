We investigate the relations between the syzygies of the Jacobian ideal of the defining equation for a plane curve C and the stability of the sheaf of logarithmic vector fields along C, the freeness of the divisor C and the Torelli properties of C (in the sense of Dolgachev-Kapranov).   We show in particular that curves with a small number of nodes and cusps are Torelli in this sense.
