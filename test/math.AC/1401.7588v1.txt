In this paper we study the distribution of the sequence (\alpha \zeta^{n})_{n\geq 1} mod 1, where \alpha,\zeta are fixed positive real numbers, with special focus on the accumulation point 0. For this purpose we introduce approximation constants \underline{\sigma}(\alpha,\zeta),\overline{\sigma}(\alpha, \zeta) and study their properties in dependence of \alpha,\zeta, distinguishing in particular the cases of Pisot numbers, algebraic non Pisot numbers and transcendental values of \alpha as well as \zeta.
