We develop a theory of ``ad hoc'' Chern characters for twisted matrix factorizations associated to a scheme X, a line bundle {\mathcal L}, and a regular global section W \in \Gamma(X, {\mathcal L}).   As an application, we establish the vanishing, in certain cases, of h_c^R(M,N), the higher Herbrand difference, and, \eta_c^R(M,N), the higher codimensional analogue of Hochster's theta pairing, where R is a complete intersection of codimension c with isolated singularities and M and N are finitely generated R-modules. Specifically, we prove such vanishing if R = Q/(f_1, \dots, f_c) has only isolated singularities, Q is a smooth k-algebra, k is a field of characteristic 0, the f_i's form a regular sequence, and c \geq 2.
