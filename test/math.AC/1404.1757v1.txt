In this paper we study graded Betti numbers of any nondegenerate 3-regular algebraic set X in a projective space \mathbb P^{n}. More concretely, via Generic initial ideals (Gins) method we mainly consider `tailing' Betti numbers, whose homological index is not less than \mathrm{codim}(X,\mathbb P^{n}). For this purpose, we first introduce a key definition `\mathrm{ND(1)} property', which provides a suitable ground where one can generalize the concepts such as `being nondegenerate' or `of minimal degree' from the case of varieties to the case of more general closed subschemes and give a clear interpretation on the tailing Betti numbers. Next, we recall basic notions and facts on Gins theory and we analyze the generation structure of the reverse lexicographic (rlex) Gins of 3-regular \mathrm{ND(1)} subschemes. As a result, we present exact formulae for these tailing Betti numbers, which connect them with linear normality of general linear sections of X\cap \Lambda with a linear subspace \Lambda of dimension at least \mathrm{codim}(X,\mathbb P^{n}). Finally, we consider some applications and related examples.
