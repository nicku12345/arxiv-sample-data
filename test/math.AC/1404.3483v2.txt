The class of equidimensional polymatroidal ideals are studied. In particular, we show that an unmixed polymatroidal ideal is connected in codimension one if and only if it is Cohen-Macaulay. Especially a matroidal ideal is connected in codimension one precisely when it is a squarefree Veronese ideal. As a consequence we indicate that for polymatroidal ideals, the Serre's condition (S_n) for some n\geq 2 is equivalent to Cohen-Macaulay property. We also give a classification of generalized Cohen-Macaulay polymatroidal ideals.
