In this paper we define an equivalence relation on the set of all x_{J} in order to form a basis for a new descent algebra of Weyl groups of type A_{n}. By means of this, we construct a new commutative and semi-simple descent algebra of Weyl groups of type A_{n} generated by equivalence classes arising from this equivalence relation.
