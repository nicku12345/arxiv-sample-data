Let C \langle \boldsymbol{t} \rangle be the differential field generated by l differential indeterminates \boldsymbol{t}=(t_1, \dots, t_l) over an algebraically closed field C of characteristic zero. In this article we present an explicit linear parameter differential equation over C \langle \boldsymbol{t} \rangle with differential Galois group \mathrm{SL}_{l+1}(C) and show that it is a generic equation in the following sense: If F is an algebraically closed differential field with constants C and E/F is a Picard-Vessiot extension with differential Galois group H(C) \subseteq \mathrm{SL}_{l+1}(C), then a specialization of our equation defines a Picard-Vessiot extension differentially isomorphic to E/F.
