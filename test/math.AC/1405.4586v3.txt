Cohen-Macaulayness, unmixedness, the structure of the canonical module and the stability of the Hilbert function of algebraic residual intersections are studied in this paper. Some conjectures about these properties are established for large classes of residual intersections without restricting local number of generators of the ideals involved. A family of approximation complexes for residual intersections is constructed to determine the above properties. Moreover some general properties of the symmetric powers of quotient ideals are determined which were not known even for special ideals with a small number of generators. Acyclicity of a prime case of these complexes is shown to be equivalent to find a common annihilator for higher Koszul homologies. So that, a tight relation between residual intersections and the uniform annihilator of positive Koszul homologies is unveiled that sheds some light on their structure.
