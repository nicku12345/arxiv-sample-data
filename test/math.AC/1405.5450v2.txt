Let J\varsubsetneq I be two monomial ideals of the polynomial ring S=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]. In this paper, we provide two lower bounds for the Stanley depth of I/J. On the one hand, we introduce the notion of lcm number of I/J, denoted by l(I/J), and prove that the inequality {\rm sdepth}(I/J)\geq n-l(I/J)+1 hold. On the other hand, we show that {\sdepth}(I/J)\geq n-\dim L_{I/J}, where \dim L_{I/J} denotes the order dimension of the lcm lattice of I/J. We show that I and S/I satisfy Stanley's conjecture, if either the lcm number of I or the order dimension of the lcm lattice of I is small enough. Among other results, we also prove that the Stanley--Reisner ideal of a vertex decomposable simplicial complex satisfies Stanley's conjecture.
