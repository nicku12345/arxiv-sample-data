Given a zero-dimensional Gorenstein algebra \mathbb{B} and two syzygies between two elements f_1,f_2\in\mathbb{B}, one constructs a double complex of \mathbb{B}-modules, {\cal G}_\mathbb{B}, called the small Gobelin. We describe an inductive procedure to construct the even and odd hyperhomologies of this complex. For high degrees, the difference \dim \mathbb{H}_{j+2}({\cal G}_\mathbb{B}) - \dim\mathbb{H}_j({\cal G}_\mathbb{B}) is constant, but possibly with a different value for even and odd degrees. We describe two flags of ideals in \mathbb{B} which codify the above differences of dimension. The motivation to study this double complex comes from understanding the tangency condition between a vector field and a complete intersection, and invariants constructed in the zero locus of the vector field \hbox{Spec}(\mathbb{B}).
