Let \mathcal{S} be a finite semigroup, and let E(\mathcal{S}) be the set of all idempotents of \mathcal{S}. Gillam, Hall and Williams proved in 1972 that every \mathcal{S}-valued sequence T of length at least |\mathcal{S}|-|E(\mathcal{S})|+1 is not (strongly) idempotent-product free, in the sense that it contains a nonempty subsequence the product of whose terms, in their natural order in T, is an idempotent, which affirmed a question of Erd\H{o}s. They also showed that the value |\mathcal{S}|-|E(\mathcal{S})|+1 is best possible.   Here, motivated by Gillam, Hall and Williams' work, we determine the structure of the idempotent-product free sequences of length |\mathcal{S}\setminus E(\mathcal{S})| when the semigroup \mathcal{S} (not necessarily finite) satisfies |\mathcal{S}\setminus E(\mathcal{S})| is finite, and we introduce a couple of structural constants for semigroups that reduce to the classical Davenport constant in the case of finite abelian groups.
