We study the series of complex nonassociative algebras On and real nonassociative algebras O_{p,q} introduced in [10]. These algebras generalize the classical algebras of octonions and Clifford algebras. The algebras O_{n} and O_{p,q} with p + q = n have a natural Z_n^2-grading, and they are characterized by cubic forms over the field Z_2. We establish a periodicity for the algebras O_{n} and O_{p,q} similar to that of the Clifford algebras Cln and Cl_{p,q}.
