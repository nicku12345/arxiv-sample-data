We analyse the Gorenstein locus of the Hilbert scheme of d points on \mathbb{P}^n i.e. the open subscheme parameterising zero-dimensional Gorenstein subschemes of \mathbb{P}^n of degree d. We give new sufficient criteria for smoothability and smoothness of points of the Gorenstein locus. In particular we prove that this locus is irreducible when d\leq 13 and find its components when d = 14. The proof is relatively self-contained and it does not rely on a computer algebra system. As a by--product, we give equations of the fourth secant variety to the d-th Veronese reembedding of \mathbb{P}^n for d\geq 4.
