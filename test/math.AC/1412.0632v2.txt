Using the minors in Hessian matrices, we introduce new graded algebras associated to a homogeneous polynomial. When the associated projective hypersurface has isolated singularities, these algebras are related to some new local algebras associated to isolated hypersurface singularities, which generalize their Tjurina algebras. One consequence of our results is a new way to determine the number of weighted homogeneous singularities of such a hypersurface.
