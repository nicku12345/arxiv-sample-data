Let k be a field of arbitrary characteristic. Nakai (1978) proved a structure theorem for k-domains admitting a nontrivial locally finite iterative higher derivation when k is algebraically closed. In this paper, we generalize Nakai's theorem to cover the case where k is not algebraically closed. As a consequence, we obtain a cancellation theorem of the following form: Let A and A' be finitely generated k-domains with A[x]\simeq _kA'[x]. If A and \bar{k}\otimes _kA are UFDs and \mathop{\rm trans.deg}\nolimits_kA=2, then we have A\simeq _kA'. This generalizes the cancellation theorem of Crachiola (2009).
