Let P_n=k[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n] be the polynomial algebra over a field k of characteristic zero in the variables x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n and \mathscr{L}_n be the left-symmetric algebra of all derivations of P_n \cite{Dzhuma99,UU2014-1}. Using the language of \mathscr{L}_n, for every derivation D\in \mathscr{L}_n we define the associative algebra A_D, the Lie algebra L_D, and the left-symmetric algebra \mathscr{L}_D related to the study of the Jacobian Conjecture. For every derivation D\in \mathscr{L}_n there is a unique n-tuple F=(f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_n) of elements of P_n such that D=D_F=f_1\partial_1+f_2\partial_2+\ldots+f_n\partial_n. In this case, using an action of the Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions \mathrm{NSymm} on P_n, we show that these algebras are closely related to the description of coefficients of the formal inverse to the polynomial endomorphism X+tF, where X=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) and t is an independent parameter.   We prove that the Jacobian matrix J(F) is nilpotent if and only if all right powers D_F^{[r]} of D_F in \mathscr{L}_n have zero divergence. In particular, if J(F) is nilpotent then D_F is right nilpotent.   We discuss some advantages and shortcomings of these algebras and formulate some open questions.
