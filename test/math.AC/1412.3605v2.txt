The aim of this paper is to study jumping numbers and multiplier ideals of any ideal in a two-dimensional local ring with a rational singularity. In particular we reveal which information encoded in a multiplier ideal determines the next jumping number. This leads to an algorithm to compute sequentially the jumping numbers and the whole chain of multiplier ideals in any desired range. As a consequence of our method we develop the notion of jumping divisor that allows to describe the jump between two consecutive multiplier ideals. In particular we find a unique minimal jumping divisor that is studied extensively.
