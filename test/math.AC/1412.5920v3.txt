We present a simple method to obtain information regarding the connectivity of the 1-skeleta of a wide family of simplicial complexes through bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of their Stanley-Reisner rings. In this way we generalize and unify two results on connectivity: one by Balinsky and Barnette, one by Athanasiadis. In particular, if \Delta is a simplicial d-pseudomanifold, and s is the highest integer such that there is an s-dimensional simplex not contained in \Delta, but such that its boundary is, then the 1-skeleton of \Delta is \left\lceil \frac{(s+1)d}{s} \right\rceil-connected. We also show that this bound on the connectivity is tight.
