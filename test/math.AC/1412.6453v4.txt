Many results are known about test ideals and F-singularities for {\bf Q}-Gorenstein rings. In this paper we generalize many of these results to the case when the symbolic Rees algebra O_X \oplus O_X(-K_X) \oplus O_X(-2K_X) \oplus ... is finitely generated (or more generally, in the log setting for -K_X - \Delta). In particular, we show that the F-jumping numbers of \tau(X, a^t) are discrete and rational. We show that test ideals \tau(X) can be described by alterations as in Blickle-Schwede-Tucker (and hence show that splinters are strongly F-regular in this setting -- recovering a result of Singh). We demonstrate that multiplier ideals reduce to test ideals under reduction modulo p when the symbolic Rees algebra is finitely generated. We prove that Hartshorne-Speiser-Lyubeznik-Gabber type stabilization still holds. We also show that test ideals satisfy global generation properties in this setting.
