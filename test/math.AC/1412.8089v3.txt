A pair of elements a,b in an integral domain R is an idempotent pair if either a(1-a) \in bR, or b(1-b) \in aR. R is said to be a PRINC domain if all the ideals generated by an idempotent pair are principal. We show that in an order R of a Dedekind domain every regular prime ideal can be generated by an idempotent pair; moreover, if R is PRINC, then its integral closure, which is a Dedekind domain, is PRINC, too. Hence, a Dedekind domain is PRINC if and only if it is a PID. Furthermore, we show that the only imaginary quadratic orders \mathbb Z[\sqrt{-d}], d > 0 square-free, that are PRINC and not integrally closed, are for d=3,7.
