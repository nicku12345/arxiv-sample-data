Let (R, \mathfrak{m}) be a noetherian local ring, M a separated R-module (i.e. \bigcap\limits_{n\geq 1}\mathfrak{m}^n M = 0) and \widehat{M} = \lim\limits_{\leftarrow} M/\mathfrak{m}^n M its completion. Generally, M is not pure in \widehat{M} and \widehat{M} is not pure-injective. But if M is totally separated, i.e. X\underset{R}{\otimes} M is separated for all finitely generated R-modules X, the situation improves: In this case, M is pure in \widehat{M} and, under additional conditions, \widehat{M} is even pure-injective, e.g. if M\cong X^{(I)} holds with X finitely generated or M \cong\coprod_{i=1}^{\infty} R/\mathfrak{m}^i. In section 2, we investigate the question under which conditions both M and \widehat{M} are totally separated and establish a close connection to the class of strictly pure-essential extensions. In section 3, we replace the completion \widehat{M} in the case M = \coprod_{i\in I}M_i with the \mathfrak{m}-adic closure A of M in P = \prod_{i\in I} M_i, i.e. with A = \bigcap_{n \geq 1}(M + \mathfrak{m}^n P). We give criteria so that A/M is radical and show that this always holds in the countable case M = \coprod_{i=1}^{\infty} M_i. Finally, we deal with the case that A is even totally separated and additionally determine the coassociated prime ideals of A/M.
