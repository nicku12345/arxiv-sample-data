Let \k be a field and let A be a standard \mathbb{N}-graded \k-algebra. Using numerical information of some invariants in the primary decomposition of 0 in A, namely the so called dimension filtration, we associate a bivariate polynomial \BW(A;t,w), that we call the Bj\"{o}rner--Wachs polynomial, to A.   It is shown that the Bj\"{o}rner--Wachs polynomial is an algebraic counterpart of the combinatorially defined h-triangle of finite simplicial complexes introduced by Bj\"{o}rner \& Wachs. We provide a characterisation of sequentially Cohen--Macaulay algebras in terms of the effect of the reverse lexicographic generic initial ideal on the Bj\"{o}rner--Wachs polynomial. More precisely, we show that a graded algebra is sequentially Cohen--Macaulay if and only if it has a stable Bj\"{o}rner--Wachs polynomial under passing to the reverse lexicographic generic initial ideal. We conclude by discussing connections with the Hilbert series of local cohomology modules.
