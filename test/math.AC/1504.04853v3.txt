This work concerns the linearity defect of a module M over a noetherian local ring R, introduced by Herzog and Iyengar in 2005, and denoted by \text{ld}_R M. Roughly speaking, \text{ld}_R M is the homological degree beyond which the minimal free resolution of M is linear. In the paper, it is proved that for any ideal I in a regular local ring R and for any finitely generated R-module M, each of the sequences (\text{ld}_R (I^nM))_n and (\text{ld}_R (M/I^nM))_n is eventually constant. The first statement follows from a more general result about the eventual constancy of the sequence (\text{ld}_R C_n)_n where C is a finitely generated graded module over a standard graded algebra over R. The second statement follows from the first together with a result of Avramov on small homomorphisms.
