We show that the Golod property of a Stanley-Reisner ring can depend on the characteristic of the base field. More precisely, for every finite set T of prime numbers we construct simplicial complexes \Delta and \Gamma, such that \mathbb{K}[\Delta] is Golod exactly in the characteristics in T and \mathbb{K}[\Gamma] is Golod exactly in the characteristics not in T. Along the way, we show that a one-dimensional simplicial complex is Golod if and only if it is chordal.
