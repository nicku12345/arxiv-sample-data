For a scheme of fat points Z defined by the saturated ideal \mathcal{I}_Z, the regularity index computes the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the Cohen-Macaulay ring R/\mathcal{I}_Z. For points in " general position" we improve the bound for the regularity index computed by Segre for \mathbb {P}^2 and generalised by Catalisano, Trung and Valla for \mathbb {P}^n. Moreover, we prove that the generalised Segre's bound conjectured by Fatabbi and Lorenzini holds for n+3 arbitrary points in \mathbb {P}^n. We propose a modification of Segre's conjecture for arbitrary points and we discuss some evidences.
