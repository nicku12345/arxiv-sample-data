This paper studies critical ideals of graphs with twin vertices, which are vertices with the same neighbors. A pair of such vertices are called replicated if they are adjacent, and duplicated, otherwise. Critical ideals of graphs having twin vertices have good properties and show regular patterns. Given a graph G=(V,E) and {\bf d}\in \mathbb{Z}^{|V|}, let G^{\bf d} be the graph obtained from G by duplicating {\bf d}_v times or replicating -{\bf d}_v times the vertex v when {\bf d}_v>0 or {\bf d}_v<0, respectively. Moreover, given \delta\in \{0,1,-1\}^{|V|}, let \[ \mathcal{T}_{\delta}(G)=\{G^{\bf d}: {\bf d}\in \mathbb{Z}^{|V|} \text{ such that } {\bf d}_v=0 \text{ if and only if }\delta_v=0 \text{ and } {\bf d}_v\delta_v>0 \text{ otherwise}\} \] be the set of graphs sharing the same pattern of duplication or replication of vertices. More than one half of the critical ideals of a graph in \mathcal{T}_{\delta}(G) can be determined by the critical ideals of G. The algebraic co-rank of a graph G is the maximum integer i such that the i-{\it th} critical ideal of G is trivial. We show that the algebraic co-rank of any graph in \mathcal{T}_{\delta}(G) is equal to the algebraic co-rank of G^{\delta}. For a large enough {\bf d}\in \mathbb{Z}^{V(G)}, we show that the critical ideals of G^{\bf d} have similar behavior to the critical ideals of the disjoint union of G and some set \{K_{n_v}\}_{\{v\in V(G)| d_v<0\}} of complete graphs and some set \{T_{n_v}\}_{\{v\in V(G) \, |\, {\bf d}_v>0\}} of trivial graphs. Additionally, we pose important conjectures on the distribution of the algebraic co-rank of the graphs with twins vertices. These conjectures imply that twin-free graphs have a large algebraic co-rank, meanwhile a graph having small algebraic co-rank has at least one pair of twin vertices.
