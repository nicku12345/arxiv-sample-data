We study the c-vectors, g-vectors, and F-polynomials for generalized cluster algebras satisfying a normalization condition and a power condition recovering classical recursions and separation of additions formulas. We establish a relationship between the c-vectors, g-vectors, and F-polynomials of such a generalized cluster algebra and its (left- and right-) companion cluster algebras. Our main result states that the cluster variables and coefficients of the (left- and right-) companion cluster algebras can be recovered via a specialization of the F-polynomials.
