Recent developments of affine algebraic geometry, especially the theory of open algebraic surfaces, provide means to systematically explore geometric and topological properties of polynomials in two variables. Nevertheless, there is one unsurmountable problem remained even in the case of two variables, which has been unsolved since 1939, that is the Jacobian Conjecture. These are notes for author's lectures on the geometry and topology of polynomials and the Jacobian Conjecture delivered at the l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux I and at Osaka University in 2003.
