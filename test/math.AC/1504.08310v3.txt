We study the orbits and polynomial invariants of certain affine action of the super Weyl groupoid of Lie superalgebra \mathfrak {gl}(n,m), depending on a parameter. We show that for generic values of the parameter all the orbits are finite and separated by certain explicitly given invariants. We also describe explicitly the special set of parameters, for which the algebra of invariants is not finitely generated and does not separate the orbits, some of which are infinite.
