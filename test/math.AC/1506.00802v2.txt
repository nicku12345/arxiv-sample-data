The order polytope \mathcal{O}(P) and the chain polytope \mathcal{C}(P) associated to a partially ordered set P are studied. In this paper, we introduce the convex polytope \Gamma(\mathcal{O}(P), -\mathcal{C}(Q)) which is the convex hull of \mathcal{O}(P) \cup (-\mathcal{C}(Q)), where both P and Q are partially ordered sets with |P|=|Q|=d. It will be shown that \Gamma(\mathcal{O}(P), -\mathcal{C}(Q)) is a normal and Gorenstein Fano polytope by using the theory of reverse lexicographic squarefree initial ideals of toric ideals.
