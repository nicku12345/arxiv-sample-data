In this paper, we give a complete description of the associated primes of every power of the edge ideal in terms of generalized ear decompositions of the graph. This result establishes a surprising relationship between two seemingly unrelated notions of Commutative Algebra and Combinatorics. It covers all previous major results in this topic and has several interesting consequences.
