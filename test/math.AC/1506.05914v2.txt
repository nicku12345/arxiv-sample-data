We compute the minimal and the maximal bound on the number of generators of a minimal smooth monomial Togliatti system of forms of degree d in n+1 variables, for any d\ge 2 and n\geq 2. We classify the Togliatti systems with number of generators reaching the lower bound or close to the lower bound. We then prove that if n=2 (resp n=2,3) all range between the lower and upper bound is covered, while if n\geq 3 (resp. n\ge 4) there are gaps if we only consider smooth minimal Togliatti systems (resp. if we avoid the smoothness hypothesis). We finally analyze for n=2 the Mumford-Takemoto stability of the syzygy bundle associated to smooth monomial Togliatti systems.
