We deal with a generalization of a Theorem of P. Gordan and M. Noether on hypersurfaces with vanishing (first) Hessian. We prove that for any given N\geq 3, d \geq 3 and 2\leq k < \frac{d}{2} there are infinitely many irreducible hypersurfaces X = V(f)\subset \mathbb{P}^N, of degree \operatorname{deg}(f)=d, not cones and such that their Hessian determinant of order k, \operatorname{hess}^k_f, vanishes identically. The vanishing of higher Hessians is closely related with the Strong (or Weak) Lefschetz property for standard graded Artinian Gorenstein algebra, as pointed out firstly in \cite{Wa1} and later in \cite{MW}. As an application we construct for each pair (N.d) \neq (3,3),(3,4) infinitely many standard graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras A, of codimension N+1 \geq 4 and with socle degree d \geq 3 which do not satisfy the Strong Lefschetz property, failing at an arbitrary step k with 2\leq k<\frac{d}{2}. We also prove that for each pair (N,d), N \geq 3 and d \geq 3 except (3,3), (3,4), (3,6) and (4,4) there are infinitely many standard graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras of codimension N+1, with socle degree d, with unimodal Hilbert vectors which do not satisfy the Weak Lefschetz property.
