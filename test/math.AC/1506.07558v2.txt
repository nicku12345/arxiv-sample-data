We use supernatural bundles to build GL-equivariant resolutions supported on the diagonal of P^n x P^n, in a way that extends Beilinson's resolution of the diagonal. We thus obtain results about supernatural bundles that largely parallel known results about exceptional collections. We apply this construction to Boij-S\"oderberg decompositions of cohomology tables of vector bundles, yielding a proof of concept for the idea that those positive rational decompositions should admit meaningful categorifications.
