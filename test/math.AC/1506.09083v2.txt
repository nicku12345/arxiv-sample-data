Let D be a domain with fraction field K, and let M_n(D) be the ring of n \times n matrices with entries in D. The ring of integer-valued polynomials on the matrix ring M_n(D), denoted {\rm Int}_K(M_n(D)), consists of those polynomials in K[x] that map matrices in M_n(D) back to M_n(D) under evaluation. It has been known for some time that {\rm Int}_{\mathbb{Q}}(M_n(\mathbb{Z})) is not integrally closed. However, it was only recently that an example of a polynomial in the integral closure of {\rm Int}_{\mathbb{Q}}(M_n(\mathbb{Z})) but not in the ring itself appeared in the literature, and the published example is specific to the case n=2. In this paper, we give a construction that produces polynomials that are integral over {\rm Int}_K(M_n(D)) but are not in the ring itself, where D is a Dedekind domain with finite residue fields and n \geq 2 is arbitrary. We also show how our general example is related to P-sequences for {\rm Int}_K(M_n(D)) and its integral closure in the case where D is a discrete valuation ring.
