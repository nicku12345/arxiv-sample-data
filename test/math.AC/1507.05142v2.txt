In this paper, we conjecture an extension of the Hilbert basis theorem and the finite generation of invariants to commutative algebras in symmetric finite tensor categories over fields of positive characteristic. We prove the conjecture in the case of semisimple categories and more generally in the case of categories with fiber functors to the characteristic p > 0 Verlinde category of SL_{2}. We also construct a symmetric finite tensor category \sVec_{2} over fields of characteristic 2 and show that it is a candidate for the category of supervector spaces in this characteristic. We further show that \sVec_{2} does not fiber over the characteristic 2 Verlinde category of SL_{2} and then prove the conjecture for any category fibered over \sVec_{2}.
