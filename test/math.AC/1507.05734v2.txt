Let R be a smooth affine algebra over an infinite perfect field k. Let I\subset R be an ideal, \omega_I:(R/I)^n\to I/I^2 a surjective homomorphism and Q_{2n}\subset \mathbb{A}^{2n+1} be the smooth quadric defined by the equation \sum x_iy_i=z(1-z). We associate with the pair (I,\omega_I) an obstruction in the set of homomorphisms \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{A}^1}(\mathrm{Spec}(R),Q_{2n}) up to naive homotopy whose vanishing is sufficient for \omega_I to lift to a surjection R^n\to I. Subsequently, we prove that the obstruction vanishes in case R=k[T_1,\ldots,T_m] for m\in \mathbb{N} where k is an infinite perfect field having characteristic different from 2 thus resolving an old conjecture of M.
