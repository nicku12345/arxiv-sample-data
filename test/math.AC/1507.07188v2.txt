Let I be a monomial ideal in the polynomial ring S generated by elements of degree at most d. In this paper, it is shown that, if the i-th syzygy of I has no element of degrees j, \ldots, j+(d-1) (where j \geq i+d), then (i+1)-syzygy of I does not have any element of degree j+d. Then we give several applications of this result, including an alternative proof for Green-Lazarsfeld index of the edge ideals of graphs as well as an alternative proof for Fr\"oberg's theorem on classification of square-free monomial ideals generated in degree two with linear resolution. Among all, we describe the possible indices i, j for which I may have non-zero Betti numbers \beta_{i,j}.
