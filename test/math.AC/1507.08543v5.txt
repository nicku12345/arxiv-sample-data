We investigate the relationship among several numerical invariants associated to a (free) projective hypersurface V: the sequence of mixed multiplicities of its Jacobian ideal, the Hilbert polynomial of its Milnor algebra, and the sequence of exponents when V is free. As a byproduct, we obtain explicit equations for some of the homaloidal surfaces in the projective 3-dimensional space constructed by C. Ciliberto, F. Russo and A. Simis.
