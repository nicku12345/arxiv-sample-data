In this article, we study local zeta functions attached to Laurent polynomials over p-adic fields, which are non-degenerate with respect to their Newton polytopes at infinity. As an application we obtain asymptotic expansions for p-adic oscillatory integrals attached to Laurent polynomials. We show the existence of two different asymptotic expansions for p-adic oscillatory integrals, one when the absolute value of the parameter approaches infinity, the other when the absolute value of the parameter approaches zero. These two asymptotic expansions are controlled by the poles of twisted local zeta functions of Igusa type.
