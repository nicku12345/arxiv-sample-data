We study smooth complex projective polarized varieties (X,H) of dimension  n \ge 2 which admit a dominating family V of rational curves of H-degree 3, such that two general points of X may be joined by a curve parametrized by V and which do not admit a covering family of lines (i.e. rational curves of H-degree one). We prove that such manifolds are obtained from RCC manifolds of Picard number one by blow-ups along smooth centers.   If we further assume that X is a Fano manifold, we obtain a stronger result, classifying all Fano RCC manifolds of Picard number \rho_X \ge 3
