Laudal's Lemma states that if C is a curve of degree d > s^2 + 1 in \mathbb P^3 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 such that its plane section is contained in an irreducible curve of degree s, then C lies on a surface of degree s. We show that the same result does not hold in positive characteristic and we find different bounds d > f(s) which ensure that C is contained in a surface of degree s.
