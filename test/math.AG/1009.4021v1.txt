If C \subset P^3_k is an integral curve and k an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, it is known that the points of the general plane section C \cap H of C are in uniform position. From this it follows easily that the general minimal curve containing C\cap H is irreducible. If char k = p > 0, the points of C\cap H may not be in uniform position. However, we prove that the general minimal curve containing C\cap H is still irreducible.
