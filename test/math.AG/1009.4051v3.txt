Let U be a maximal unipotent subgroup of a connected semisimple group G and U' the derived group of U. If X is an affine G-variety, then the algebra of U'-invariants, k[X]^U', is finitely generated and the quotient morphism \pi: X \to X//U' is well-defined. In this article, we study properties of such quotient morphisms, e.g. the property that all the fibres of \pi are equidimensional. We also establish an analogue of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion for the null-cones with respect to U'-invariants.
