Let Q = \mathbb P^1 x \mathbb P^1 and let X\subset Q be a 0-dimensional scheme. This paper is a first step towards the characterization of Hilbert functions of 0- dimensional schemes in Q. In particular we show how, under some conditions on X, its Hilbert function changes when we add points to X lying on a (1,0) or (0, 1)-line. As a particular case we show also that if X is ACM this result holds without any additional hypothesis.
