In this note we look at the moduli space \cR_{3,2} of double covers of genus three curves, branched along 4 distinct points. This space was studied by Bardelli, Ciliberto and Verra. It admits a dominating morphism \cR_{3,2} \to {\mathcal A}_4 to Siegel space. We show that there is a birational model of \cR_{3,2} as a group quotient of a product of two Grassmannian varieties. This gives a proof of the unirationality of \cR_{3,2} and hence a new proof for the unirationality of {\mathcal A}_4.
