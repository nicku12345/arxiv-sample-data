For a projective K3 surface X we introduce the dense triangulated subcategory S^* of the bounded derived category D^b(Coh(X)) of coherent sheaves on X that is generated by spherical objects. For a K3 surface X over \bar Q it is shown that S^* admits a bounded t-structure if and only if the Bloch-Beilinson conjecture holds for X, i.e. CH^2(X)=Z.
