Building on results of Clemens and Kley, we find criteria for a continuous family of curves in a nodal K-trivial threefold Y_0 to deform to a scheme of finitely many smooth isolated curves in a general deformation Y_t of Y_0. As an application, we show the existence of smooth isolated curves of bounded genera and unbounded degrees in Calabi-Yau complete intersections threefolds.
