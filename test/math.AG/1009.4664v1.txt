We study a family of semiample divisors on the moduli space \bar{M}_{0,n} that come from the theory of conformal blocks for the Lie algebra sl_n and level 1. The divisors we study are invariant under the action of S_n on \bar{M}_{0,n}. We compute their classes and prove that they generate extremal rays in the cone of symmetric nef divisors on \bar{M}_{0,n}. In particular, these divisors define birational contractions of \bar{M}_{0,n}, which we show factor through reduction morphisms to moduli spaces of weighted pointed curves defined by Hassett.
