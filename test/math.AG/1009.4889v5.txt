We consider different notions of non-degeneracy, as introduced by Kouchnirenko (NND), Wall (INND) and Beelen-Pellikaan (WNND) for plane curve singularities \{f(x,y) = 0\} and introduce the new notion of weighted homogeneous Newton non-degeneracy (WHNND). It is known that the Milnor number \mu resp. the delta-invariant \delta can be computed by explicit formulas \mu_N resp. \delta_N from the Newton diagram of f if f is NND resp. WNND. It was however unknown whether the equalities \mu=\mu_N resp. \delta=\delta_N can be characterized by a certain non-degeneracy condition on f and, if so, by which one. We show that \mu=\mu_N resp. \delta=\delta_N is equivalent to INND resp. WHNND and give some applications and interesting examples related to the existence of "wild vanishing cycles". Although the results are new in any characteristic, the main difficulties arise in positive characteristic.
