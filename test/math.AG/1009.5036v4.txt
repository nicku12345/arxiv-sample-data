In this paper, we provide examples of Sarkisov links of type II between complex projective Fano threefolds X with \rho(X) = 1. To show examples of these links, we study smooth weak Fano threefolds with extremal rays of type E. We further assume that the pluri-anticanonical morphism contracts only a finite number of curves. We numerically classify smooth weak Fano threefolds with \rho(X) = 2 having an extremal ray of type E both before and after a flop as well as prove the existence of some of these numerical cases.
