By resolving an arbitrary perfect derived object over a Deligne-Mumford stack, we define its Euler class. We then apply it to define the Euler numbers for a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold in the 4-dimensional projective space. These numbers are conjectured to be the reduced Gromov-Witten invariants and to determine the usual Gromov-Witten numbers of the smooth quintic as speculated by J. Li and A. Zinger.
