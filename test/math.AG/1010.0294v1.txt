Smooth real cubic surfaces are birationally trivial (over \R) if and only if their real locus is connected or, equivalently, if and only if they have two skew real lines or two skew complex conjugate lines. In such a case a parametrization over the reals can be given by cubic polynomials. In this short note we provide a simple geometric method to obtain such parametrization based in an algorithm by I. Polo-Blanco and J. Top \cite{Po-Top}.
