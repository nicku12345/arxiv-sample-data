Enriques manifolds are complex spaces whose universal coverings are hyperkaehler manifolds. We introduce period domains for Enriques manifolds, establish a local Torelli theorem, and apply period maps in various situations, involving punctual Hilbert schemes, moduli spaces of stable sheaves, and Mukai flops.
