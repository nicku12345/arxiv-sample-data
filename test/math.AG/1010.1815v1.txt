Let X be any smooth simply connected projective surface. We consider some moduli space of pure sheaves of dimension one on X, i.e. \mhu with u=(0,L,\chi(u)=0) and L an effective line bundle on X, together with a series of determinant line bundles associated to r[\mo_X]-n[\mo_{pt}] in Grothendieck group of X. Let g_L denote the arithmetic genus of curves in the linear system \ls. For g_L\leq2, we give a upper bound of the dimensions of sections of these line bundles by restricting them to a generic projective line in \ls. Our result gives, together with G\"ottsche's computation, a first step of a check for the strange duality for some cases for X a rational surface.
