We study the action of the Klein simple group G consisting of 168 elements on two rational threefolds: the three-dimensional projective space and a smooth Fano threefold X of anticanonical degree 22 and index 1. We show that the Cremona group of rank three has at least three non-conjugate subgroups isomorphic to G. As a by-product, we prove that X admits a Kahler-Einstein metric, and we construct a smooth polarized K3 surface of degree 22 with an action of the group G.
