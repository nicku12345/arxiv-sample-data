Let E is be vector bundle with meromorphic connection on \proj^1/k for some field k \subset \cplx, and let \mathbf{E} be the sheaf of horizontal sections on the analytic points of X. The irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence states that there is a canonical isomorphism between the De Rham cohomology of L and the `moderate growth' cohomology of \mathbf{L}. Recent work of Beilinson, Bloch, and Esnault has shown that the determinant of this map factors into a product of local `\epsilon-factors' which closely resemble the classical \epsilon-factors of Galois representations. In this paper, we show that \epsilon-factors for rank one connections may be calculated explicitly by a Gauss sum. This formula suggests a deeper relationship between the De Rham \epsilon-factor and its Galois counterpart.
