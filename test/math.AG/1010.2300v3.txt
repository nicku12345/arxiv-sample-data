We study structures of embedded projective manifolds swept out by cubic varieties. We show if an embedded projective manifold is swept out by high-dimensional smooth cubic hypersurfaces, then it admits an extremal contraction which is a linear projective bundle or a cubic fibration. As an application, we give a characterization of smooth cubic hypersurfaces. We also classify embedded projective manifolds of dimension at most five swept out by copies of the Segre threefold P^1\timesP^2. In the course of the proof, we classify projective manifolds of dimension five swept out by planes.
