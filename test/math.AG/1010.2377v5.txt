For a smooth, irreducible projective surface S over \mathbb{C}, the number of r-nodal curves in an ample linear system |L| (where L is a line bundle on S) can be expressed using the rth Bell polynomial P_{r} in r universal functions a_{i} of (S,L), which are linear polynomials in the four Chern numbers of S and L. We use this result to establish a proof of the classical shape conjectures of Di Francesco-Itzykson and G\"ottsche governing node polynomials in the case of P^{2}. We also give a recursive procedure which provides the L^{2}-term of the polynomials a_{i}.
