Let p:F\to G be a morphism of stacks of positive \emph{virtual} relative dimension k and let \gamma\in H^k(F). We give sufficient conditions for p_*\gamma\cdot[F]^{virt} to be a multiple of [G]^{virt}. We apply this result to show an analogue of the conservation of number for virtually smooth families. We show implications to Gromov-Witten invariants and give a new proof of a theorem of Marian, Oprea and Pandharipande which compares the virtual classes of moduli spaces of stable maps and moduli spaces of stable quotients.
