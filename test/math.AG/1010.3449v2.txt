In this article, we study the possibility of producing a Calabi-Yau threefold in positive characteristic which is a counter-example to Kodaira vanishing. The only known method to construct the counter-example is so called inductive method such as the Raynaud-Mukai construction or Russel construction. We consider Mukai's method and its modification. Finally, as an application of Shepherd-Barron vanishing theorem of Fano threefolds, we compute H^1(X, H^{-1}) for any ample line bundle H on a Calabi-Yau threefold X on which Kodaira vanishing fails.
