We give a partial "quasi-stratification" of the secant varieties of the order d Veronese variety X_{m,d} of \mathbb {P}^m. It covers the set \sigma_t(X_{m,d})^{\dagger} of all points lying on the linear span of curvilinear subschemes of X_{m,d}, but two "quasi-strata" may overlap. For low border rank two different "quasi-strata" are disjoint and we compute the symmetric rank of their elements. Our tool is the Hilbert schemes of curvilinear subschemes of Veronese varieties. To get a stratification we attach to each P\in \sigma_t(X_{m,d})^{\dagger} the minimal label of a quasi-stratum containing it.
