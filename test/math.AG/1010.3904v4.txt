This is mainly a review of my results related to the title. We discuss, how many elliptic fibrations and elliptic fibrations with infinite automorphism group (or the Mordell-Weil group) an algebraic K3 surface over an algebraically closed field can have.   This was the subject of my talk at Oberwolfach Workshop "Higher dimensional elliptic fibrations" in October 2010.
