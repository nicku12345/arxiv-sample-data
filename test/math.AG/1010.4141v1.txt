We give a simplified and more algebraic proof of the finiteness of the families of Calabi-Yau n-folds with non-vanishing of Yukawa-coupling over a fixed base curve and with fixed degeneration locus. We also give a generalization of this result. Our method is variation of Hodge structure and poly-stability of Higgs bundles.
