Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0. Let F_X:X\rightarrow X be the absolute Frobenius morphism, and \E a torsion free sheaf on X. We give a upper bound of instability of truncated symmetric powers \mathrm{T}^l(\E)(0\leq l\leq\rk(\E)(p-1)) in terms of L_{\max}(\Omg^1_X), \mathrm{I}(\Omg^1_X) and \mathrm{I}(\E) (Theorem \ref{InstabTl}). As an application, We obtain a upper bound of Frobenius direct image {F_X}_*(\E) and some sufficient conditions of slope semi-stability of {F_X}_*(\E). In addition, we study the slope (semi)-stability of sheaves of locally exact (closed) forms B^i_X (Z^i_X).
