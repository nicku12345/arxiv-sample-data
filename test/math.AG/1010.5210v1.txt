Let X be a very general complete intersection in complex projective space and we denote by F_r(X) the variety of r-planes in X, for r\geq 1. We show that the Picard number of F_r(X) is 1, as soon as \dim F_r(X)\geq 2, except when X is a quadric of dimension 2r or 2r+2, or X is a complete intersection of two quadrics of dimension 2r+2. We also apply this result to determine the cohomology class of the variety of planes of a cubic fivefold contained (by the Abel-Jacobi map) in the intermediate Jacobian.
