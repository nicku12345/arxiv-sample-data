We construct, on a supersingular K3 surface with Artin invariant 1 in characteristic 2, a set of 21 disjoint smooth rational curves and another set of 21 disjoint smooth rational curves such that each curve in one set intersects exactly 5 curves from the other set with multiplicity 1 by using the structure of a generalized Kummer surface.
