We use classification of non-symplectic automorphisms of K3 surfaces to obtain a partial classification of log del Pezzo surfaces of index three. We can classify those with "Multiple Smooth Divisor Property", whose definition we will give. Our methods include the definition of right resolutions of quotient singularities of index three and some analysis of automorphism-stable elliptic fibrations on K3 surfaces. In particular we find several log del Pezzo surfaces of Picard number one with non-toric singularities of index three.
