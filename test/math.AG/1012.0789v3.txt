In this paper, we compute triangular spectrum (as defined by P. Balmer) of two classes of tensor triangulated categories which are quite common in algebraic geometry. One of them is the derived category of G-equivariant sheaves on a smooth scheme X for a finite group G which acts on X with some smoothness condition on the quotient. The other class is the derived category of split superschemes.
