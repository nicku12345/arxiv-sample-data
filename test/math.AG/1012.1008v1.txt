Let X be the germ of a smooth complex variety at a given point x\in {\mathbbb P}^N with regular osculation at order q and suppose that, for any direction v\in {\mathbbb P}T_xX, there exists a rationnal normal curve locally contained in X and passing through the point x in direction v. We show that X is necessarily a Veronese variety of order q. As a special case, we recover a classical result of Bompiani, in which it is assumed that the condition is verified by any point close to x.
