We study the relationship between positivity of line bundles restricted to complete intersection subvarieties and the vanishing of higher cohomology groups. Based on this connection we prove generalizations of the vanishing theorems of Kawamata-Viehweg and Fujita that are valid for not necessarily big line bundles.
