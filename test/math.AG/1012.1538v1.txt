A symplectic bundle over an algebraic curve has a natural invariant \sLag determined by the maximal degree of its Lagrangian subbundles. This can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Segre invariants of a vector bundle. We give a sharp upper bound on \sLag which is analogous to the Hirschowitz bound on the classical Segre invariants. Furthermore, we study the stratifications induced by \sLag on moduli spaces of symplectic bundles, and get a full picture for the case of rank four.
