We show that any of a large class of schemes receives a universal homeomorphism from a reduced scheme that in turn receives no nontrivial universal homeomorphism from any other reduced scheme. This construction serves as a categorical input for the formal inversion of universal homeomorphisms; the result is an infinity-category that embeds as a full subcategory of the h infinity-topos of Voevodsky.
