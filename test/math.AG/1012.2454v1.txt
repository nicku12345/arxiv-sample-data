The k-secant degree is studied with a combinatorial approach. A planar toric degeneration of any projective toric surface X corresponds to a regular unimodular triangulation D of the polytope defining X. If the secant ideal of the initial ideal with respect to D coincides with the initial ideal of the secant ideal, then D is said to be delightful and the k-secant degree of X can be easily computed. All delightful triangulations of toric surfaces having sectional genus g\leq1 are completely classified and, for g\geq2, a lower bound for the 2- and 3-secant degree, by means of the combinatorial geometry and the singularities of non-delightful triangulations, is established.
