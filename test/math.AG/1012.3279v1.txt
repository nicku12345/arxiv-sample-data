Let \mathcal V be a discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic with perfect residue field. Let X be a geometrically connected smooth proper curve over \mathcal V. We introduce the notion of constructible convergent \nabla-module on the analytification X_{K}^{\mathrm{an}} of the generic fibre of X. A constructible module is an \mathcal O_{X_{K}^{\mathrm{an}}}-module which is not necessarily coherent, but becomes coherent on a stratification by locally closed subsets of the special fiber X_{k} of X. The notions of connection, of (over-) convergence and of Frobenius structure carry over to this situation. We describe a specialization functor from the category of constructible convergent \nabla-modules to the category of \mathcal D^\dagger_{\hat X \mathbf Q}-modules. We show that if X is endowed with a lifting of the absolute Frobenius of X, then specialization induces an equivalence between constructible F-\nabla-modules and perverse holonomic F-\mathcal D^\dagger_{\hat X \mathbf Q}-modules.
