We look at natural foliations on the Painlev\'e VI moduli space of regular connections of rank 2 on \pp ^1 -{t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4}. These foliations are fibrations, and are interpreted in terms of the nonabelian Hodge filtration, giving a proof of the nonabelian Hodge foliation conjecture in this case. Two basic kinds of fibrations arise: from apparent singularities, and from quasiparabolic bundles. We show that these are transverse. Okamoto's additional symmetry, which may be seen as Katz's middle convolution, exchanges the quasiparabolic and apparent-singularity foliations.
