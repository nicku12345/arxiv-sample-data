Bernardi and Tirabassi show the existence of full strong exceptional collections consisting of line bundles on smooth toric Fano 3-folds under assuming Bondal's conjecture, which states that the Frobenius push-forward of the structure sheaf \mc O_X generates the derived category D^b(X) for smooth projective toric varieties X.   In this article, we show Bondal's conjecture for smooth toric Fano 3-folds and also improve their result, using birational geometry.
