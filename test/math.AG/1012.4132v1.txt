Tikhomirov (2009) proved the irreducibility of the moduli space of mathematical instantons on the projective 3-space for all odd charges. The irreducibility for charges between 1 and 5 was known before. In the present paper, the rationality of the instanton moduli spaces is proved under the assumption of the irreducibility. So, in particular, the instanton moduli spaces are rational for all odd charges and for charges 2 and 4.
