We prove new results on projective normality, normal presentation and higher syzygies for a surface of general type X embedded by adjoint line bundles L_r = K + rB, where B is a base point free, ample line bundle. Our main results determine the r for which L_r has N_p property. In corollaries, we will relate the bounds on r to the regularity of B. Examples in the last section show that several results are optimal.
