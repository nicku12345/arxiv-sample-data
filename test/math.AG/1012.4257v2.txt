Odd symplectic Grassmannians are a generalization of symplectic Grassmannians to odd-dimensional spaces. Here we compute the classical and quantum cohomology of the odd symplectic Grassmannian of lines. Although these varieties are non homogeneous, we obtain Pieri and Giambelli formulas that are very similar to the symplectic case. We notice that their quantum cohomology is semi-simple, which enables us to check Dubrovin's conjecture for this case.
