We produce for each natural number n \geq 3 two 1--parameter families of Riemann surfaces admitting automorphism groups with two cyclic subgroups H_{1} and H_{2} of orden 2^{n}, that are conjugate in the group of orientation--preserving homeomorphism of the corresponding Riemann surfaces, but not conjugate in the group of conformal automorphisms.   This property implies that the subvariety \mathcal{M}_{g}(H_{1}) of the moduli space \mathcal{M}_{g} consisting of the points representing the Riemann surfaces of genus g admitting a group of automorphisms topologically conjugate to H_{1}  (equivalently to H_{2}) is not a normal subvariety.
