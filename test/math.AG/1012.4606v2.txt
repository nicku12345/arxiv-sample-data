We obtain analogues of classical results on automorphism groups of holomorphic fiber bundles, in the setting of group schemes. Also, we establish a lifting property of the connected automorphism group, for torsors under abelian varieties. These results will be applied to the study of homogeneous bundles over abelian varieties.
