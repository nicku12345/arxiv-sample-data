We prove that the Chow quotient parametrizing configurations of n points in \mathbb{P}^d which generically lie on a rational normal curve is isomorphic to \overline{M}_{0,n}, generalizing the well-known d = 1 result of Kapranov. In particular, \overline{M}_{0,n} admits birational morphisms to all the corresponding geometric invariant theory (GIT) quotients. For symmetric linearizations the polarization on each GIT quotient pulls back to a divisor that spans the same extremal ray in the symmetric nef cone of \overline{M}_{0,n} as a conformal blocks line bundle. A symmetry in conformal blocks implies a duality of point-configurations that comes from Gale duality and generalizes a result of Goppa in algebraic coding theory. In a suitable sense, \overline{M}_{0,2m} is fixed pointwise by the Gale transform when d=m-1 so stable curves correspond to self-associated configurations.
