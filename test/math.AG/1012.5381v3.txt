v2: A few typos corrected, a few formulations improved.   On X projective smooth over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, we show that irreducible stratified bundles have rank 1 if and only if the commutator [\pi_1^{{\rm \acute{e}t}}, \pi_1^{{\rm \acute{e}t}}] of the \'etale fundamental group is a pro-p-group, and we show that the category of stratified bundles is semi-simple with irreducible objects of rank 1 if and only if  \pi_1^{{\rm \acute{e}t}} is abelian without p-power quotient. This answers positively a conjecture by Gieseker.
