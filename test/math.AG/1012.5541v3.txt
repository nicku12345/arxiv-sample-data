Given any line bundle L of positive degree, on a compact Riemann surface, let M_L^\Lambda be the moduli space of L-twisted Higgs pairs of rank 2 with fixed determinant isomorphic to \Lambda and traceless Higgs field. We give a description of the singular fibre of the Hitchin map H:M^L_\Lambda\to H^0(L^2), when the corresponding spectral curve has any singularity of type A_{m-1}. In particular, we prove directly that this fibre is connected.
