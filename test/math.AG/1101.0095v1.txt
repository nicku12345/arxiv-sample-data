For a real smooth algebraic curve A \subset (\mathhbb{C}^*)^2, the amoeba \mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 is the image of A under the map Log : (x,y) \mapsto (\log |x|, \log | y |). We describe an universal bound for the total curvature of the real amoeba \mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{R} A} and we prove that this bound is reached if and only if the curve A is a simple Harnack curve in the sense of Mikhalkin.
