For a toric variety X_P determined by a rational polyhedral fan P in a lattice N, Payne shows that the equivariant Chow cohomology of X_P is the Sym(N)--algebra C^0(P) of integral piecewise polynomial functions on P. We use the Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence to analyze the associated reflexive sheaf on Proj(N), showing that the Chern classes depend on subtle geometry of P and giving criteria for the splitting of the sheaf as a sum of line bundles. For certain fans associated to the reflection arrangement A_n, we describe a connection between C^0(P) and logarithmic vector fields tangent to A_n.
