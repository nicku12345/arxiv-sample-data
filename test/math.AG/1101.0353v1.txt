We combine work of Cox on the total coordinate ring of a toric variety and results of Eisenbud-Mustata-Stillman and Mustata on cohomology of toric and monomial ideals to obtain a formula for computing the Euler characteristic of a Weil divisor D on a complete simplicial toric variety in terms of graded pieces of the Cox ring and Stanley-Reisner ring. The main point is to use Alexander duality to pass from the toric irrelevant ideal, which appears in the computation of the Euler characteristic of D, to the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the fan, which is used in defining the Chow ring. The formula also follows from work of Maclagan-Smith.
