A Brauer pair is a pair (X, {\alpha}) where X is a quasi-projective variety over an algebraically closed field and {\alpha} is an element in the 2-torsion part of the Brauer group of the function field of X. A Brauer pair (Y, {\alpha}) is a terminal pair if the Brauer discrepancy of (Y, {\alpha}) is positive. We show that given a Brauer pair (X, {\alpha}), there is a terminal pair (Y, {\alpha}) with a birational morphism Y -> X. In short, any Brauer pair admits a terminal resolution.
