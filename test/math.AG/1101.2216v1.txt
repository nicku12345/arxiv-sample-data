We show that any complex manifold that has a divisor whose normalization has non-zero first Betti number either has a non-trivial holomorphic gerbe which does not trivialize meromorphicly or a meromorphic line bundle not equivalent to any holomorphic line bundle. Similarly, higher Betti numbers of divisors correspond to higher gerbes or meromorphic gerbes. We give several new examples.
