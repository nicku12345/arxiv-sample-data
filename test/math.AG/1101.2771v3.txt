We obtain characterizations and structure results for homogeneous principal bundles over abelian varieties, that generalize work of Miyanishi and Mukai on homogeneous vector bundles. For this, we rely on notions and methods of algebraic transformation groups, especially observable subgroups and anti-affine groups.
