We prove that the space of smooth rational curves of degree e in a general complete intersection of multidegree (d_1, ..., d_m) in \PP^n is irreducible of the expected dimension if \sum_{i=1}^m d_i <\frac{2n}{3} and n is large enough. This generalizes the results of Harris, Roth and Starr \cite{hrs}, and is achieved by proving that the space of conics passing through any point of a general complete intersection has constant dimension if \sum_{i=1}^m d_i is small compared to n.
