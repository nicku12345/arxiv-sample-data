We survey recent results about the Torelli question for holomorphic-symplectic varieties. Following are the main topics. A Hodge theoretic Torelli theorem. A study of the subgroup W, of the isometry group of the weight 2 Hodge structure, generated by reflection with respect to exceptional divisors. A description of the birational Kahler cone as a fundamental domain for the W-action on the positive cone. A proof of a weak version of Morrison's movable cone conjecture. A description of the moduli spaces of polarized holomorphic symplectic varieties as monodromy quotients of period domains of type IV.
