For any reduced curve C\subset \mathbb P^2, we define the notions of the number of its virtual cusps c_v and the number of its virtual nodes n_v which are non-negative, coincide respectively with the numbers of ordinary cusps and nodes in the case of cuspidal curves, and if \hat C is the dual curve of an irreducible curve C and \hat n_v and \hat c_v are the numbers of its virtual nodes and virtual cusps, then the integers c_v, n_v, \hat c_v, \hat n_v satisfy Classical Pl\"{u}cker's formulae.
