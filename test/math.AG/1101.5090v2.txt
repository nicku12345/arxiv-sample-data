Let X_{m,d}\subset \mathbb {P}^N, N:= \binom{m+d}{m}-1, be the order d Veronese embedding of \mathbb {P}^m. Let \tau (X_{m,d})\subset \mathbb {P}^N, be the tangent developable of X_{m,d}. For each integer t \ge 2 let \tau (X_{m,d},t)\subseteq \mathbb {P}^N, be the joint of \tau (X_{m,d}) and t-2 copies of X_{m,d}. Here we prove that if m\ge 2, d\ge 7 and t \le 1 + \lfloor \binom{m+d-2}{m}/(m+1)\rfloor, then for a general P\in \tau (X_{m,d},t) there are uniquely determined P_1,...,P_{t-2}\in X_{m,d} and a unique tangent vector \nu of X_{m,d} such that P is in the linear span of \nu \cup \{P_1,...,P_{t-2}\}, i.e. a degree d linear form f associated to P may be written as f = L_{t-1}^{d-1}L_t + \sum_{i=1}^{t-2} L_i^d with L_i, 1 \le i \le t, uniquely determined (up to a constant) linear forms on \mathbb {P}^m.
