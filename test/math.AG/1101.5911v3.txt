In this article we obtain many results on the multiplicative structure constants of T-equivariant Grothendieck ring of the flag variety G/B. We do this by lifting the classes of the structure sheaves of Schubert varieties in K_{T}(G/B) to R(T)\otimes R(T), where R(T) denotes the representation ring of the torus T. We further apply our results to describe the multiplicative structure constants of K(X)_{\mathbb Q} where X is the wonderful compactification of the adjoint group of G, in terms of the structure constants of Schubert varieties in the Grothendieck ring of G/B.
