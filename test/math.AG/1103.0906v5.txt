We investigate differential systems occurring in the study of particular non-isolated singularities, the so-called linear free divisors. We obtain a duality theorem for these D-modules taking into account filtrations, and deduce degeneration properties of certain Frobenius manifolds associated to linear sections of the Milnor fibres of the divisor.
