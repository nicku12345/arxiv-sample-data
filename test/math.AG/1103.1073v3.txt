Suppose that X is a complex projective variety and L is a pseudo-effective divisor. A numerical reduction map is a quotient of X by all subvarieties along which L is numerically trivial. We construct two variants: the L-trivial reduction map and the pseudo-effective reduction map of [Eckl05]. We show that these maps capture interesting geometric properties of L and use them to analyze abundant divisors.
