We construct projectivization of a parabolic vector bundle and a tautological line bundle over it. It is shown that a parabolic vector bundle is ample if and only if the tautological line bundle is ample. This allows us to generalize the notion of a k-ample bundle, introduced by Sommese, to the context of parabolic bundles. A parabolic vector bundle E_* is defined to be k-ample if the tautological line bundle {\mathcal O}_{{\mathbb P}(E_*)}(1) is k--ample. We establish some properties of parabolic k-ample bundles.
