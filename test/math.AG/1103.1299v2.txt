We give a cohomological criterion for a parabolic vector bundle on a curve to be semistable. It says that a parabolic vector bundle E with rational parabolic weights is semistable if and only if there is another parabolic vector bundle F with rational parabolic weights such that the cohomologies of the vector bundle underlying the para- bolic tensor product E \otimes F vanish. This criterion generalizes the known semistability criterion of Faltings for vector bundles on curves and significantly improves the result in [Bis07].
