We show that the universal plane curve M of fixed degree d > 2 can be seen as a closed subvariety in a certain Simpson moduli space of 1-dimensional sheaves on a projective plane contained in the stable locus. The universal singular locus coincides with the subvariety of M consisting of sheaves that are not locally free on their support. It turns out that the blow up of M along M' may be naturally seen as a compactification of M_B = M\M' by vector bundles (on support).
