Two quasi-projective varieties are called piecewise isomorphic if they can be stratified into pairwise isomorphic strata. We show that the m-th symmetric power S^m(C^n) of the complex affine space C^n is piecewise isomorphic to C^{mn} and the m-th symmetric power S^m(CP^\infty) of the infinite dimensional complex projective space is piecewise isomorphic to the infinite dimensional Grassmannian Gr(m,\infty).
