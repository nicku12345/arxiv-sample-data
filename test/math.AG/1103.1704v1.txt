Based on work of R. Lazarsfeld and M. Popa, we use the derivative complex associated to the bundle of the holomorphic p-forms to provide inequalities for all the Hodge numbers of a special class of irregular compact Kaehler manifolds. For 3-folds and 4-folds we give an asymptotic bound for all the Hodge numbers in terms of the irregularity. As a byproduct, via the BGG correspondence, we also bound the regularity of the exterior cohomology modules of bundles of holomorphic p-forms.
