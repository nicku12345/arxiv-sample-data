In this paper, we introduce the category of blueprints, which is a category of algebraic objects that include both commutative (semi)rings and commutative monoids. This generalization allows a simultaneous treatment of ideals resp.\ congruences for rings and monoids and leads to a common scheme theory. In particular, it bridges the gap between usual schemes and \mathbb{F}_1-schemes (after Kato, Deitmar and Connes-Consani). Beside this unification, the category of blueprints contains new interesting objects as "improved" cyclotomic field extensions \mathbb{F}_{1^n} of \mathbb{F}_1 and "archimedean valuation rings". It also yields a notion of semiring schemes.   This first paper lays the foundation for subsequent projects, which are devoted to the following problems: Tits' idea of Chevalley groups over \mathbb{F}_1, congruence schemes, sheaf cohomology, K-theory and a unified view on analytic geometry over \mathbb{F}_1, adic spaces (after Huber), analytic spaces (after Berkovich) and tropical geometry.
