We give lower bounds on the number of effective divisors of degree \leq g-1 with respect to the number of places of certain degrees of an algebraic function field of genus g defined over a finite field. We deduce lower bounds and asymptotics for the class number, depending mainly on the number of places of a certain degree. We give examples of towers of algebraic function fields having a large class number.
