Applying tropical geometry a framework for mirror symmetry, including a mirror construction for Calabi-Yau varieties, was proposed by the author. We discuss the conceptual foundations of this construction based on a natural mirror map identifying deformations and divisors. We show how the construction specializes to that by Batyrev for hypersurfaces and its generalization by Batyrev and Borisov to complete intersections. Based on an explicit example we comment on the implementation in the Macaulay2 package SRdeformations.
