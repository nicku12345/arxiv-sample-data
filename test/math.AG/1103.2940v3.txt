We give a list of possibilities for surfaces of general type with p_g=0 having an involution i such that the bicanonical map of S is not composed with i and S/i is not rational. Some examples with K^2=4,...,7 are constructed as double coverings of an Enriques surface. These surfaces have a description as bidouble coverings of the plane.
