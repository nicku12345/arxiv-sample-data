We prove that every map-germ {f \bar g}: (\C^n,\0) {\to}(\C,0) with an isolated critical value at 0 has the Thom a_{f \bar g}-property. This extends Hironaka's theorem for holomorphic mappings to the case of map-germs f \bar g and it implies that every such map-germ has a Milnor-L\^e fibration defined on a Milnor tube. One thus has a locally trivial fibration \phi: \mathbb S_\e \setminus K \to \mathbb S^1 for every sufficiently small sphere around \0, where K is the link of f \bar g and in a neighbourhood of K the projection map \phi is given by f \bar g / | f \bar g|.
