Let G2 be the exceptional Lie group of automorphisms of the complex Cayley algebra and C be a smooth, connected, projective curve of genus at least 2. Using the map obtained from extension of structure groups, we prove explicit links between the space of generalized G2-theta functions over C and spaces of generalized theta functions associated to the classical Lie groups SL_2 and SL_3.
