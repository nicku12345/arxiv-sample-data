We show that some Gieseker stable sheaves on a projective K3 surface X are stable with respect to a stability condition of Bridgeland on the derived category of X if the stability condition is in explicit subsets of the space of stability conditions depending on the sheaves. Furthermore we shall give two applications of the result. As a part of these applications, we show that the fine moduli space of Gieseker stable torsion free sheaves on a K3 surface with Picard number one is the moduli space of \mu-stable locally free sheaves if the rank of the sheaves is not a square number.
