In this paper we complete the determination of the index of factoriality of moduli spaces of semistable sheaves on an abelian or projective K3 surface S. If v=2w is a Mukai vector, w is primitive, w^{2}=2 and H is a generic polarization, let M_{v}(S,H) be the moduli space of H-semistable sheaves on S with Mukai vector v. First, we describe in terms of v the pure weight-two Hodge structure and the Beauville form on the second integral cohomology of the symplectic resolutions of M_{v}(S,H) (when S is K3) and of the fiber K_{v}(S,H) of the Albanese map of M_{v}(S,H) (when S is abelian). Then, if S is K3 we show that M_{v}(S,H) is either locally factorial or 2-factorial, and we give an example of both cases. If S is abelian, we show that M_{v}(S,H) and K_{v}(S,H) are 2-factorial.
