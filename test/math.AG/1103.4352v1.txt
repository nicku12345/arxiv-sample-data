For the derived category of bounded complexes of sheaves on a smooth projective surface, Bridgeland and Arcara-Bertram constructed Bridgeland stability conditions (Z_m, \mathcal P_m) parametrized by m \in (0, +\infty). In this paper, we show that the set of mini-walls in (0, +\infty) of a fixed numerical type is locally finite. In addition, we strengthen a result of Bayer by proving that the moduli of polynomial Bridgeland semistable objects of a fixed numerical type coincides with the moduli of (Z_m, \mathcal P_m)-semistable objects whenever m is larger than a universal constant depending only on the numerical type. We further identify the moduli of polynomial Bridgeland semistable objects with the Gieseker/Simpson moduli spaces and the Uhlenbeck compactification spaces.
