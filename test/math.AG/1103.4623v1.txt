We introduce a variety \hat{G}_2 parameterizing isotropic five-spaces of a general degenerate four-form in a seven dimensional vector space. It is in a natural way a degeneration of the variety G_2, the adjoint variety of the simple Lie group \mathbb{G}_2. It occurs that it is also the image of \mathbb{P}^5 by a system of quadrics containing a twisted cubic. Degenerations of this twisted cubic to three lines give rise to degenerations of G_2 which are toric Gorenstein Fano fivefolds. We use these two degenerations to construct geometric transitions between Calabi--Yau threefolds. We prove moreover that every polarized K3 surface of Picard number 2, genus 10, and admitting a g^1_5 appears as linear sections of the variety \hat{G}_2.
