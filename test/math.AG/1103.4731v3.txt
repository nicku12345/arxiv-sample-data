When a reductive group G acts linearly on a complex projective scheme X there is a stratification of X into G-invariant locally closed subschemes, with an open stratum X^{ss} formed by the semistable points in the sense of Mumford's geometric invariant theory which has a categorical quotient X^{ss} \to X//G. In this article we describe a method for constructing quotients of the unstable strata. As an application, we construct moduli spaces of sheaves of fixed Harder-Narasimhan type with some extra data (an 'n-rigidification') on a projective base.
