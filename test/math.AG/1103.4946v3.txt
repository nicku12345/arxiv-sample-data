We give explicit computational algorithms to construct minimal degree (always \le 4) ramified covers of \Prj^1 for algebraic curves of genus 5 and 6. This completes the work of Schicho and Sevilla (who dealt with the g \le 4 case) on constructing radical parametrisations of arbitrary genus g curves. Zariski showed that this is impossible for the general curve of genus \ge 7. We also construct minimal degree birational plane models and show how the existence of degree 6 plane models for genus 6 curves is related to the gonality and geometric type of a certain auxiliary surface.
