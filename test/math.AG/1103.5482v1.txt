We consider the general problem of deforming a surjective map of modules f : E \to F over a coproduct sheaf of rings B=B_1 \otimes_A B_2 when the domain module E = B_1 \otimes_A E_2 is obtained via extension of scalars from a B_2-module E_2. Assuming B_1 is flat over A, we show that the Atiyah class morphism F \to \LL_{B/B_2} \otimes^{\bL} F[1] in the derived category D(B) factors naturally through (the shift of) a morphism \beta : \Ker f \to \LL_{B/B_2} \otimes^{\bL} F. We describe the obstruction to lifting f over a (square zero) extension B_1' \to B_1 in terms of \beta and the class of the extension. As an application, we use the reduced Atiyah class to construct a perfect obstruction theory on the Quot scheme of a vector bundle on a smooth curve (and more generally).
