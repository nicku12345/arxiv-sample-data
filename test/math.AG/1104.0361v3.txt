We prove the finiteness of log pluricanonical representations for projective log canonical pairs with semi-ample log canonical divisor. As a corollary, we obtain that the log canonical divisor of a projective semi log canonical pair is semi-ample if and only if so is the log canonical divisor of its normalization. We also treat many other applications.
