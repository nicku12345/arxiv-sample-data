Let X be a normal affine algebraic variety with regular action of a torus \TT and T\subset\TT be a subtorus. We prove that each root of X with respect to T can be obtained by restriction of some root of X with respect to \TT. This allows to get an elementary proof of the description of roots of the affine Cremona group. Several results on restriction of roots in the case of subtorus action on an affine toric variety are obtained.
