We consider those projective bundles (or Brauer-Severi varieties) over an abelian variety that are homogeneous, i.e., invariant under translation. We describe the structure of these bundles in terms of projective representations of commutative algebraic groups; the irreducible bundles correspond to Heisenberg groups and their standard representations. Our results extend those of Mukai on semi-homogeneous vector bundles, and yield a geometric view of the Brauer group of abelian varieties.
