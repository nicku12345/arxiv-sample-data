We obtain an explicit presentation of the equivariant cobordism ring of a complete flag variety. An immediate corollary is a Borel presentation of the ordinary cobordism ring. Another application is an equivariant Schubert calculus in cobordism. We also describe the rational cobordism rings of wonderful symmetric varieties of minimal rank.
