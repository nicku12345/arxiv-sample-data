We study Glois embeddings of K3 surfaces in the case where the Galois groups are abelian. We show several properties of K3 surfaces concerning the Galois embeddings. In particular, if the Galois group G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to Z/4Z, Z/6Z or Z/2Z\oplusZ/2Z\oplusZ/2Z and S is a smooth complete intersection of hypersurfaces. Further, we state the detailed structure of such surfaces.
