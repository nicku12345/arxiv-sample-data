We show that the vector of period ratios of a cubic surface is rational over Q(\omega), where \omega = \exp(2\pi i/3) if and only if the associate abelian variety is isogeneous to a product of Fermat elliptic curves. We also show how to construct cubic surfaces from a suitable totally real quintic number field K_0. The ring of rational endomorphisms of the associated abelian variety is K = K_0(\omega).
