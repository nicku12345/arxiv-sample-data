We compute the center of the ring of PD differential operators on a smooth variety over \bZ/p^n\bZ confirming a conjecture of Kaledin. More generally, given an associative algebra A_0 over \bF_p and its flat deformation A_n over \bZ/p^{n+1}\bZ we prove that under a certain non-degeneracy condition the center of A_n is isomorphic to the ring of length n+1 Witt vectors over the center of A_0.
