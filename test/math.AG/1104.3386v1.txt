We consider two mixed curve C,C'\subset {\Bbb C}^2 which are defined by mixed functions of two variables \bf z=(z_1,z_2). We have shown in \cite{MC}, that they have canonical orientations.   If C and C' are smooth and intersect transversely at P, the intersection number I_{top}(C,C';P) is topologically defined. We will generalize this definition to the case when the intersection is not necessarily transversal or either C or C' may be singular at P using the defining mixed polynomials.
