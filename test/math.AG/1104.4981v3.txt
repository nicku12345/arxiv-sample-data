Let (X/Z,B+A) be a \Q-factorial dlt pair where B,A\ge 0 are \Q-divisors and K_X+B+A\sim_\Q 0/Z. We prove that any LMMP/Z on K_X+B with scaling of an ample/Z divisor terminates with a good log minimal model or a Mori fibre space. We show that a more general statement follows from the ACC for lc thresholds. An immediate corollary of these results is that log flips exist for log canonical pairs.
