Let \sigma_1 and \sigma_2 be commuting involutions of a semisimple algebraic group G. This yields a Z_2\times Z_2-grading of \g=\Lie(G), \g=\bigoplus_{i,j=0,1}\g_{ij}, and we study invariant-theoretic aspects of this decomposition. Let \g<\sigma_1> be the Z_2-contraction of \g determined by \sigma_1. Then both \sigma_2 and \sigma_3:=\sigma_1\sigma_2 remain involutions of the non-reductive Lie algebra \g<\sigma_1>. The isotropy representations related to (\g<\sigma_1>, \sigma_2) and (\g<\sigma_1>, \sigma_3) are degenerations of the isotropy representations related to (\g, {\sigma_2}) and (\g, {\sigma_3}), respectively. We show that these degenerated isotropy representations retain many good properties. For instance, they always have a generic stabiliser and their algebras of invariants are often polynomial. We also develop some theory on Cartan subspaces for various Z_2-gradings associated with the Z_2\times Z_2-grading of \g.
