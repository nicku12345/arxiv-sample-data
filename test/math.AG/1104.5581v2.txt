Let G be a reductive group and X be a Luna stratum on the quotient space V//G of a rational G-module V. We consider torsors over X with both non-commutative and commutative structure groups. It allows us to compute the divisor class group and the Cox ring of a Luna stratum under mild assumptions. This techniques gives a simple cause why many Luna strata are singular along their boundary.
