We investigate the moduli spaces of one- and two-dimensional sheaves on projective K3 and abelian surfaces that are semistable with respect to a nongeneral ample divisor with regard to the symplectic resolvability. We can exclude the existence of new examples of projective irreducible symplectic manifolds lying birationally over components of the moduli spaces of one-dimensional semistable sheaves on K3 surfaces, and over components of many of the moduli spaces of two-dimensional sheaves on K3 surfaces, in particular, of those for rank two sheaves.
