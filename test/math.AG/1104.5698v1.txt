We give an explicit solution of the ADHM recursion formula conjectured by Chuang, Diaconescu, and Pan. This solution is closely related to the formula for the Hodge polynomials of Higgs moduli spaces conjectured by Hausel and Rodriguez-Villegas. We solve also the twisted motivic ADHM recursion formula. As a byproduct we obtain a conjectural formula for the motives of twisted Higgs moduli spaces, which generalizes the conjecture of Hausel and Rodriguez-Villegas.
