We study the moduli space of Gieseker semi-stable sheaves on the complex projective plane supported on sextic curves and having Euler characteristic one. We determine locally free resolutions of length one for all such sheaves. We decompose the moduli space into strata which occur naturally as quotients modulo actions of certain algebraic groups. In some cases we give concrete geometric descriptions of the strata.
