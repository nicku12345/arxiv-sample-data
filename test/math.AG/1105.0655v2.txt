We study cyclic covering morphisms from \bar{M}_{0,n} to moduli spaces of unpointed stable curves of positive genus or compactified moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian varieties. Our main application is a construction of new semipositive vector bundles and nef divisors on \bar{M}_{0,n}, with a view toward the F-conjecture. In particular, we construct new extremal rays of the symmetric nef cone of \bar{M}_{0,n}. We also find an alternate description of all sl level 1 conformal blocks divisors on \bar{M}_{0,n}.
