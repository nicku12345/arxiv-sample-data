Let X be the variety obtained by the Weil transfer with respect to a quadratic separable field extension of a generalized Severi-Brauer variety. We study (and, in some cases, determine) the canonical dimension, incompressibility, and motivic indecomposability of X. We determine the canonical 2-dimension of X (in the general case).
