We define and study the functorial spectrum for every triangulated tensor category. A reconstruction result for topologically noetherian schemes similar to (and based on) a theorem by Balmer is proved. An alternative proof of the reconstruction theorem by Bondal-Orlov for smooth projective varieties with ample (anti-)canonical bundles is given.
