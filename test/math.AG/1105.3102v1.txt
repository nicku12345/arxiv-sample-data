Determining the number of singular fibers in a family of varieties over a curve is a generalization of Shafarevich's Conjecture and has implications for the types of subvarieties that can appear in the corresponding moduli stack. We consider families of log canonically polarized varieties over \P^1, i.e. families g:(Y,D)\to \P^1 where D is an effective snc divisor and the sheaf \omega_{Y/\P^1}(D) is g-ample. After first defining what it means for fibers of such a family to be singular, we show that with the addition of certain mild hypotheses (the fibers have finite automorphism group, \sO_Y(D) is semi-ample, and the components of D must avoid the singular locus of the fibers and intersect the fibers transversely), such a family must either be isotrivial or contain at least 3 singular fibers.
