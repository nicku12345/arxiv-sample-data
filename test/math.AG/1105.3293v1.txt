The paper is a second step in the study of \overline{M}_{0,n} started in arXiv:1006.0987 [math.AG]. We study fiber type morphisms of this moduli space via Kapranov's beautiful description. Our final goal is to understand if any dominant morphism f: \overline{M}_{0,n} \to X with positive dimensional fibers factors through forgetful morphisms. We prove that this is true if either n \leq 7 or \rm {dim} X \leq 2 or the rational map induced on P^{n-3} has linear general fibers. Along the way we give examples of forgetful morphisms whose fibers are connected curves of arbitrarily high positive genus, for n>>0.
