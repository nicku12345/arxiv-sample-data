We study smooth complex projective varieties X of maximal Albanese dimension and of general type satisfying with vanishing holomorphic Euler characteristic. We prove that the Albanese variety of X has at least three simple factors. Examples were constructed by Ein and Lazarsfeld, and we prove that in dimension 3, these examples are (up to abelian \'etale covers) the only ones. By results of Ueno, another source of examples is provided by varieties X of maximal Albanese dimension and of general type with p_g(X)=1. Examples were constructed by Chen and Hacon, and again, we prove that in dimension 3, these examples are (up to abelian \'etale covers) the only ones. We also formulate a conjecture on the general structure of these varieties in all dimensions.
