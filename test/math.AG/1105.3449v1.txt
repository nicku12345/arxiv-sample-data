A recent paper of Totaro develops a theory of q-ample bundles in characteristic 0. Specifically, a line bundle L on X is q-ample if for every coherent sheaf \mathcal{F} on X, there exists an integer m_0 such that m\geq m_0 implies H^i(X,\mathcal{F}\otimes \mathcal{O}(mL))=0 for i>q. We show that a line bundle L on a complex projective scheme X is q-ample if and only if the restriction of L to its augmented base locus is q-ample. In particular, when X is a variety and L is big but fails to be q-ample, then there exists a codimension 1 subscheme D of X such that the restriction of L to D is not q-ample.
