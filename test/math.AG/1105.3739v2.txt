We show that every automorphism of the group \mathcal{G}_n:= \textrm{Aut}(\mathbb{A}^n) of polynomial automorphisms of complex affine n-space \mathbb{A}^n=\mathbb{C}^n is inner up to field automorphisms when restricted to the subgroup T \mathcal{G}_n of tame automorphisms. This generalizes a result of \textsc{Julie Deserti} who proved this in dimension n=2 where all automorphisms are tame: T \mathcal{G}_2 = \mathcal{G}_2.
