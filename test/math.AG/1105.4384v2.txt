It was conjectured in \cite{Namikawa_ExtendedTorelli} that the Torelli map M_g\to A_g associating to a curve its jacobian extends to a regular map from the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable curves \bar{M}_g to the (normalization of the) Igusa blowup \bar{A}_g^{\rm cent}. A counterexample in genus g=9 was found in \cite{AlexeevBrunyate}.   Here, we prove that the extended map is regular for all g\le8, thus completely solving the problem in every genus.
