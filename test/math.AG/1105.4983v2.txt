We classify minimal surfaces S of general type with p_g=q=2 and K_S^2=6 whose Albanese map is a generically finite double cover. We show that the corresponding moduli space is the disjoint union of three generically smooth, irreducible components \mathcal{M}_{Ia}, \mathcal{M}_{Ib}, \mathcal{M}_{II} of dimension 4, 4, 3, respectively. The general surface S contains a smooth elliptic curve Z such that Z^2=-2, which is contracted by the Albanese map and which is preserved by any first-order deformation.
