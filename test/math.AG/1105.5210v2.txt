Let k be a perfect field of characteristic p, let f_i:X_i\to\mathbb A_k^1 (i=1,2) be two k-morphism of finite type, and let f:X_1\times_k X_2\to \mathbb A_k^1 be the morphism defined by f(z_1,z_2)=f_1(z_1)+f_2(z_2). For each i\in\{1,2\}, let x_i be a k-rational point in the fiber f_i^{-1}(0) such that f_i is smooth on X_i-\{x_i\}. Using the \ell-adic Fourier transformation and the stationary phase principle of Laumon, we prove that the vanishing cycle of f at x=(x_1,x_2) is the convolution product of the vanishing cycles of f_i at x_i (i=1,2).
