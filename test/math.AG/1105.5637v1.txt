Let \clX a projective stack over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0. Let \clE be a generating sheaf over \clX and \clO_X(1) a polarization of its coarse moduli space X. We define a notion of pair which is the datum of a non vanishing morphism \Gamma\otimes\clE\to \clF where \Gamma is a finite dimensional k vector space and \clF is a coherent sheaf over \clX. We construct the stack and the moduli space of semistable pairs. The notion of semistability depends on a polynomial parameter and it is dictated by the GIT construction of the moduli space.
