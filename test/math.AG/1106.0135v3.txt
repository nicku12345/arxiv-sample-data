Let k be a complete, non-Archimedean field and let X be a k-analytic space ; assume that there exists a tamely ramified finite extension L/k such that X_L is isomorphic to an open polydisc over L ; we prove that X is itself isomorphic to an open polydisc over k. The proof consists in using the {\em graded} reduction (a notion which is due to Temkin) of the algebra of functions on X, together with some graded counterparts of classical commutative algebra results: Nakayama's lemma, going-up theorem, basic notions about \'etale algebras, etc.
