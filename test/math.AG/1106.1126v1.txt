We introduce the notion of an approximate jacobian Newton diagram which is the jacobian Newton diagram of the morphism (f^{(k)},f), where f is a branch and f^{(k)} is a characteristic approximate root of f. We prove that the set of all approximate jacobian Newton diagrams is a complete topological invariant. This generalizes theorems of Merle and Ephraim about the decomposition of the polar curve of a branch.
