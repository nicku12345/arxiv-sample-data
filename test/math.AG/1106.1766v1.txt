Let X be a compact Riemann surface. A quadratic pair on X consists of a holomorphic vector bundle with a quadratic form which takes values in fixed line bundle. We show that the moduli spaces of quadratic pairs of rank 2 are connected under some constraints on their topological invariants. As an application of our results we determine the connected components of the \mathrm{SO}_0(2,3)-character variety of X.
