Let \M_g be the course moduli space of complex projective nonsingular curves of genus g. We prove that when the Brill-Noether number \rho(g,1,n) is non-negative the Petri locus P^1_{g,n}\subset \M_g has a divisorial component whose closure has a non-empty intersection with \Delta_0. In order to prove the result we show that the scheme G^1_n(\Gamma) that parametrizes degree n pencils on a curve \Gamma is isomorphic to a component of the Hilbert scheme parametrizing certain curves on the symmetric square \Gamma_2 of \Gamma and we study the properties of such a family of curves.
