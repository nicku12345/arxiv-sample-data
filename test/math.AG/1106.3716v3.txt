We characterise smooth curves in P^3 whose blow-up produces a threefold with anticanonical divisor big and nef. These are curves C of degree d and genus g lying on a smooth quartic, such that (i) 4d-30 \le g\le 14 or (g,d) = (19,12), (ii) there is no 5-secant line, 9-secant conic, nor 13-secant twisted cubic to C. This generalises the classical similar situation for the blow-up of points in P^2.   We describe then Sarkisov links constructed from these blow-ups, and are able to prove the existence of Sarkisov links which were previously only known as numerical possibilities.
