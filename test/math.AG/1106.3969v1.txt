In his book SGA2, A. Grothendieck proved Lefschetz theorems, in particular for the Picard group. To some extent he was able to deal with vector bundles instead of line bundles. Here we use his methods in order to study vector bundles on quasi-projective varieties instead of projective ones (as Grothendieck did). In particular we look at the case of complex algebraic varieties where we can compare with the complex analytic category. Finally we study vector bundles with a connection where stronger results can be achieved.
