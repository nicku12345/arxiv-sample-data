The cotangent bundle of a non-uniruled projective manifold is generically nef, due to a theorem of Miyaoka. We show that the cotangent bundle is actually generically ample, if the manifold is of general type and study in detail the case of intermediate Kodaira dimension. Moreover, manifolds with generically nef and ample tangent bundles are investigated as well as connections to classical theorems on vector fields on projective manifolds.
