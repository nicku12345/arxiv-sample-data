We give a canonical synthetic construction of the mirror family to a pair (Y,D) of a smooth projective surface with an anti-canonical cycle of rational curves, as the spectrum of an explicit algebra defined in terms of counts of rational curves on Y meeting D in a single point. In the case D is contractible, the family gives a smoothing of the dual cusp, and thus a proof of Looijenga's 1981 cusp conjecture.
