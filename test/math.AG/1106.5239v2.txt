We define and study preorderings and orderings on rings of the form M_n(R) where R is a commutative unital ring. We extend the Artin-Lang theorem and Krivine-Stengle Stellens\"atze (both abstract and geometric) from R to M_n(R). While the orderings of M_n(R) are in one-to-one correspondence with the orderings of R, this is not true for preorderings. Therefore, our theory is not Morita equivalent to the classical real algebraic geometry.
