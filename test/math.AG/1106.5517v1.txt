This paper began as an investigation of the question of whether D_1 \otimes_F D_2 is a domain where the D_i are division algebras and F is an algebraically closed field contained in their centers. We present an example where the answer is "no", and also study the Picard group and Brauer group properties of F_1 \otimes_F F_2 where the F_i are fields. Finally, as part of our example, we have results about division algebras and Brauer groups over curves. Specifically, we give a splitting criterion for certain Brauer group elements on the product of two curves over F.
