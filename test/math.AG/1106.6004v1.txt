Let \Pi be the \'etale fundamental group of a smooth affine curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0. We establish a criterion for profinite freeness of closed subgroups of \Pi. Roughly speaking, if a closed subgroup of \Pi is "captured" between two normal subgroups, then it is free, provided it contains most of the open subgroups of index p. In the proof we establish a strong version of "almost \omega-freeness" of \Pi and then apply the Haran-Shapiro induction.
