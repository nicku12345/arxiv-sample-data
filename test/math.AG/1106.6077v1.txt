Let O be a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring having a finite field as a coefficient field. The aim of this work is to extend the explicit computations of the St\"ohr Zeta Function of O for one and two branches to an arbitrary number of them, obtaining in this general case an upper bound for the coefficients of the zeta function, instead of an equality. The calculations are based on the use of the value semigroup of a curve singularity and a suitable classification of the maximal points of the semigroup.
