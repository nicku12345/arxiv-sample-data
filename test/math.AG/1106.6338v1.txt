We study plane curves of type p,q having only nodes as singularities. Every Weierstra\ss semigroup is the Weierstra\ss semigroup of such a curve at its place at infinity for properly chosen p,q. We construct plane curves of type p,q with explicitly given nodes and determine their Weierstra\ss semigroups. Many such semigroups are found.
