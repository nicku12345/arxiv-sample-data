Let E be an indecomposable rank two vector bundle on the projective space \PP^n, n \ge 3, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. It is well known that E is arithmetically Buchsbaum if and only if n=3 and E is a null-correlation bundle. In the present paper we establish an analogous result for rank two indecomposable arithmetically Buchsbaum vector bundles on the smooth quadric hypersurface Q_n\subset\PP^{n+1}, n\ge 3. We give in fact a full classification and prove that n must be at most 5. As to k-Buchsbaum rank two vector bundles on Q_3, k\ge2, we prove two boundedness results.
