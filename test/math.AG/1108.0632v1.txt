We compute Okounkov bodies of projective complexity-one T-varieties with respect to two types of invariant flags. In particular, we show that the latter are rational polytopes. Moreover, using results of Dave Anderson and Nathan Ilten, we briefly exhibit explicit links to degenerations and T-deformations. Finally, we prove that the global Okounkov body of a rational projective complexity-one T-variety is rational polyhedral.
