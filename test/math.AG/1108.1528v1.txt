Let Y be a geometrically irreducible reduced projective curve defined over real numbers. Let U_Y (respectively, U'_Y) be the moduli space of geometrically stable torsionfree sheaves (respectively, locally free sheaves) on Y of rank n and degree d. Define \chi\, =\, d+n(1-\text{genus}(Y)), where \text{genus}(Y) is the arithmetic genus. If 2n is coprime to \chi, then there is a Poincare sheaf over U_Y\times Y. If 2n is not coprime to \chi, then there is no Poincare sheaf over any nonempty open subset of U'_Y.
