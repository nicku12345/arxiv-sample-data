Let \GroupG be a connected reductive algebraic group, \GroupH \subsetneq \GroupG a reductive subgroup and \GroupT \subset \GroupG a maximal torus. It is well known that if charactersitic of the ground field is zero, then the homogeneous space \GroupG/\GroupH is a smooth affine variety, but never an affine space. The situation changes when one passes to double coset varieties \dcosets{\GroupF}{\GroupG}{\GroupH}. In this paper we consider the case of \GroupG classical and \GroupH connected spherical and prove that either the double coset variety \dcosets{\GroupT}{\GroupG}{\GroupH} is singular, or it is an affine space. We also list all pairs \GroupH \subset \GroupG such that \dcosets{\GroupT}{\GroupG}{\GroupH} is an affine space.
