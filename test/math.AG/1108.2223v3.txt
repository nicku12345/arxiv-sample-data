Using Gauss-Manin derivatives of normal functions, we arrive at some remarkable results on the non-triviality of the transcendental regulator for K_m of a very general projective algebraic manifold. Our strongest results are for the transcendental regulator for K_1 of a very general K3 surface. We also construct an explicit family of K_1 cycles on H \oplus E_8 \oplus E_8-polarized K3 surfaces, and show they are indecomposable by a direct evaluation of the real regulator. Critical use is made of natural elliptic fibrations, hypersurface normal forms, and an explicit parametrization by modular functions.
