We construct two Lefschetz decompositions of the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Grassmannian of k-dimensional subspaces in a vector space of dimension n. Both of them admit a Lefschetz basis consisting of equivariant vector bundles. We prove fullness of the first decomposition and conjecture it for the second one. In the case when n and k are coprime these decompositions coincide and are minimal. In general, we conjecture minimality of the second decomposition.
