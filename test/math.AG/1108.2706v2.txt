This paper studies the components of the moduli space of rank 1, torsion-free sheaves, or compactified Jacobian, of a non-Gorenstein curve. We exhibit a generically reduced component of dimension equal to the arithmetic genus and prove that this is the only non-smoothable component when the curve has a unique singularity that is of finite representation type. Analogous results are proven for the Hilbert scheme of points and the Quot scheme parameterizing quotients of the dualizing sheaf.
