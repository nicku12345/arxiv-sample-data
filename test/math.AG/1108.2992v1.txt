Let X\subset\A^{2r} be a real curve embedded into an even-dimensional affine space. In the main result of this paper, we characterise when the r-th secant variety to X is an irreducible component of the algebraic boundary of the convex hull of the real points X(\R) of X. This fact is then applied to 4-dimensional SO(2)-orbitopes and to the so called Barvinok-Novik orbitopes to study when they are basic closed as semi-algebraic sets. In the case of 4-dimensional SO(2)-orbitopes, we find all irreducible components of their algebraic boundary.
