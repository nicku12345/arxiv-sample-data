Let X be a complex smooth projective variety, and \mathcal{G} a locally free sheaf on X. We show that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between pairs (\Lambda,\Xi), where \Lambda is a sheaf of almost polynomial filtered algebras over X satisfying Simpson's axioms and \Xi: \Gr\Lambda \rightarrow \Sym^\bullet_{\corO_X} \mathcal{G} is an isomorphism, and pairs (\mathcal{L},\Sigma), where \mathcal{L} is a holomorphic Lie algebroid structure on \mathcal{G} and \Sigma is a class in F^1H^2(\mathcal{L},\C), the first Hodge filtration piece of the second cohomology of \bella.   As an application, we construct moduli spaces of semistable flat \mathcal{L}-connections for any holomorphic Lie algebroid \mathcal{L}. Particular examples of these are given by generalized holomorphic bundles for any generalized complex structure associated to a holomorphic Poisson manifold.
