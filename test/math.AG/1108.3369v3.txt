We give a recursive formula for purely real Welschinger invariants of real Del Pezzo surfaces of degree K^2\ge 3, where in the case of surfaces of degree 3 with two real components we introduce a certain modification of Welschinger invariants and enumerate exclusively the curves traced on the non-orientable component. As an application, we prove the positivity of the invariants under consideration and their logarithmic asymptotic equivalence, as well as congruence modulo 4, to genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants.
