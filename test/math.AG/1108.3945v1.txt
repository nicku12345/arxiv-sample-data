Suppose that the critical locus \Sigma of a complex analytic function f on affine space is, itself, a space with an isolated singular point at the origin \0, and that the Milnor number of f restricted to normal slices of \Sigma-\{\0\} is constant. Then, the general theory of perverse sheaves puts severe restrictions on the cohomology of the Milnor fiber of f at \0, and even more surprising restrictions on the cohomology of the Milnor fiber of generic hyperplane slices.
