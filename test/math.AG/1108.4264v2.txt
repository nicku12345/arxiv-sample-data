Let X\subset \P^N be a nondegenerate irreducible closed subvariety of dimension n over the field of complex numbers and let SX\subset\P^N be its secant variety. X\subset\P^N is called `secant defective' if \dim(SX) is strictly less than the expected dimension 2n+1. In \cite{Z1}, F.L. Zak showed that for a secant defective manifold necessarily N\le{n+2 \choose n}-1 and that the Veronese variety v_2(\P^n) is the only boundary case. Recently R. Mu\tilde{\textrm{n}}oz, J. C. Sierra, and L. E. Sol\'a Conde classified secant defective varieties next to this extremal case in \cite{MSS}.   In this paper, we will consider secant defective manifolds X\subset\P^N of dimension n with N={n+2 \choose n}-1-\epsilon for \epsilon\ge0. First, we will prove that X is a LQEL-manifold of type \delta=1 for \epsilon\le n-2 (see Theorem \ref{main_thm}) by showing that the tangential behavior of X is good enough to apply Scorza lemma. Then we will completely describe the above manifolds by using the classification of conic-connected manifolds given in \cite{IR1}. Our method generalizes previous results in \cite{Z1,MSS}.
