Consider the projective variety X_\lambda of binary forms of degree d whose linear factors are distributed according to the partition \lambda of d. We determine minimal sets of local generators of the fiber product of X_\lambda with its normalization, and we show that the local Jacobian matrices of this product contain the product of the identity matrix of maximal rank with a unit. We use this to fill a gap in a crucial proof in Chipalkatti's "On equations defining Coincident Root Loci". Also, we give a new description of the singular locus of X_\lambda and a criterion for the smoothness of X_\lambda.
