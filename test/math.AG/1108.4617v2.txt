It is known that the main component of the Kontsevich's moduli space of elliptic stable maps is singular. There are two different desingularizations. One is Vakil-Zinger's desingularization and the other is the moduli space of logarithmic stable maps. When the degree is less then or equal to 3 and the target is \mathbb{P}^{n}, we show that the moduli space of logarithmic stable maps can be obtained by blowing up Vakil-Zinger's desingularization.
