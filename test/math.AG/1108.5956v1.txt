In this paper we compute the motivic Donaldson--Thomas invariants for the quiver with one loop and any potential. As the presence of arbitrary potentials requires the full machinery of \hat(\mu)-equivariant motives, we give a detailed account of them. In particular, we will prove two results for the motivic vanishing cycle which might be of importance not only in Donaldson--Thomas theory.
