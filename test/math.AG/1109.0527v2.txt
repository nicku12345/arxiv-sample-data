We partially generalize the theory of semihomogeneous bundles on an abelian variety A developed by Mukai. This involves considering abelian subvarieties Y\subset X_A=A\times\hat{A} and studying coherent sheaves on A invariant under the action of Y. The natural condition to impose on Y is that of being Lagrangian with respect to a certain skew-symmetric biextension of X_A\times X_A. We prove that in this case any Y-invariant sheaf is a direct sum of several copies of a single coherent sheaf. We call such sheaves Lagrangian-invariant (or LI-sheaves). We also study LI-functors D^b(A)\to D^b(B) associated with kernels in D^b(A\times B) that are invariant with respect to some Lagrangian subvariety in X_A\times X_B. We calculate their composition and prove that in characteristic zero it can be decomposed into a direct sum of LI-functors. In the case B=A this leads to an interesting central extension of the group of symplectic automorphisms of X_A in the category of abelian varieties up to isogeny.
