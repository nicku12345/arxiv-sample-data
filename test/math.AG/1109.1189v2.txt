We study the cohomology groups H^1(X,\Theta_X(-mK_X)), for m\geq1, where X is a smooth minimal complex surface of general type, \Theta_X its holomorphic tangent bundle, and K_X its canonical divisor. One of the main results is a precise vanishing criterion for H^1(X,\Theta_X (-K_X)).   The proof is based on the geometric interpretation of non-zero cohomology classes of H^1(X,\Theta_X (-K_X)). This interpretation in turn uses higher rank vector bundles on X.   We apply our methods to the long standing conjecture saying that the irregularity of surfaces in \PP^4 is at most 2. We show that if X has prescribed Chern numbers, no irrational pencil, and is embedded in \PP^4 with a sufficiently large degree, then the irregularity of X is at most 3.
