The Fano surface F of lines in the cubic threefold V is naturally embedded in the intermediate Jacobian J(V), we call "Fano cycle" the difference F-F^-, this is homologous to 0 in J(V). We study the normal function on the moduli space which computes the Abel-Jacobi image of the Fano cycle. By means of the related infinitesimal invariant we can prove that the primitive part of the normal function is not of torsion. As a consequence we get that, for a general V, F-F^- in not algebraically equivalent to zero in J(V) (already proved by van der Geer-Kouvidakis) and, moreover, there is no a divisor in JV containing both F and F^- and such that these surfaces are homologically equivalent in the divisor.   Our study of the infinitesimal variation of Hodge structure for V produces intrinsically a threefold \Xi (V) in \mathbb G the Grasmannian of lines in \mathbb P^4. We show that the infinitesimal invariant at V attached to the normal function gives a section for a natural bundle on \Xi(V) and more specifically that this section vanishes exactly on \Xi\cap F, which turns out to be the curve in F parameterizing the "double lines" in the threefold. We prove that this curve reconstructs V and hence we get a Torelli-like result: the infinitesimal invariant for the Fano cycle determines V.
