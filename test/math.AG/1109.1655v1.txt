Over the last decade, implementations of several desingularization algorithms have appeared in various contexts. These differ as widely in their methods and in their practical efficiency as they differ in the situations in which they may be applied. The purpose of this article is to give a brief overview over a selection of these approaches and the applicability of the respective implementations in Singular.
