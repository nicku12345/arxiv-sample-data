Given \mathbb P^4_k, with k algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, and X\subset \mathbb P^4_k integral surface of degree d, let Y=X\cap H be the general hyperplane section of X. We suppose that h^0\mathscr I_Y(s)\ne 0 and h^0\mathscr I_X(s)=0 for some s>0. This determines a nonzero element \alpha\in H^1\mathscr I_X(s) such that \alpha\cdot H=0 in H^1\mathscr I_X(s). We find different upper bounds of d in terms of s, p and the order of \alpha and we show that these bounds are sharp. In particular, we see that d\le s^2 for p<s and d\le s^2-s+2 for p\ge s.
