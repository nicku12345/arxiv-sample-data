Guided by evidence coming from a few key examples and attempting to unify previous work of Chudnovsky, Esnault-Viehweg, Eisenbud-Mazur, Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith, Hochster-Huneke and Bocci-Harbourne, Harbourne and Huneke recently formulated a series of conjectures that relate symbolic and regular powers of ideals of fat points in {\bf P}^N. In this paper we propose another conjecture along the same lines (Conjecture 3.9), and we verify it and the conjectures of Harbourne and Huneke for a variety of configurations of points.
