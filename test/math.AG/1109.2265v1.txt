We determine conditions on q for the nonexistence of deep holes of the standard Reed-Solomon code of dimension k over F_q generated by polynomials of degree k+d. Our conditions rely on the existence of q-rational points with nonzero, pairwise-distinct coordinates of a certain family of hypersurfaces defined over F_q. We show that the hypersurfaces under consideration are invariant under the action of the symmetric group of permutations of the coordinates. This allows us to obtain critical information concerning the singular locus of these hypersurfaces, from which the existence of q-rational points is established.
