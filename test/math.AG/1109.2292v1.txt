Symplectic instanton vector bundles on the projective space \mathbb{P}^3 constitute a natural generalization of mathematical instantons of rank 2. We study the moduli space I_{n,r} of rank-2r symplectic instanton vector bundles on \mathbb{P}^3 with r\ge2 and second Chern class n\ge r,\ n\equiv r({\rm mod}2). We give an explicit construction of an irreducible component I^*_{n,r} of this space for each such value of n and show that I^*_{n,r} has the expected dimension 4n(r+1)-r(2r+1).
