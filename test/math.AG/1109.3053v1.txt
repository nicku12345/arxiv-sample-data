We show the existence of a full exceptional collection in the graded stable derived category of a Gorenstein isolated quotient singularity using a result of Orlov (arXiv:math/0503632). We also show that the equivariant graded stable derived category of a Gorenstein Veronese subring of a polynomial ring with respect to an action of a finite group has a full strong exceptional collection, even if the corresponding quotient singularity is neither isolated nor Gorenstein.
