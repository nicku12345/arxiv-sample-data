In this paper, we will first show that, the homogeneous polynomials which satisfy the Jacobian condition are injective on the lines that pass through the origin. Secondly, we will show that F and G' are paired, where F is a Druzkowski map and G' is a cubic homogeneous polynomial which related to F. Finally, we will find a more exactly bound for the degree of F^{-1}, where F is a invertible map.
