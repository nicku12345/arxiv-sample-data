The thesis deals with calculating the Picard-Fuchs equation of special one-parameter families of invertible polynomials. In particular, for an invertible polynomial g(x_1,...,x_n) we consider the family f(x_1,...,x_n)=g(x_1,...,x_n)+s\cdot\prod x_i, where s denotes the parameter. For the families of hypersurfaces defined by these polynomials, we compute the Picard-Fuchs equation, i.e. the ordinary differential equation which solutions are exactly the period integrals. For the proof of the exact appearance of the Picard-Fuchs equation we use a combinatorial version of the Griffiths-Dwork method and the theory of \GKZ systems. As consequences of our work and facts from the literature, we show the relation between the Picard-Fuchs equation, the Poincar\'{e} series and the monodromy in the space of period integrals.
