As proved recently in [PT], for varieties X^{r+1}\subset \mathbb P^N such that through n\geq 2 general points there passes an irreducible curve C of degree \delta\geq n-1 we have N\leq \pi(r,n,\delta+r(n-1)+2), where \pi(r,n,d) is the Castelnuovo-Harris bound function for the geometric genus of an irreducible non-degenerate variety Y^r\subset\mathbb P^{n+r-1} of degree d. A lot of examples of varieties as in the title and attaining the previous bound for the embedding dimension are constructed from Castelnuovo varieties and were thus dubbed {\it of Castelnuovo type} in [PT], where it is also proved that all extremal varieties as above are of this kind, except possibly when n>2, r>1 and \delta=2n-3.   One of the main results of the paper is the classification of extremal varieties X^{r+1}\subset \mathbb P^{2r+3} 3-covered by twisted cubics and not of Castelnuovo type. Interesting examples are provided by the so called {\it twisted cubics over complex Jordan algebras of rank 3}, as pointed out by Mukai. By relating to an extremal variety 3-covered by twisted cubics, via tangential projection, a quadro-quadric Cremona transformation in \mathbb P^r we are able to classify all these object either for r\leq 4 or under the smoothness assumption. In the last case we obtain that they are either smooth rational normal scrolls (hence of Castelnuovo type) or the Segre embeddings of \p^1\times Q^r or one of the four Lagrangian Grassmannians. We end by discussing some open problems pointing towards the equivalence of these apparently unrelated objects: extremal varieties 3-covered by twisted cubics, quadro-quadric Cremona transformations of \mathbb P^r and complex Jordan algebras of dimension r+1 and of rank three.
