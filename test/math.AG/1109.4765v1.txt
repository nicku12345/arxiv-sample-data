Let Y be a submanifold of dimension y of a polarized complex manifold (X,A) of dimension k\geq 3, with 1\leq y\leq k-1. We define and study two positivity conditions on Y in (X,A), called Seshadri A-bigness and (a stronger one) Seshadri A-ampleness. In this way we get the natural generalization of the theory initiated by Paoletti in \cite{Pao} (which corresponds to the case (k,y)=(3,1)) and subsequently generalized and completed in   \cite{BBF} (regarding curves in a polarized manifold of arbitrary dimension). The theory presented here, which is new even if y=k-1, is motivated by a reasonably large area of examples.
