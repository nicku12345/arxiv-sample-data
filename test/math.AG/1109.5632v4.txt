We study horizontal subvarieties Z of a Griffiths period domain \mathbb D. If Z is defined by algebraic equations, and if Z is also invariant under a large discrete subgroup in an appropriate sense, we prove that Z is a Hermitian symmetric domain \mathcal D, embedded via a totally geodesic embedding in \mathbb D. Next we discuss the case when Z is in addition of Calabi-Yau type. We classify the possible VHS of Calabi-Yau type parametrized by Hermitian symmetric domains \mathcal D and show that they are essentially those found by Gross and Sheng-Zuo, up to taking factors of symmetric powers and certain shift operations. In the weight three case, we explicitly describe the embedding Z\hookrightarrow \mathbb D from the perspective of Griffiths transversality and relate this description to the Harish-Chandra realization of \mathcal D and to the Kor\'anyi-Wolf tube domain description. There are further connections to homogeneous Legendrian varieties and the four Severi varieties of Zak.
