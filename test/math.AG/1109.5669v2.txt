S. Kondo has constructed a ball quotient compactification for the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic genus four curves. In this paper, we show that this space essentially coincides with a GIT quotient of the Chow variety of canonically embedded genus four curves. More specifically, we give an explicit description of this GIT quotient, and show that the birational map from this space to Kondo's space is resolved by the blow-up of a single point. This provides a modular interpretation of the points in the boundary of Kondo's space. Connections with the slope nine space in the Hassett-Keel program are also discussed.
