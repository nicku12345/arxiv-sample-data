The Euler obstruction of a function can be viewed as a generalization of the Milnor number for functions defined on singular spaces. In this work, using the Euler obstruction of a function, we give a version of the L\^e-Greuel formula for two germs of analytic functions with isolated singularity at the origin on a singular space. Using this formula and results of Loeser, we also present an integral formula for the Euler obstruction of a function, generalizing a formula of Kennedy.
