In this paper we consider the Brill-Noether locus W_{\underline d}(C) of line bundles of multidegree \underline d of total degree g-1 having a nonzero section on a nodal reducible curve C of genus g\geq2. We give an explicit description of the irreducible components of W_{\underline d}(C) for a semistable multidegre \underline d. As a consequence we show that, if two semistable multidegrees of total degre g-1 on a curve with no rational components differ by a twister, then the respective Brill-Noether loci have isomorphic components.
