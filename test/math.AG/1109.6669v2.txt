Let X be an orthogonal Grassmannian parametrizing isotropic subspaces in an even dimensional vector space equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric form. We prove a Giambelli formula which expresses an arbitrary Schubert class in the singular and quantum cohomology ring of X as a polynomial in certain special Schubert classes. Our analysis reveals a surprising relation between the Schubert calculus on even and odd orthogonal Grassmannians. We also study eta polynomials, a family of polynomials defined using raising operators whose algebra agrees with the Schubert calculus on X.
