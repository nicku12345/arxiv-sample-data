We classify the cohomology classes of Lagrangian 4-planes \P^4 in a smooth manifold X deformation equivalent to a Hilbert scheme of 4 points on a K3 surface, up to the monodromy action. Classically, the cone of effective curves on a K3 surface S is generated by nonegative classes C, for which (C,C)\geq0, and nodal classes C, for which (C,C)=-2; Hassett and Tschinkel conjecture that the cone of effective curves on a holomorphic symplectic variety X is similarly controlled by "nodal" classes C such that (C,C)=-\gamma, for (\cdot,\cdot) now the Beauville-Bogomolov form, where \gamma classifies the geometry of the extremal contraction associated to C. In particular, they conjecture that for X deformation equivalent to a Hilbert scheme of n points on a K3 surface, the class C=\ell of a line in a smooth Lagrangian n-plane \P^n must satisfy (\ell,\ell)=-\frac{n+3}{2}. We prove the conjecture for n=4 by computing the ring of monodromy invariants on X, and showing there is a unique monodromy orbit of Lagrangian 4-planes.
