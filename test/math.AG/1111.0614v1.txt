In this sequel to arxiv:arXiv:1012.0835 we develop Bezout type theorems for semidegrees (including an explicit formula for {\em iterated semidegrees}) and an inequality for subdegrees. In addition we prove (in case of surfaces) a Bernstein type theorem for the number of solutions of two polynomials in terms of the mixed volume of planar convex polygons associated to them (via the theory of Kaveh-Khovanskii and Lazarsfeld-Mustata.
