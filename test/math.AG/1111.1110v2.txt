The conchoid of a surface F with respect to given fixed point O is roughly speaking the surface obtained by increasing the radius function with respect to O by a constant. This paper studies {\it conchoid surfaces of spheres} and shows that these surfaces admit rational parameterizations. Explicit parameterizations of these surfaces are constructed using the relations to pencils of quadrics in \R^3 and \R^4. Moreover we point to remarkable geometric properties of these surfaces and their construction.
