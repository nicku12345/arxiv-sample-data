We consider quadric surface fibrations over curves, defined over algebraically closed and finite fields. Our goal is to understand, in geometric terms, spaces of sections for such fibrations. We analyze varieties of maximal isotropic subspaces in the fibers as P^1-bundles over the discriminant double cover. When the P^1-bundle is suitably stable, we deduce effective estimates for the heights of sections over finite fields satisfying various approximation conditions. We also discuss the behavior of the spaces of sections as the base of the fibration acquires singularities.
