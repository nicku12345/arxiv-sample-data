In this paper we consider the Hilbert scheme Hilb_{p(t)}^n parameterizing subschemes of P^n with Hilbert polynomial p(t), and we investigate its locus containing points corresponding to schemes with regularity lower than or equal to a fixed integer r'. This locus is an open subscheme of Hilb_{p(t)}^n and, for every s\geq r', we describe it as a locally closed subscheme of the Grasmannian Gr_{p(s)}^{N(s)} given by a set of equations of degree \leq \mathrm{deg}(p(t))+2 and linear inequalities in the coordinates of the Pl\"ucker embedding.
