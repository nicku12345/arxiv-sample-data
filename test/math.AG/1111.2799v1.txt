In this paper we study the extension of structure group of principal bundles with a reductive algebraic group as structure group on smooth projective varieties defined over algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. Our main result is to show that given a representation {\rho} of a reductive algebraic group G, there exists an integer t such that any semistable G-bundle whose first t frobenius pullbacks are semistable induces a semistable vector bundle on extension of structure group via {\rho}. Moreover we quantify the number of such frobenius pullbacks required.
