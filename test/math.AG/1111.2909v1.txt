Let f be a map-germ of corank 1 from complex n-space to complex (n+1)-space, and, for k less than or equal to the multiplicity of f, let D^k(f) be its k'th multiple-point scheme -- the closure of the set of ordered k-tuples of pairwise distinct points sharing the same image. There are natural projections from D^{k+1}(f) to D^k(f), determined by forgetting one member of the (k+1)-tuple. We prove that the matrix of a presentation of \OO_{D^{k+1}(f)} over \OO_{D^k(f)} appears as a certain submatrix of the matrix of a suitable presentation of \OO_{\CC^n} over \OO_{\CC^{n+1}}. This does not happen for germs of corank greater than 1.
