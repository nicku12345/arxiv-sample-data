Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, W the ring of Witt vectors over k and {R} the integral closure of W in the algebraic closure {\bar{K}} of K:=Frac(W); let moreover X be a smooth, connected and projective scheme over W and H a relatively very ample line bundle over X. We prove that when dim(X/{W})\geq 2 there exists an integer d_0, depending only on X, such that for any d\geq d_0, any Y\in |H^{\otimes d}| connected and smooth over {W} and any y\in Y({W}) the natural {R}-morphism of fundamental group schemes \pi_1(Y_R,y_R)\to \pi_1(X_R,y_R) is faithfully flat, X_R, Y_R, y_R being respectively the pull back of X, Y, y over Spec(R). If moreover dim(X/{W})\geq 3 then there exists an integer d_1, depending only on X, such that for any d\geq d_1, any Y\in |H^{\otimes d}| connected and smooth over {W} and any section y\in Y({W}) the morphism \pi_1(Y_R,y_R)\to \pi_1(X_R,y_R) is an isomorphism.
