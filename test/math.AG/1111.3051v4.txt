Let (S,H) be a general primitively polarized K3 surface of genus \p and let p_a(nH) be the arithmetic genus of nH. We prove the existence in |\mathcal O_S(nH)| of curves with a triple point and A_k-singularities. In particular, we show the existence of curves of geometric genus g in |\mathcal O_S(nH)| with a triple point and nodes as singularities and corresponding to regular points of their equisingular deformation locus, for every 1\leq g\leq p_a(nH)-3 and (\p,n)\neq (4,1). Our result is obtained by studying the versal deformation space of a non-planar quadruple point.
