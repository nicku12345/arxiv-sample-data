Recently Abouzaid, Auroux, Efimov, Katzarkov and Orlov showed that the wrapped Fukaya Categories of punctured spheres and finite unbranched covers of punctured spheres are derived equivalent to the categories of singularities of a superpotential on certain crepant resolutions of toric 3 dimensional singularities. We generalize this result to other punctured Riemann surfaces and reformulate it in terms of certain noncommutative algebras coming from dimer models. In particular, given any consistent dimer model we can look at a subcategory of noncommutative matrix factorizations and show that this category is A_\infty-isomorphic to a subcategory of the wrapped Fukaya category of a punctured Riemann surface. The connection between the dimer model and the punctured Riemann surface then has a nice interpretation in terms of a duality on dimer models.
