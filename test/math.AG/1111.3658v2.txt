Let k be a field and let \Omega be a universal domain over k. Let f:X \r S be a dominant morphism defined over k from a smooth projective variety X to a smooth projective variety S of dimension \leq 2 such that the general fibre of f_\Omega has trivial Chow group of zero-cycles. For example, X could be the total space of a two-dimensional family of varieties whose general member is rationally connected. Suppose that X has dimension \leq 4. Then we prove that X has a self-dual Murre decomposition, i.e. that X has a self-dual Chow--Kuenneth decomposition which satisfies Murre's conjectures (B) and (D). Moreover we prove that the motivic Lefschetz conjecture holds for X and hence so does the Lefschetz standard conjecture. We also give new examples of threefolds of general type which are Kimura finite-dimensional, new examples of fourfolds of general type having a self-dual Murre decomposition, as well as new examples of varieties with finite degree three unramified cohomology.
