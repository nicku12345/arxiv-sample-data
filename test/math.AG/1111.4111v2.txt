In this work we provide effective bounds and classification results for rational \QQ-factorial Fano varieties with a complexity-one torus action and Picard number one depending on the invariants dimension and Picard index. This complements earlier work by Hausen, S\"u{\ss} and the author, where the case of free divisor class group of rank one was treated.
