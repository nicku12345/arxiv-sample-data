We discuss some aspects of the behavior of specialization at a finite place of N\'eron-Severi groups of K3 surfaces over number fields. We give optimal lower bounds for the Picard number of such specializations, thus answering a question of Elsenhans and Jahnel. As a consequence of these results, we show that it is possible to explicitly compute the Picard number of any given K3 surface over a number field.
