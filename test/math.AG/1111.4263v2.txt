We give formulas for the extension groups between tautological sheaves and more general between tautological objects twisted by a determinant line bundle on the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth quasi-projective surface. We do this using L. Scala's results about the image of tautological sheaves under the Bridgeland-King-Reid equivalence. We also compute the Yoneda products in terms of these formulas.
