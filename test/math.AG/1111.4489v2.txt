Let X be a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus g\geq 2 defined over a field K. We show that X can be defined over its field of moduli if it has odd signature, i.e. if the signature of the covering X\to X/\Aut(X) is of type (0;c_1,...,c_k), where some c_i appears an odd number of times. This result is applied to q-gonal curves and to plane quartics. For q-gonal curves, we prove that non-normal q-gonal curves can be defined over their field of moduli and we construct examples of normal q-gonal curves with field of moduli \mathbb{R} that can not be defined over \mathbb{R}. For plane quartics, we prove that they can be defined over their field of moduli if the automorphism group is not isomorphic to either C_2 or C_2\times C_2.
