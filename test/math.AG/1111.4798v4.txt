In this paper, we studied the map defined by a non-very ample line bundle on some special irregular varieties. As to this topic, it is well known that for a line bundle L on an Abelian variety A, the linear system |2L| is base point free, and 3L is very ample, moreover the map defined by the linear system |2L| is well understood (cf. Theorem \ref{oldth}). First, we generalized this classical result to projective bundles over Abelian varieties (cf. Theorem \ref{key}). Then we studied the bicanonical map of an irregular primitive variety X of general type with dim(X) = q(X), in fact we got a relation between the map and the reducibility of a divisor.
