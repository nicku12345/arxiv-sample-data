Let G be a complex affine algebraic group and H, F \subset G be closed subgroups. The homogeneous space G / H can be equipped with structure of a smooth quasiprojective variety. The situation is different for double coset varieties \dcosets{F}{G}{H}. In this paper we give examples showing that the variety \dcosets{F}{G}{H} does not necessarily exist. We also address the question of existence of \dcosets{F}{G}{H} in the category of constructible spaces and show that under sufficiently general assumptions \dcosets{F}{G}{H} does exist as a constructible space.
