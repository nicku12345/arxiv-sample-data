Given a Mumford curve X over \bar{\mathbb Q_p}, we show that for every semistable model \mathcal X of X and every closed point x of this semistable model, there exists a finite \'etale cover Y of X such that every semistable model of Y has a vertical component above X. We then give applications of this to the tempered fundamental group. In particular, we prove that two punctured Tate curves \bar{\mathbb Q_p} with isomorphic tempered fundamental groups are isomorphic over \mathbb Q_p.
