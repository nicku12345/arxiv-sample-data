We prove the existence of three irreducible curves C_{12,m} of degree 12 with the same number of cusps and different Alexander polynomials. This exhibits a Zariski triple. Moreover we provide a set of generators for the elliptic threefold with constant j-invariant 0 and discriminant curve C_{12,m}. Finally we consider general degree d base change of C_{12d,m} and calculate the dimension of the equisingular deformation space.
