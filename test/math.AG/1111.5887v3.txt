In this note, we prove that for every ordinary genus-2 curve X over a finite field \kappa of characteristic 2 with \text{Aut}(X/\kappa)=\db{Z}/2\db{Z} \times S_3, there exist \text{SL}(2,\kappa\sembrack{s})-representations of \pi_1(X) such that the image of \pi_1(\bar{X}) is infinite. This result gives a geometric interpretation of Laszlo's counterexample [12] to a question regarding the finiteness of the geometric monodromy of representations of the fundamental group [4].
