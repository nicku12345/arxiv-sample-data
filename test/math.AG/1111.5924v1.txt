In this article, examples of Zariski pairs (B_1, B_2) satisfying the following condition are given: (i) \deg B_1 = \deg B_2 = 7. (ii) Irreducible components of B_i (i = 1, 2) are lines and conics. (iii) Singularities of B_i (i = 1, 2) are nodes, tacnodes and ordinary triple points.   In order to construct B_i (i = 1, 2), we make use of geometry of sections of rational elliptic surfaces and their group structure. Dihedral covers play important roles to distinguish the topology of ({\mathbb P}^2, B_i) (i = 1, 2).
