We shall study some moduli spaces of Bridgeland's semi-stable objects on abelian surfaces and K3 surfaces with Picard number 1. Under some conditions, we show that the moduli spaces are isomorphic to the moduli spaces of Gieseker semi-stable sheaves. We also study the ample cone of the moduli spaces.
