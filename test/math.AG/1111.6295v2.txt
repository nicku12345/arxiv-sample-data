We solve the problem of counting elliptic curves with fixed j-invariant in projective space with tangency conditions. This is equivalent to couting rational nodal curves with condition on the node of the image. The solution is given in the form of effective recursions. We give explicit formulas when the dimension of the ambient projective space is at most 5. Many numerical examples are provided. A C++ program implementing most of the recursions is available on the author's webpage (see \cite{dn}).
