In this paper, we give a Prym-Tjurin construction for the cohomology and the Chow groups for a cubic hypersurface. On the space of lines meeting a given rational curve, there is the incidence correspondence. This correspondence induces an action on both of the primitive cohomology and the primitive Chow groups. We first show that this action satisfies a quadratic equation. Then the Abel-Jacobi homomorphism induces an isomorphism between the primitive cohomology of the cubic hypersurface and the Prym-Tjurin part of the above action. This also holds for Chow groups with rational coefficients.
