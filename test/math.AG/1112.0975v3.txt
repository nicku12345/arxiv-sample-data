We prove that a normal variety contains finitely many maximal quasi-projective open subvarieties. As a corollary, we obtain the following generalization of the Chevalley-Kleiman projectivity criterion : a normal variety is quasi-projective if and only if every finite subset is contained in an affine open subvariety. The proof builds on a strategy of Wlodarczyk, using results of Boissiere, Gabber and Serman.
