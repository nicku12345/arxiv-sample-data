In this article we survey and examine the realizability of p-groups as Galois groups over arbitrary fields. In particular we consider various cohomological criteria that lead to necessary and sufficient conditions for the realizability of such a group as a Galois group, the embedding problem (i.e., realizability over a given subextension), descriptions of such extensions, automatic realizations among p-groups, and related topics.
