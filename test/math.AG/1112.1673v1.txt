This is a pdf print of the homonymous Maple file, freely available at http://www.maplesoft.com/applications/view.aspx?SID=127621, providing procedures which are able to produce the toric data associated with a (polarized) weighted projective space i.e. fans, polytopes and their equivalences. More originally it provides procedures which are able to detect a weights vector Q starting from either a fan or a polytope: we will call this process the recognition of a (polarized) weighted projective space. Moreover it gives procedures connecting polytopes of a polarized weighted projective space with an associated fan and viceversa.
