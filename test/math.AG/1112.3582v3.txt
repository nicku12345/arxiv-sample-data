We study the Fourier-Mukai transform for holonomic D-modules on a complex abelian variety. Among other things, we show that the cohomology support loci of a holonomic complex are finite unions of translates of triple tori, the translates being by torsion points for objects of geometric origin; and that the standard t-structure on the derived category of holonomic complexes corresponds, under the Fourier-Mukai transform, to a certain perverse coherent t-structure in the sense of Kashiwara and Arinkin-Bezrukavnikov.
