Let G be a reductive algebraic group over a perfect field k and \cG a G-bundle over a scheme X/k. The main aim of this article is to study the motive associated with \cG, inside the Veovodsky Motivic categories. We consider the case that \charakt k=0 (resp. \charakt k\geq 0), the motive associated to X is geometrically mixed Tate (resp. geometrically cellular) and \cG is locally trivial for the Zariski (resp. \'etale) topology on X and show that the motive of \cG is geometrically mixed Tate. Moreover for a general X we construct a nested filtration on the motive associated to \cG in terms of weight polytopes. Along the way we give some applications and examples.
