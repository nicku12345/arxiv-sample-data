In this paper we address Fano foliations on complex projective varieties. These are foliations whose anti-canonical class is ample. We focus our attention on a special class of Fano foliations, namely del Pezzo foliations on complex projective manifolds. We show that these foliations are algebraically integrable, with one exceptional case when the ambient space is a projective space. We also provide a classification of del Pezzo foliations with mild singularities.
