This submission replaces the arXiv:1012.5381 submission with the same title, which had been withdrawn as it contained a mistake, repaired in this submission: on X projective smooth over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, we show that all irreducible stratified bundles have rank 1 if and only if the commutator [\pi_1, \pi_1] of the \'etale fundamental group \pi_1 is a pro-p-group, and we show that the category of stratified bundles is semi-simple with irreducible objects of rank 1 if and only if  \pi_1  is abelian without p-power quotient. This answers positively a conjecture by Gieseker.
