The present paper proves that finite symplectic groups of automorphisms of hyperk\"ahler fourfolds deformation equivalent to the Hilbert scheme of two points on a K3 surface are contained in the simple group Co_1. Then we give an example of a symplectic automorphism of order 11 on the Fano scheme of lines of a cubic fourfold.
