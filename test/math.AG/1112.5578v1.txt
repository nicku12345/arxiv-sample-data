For a local singular plane curve germ f(X,Y)=0 we characterize all nonsingular \lambda\in\bbC\{X,Y\} such that the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent of \grad\,f is not attained on the polar curve \bJ(\lambda,f)=0. When f is not Morse we prove that for the same \lambda's the maximal polar quotient q_0(f,\lambda) is strictly less than its generic value q_0(f). Our main tool is the Eggers tree of singularity constructed as a decorated graph of relations between balls in the space of branches defined by using a logarithmic distance.
