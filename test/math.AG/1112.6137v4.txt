Let A_g^S be the Satake compactification of the moduli space A_g of principally polarized abelian g-folds and M_g^S the closure of the image of the moduli space M_g of genus g curves in A_g under the Jacobian morphism. Then A_g^S lies in the boundary of A_{g+m}^S for any m. We prove that M_{g+m}^S and A_g^S do not meet transversely in A_{g+m}^S, but rather that their intersection contains the mth order infinitesimal neighbourhood of M_g^S in A_g^S. We deduce that there is no non-trivial stable Siegel modular form that vanishes on M_g for every g. In particular, given two inequivalent positive even unimodular quadratic forms P and Q, there is a curve whose period matrix distinguishes between the theta series of P and Q.
