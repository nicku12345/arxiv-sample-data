Let S be a smooth minimal surface of general type with a (rational) pencil of hyperelliptic curves of minimal genus g. We prove that if K_S^2<4\chi(\mathcal O_S)-6, then g is bounded. The surface S is determined by the branch locus of the covering S\rightarrow S/i, where i is the hyperelliptic involution of S. For K_S^2<3\chi(\mathcal O_S)-6, we show how to determine the possibilities for this branch curve. As an application, given g>4 and K_S^2-3\chi(\mathcal O_S)<-6, we compute the maximum value for \chi(\mathcal O_S). This list of possibilities is sharp.
