We construct a fully equivariant correspondence between Gromov-Witten and stable pairs descendent theories for toric 3-folds X. Our method uses geometric constraints on descendents, A_n surfaces, and the topological vertex. The rationality of the stable pairs descendent theory plays a crucial role in the definition of the correspondence. We prove our correspondence has a non-equivariant limit.   As a result of the construction, we prove an explicit non-equivariant stationary descendent correspondence for X (conjectured previously by MNOP). Using descendent methods, we establish the relative GW/Pairs correspondence for X/D in several basic new log Calabi-Yau geometries. Among the consequences is a rationality constraint for non-equivariant descendent Gromov-Witten series for P^3.
