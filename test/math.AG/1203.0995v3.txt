The global log canonical threshold of each non-singular complex del Pezzo surface was computed by Cheltsov. The proof used Koll\'ar-Shokurov's connectedness principle and other results relying on vanishing theorems of Kodaira type, not known to be true in finite characteristic.   We compute the global log canonical threshold of non-singular del Pezzo surfaces over an algebraically closed field. We give algebraic proofs of results previously known only in characteristic 0. Instead of using of the connectedness principle we introduce a new technique based on a classification of curves of low degree. As an application we conclude that non-singular del Pezzo surfaces in finite characteristic of degree lower or equal than 4 are K-semistable.
