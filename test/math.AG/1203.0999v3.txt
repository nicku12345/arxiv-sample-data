Let K be a field of characteristic zero. We describe an algorithm which requires a homogeneous polynomial F of degree three in K[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3] and a zero A of F in P^3_K and ensures a linear pfaffian representation of V(F) with entries in K[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3], under mild assumptions on F and A. We use this result to give an explicit construction of (and to prove the existence of) a linear pfaffian representation of V(F), with entries in K'[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3], being K' an algebraic extension of K of degree at most six. An explicit example of such a construction is given.
