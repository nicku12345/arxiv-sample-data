We consider moduli stacks of Bridgeland semistable objects that previously had only set-theoretic identifications with Uhlenbeck compactification spaces. On a K3 surface X, we give examples where such a moduli stack is isomorphic to a moduli stack of slope semistable locally free sheaves on the Fourier-Mukai partner \hat{X}. This yields a morphism from the stack of Bridgeland semistable objects to a projective scheme, which induces an injection on closed points. It also allows us to extend a theorem of Bruzzo-Maciocia on Hilbert schemes to a statement on moduli of complexes.
