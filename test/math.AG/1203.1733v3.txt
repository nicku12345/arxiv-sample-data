A Mustafin degeneration is a degeneration of a flag variety induced by a vertex configuration in the Bruhat-Tits building of the projective linear group over a field with a non-archimedean discrete valuation. In the case where the flag type is projective space, Mustafin degenerations have been studied previously. We generalize the construction to the case of arbitrary flag types. We examine the special fiber of a Mustafin degeneration for reducedness and study the behavior of its components under a natural projection morphism between Mustafin degenerations, which arises from the inclusion of flags.
