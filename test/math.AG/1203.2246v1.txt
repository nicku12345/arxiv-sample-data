In a previous paper, we provided some update in the treatment of the finiteness theorem for rational maps of finite degree from a fixed variety to varieties of general type. In the present paper we present another improvement, introducing the natural parametrization of maps by means of the space of linear projections in a suitable projective space, and this leads to some new insight in the geometry of the finiteness theorem.
