In this article we prove a result comparing rationality of integral algebraic cycles over the function field of a quadric and over the base field. This is an integral version of the result known for coefficients modulo 2. Those results have already been proved by Alexander Vishik in the case of characteristic 0, which allowed him to work with algebraic cobordism theory. Our proofs use the modulo 2 Steenrod operations in the Chow theory and work in any characteristic different from 2.
