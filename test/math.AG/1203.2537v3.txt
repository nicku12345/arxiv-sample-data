In this paper we study the p-adic analytic geometry of the basic unitary group Rapoport-Zink spaces \M_K with signature (1,n-1). Using the theory of Harder-Narasimhan filtration of finite flat groups developed by Fargues in \cite{F2},\cite{F3}, and the Bruhat-Tits stratification of the reduced special fiber \M_{red} defined by Vollaard-Wedhorn in \cite{VW}, we find some relatively compact fundamental domain \D_K in \M_K for the action of G(\Q_p)\times J_b(\Q_p), the product of the associated p-adic reductive groups, and prove that \M_K admits a locally finite cell decomposition. By considering the action of regular elliptic elements on these cells, we establish a Lefschetz trace formula for these spaces by applying Mieda's main theorem in \cite{Mi2}.
