Let f : X -> B be a projective surjective morphism between quasi-projective varieties. The goal of this paper is the study of the Chow groups of X in terms of the Chow groups of B and of the fibers of f. One of the applications concerns quadric bundles. When X and B are smooth projective and when f is a flat quadric fibration, we show that the motive of X is "built" from the motives of varieties of dimension less than the dimension of B.
