Let f : X \rightarrow B be a proper flat dominant morphism between two smooth quasi-projective complex varieties X and B. Assume that there exists an integer l such that all closed fibres X_b of f satisfy CH_j(X_b) = \Q for all j \leq l. Then we prove an analogue of the projective bundle formula for CH_i(X) for i \leq l. When B is a surface, X is projective and l = \lfloor \frac{\dim X - 3}{2} \rfloor, this makes it possible to construct a Chow-K\"unneth decomposition for X that satisfies Murre's conjectures. For instance we prove Murre's conjectures for complex smooth projective varieties X fibred over a surface (via a flat morphism) by quadrics, or by complete intersections of dimension 4 of bidegree (2,2).
