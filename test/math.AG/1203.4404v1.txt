A solution for an initial value problem of the box and ball system is constructed from a solution of the periodic box and ball system. The construction is done through a specific limiting process based on the theory of tropical geometry. This method gives a tropical analogue of the Krichever construction, which is an algebro-geometric method to construct exact solutions to integrable systems, for the non-periodic system.
