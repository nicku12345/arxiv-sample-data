Let {\mathcal L}/{\mathcal K} be a finite Galois extension and let X be an affine algebraic variety defined over {\mathcal L}. Weil's Galois descent theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for X to be definable over {\mathcal K}, that is, for the existence of an algebraic variety Y defined over {\mathcal K} together with a birational isomorphism R:X \to Y defined over {\mathcal L}. Weil's proof does not provide a method to construct the birational isomorphism R. The aim of this paper is to give an explicit construction of R.
