We discuss the variations of mixed Hodge structure for cohomology with compact support of quasi-projective simple normal crossing pairs. We show that they are graded polarizable admissible variations of mixed Hodge structure. Then we prove a generalization of the Fujita--Kawamata semi-positivity theorem.
