We study a property of cycle spaces in connection with degenerating Hodge structures of odd-weight, and construct maps from some partial compactifications of period domains to the Satake compatifications of Siegel spaces. These maps are a generalization of the maps from the toroidal compactifications of Siegel spaces to the Satake compactifications. We also show the continuity of these maps for the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds with h^{2,1}=1.
