In this paper, we investigate the necessary sufficient conditions for the exactness of the homotopy sequence of Nori's fundamental group and apply these to various special situations to regain some classical theorems and give a counter example to show the conditions are not always satisfied. This work partially bases on the earlier work of H.Esnault, P.H.Hai, E.Viehweg.
