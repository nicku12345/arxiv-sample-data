Let G be a connected reductive complex algebraic group acting on a smooth complete complex algebraic variety X. We assume that X under the action of G is a regular embedding, a condition satisfied in particular by smooth toric varieties and flag varieties. For any set D of G-stable prime divisors, we study the action on X of the connected automorphism group of X stabilizing D. We determine a Levi subgroup A of this automorphism group, and we compute relevant invariants of X as a spherical A-variety. As a byproduct, we obtain a description of the open A-orbit on X and the inclusion relation between A-orbit closures.
