We prove uniruledness of some moduli spaces \bar{M}_{g,n} of stable curves of genus g with n marked points using linear systems on nonsingular projective surfaces containing the general curve of genus g. Precisely we show that \bar{M}_{g,n} is uniruled for g=12 and n \leq 5, g=13 and n \leq 3, g=15 and n \leq 2. We then prove that the pointed hyperelliptic locus H_{g,n} is uniruled for g \geq 2 and n \leq 4g+4. In the last part we show that a nonsingular complete intersection surface does not carry a linear system containing the general curve of genus g \geq 16 and if it carries a linear system containing the general curve of genus 12 \leq g \leq 15 then it is canonical.
