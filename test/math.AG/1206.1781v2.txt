We revisit Ekedahl, Lando, Shapiro and Vainshtein's compactification of the stack of simply ramified covers of the projective line except for a fixed ramification profile above infinity. In particular we draw a connection with the Harris and Mumford stack of admissible covers showing that the boundary of the ELSV compactification appears as a contraction of the boundary of the stack of admissible covers. This lays the needed foundations for a combinatoral interpretation of boundary points of the ELSV compactification
