We show that the standard generating functions for genus 0 two-point twisted Gromov-Witten invariants arising from concavex vector bundles over symplectic toric manifolds are explicit transforms of the corresponding one-point generating functions. The latter are, in turn, transforms of Givental's J-function. We obtain closed formulas for them and, in particular, for two-point Gromov-Witten invariants of non-negative toric complete intersections. Such two-point formulas should play a key role in the computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants (closed, open, and unoriented) of toric complete intersections as they indeed do in the case of the projective complete intersections.
