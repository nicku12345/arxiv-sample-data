We prove formulas for the number of Jordan blocks of the maximal size for local monodromies of one-parameter degenerations of complex algebraic varieties where the bound of the size comes from the monodromy theorem. In case the general fibers are smooth and compact, the proof calculates some part of the weight spectral sequence of the limit mixed Hodge structure of Steenbrink. In the singular case, we can prove a similar formula for the monodromy on the cohomology with compact supports, but not on the usual cohomology. We also show that the number can really depend on the position of singular points in the embedded resolution even in the isolated singularity case, and hence there are no simple combinatorial formulas using the embedded resolution in general.
