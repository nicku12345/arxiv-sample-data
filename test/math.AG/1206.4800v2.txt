Let M(d,\chi) be the moduli space of semistable sheaves of rank 0, Euler characteristic \chi and first Chern class dH (d>0), with H the hyperplane class in \mathbb{P}^2. We give a description of M(d,\chi), viewing each sheaf as a class of matrices with entries in \bigoplus_{i\geq0}H^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(i)). We show that there is a big open subset of M(d,1) isomorphic to a projective bundle over an open subset of a Hilbert scheme of points on \mathbb{P}^2. Finally we compute the classes of M(4,1), M(5,1) and M(5,2) in the Grothendieck group of varieties, especially we conclude that M(5,1) and M(5,2) are of the same class.
