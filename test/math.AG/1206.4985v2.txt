Let X be a rationally connected three-dimensional algebraic variety and let \tau be an element of order two in the group of its birational selfmaps. Suppose that there exists a non-uniruled divisorial component of the \tau-fixed point locus. Using the equivariant minimal model program we give a rough classification of such elements.
