We use the Gromov-Witten/Pairs descendent correspondence for toric 3-folds and degeneration arguments to establish the GW/P correspondence for several compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds (including all CY complete intersections in products of projective spaces). A crucial aspect of the proof is the study of the GW/P correspondence for descendents in relative geometries. Projective bundles over surfaces relative to a section play a special role.   The GW/P correspondence for Calabi-Yau complete intersections provides a structure result for the Gromov-Witten invariants in a fixed curve class. After change of variables, the Gromov-Witten series is a rational function in the variable -q=exp(iu) invariant under q => 1/q.
