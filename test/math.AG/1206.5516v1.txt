We construct five families of two-dimensional moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles (respectively local systems) by taking the equivariant Hilbert scheme of a certain finite group acting on the cotangent bundle of an elliptic curve. We show that the Hilbert scheme of m points of these surfaces is again a moduli space of parabolic Higgs bundles (respectively local systems), confirming a conjecture of Boalch in these cases and extending a result of Gorsky--Nekrasov--Rubtsov. Using the McKay correspondence we establish the autoduality conjecture for the derived categories of the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles under consideration.
