Bring's curve is the genus 4 Riemann surface with automorphism group of maximal size, S_5. Riera and Rodr\'iguez have provided the most detailed study of the curve thus far via a hyperbolic model. We will recover and extend their results via an algebraic model based on a sextic curve given by both Hulek and Craig and implicit in work of Ramanujan. In particular we recover their period matrix; further, the vector of Riemann constants will be identified.
