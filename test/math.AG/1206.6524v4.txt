We prove a comparison formula for curve-counting invariants in the setting of the McKay correspondence, related to the crepant resolution conjecture for Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The conjecture is concerned with comparing the invariants of a (hard Lefschetz) Calabi-Yau orbifold of dimension three with those of a specific crepant resolution of its coarse moduli space. We prove the conjecture for point classes and give a conditional proof for general curve classes. We also prove a variant of the formula for curve classes. Along the way we identify the image of the standard heart of the orbifold under the Bridgeland-King-Reid equivalence.
