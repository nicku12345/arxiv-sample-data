A point P in projective space is said to be Galois with respect to a hypersurface if the function field extension induced by the projection from P is Galois. We present a hyperplane section theorem for Galois points. Precisely, if P is a Galois point for a hypersurface, then P is Galois for a general hyperplane section passing through P. As an application, we determine hypersurfaces of dimension n with n-dimensional sets of Galois points.
