This paper reviews results and techniques from the authors' previous work "Symplectomorphism group relations and degenerations of Landau-Ginzburg models" and applies them in basic examples. The main example is the A_n category where we observe a relationship to stability conditions and directed quiver representations. We conclude with a brief survey of applications to the birational geometry of del Pezzo surfaces.
