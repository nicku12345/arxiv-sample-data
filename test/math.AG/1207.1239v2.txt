The supersingular K3 surface X in characteristic 2 with Artin invariant 1 admits several genus 1 fibrations (elliptic and quasi-elliptic). We use a bijection between fibrations and definite even lattices of rank 20 and discriminant 4 to classify the fibrations, and exhibit isomorphisms between the resulting models of X. We also study a configuration of (-2)-curves on X related to the incidence graph of points and lines of IP^2(IF_4).
