We present an intersection-theoretical approach to the invariants of plane curve singularities \mu, \delta, r related by the Milnor formula 2\delta=\mu+r-1. Using Newton transformations we give formulae for \mu, \delta, r which imply planar versions of well-known theorems on nondegenerate singularities.
