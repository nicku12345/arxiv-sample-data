Let X be a smooth proper variety over the quotient field of a Henselian discrete valuation ring with algebraically closed residue field of characteristic p. We show that for any coherent sheaf E on X, the index of X divides the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic \chi(X,E) if p=0 or p>dim(X)+1. If 0<p\leq dim(X)+1, the prime-to-p part of the index of X divides \chi(X,E). Combining this with the Hattori-Stong theorem yields an analogous result concerning the divisibility of the cobordism class of X by the index of X.   As a corollary, rationally connected varieties over the maximal unramified extension of a p-adic field possess a zero-cycle of p-power degree (a zero-cycle of degree 1 if p>dim(X)+1). When p=0, such statements also have implications for the possible multiplicities of singular fibers in degenerations of complex projective varieties.
