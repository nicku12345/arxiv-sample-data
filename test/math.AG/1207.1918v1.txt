We describe a very large class of conjectural relations in the tautological ring of the moduli space \bar{M}_{g,n} of stable curves of genus g with n marked points, extending and generalizing the Faber-Zagier relations. These notes are loosely based on informal talks given by the author at the workshop at KTH Stockholm on "The moduli space of curves and its intersection theory" in April 2012.
