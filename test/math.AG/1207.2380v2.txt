We obtain lower bounds on the rank of the kappa ring of the Delign-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of curves in different degrees. For this purpose, we introduce a quotient of the kappa ring, the combinatorial kappa ring, and show that the rank of this latter ring in degree d is bounded below by |P(d,3g-2+n-d)| where P(d,r) denotes the set of partitions of the positive integer d into at most r parts. In codimension 1 (i.e. d=3g-4+n) we show that the rank of the kappa ring is equal to n-1 for g=1, and is equal to \lceil \frac{(n+1)(g+1)}{2}\rceil-1 for g>1. Furthermore, in codimension e=3g-3+n-d, the rank of the kappa ring (as g and e remain fixed and n grows large) is asymptotic to \frac{{n+e\choose e}{g+e\choose e}}{(e+1)!}.
