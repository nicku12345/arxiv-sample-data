We give a precise formula for the value of the canonical Green's function at a pair of Weierstrass points on a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. Further we express the 'energy' of the Weierstrass points in terms of a spectral invariant recently introduced by N. Kawazumi and S. Zhang. It follows that the energy is strictly larger than log 2. Our results generalize known formulas for elliptic curves.
