In this paper we study Koszul cohomology and the Green and Prym-Green conjectures for canonical and Prym-canonical binary curves. We prove that if property N_p holds for a canonical or a Prym-canonical binary curve of genus g then it holds for a generic canonical or Prym-canonical binary curve of genus g+1. We also verify the Green and Prym-Green conjectures for generic canonical and Prym-canonical binary curves of low genus (6\leq g\leq 15, g\neq 8 for Prym-canonical and 3\leq g\leq 12 for canonical).
