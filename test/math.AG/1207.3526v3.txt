We construct a new family of minimal surfaces of general type with p_g=q=2 and K^2=6, whose Albanese map is a quadruple cover of an abelian surface with polarization of type (1,3). We also show that this family provides an irreducible component of the moduli space of surfaces with p_g=q=2 and K^2=6. Finally, we prove that such a component is generically smooth of dimension 4 and that it contains the 2-dimensional family of product-quotient examples previously constructed by the first author. The main tools we use are the Fourier-Mukai transform and the Schr\"odinger representation of the finite Heisenberg group \mathscr{H}_3.
