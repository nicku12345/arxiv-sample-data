We give a new, geometric proof of the section conjecture for fixed points of finite group actions on projective curves of positive genus defined over the field of complex numbers, as well as its natural nilpotent analogue. As a part of our investigations we give an explicit description of the abelianised section map for groups of prime order in this setting. We also show a version of the 2-nilpotent section conjecture.
