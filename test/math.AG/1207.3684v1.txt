In this paper we define tensor modules(sheaves) of Schur type,or of generalized Schur type associated with the give module(sheaf), using the so-called Schur functors. Then using global method we construct canonical homomorphisms between these modules(sheaves). We will get canonical isomorphisms if the original sheaf is locally free using idea of algebraic geometry, which is in fact a generalization of result in linear algebra. In the final section, we give canonical complexes using homomorphisms constructed before, and these complexes will become split exact sequence if further condition holds. And we could use local method to give concrete descriptions of these canonical homomorphisms.
