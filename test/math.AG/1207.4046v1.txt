The Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture predicts that the actions of the automorphism group on the effective nef cone and the pseudo-automorphism group on the effective movable cone of a klt Calabi-Yau pair (X, \Delta) have finite, rational polyhedral fundamental domains. Let Z be an n-dimensional Fano manifold of index n-1 such that -K_Z = (n-1) H for an ample divisor H. Let \Gamma be the base locus of a general (n-1)-dimensional linear system V \subset |H|. In this paper, we verify the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture for the blow-up of Z along \Gamma.
