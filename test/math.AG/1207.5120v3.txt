Let C be a smooth projective curve of genus g\geq 2 over \mathbb C. Fix n\geq 1, d\in {\mathbb Z}. A pair (E,\phi) over C consists of an algebraic vector bundle E of rank n and degree d over C and a section \phi \in H^0(E). There is a concept of stability for pairs which depends on a real parameter \tau. Let {\mathfrak M}_\tau(n,d) be the moduli space of \tau-polystable pairs of rank n and degree d over C. Here we prove that for a generic curve C, the moduli space {\mathfrak M}_\tau(n,d) satisfies the Hodge Conjecture for n \leq 4. For obtaining this, we prove first that {\mathfrak M}_\tau(n,d) is motivated by C.
