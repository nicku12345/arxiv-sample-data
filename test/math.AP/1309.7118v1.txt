This paper is concerned with a nonlinear integral equation  (P)\qquad u(x,t)=\int_{{\bf R}^N}G(x-y,t)\varphi(y)dy+\int_0^t\int_{{\bf R}^N}G(x-y,t-s)f(y,s:u)dyds, \quad  where N\ge 1, \varphi\in L^\infty({\bf R}^N)\cap L^1({\bf R}^N,(1+|x|^K)dx) for some K\ge 0. Here G=G(x,t) is a generalization of the heat kernel. We are interested in the asymptotic expansions of the solution of (P) behaving like a multiple of the integral kernel G as t\to\infty.
