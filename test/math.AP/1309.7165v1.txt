A by now classical result due to DiBenedetto states that the spatial gradient of solutions to the parabolic p-Laplacian system is locally H\"older continuous in the interior. However, the boundary regularity is not yet well understood. In this paper we prove a boundary L^\infty-estimate for the spatial gradient Du of solutions to the parabolic p-Laplacian system \begin{equation*} \partial_t u - \Div \big(|Du|^{p-2}Du\big) = 0 \quad\mbox{in \Omega\times(0,T)} \end{equation*} for p\ge 2, together with a quantitative estimate. In particular, this implies the global Lipschitz regularity of solutions. The result continues to hold for the so called asymptotically regular parabolic systems.
