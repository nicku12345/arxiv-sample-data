We establish the global well-posedness of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in \mathbb R^n for any initial data {\bf m}_0\in H^1_*(\mathbb R^n,\mathbb S^2) whose gradient belongs to the Morrey space M^{2,2}(\mathbb R^n) with small norm \displaystyle\|\nabla {\bf m}_0\|_{M^{2,2}(\mathbb R^n)}. The method is based on priori estimates of a dissipative Schr\"odinger equation of Ginzburg-Landau types obtained from the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation by the moving frame technique.
