Applying the method of moving planes in integral forms, we establish radial symmetry for positive solutions to a class of semilinear equations involving the fractional Laplacian in the unit ball and obtain Liouville type theorems concerning the non-existence of positive solutions in the half space. The regularity of solutions are also investigated.
