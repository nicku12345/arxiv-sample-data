For n\ge 1 and \alpha\in (-1,1), let H^{\alpha,2} be the space of harmonic functions u on the upper half space \mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+ satisfying \displaystyle\sup_{(x_0,r)\in \mathbb R^{n+1}_+}r^{-(2\alpha+n)}\int_{B(x_0,r)}\int_0^r|\nabla_{x,t} u(x,t)|^2t\,dt\,dx<\infty, and \mathcal{L}_{2,n+2\alpha} be the Campanato space on \mathbb R^n. We show that H^{\alpha,2} coincide with e^{-t\sqrt{-\Delta}}\mathcal{L}_{2,n+2\alpha} for all \alpha\in (-1,1), where the case \alpha\in [0,1) was originally discovered by Fabes, Johnson and Neri [Indiana Univ. Math. J. 25 (1976), 159-170] and yet the case \alpha\in (-1,0) was left open. Moreover, for the scaling invariant version of H^{\alpha,2}, \mathcal{H}^{\alpha,2}, which comprises all harmonic functions u on \mathbb R^{n+1}_+ satisfying \sup_{(x_0,r)\in\mathbb R^{n+1}_+}r^{-(2\alpha+n)}\int_{B(x_0,r)} \int_0^r|\nabla_{x,t} u(x,t)|^2\,t^{1+2\alpha} \,dt\,dx<\infty, we show that \mathcal{H}^{\alpha,2}=e^{-t\sqrt{-\Delta}}(-\Delta)^\frac{\alpha}{2}\mathcal{L}_{2,n+2\alpha}, where (-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\mathcal{L}_{2,n+2\alpha} is the collection of all functions f such that (-\Delta)^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}f are in \mathcal{L}_{2,n+2\alpha}. Analogues for solutions to the heat equation are also established. As an application, we show that the spaces \big((-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\mathcal{L}_{2,n+2\alpha}\big)^{-1} unify Q_{\alpha}^{-1}, {\mathrm{BMO}}^{-1} and \dot{B}^{-1,\infty}_\infty naturally.
