We study the generalized boundary value problem for (E)\; -\Delta u+|u|^{q-1}u=0 in a dihedral domain \Gw, when q>1 is supercritical. The value of the critical exponent can take only a finite number of values depending on the geometry of \Gw. When \gm is a bounded Borel measure in a k-wedge, we give necessary and sufficient conditions in order it be the boundary value of a solution of (E). We also give conditions which ensure that a boundary compact subset is removable. These conditions are expressed in terms of Bessel capacities B_{s,q'} in \BBR^{N-k} where s depends on the characteristics of the wedge. This allows us to describe the boundary trace of a positive solution of (E)
