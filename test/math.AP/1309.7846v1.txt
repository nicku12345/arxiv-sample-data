We look for solutions to generic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations build upon solitons and kinks. Solitons are localized solitary waves and kinks are their non localized counter-parts. We prove the existence of infinite soliton trains, i.e. solutions behaving at large time as the sum of infinitely many solitons. We also show that one can attach a kink at one end of the train. Our proofs proceed by fixed point arguments around the desired profile. We present two approaches leading to different results, one based on a combination of dispersive estimates and Strichartz estimates, the other based only on Strichartz estimates.
