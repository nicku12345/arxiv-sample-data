We study the reconstruction of the attenuation and absorption coefficients in a stationary linear transport equation from knowledge of albedo operator in dimension n\geq 3 on a Riemannian manifold in the presence of a magnetic field. We show the direct boundary value problem is well posed under two types of subcritical conditions. We obtain uniqueness and non-uniqueness results of the reconstruction under some restrictions. Finally, stability estimates are also established.
