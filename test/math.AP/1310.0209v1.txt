We prove sharp estimates for the decay in time of solutions to a rather general class of non-local in time subdiffusion equations on a bounded domain subject to a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Important special cases are the time-fractional and ultraslow diffusion equation, which have seen much interest during the last years, mostly due to their applications in the modeling of anomalous diffusion. We study the case where the equation is in divergence form with bounded measurable coefficients. Our proofs rely on energy estimates and make use of a new and powerful inequality for integro-differential operators of the form \partial_t (k\ast \cdot). The results can be generalized to certain quasilinear equations. We illustrate this by looking at the time-fractional p-Laplace and porous medium equation. Here it turns out that the decay behaviour is markedly different from that in the classical parabolic case.
