We prove a weak stability result for the three-dimensional homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system. More precisely, we investigate the following problem : if a sequence (u_{0, n})_{n\in \N} of initial data, bounded in some scaling invariant space, converges weakly to an initial data u_0 which generates a global regular solution, does u_{0, n} generate a global regular solution ? A positive answer in general to this question would imply global regularity for any data, through the following examples u_{0,n} = n \vf_0(n\cdot) or u_{0,n} = \vf_0(\cdot-x_n) with |x_n|\to \infty. We therefore introduce a new concept of weak convergence (rescaled weak convergence) under which we are able to give a positive answer. The proof relies on profile decompositions in anisotropic spaces and their propagation by the Navier-Stokes equations.
