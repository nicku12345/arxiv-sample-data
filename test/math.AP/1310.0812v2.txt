The p-Laplace equation    \n \cdot (|\n u|^n \n u)=0 \whereA n>0,  in a bounded domain \O \subset \re^2, with inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions on the smooth boundary \p \O is considered. In addition, there is a finite collection of curves   \Gamma = \Gamma_1\cup...\cup\Gamma_m \subset \O, \quad \{on which we assume homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions} \quad u=0,  modeling a multiple crack formation, focusing at the origin 0 \in \O. This makes the above quasilinear elliptic problem overdetermined. Possible types of the behaviour of solution u(x,y) at the tip 0 of such admissible multiple cracks, being a "singularity" point, are described, on the basis of blow-up scaling techniques and a "nonlinear eigenvalue problem". Typical types of admissible cracks are shown to be governed by nodal sets of a countable family of nonlinear eigenfunctions, which are obtained via branching from harmonic polynomials that occur for n=0. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, saddle-node bifurcations in n are shown to occur for those nonlinear eigenvalues/eigenfunctions.
