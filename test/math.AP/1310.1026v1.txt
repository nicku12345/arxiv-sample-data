We study standing wave solutions to nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations, on a manifold with a rotational symmetry, which transform in a natural fashion under the group of rotations. We call these vortex solutions. They are higher dimensional versions of vortex standing waves that have been studied on the Euclidean plane. We focus on two types of vortex solutions, which we call spherical vortices and axial vortices.
