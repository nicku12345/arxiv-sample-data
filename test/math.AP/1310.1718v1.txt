We consider the following system linearly coupled by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in \R^3  \left\{\begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u_j+u_j=u^3_j-\va\sum\limits_{i\neq j}^N u_i,\{1cm}& x\in \R^3, \{0.2cm}\\ u_j\in H^1(\R^3),\quad j=1,\cdots,N, \end{array} \right.  where \va\in\R is a coupling constant. This type of system arises in particular in models in nonlinear N-core fiber.   We examine the effect of the linear coupling to the solution structure. When N=2,3, for any prescribed integer \ell\ge 2, we construct a non-radial vector solutions of segregated type, with two components having exactly \ell positive bumps for \va>0 sufficiently small. We also give an explicit description on the characteristic features of the vector solutions.
