We consider a class of non-quasiconvex frame indifferent energy densities which includes Ogden-type energy densities for nematic elastomers. For the corresponding geometrically linear problem we provide an explicit minimizer of the energy functional satisfying a nontrivial boundary condition. Other attainment results, both for the nonlinear and the linearized model, are obtained by using the theory of convex integration introduced by M\"uller and Sver\'ak in the context of crystalline solids.
