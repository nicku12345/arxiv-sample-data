We study the Cauchy problem for the (generalized) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \begin{align} u_t+(-\Delta)^{\alpha}u+u\cdot \nabla u +\nabla p=0, \ \ {\rm div} u=0, \ \ u(0,x)= u_0. \nonumber \end{align} We show the analyticity of the local solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation (\alpha=1) with any initial data in critical Besov spaces \dot{B}^{n/p-1}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n) with 1< p<\infty, \ 1\le q\le \infty  and the solution is global if u_0 is sufficiently small in \dot{B}^{n/p-1}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n). In the case p=\infty, the analyticity for the local solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation (\alpha=1) with any initial data in modulation space M^{-1}_{\infty,1}(\mathbb{R}^n) is obtained. We prove the global well-posedness for a fractional Navier-stokes equation (\alpha=1/2) with small data in critical Besov spaces \dot{B}^{n/p}_{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n) \ (1\leq p\leq\infty) and show the analyticity of solutions with small initial data either in \dot{B}^{n/p}_{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^n) \ (1\leq p<\infty) or in \dot{B}^0_{\infty,1} (\mathbb{R}^n)\cap {M}^0_{\infty,1}(\mathbb{R}^n). Similar results also hold for all \alpha\in (1/2,1).
