We study the Schr\"{o}dinger equation: \begin{equation} - \Delta u+V(x)u=f(x,u) ,\qquad u\in H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{N}),\nonumber \end{equation} where V is periodic and f is periodic in the x-variables, 0 is in a gap of the spectrum of the operator -\Delta+V and f is asymptotically linear as |u|\rightarrow+\infty. We prove that under some asymptotically linear assumptions for f, this equation has a nontrivial solution. Our assumptions for f are different from the classical assumptions raised by G. B. Li and A. Szulkin in
