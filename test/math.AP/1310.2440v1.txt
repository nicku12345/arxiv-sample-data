Motivated by experimental observations on CuAlNi single crystals, we present a theoretical investigation of non-planar austenite-martensite interfaces. Our analysis is based on the nonlinear elasticity model for martensitic transformations and we show that, under suitable assumptions on the lattice parameters, non-planar interfaces are possible, in particular for transitions with cubic austenite.
