This paper is devoted to the analysis of multiphase shape optimization problems, which can formally be written as \min\Big\{{g}(F_1(\Omega_1),\dots,F_h(\Omega_h))+ m\vert\,\bigcup_{i=1}^h\Omega_i\vert :\ \Omega_i\subset D,\ \Omega_i\cap \Omega_j =\emptyset\Big\}, where D\subset\mathcal{R}^d is a given bounded open set, \vert\Omega_i\vert is the Lebesgue measure of \Omega_i and m is a positive constant. For a large class of such functionals, we analyse qualitative properties of the cells \Omega_i and the interaction between them. Each cell is itself subsolution for a (single phase) shape optimization problem, from which we deduce properties like finite perimeter, inner density, separation by open sets, absence of triple junction points, etc.   As main examples we consider functionals involving the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian of each cell, i.e. F_i=\lambda_{k_i}.
