In space dimension n\geq3, we consider the electromagnetic Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian H=(\nabla-iA(x))^2+V and the corresponding Helmholtz equation   (\nabla-iA(x))^2u+u+V(x)u=f\quad \text{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^n, where the magnetic and electric potentials are allowed to have singularities at the origin and decay at infinity. We extend the well known L^p-L^q estimates for the solution of the free Helmholtz equation to the case when the electromagnetic hamiltonian H is considered. This work extends the results that appear in \cite{G}.
