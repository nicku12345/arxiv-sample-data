The unique global strong solution in the Chemin-Lerner type space to the Cauchy problem on the Boltzmann equation for hard potentials is constructed in perturbation framework. Such solution space is of critical regularity with respect to spatial variable, and it can capture the intrinsic property of the Botlzmann equation. For the proof of global well-posedness, we develop some new estimates on the nonlinear collision term through the Littlewood-Paley theory.
