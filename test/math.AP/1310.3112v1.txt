We formulate a new criterion for regularity of a suitable weak solution v to the Navier-Stokes equations at the space-time point (x_0,t_0). The criterion imposes a Serrin-type integrability condition on v only in a backward neighbourhood of (x_0,t_0), intersected with the exterior of a certain space-time paraboloid with vertex at point (x_0,t_0). We make no special assumptions on the solution in the interior of the paraboloid.
