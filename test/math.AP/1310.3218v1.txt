We obtain a priori estimates with best constants for the solutions of the fractional fast diffusion equation u_t+(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}u^m=0, posed in the whole space with 0<\sigma<2, 0<m\le 1. The estimates are expressed in terms of convenient norms of the initial data, the preferred norms being the L^1-norm and the Marcinkiewicz norm. The estimates contain exact exponents and best constants. We also obtain optimal estimates for the extinction time of the solutions in the range m near 0 where solutions may vanish completely in finite time. Actually, our results apply to equations with a more general nonlinearity. Our main tools are symmetrization techniques and comparison of concentrations. Classical results for \sigma=2 are recovered in the limit.
