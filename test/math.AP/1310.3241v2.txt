We consider a class of wave-Schroedinger systems with a Zakharov-Schulman type coupling. This class of systems is indexed by a parameter gamma which measures the strength of the null form in the nonlinearity of the wave equation. The case gamma = 1 corresponds to the well-known Zakharov system, while the case gamma = -1 corresponds to the Yukawa system. Here we show that sufficiently smooth and localized Cauchy data lead to pointwise decaying global solutions which scatter, for any gamma in (0,1].
