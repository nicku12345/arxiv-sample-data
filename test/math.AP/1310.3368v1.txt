In this paper, we will show the blow-up of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem for the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations and isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with constant and degenerate viscosities in arbitrary dimensions under some restrictions on the initial data. In particular, the results hold true for the full compressible Euler equations and isentropic compressible Euler equations and the blow-up time can be computed in a more precise way. It is not required that the initial data has compact support or contain vacuum in any finite regions. Moreover, a simplified and unified proof on the blow-up results to the classical solutions of the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations without heat conduction by Xin \cite{Xin} and with heat conduction by Cho-Bin \cite{CJ} will be given.
