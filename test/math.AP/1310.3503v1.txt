The solution of the Chern-Simons-Higgs model in Lorenz gauge with data for the potential in H^{s-1/2} and for the Higgs field in H^s \times H^{s-1} is shown to be unique in the natural space C([0,T];H^{s-1/2} \times H^s \times H^{s-1}) for s \ge 1, where s=1 corresponds to finite energy. Huh and Oh recently proved local well-posedness for s > 3/4, but uniqueness was obtained only in a proper subspace Y^s of Bourgain type. We prove that any solution in C([0,T];H^{1/2} \times H^1 \times L^2) must in fact belong to the space Y^{3/4+\epsilon}, hence it is the unique solution obtained by Huh and Oh.
