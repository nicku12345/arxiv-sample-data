This paper studies a possible connection between the way the time averaged electromagnetic power dissipated into heat blows up and the anomalous localized resonance in plasmonic structures. We show that there is a setting in which the localized resonance takes place whenever the resonance does and moreover, the power is always bounded and might go to 0. We also provide another setting in which the resonance is complete and the power goes to infinity whenever resonance occurs; as a consequence of this fact there is no localized resonance. This work is motivated from recent works on cloaking via anomalous localized resonance.
