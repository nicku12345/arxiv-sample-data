Consider a bilinear interaction between two linear dispersive waves with a generic resonant structure (roughly speaking, space and time resonant sets intersect transversally). We derive an asymptotic equivalent of the solution for data in the Schwartz class, and bilinear dispersive estimates for data in weighted Lebesgue spaces. An application to water waves with infinite depth, gravity and surface tension is also presented.
