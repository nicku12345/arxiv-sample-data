We establish local higher integrability and differentiability results for minimizers of variational integrals  \mathfrak{F}(v,\Omega) = \int_{\Omega} /! F(Dv(x)) \, dx  over W^{1,p}--Sobolev mappings u \colon \Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^n \to {\mathbb R}^N satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition. The integrands F are assumed to be autonomous, convex and of (p,q) growth, but are otherwise not subjected to any further structure conditions, and we consider exponents in the range 1<p \leq q < p^{\ast}, where p^{\ast} denotes the Sobolev conjugate exponent of p.
