In this paper we study a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model for the approximation of large scales of the 3D Boussinesq equations. This model is obtained using the approach first described by Stolz and Adams, based on the Van Cittern approximate deconvolution operators, and applied to the filtered Boussinesq equations. Existence and uniqueness of a regular weak solution are provided. Our main objective is to prove that this solution converges towards a solution of the filtered Boussinesq equations, as the deconvolution parameter goes to zero.
