Given (M,g) a smooth compact Riemannian manifold without boundary of dimension n\geq 3, we consider the first conformal eigenvalue which is by definition the supremum of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian among all metrics conformal to g of volume 1. We prove that it is always greater than n\omega_n^{\frac{2}{n}}, the value it takes in the conformal class of the round sphere, except if (M,g) is conformally diffeomorphic to the standard sphere.
