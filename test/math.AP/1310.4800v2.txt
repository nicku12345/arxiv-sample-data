In this paper, we study the critical Sobolev embeddings W^{1,p(x)}(\Omega)\subset L^{p^*(x)}(\Omega) for variable exponent Sobolev spaces from the point of view of the \Gamma-convergence. More precisely we determine the \Gamma-limit of subcritical approximation of the best constant associated with this embedding. As an application we provide a sufficient condition for the existence of extremals for the best constant.
