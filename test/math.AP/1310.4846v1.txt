In this note we review some results on the transversality conditions for a smooth Fredholm map f: X \times (0,T) \to Y between two Banach spaces X,Y. These conditions are well-known in the realm of bifurcation theory and commonly accepted as "generic". Here we show that under the transversality assumptions the sections C(t)=\{x:f(x,t)=0\} of the zero set of f are discrete for every t\in (0,T) and we discuss a somehow explicit family of perturbations of f along which transversality holds up to a residual set.   The application of these results to the case when f is the X-differential of a time-dependent energy functional E:X\times (0,T)\to R and C(t) is the set of the critical points of E provides the motivation and the main example of this paper.
