A nested family of growing or shrinking planar domains is called a Laplacian growth process if the normal velocity of each domain's boundary is proportional to the gradient of the domain's Green function with a fixed singularity on the interior. In this paper we review the Laplacian growth model and its key underlying assumptions, so that we may consider a generalization to so-called elliptic growth, wherein the Green function is replaced with that of a more general elliptic operator--this models, for example, inhomogeneities in the underlying plane. In this paper we continue the development of the underlying mathematics for elliptic growth, considering perturbations of the Green function due to those of the driving operator, deriving characterizations and examples of growth, developing a weak formulation of growth via balayage, and discussing of a couple of inverse problems in the spirit of Calder\'on. We conclude with a derivation of a more delicate, reregularized model for Hele-Shaw flow.
