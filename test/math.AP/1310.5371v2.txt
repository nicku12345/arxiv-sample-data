We study growth lemmas and questions of regularity for generators of Markov processes. The generators are allowed to have an arbitrary order of differentiability less than 2. In general, this order is represented by a function and not by a number. The approach enables a careful study of regularity issues up to the phase boundary between integro-differential (positive order of differentiability) and integral operators (nonnegative order of differentiability). The proof is based on intrinsic scaling properties of the underlying operators and stochastic processes.
