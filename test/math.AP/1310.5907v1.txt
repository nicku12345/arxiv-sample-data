We develop arguments on convexity and minimization of energy functionals on Orlicz-Sobolev spaces to investigate existence of solution to the equation \displaystyle -\mbox{div} (\phi(|\nabla u|) \nabla u) = f(x,u) + h \mbox{in} \Omega under Dirichlet boundary conditions, where \Omega \subset {\bf R}^{N} is a bounded smooth domain, \phi : (0,\infty)\longrightarrow (0,\infty) is a suitable continuous function and f: \Omega \times {\bf R} \to {\bf R} satisfies the Carath\'eodory conditions, while h is a measure.
