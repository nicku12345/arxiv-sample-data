We develop arguments on the critical point theory for locally Lipschitz functionals on Orlicz-Sobolev spaces, along with convexity and compactness techniques to investigate existence of solution of the multivalued equation \displaystyle - \Delta_{\Phi} u \in \partial j(.,u) + \lambda h \mbox{in} \Omega, where \Omega \subset {\bf R}^{N} is a bounded smooth domain, \Phi : {\r} \longrightarrow [0,\infty) is a suitable N-function, \Delta_{\Phi} is the corresponding \Phi-Laplacian, \lambda > 0 is a parameter, h:\Omega\rightarrow{\r} is integrable and \partial j(., u) is the subdifferential of a function j associated with critical growth.
