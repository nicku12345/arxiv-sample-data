Consider the system |\partial_tu+\Delta u|\leq M(|u|+|\nabla u|), |u(x,t)|\leq Me^{M|x|^2} in \mathcal{C}_{\theta}\times[0,T] and u(x,0)=0 in \mathcal{C}_{\theta}, where \mathcal{C}_{\theta} is a cone with opening angle \theta. L. Escauriaza constructed an example to show that such system has a nonzero bounded solution when \theta<90^\circ, and it's conjectured that the system has only zero solution for \theta>90^\circ. Recently Lu Li and V. \v{S}ver\'{a}k \cite{LlS} proved that the claim is true for \theta>109.5^\circ. Here we improve their result and prove that only zero solution exists for this system when \theta>99^\circ by exploring a new type of Carleman inequality, which is of independent interest.
