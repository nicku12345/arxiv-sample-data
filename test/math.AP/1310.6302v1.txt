We investigate L^1(\mathbb R^4)\to L^\infty(\mathbb R^4) dispersive estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator H=-\Delta+V when there are obstructions, a resonance or an eigenvalue, at zero energy. In particular, we show that if there is a resonance or an eigenvalue at zero energy then there is a time dependent, finite rank operator F_t satisfying \|F_t\|_{L^1\to L^\infty} \lesssim 1/\log t for t>2 such that \|e^{itH}P_{ac}-F_t\|_{L^1\to L^\infty} \lesssim t^{-1},\,\,\,\,\,\text{for} t>2. We also show that the operator F_t=0 if there is an eigenvalue but no resonance at zero energy. We then develop analogous dispersive estimates for the solution operator to the four dimensional wave equation with potential.
