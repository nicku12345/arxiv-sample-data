Given an initial data v_0 with vorticity \Om_0=\na\times v_0 in L^{\frac 3 2}, (which implies that v_0 belongs to the Sobolev space H^{\frac12}), we prove that the solution v given by the classical Fujita-Kato theorem blows up in a finite time T^\star only if, for any p in  ]4,6[ and any unit vector e in \R^3, there holds  \int_0^{T^\star}\|v(t)\cdot e\|_{\dH^{\f12+\f2p}}^p\,dt=\infty. We remark that all these quantities are scaling invariant under the scaling transformation of Navier-Stokes system.
