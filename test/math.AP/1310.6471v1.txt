We establish a Liouville type result for a backward global solution to the Navier-Stokes equations in the half plane with the no-slip boundary condition. No assumptions on spatial decay for the vorticity nor the velocity field are imposed. We study the vorticity equations instead of the original Navier-Stokes equations. As an application, we extend the geometric regularity criterion for the Navier-Stokes equations in the three-dimensional half space under the no-slip boundary condition.
