In this article we deal with the backward uniqueness property of the heat equation in conical domains in two spatial dimensions via Carleman inequality techniques. Using a microlocal interpretation of the pseudoconvexity condition, we improve the bounds of \v{S}ver\'ak and Li on the minimal angle in which the backward uniqueness property is displayed: We reach angles of slightly less than 95^{\circ}. Via two-dimensional limiting Carleman weights we obtain the uniqueness of possible controls of the heat equation with lower order perturbations in conical domains with opening angles larger than 90^{\circ}
