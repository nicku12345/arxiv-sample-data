We are interested in the differential equation \ddot u(t) = -A u(t) - c A \dot u(t) + \lambda u(t) + F(t,u(t)), where c > 0 is a damping factor, A is a sectorial operator and F is a continuous map. We consider the situation where the equation is at resonance at infinity, which means that \lambda is an eigenvalue of A and F is a bounded map. We introduce new geometrical conditions for the nonlinearity F and use topological degree methods to find T-periodic solutions for this equation as fixed points of Poincar\'e operator.
