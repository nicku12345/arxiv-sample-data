Two reconstruction methods of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) are numerically compared for nonsmooth conductivities in the plane based on the use of complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions to D-bar equations involving the global uniqueness proofs for Calder\'on problem exposed in [Nachman; Annals of Mathematics 143, 1996] and [Astala and P\"aiv\"arinta; Annals of Mathematics 163, 2006]: the Astala-P\"aiv\"arinta theory-based "low-pass transport matrix method" implemented in [Astala et al.; Inverse Problems and Imaging 5, 2011] and the "shortcut method" which considers ingredients of both theories. The latter method is formally similar to the Nachman theory-based regularized EIT reconstruction algorithm studied in [Knudsen, Lassas, Mueller and Siltanen; Inverse Problems and Imaging 3, 2009] and several references from there.   New numerical results are presented using parallel computation with size parameters larger than ever, leading mainly to two conclusions as follows. First, both methods can approximate piecewise constant conductivities better and better as the cutoff frequency increases, and there seems to be a Gibbs-like phenomenon producing ringing artifacts. Second, the transport matrix method loses accuracy away from a (freely chosen) pivot point located outside of the object to be studied, whereas the shortcut method produces reconstructions with more uniform quality.
