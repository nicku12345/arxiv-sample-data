We address an important issue of a dynamic homogenisation in vector elasticity for a doubly periodic mass-spring elastic lattice. The notion of logarithmically growing resonant waves is used in a complete analysis of star-shaped wave forms induced by an oscillating point force. We note that the dispersion surfaces for Floquet-Bloch waves in an elastic lattice main contain critical points of the saddle type. Based on the local quadratic approximations of the frequency, as a function of wave vector components, we deduce properties of a transient asymptotic solution as the contribution of the point source to the wave form. In this way, we describe local Green's functions as localized wave forms corresponding to the resonant frequency. The peculiarity of the problem lies in the fact that, at the same resonant frequency, the Taylor quadratic approximations for different groups of the resonant points are different, and hence we deal with different local Green's functions. Thus, there is no uniformly defined homogenisation procedure for a given resonant frequency. Instead, the continuous approximation of the wave field can be obtained through the asymptotic analysis of the lattice Green's functions.
