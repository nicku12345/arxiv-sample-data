Basing on our results [1] on a representation of solutions to the Cauchy problem for multidimensional non-viscous Burgers equation obtained by a method of stochastic perturbation of the associated Langevin system, we deduce an explicit asymptotic formula for smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem for any genuinely nonlinear hyperbolic system of equations written in the Riemann invariants.
