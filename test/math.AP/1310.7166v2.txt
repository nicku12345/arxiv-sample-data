In this paper, we prove that there exists some small \varepsilon_*>0, such that the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (DNLS) is global well-posedness in the energy space, provided that the initial data u_0\in H^1(\mathbb{R}) satisfies \|u_0\|_{L^2}<\sqrt{2\pi}+\varepsilon_*. This result shows us that there are no blow up solutions whose masses slightly exceed 2\pi, even if their energies are negative. This phenomenon is much different from the behavior of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with critical nonlinearity. The technique is a variational argument together with the momentum conservation law. Further, for the DNLS on half-line \mathbb{R}^+, we show the blow-up for the solution with negative energy.
