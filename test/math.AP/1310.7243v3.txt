In this paper, we give positive answer to the open question raised in [E. Zuazua, Exponential decay for the semilinear wave equation with localized damping in unbounded domains. J. Math. Pures Appl., 70 (1991) 513--529] on the exponential decay of solutions for the semilinear plate equation with localized damping.
