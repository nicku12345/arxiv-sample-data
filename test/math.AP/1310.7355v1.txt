We consider a system of differential equations with nonlinear Steklov boundary conditions, related to the fractional problem (-\Delta)^s u_i = f_i(x,u_i) - \beta u_i^p \sum_{j\neq i} a_{ij} u_j^p, where i = i,\dots, k, s\in(0,1), p>0, a_{ij}>0 and \beta>0. When k=2 we develop a quasi-optimal regularity theory in C^{0,\alpha}, uniformly w.r.t. \beta, for every \alpha < \alpha_{\mathrm opt}=min(1,2s); moreover we show that the traces of the limiting profiles as \beta\to+\infty are Lipschitz continuous and segregated. Such results are extended to the case of k\geq3 densities, with some restrictions on s, p and a_{ij}.
