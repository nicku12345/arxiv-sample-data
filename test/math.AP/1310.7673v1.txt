This paper provides the phase transition analysis of a reaction diffusion equations system modeling dynamic instability of microtubules. For this purpose we have generalized the macroscopic model studied by Mour\~ao et all [MSS]. This model investigates the interaction between the microtubule nucleation, essential dynamics parameters and extinction and their impact on the stability of the system. The considered framework encompasses a system of partial differential equations for the elongation and shortening of microtubules, where the rates of elongation as well as the lifetimes of the elongating shortening phases are linear functions of GTP-tubulin concentration. In a novel way, this paper investigates the stability analysis and provides a bifurcation analysis for the dynamic instability of microtubules in the presence of diffusion and all of the fundamental dynamics parameters. Our stability analysis introduces the phase transition method as a new mathematical tool in the study of microtubule dynamics. The mathematical tools introduced to handle the problem should be of general use.
