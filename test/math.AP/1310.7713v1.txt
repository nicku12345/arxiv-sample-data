We consider the Ostrovsky equation, which contains nonlinear dispersive effects. We prove that as the diffusion parameter tend to zero, the solutions of the dispersive equation converge to discontinuous weak solutions of the Ostrovsky-Hunter equation. The proof relies on deriving suitable a priori estimates together with an application of the compensated compactness method in the L^p setting.
