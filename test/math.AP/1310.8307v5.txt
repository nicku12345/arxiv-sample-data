We study the regularity of a distributional solution (u,p) of the 3D incompressible evolution Navier-Stokes equations. Let B_r denote concentric balls in \mathbb{R}^3 with radius r. We will show that if p\in L^{m} (0,1; L^1(B_2)), m>2, and if u is sufficiently small in L^{\infty} (0,1; L^{3,\infty}(B_2)), without any assumption on its gradient, then u is bounded in B_1\times (\frac{1}{10},1). It is an endpoint case of the usual Serrin-type regularity criteria, and extends the steady-state result of Kim-Kozono to the time dependent setting. In the appendix we also show some nonendpoint borderline regularity criteria.
