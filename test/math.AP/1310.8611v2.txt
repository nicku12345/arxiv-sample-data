In this note we study locally self-similar blow up for the Euler equation. The main result states that under a mild L^p-growth assumption on the profile v, namely, \int_{|y| \sim L} |v|^p dy \lesssim L^{\g} for some \g <p-2, the self-similar solution carries a positive amount of energy up to the time of blow-up T, namely, \int_{|y| \sim L} |v|^2 dy \sim L^{N-2\a}. The result implies and extends several previously known exclusion criteria. It also supports a general conjecture relating fractal local dimensions of the energy measure with the rate of velocity growth at the time of possible blowup.
