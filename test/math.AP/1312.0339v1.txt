For A\in M^{2\times 2} let S(A)=\sqrt{A^T A}, i.e. the symmetric part of the polar decomposition of A. We consider the relation between two quasiregular mappings whose symmetric part of gradient are close. Our main result is the following. Suppose v,u\in W^{1,2}(B_1(0):\mathbb{R}^2) are Q-quasiregular mappings with \int_{B_1(0)} \det(Du)^{-p} dz\leq C_p for some p\in (0,1) and \int_{B_1(0)} |Du|^2 dz\leq 1. There exists constant M>1 such that if  \int_{B_1(0)} |S(Du)-S(Dv)|^2 dz=\epsilon  then  \int_{B_{\frac{1}{2}}(0)} |Dv-R Du| dz\leq c C_p^{\frac{1}{p}}\epsilon^{\frac{p^3}{M Q^5\log(10 C_p Q)}}\text{ for some }R\in SO(2).    Taking u=Id we obtain a special case of the quantitative rigidity result of Friesecke, James and Muller. Our main result can be considered as a first step in a new line of generalization of F-J-M Theorem in which Id is replaced by a mapping of non-trivial degree.
