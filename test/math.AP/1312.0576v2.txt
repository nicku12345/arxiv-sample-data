Based on a variant of frequency function, we improve the vanishing order of solutions for Schr\"{o}dinger equations which describes quantitative behavior of strong uniqueness continuation property. For the first time, we investigate the quantitative uniqueness of higher order elliptic equations and show the vanishing order of solutions. Furthermore, strong unique continuation is established for higher order elliptic equations using this variant of frequency function.
