We study a one dimensional metastable dynamics of internal interfaces for the initial boundary value problem for the following convection-reaction-diffusion equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u = \varepsilon \partial_x^2 u -\partial_x f(u)+ f'(u). \end{equation*} A metastable behavior appears when the time-dependent solution develops into a layered function in a relatively short time, and subsequent approaches its steady state in a very long time interval. A rigorous analysis is used to study such behavior, by means of the construction of a one-parameter family \{ U^\varepsilon(x;\xi)\}_\xi of approximate stationary solutions and of a linearization of the original system around an element of this family. We obtain a system consisting in an ODE for the parameter \xi, describing the position of the interface, coupled with a PDE for the perturbation v, defined as the difference v:=u-U^\varepsilon. The key of our analysis are the spectral properties of the linearized operator around an element of the family \{ U^\varepsilon \}: the presence of a first eigenvalue, small with respect to \varepsilon, leads to a metastable behavior when \varepsilon \ll 1.
