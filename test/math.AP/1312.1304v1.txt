In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of a Boltzmann type price formation model, which describes the trading dynamics in a financial market. In many of these markets trading happens at high frequencies and low transactions costs. This observation motivates the study of the limit as the number of transactions k tends to infinity, the transaction cost a to zero and ka=const. Furthermore we illustrate the price dynamics with numerical simulations.
