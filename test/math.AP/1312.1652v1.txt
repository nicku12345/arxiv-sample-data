This paper deals with the long time behavior of solutions to a "fractional Fokker-Planck" equation of the form \partial_t f = I[f] + \text{div}(xf) where the operator I stands for a fractional Laplacian. We prove an exponential in time convergence towards equilibrium in new spaces. Indeed, such a result was already obtained in a L^2 space with a weight prescribed by the equilibrium in \cite{GI}. We improve this result obtaining the convergence in a L^1 space with a polynomial weight. To do that, we take advantage of the recent paper \cite{GMM} in which an abstract theory of enlargement of the functional space of the semigroup decay is developed.
