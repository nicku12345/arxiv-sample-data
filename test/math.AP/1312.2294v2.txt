We study the long-time behavior of solutions to nonlinear Schroedinger equations with some critical rough potential of inverse square type. The new ingredients are the interaction Morawetz-type inequalities and Sobolev norm property associated with the Lapalacian with inverse square potential. We use such properties to obtain the scattering theory for the defocusing energy-subcritical nonlinear Schroedinger equation with inverse square potential in energy space.
