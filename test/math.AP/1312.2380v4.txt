We consider the equations of motion for an incompressible Non-Newtonian fluid in a bounded Lipschitz domain G\subset\mathbb R^d during the time intervall (0,T) together with a stochastic perturbation driven by a Brownian motion W. The balance of momentum reads as dv=\mathrm{div}\, S\,dt-(\nabla v)v\,dt+\nabla\pi \,dt+f\,dt+\Phi(v)\,dW_t, where v is the velocity, \pi the pressure and f an external volume force. We assume the common power law model S(\varepsilon(v))=\big(1+|\varepsilon(v)|\big)^{p-2} \varepsilon(v) and show the existence of weak (martingale) solutions provided p>\tfrac{2d+2}{d+2}. Our approach is based on the L^\infty-truncation and a harmonic pressure decomposition which are adapted to the stochastic setting.
