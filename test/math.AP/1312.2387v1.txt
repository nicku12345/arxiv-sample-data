In the framework of the geometrically nonlinear 6-parameter resultant shell theory we give a characterization of the shells without drilling rotations. These are shells for which the strain energy function W is invariant under the superposition of drilling rotations, i.e. W is insensible to the arbitrary local rotations about the third director \boldsymbol{d}_3\,. For this type of shells we show that the strain energy density W can be represented as a function of certain combinations of the shell deformation gradient \boldsymbol{F} and the surface gradient of \boldsymbol{d}_3\,, namely W\big(\boldsymbol{F}^{ T}\boldsymbol{F} , \,   \boldsymbol{F}^T \boldsymbol{d}_3 \,, \, \boldsymbol{F}^T\mathrm{Grad}_s\boldsymbol{d}_3 \big). For the case of isotropic shells we present explicit forms of the strain energy function W having this property.
