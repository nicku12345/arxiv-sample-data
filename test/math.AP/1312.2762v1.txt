It is shown that solutions of the Cauchy for the fourth-order thin film equation becomes non-oscillatory and non-sign-changing precisely at and above the heteroclinic bifurcation point n=1.75987..., so that, possibly, these solutions begin to coincide with nonnegative solutions of a standard and well-known free-boundary problem.
