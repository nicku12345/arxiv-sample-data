We consider the modified phase-field crystal (MPFC) equation that has recently been proposed by P. Stefanovic et al. This is a variant of the phase-field crystal (PFC) equation, introduced by K.-R. Elder et al., which is characterized by the presence of an inertial term \beta\phi_{tt}. Here \phi is the phase function standing for the number density of atoms and \beta\geq 0 is a relaxation time. The associated dynamical system for the MPFC equation with respect to the parameter \beta is analyzed. More precisely, we establish the existence of a family of exponential attractors \mathcal{M}_\beta that are H\"older continuous with respect to \beta.
