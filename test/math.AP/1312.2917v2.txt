We show that "splash" singularities cannot develop in the case of locally smooth solutions of the two-fluid interface in two dimensions. More precisely, we show that the scenario of formation of singularities discovered by Castro-C\'{o}rdoba-Fefferman-Gancedo-G\'{o}mez-Serrano in the case of the water waves system, in which the interface remains locally smooth but self-intersects in finite time, is completely prevented in the case of two-fluid interfaces with positive densities.
