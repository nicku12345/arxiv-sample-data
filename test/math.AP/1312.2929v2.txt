Consider two bounded domains \Omega and \Lambda in \mathbb{R}^{2}, and two sufficiently regular probability measures \mu and \nu supported on them. By Brenier's theorem, there exists a unique transportation map T satisfying T_\#\mu=\nu and minimizing the quadratic cost \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|T(x)-x|^{2}d\mu(x). Furthermore, by Caffarelli's regularity theory for the real Monge--Amp\`ere equations, if \Lambda is convex, T is continuous.   We study the reverse problem, namely, when is T discontinuous if \Lambda fails to be convex? We prove a result guaranteeing the discontinuity of T in terms of the geometries of \Lambda and \Omega in the two-dimensional case. The main idea is to use tools of convex analysis and the extrinsic geometry of \partial\Lambda to distinguish between Brenier and Alexandrov weak solutions of the Monge--Amp\`ere equation. We also use this approach to give a new proof of a result due to Wolfson and Urbas.   We conclude by revisiting an example of Caffarelli, giving a detailed study of a discontinuous map between two explicit domains, and determining precisely where the discontinuities occur.
