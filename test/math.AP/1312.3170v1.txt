Let \Omega be a C^\infty-smooth bounded domain of \mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 1, and let the matrix {\bf a} \in C^\infty (\overline{\Omega};\R^{n^2}) be symmetric and uniformly elliptic. We consider the L^2(\Omega)-realization A of the operator -\mydiv ( {\bf a} \nabla \cdot) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We perturb A by some real valued potential V \in C_0^\infty (\Omega) and note A_V=A+V. We compute the asymptotic expansion of \mbox{tr}\left( e^{-t A_V}-e^{-t A}\right) as t \downarrow 0 for any matrix {\bf a} whose coefficients are homogeneous of degree 0. In the particular case where A is the Dirichlet Laplacian in \Omega, that is when {\bf a} is the identity of \R^{n^2}, we make the four main terms appearing in the asymptotic expansion formula explicit and prove that L^\infty-bounded sets of isospectral potentials of A are H^s-compact for s <2.
