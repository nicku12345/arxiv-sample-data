This paper focuses on the destabilizing role of resonances in high-frequency WKB solutions. Specifically, we study higher-order resonances associated with higher-order harmonics generated by nonlinearities. We give examples of systems and solutions for which such resonances generate instantaneous instabilities, even though the equations linearized around the leading WKB terms are initially stable, meaning in particular that the key destabilizing terms are not present in the data.
