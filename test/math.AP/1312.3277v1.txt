We consider here a generalized heat equation \partial_t \rho=\frac{d}{dx}\frac{d}{dW}\rho, where W is a finite measure on the one dimensional torus, and \frac{d}{dW} is the Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to W. Such equation has appeared in different contexts, being related to physical systems and representing a large class of classical and non-classical parabolic equations. As a natural assumption on W, we require that the Lebesgue measure is absolutely continuous with respect to W. The main result here presented consists in proving, for a suitable topology, a continuous dependence of the solution \rho as a function of W.
