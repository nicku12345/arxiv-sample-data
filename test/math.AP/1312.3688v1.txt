One of important problems in mathematical physics concerns derivation of point dynamics from field equations. The most common approach to this problem is based on WKB method. Here we describe a different method based on the concept of trajectory of concentration. When we applied this method to nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, we derived relativistic Newton's law and Einstein's formula for inertial mass. Here we apply the same approach to nonlinear Schrodinger equation and derive non-relativistic Newton's law for the trajectory of concentration.
