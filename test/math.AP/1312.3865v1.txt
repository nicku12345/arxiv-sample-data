This work is devoted to study the existence of infinitely many weak solutions to nonlocal equations involving a general integrodifferential operator of fractional type. These equations have a variational structure and we find a sequence of nontrivial weak solutions for them exploiting the {\mathbb{Z}}_2-symmetric version of the Mountain Pass Theorem. To make the nonlinear methods work, some careful analysis of the fractional spaces involved is necessary. As a particular case, we derive an existence theorem for the fractional Laplacian, finding nontrivial solutions of the equation  \left\{\begin{array}{ll} (-\Delta)^s u=f(x,u) & {\mbox{in}} \Omega\\ u=0 & {\mbox{in}} \erre^n\setminus \Omega. \end{array} \right.  As far as we know, all these results are new and represent a fractional version of classical theorems obtained working with Laplacian equations.
