Understanding asymptotics of gradient components in relation to the symmetrized gradient is im- portant for the analysis of buckling of slender structures. For circular cylindrical shells we obtain the exact scaling exponent of the Korn constant as a function of shell's thickness. Equally sharp results are obtained for individual components of the gradient in cylindrical coordinates. We also derive an ana- logue of the Kirchho? ansatz, whose most prominent feature is its singular dependence on the slenderness parameter, in marked contrast with the classical case of plates and rods.
