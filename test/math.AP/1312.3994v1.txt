In this paper, we investigate the photothermal effects of the plasmon resonance. Metal nanoparticles efficiently generate heat in the presence of electromagnetic radiation. The process is strongly enhanced when a fixed frequency of the incident wave illuminate on nanoprticles such that plasmon resonance happen. We shall introduce the electromagnetic radiation model and show exactly how and when the plasmon resonance happen. We then construct the heat generation and transfer model and derive the heat effect induced by plasmon resonance. Finally, we consider the heat generation under plasmon resonance in a concentric nanoshell structure.
