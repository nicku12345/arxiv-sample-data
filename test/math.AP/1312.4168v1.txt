We study the fourth order Schr\"odinger type differential inequality -\Delta^2 u + \lambda V(x)u \geq a(x)u^q with a,V\in L^1_{loc}(\mathbf{R}^N), both nonnegative, and \lambda>0. We consider nonnegative solutions without making any assumptions about their asymptotic behavior, and choosing appropriate test functions, we find a priori estimates for some type of subharmonic solutions. Finally, applying these a priori estimates, we proof a Liouville type result.
