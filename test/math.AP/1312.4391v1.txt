The purpose of this work is to analyze the mathematical model governing motion of n-component, heat conducting reactive mixture of compressible gases. We prove sequential stability of weak variational entropy solutions when the state equation essentially depends on the species concentration and the species diffusion fluxes depend on gradients of partial pressures. Of crucial importance for our analysis is the fact that viscosity coefficients vanish on vacuum and the source terms enjoy the admissibility condition dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.
