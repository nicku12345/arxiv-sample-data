In this paper, we study the blow up of a sequence of (both extrinsic and intrinsic) biharmonic maps in dimension four with bounded energy and show that there is no neck in this process. Moreover, we apply the method to provide new proofs to the removable singularity theorem and energy identity theorem of biharmonic maps.
