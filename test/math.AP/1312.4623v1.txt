Motivated by the fundamental model of a collisionless plasma, the Vlasov-Maxwell (VM) system, we consider a related, nonlinear system of partial differential equations in one space and one momentum dimension. As little is known regarding the regularity properties of solutions to the non-relativistic version of the (VM) equations, we study a simplified system which also lacks relativistic velocity corrections and prove local-in-time existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem. For special choices of initial data, global-in-time existence of these solutions is also shown. Finally, we provide an estimate which, independent of the initial data, yields additional global-in-time regularity of the associated field.
