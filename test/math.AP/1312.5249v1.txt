We study the Cauchy problem for the 1-d periodic fractional Schr\"odinger equation with cubic nonlinearity. In particular we prove local well-posedness in Sobolev spaces, for solutions evolving from rough initial data. In addition we show the existence of global-in-time infinite energy solutions. Our tools include a new Strichartz estimate on the torus along with ideas that Bourgain developed in studying the periodic cubic NLS.
