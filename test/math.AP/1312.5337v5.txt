In this paper, we consider the 3-D compressible isentropic radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) equations. The local existence of strong solutions with vacuum is firstly established when the initial data is arbitrarily large, contains vacuum and satisfy some initial layer compatibility condition. The initial mass density needs not be bounded away from zero, it may vanish in some open set or decay at infinity. We also prove that if the initial vacuum is not so irregular, then the compatibility condition of the initial data is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the existence of a unique strong solution. Finally, we prove a blow-up criterion for the local strong solution. The similar result also holds for the general barotropic flow with pressure law p_m=p_m(\rho)\in C^1(\mathbb{\overline{R}}^+).
