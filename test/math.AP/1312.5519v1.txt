In this paper we show that the incompressible Hall-MHD system without resistivity is not globally in time well-posed in any Sobolev space H^{m}(\mathbb{R}^3) for any m>\frac{7}{2}. Namely, either the system is locally ill-posed in H^{m}(\mathbb{R}^3), or it is locally well-posed, but there exists an initial data in H^{m}(\mathbb{R}^3), for which the H^{m}(\mathbb{R}^3) norm of solution blows-up in finite time if m>7/2.   In the latter case we choose an axisymmetric initial data u_0(x)=u_{0r}(r,z)e_r+ b_{0z}(r,z)e_z and B_0(x)=b_{0\theta}(r,z)e_{\theta}, and reduce the system to the axisymmetric setting. If the convection term survives sufficiently long time, then the Hall term generates the singularity on the axis of symmetry and we have    \lim\sup_{t\to t_*} \sup_{z\in \Bbb R} |\partial_z\partial_r b_\theta(r=0,z)|=\infty for some t_*>0.
