We consider the reaction-diffusion problem -\Delta_g u = f(u) in \mathcal{B}_R with zero Dirichlet boundary condition, posed in a geodesic ball \mathcal{B}_R with radius R of a Riemannian model (M,g). This class of Riemannian manifolds includes the classical \textit{space forms}, i.e., the Euclidean, elliptic, and hyperbolic spaces. For the class of semistable solutions we prove radial symmetry and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish L^\infty, L^p, and W^{1,p} estimates which are optimal and do not depend on the nonlinearity f. As an application, under standard assumptions on the nonlinearity \lambda f(u), we prove that the corresponding extremal solution u^* is bounded whenever n\leq9. To establish the optimality of our regularity results we find the extremal solution for some exponential and power nonlinearities using an improved weighted Hardy inequality.
