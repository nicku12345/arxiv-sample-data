In this paper, following the techniques of Foias and Temam, we establish suitable Gevrey class regularity of solutions to the supercritical quasi-geostrophic equations in the whole space, with initial data in "critical" Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the Gevrey class that we obtain is "near optimal" and as a corollary, we obtain temporal decay rates of higher order Sobolev norms of the solutions. Unlike the Navier-Stokes or the subcritical quasi-geostrophic equations, the low dissipation poses a difficulty in establishing Gevrey regularity. A new commutator estimate in Gevrey classes, involving the dyadic Littlewood-Paley operators, is established that allow us to exploit the cancellation properties of the equation and circumvent this difficulty.
