In this paper, the finite time extinction of solutions to the fast diffusion system u_t=\mathrm{div}(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)+v^m, v_t=\mathrm{div}(|\nabla v|^{q-2}\nabla v)+u^n is investigated, where 1<p,q<2, m,n>0 and \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N\ (N\geq1) is a bounded smooth domain. After establishing the local existence of weak solutions, the authors show that if mn>(p-1)(q-1), then any solution vanishes in finite time provided that the initial data are ``comparable"; if mn=(p-1)(q-1) and \Omega is suitably small, then the existence of extinction solutions for small initial data is proved by using the De Giorgi iteration process and comparison method. On the other hand, for 1<p=q<2 and mn<(p-1)^2, the existence of at least one non-extinction solution for any positive smooth initial data is proved.
