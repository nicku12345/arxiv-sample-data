We consider the non-linear thermoelastic plate equation in rectangular domains \Omega. More precisely, \Omega is considered to be given as the Cartesian product of whole or half spaces and a cube. First the linearized equation is treated as an abstract Cauchy problem in L^p-spaces. We take advantage of the structure of \Omega and apply operator-valued Fourier multiplier results to infer an \mathcal R-bounded \mathcal H^\infty-calculus. With the help of maximal L^p-regularity existence and uniqueness of local real-analytic strong solutions together with analytic dependency on the data is shown.
