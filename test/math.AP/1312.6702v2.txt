Let ({M},\textsf{d},\textsf{m}) be a metric measure space which satisfies the Lott-Sturm-Villani curvature-dimension condition \textsf{CD}(K,n) for some K\geq 0 and n\geq 2, and a lower n-density assumption at some point of M. We prove that if ({M},\textsf{d},\textsf{m}) supports the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality or any of its limit cases (L^p-logarithmic Sobolev inequality or Faber-Krahn-type inequality), then a global non-collapsing n-dimensional volume growth holds, i.e., there exists a universal constant C_0>0 such that \textsf{m}( B_x(\rho))\geq C_0 \rho^n for all x\in {M} and \rho\geq 0, where B_x(\rho)=\{y\in M:{\sf d}(x,y)<\rho\}. Due to the quantitative character of the volume growth estimate, we establish several rigidity results on Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature supporting Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities by exploring a quantitative Perelman-type homotopy construction developed by Munn (J. Geom. Anal., 2010). Further rigidity results are also presented on some reversible Finsler manifolds.
