The global existence of weak solutions of the incompressible viscoelastic flows in two spatial dimensions has been a long standing open problem, and it is studied in this paper. We show the global existence if the initial deformation gradient is close to the identity matrix in L^2\cap L^\infty, and the initial velocity is small in L^2 and bounded in L^p, for some p>2. While the assumption on the initial deformation gradient is automatically satisfied for the classical Oldroyd-B model, the additional assumption on the initial velocity being bounded in L^p for some p>2 may due to techniques we employed. The smallness assumption on the L^2 norm of the initial velocity is, however, natural for the global well-posedness . One of the key observations in the paper is that the velocity and the \textquotedblleft effective viscous flux\textquotedblright \mathcal{G} are sufficiently regular for positive time. The regularity of \mathcal{G} leads to a new approach for the pointwise estimate for the deformation gradient without using L^\infty bounds on the velocity gradients in spatial variables.
