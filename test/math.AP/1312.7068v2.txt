The existence of a positive solution to the following fractional semilinear equation is proven, in a situation where a ground state solution may not exist. More precisely, we consider for 0<s<1 the equation  (-\Delta)^s u + V(x)u=Q(x)|u|^{p-2}u \quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^N,\ N\geq 1, where the exponent p is superlinear but subcritical, and V>0, Q\geq 0 are bounded functions converging to 1 as |x|\to\infty. Using a min-max procedure introduced by Bahri and Li we prove the existence of a positive solution under one-sided asymptotic bounds for V and Q.
