In this paper, we solve Laplace equation analytically by using differential transform method. For this purpose, we consider four models with two Dirichlet and two Neumann boundary conditions and obtain the corresponding exact solutions. The obtained results show the simplicity of the method and massive reduction in calculations when one compares it with other iterative methods, available in literature. It is worth mentioning that here only a few number of iterations are required to reach the closed form solutions as series expansions of some known functions.
