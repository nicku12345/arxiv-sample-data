In this paper we consider weighted L^2 integrability for solutions of the wave equation. For this, we obtain some weighed L^2 estimates for the solutions with weights in Morrey-Campanato classes. Our method is based on a combination of bilinear interpolation and localization argument which makes use of Littlewood-Paley theorem and a property of Hardy-Littlewood maximal functions. We also apply the estimates to the problem of well-posedness for wave equations with potentials.
