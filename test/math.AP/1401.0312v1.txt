The paper provides a direct proof the uniqueness of solutions to the Camassa-Holm equation, based on characteristics. Given a conservative solution u=u(t,x), an equation is introduced which singles out a unique characteristic curve through each initial point. By studying the evolution of the quantities u and v= 2\arctan u_x along each characteristic, it is proved that the Cauchy problem with general initial data u_0\in H^1(\mathbb{R}) has a unique solution, globally in time.
