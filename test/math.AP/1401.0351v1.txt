It is known that solutions to second order uniformly elliptic and parabolic equations, either in divergence or nondivergence (general) form, are H\"{o}lder continuous and satisfy the interior Harnack inequality. We show that even in the one-dimensional case (x\in R^1), these properties are not preserved for equations of mixed divergence-nondivergence structure: for elliptic equations. \begin{equation*}   D_i(a^1_{ij}D_ju)+a^2_{ij}D_{ij}u=0, \end{equation*} and parabolic equations \begin{equation*} p\partial_t u=D_i(a_{ij}D_ju), \end{equation*} where p=p(t,x) is a bounded strictly positive function. The H\"{o}lder continuity and Harnack inequality are known if p does not depend either on t or on x. We essentially use homogenization techniques in our construction. Bibliography: 23 titles.
