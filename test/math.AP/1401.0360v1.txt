Let h be a quadratic form with domain W_0^{1,2}(\Ri^d) given by \[ h(\varphi)=\sum^d_{i,j=1}(\partial_i\varphi,c_{ij}\,\partial_j\varphi) \] where c_{ij}=c_{ji} are real-valued, locally bounded, measurable functions and   C=(c_{ij})\geq 0 .   If C is strongly elliptic, i.e.\ if there exist \lambda, \mu>0 such that \lambda\,I\geq C\geq \mu \,I>0, then h is closable, the closure determines a positive self-adjoint operator H on L_2(\Ri^d) which generates a submarkovian semigroup S with a positive distributional kernel~K and the kernel satisfies Gaussian upper and lower bounds. Moreover, S is conservative, i.e.\ S_t\one=\one for all t>0. Our aim is to examine converse statements.   First we establish that C is strongly elliptic if and only if h is closable, the semigroup S is conservative and K satisfies Gaussian bounds. Secondly, we prove that if the coefficients are such that a Tikhonov growth condition is satisfied then S is conservative. Thus in this case strong ellipticity of C is equivalent to closability of h together with Gaussian bounds on K. Finally we consider coefficients c_{ij}\in W^{1,\infty}_{\rm loc}(\Ri^d). It follows that h is closable and a growth condition of the T\"acklind type is sufficient to establish the equivalence of strong ellipticity of C and Gaussian bounds on K.
