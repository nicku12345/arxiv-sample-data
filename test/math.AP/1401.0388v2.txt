In this paper, we intend to reveal how the fractional dissipation (-\Delta)^{\alpha} affects the regularity of weak solutions to the 3d generalized Navier-Stokes equations. Precisely, it will be shown that the (5-4\alpha)/2\alpha dimensional Hausdorff measure of possible time singular points of weak solutions on the interval (0,\infty) is zero when 5/6\le\alpha< 5/4. To this end, the eventual regularity for the weak solutions is firstly established in the same range of \alpha. It is worth noting that when the dissipation index \alpha varies from 5/6 to  5/4, the corresponding Hausdorff dimension is from 1 to 0. Hence, it seems that the Hausdorff dimension obtained is optimal. Our results rely on the fact that the space H^{\alpha} is the critical space or subcritical space to this system when \alpha\geq5/6.
