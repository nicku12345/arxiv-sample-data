Consider reaction-diffusion equation u_t=\Delta u + f(x,u) with x\in\mathbb{R}^d and general inhomogeneous ignition reaction f\ge 0 vanishing at u=0,1. Typical solutions 0\le u\le 1 transition from 0 to 1 as time progresses, and we study them in the region where this transition occurs. Under fairly general qualitative hypotheses on f we show that in dimensions d\le 3, the Hausdorff distance of the super-level sets \{u\ge\epsilon\} and \{u\ge 1-\epsilon\} remains uniformly bounded in time for each \epsilon\in(0,1). Thus, u remains uniformly in time close to the characteristic function of \{u\ge\tfrac 12\} in the sense of Hausdorff distance of super-level sets. We also show that \{u\ge\tfrac 12\} expands with average speed (over any long enough time interval) between the two spreading speeds corresponding to any x-independent lower and upper bounds on f. On the other hand, these results turn out to be false in dimensions d\ge 4, at least without further quantitative hypotheses on f. The proof for d\le 3 is based on showing that as the solution propagates, small values of u cannot escape far ahead of values close to 1. The proof for d\ge 4 involves construction of a counter-example for which this fails.   Such results were before known for d=1 but are new for general non-periodic media in dimensions d\ge 2 (some are also new for homogeneous and periodic media). They extend in a somewhat weaker sense to monostable, bistable, and mixed reaction types, as well as to transitions between general equilibria u^-<u^+ of the PDE, and to solutions not necessarily satisfying u^-\le u\le u^+.
