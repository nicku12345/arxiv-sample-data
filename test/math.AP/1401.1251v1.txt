We investigate the existence of non-topological solutions (u_1,u_2) satisfying   u_{i}(x)=-2\beta_i\ln|x|+O(1),\quad\text{as }|x|\rightarrow +\infty, such that \beta_i>1 and   (\beta_1-1)(\beta_2-1)>(N_1+1)(N_2+1),   for a skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system. By the bubbling analysis and the Leray-Schauder degree theory, we get the existence results except for a finite set of curves: \frac{N_1}{\beta_1+N_1}+\frac{N_2}{\beta_2+N_2}=\frac{k-1}{k},k=2,\cdots,\max(N_1,N_2). This generalizes a previous work by Choe-Kim-Lin \cite{ChoeKimLin2011}.
