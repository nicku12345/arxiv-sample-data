The purpose of this article is to prove the H\"older continuity up to the boundary of the displacement vector and the microrotation matrix for the quasistatic, rate-independent Armstrong-Frederick cyclic hardening plasticity model with Cosserat effects. This model is of non-monotone and non-associated type. In the case of two space dimensions we use the hole-filling technique of Widman and the Morrey's Dirichlet growth theorem.
