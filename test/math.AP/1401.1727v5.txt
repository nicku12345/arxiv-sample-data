We study a double Cahn-Hilliard type functional related to the Gross-Pitaevskii energy of two-components Bose-Einstein condensates. In the case of large but same order intercomponent and intracomponent coupling strengths, we prove \Gamma-convergence to a perimeter minimisation functional with an inhomogeneous surface tension. We study the asymptotic behavior of the surface tension as the ratio between the intercomponent and intracomponent coupling strengths becomes very small or very large. We obtain as a consequence, symmetry breaking of the minimisers for the harmonic potential when this radio is sufficiently large.
