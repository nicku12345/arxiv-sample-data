This paper deals with approximating properties of the newly defined q-generalization of the genuine Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials in the case q>1, whcih are no longer positive linear operators on C[0,1]. Quantitative estimates of the convergence, the Voronovskaja type theorem and saturation of convergence for complex genuine q-Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials attached to analytic functions in compact disks are given. In particular, it is proved that for functions analytic in \left\{ z\in\mathbb{C}:\left\vert z\right\vert <R\right\} , R>q, the rate of approximation by the genuine q-Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials (q>1) is of order q^{-n} versus 1/n for the classical genuine Bernstein-Durrmeyer polynomials. We give explicit formulas of Voronovskaja type for the genuine q-Bernstein-Durrmeyer for q>1.
