We study a spectral problem (\mathscr{P}^{\delta}) for a diffusion like equation in a 3D domain \Omega. The main originality lies in the presence of a parameter \sigma^{\delta}, whose sign changes on \Omega, in the principal part of the operator we consider. More precisely, \sigma^{\delta} is positive on \Omega except in a small inclusion of size \delta>0. Because of the sign-change of \sigma^{\delta}, for all \delta>0 the spectrum of (\mathscr{P}^{\delta}) consists of two sequences converging to \pm\infty. However, at the limit \delta=0, the small inclusion vanishes so that there should only remain positive spectrum for (\mathscr{P}^{\delta}). What happens to the negative spectrum? In this paper, we prove that the positive spectrum of (\mathscr{P}^{\delta}) tends to the spectrum of the problem without the small inclusion. On the other hand, we establish that each negative eigenvalue of (\mathscr{P}^{\delta}) behaves like \delta^{-2}\mu for some constant \mu<0. We also show that the eigenfunctions associated with the negative eigenvalues are localized around the small inclusion. We end the article providing 2D numerical experiments illustrating these results.
