We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with combined nonlinearities, one of which is defocusing mass-critical and the other is focusing energy-critical or energy-subcritical. The threshold is given by means of variational argument. We establish the profile decomposition in H^1(\Bbb R^d) and then utilize the concentration-compactness method to show the global wellposedness and scattering versus blowup in H^1(\Bbb R^d) below the threshold for radial data when d\leq4.
