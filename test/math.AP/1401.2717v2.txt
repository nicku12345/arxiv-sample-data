We study the system of equations of motion for inextensible strings. This system possesses many internal symmetries, and is related to discontinuous systems of conservation laws and the total variation wave equation. We prove existence of generalized Young measure solutions with non-negative tension after transforming the problem into a system of conservation laws and approximating it with a regularized system for which we obtain uniform estimates of the energy and the tension. We also discuss sufficient conditions for non-negativity of the tension for strong solutions.
