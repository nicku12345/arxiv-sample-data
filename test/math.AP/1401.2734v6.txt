Global upper bounds with respect to regular norms of the incompressible Navier Stokes equation solution with regular data are constructed by an infinite scheme, where we work in bounded ZFC with bounded quantifiers and explicit infinitesimals. Trotter product formulas with infinitesimal error are obtained, which simplify for calculi with explicit infinitesimal and make the spatial effects needed in order to obtain global schemes more transparent.
