Lubrication equations for a surfactant-driven flow of a thin layer of fluid are considered with a singular surfactant-dependent surface tension. It is shown that there exists a bounded traveling wave solution which connects a fully surfactant-coated film to an uncoated film. The regularity of the traveling wave depends on whether or not surface diffusion of the insoluble surfactant is included.
