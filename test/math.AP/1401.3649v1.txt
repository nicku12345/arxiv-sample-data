Several mathematical models of tumor growth are now commonly used to explain medical observations and predict cancer evolution based on images. These models incorporate mechanical laws for tissue compression combined with rules for nutrients availability which can differ depending on the situation under consideration, in vivo or in vitro. Numerical solutions exhibit, as expected from medical observations, a proliferative rim and a necrotic core. However, their precise profiles are rather complex, both in one and two dimensions.
