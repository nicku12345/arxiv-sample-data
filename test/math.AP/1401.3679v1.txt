We show that, for a given H\"older continuous curve in \{(\gamma(t),t)\,:\, t>0\} \subset R^3\times R^+, there exists a solution to the Navier-Stokes system for an incompressible fluid in R^3 which is smooth outside this curve and singular on it. This is a pointwise solution of the system outside the curve, however, as a distributional solution on R^3\times R^+, it solves an analogous Navier-Stokes system with a singular force concentrated on the curve.
