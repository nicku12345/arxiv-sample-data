On a class of asymptotically conical manifolds, we prove two types of low frequency estimates for the resolvent of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The first result is a uniform  L^2 \rightarrow L^2  bound for  \langle r \rangle^{-1} (- \Delta_G - z)^{-1} \langle r \rangle^{-1}  when  \mbox{Re}(z)  is small, with the optimal weight  \langle r \rangle^{-1} . The second one is about powers of the resolvent. For any integer N, we prove uniform  L^2 \rightarrow L^2  bounds for  \langle \epsilon r \rangle^{-N} (-\epsilon^{-2} \Delta_G - Z)^{-N} \langle \epsilon r \rangle^{-N}  when  \mbox{Re}(Z)  belongs to a compact subset of  (0,+\infty)  and  0 < \epsilon \ll 1 . These results are obtained by proving similar estimates on a pure cone with a long range perturbation of the metric at infinity.
