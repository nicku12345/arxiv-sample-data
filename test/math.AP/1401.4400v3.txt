We are interested in entire solutions for the semilinear biharmonic equation \Delta^{2}u=f(u) in \R^N, where f(u)=e^{u} or -u^{-p}\ (p>0). For the exponential case, we prove that any classical entire solution verifies -\Delta u>0 without any restriction, which completes the results in \cite{Dupaigne, xu-wei} and yields a nonexistence result in \R^2 ; we obtain also a refined asymptotic expansion of radial separatrix solution for N=3, which answers a question in \cite{Berchio}. For the negative power case, we show the nonexistence of the classical entire solution for any 0<p\leq1.
