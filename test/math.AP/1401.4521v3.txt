We prove space and time regularity for solutions of fully nonlinear parabolic integro-differential equations with rough kernels. We consider parabolic equations u_t = \I u, where \I is translation invariant and elliptic with respect to the class \mathcal L_0(\sigma) of Caffarelli and Silvestre, \sigma\in(0,2) being the order of \I. We prove that if u is a viscosity solution in B_1 \times (-1,0] which is merely bounded in \R^n \times (-1,0], then u is C^\beta in space and C^{\beta/\sigma} in time in \overline{B_{1/2}} \times [-1/2,0], for all \beta< \min\{\sigma, 1+\alpha\}, where \alpha>0. Our proof combines a Liouville type theorem ---relaying on the nonlocal parabolic C^\alpha estimate of Chang and D\'avila--- and a blow up and compactness argument.
