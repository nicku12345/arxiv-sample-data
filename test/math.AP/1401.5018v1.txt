This paper establishes the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of strong solutions in H^{s} for s > n/2 to the viscous, non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in \mathbb{R}^{n}, n=2, 3, as well as for a related model where the advection terms are removed from the velocity equation. The uniform bounds required for proving existence are established by means of a new estimate, which is a partial generalisation of the commutator estimate of Kato & Ponce (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 41(7), 891-907, 1988).
