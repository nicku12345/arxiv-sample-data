We study the fractional Schr\"odinger equations in \mathbb R^{1+d}, d \geq 3 of order {d}/({d-1}) < \al < 2. Under the angular regularity assumption we prove linear and nonlinear profile decompositions which extend the previous results \cite{chkl2} to data without radial assumption. As applications we show blowup phenomena of solutions to mass-critical fractional Hartree equations.
