In this paper, we prove new multilinear Strichartz estimates, which are obtained by using techniques of Bourgain. These estimates lead to new critical well-posedness results for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on irrational tori in two and three dimensions with small initial data. In three dimensions, this includes the energy critical case. This extends recent work of Guo-Oh-Wang.
