In this paper we show a structural stability result for water waves. The main motivation for this result is that we would like to exhibit a water wave whose interface starts as a graph and ends in a splash. Numerical simulations lead to an approximate solution with the desired behaviour. The stability result will conclude that near the approximate solution to water waves there is an exact solution.
