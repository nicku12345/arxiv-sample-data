In this paper we establish an improvement of tilt-excess decay estimate for the Allen-Cahn equation, and use this to give a new proof of Savin's theorem on the uniform C^{1,\alpha} regularity of flat level sets, which then implies the one dimensional symmetry of minimizers in \mathbb{R}^n for n\leq 7. This generalizes Allard's \varepsilon-regularity theorem for stationary varifolds to the setting of Allen-Cahn equations.
