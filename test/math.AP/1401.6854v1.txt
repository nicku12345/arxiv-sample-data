We introduce (integro-differential) harmonic maps into spheres, which are defined as critical points of the Besov-Slobodeckij energy \int\limits_{\Omega}\int\limits_{\Omega} \frac{|v(x)-v(y)|^{p_s}}{|x-y|^{n+sp_s}}\ dx\ dy. For p_s = 2 these are the classical fractional harmonic maps first considered by Da Lio and Riviere. For p_s \neq 2 this is a new energy which has degenerate, non-local Euler-Lagrange equations. For the critical case, p_s = n/s, we show Holder continuity of these maps.
