We study a derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, allowing non-integer powers in the nonlinearity, |u|^{2\sigma} u_x. Making careful use of the energy method, we are able to establish short-time existence of solutions with initial data in the energy space, H^1. For more regular initial data, we establish not just existence of solutions, but also well-posedness of the initial value problem. These results hold for real-valued \sigma\geq 1, while prior existence results in the literature require integer-valued \sigma or \sigma sufficiently large (\sigma \geq 5/2), or use higher-regularity function spaces.
