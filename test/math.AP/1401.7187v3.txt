We study existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to (F) \partial\_t u+ (-\Delta)^\alphau+h(t, u)=0  in (0,\infty)\times\R^N,with initial condition u(0,\cdot)=\nu in \R^N, where N\ge2, the operator (-\Delta)^\alphais the fractional Laplacian with \alpha\in(0,1), \nu isa bounded Radon measure and h:(0,\infty)\times\R\to\R is a continuous function satisfying a subcritical integrability condition.In particular, if h(t,u)=t^\beta u^p with \beta\textgreater{}-1 and 0 \textless{} p \textless{} p^*\_\beta:=1+\frac{2\alpha(1+\beta)}{N}, we prove that there exists a unique weak solution u\_k to (F) with \nu=k\delta\_0, where \delta\_0 is the Dirac mass at the origin. We obtain that u\_k\to\infty in (0,\infty)\times\R^N as k\to\infty for p\in(0,1] and the limit of u\_k exists as k\to\infty when 1 \textless{} p \textless{} p^*\_\beta, we denote it by u\_\infty.When 1+\frac{2\alpha(1+\beta)}{N+2\alpha}:=p^{**}\_\beta\textless{} p \textless{} p^*\_\beta,u\_\infty is the minimal self-similar solution of (F)\_\infty \partial\_t u+ (-\Delta)^\alpha u+t^\beta u^p=0  in (0,\infty)\times\R^N with the initial condition u(0,\cdot)=0 in \R^N\setminus\{0\} and it satisfies u\_\infty(0,x)=0 for x\neq 0.While if 1\textless{} p \textless{} p^{**}\_\beta, then u\_\infty\equiv U\_p, where U\_p is the maximal solution of the differential equation y'+t^\beta y^p=0 on \R\_+.
