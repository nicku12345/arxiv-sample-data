This paper explores two generalizations of the classical Aubin-Lions Lemma. First we give a sufficient condition to commute weak limit and multiplication of two functions. We deduce from this criteria a compactness Theorem for degenerate parabolic equations. Secondly, we state and prove a compactness Theorem for non-cylindrical domains, including the case of dual estimates involving only divergence-free test functions.
