We analyze a homogenization limit for the linear wave equation of second order. The spatial operator is assumed to be of divergence form with an oscillatory coefficient matrix a^\varepsilon that is periodic with characteristic length scale \varepsilon; no spatial symmetry properties are imposed. Classical homogenization theory allows to describe solutions u^\varepsilon well by a non-dispersive wave equation on fixed time intervals (0,T). Instead, when larger time intervals are considered, dispersive effects are observed. In this contribution we present a well-posed weakly dispersive equation with homogeneous coefficients such that its solutions w^\varepsilon describe u^\varepsilon well on time intervals (0,T\varepsilon^{-2}). More precisely, we provide a norm and uniform error estimates of the form \| u^\varepsilon(t) - w^\varepsilon(t) \| \le C\varepsilon for t\in (0,T\varepsilon^{-2}). They are accompanied by computable formulas for all coefficients in the effective models. We additionally provide an \varepsilon-independent equation of third order that describes dispersion along rays and we present numerical examples.
