We announce a local T(b) theorem, an inductive scheme, and L^p extrapolation results for L^2 square function estimates related to the analysis of integral operators that act on Ahlfors-David regular sets of arbitrary codimension in ambient quasi-metric spaces. The inductive scheme is a natural application of the local T(b) theorem and it implies the stability of L^2 square function estimates under the so-called big pieces functor. In particular, this analysis implies L^p and Hardy space square function estimates for integral operators on uniformly rectifiable subsets of the Euclidean space.
