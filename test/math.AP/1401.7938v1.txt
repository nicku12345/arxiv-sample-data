The paper is a comprehensive study of the L_p and the Schauder estimates for higher-order divergence type parabolic systems with discontinuous coefficients in the half space and cylindrical domains with conormal derivative boundary condition. For the L_p estimates, we assume that the leading coefficients are only bounded measurable in the t variable and VMO with respect to x. We also prove the Schauder estimates in two situations: the coefficients are H\"older continuous only in the x variable; the coefficients are H\"older continuous in both variables.
