Criteria for the existence of T-periodic solutions of nonautonomous parabolic equation u_t = \Delta u + f(t,x,u), x\in\mathbb{R}^N, t>0 with asymptotically linear f will be provided. It is expressed in terms of time average function \hat f of the nonlinear term f and the spectrum of the Laplace operator \Delta on \mathbb{R}^N. One of them says that if the derivative \hat f_\infty of \hat f at infinity does not interact with the spectrum of \Delta, i.e. \mathrm{Ker} (-\Delta + \hat f_\infty)=\{0\}, then the parabolic equation admits a T-periodic solution. Another theorem is derived in the situation, where the linearization at 0 and infinity differ topologically, i.e. the total multiplicities of negative eigenvalues of the averaged linearizations at 0 and \infty are different mod 2.
