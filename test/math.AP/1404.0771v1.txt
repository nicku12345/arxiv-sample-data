We study the Schr\"{o}dinger equation: \begin{eqnarray} - \Delta u+V(x)u+f(x,u)=0,\qquad u\in H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{N}),\nonumber \end{eqnarray} where V is periodic and f is periodic in the x-variables, 0 is in a gap of the spectrum of the operator -\Delta+V. We prove that under some new assumptions for f, this equation has a nontrivial solution. Our assumptions for the nonlinearity f are very weak and greatly different from the known assumptions in the literature.
