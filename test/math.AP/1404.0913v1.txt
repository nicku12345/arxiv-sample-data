We consider critical points of the energy E(v) := \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |\nabla^s v|^{\frac{n}{s}}, where v maps locally into the sphere or SO(N), and \nabla^s = (\partial_1^s,\ldots,\partial_n^s) is the formal fractional gradient, i.e. \partial_\alpha^s is a composition of the fractional laplacian with the \alpha-th Riesz transform. We show that critical points of this energy are H\"older continuous.   As a special case, for s = 1, we obtain a new, more stable proof of Fuchs and Strzelecki's regularity result of n-harmonic maps into the sphere, which is interesting on its own.
