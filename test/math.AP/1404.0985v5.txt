In this paper, we study the extremal problem for the Strichartz inequality for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation on the \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^2; we provide a new proof to the characterization of the extremal functions. The only extremal functions are Gaussian functions up to the natural symmetry of the Strichartz inequality, which was investigated previously by Foschi \cite{Foschi:2007:maxi-strichartz-2d} and Hundertmark-Zharnitsky \cite{Hundertmark-Zharnitsky:2006:maximizers-Strichartz-low-dimensions}.
