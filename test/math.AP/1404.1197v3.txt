We study fine boundary regularity properties of solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic integro-differential equations of order 2s, with s\in(0,1).   We consider the class of nonlocal operators \mathcal L_*\subset \mathcal L_0, which consists of infinitesimal generators of stable L\'evy processes belonging to the class \mathcal L_0 of Caffarelli-Silvestre. For fully nonlinear operators I elliptic with respect to \mathcal L_*, we prove that solutions to I u=f in \Omega, u=0 in \mathbb R^n\setminus\Omega, satisfy u/d^s\in C^{s+\gamma}(\overline\Omega), where d is the distance to \partial\Omega and f\in C^\gamma.   We expect the class \mathcal L_* to be the largest scale invariant subclass of \mathcal L_0 for which this result is true. In this direction, we show that the class \mathcal L_0 is too large for all solutions to behave like d^s.   The constants in all the estimates in this paper remain bounded as the order of the equation approaches 2. Thus, in the limit s\uparrow1 we recover the celebrated boundary regularity result due to Krylov for fully nonlinear elliptic equations.
