We show how a theorem about solvability in C^{1,1} of special Isaacs equations can be used to obtain existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions of general uniformly nondegenerate Isaacs equations. We apply it also to establish the C^{1+\chi} regularity of viscosity solutions and show that finite-difference approximations have an algebraic rate of convergence. The main coefficients of the Isaacs equations are supposed to be in C^{\gamma} with \gamma slightly less than 1/2.
