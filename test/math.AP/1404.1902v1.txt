In this paper, from the group-theoretic point of view it is investigated such class of the generalized Kompaneets equations (GKEs): u_t=\frac1{x^2}\cdot\left[x^4(u_x+f(u))\right]_x, \ (t,x) \in \mathbb{R}_{+} \times \mathbb{R}_{+}, where u=u(t,x), u_t=\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, u_x=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}, u_{xx}=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}; f(u) is an arbitrary smooth function of the variable u. Using the Lie--Ovsiannikov algorithm, the group classification of the class under study is carried out. It is shown that the kernel algebra of the full groups of the GKEs is the one-dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}^\cap=\langle \partial_t \rangle. Using the direct method, the equivalence group G^\sim of the class is found. It is obtained six non-equivalent (up to the equivalence transformations from the group G^\sim) GKEs that allow wider invariance algebras than \mathfrak{g}^\cap. It is shown that, among the non-linear equations from the class, the GKE with the function f(u)=u^{\frac43} has the maximal symmetry properties, namely, it admits a three-dimensional maximal Lie invariance algebra. Using the obtained operators, it is found all possible non-equivalent group-invariant exact solutions of the GKE under consider.
