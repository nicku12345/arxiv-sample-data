In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a "steady" spiral moving with forced mean curvature motion. This spiral has a stationary shape and rotates with constant angular velocity. Under appropriate conditions on the initial data, we also show the long time convergence (up to some subsequence in time) of the solution of the Cauchy problem to the steady state. This result is based on a new Liouville result which is of independent interest.
