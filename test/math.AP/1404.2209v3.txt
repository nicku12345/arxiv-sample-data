We analyze the finite-time blow-up of solutions of the heat flow for k-corotational maps \mathbb R^d\to S^d. For each dimension d>2+k(2+2\sqrt{2}) we construct a countable family of blow-up solutions via a method of matched asymptotics by glueing a re-scaled harmonic map to the singular self-similar solution: the equatorial map. We find that the blow-up rates of the constructed solutions are closely related to the eigenvalues of the self-similar solution. In the case of 1-corotational maps our solutions are stable and represent the generic blow-up.
