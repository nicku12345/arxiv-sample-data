We consider the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system \begin{eqnarray}\left\{\begin{array} [c]{ll} -\Delta u+V(x) u+|u|^{p-2}u=\lambda \phi u, & \mbox{in}\mathbb{R}^{3},\\ -\Delta\phi= u^{2}, & \mbox{in}\mathbb{R}^{3}. \end{array} \right.\nonumber \end{eqnarray} where \lambda>0 is a parameter, 3< p<6, V\in C(\mathbb{R}^{3})  is 1-periodic in x_j for j = 1,2,3 and 0 is in a spectral gap of the operator -\Delta+V. This system is strongly indefinite, i.e., the operator -\Delta+V has infinite-dimensional negative and positive spaces and it has a competitive interplay of the nonlinearities |u|^{p-2}u and \lambda \phi u.   Moreover, the functional corresponding to this system does not satisfy the Palai-Smale condition. Using a new infinite-dimensional linking theorem, we prove that, for sufficiently small \lambda>0, this system has a nontrivial solution.
