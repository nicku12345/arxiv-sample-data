The aim of this paper is to investigate Green's function for parabolic and elliptic systems satisfying a possibly nonlocal Robin-type boundary condition. We construct Green's function for parabolic systems with time-dependent coefficients satisfying a possibly nonlocal Robin-type boundary condition assuming that weak solutions of the system are locally H\"{o}lder continuous in the interior of the domain, and as a corollary we construct Green's function for elliptic system with a Robin-type condition. Also, we obtain Gaussian bound for Robin Green's function under an additional assumption that weak solutions of Robin problem are locally bounded up to the boundary. We provide some examples satisfying such a local boundedness property, and thus have Gaussian bounds for their Green's functions.
