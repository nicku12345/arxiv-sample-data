We provide a comprehensive analysis of sharp bilinear estimates of Ozawa-Tsutsumi type for solutions u of the free Schr\"odinger equation, which give sharp control on |u|^2 in classical Sobolev spaces. In particular, we provide a generalization of their estimates in such a way that provides a unification with some sharp bilinear estimates proved by Carneiro and Planchon-Vega, via entirely different methods, by seeing them all as special cases of a one parameter family of sharp estimates. We show that the extremal functions are solutions of the Maxwell-Boltzmann functional equation and provide a new proof that this equation admits only Gaussian solutions. We also make a connection to certain sharp estimates on u^2 involving certain dispersive Sobolev norms.
