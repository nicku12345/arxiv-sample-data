In this paper we prove a quantitative form of Landis' conjecture in the plane. Precisely, let W(z) be a measurable real vector-valued function and V(z)\ge 0 be a real measurable scalar function, satisfying \|W\|_{L^{\infty}({\mathbf R}^2)}\le 1 and \|V\|_{L^{\infty}({\mathbf R}^2)}\le 1. Let u be a real solution of \Delta u-\nabla(Wu)-Vu=0 in {\mathbf R}^2. Assume that u(0)=1 and |u(z)|\le\exp(C_0|z|). Then u satisfies \underset{{|z_0|=R}}{\inf}\,\underset{|z-z_0|<1}{\sup}|u(z)|\ge \exp(-CR\log R), where C depends on C_0. In addition to the case of the whole plane, we also establish a quantitative form of Landis' conjecture defined in an exterior domain.
