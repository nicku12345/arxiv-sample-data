We prove the absence of non-scattering energies for potentials in the plane having a corner of angle smaller than \pi. This extends the earlier result of Bl{\aa}sten, P\"aiv\"arinta and Sylvester who considered rectangular corners. In three dimensions, we prove a similar result for any potential with a circular conic corner whose opening angle is outside a countable subset of (0,\pi).
