Let (M,g) be a smooth compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n \geq 2. This paper concerns to the validity of the optimal Riemannian L^1-Entropy inequality \[ {\bf Ent}_{dv_g}(u) \leq n \log \left(A_{opt} \|D u\|_{BV(M)} + B_{opt}\right) \] for all u \in BV(M) with \|u\|_{L^1(M)} = 1 and existence of extremal functions. In particular, we prove that this optimal inequality is equivalent a optimal L^1-Sobolev inequality obtained by Druet [6].
