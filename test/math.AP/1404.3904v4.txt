We prove that the energy over balls of entire, nonconstant, bounded solutions to the vector Allen-Cahn equation grows faster than (\ln R)^k R^{n-2}, for any k>0, as the volume R^n of the ball tends to infinity. This improves the growth rate of order R^{n-2} that follows from the general weak monotonicity formula. Moreover, our estimate can be considered as an approximation to the corresponding rate of order R^{n-1} that is known to hold in the scalar case.
