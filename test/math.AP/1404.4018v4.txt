We consider in this work some class of strongly perturbed for the semilinear heat equation with Sobolev sub-critical power nonlinearity. We first derive a Lyapunov functional in similarity variables and then use it to derive the blow-up rate. We also classify all possible asymptotic behaviors of the solution when it approaches to singularity. Finally, we describe precisely the blow-up profiles corresponding to these behaviors.
