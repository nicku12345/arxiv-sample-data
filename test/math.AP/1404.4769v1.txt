In this paper, we propose a kinetic model describing the collective motion by chemotaxis of two species in interaction emitting the same chemoattractant. Such model can be seen as a generalisation to several species of the Othmer-Dunbar-Alt model which takes into account the run-and-tumble process of bacteria. Existence of weak solutions for this two-species kinetic model is studied and the convergence of its diffusive limit towards a macroscopic model of Keller-Segel type is analysed.
