We study the large time behavior of solutions of the PDE |v_t|^{p-2}v_t=\Delta_p v. A special property of this equation is that the Rayleigh quotient \int_{\Omega}|Dv(x,t)|^pdx /\int_{\Omega}|v(x,t)|^pdx is nonincreasing in time along solutions. As t tends to infinity, this ratio converges to the optimal constant in Poincar\'{e}'s inequality. Moreover, appropriately scaled solutions converge to a function for which equality holds in this inequality. An interesting limiting equation also arises when p tends to infinity, which provides a new approach to approximating ground states of the infinity Laplacian.
