An elliptic equation of order 2m with general nonlocal boundary-value conditions, in a plane bounded domain G with piecewise smooth boundary, is considered. Generalized solutions belonging to the Sobolev space W_2^m(G) are studied. The Fredholm property of the unbounded operator corresponding to the elliptic equation, acting on L_2(G), and defined for functions from the space W_2^m(G) that satisfy homogeneous nonlocal conditions is proved.
