In this paper, we present counterexamples showing that for any p\in (1,\infty), p\neq 2, there is a non-divergence form uniformly elliptic operator with piecewise constant coefficients in \mathbb{R}^2 (constant on each quadrant in \mathbb{R}^2) for which there is no W^2_p estimate. The corresponding examples in the divergence case are also discussed. One implication of these examples is that the ranges of p are sharp in the recent results obtained in [4,5] for non-divergence type elliptic and parabolic equations in a half space with the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition when the coefficients do not have any regularity in a tangential direction.
