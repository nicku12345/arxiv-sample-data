In this work we use functional methods to prove the boundedness and global existence of solutions for a class of strongly coupled parabolic systems. We apply the results to deduce the global existence of solutions for a classic Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) type model, for an extended range of the self-diffusion and cross-diffusion coefficients than those available in the current literature. We provide numerical simulations in 2D, via a spectral Galerkin method to verify our global existence results, as well as to visualize the dynamics of the system.
