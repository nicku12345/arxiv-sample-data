The aim of this paper is to establish regularity for weak solutions to the nondiagonal quasilinear degenerate elliptic systems related to H\"{o}rmander's vector fields, where the coefficients are bounded with vanishing mean oscillation. We first prove L^p(p \ge 2) estimates for gradients of weak solutions by using a priori estimates and a known reverse H\"{o}lder inequality, and consider regularity to the corresponding nondiagonal homogeneous degenerate elliptic systems. Then we get higher Morrey and Campanato estimates for gradients of weak solutions to original systems and H\"{o}lder estimates for weak solutions.
