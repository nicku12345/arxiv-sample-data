The aim of this paper is to consider the linear ultraparabolic equation with bounded and VMO coefficients a_{ij} (z). Assume that the operator L_0 obtained by freezing the coefficients a_{ij}(z) at any point {z_0} \in {\mathbb{R}^{N + 1}} is hypoelliptic. We first establish a Caccioppoli type inequality by choosing a cutoff function, a Sobolev type inequality by prosperities of the fundamental solution to L_0, and a Poincar\'{e} type inequality with a new cutoff function. Then L^p estimate for weak solutions is derived by using the reverse H\"{o}lder inequality on homogeneous spaces. Finally, higher Morrey estimates for weak solutions to the above equation are shown by investigating a homogeneous ultraparabolic equation of variable coefficients with a nonhomogeneous boundary value condition, and a nonhomogeneous ultraparabolic equation of variable coefficients with homogeneous boundary value condition.
