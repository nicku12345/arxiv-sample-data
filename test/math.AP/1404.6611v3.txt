Let Q_{N} be N-anisotropic Laplacian operator, which contains the ordinary Laplacian operator, N-Laplacian operator and anisotropic Laplacian operator. In this paper, we firstly obtain the properties for Q_{N}, which contain the weak maximal principle, the comparison principle and the mean value property. Then a priori estimates and blow-up analysis for solutions of -Q_{N}u=Ve^{u} in bounded domain in \mathbb{R}^{N}, N\geq 2 are established. Finally, the behavior of sole blow-up point is further considered.
