We study a multi-dimensional nonlocal active scalar equation of the form u_t+v\cdot \nabla u=0 in \mathbb R^+\times \mathbb R^d, where v=\Lambda^{-2+\alpha}\nabla u with \Lambda=(-\Delta)^{1/2}. We show that when \alpha\in (0,2] certain radial solutions develop gradient blowup in finite time. In the case when \alpha=0, the equations are globally well-posed with arbitrary initial data in suitable Sobolev spaces.
