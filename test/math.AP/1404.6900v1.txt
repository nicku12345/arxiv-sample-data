Unbounded operators corresponding to nonlocal elliptic problems on a bounded region G\subset\mathbb R^2 are considered. The domain of these operators consists of functions from the Sobolev space W_2^m(G) being generalized solutions of the corresponding 2m-order elliptic equation with right-hand side from L_2(G) and satisfying homogeneous nonlocal boundary conditions. It is known that such unbounded operators have the Fredholm property. It is proved in the paper that low-order terms in the differential equation do not affect the index of the operator. Conditions under which nonlocal perturbations on the boundary do not change the index are also formulated.
