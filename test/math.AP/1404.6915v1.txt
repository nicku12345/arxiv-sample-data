For any \epsilon >0 we show the existence of continuous periodic weak solutions v of the Euler equations which do not conserve the kinetic energy and belong to the space L^1_t (C_x^{\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon}), namely x\mapsto v (x,t) is (\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon)-H\"older continuous in space at a.e. time t and the integral \int [v(\cdot, t)]_{\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon} dt is finite. A well-known open conjecture of L. Onsager claims that such solutions exist even in the class L^\infty_t (C_x^{\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon}).
