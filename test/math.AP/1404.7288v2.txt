We consider solutions of the competitive elliptic system \[   \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u_i = - \sum_{j \neq i} u_i u_j^2 & \text{in \mathbb{R}^N} \\ u_i >0 & \text{in \mathbb{R}^N} \end{array}\right. \qquad i=1,\dots,k. \] We are concerned with the classification of entire solutions, according with their growth rate. The prototype of our main results is the following: there exists a function \delta=\delta(k,N) \in \mathbb{N}, increasing in k, such that if (u_1,\dots,u_k) is a solution and \[ u_1(x)+\cdots+u_k(x) \le C(1+|x|^d) \qquad \text{for every x \in \mathbb{R}^N}, \] then d \ge \delta. This means that the number of components k of the solution imposes an increasing in k minimal growth on the solution itself. If N=2, the expression of \delta is explicit and optimal, while in higher dimension it can be characterized in terms of an optimal partition problem. We discuss the sharpness of our results and, as a further step, for every N \ge 2 we can prove the 1-dimensional symmetry of the solutions satisfying suitable assumptions, extending known results which are available for k=2. The proofs rest upon a blow-down analysis and on some monotonicity formulae.
