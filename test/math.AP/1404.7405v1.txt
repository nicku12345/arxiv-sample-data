In this paper we study the backward uniqueness for parabolic equations with non-Lipschitz coefficients in time and space. The result presented here improves an old uniqueness theorem due to Lions and Malgrange [Math. Scand. {\bf 8} (1960), 277--286] and some more recent results of Del Santo and Prizzi [J. Math. Pures Appl. {\bf 84} (2005), 471--491; Ann. Mat. Pura Appl., to appear].
