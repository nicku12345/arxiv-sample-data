The Allen-Cahn equation, coupled with dynamic boundary conditions, has recently received a good deal of attention. The new issue of this paper is the setting of a rather general mass constraint which may involve either the solution inside the domain or its trace on the boundary. The system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be formulated as variational inequality. The presence of the constraint in the evolution process leads to additional terms in the equation and the boundary condition containing a suitable Lagrange multiplier. A well-posedness result is proved for the related initial value problem.
