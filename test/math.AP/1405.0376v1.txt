We study the existence of Feller semigroups arising in the theory of multidimensional diffusion processes. We study bounded perturbations of elliptic operators with boundary conditions containing an integral over the closure of the domain with respect to a nonnegative Borel measure without assuming that the measure is small. We state sufficient conditions on the measure guaranteeing that the corresponding nonlocal operator is the generator of a Feller semigroup.
