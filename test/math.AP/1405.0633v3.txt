We show how a theorem about the solvability in W^{1,2}_{\infty} of special parabolic Isaacs equations can be used to obtain the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions of general uniformly nondegenerate parabolic Isaacs equations. We apply it also to establish the C^{1+\chi} regularity of viscosity solutions and show that finite-difference approximations have an algebraic rate of convergence. The main coefficients of the Isaacs equations are supposed to be in C^{\gamma} with respect to the spatial variables with \gamma slightly less than 1/2.
