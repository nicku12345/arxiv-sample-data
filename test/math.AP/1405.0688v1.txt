Let {X_j},{Y_j}(j = 1, \cdot \cdot \cdot,n) be vector fields satisfying H\"{o}rmander's condition and {\Delta_L} = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {(X_j^2 + Y_j^2)}. In this paper, we establish some inequalities of Dirichlet eigenvalues for degenerate elliptic partial differential operator {\Delta_L} and \Delta_L^2. These inequalities extend Yang's inequalities for Dirichlet eigenvalues of Laplacian to the settings here and the forms of inequalities are more general than Yang's inequalities. To obtain them, we give a generalization of the inequality by Chebyshev.
