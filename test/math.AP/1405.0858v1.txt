We prove the existence of the V-states for the generalized inviscid SQG equations with \alpha\in ]0,1[. These structures are special rotating simply connected patches with m- fold symmetry bifurcating from the trivial solution at some explicit values of the angular velocity. This produces, inter alia, an infinite family of non stationary global solutions with uniqueness.
