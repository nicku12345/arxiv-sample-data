We establish C^{\sigma+\alpha} interior estimates for concave nonlocal fully nonlinear equations of order \sigma\in(0,2) with rough kernels. Namely, we prove that if u\in C^{\alpha}(\mathbb R^n) solves in B_1 a concave translation invariant equation with kernels in \mathcal L_0(\sigma), then u belongs to C^{\sigma+\alpha}(\overline{ B_{1/2}}), with an estimate. More generally, our results allow the equation to depend on x in a C^\alpha fashion.   Our method of proof combines a Liouville theorem and a blow-up (compactness) procedure. Due to its flexibility, the same method can be useful in different regularity proofs for nonlocal equations.
