We consider two-dimensional solitary water waves on a shear flow with an arbitrary distribution of vorticity. Assuming that the horizontal velocity in the fluid never exceeds the wave speed and that the free surface lies everywhere above its asymptotic level, we give a very simple proof that a suitably defined Froude number F must be strictly greater than the critical value F=1. We also prove a related upper bound on F, and hence on the amplitude, under more restrictive assumptions on the vorticity.
