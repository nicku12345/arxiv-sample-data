This is a follow-up of a previous article where we proved local stability estimates for a potential in a Schr\"odinger equation on an open bounded set in dimension n=3 from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map with partial data. The region under control was the penumbra delimited by a source of light outside of the convex hull of the open set. These local estimates provided stability of log-log type corresponding to the uniqueness results in Calder\'on's inverse problem with partial data proved by Kenig, Sj\"ostrand and Uhlmann. In this article, we prove the corresponding global estimates in all dimensions higher than three. The estimates are based on the construction of solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation by complex geometrical optics developed in the anisotropic setting by Dos Santos Ferreira, Kenig, Salo and Uhlmann to solve the Calder\'on problem in certain admissible geometries.
