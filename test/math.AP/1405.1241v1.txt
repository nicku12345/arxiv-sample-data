This paper is devoted to the study of semi-stable radial solutions u\notin H^1(B_1) of -\Delta u=f(u) \mbox{in} \overline{B_1}\setminus \{0\}=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^N : 0<\vert x\vert\leq 1\}, where f\in C^1(\mathbb{R}) and N\geq 2. We establish sharp pointwise estimates for such solutions. In addition, we prove that in dimension N=2, any semi-stable radial weak solution of -\Delta u=f(u), posed in B_1 with Dirichlet data u|_{\partial B_1}=0, is regular.
