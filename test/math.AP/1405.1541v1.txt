We consider a Dirichlet problem for the Allen-Cahn equation in a smooth, bounded or unbounded, domain \Omega\subset {\bf R}^n. Under suitable assumptions, we prove an existence result and a uniform exponential estimate for symmetric solutions. In dimension n=2 an additional asymptotic result is obtained. These results are based on a pointwise estimate obtained for local minimizers of the Allen-Cahn energy.
