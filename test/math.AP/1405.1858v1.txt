We study the homogenization of elliptic systems of equations in divergence form where the coefficients are compositions of periodic functions with a random diffeomorphism with stationary gradient. This is done in the spirit of scalar stochastic homogenization by Blanc, Le Bris and P.-L. Lions. An application of the abstract result is given for Maxwell's equations in random dissipative bianisotropic media.
