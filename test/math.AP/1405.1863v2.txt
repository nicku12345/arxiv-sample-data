In this paper, we consider a complex fluid modeling nematic liquid crystal flows, which is described by a system coupling Navier-Stokes equations with a parabolic Q-tensor system. We first prove the global existence of weak solutions in dimension three. Furthermore, the global well-posedness of strong solutions is studied with sufficiently large viscosity of fluid. Finally, we show a continuous dependence result on the initial data which directly yields the weak-strong uniqueness of solutions.
