Short time existence for a surface diffusion evolution equation with curvature regularization is proved in the context of epitaxially strained three-dimensional films. This is achieved by implementing a minimizing movement scheme, which is hinged on the H^{-1}-gradient flow structure underpinning the evolution law. Long-time behavior and Liapunov stability in the case of initial data close to a flat configuration are also addressed.
