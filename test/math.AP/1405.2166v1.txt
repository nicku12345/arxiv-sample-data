We consider the critical heat equation \begin{equation} \label{CH}\tag{CH} \begin{array}{lr} v_t-\Delta v =|v|^{\frac{4}{n-2}}v & \Omega_{\epsilon}\times (0, +\infty) \\ v=0 & \partial\Omega_{\epsilon}\times (0, +\infty) \\ v=v_0 & \mbox{ in } \Omega_{\epsilon}\times \{t=0\} \end{array} \end{equation} in \Omega_{\epsilon}:=\Omega\setminus B_{\epsilon}(x_0) where \Omega is a smooth bounded domain in \mathbb R^N, N\geq 3 and B_{\epsilon}(x_0) is a ball of \mathbb R^N of center x_0\in\Omega and radius \epsilon >0 small. \\ We show that if \epsilon>0 is small enough, then there exists a sign-changing stationary solution \phi_{\epsilon} of \eqref{CH} such that the solution of \eqref{CH} with initial value v_0=\lambda \phi_{\epsilon} blows up in finite time if |\lambda -1|>0 is sufficiently small.\\ This shows in particular that the set of the initial conditions for which the solution of \eqref{CH} is global and bounded is not star-shaped.
