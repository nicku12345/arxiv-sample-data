We consider the semilinear Schr\"odinger equation      \left\{   \begin{array}{ll}   -\triangle u+V(x)u=f(x, u), \ \ \ \ x\in {\R}^{N},   u\in H^{1}({\R}^{N}),   \end{array}   \right.      where f is a superlinear, subcritical nonlinearity. We mainly study the case where V(x)=V_0(x)+V_1(x), V_0\in C(\mathbb{R}^N), V_0(x) is 1-periodic in each of x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N and \sup[\sigma(-\triangle +V_0)\cap (-\infty, 0)]<0<\inf[\sigma(-\triangle +V_0)\cap (0, \infty)], V_1\in C(\mathbb{R}^N) and \lim_{|x|\to\infty}V_1(x)=0. Inspired by previous work of Li et al. \cite{LWZ}, Pankov \cite{Pa} and Szulkin and Weth \cite{Sz}, we develop a more direct approach to generalize the main result in \cite{Sz} by removing the "strictly increasing" condition in the Nehari type assumption on f(x, t)/|t|. Unlike the Nahari manifold method, the main idea of our approach lies on finding a minimizing Cerami sequence for the energy functional outside the Nehari-Pankov manifold \mathcal{N}^{0} by using the diagonal method.
