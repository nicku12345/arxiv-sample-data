We address the well-posedness of the 2D (Euler)-Boussinesq equations with zero viscosity and positive diffusivity in the polygonal-like domains with Yudovich's type data, which gives a positive answer to part of the questions raised in 2011 [Lai-Pan-Zhao, Initial boundary value problem for two-dimensional viscous Boussinesq equations, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 199 (2011), no. 3, 739-760]. Our analysis on the the polygonal-like domains essentially relies on the recent elliptic regularity results for such domains proved in 2013 [Bardos-Plinio-Temam, The Euler equations in planar nonsmooth convex domains, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 407 (2013), no. 1, 69-89.] and [Plinio-Temam, Grisvard's shift theorem near l^\infty and yudovich theory on polygonal domains, arXiv:1310.5444]
