We investigate various boundary decay estimates for p(\cdot)-harmonic functions. For domains in \mathbb{R}^n, n\geq 2 satisfying the ball condition (C^{1,1}-domains) we show the boundary Harnack inequality for p(\cdot)-harmonic functions under the assumption that the variable exponent p is a bounded Lipschitz function. The proof involves barrier functions and chaining arguments.   Moreover, we prove a Carleson type estimate for p(\cdot)-harmonic functions in NTA domains in \mathbb{R}^n and provide lower- and upper- growth estimates and a doubling property for a p(\cdot)-harmonic measure.
