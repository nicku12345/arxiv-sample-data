The aim of this paper is to propose for the first time a reconstruction scheme and a stability result for recovering from acoustic-optic data absorption distributions with bounded variation. The paper extends earlier results on smooth absorption distributions. It opens a door for a mathematical and numerical framework for imaging, from internal data, parameter distributions with high contrast in biological tissues.
