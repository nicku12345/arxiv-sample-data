We considered classical solutions to the initial boundary value problem for non-isentropic compressible Euler equations with damping in multi-dimensions. We obtained global a priori estimates and global existence results of classical solutions to both non-isentropic Euler equations with damping and their nonlinear diffusion equations under small data assumption. We proved the pressure and velocity decay exponentially to constants, while the entropy and density can not approach constants. Finally, we proved the pressure and velocity of the non-isentropic Euler equations with damping converge exponentially to those of their nonlinear diffusion equations when the time goes to infinity.
