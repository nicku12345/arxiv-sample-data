We present local existence and uniqueness results for the following 2+1 dispersive diffusive equation due to P. Hall arising in modeling of river braiding: u_{yyt} - \gamma u_{xxx} -\alpha u_{yyyy} - \beta u_{yy} + \left (u^2 \right)_{xyy} = 0 for (x,y) \in [0, 2\pi] \times [0, \pi], t> 0, with boundary condition u_{y}=0=u_{yyy} at y=0 and y=\pi and 2\pi periodicity in x, using a contraction mapping argument in a Bourgain-type space T_{s,b}. We also show that the energy \| u \|^2_{L^2}  and cumulative dissipation \int_0^t \| u_y \|_{L^2}^2 dt are globally controlled in time.
