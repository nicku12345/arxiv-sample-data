In this paper we consider a smooth bounded domain \Omega \subset \R^N and a parametric family of radially symmetric kernels K_\epsilon: \R^N \to \R_+ such that, for each \epsilon \in (0,1), its L^1-norm is finite but it blows up as \epsilon \to 0. Our aim is to establish an \epsilon independent modulus of continuity in {\Omega}, for the solution u_\epsilon of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem \begin{equation*} \left \{ \begin{array}{rcll} - \I_\epsilon [u] \&=\& f \& \mbox{in} \ \Omega. \\ u \&=\& 0 \& \mbox{in} \ \Omega^c, \end{array} \right . \end{equation*} where f \in C(\bar{\Omega}) and the operator \I_\epsilon has the form \begin{equation*} \I_\epsilon[u](x) = \frac12\int \limits_{\R^N} [u(x + z) + u(x - z) - 2u(x)]K_\epsilon(z)dz \end{equation*} and it approaches the fractional Laplacian as \epsilon\to 0. The modulus of continuity is obtained combining the comparison principle with the translation invariance of \I_\epsilon, constructing suitable barriers that allow to manage the discontinuities that the solution u_\epsilon may have on \partial \Omega. Extensions of this result to fully non-linear elliptic and parabolic operators are also discussed.
