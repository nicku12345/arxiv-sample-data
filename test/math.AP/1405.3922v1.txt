We consider the inverse problem for the 2-dimensional weighted local Radon transform R_m[f], where f is supported in y\geq x^2 and R_m[f](\xi,\eta)=\int f(x, \xi x + \eta) m(\xi, \eta, x)\,\text{d} x is defined near (\xi,\eta)=(0,0). For weight functions satisfying a certain differential equation we give weak estimates of f in terms of R_m[f] for functions f that satisfies an a priori bound.
