The pointwise estimates of the deviations \widetilde{T}_{n,A,B}^{\text{}%}f\left(\cdot \right) -\widetilde{f}(\cdot) and \widetilde{T}_{n,A,B}^{% \text{}}f\left(\cdot \right) -\widetilde{f}(\cdot,\varepsilon) in terms of moduli of continuity \widetilde{\bar{w}}_{\cdot}f and \widetilde{w}%_{\cdot}f are proved. Analogical results on norm approximation with remarks and corollary are also given. These results generalized a theorem of Mittal.
