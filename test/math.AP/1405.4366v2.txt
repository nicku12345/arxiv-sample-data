Via a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we obtain multiple semiclassical solutions to a class of fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. Precisely, we consider \begin{equation*} \varepsilon^{2s}(-\Delta)^{s}u+u+V(x)u=|u|^{p-1}u,\quad u\in H^s(\mathbf R^n), \end{equation*} where 0<s<1, n>4-4s, 1<p<\frac{n+2s}{n-2s} (if n>2s) and 1<p<\infty (if n\le 2s), V(x) is a non-negative potential function. If V is a sufficiently smooth bounded function with a non-degenerate compact critical manifold M, then, when \varepsilon is sufficiently small, there exist at least l(M) semiclassical solutions, where l(M) is the cup length of M.
