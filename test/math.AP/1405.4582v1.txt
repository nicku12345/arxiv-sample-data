An electrical impedance spectroscopy-based nondestructive testing (NDT) method is proposed to image both cracks and reinforcing bars in concrete structures. The method utilizes the frequency-dependent behavior of thin insulating cracks: low-frequency electrical currents are blocked by insulating cracks, whereas high-frequency currents can pass through the conducting bars without being blocked by thin cracks. Rigorous mathematical analysis relates the geometric structures of the cracks and bars to the frequency-dependent Neumann-to-Dirichlet data. Various numerical simulations support the feasibility of the proposed method.
