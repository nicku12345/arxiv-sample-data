We study Liouville-type theorem for polyharmonic H\'enon-Lane-Emden system (-\Delta)^mu=|x|^av^p,\; (-\Delta)^mv=|x|^bu^q when m,p,q\geq 1, pq\ne 1, and a,b\geq 0. It is a natural conjecture that the nonexistence of positive solutions should be true if and only if (N+a)/(p+1)+ (N+b)/(q+1)>N-2m. It is shown by Fazly [6] that the conjecture holds for radial solutions in all dimensions and for classical solutions in dimension N\leq 2m+1. We here give some partial results in dimension N\geq 2m+2.
