In this paper, we consider suitable weak solutions of the four dimensional incompressible magneto-hydrodynamic equations. We give two different kind \varepsilon-regularity criteria. One only requires the smallness of scaling L^{p,q} norm of u, another requires the smallness of scaling space time L^2 norm of \nabla u and boundedness of scaling norm of H or \nabla H. And as an application of the second kind criteria, we also prove that up to the boundary, the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the set of singular points is equal to zero.
