We prove the C^{1} regularity and developability of W^{2,p} isometric immersions of n-dimensional flat domains into {\mathbb R}^{n+k} where p\ge \min\{2k, n\}. Another parallel consequence of our methods is a similar regularity and rigidity result for the W^{2,n} solutions of the degenerate Monge-Amp\`ere equations in n dimensions. The analysis also applies to the situations when the degeneracy is extended to (k+1)\times (k+1) minors of the Hessian matrix and the solution is W^{2,p}, with p\ge \min\{2k, n\}.
