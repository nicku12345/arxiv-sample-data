In this paper, we address the space-time decay properties for strong solutions to the incompressible viscous resistive Hall-MHD equations. We obtained the same space-time decay rates as those of the heat equation. Based on the temporal decay results in \cite{cs}, we find that one can obtain weighted estimates of the magnetic field B by direct weighted energy estimate, and then by regarding the magnetic convection term as a forcing term in the velocity equations, we can obtain the weighted estimates for the vorticity, which yields the corresponding estimates for the velocity field. The higher order derivative estimates will be obtained by using a parabolic interpolation inequality proved in \cite{k01}. It should be emphasized that the the magnetic field has stronger decay properties than the velocity field in the sense that there is no restriction on the exponent of the weight. The same arguments also yield the sharp space-time decay rates for strong solutions to the usual MHD equations.
