We show that the incompressible Euler equations on \mathbb{R}^2 are not locally well-posed in the sense of Hadamard in the Besov space B^1_{\infty,1}. Our approach relies on the technique of Lagrangian deformations of Bourgain and Li. We show that the assumption that the data-to-solution map is continuous in B^1_{\infty,1} leads to a contradiction with a well-posedness result in W^{1,p} of Kato and Ponce.
