In this paper, the regularity results for the integro-differential operators of the fractional Laplacian type by Caffarelli and Silvestre \cite{CS1} are extended to those for the integro-differential operators associated with symmetric, regularly varying kernels at zero. In particular, we obtain the uniform Harnack inequality and H\"older estimate of viscosity solutions to the nonlinear integro-differential equations associated with the kernels K_{\sigma, \beta} satisfying    K_{\sigma,\beta}(y)\asymp \frac{ 2-\sigma}{|y|^{n+\sigma}}\left( \log\frac{2}{|y|^2}\right)^{\beta(2-\sigma)}\quad \mbox{near zero}  with respect to \sigma\in(0,2) close to 2 (for a given \beta\in\mathbb R), where the regularity estimates do not blow up   as the order  \sigma\in(0,2) tends to 2.
