We prove L^p-parabolic a-priori estimates for \partial_t u + \sum_{i,j=1}^d c_{ij}(t)\partial_{x_i x_j}^2 u = f  on R^{d+1} when the coefficients c_{ij} are locally bounded functions on R. We slightly generalize the usual parabolicity assumption and show that still L^p-estimates hold for the second spatial derivatives of u. We also investigate the dependence of the constant appearing in such estimates from the parabolicity constant. Finally we extend our estimates to parabolic equations involving non-degenerate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators.
