In this paper, we build a Gibbs measure for the cubic defocusing Schr\"odinger equation on the real line with a decreasing interaction potential, in the sense that the non linearity |u|^2u is multiplied by a function \chi which we assume integrable and smooth enough. We prove that this equation is globally well-posed in the support of this measure and that the measure is invariant under the flow of the equation. What is more, the support of the measure (the set of initial data) is disjoint from L^2.
