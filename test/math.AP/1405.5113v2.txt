We study the time asymptotic propagation of solutions to the reaction-diffusion cooperative systems with fractional diffusion. We prove that the propagation speed is exponential in time, and we find the precise exponent of propagation. This exponent depends on the smallest index of the fractional laplacians and on the principal eigenvalue of the matrix DF(0) where F is the reaction term. We also note that this speed does not depend on the space direction.
