We show that a realization of the operator L=|x|^\alpha\Delta +c|x|^{\alpha-1}\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot\nabla -b|x|^{\alpha-2} generates a semigroup in L^p(\mathbb {R}^N) if and only if D_c=b+(N-2+c)^2/4 > 0 and s_1+\min\{0,2-\alpha\}<N/p<s_2+\max\{0,2-\alpha\}, where s_i are the roots of the equation b+s(N-2+c-s)=0, or D_c=0 and s_0+\min\{0,2-\alpha\} \le N/p \le s_0+\max\{0,2-\alpha\}, where s_0 is the unique root of the above equation. The domain of the generator is also characterized.
