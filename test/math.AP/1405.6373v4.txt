In this paper we first obtain a constant rank theorem for the second fundamental form of the space-time level sets of a space-time quasiconcave solution of the heat equation. Utilizing this constant rank theorem, we can obtain some strictly convexity results of the spatial and space-time level sets of the space-time quasiconcave solution of the heat equation in a convex ring. To explain our ideas and for completeness, we also review the constant rank theorem technique for the space-time Hessian of space-time convex solution of heat equation and for the second fundamental form of the convex level sets for harmonic function.
