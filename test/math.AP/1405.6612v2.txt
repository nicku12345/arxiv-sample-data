We prove H\"older estimates for viscosity solutions of a class of possibly degenerate and singular equations modelled by the fractional p-Laplace equation  \text{PV} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(x)-u(x+y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(x+y))}{|y|^{n+sp}}\, dy =0,  where s\in (0,1) and p>2 or 1/(1-s)<p<2. Our results also apply for inhomogeneous equations with more general kernels, when p and s are allowed to vary with x, without any regularity assumption on p and s. This complements and extends some of the recently obtained H\"older estimates for weak solutions.
