In this paper, the fully parabolic Keller-Segel system \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{llc} u_t=\Delta u-\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v), &(x,t)\in \Omega\times (0,T),\\ v_t=\Delta v-v+u, &(x,t)\in\Omega\times (0,T),\\ \end{array} \right.   \qquad \qquad (\star) \end{equation} is considered under Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n with smooth boundary, where n\ge 2. We derive a smallness condition on the initial data in optimal Lebesgue spaces which ensure global boundedness and large time convergence. More precisely, we shall show that one can find \varepsilon_0>0 such that for all suitably regular initial data (u_0,v_0) satisfying \|u_0\|_{L^{\frac{n}{2}}(\Omega)}<\varepsilon_0 and \|\nabla v_0\|_{L^{n}(\Omega)}<\varepsilon_0, the above problem possesses a global classical solution which is bounded and approaches the constant steady state (m,m) with m:=\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega} u_0. Our approach allows us to furthermore study a general chemotaxis system with rotational sensitivity in dimension 2, which is lacking the natural energy structure associated with (\star). For such systems, we prove a global existence and boundedness result under corresponding smallness conditions on the initially present total mass of cells and the chemical gradient.
