We obtain a cohesive fracture model as a \Gamma-limit of scalar damage models in which the elastic coefficient is computed from the damage variable v through a function f_k of the form f_k(v)=min\{1,\varepsilon_k^{1/2} f(v)\}, with f diverging for v close to the value describing undamaged material. The resulting fracture energy can be determined by solving a one-dimensional vectorial optimal profile problem. It is linear in the opening s at small values of s and has a finite limit as s\to\infty. If the function f is allowed to depend on the index k, for specific choices we recover in the limit Dugdale's and Griffith's fracture models, and models with surface energy density having a power-law growth at small openings.
