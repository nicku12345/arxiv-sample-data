We consider the Cauchy problem of the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on \mathbb R^d, d \geq 3, with random initial data and prove almost sure well-posedness results below the scaling critical regularity s_\text{crit} = \frac{d-2}{2}. More precisely, given a function on \mathbb R^d, we introduce a randomization adapted to the Wiener decomposition, and, intrinsically, to the so-called modulation spaces. Our goal in this paper is three-fold. (i) We prove almost sure local well-posedness of the cubic NLS below the scaling critical regularity along with small data global existence and scattering. (ii) We implement a probabilistic perturbation argument and prove `conditional' almost sure global well-posedness for d = 4 in the defocusing case, assuming an a priori energy bound on the critical Sobolev norm of the nonlinear part of a solution; when d \ne 4, we show that conditional almost sure global well-posedness in the defocusing case also holds under an additional assumption of global well-posedness of solutions to the defocusing cubic NLS with deterministic initial data in the critical Sobolev regularity. (iii) Lastly, we prove global well-posedness and scattering with a large probability for initial data randomized on dilated cubes.
