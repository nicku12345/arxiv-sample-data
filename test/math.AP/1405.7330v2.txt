We consider the Cauchy problem of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) with almost periodic functions as initial data. We first prove that, given a frequency set \pmb{\omega} =\{\omega_j\}_{j = 1}^\infty, NLS is local well-posed in the algebra \mathcal{A}_{\pmb{\omega}}(\mathbb R) of almost periodic functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series. Then, we prove a finite time blowup result for NLS with a nonlinearity |u|^p, p \in 2\mathbb{N}. This elementary argument presents the first instance of finite time blowup solutions to NLS with generic almost periodic initial data.
