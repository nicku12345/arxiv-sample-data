This paper deals with numerical methods for reconstruction of inhomogeneous conductivities. We use the concept of Generalized Polarization Tensors, which were introduced in [3], to do reconstruction. Basic resolution and stability analysis are presented. Least square norm methods with respect to Generalized Polarization Tensors are used for reconstruction of conductivities. Finally, reconstruction of three different types of conductivities in the plane is demonstrated.
