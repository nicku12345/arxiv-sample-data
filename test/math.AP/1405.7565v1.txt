We address the study of decay rates of solutions to dissipative equations. The characterization of these rates is given for a wide class of linear systems by the {\em decay character}, which is a number associated to the initial datum that describes the behavior of the datum near the origin in frequency space. We then use the decay character and the Fourier Splitting method to obtain upper and lower bounds for decay of solutions to appropriate dissipative nonlinear equations, both in the incompressible and compressible case.
