We consider active scalar equations \partial_t \theta + \nabla \cdot (u \, \theta) = 0, where u = T[\theta] is a divergence-free velocity field, and T is a Fourier multiplier operator with symbol m. We prove that when m is not an odd function of frequency, there are nontrivial, compactly supported solutions weak solutions, with H\"older regularity C^{1/9-}_{t,x}. In fact, every integral conserving scalar field can be approximated in {\cal D}' by such solutions, and these weak solutions may be obtained from arbitrary initial data. We also show that when the multiplier m is odd, weak limits of solutions are solutions, so that the h-principle for odd active scalars may not be expected.
