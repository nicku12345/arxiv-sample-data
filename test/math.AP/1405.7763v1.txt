This article is concerned with a mutualism ecological model with stochastic perturbations. the local existence and uniqueness of a positive solution are obtained with positive initial value, and the asymptotic behavior to the problem is studied. Moreover, we show that the solution is stochastically bounded, uniformly continuous and stochastic permanence. The sufficient conditions for the system to be extinct are given and the condition for the system to be persistent are also established. At last, some figures are presented to illustrate our main results.
