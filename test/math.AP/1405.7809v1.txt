Nonlocal conservation laws are used to describe various realistic instances of crowd behaviors. First, a basic analytic framework is established through an "ad hoc" well posedness theorem for systems of nonlocal conservation laws in several space dimensions interacting non locally with a system of ODEs. Numerical integrations show possible applications to the interaction of different groups of pedestrians, and also with other "agents".
