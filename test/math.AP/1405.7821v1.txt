We demonstrate the oscillatory decay of the survival probability of the stochastic dynamics d\x_\eps=\mb{a}(\x_\eps)\, dt +\sqrt{2\eps}\,\mb{b}(\x_\eps)\,d\w, which is activated by small noise over the boundary of the domain of attraction D of a stable focus of the drift \mb{a}(\x). The boundary \p D of the domain is an unstable limit cycle of \mb{a}(\x). The oscillations are explained by a singular perturbation expansion of the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem for the non-self adjoint Fokker-Planck operator in D \[L_\eps u(\x)=\,\eps\sum_{i,j=1}^2 \frac{\p ^2\left[ \sigma ^{i,j}\left(\x\right) u(\x) \right]}{\p x^i\p x^j}-\sum_{i=1}^2\frac {\p \left[ a^i\left(\x\right) u(\x)\right]} {\p x^i} =-\lambda_\eps u(\x),\] with \mb{\sigma}(\x)=\mb{b}(\x)\mb{b}^T(\x). We calculate the leading-order asymptotic expansion of all eigenvalues \lambda_\eps for small \eps. The principal eigenvalue is known to decay exponentially fast as \eps\to0. We find that for small \eps the higher-order eigenvalues are given by \lambda_{m,n}=n\omega_1+mi\omega_2+O(\eps) for n=1,2,\ldots,\,m=\pm1,\ldots, where \omega_1 and \omega_2 are explicitly computed constants. We also find the asymptotic structure of the eigenfunctions of L_\eps and of its adjoint L^*_\eps. We illustrate the oscillatory decay with a model of synaptic depression of neuronal network in neurobiology.
