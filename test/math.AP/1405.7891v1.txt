In this note, using the ideas from our recent article \cite{EM}, we prove strong ill-posedness for the 2D Euler equations in C^k spaces. This note provides a significantly shorter proof of many of the main results in \cite{BLi2}. In the case k>1 we show the existence of initial data for which the kth derivative of the velocity field develops a logarithmic singularity immediately. The strong ill-posedness covers C^{k-1,1} spaces as well. The ill-posedness comes from the pressure term in the Euler equation. We formulate the equation for D^k u as:   \partial_t D^k u=D^{k+1} p + l.o.t.   and then use the non-locality of the map u\rightarrow p to get the ill-posedness. The real difficulty comes in how to deal with the "l.o.t." terms which can be handled by special commutator estimates.
