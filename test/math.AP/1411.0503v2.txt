We obtain the local well-posedness of the one dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation for initial data in the modulation space M_{2, p} for all 2\le p<\infty, which covers all the subcritical cases from the viewpoint of scaling. Moreover, in order to approach the endpoint space M_{2,\infty}, we will prove the almost global well-posedness in some Orlicz-type space, which is a natural generalisation of M_{2,p} for large p. The new ingredient is an endpoint version of the two dimensional restriction estimate.
