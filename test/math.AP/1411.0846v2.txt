We prove global well-posedness, scattering and blow-up results for energy-subcritical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the hyperbolic space. We show in particular the existence of a critical element for scattering for all energy-subcritical power nonlinearities. For mass-supercritical nonlinearity, we show a scattering vs blow-up dichotomy for radial solutions of the equation in low dimension, below natural mass and energy thresholds given by the ground states of the equation. The proofs are based on trapping by mass and energy, compactness and rigidity, and are similar to the ones on the Euclidean space, with a new argument, based on generalized Pohozaev identities, to obtain appropriate monotonicity formulas.
