We study nonnegative solutions of the boundary value problem -\Delta u = \lambda c(x)u + \mu(x)|\nabla u|^2 + h(x),\quad   u\in H^1_0(\Omega)\cap L^\infty(\Omega),   \leqno(P_\lambda) where \Omega is a smooth bounded domain,   \mu, c\in L^\infty(\Omega), h\in L^r(\Omega) for some r > n/2 and \mu,c,h > {\hskip -3.5mm} {\atop \neq} 0. Our main motivation is to study the "noncoercive" case. Namely, unlike in previous work on the subject, we do not assume \mu to be positive everywhere in \Omega.   In space dimensions up to n=5, we establish uniform a priori estimates for weak solutions of (P_\lambda) when \lambda>0 is bounded away from 0. This is proved under the assumption that the supports of \mu and c intersect, a condition that we show to be actually necessary, and in some cases we further assume that \mu is uniformly positive on the support of c and/or some other conditions.   As a consequence of our a priori estimates, assuming that (P_0) has a solution, we deduce the existence of a continuum {\cal C} of solutions, such that the projection of {\cal C} onto the \lambda-axis is an interval of the form [0,a] for some a>0 and that the continuum {\cal C} bifurcates from infinity to the right of the axis \lambda=0. In particular, for each \lambda>0 small enough, problem (P_\lambda) has at least two distinct solutions.
