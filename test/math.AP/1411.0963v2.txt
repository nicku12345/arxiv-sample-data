We obtain a decay estimate for solutions to the linear dispersive equation iu_t-(-\Delta)^{1/4}u=0 for (t,x)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}. This corresponds to a factorization of the linearized water wave equation u_{tt}+(-\Delta)^{1/2}u=0. In particular, by making use of the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and stationary phase estimates, we obtain decay of order |t|^{-1/2} for solutions corresponding to data u(0)=\varphi, assuming only bounds on \lVert \varphi\rVert_{H_x^1(\mathbb{R})} and \lVert x\partial_x\varphi\rVert_{L_x^2(\mathbb{R})}. As another application of these ideas, we give an extension to equations of the form iu_t-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u=0 for a wider range of \alpha.
