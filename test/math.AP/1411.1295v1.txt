In this work we establish the well-posedness for infinitesimal dislocation based gradient viscoplasticity with isotropic hardening for general gradient monotone plastic flows. We assume an additive split of the displacement gradient into non-symmetric elastic distortion and non-symmetric plastic distortion. The thermodynamic potential is augmented with a term taking the dislocation density tensor \operatorname{Curl} p into account. The constitutive equations in the models we study are assumed to be of self-controlling type. Based on the generalized version of Korn's inequality for incompatible tensor fields (the non-symmetric plastic distortion) due to Neff/Pauly/Witsch the existence of solutions of quasi-static initial-boundary value problems under consideration is shown using a time-discretization technique and a monotone operator method.
