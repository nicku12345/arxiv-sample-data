This paper examines the global regularity problem on the two-dimensional incompressible Boussinesq equations with fractional dissipation, given by \Lambda^\alpha u in the velocity equation and by \Lambda^\beta \theta in the temperature equation, where \Lambda=\sqrt{-\Delta} denotes the Zygmund operator. We establish the global existence and smoothness of classical solutions when (\alpha,\beta) is in the critical range: \alpha>\frac{\sqrt{1777}-23}{24} =0.798103.., \beta>0 and \alpha+ \beta =1. This result improves the previous work of Jiu, Miao, Wu and Zhang \cite{JMWZ} which obtained the global regularity for \alpha> \frac{23-\sqrt{145}}{12} \approx 0.9132, \beta>0 and \alpha+ \beta =1.
