In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system  \left \{ \begin{array}{l} -\Delta u=\sqrt{p}u^{p-1}v, \quad u>0 \quad in \quad R^n, -\Delta v=\sqrt{p}u^p, \quad v>0 \quad in \quad R^n \end{array} \right.  with n \geq 3 and p>1. We investigate the existence and the nonexistence of positive classical solutions with the help of an integral system involving the Newton potential  \left \{ \begin{array}{l} u(x)=c_1\displaystyle\int_{R^n}\frac{u^{p-1}(y)v(y)dy}{|x-y|^{n-2}}, \quad u>0 \quad in \quad R^n, v(x)=c_2\displaystyle\int_{R^n}\frac{u^p(y)dy}{|x-y|^{n-2}} \quad v>0 \quad in \quad R^n. \end{array} \right.  First, the system has no solution when p\leq \frac{n}{n-2}. When p>\frac{n}{n-2}, the system has a singular solution on R^n \setminus \{0\} with slow asymptotic rate \frac{2}{p-1}. When p<\frac{n+2}{n-2}, the system has no solution in L^{\frac{n(p-1)}{2}}(R^n). In fact, if the system has solutions in L^{\frac{n(p-1)}{2}}(R^n), then p=\frac{n+2}{n-2} and all the positive classical solutions can be classified as u(x)=v(x)=c(\frac{t}{t^2+|x-x^*|^2})^{\frac{n-2}{2}}, where c,t are positive constants. When p>\frac{n+2}{n-2}, by the shooting method and the Pohozaev identity, we find another pair of radial solution (u,v) satisfying u \equiv v and decaying with slow rate \frac{2}{p-1}.
