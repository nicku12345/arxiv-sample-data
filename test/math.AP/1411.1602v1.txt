We show the existence of self-similar solutions with fat tails for Smoluchowski's coagulation equation for homogeneous kernels satisfying C_1 \left(x^{-a}y^{b}+x^{b}y^{-a}\right)\leq K\left(x,y\right)\leq C_2\left(x^{-a}y^{b}+x^{b}y^{-a}\right) with a>0 and b<1. This covers especially the case of Smoluchowski's classical kernel K(x,y)=(x^{1/3} + y^{1/3})(x^{-1/3} + y^{-1/3}).   For the proof of existence we first consider some regularized kernel K_{\epsilon} for which we construct a sequence of solutions h_{\epsilon}. In a second step we pass to the limit \epsilon\to 0 to obtain a solution for the original kernel K. The main difficulty is to establish a uniform lower bound on h_{\epsilon}. The basic idea for this is to consider the time-dependent problem and choosing a special test function that solves the dual problem.
