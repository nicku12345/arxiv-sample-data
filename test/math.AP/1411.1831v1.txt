In this paper we study the optimality condition for the Venttsel boundary control of a parabolic equation, that is, the state of the dynamic system is governed by a parabolic equation together with an initial condition while the control is applied to the system via the Venttsel boundary condition. A first order necessary condition is derived for the optimal solution in the case of both unconstrained and constrained problems. The condition is also sufficient for the unconstrained problem.
