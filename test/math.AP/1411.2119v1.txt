In this paper well-posedness is proved for an initial and boundary value problem (IBVP) relative to a large class of quasilinear hyperbolic systems, in p+q equations, on a strip, arising from a model of H_2O-phase transitions in the atmosphere. To obtain this result, first, we extensively study an IBVP for the generic linear transport equation on S_{t_1 } = (0,t_1 ) \times G with uniformly locally Lipschitz data and associated vector field in L_{x_d }^{-} (S_{t_1 } \times \mathbb{R}^p ) (this cone of L_t^\infty (0,t_1 ;L_{(x,y_{loc} )}^\infty (G \times \mathbb{R}^p ))^d  is not cointained in W^{1,\infty }_{\left( {t,x,y_{loc} } \right)} \left( {S_{t_1} \times \mathbb{R}^p} \right)^d), that involves parametric vector functions in  L^\infty \left( {0,t_1;W^{1,\infty } \left( G \right)} \right)^p, by the method of characteristics. We obtain that the solution belongs to W_{(t,x,y_{loc} )}^{1,\infty } (S_{t_1 } \times \mathbb{R}^p ) and interesting estimates about it.   Afterwards, using fixed point arguments, we establish the local existence, in time, and uniqueness of the solution in W^{1,\infty } \left( {S_{t^* } } \right)^{p+q} for our class of quasilinear hyperbolic systems. Finally, we apply this result to study an IBVP for the hyperbolic part of an atmospheric model on the transition of water in the three states, introduced in \cite{[SF]}, such that rain and ice fall from it.
