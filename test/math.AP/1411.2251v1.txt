Nowadays, traffic monitoring systems have access to real time data, e.g. through GPS devices. We propose a new traffic model able to take into account these data and, hence, able to describe the effects of unpredictable accidents. The well posedness of this model is proved and numerical integrations show qualitative features of the resulting solutions. As a further motivation for the use of real time data, we show that the inverse problem for the Lighthill-Whitam and Richards (LWR) model is ill posed.
