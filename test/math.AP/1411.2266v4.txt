In this paper, we establish a new uniqueness result of a (continuous) viscosity solution for some integro-partial differential equation (IPDE in short).   The novelty is that we relax the so-called monotonicity assumption on the driver, assumption which is classically assumed in the literature of viscosity solution of equation with a non local term.   Our method strongly relies on the link between IPDEs and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs in short) with jumps for which we already know that the solution exists and is unique. In the second part of the paper, we deal with the IPDE with obstacle and we obtain similar results.
