By a new orthogonal direct sum decomposition E_{M} = Y \oplus Z, which Z is related to \Delta u_i(i=1,2,3,....,M), and a new functional I(u), the method in [2] is improved to obtain new multiple periodic solutions with negativity hypothesis on F for a second-order discrete Hamiltonian system. Moreover, we exhibit an instructive example to make our result more clear, which hasn't been solved by the known results.
