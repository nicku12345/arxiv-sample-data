We extend and survey results in the theory of analysis on fractal sets from the standard Laplacian on the Sierpi\'nski gasket to the energy Laplacian, which is defined weakly by using the Kusuoka energy measure. We also extend results from the Sierpi\'nski gasket to level-k Sierpi\'nski gaskets, for all k\geq 2. We observe that the pointwise formula for the energy Laplacian is valid for all level-k Sierpi\'nski gaskets, SG_k, and we provide a proof of a known formula for the renormalization constants of the Dirichlet form for post-critically finite self-similar sets along with a probabilistic interpretation of the Laplacian pointwise formula. We also provide a vector self-similar formula and a variable weight self-similar formula for the Kusuoka measure on SG_k, as well as a formula for the scaling of the energy Laplacian.
