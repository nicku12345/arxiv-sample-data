We study strong instability (instability by blowup) of standing wave solutions for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an attractive delta potential and L^2-supercritical power nonlinearity in one space dimension. We also compare our sufficient condition on strong instability with some known results on orbital instability.
