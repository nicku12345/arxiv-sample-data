We study a system of two coupled nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations, where one equation includes gain and the other one includes losses. Strengths of the gain and the loss are equal, i.e., the resulting system is parity-time ({\cal PT}) symmetric. The model includes both linear and nonlinear couplings, such that when all nonlinear coefficients are equal, the system represents the {\cal PT}-generalization of the Manakov model. In the one-dimensional case, we prove the existence of a global solution to the Cauchy problem in energy space H^1, such that the H^1-norm of the global solution may grow in time. In the Manakov case, we show analytically that the L^2-norm of the global solution is bounded for all times and numerically that the H^1-norm is also bounded. In the two-dimensional case, we obtain a constraint on the L^2-norm of the initial data that ensures the existence of a global solution in the energy space H^1.
