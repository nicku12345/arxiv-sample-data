Let X be a locally compact abelian group with countable base and let \mathcal W be a convex cone of positive numerical functions on X which is invariant under the group action and such that (X,\mathcal W) is a balayage space or (equivalently, if 1\in \mathcal W) such that \mathcal W is the set of excessive functions of a Hunt process on X, \mathcal W separates points, every function in \mathcal W is the supremum of its continuous minorants in \mathcal W, and there exist strictly positive continuous u,v\in \mathcal W such that u/v\to 0 at infinity.   Assuming that there is a Green function G>0 for X which locally satisfies the triangle inequality G(x,z)\wedge G(y,z)\le C G(x,y) (true for many L\'evy processes), it is shown that Hunt's hypothesis (H) holds, that is, every semipolar set is polar.
