In this paper, we study an inhomogeneous variant of the normalized p-Laplacian evolution which has been recently treated in \cite{BG1}, \cite{Do}, \cite{MPR} and \cite{Ju}. We show that if the initial datum satisfies the pointwise gradient estimate \eqref{e:main1} a.e., then the unique solution to the Cauchy problem \eqref{main5} satisfies the same gradient estimate a.e. for all later times, see \eqref{e:main} below. A general pointwise gradient bound for the entire bounded solutions of the elliptic counterpart of equation \eqref{main5} was first obtained in \cite{CGS}. Such estimate generalizes one obtained by L. Modica for the Laplacian, and it has connections to a famous conjecture of De Giorgi.
