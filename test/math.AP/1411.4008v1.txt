We present a systematic study of entire symmetric solutions u:R^n\rightarrow R^m of the vector Allen-Cahn equation \Delta u-W_u(u)=0, x \in R^n, where W:R^m\rightarrow R is smooth, symmetric, nonnegative with a finite number of zeros and W_u=(\frac{\partial W}{\partial u_1},\ldots,\frac{\partial W}{\partial u_m})^\top. We introduce a general notion of equivariance with respect to a homomorphism f:G\rightarrow\Gamma (G,\Gamma reflection groups) and prove two abstract results, concerning the cases of G finite and G discrete, for the existence of equivariant solutions. Our approach is variational and based on a mapping property of the parabolic vector Allen-Cahn equation and on a pointwise estimate for vector minimizers.
