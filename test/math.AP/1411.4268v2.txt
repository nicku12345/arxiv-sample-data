We study a counterpart of the classical Poisson integral for a family of weighted Laplace differential equations in Euclidean half space, solutions of which are known as generalized axially symmetric potentials. These potentials appear naturally in the study of hyperbolic Brownian motion with drift. We determine the optimal class of tempered distributions which by means of the so-called \mathscr{S}'-convolution can be extended to generalized axially symmetric potentials. In the process, the associated Dirichlet boundary value problem is solved, and we obtain sharp order relations for the asymptotic growth of these extensions.
