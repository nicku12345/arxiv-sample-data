The Hardy-Sobolev trace inequality can be obtained via Harmonic extensions on the half-space of the Stein and Weiss weighted Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. In this paper we consider a bounded domain and study the influence of the boundary mean curvature in the Hardy-Sobolev trace inequality on the underlying domain. We prove existence of minimizers when the mean curvature is negative at the singular point of the Hardy potential.
