We study the magnetic energy of magnetic polymer composite materials as the average distance between magnetic particles vanishes. We model the position of these particles in the polymeric matrix as a stochastic lattice scaled by a small parameter \varepsilon and the magnets as classical \pm 1 spin variables interacting via an Ising type energy. Under surface scaling of the energy we prove, in terms of \Gamma-convergence that, up to subsequences, the (continuum) \Gamma-limit of these energies is finite on the set of Caccioppoli partitions representing the magnetic Weiss domains where it has a local integral structure. Assuming stationarity of the stochastic lattice, we can make use of ergodic theory to further show that the \Gamma-limit exists and that the integrand is given by an asymptotic homogenization formula which becomes deterministic if the lattice is ergodic.
