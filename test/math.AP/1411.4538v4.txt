We analyze upwind difference methods for strongly degenerate convection-diffusion equations in several spatial dimensions. We prove that the local L^1-error between the exact and numerical solutions is \mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{2/(19+d)}), where d is the spatial dimension and \Delta x is the grid size. The error estimate is robust with respect to vanishing diffusion effects. The proof makes effective use of specific kinetic formulations of the difference method and the convection-diffusion equation.
