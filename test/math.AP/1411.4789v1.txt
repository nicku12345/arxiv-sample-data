We discuss stability of square root domains for uniformly elliptic partial differential operators L_{a,\Omega,\Gamma} = -\nabla\cdot a \nabla in L^2(\Omega), with mixed boundary conditions on \partial \Omega, with respect to additive perturbations. We consider open, bounded, and connected sets \Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n, n \in \mathbb{N} \backslash\{1\}, that satisfy the interior corkscrew condition and prove stability of square root domains of the operator L_{a,\Omega,\Gamma} with respect to additive potential perturbations V \in L^p(\Omega) + L^{\infty}(\Omega), p>n/2.   Special emphasis is put on the case of uniformly elliptic systems with mixed boundary conditions.
