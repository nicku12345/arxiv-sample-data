We characterize the range of the attenuated and non-attenuated X-ray transform of compactly supported vector fields in the plane. The characterization is in terms of a Hilbert transform associated with the A-analytic functions \`{a} la Bukhgeim. As an application we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the attenuated Doppler and X-ray data to be mistaken for each other.
