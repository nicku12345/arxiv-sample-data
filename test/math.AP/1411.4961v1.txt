It is established the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions for a class of nonlocal equations involving the fractional laplacian, nonlinearities with critical exponential growth and potentials this is which may change sign. The proofs of our existence results rely on minimization methods in combination with the mountain-pass theorem.
