We consider a space-inhomogeneous Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov (KPP) equation with a nonlocal diffusion and an almost-periodic nonlinearity. By employing and adapting the theory of homogenization, we show that solutions of this equation asymptotically converge to its stationary states in regions of space separated by a front that is determined by a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality.
