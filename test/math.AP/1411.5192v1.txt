We study the existence and non-existence of positive solutions for the (p,q)-Laplace equation -\Delta_p u -\Delta_q u = \alpha |u|^{p-2} u + \beta |u|^{q-2} u, where p \neq q, under the zero Dirichlet boundary condition in \Omega. The main result of our research is the construction of a continuous curve in (\alpha,\beta) plane, which becomes a threshold between the existence and non-existence of positive solutions. Furthermore, we provide the example of domains \Omega for which the corresponding first Dirichlet eigenvalue of -\Delta_p is not monotone w.r.t. p > 1.
