We give a regularity criterion for a Q-tensor system modeling a nematic Liquid Crystal, under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the tensor Q. Starting of a criterion only imposed on the velocity field {\bf u} two results are proved; the uniqueness of weak solutions and the global in time weak regularity for the time derivative (\partial_t {\bf u},\partial_t Q). This paper extends the work done in [F. Guill\'en-Gonz\'alez, M.A. Rodr\'iguez-Bellido \& M.A. Rojas-Medar, Sufficient conditions for regularity and uniqueness of a 3D nematic liquid crystal model, Math. Nachr. 282 (2009), no. 6, 846-867] for a nematic Liquid Crystal model formulated in ({\bf u},{\bf d}), where {\bf d} denotes the orientation vector of the liquid crystal molecules.
