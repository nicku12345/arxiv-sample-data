In the present paper, we consider the initial value problem for the bipolar Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann (bVPB) system and its corresponding modified Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann (mVPB). We give the spectrum analysis on the linearized bVPB and mVPB systems around their equilibrium state and show the optimal convergence rate of global solutions. It was showed that the electric field decays exponentially and the distribution function tends to the absolute Maxwellian at the optimal convergence rate (1+t)^{-3/4} for the bVPB system, yet both the electric field and the distribution function converge to equilibrium state at the optimal rate (1+t)^{-3/4} for the mVPB system.
