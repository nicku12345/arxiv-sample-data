In this paper we give a new formulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes by introducing an suitable effective velocity v=u+\n\va(\rho) provided that the viscosity coefficients verify the algebraic relation of \cite{BD}. We give in particular a very simple proof of the entropy discovered in \cite{BD}, in addition our argument show why the algebraic relation of \cite{BD} appears naturally. More precisely the system reads in a very surprising way as two parabolic equation on the density \rho and the vorticity {\rm curl}v, and as a transport equation on the divergence {\rm div}v. We show the existence of strong solution with large initial data in finite time when (\rho_0-1)\in B^{\NN}_{p,1}. A remarkable feature of this solution is the regularizing effects on the density. We extend this result to the case of global strong solution with small initial data.
