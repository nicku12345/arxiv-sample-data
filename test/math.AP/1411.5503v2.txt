We consider Navier-Stokes equations for compressible viscous fluids in one dimension. We prove the existence of global strong solution with large initial data for the shallow water system. The key ingredient of the proof relies to a new formulation of the compressible equations involving a new effective velocity v (see \cite{cras,para,CPAM,CPAM1}) such that the density verifies a parabolic equation. We estimate v in L^\infty norm which enables us to control the vacuum on the density.
