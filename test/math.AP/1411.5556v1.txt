The paper concerns the general linear one-dimensional second-order hyperbolic equation  \partial^2_tu - a^2(x,t)\partial^2_xu + a_1(x,t)\partial_tu + a_2(x,t)\partial_xu + a_3(x,t)u=f(x,t), \quad x\in(0,1)  with periodic conditions in time and Robin boundary conditions in space. Under a non-resonance condition (formulated in terms of the coefficients a, a_1, and a_2) ruling out the small divisors effect, we prove the Fredholm alternative. Moreover, we show that the solutions have higher regularity if the data have higher regularity and if additional non-resonance conditions are fulfilled. Finally, we state a result about smooth dependence on the data, where perturbations of the coefficient a lead to the known loss of smoothness while perturbations of the coefficients a_1, a_2, and a_3 do not.
