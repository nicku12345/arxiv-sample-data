We prove that the modified Korteweg- de Vries equation (mKdV) equation is unconditionally well-posed in H^s(\mathbb R) for s> \frac 13. Our method of proof combines the improvement of the energy method introduced recently by the first and third authors with the construction of a modified energy. Our approach also yields \textit{a priori} estimates for the solutions of mKdV in H^s(\mathbb R), for s>0, and enables us to construct weak solutions at this level of regularity.
