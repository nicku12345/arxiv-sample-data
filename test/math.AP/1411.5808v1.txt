We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlinear term of the Fisher-KPP type, depending on time t and admitting two limits as t\to\pm\infty. We derive the set of admissible asymptotic past and future speeds of transition fronts for such equation. We further show that any transition front which is non-critical as t\to-\infty always admits two asymptotic past and future speeds. We finally describe the asymptotic profiles of the non-critical fronts as t\to\pm\infty.
