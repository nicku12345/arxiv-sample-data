Denote with \mu_{1}(\Omega;e^{h\left(|x|\right)}) the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the Neumann problem \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{lll} -\text{div}\left(e^{h\left(|x|\right)}\nabla u\right) =\mu e^{h\left(|x|\right)}u & \text{in} & \Omega & & \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=0 & \text{on} & \partial \Omega , \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where \Omega  is a bounded and Lipschitz domain in \mathbb{R}^{N}. Under suitable assumption on h we prove that the ball centered at the origin is the unique set maximizing \mu_{1}(\Omega;e^{h\left(|x|\right)}) among all Lipschitz bounded domains \Omega  of \mathbb{R}^{N} of prescribed e^{h\left(|x|\right)}dx-measure and symmetric about the origin. Moreover, an example in the model case h\left(|x|\right) =|x|^{2}, shows that, in general, the assumption on the symmetry of the domain cannot be dropped. In the one-dimensional case, i.e. when \Omega reduces to an interval (a,b), we consider a wide class of weights (including both Gaussian and anti-Gaussian). We then describe the behavior of the eigenvalue as the interval (a,b) slides along the x-axis keeping fixed its weighted length.
