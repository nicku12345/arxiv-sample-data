Let \Omega be a smooth bounded domain in \mathbb{R}^{N}, N\geq1, let K, M be two nonnegative functions and let \alpha,\gamma>0. We study existence and nonexistence of positive solutions for singular problems of the form -\Delta u=K\left( x\right) u^{-\alpha}-\lambda M\left( x\right) u^{-\gamma} in \Omega, u=0 on \partial\Omega, where \lambda>0 is a real parameter. We mention that as a particular case our results apply to problems of the form -\Delta u=m\left( x\right) u^{-\gamma} in \Omega, u=0 on \partial\Omega, where m is allowed to change sign in \Omega.
