This article generalizes a previous work in which the author obtained a large lower bound for the lifespan of the solutions to the Primitive Equations, and proved convergence to the 3D quasi-geostrophic system for general and ill-prepared (possibly blowing-up) initial data that are regularization of vortex patches related to the potential velocity. These results were obtained for a very particular case when the kinematic viscosity \nu is equal to the heat diffusivity \nu ', turning the diffusion operator into the classical Laplacian. Obtaining the same results without this assumption is much more difficult as it involves a non-local diffusion operator. The key to the main result is a family of a priori estimates for the 3D-QG system that we obtained in a companion paper.
