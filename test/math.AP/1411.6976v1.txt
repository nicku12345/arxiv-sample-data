We continue to study regularity results for weak solutions of the large class of second order degenerate quasilinear equations of the form \begin{eqnarray} \text{div}\big(A(x,u,\nabla u)\big) = B(x,u,\nabla u)\text{ for }x\in\Omega\nonumber \end{eqnarray} as considered in our previous paper giving local boundedness of weak solutions. Here we derive a version of Harnack's inequality as well as local H\"older continuity for weak solutions. The possible degeneracy of an equation in the class is expressed in terms of a nonnegative definite quadratic form associated with its principal part. No smoothness is required of either the quadratic form or the coefficients of the equation. Our results extend ones obtained by J. Serrin and N. Trudinger for quasilinear equations, as well as ones for subelliptic linear equations obtained by Sawyer and Wheeden in their 2006 AMS memoir article.
