The convergence of a peridynamic model for solid mechanics inside heterogeneous media in the limit of vanishing nonlocality is analyzed. It is shown that the operator of linear peridynamics for an isotropic heterogeneous medium converges to the corresponding operator of linear elasticity when the material properties are sufficiently regular. On the other hand, when the material properties are discontinuous, i.e., when material interfaces are present, it is shown that the operator of linear peridynamics diverges, in the limit of vanishing nonlocality, at material interfaces. Nonlocal interface conditions, whose local limit implies the classical interface conditions of elasticity, are then developed and discussed. A peridynamics material interface model is introduced which generalizes the classical interface model of elasticity. The model consists of a new peridynamics operator along with nonlocal interface conditions. The new peridynamics interface model converges to the classical interface model of linear elasticity.
