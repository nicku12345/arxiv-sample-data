The Caputo time-derivative is usually defined pointwise for well-behaved functions, say, for continuously differentiable functions. Accordingly, in the theory of the partial fractional differential equations with the Caputo derivatives, the functional spaces where the solutions are looked for are often the spaces of the smooth functions that are too narrow. In this paper, we introduce a suitable definition of the Caputo derivative in the fractional Sobolev spaces and investigate it from the operator theoretic viewpoint. In particular, some important equivalences of the norms related to the fractional integration and differentiation operators in the fractional Sobolev spaces are given. These results are then applied for proving the maximal regularity of the solutions to some initial-boundary value problems for the time-fractional diffusion equation with the Caputo derivative in the fractional Sobolev spaces.
