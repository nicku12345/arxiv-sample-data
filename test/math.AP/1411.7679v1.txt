We prove weak-strong uniqueness results for the compressible Navier-Stokes system with degenerate viscosity coefficient and with vacuum in one dimension. In other words, we give conditions on the weak solution constructed in \cite{Jiu} so that it is unique. The novelty consists in dealing with initial density \rho_0 which contains vacuum. To do this we use the notion of relative entropy developed recently by Germain, Feireisl et al and Mellet and Vasseur (see \cite{PG,Fei,15}) combined with a new formulation of the compressible system (\cite{cras,CPAM,CPAM1,para}) (more precisely we introduce a new effective velocity which makes the system parabolic on the density and hyperbolic on this velocity).
