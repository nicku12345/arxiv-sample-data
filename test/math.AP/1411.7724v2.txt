A model of morphogen transport consisting of two evolutionary PDEs of reaction-diffusion type and three ODEs posed on a rectangular domain is analysed. We prove that the problem is globally well-posed and that the corresponding solutions converge, as the width of the rectangle tends to zero, to the unique solution of the one dimensional system which was analyzed in the first paper of the series. Main difficulties in the analysis stem from the presence of a singular source term - a Dirac Delta combined with no smoothing effect in the ODE part of the system.
