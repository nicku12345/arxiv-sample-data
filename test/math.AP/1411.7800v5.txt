We analyze the interior controllability problem for a nonlocal Schr\"odinger equation involving the fractional Laplace operator (-\Delta)^s, s\in(0,1), on a bounded C^{1,1} domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n. The controllability from a neighborhood of the boundary of the domain is obtained for exponents s in the interval [1/2,1), while for s<1/2 the equation is shown to be not controllable. The results follow applying the multiplier method, joint with a Pohozaev-type identity for the fractional Laplacian, and from an explicit computation of the spectrum of the operator in the one-dimensional case.
