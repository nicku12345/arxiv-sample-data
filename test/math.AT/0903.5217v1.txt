Working over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, we compute the cohomology of the subalgebra A(2) of the motivic Steenrod algebra that is generated by Sq^1, Sq^2, and Sq^4. The method of calculation is a motivic version of the May spectral sequence.   Speculatively assuming that there is a "motivic modular forms" spectrum with certain properties, we use an Adams-Novikov spectral sequence to compute the homotopy of such a spectrum at the prime 2.
