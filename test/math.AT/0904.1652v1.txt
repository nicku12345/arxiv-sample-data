For positive integers n and d, and the probability function 0\leq p(n)\leq 1, we let Y_{n,p,d} denote the probability space of all at most d-dimensional simplicial complexes on n vertices, which contain the full (d-1)-dimensional skeleton, and whose d-simplices appear with probability p(n). In this paper we determine the threshold function for vanishing of the top homology group in Y_{n,p,d}, for all d\geq 1.
