This is a companion paper our previous submission "\infty-categories monoidales rigides et caracteres de Chern", in which we give a comparison between functions on the derived loop space of a smooth scheme of caracteristic zero, and its algebraic de Rham cohomology. As a consequence we obtain functorial and multiplicative versions of the HKR decomposition theorem relating Hochschild homology and Hodge cohomology.
