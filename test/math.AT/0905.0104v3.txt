The Wall surgery obstruction groups have two interesting geometrically defined subgroups, consisting of the surgery obstructions between closed manifolds, and the inertial elements. We show that the inertia group I_{n+1}(\pi,w) and the closed manifold subgroup C_{n+1}(\pi,w) are equal in dimensions n+1\geq 6, for any finitely-presented group \pi and any orientation character w\colon \pi \to \cy 2.
