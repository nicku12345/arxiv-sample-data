Following Hopkins and Singer, we give a definition for the differential equivariant K-theory of a smooth manifold acted upon by a finite group. The ring structure for differential equivariant K-theory is developed explicitly. We also construct a pushforward map which parallels the topological pushforward in equivariant K-theory. An analytic formula for the pushforward to the differential equivariant K-theory of a point is conjectured, and proved in the boundary case, in the case of a free action, and for ordinary differential K-theory in general. The latter proof is due to K. Klonoff.
