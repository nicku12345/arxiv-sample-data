G. Raptis has recently proved that, assuming Vop\v{e}nka's principle, every cofibrantly generated model category is Quillen equivalent to a combinatorial one. His result remains true for a slightly more general concept of a cofibrantly generated model category. We show that Vop\v{e}nka's principle is equivalent to this claim. The set-theoretical status of the original Raptis' result is open.
