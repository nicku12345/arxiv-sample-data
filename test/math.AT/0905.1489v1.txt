In this paper one considers three homotopy functors on the category of manifolds, hH^\ast, cH^\ast, sH^\ast, and parallel them with other three homotopy functors on the category of connected commutative differential graded algebras, HH^\ast, CH^\ast, SH^\ast. If P is a smooth 1-connected manifold and the algebra is the de-Rham algebra of P the two pairs of functors agree but in general do not. The functors  HH^\ast  and CH^\ast can be also derived as Hochschild resp. cyclic homology of commutative differential graded algebra, but this is not the way they are introduced here. The third SH^\ast , although inspired from negative cyclic homology, can not be identified with any sort of cyclic homology of any algebra. The functor sH^\ast might play some role in topology. Important tools in the construction of the functors HH^\ast, CH^\ast and SH^\ast , in addition to the linear algebra suggested by cyclic theory, are Sullivan minimal model theorem and the "free loop" construction described in this paper.
