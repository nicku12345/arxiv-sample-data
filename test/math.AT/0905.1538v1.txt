We prove that for every reductive algebraic group H with centre of positive dimension and every integer K there is a smooth and projective variety X and an algebraic H-torsor P \to X such that the classifying map X \to \Bclass H induces an isomorphism in cohomology in degrees \le K. This is then applied to show that if G is a connected non-special group there is a G-torsor P \to X for which we do not have [P]=[G][X] in the (completion of the) Grothendieck ring of varieties.
