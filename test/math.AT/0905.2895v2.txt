In this paper the space of commuting elements in the central product G_{m,p} of m copies of the special unitary group SU(p) is studied, where p is a prime number. In particular, a computation for the number of path connected components of these spaces is given and the geometry of the moduli space \Rep(\mathbb Z^n, G_{m,p}) of flat principal G_{m,p}--bundles over the n--torus is completely described for all values of n, m and p.
