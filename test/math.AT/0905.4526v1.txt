We show that if N, an open connected n-manifold with finitely generated fundamental group, is C^{2} foliated by closed planes, then \pi_{1}(N) is a free group. This implies that if \pi_{1}(N) has an Abelian subgroup of rank greater than one, then \mathcal{F} has at least a non closed leaf. Next, we show that if N is three dimensional with fundamental group abelian of rank greater than one, then N is homeomorphic to \mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}. Furthermore, in this case we give a complete description of the foliation.
