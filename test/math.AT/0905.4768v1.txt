We define homotopy group actions in terms of families of A_\infty algebras indexed by a manifold M. We give explicit formulae for the A_\infty morphism induced by a path on the manifold and for the A_\infty homotopy corresponding to a pair of homotopic paths. Finally, we compute examples for finite groups and finitely generated free nonabelian groups and determine that every homotopy group action by a finite group is homotopic to a strict group action.
