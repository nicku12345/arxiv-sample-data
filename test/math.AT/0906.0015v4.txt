Over a monoidal model category, under some mild assumptions, we equip the categories of colored PROPs and their algebras with projective model category structures. A Boardman-Vogt style homotopy invariance result about algebras over cofibrant colored PROPs is proved. As an example, we define homotopy topological conformal field theories and observe that such structures are homotopy invariant.
