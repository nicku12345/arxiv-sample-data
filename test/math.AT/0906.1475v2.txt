Jorgensen's inequality gives a necessary condition for a non-elementary two generator group of isometries of real hyperbolic 2-space to be discrete. We give analogues of Jorgensen's inequality for non-elementary groups of isometries of quaternionic hyperbolic n-space generated by two elements, one of which is loxodromic.
