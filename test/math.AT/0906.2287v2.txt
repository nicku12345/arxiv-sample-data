It is known that Chern characteristic numbers of compact complex manifolds cannot have arbitrary values. They satisfy certain divisability conditions. W. Ebeling and S. M. Gusein-Zade gave a definition of Chern characteristic numbers of singular compact complex analytic varieties. We prove that there exists a singular projective variety with an arbitrary set of characteristic numbers.
