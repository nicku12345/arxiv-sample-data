We study the spaces of string links and homotopy string links in an arbitrary manifold using multivariable manifold calculus of functors. We construct multi-cosimplicial models for both spaces and deduce certain convergence properties of the associated Bousfield-Kan homotopy and cohomology spectral sequences when the ambient manifold is a Euclidean space of dimension four or more.
