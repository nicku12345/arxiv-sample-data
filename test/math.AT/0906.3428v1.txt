We study two variations of the Brauer algebra B_n(x). The first is the algebra A_n(x), which generalizes the Brauer algebra by considering loops. The second is the algebra L_n(x), the A_n(x)-subalgebra generated by diagrams without horizontal arcs. A_n(x) and L_n(x) have for x \neq 0 an hereditary-chain indexed by all integers. Following the ideas of Martin in the context of the partition algebra, and Doran et al. for the Brauer algebra, we study semisimplicity of A_n(x) using restriction and induction in A_n(x) and L_n(x). Our main result is that A_n(x) is semisimple if x \notin Z and that L_n(x) is semisimple if x \neq 0.
