The action of a torus group T on a symplectic toric manifold (M,\omega) often extends to an effective action of a (non-abelian) compact Lie group G. We may think of T and G as compact Lie subgroups of the symplectomorphism group Symp(M,\omega) of (M,\omega). On the other hand, (M,\omega) is determined by the associated moment polytope P by the result of Delzant. Therefore, the group G should be estimated in terms of P or we may say that a maximal compact Lie subgroup of Symp(M,\omega) containing the torus T should be described in terms of P.   In this paper, we introduce a root system R(P) associated to P and prove that any irreducible subsystem of R(P) is of type A and the root system \Delta(G) of the group G is a subsystem of R(P) (so that R(P) gives an upper bound for the identity component of G and any irreducible factor of \Delta(G) is of type A). We also introduce a homomorphism from the normalizer of T in G to an automorphism group Aut(P) of P, which detects the connected components of G. Finally we find a maximal compact Lie subgroup G_{\max} of Symp(M,\omega) containing the torus T.
