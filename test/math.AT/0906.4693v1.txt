Suppose that M is a connected orientable n-dimensional manifold and m>2n. If H^i(M,\R)=0 for i>0, it is proved that for each m there is a monomorphism H^m(W_n,\on{O}(n))\to H^m_{\on{cont}}(\on{Diff}M,\R). If M is closed and oriented, it is proved that for each m there is a monomorphism H^m(W_n,\on{O}(n))\to H^{m-n}_{\on{cont}}(\on{Diff}_+M,\R), where \on{Diff}_+M is a group of preserving orientation diffeomorphisms of M.
