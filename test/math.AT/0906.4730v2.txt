We study the operad of associative algebras equipped with a derivation. We show that it is determined by polynomials in several variables and substitution. Replacing polynomials by rational functions gives an operad which is isomorphic to the operad of "moulds". It provides an efficient environment for doing integro-differential calculus. Interesting variations are obtained by using formal group laws. The preceding case corresponds to the additive formal group law. We unravel the notion of homotopy associative algebra with derivation in the spirit of Kadeishvili's work.
