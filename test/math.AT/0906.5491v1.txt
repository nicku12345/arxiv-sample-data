Using stably free non-free relation modules we construct an infinite collection of 2-dimensional homotopy types, each of Euler-characteristic one and with trefoil fundamental group. This provides an affirmative answer to a question asked by Berridge and Dunwoody [J. London Math. Soc. 19 (1979) 433-436]. We also give new examples of exotic relation modules. We show that the relation module associated with the generating set x, y^4 for the Baumslag-Solitar group <x, y | xy^2x^{-1}=y^3> is stably free non-free of rank one.
