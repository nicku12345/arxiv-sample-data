We investigate operads for various n-ary algebras. As a useful tool we introduce galgalim - analogs of the Lie-hedra for n-ary algebras. We then focus to algebras with one anti-associative operation. We describe the relevant part of the deformation cohomology for this type of algebras using the minimal model for the anti-associative operad. We also discuss free partially associative algebras and formulate some open problems.
