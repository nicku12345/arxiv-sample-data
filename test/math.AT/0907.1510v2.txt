We show that the cellular objects in the module category over a motivic E infinity ring spectrum E can be described as the module category over a graded topological spectrum if E is strongly periodizable in our language. A similar statement is proven for triangulated categories of motives. Since MGL is strongly periodizable we obtain topological incarnations of motivic Landweber spectra. Under some categorical assumptions the unit object of the model category for triangulated motives is as well strongly periodizable giving motivic cochains whose module category models integral triangulated categories of Tate motives.
