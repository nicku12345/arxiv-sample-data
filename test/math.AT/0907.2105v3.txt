Let M be a path-connected closed oriented d-dimensional smooth manifold and let {\Bbbk} be a principal ideal domain. By Chas and Sullivan, the shifted free loop space homology of M, H_{*+d}(LM) is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. Let G be a topological group such that M is a classifying space of G. Denote by S_*(G) the (normalized) singular chains on G. Suppose that G is discrete or path-connected. We show that there is a Van Den Bergh type isomorphism  HH^{-p}(S_*(G),S_*(G))\cong HH_{p+d}(S_*(G),S_*(G)).  Therefore, the Gerstenhaber algebra HH^{*}(S_*(G),S_*(G)) is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra and we have a linear isomorphism HH^{*}(S_*(G),S_*(G))\cong H_{*+d}(LM). This linear isomorphism is expected to be an isomorphism of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras. We also give a new characterization of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra in term of derived bracket.
