The paper studies the problem of the cofibrant generation of a model category. We prove that, assuming Vop\v{e}nka's principle, every cofibrantly generated model category is Quillen equivalent to a combinatorial model category. We discuss cases where this result implies that the class of weak equivalences in a cofibrantly generated model category is accessibly embedded. We also prove a necessary condition for a model category to be cofibrantly generated by a set of generating cofibrations between cofibrant objects.
