The linking integral is an invariant of the link-type of two manifolds immersed in a Euclidean space. It is shown that the ordinary Gauss integral in three dimensions may be simplified to a winding number integral in two dimensions. This result is then generalized to show that in certain circumstances the linking integral between arbitrary manifolds may be similarly reduced to a lower dimensional integral.
