A simple trick invoking objective B-fields is employed to refine the concept of characteristic classes for twisted bundles. Then the objective stability and objective Einstein metrics are introduced and a new Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence is established between them. As an application the SO(3)-instanton moduli space is proved to be always orientable.
