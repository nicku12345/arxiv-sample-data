Given an exact relatively Pin Lagrangian embedding Q in a symplectic manifold M, we construct an A-infinity restriction functor from the wrapped Fukaya category of M to the category of modules on the differential graded algebra of chains over the based loop space of Q. If M is the cotangent bundle of Q, this functor induces an A-infinity equivalence between the wrapped Floer cohomology of a cotangent fibre and the chains over the based loop space of Q, extending a result proved by Abbondandolo and Schwarz at the level of homology.
