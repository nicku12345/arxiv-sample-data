We design an algorithm writing down presentations of graph braid groups. Generators are represented in terms of actual motions of robots moving without collisions on a given graph. A key ingredient is a new motion planning algorithm whose complexity is linear in the number of edges and quadratic in the number of robots. The computing algorithm implies that 2-point braid groups of all light planar graphs have presentations where all relators are commutators.
