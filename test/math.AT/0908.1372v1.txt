In this paper we systematically describe relations between various structure sets which arise naturally for pairs of compact topological manifolds with boundary. Our consideration is based on a deep analogy between the case of a compact manifold with boundary and the case of a closed manifold pair. This approach also gives a possibility to construct the obstruction groups for natural maps of various structure sets and to investigate their properties.
