We describe an A_\infty-quasi-equivalence of dg-categories between the first authors' \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{A}} ---the category of category of prefect A^0-modules with flat \Z-connection, corresponding to the de Rham dga \mathcal{A} of a compact manifold M--- and the dg-category of \emph{infinity-local systems} on M ---homotopy coherent representations of the smooth singular simplicial set of M, \Pinf. We understand this as a generalization of the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence to \Z-connections (\Z-graded superconnections in some circles). In one formulation an infinity-local system is simplicial map between the simplicial sets {\pi}_{\infty}M and a repackaging of the dg-category of cochain complexes by virtue of the simplicial nerve and Dold-Kan. This theory makes crucial use of Igusa's notion of higher holonomy transport for \Z-connections which is a derivative of Chen's main idea of generalized holonomy.
