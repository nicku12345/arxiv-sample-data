In this paper we study a new combinatorial invariant of simple polytopes, which comes from toric topology. With each simple n-polytope P with m facets we can associate a moment-angle complex Z_P with a canonical action of the torus T^m. Then s(P) is the maximal dimension of a toric subgroup that acts freely on Z_P. The problem stated by Victor M. Buchstaber is to find a simple combinatorial description of an s-number. We describe the main properties of s(P) and study the properties of simple n-polytopes with n+3 facets. In particular, we find the value of an s-number for such polytopes, a simple formula for their h-polynomials and the bigraded cohomology rings of the corresponding moment-angle complexes
