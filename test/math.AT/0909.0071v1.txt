We give a proof of the Singer conjecture (on the vanishing of reduced \ell^2-homology except in the middle dimension) for the Davis Complex \Sigma associated to a Coxeter system (W,S) whose nerve L is a triangulation of \mathbb{S}^2. We show that it follows from a theorem of Andreev, which gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for a classical reflection group to act on \mathbb{H}^3.
