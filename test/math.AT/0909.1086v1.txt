For a triple (G,A,\kappa) (where G is a group, A is a G-module and \kappa:G^3\to A is a 3-cocycle) and a G-module B we introduce a new cohomology theory _2H^n(G,A,\kappa;B) which we call the secondary cohomology. We give a construction that associates to a pointed topological space (X,x_0) an invariant _2\kappa^4\in_2H^4(\pi_1(X),\pi_2(X),\kappa^3;\pi_3(X)). This construction can be seen a "3-type" generalization of the classical k-invariant.
