Any oriented 4-dimensional real vector bundle is naturally a line bundle over a bundle of quaternion algebras. In this paper we give an account of modules over bundles of quaternion algebras, discussing Morita equivalence, characteristic classes and K-theory. The results have been used to describe obstructions for the existence of almost quaternionic structures on 8-dimensional Spinc manifolds and may be of some interest, also, in quaternionic and algebraic geometry.
