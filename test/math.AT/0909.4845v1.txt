Let \H_g be a genus g handlebody and \MCG_{2n}(\T_g) be the 2n-punctured mapping class group of \T_g=\partial\H_g. In this paper we study two particular subgroups of \MCG_{2n}(\T_g) which generalize Hilden groups. As well as Hilden groups are related to plate closures of braids, these generalizations are related to Heegaard splittings of manifolds and to bridge decompositions of links. Connections between these subgroups and motion groups of links in closed 3-manifolds are also provided.
