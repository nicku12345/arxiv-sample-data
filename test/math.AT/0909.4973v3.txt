We introduce the (general) homotopy groups of spheres as link invariants for Brunnian-type links through the investigations on the intersection subgroup of the normal closures of the meridians of strongly nonsplittable links. The homotopy groups measure the difference between the intersection subgroup and symmetric commutator subgroup of the normal closures of the meridians and give the invariants of the links obtained in this way. Moreover the higher homotopy-group invariants can produce some links that could not be detected by the Milnor invariants. Furthermore all homotopy groups of spheres can be obtained from the geometric Massey products on links.
