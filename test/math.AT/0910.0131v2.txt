In work by Ausoni, Dundas and Rognes a half magnetic monopole is discovered and describes an obstruction to creating a determinant K(ku) \to ku*. In fact it is an obstruction to creating a determinant gerbe map from K(ku) to K(Z,3). We describe this obstruction precisely using monoidal categories and define the notion of oriented 2-vector bundles, which removes this obstruction so that we can define a determinant gerbe. We also generalize Brylinskis notion of a connective structure to 2-vector bundles, in a way compatible with the determinant gerbe.
