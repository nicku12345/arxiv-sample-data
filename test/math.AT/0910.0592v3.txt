In a previous work we proved the uniqueness and functoriality of primary unfoldings on simple Thom-Mather spaces, which is a functor to the category of smooth manifolds. In this article we extend these results for any stratified Thom-Mather pseudomanifold with arbitary finite length, through a new kind of intermediate desingularizations, the unbendings, which coincide with primary unfoldings in the simple case.
