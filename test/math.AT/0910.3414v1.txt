In the early 1970's, Gelfand, Kalinin and Fuks found an exotic characteristic class of degree 7 in the Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of the Lie algebra of formal Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane. We prove that this cohomology class can be decomposed as a product of a certain leaf cohomology class of degree 5 and the transverse symplectic class. This is similar to the well known factorization of the Godbillon-Vey class for codimension n foliations. We also interpret the characteristic classes of transversely symplectic foliations introduced by Kontsevich in terms of the known classes and prove non-triviality for some of them.
