The topological fundamental group \pi_{1}^{top} is a topological invariant that assigns to each space a quasi-topological group and is discrete on spaces which are well behaved locally. For a totally path-disconnected, Hausdorff, unbased space X, we compute the topological fundamental group of the "hoop earring" space of X, which is the reduced suspension of X with disjoint basepoint. We do so by factorizing the quotient map \Omega(\Sigma X_{+},x)\to \pi_{1}^{top}(\Sigma X_{+},x) through a free topological monoid with involution M(X) such that the map M(X)\shortrightarrow \pi_{1}^{top}(\Sigma X_{+},x) is also a quotient map. \pi_{1}^{top}(\Sigma X_{+},x) is T1 and an embedding X\shortrightarrow \pi_{1}^{top}(\Sigma X_{+},x) illustrates that \pi_{1}^{top}(\Sigma X_{+},x) is not a topological group when X is not regular. These hoop earring spaces provide a simple class of counterexamples to the claim that \pi_{1}^{top} is a functor to the category of topological groups.
