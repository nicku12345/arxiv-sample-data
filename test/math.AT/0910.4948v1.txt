We introduce a new cubical model for homotopy types. More precisely, we'll define a category Qs with the following features: Qs is a PROP containing the classical box category as a subcategory, the category Qs-Set of presheaves of sets on Qs models the homotopy category, and combinatorial symmetric monoidal model categories with cofibrant unit all have homotopically well behaved Qs-Set enrichments.
