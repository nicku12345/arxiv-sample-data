We propose a homology theory for locally compact spaces with ends in which the ends play a special role. The approach is motivated by results for graphs with ends, where it has been highly successful. But it was unclear how the original graph-theoretical definition could be captured in the usual language for homology theories, so as to make it applicable to more general spaces. In this paper we provide such a general topological framework: we define a homology theory which satisfies the usual axioms, but which maintains the special role for ends that has made this homology work so well for graphs.
