We give a new, unexpected characterization of saturated fusion systems on a p-group S in terms of idempotents in the p-local double Burnside ring of S that satisfy a Frobenius reciprocity relation, and reformulate fusion-theoretic phenomena in the language of idempotents. Interpreting our results in stable homotopy, we answer a long-standing question on stable splittings of classifying spaces of finite groups, and generalize the Adams--Wilkerson criterion for recognizing rings of invariants in the cohomology of an elementary abelian p-group. This work is partly motivated by a conjecture of Haynes Miller which proposes retractive transfer triples as a purely homotopy-theoretic model for p-local finite groups. We take an important step toward proving this conjecture by showing that a retractive transfer triple gives rise to a p-local finite group when two technical assumptions are made, thus reducing the conjecture to proving those two assumptions.
