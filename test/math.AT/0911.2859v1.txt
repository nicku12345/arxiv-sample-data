This belongs to a series of papers devoted to the study of the cohomology of classifying spaces of Lie groupoids. Our aim here is to introduce and study the notion of representation up to homotopy of Lie groupoids, the resulting derived category, and to show that the adjoint representation is well defined as a representation up to homotopy. As an application, we extend Bott's spectral sequence converging to the cohomology of classifying spaces from Lie groups to Lie groupoids.
