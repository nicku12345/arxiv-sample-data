A group G is said to have the property R_\infty if every automorphism \phi \in {\rm Aut}(G) has an infinite number of \phi-twisted conjugacy classes. Recent work of Gon\c{c}alves and Kochloukova uses the \Sigma^n (Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz) invariants to show the R_{\infty} property for a certain class of groups, including the generalized Thompson's groups F_{n,0}. In this paper, we make use of the \Omega^n invariants, analogous to \Sigma^n, to show R_{\infty} for certain finitely generated groups. In particular, we give an alternate and simpler proof of the R_{\infty} property for BS(1,n). Moreover, we give examples for which the \Omega^n invariants can be used to determine the R_{\infty} property while the \Sigma^n invariants techniques cannot.
