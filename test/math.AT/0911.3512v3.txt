We give an alternative proof of the striking new Tverberg type theorem of Blagojevic and Ziegler, arXiv:0910.4987v1 [math.CO]. Our method also yields some new cases of "constrained Tverberg thereom" in the sense of Hell, including a simple colored Radon's theorem for d+3 points in R^d. This is a final version of the paper with improved presentation, corrected typos and added references.
