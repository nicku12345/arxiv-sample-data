In this article, we show the existence of conjugations on many simply-connected spin 6-manifolds with free integral cohomology. In a certain class the only condition on X^6 to admit a conjugation with fixed point set M^3 is the obvious one: the existence of a degree-halving ring isomorphism between the Z_2-cohomologies of X and M.
