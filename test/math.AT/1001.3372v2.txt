Given a family of based CW-pairs (\underline{X},\underline{A})=\{(X;A)\}^m_{i=1} together with an abstract simplicial complex K with m vertices, there is an associated based CW-complex Z(K;(\underline{X},\underline{A})) known as a generalized moment-angle complex.   The decomposition theorem of \cite{bbcg}, \cite{bbcg2} splits the suspension of Z(K; (\underline{X}, \underline{A})) into a bouquet of spaces determined by the full sub-complexes of K. Thatdecomposition theorem is used here to describe the ring structure for the cohomology of Z(K; (\underline{X}, \underline{A})). Explicit computations are made for families of suspension pairs and for the cases where X_i is the cone on A_i. These results complement and generalize those of Davis-Januszkiewicz, Franz, Hochster as well as Panov, and Baskakov-Buchstaber-Panov. Under conditions stated below, these theorems also apply for generalized cohomology theories.
