By use of Siegel's method and the classical results of homotopy groups of spheres and Lie groups, we determine some Gottlieb groups of projective spaces or give the lower bounds of their orders. Furthermore, making use of the properties of Whitehead products, we determine some Whitehead center groups of projective spaces.
