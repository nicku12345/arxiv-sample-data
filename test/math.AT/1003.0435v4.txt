Let \phi:\Z/p\to GL_{n}(\Z) denote an integral representation of the cyclic group of prime order p. This induces a \Z/p-action on the torus X=\R^{n}/\Z^{n}. The goal of this paper is to explicitly compute the cohomology groups H^{*}(X/\Z/p;\Z) for any such representation. As a consequence we obtain an explicit calculation of the integral cohomology of the classifying space associated to the family of finite subgroups for any crystallographic group \Gamma =\Z^n\rtimes\Z/p with prime holonomy.
