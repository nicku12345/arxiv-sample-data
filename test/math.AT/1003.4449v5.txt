We prove that the algebra of chains on the based loop space recovers the derived (wrapped) Fukaya category of the cotangent bundle of a closed smooth orientable manifold. The main new idea is the proof that a cotangent fibre generates the Fukaya category using a version of the map from symplectic cohomology to the homology of the free loop space introduced by Cieliebak and Latschev.
