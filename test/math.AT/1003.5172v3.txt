We prove that compact quaternionic-K\"ahler manifolds of positive scalar curvature admit no almost complex structure, even in the weak sense, except for the complex Grassmannians Gr_2(C^{n+2}). We also prove that irreducible inner symmetric spaces M^{4n} of compact type are not weakly complex, except for spheres and Hermitian symmetric spaces.
