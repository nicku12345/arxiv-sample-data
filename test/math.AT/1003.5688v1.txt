The stable Kneser graph SG_{n,k}, n\ge1, k\ge0, introduced by Schrijver \cite{schrijver}, is a vertex critical graph with chromatic number k+2, its vertices are certain subsets of a set of cardinality m=2n+k. Bj\"orner and de Longueville \cite{anders-mark} have shown that its box complex is homotopy equivalent to a sphere, \Hom(K_2,SG_{n,k})\homot\Sphere^k. The dihedral group D_{2m} acts canonically on SG_{n,k}, the group C_2 with 2 elements acts on K_2. We almost determine the (C_2\times D_{2m})-homotopy type of \Hom(K_2,SG_{n,k}) and use this to prove the following results. The graphs SG_{2s,4} are homotopy test graphs, i.e. for every graph H and r\ge0 such that \Hom(SG_{2s,4},H) is (r-1)-connected, the chromatic number \chi(H) is at least r+6. If k\notin\set{0,1,2,4,8} and n\ge N(k) then SG_{n,k} is not a homotopy test graph, i.e.\ there are a graph G and an r\ge1 such that \Hom(SG_{n,k}, G) is (r-1)-connected and \chi(G)<r+k+2.
