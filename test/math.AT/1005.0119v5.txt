If A is a commutative ring, there exists a classifying ring L^A of formal groups with complex multiplication by A, i.e., "formal A-modules." In this paper, the basic properties of the functor that sends A to L^A are developed and studied. When A is a Dedekind domain, the problem of computing L^A was studied by M. Lazard, by V. Drinfeld, and by M. Hazewinkel, who showed that L^A is a polynomial algebra whenever A is a discrete valuation ring or a (global) number ring of class number 1, Hazewinkel observed that L^A is not necessarily polynomial for more general Dedekind domains A, but no computations of L^A have ever appeared in any case when L^A is not a polynomial algebra. In the present paper, the ring L^A is computed, modulo torsion, for all Dedekind domains A of characteristic zero, including many cases in which L^A fails to be a polynomial algebra. Qualitative features (lifting and extensions) of the moduli theory of formal modules are then derived.
