In this work we describe the Chen-Ruan cohomology of the moduli stacks of smooth and stable genus 2 pointed curves, and its algebraic counterpart: the stringy Chow ring. In the first half of the paper we compute the additive structure of the Chen-Ruan cohomology ring for the moduli stack of stable pointed genus 2 curves, describing it as a rationally graded vector space. In the second part we give generators for the even Chen--Ruan cohomology ring as an algebra on the ordinary cohomology.
