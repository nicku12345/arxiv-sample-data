The relative Grothendieck group K_0(\m V/X) is the free abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes of complex algebraic varieties over X modulo the "scissor relation". The motivic Hirzebruch class {T_y}_*: K_0(\m V /X) \to H_*^{BM}(X) \otimes \bQ[y] is a unique natural transformation satisfying that for a nonsingular variety X the value {T_y}_*([X \xrightarrow {\op {id}_X} X]) of the isomorphism class of the identity X \xrightarrow {id_X} X is the Poincar\'e dual of the Hirzebruch cohomology class of the tangent bundle TX. It "unifies" the well-known three characteristic classes of singular varieties: MacPherson's Chern class, Baum-Fulton-MacPherson's Todd class (or Riemann-Roch) and Goresky-MacPherson's L-class or Cappell-Shaneson's L-class. In this paper we construct a bivariant relative Grothendieck group \bK_0(\m V/X \to Y) so that it equals the original relative Grothendieck group K_0(\m V/X) when Y is a point. We also construct a unique Grothendieck transformation T_y: \bK_0(\m V/X \to Y) \to \bH(X \to Y) \otimes \bQ[y] satisfying a certain normalization condition for a smooth morphism so that it equals the motivic Hirzebruch class {T_y}_*: K_0(\m V /X) \to H_*^{BM}(X) \otimes \bQ[y] when Y is a point. When y =0, T_0: \bK_0(\m V/X \to Y) \to \bH(X \to Y) \otimes \bQ is a "motivic" lift of Fulton-MacPherson's bivariant Riemann-Roch \ga_{td}^{\op {FM}}:\bK_{alg}(X \to Y) \to \bH(X \to Y) \otimes \bQ.
