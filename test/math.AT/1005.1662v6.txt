We consider brave new cochain extensions F(BG_+,R)\to F(EG_+,R), where R is either a Lubin-Tate spectrum E_n or the related 2-periodic Morava K-theory K_n, and G is a finite group. When R is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, in some good cases such an extension is a G-Galois extension in the sense of John Rognes, but not always faithful. We prove that for E_n and K_n these extensions are always faithful in the K_n local category. However, for a cyclic p-group C_{p^r}, the cochain extension F({BC_{p^r}}_+,E_n) \to F({EC_{p^r}}_+,E_n) is not a Galois extensions because it ramifies. As a consequence, it follows that the E_n-theory Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence for G and BG does not always converge to its expected target.
