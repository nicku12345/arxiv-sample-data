We provide a proof in the language of model categories and symmetric spectra of Lurie's theorem that topological complex K-theory represents orientations of the derived multiplicative group. Then we generalize this result to the motivic situation. Along the way, a number of useful model structures and Quillen adjunctions both in the classical and in the motivic case are established.
