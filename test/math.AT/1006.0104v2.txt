Let \mathcal F be a family of compact convex sets in \mathbb R^d. We say that \mathcal F  has a \emph{topological \rho-transversal of index (m,k)} (\rho<m, 0<k\leq d-m) if there are, homologically, as many transversal m-planes to \mathcal F as m-planes containing a fixed \rho-plane in \mathbb R^{m+k}.   Clearly, if \mathcal F has a \rho-transversal plane, then \mathcal F has a topological \rho-transversal of index (m,k), for \rho<m and k\leq d-m. The converse is not true in general.   We prove that for a family \mathcal F of \rho+k+1 compact convex sets in \mathbb R^d a topological \rho-transversal of index (m,k) implies an ordinary \rho-transversal. We use this result, together with the multiplication formulas for Schubert cocycles, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the Grassmannian, and different versions of the colorful Helly theorem by B\'ar\'any and Lov\'asz, to obtain some geometric consequences.
