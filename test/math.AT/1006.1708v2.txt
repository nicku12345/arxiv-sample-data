Let M be a smooth connected orientable compact surface. Denote by F(M,S^1) the space of all Morse functions f:M\to S^1 having no critical points on the boundary of M and such that for every boundary component V of M the restriction f|_{V}:V\to S^1 is either a constant map or a covering map. Endow F(M,S^1) with the C^{\infty}-topology. In this note the connected components of F(M,S^1) are classified. This result extends the results of S. V. Matveev, V. V. Sharko, and the author for the case of Morse functions being locally constant on the boundary of M.
