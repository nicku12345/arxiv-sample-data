In this paper we study the hyperbolicity properties of a class of random groups arising as graph products associated to random graphs. Recall, that the construction of a graph product is a generalization of the constructions of right-angled Artin and Coxeter groups. We adopt the Erdos - Renyi model of a random graph and find precise threshold functions for the hyperbolicity (or relative hyperbolicity). We aslo study automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups associated to random graphs. We show that with probability tending to one as n\to \infty, random right-angled Artin groups have finite outer automorphism groups, assuming that the probability parameter p is constant and satisfies 0.2929 <p<1.
