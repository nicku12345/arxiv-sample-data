We study the Linial--Meshulam model of random two-dimensional simplicial complexes. One of our main results states that for p\ll n^{-1} a random 2-complex Y collapses simplicially to a graph and, in particular, the fundamental group \pi_1(Y) is free and H_2(Y)=0, a.a.s. We also prove that, if the probability parameter p satisfies p\gg n^{-1/2+\epsilon}, where \epsilon>0, then an arbitrary finite two-dimensional simplicial complex admits a topological embedding into a random 2-complex, with probability tending to one as n\to \infty. We also establish several related results, for example we show that for p<c/n with c<3 the fundamental group of a random 2-complex contains a nonabelian free subgroup. Our method is based on exploiting explicit thresholds (established in the paper) for the existence of simplicial embedding and immersions of 2-complexes into a random 2-complex.
