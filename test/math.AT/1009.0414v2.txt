We determine the invariants, with arbitrary determinant twists, of the parabolic subgroups of the finite general linear group GL_n(q) acting on the tensor product of the symmetric algebra and the exterior algebra of the natural GL_n(q)-module V. In addition, we obtain the graded multiplicity of the Steinberg module of GL_n(q) in the tensor product of the symmetric algebra and the exterior algebra of V, twisted by an arbitrary determinant power.
