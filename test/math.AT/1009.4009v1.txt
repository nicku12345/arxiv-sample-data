Let X be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus at least two. Let r be a prime number and \xi a holomorphic line bundle on it such that r is not a divisor of degree(\xi). Let {\mathcal M}_\xi(r) denote the moduli space of stable vector bundles over X of rank r and determinant \xi. By \Gamma we will denote the group of line bundles L over X such that L^{\otimes r} is trivial. This group \Gamma acts on {\mathcal M}_\xi(r). We compute the Chen-Ruan cohomology of the corresponding orbifold.
