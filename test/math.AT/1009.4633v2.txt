This is a revised version of the author's PhD thesis, including the corrections by the examiners. It also includes a few additional small corrections.   In this thesis the objects of study are classifying spaces of groups with stabilisers in a given family of subgroups. Given a group G and a family of subgroups we study the minimal dimension a classifying space can have. We focus on classifying spaces with virtually cyclic stabilisers.
