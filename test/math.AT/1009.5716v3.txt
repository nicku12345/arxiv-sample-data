We use basic results from shape theory to investigate inverse systems of covers and the corresponding fundamental pro-groups. Many of the standard shape-theoretic definitions become simpler in the context of covering systems and filtered groups, and we develop the theory largely within this context. We give several applications, including a classification of maps between P-adic solenoids up to homotopy. Also, we develop a description of the group of homotopy self-equivalences for certain aspherical solenoids, expanding on a result of Odden regarding the universal hypebolic solenoid.
