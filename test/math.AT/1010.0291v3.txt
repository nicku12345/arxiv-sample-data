In this paper, using the topological interpretation of the Baer invariant of a group G, \mathcal{V}M(G), with respect to an arbitrary variety \mathcal{V}, we extend a result of Burns and Ellis (Math. Z. 226 (1997) 405-428) on the second nilpotent multiplier of a free product of two groups to the c-nilpotent multipliers, for all c\geq 1. In particular, we show that M^{(c)}(G\ast H)\cong M^{(c)}(G)\oplus M^{(c)}(H) when G and H are finite groups with some conditions or when G and H are two perfect groups.
