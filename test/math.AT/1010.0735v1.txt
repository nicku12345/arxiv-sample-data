In this paper the space of almost commuting elements in a Lie group is studied through a homotopical point of view. In particular a stable splitting after one suspension is derived for these spaces and their quotients under conjugation. A complete description for the stable factors appearing in this splitting is provided for compact connected Lie groups of rank one.By using symmetric products, the colimits \Rep(\Z^n, SU), \Rep(\Z^n,U) and \Rep(\Z^n, Sp) are explicitly described as finite products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces.
