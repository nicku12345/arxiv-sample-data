We give an interpretation of J-spaces in terms of symmetric spectra in symmetric sequences. As application we show how one can define graded endomorphism objects in a general situation. As example we discuss the motivic bigraded endomorphisms of a motivic E-infinity ring spectrum. Finally we give an infinity categorical interpretation of our result.
