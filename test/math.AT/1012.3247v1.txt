In this paper, using a relationship between the Schur multiplier of a group G, the fundamental group, and the second homology group of the Eilenberg-MacLane space of G, we present new proofs for some famous properties of the Schur multiplier and its structure for the free product and the direct product with an algebraic topological approach. Also, we try to find the Schur multiplier of a free amalgamated product in terms of Schur multipliers of its factors, which is a new result.
