We introduce the groupoidal analogue \tilde\Theta to Joyal's cell category \Theta and we prove that \tilde\Theta is a strict test category in the sense of Grothendieck. This implies that presheaves on \tilde\Theta model homotopy types in a canonical way. We also prove that the canonical functor from \Theta to \tilde\Theta is aspherical, again in the sense of Grothendieck. This allows us to compare weak equivalences of presheaves on \tilde\Theta to weak equivalences of presheaves on \Theta. Our proofs apply to other categories analogous to \Theta.
