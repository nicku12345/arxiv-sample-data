Let k be a perfect field of characteristic p and let W_n(k) denote the p-typical Witt vectors of length n. For example, W_n(\mathbb{F}_p)=\mathbb{Z}/p^n. We study the algebraic K-theory of W_n(k), and prove that K(W_n(k)) satisfies "Galois descent". We also compute the K-groups through a range of degrees, and show that the first p-torsion element in the stable homotopy groups of spheres is detected in K_{2p-3}(W_n(k)) for all n \geq 2.
