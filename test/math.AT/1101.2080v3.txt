We describe two constructions giving rise to curved A_{\infty}-algebras. The first consists of deforming A_{\infty}-algebras, while the second involves transferring curved dg structures that are deformations of (ordinary) dg structures along chain contractions. As an application of the second construction, given a vector bundle on a polyhedron X, we exhibit a curved A_{\infty}-structure on the complex of matrix-valued cochains of sufficiently fine triangulations of X. We use this structure as a motivation to develop a homotopy associative version of Chern-Weil theory.
