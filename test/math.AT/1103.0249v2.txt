For any n\geq 7, k\geq 3, we give pairs of compact flat n-manifolds M, M' with holonomy groups \mathbb Z_2^k, that are strongly isospectral, hence isospectral on p-forms for all values of p, having nonisomorphic cohomology rings. Moreover, if n is even, M is K\"ahler while M' is not. Furthermore, with the help of a computer program we show the existence of large Sunada isospectral families; for instance, for n=24 and k=3 there is a family of eight compact flat manifolds (four of them K\"ahler) having very different cohomology rings. In particular, the cardinalities of the sets of primitive forms are different for all manifolds.
