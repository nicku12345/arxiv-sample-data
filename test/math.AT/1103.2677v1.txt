The category of simplicial R-coalgebras over a presheaf of commutative unital rings on a small Grothendieck site is endowed with a left proper, simplicial, cofibrantly generated model category structure where the weak equivalences are the local weak equivalences of the underlying simplicial presheaves. This model category is naturally linked to the R-local homotopy theory of simplicial presheaves and the homotopy theory of simplicial R-modules by Quillen adjunctions. We study the comparison with the R-local homotopy category of simplicial presheaves in the special case where R is a presheaf of algebraically closed (or perfect) fields. If R is a presheaf of algebraically closed fields, we show that the R-local homotopy category of simplicial presheaves embeds fully faithfully in the homotopy category of simplicial R-coalgebras.
