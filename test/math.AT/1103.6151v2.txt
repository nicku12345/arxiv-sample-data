It is well-known that for a line bundle over a closed framed manifold, its sphere bundle can also be given the structure of a framed manifold, usually referred to as a transfer. Given a pair of lines, the procedure can be generalized to obtain a double transfer. We study the quaternionic case, and derive a simple formula for the f-invariant of the underlying bordism class, enabling us to investigate its status in the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. As an application, we treat the situation of quaternionic flag manifolds.
