In this paper we compute the cohomology groups of the second Voronoi compactification of the moduli space of abelian fourfolds in all degrees with the exception of the middle degree 10. We also compute the cohomology groups of the perfect cone compactification in degree < 10. The main tool is the investigation of the strata of the compactification corresponding to semi-abelic varieties with constant torus rank.
