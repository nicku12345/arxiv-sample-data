Let M^{2n} be a unitary torus (2n)-manifold, i.e., a (2n)-dimensional oriented stable complex connected closed T^n-manifold having a nonempty fixed set. In this paper we show that M bounds equivariantly if and only if the equivariant Chern numbers < (c_1^{T^n})^i(c_2^{T^n})^j, [M]>=0 for all i, j\in {\Bbb N}, where c_l^{T^n} denotes the lth equivariant Chern class of M. As a consequence, we also show that if M does not bound equivariantly then the number of fixed points is at least \lceil{n\over2}\rceil+1.
