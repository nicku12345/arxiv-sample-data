In this paper, using a relation between Schur multipliers of pairs and triples of groups, the fundamental group and homology groups of a homotopy pushout of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, we present among other things some behaviors of Schur multipliers of pairs and triples with respect to free, amalgamated free, and direct products and also direct limits with topological approach.
