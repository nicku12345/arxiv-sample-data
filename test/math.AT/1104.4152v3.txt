The Topological Representation Theorem for (oriented) matroids states that every (oriented) matroid can be realized as the intersection lattice of an arrangement of codimension one homotopy spheres on a homotopy sphere. In this paper, we use a construction of Engstr\"om to show that structure-preserving maps between matroids induce topological mappings between their representations; a result previously known only in the oriented case. Specifically, we show that weak maps induce continuous maps and that the process is a functor from the category of matroids with weak maps to the homotopy category of topological spaces. We also give a new and conceptual proof of a result regarding the Whitney numbers of the first kind of a matroid.
