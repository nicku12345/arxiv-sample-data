In this article, we give a classification of Alexander modules of null-homologous knots in rational homology spheres. We characterize these modules A equipped with their Blanchfield forms \phi, and the modules A such that there is a unique isomorphism class of (A,\phi), and we prove that for the other modules A, there are infinitely many such classes. We realise all these (A,\phi) by explicit knots in rational homology spheres.
