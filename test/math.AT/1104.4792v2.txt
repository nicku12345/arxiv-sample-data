Let M be a smooth closed orientable surface, and let F be the space of Morse functions on M such that at least \chi(M)+1 critical points of each function of F are labeled by different labels (enumerated). Endow the space F with C^\infty-topology. We prove the homotopy equivalence F\sim R\times{\widetilde{\cal M}} where R is one of the manifolds {\mathbb R}P^3, S^1\times S^1 and the point in dependence on the sign of \chi(M), and {\widetilde{\cal M}} is the universal moduli space of framed Morse functions, which is a smooth stratified manifold. Morse inequalities for the Betti numbers of the space F are obtained.
