Let M be a smooth closed orientable surface. Let F be the space of Morse functions on M having fixed number of critical points of each index, moreover at least \chi(M)+1 critical points are labeled by different labels (enumerated). A notion of a skew cylindric-polyhedral complex, which generalizes the notion of a polyhedral complex, is introduced. The skew cylindric-polyhedral complex \mathbb{\widetilde K} (the "complex of framed Morse functions"), associated with the space F, is defined. In the case when M=S^2, the polyhedron \mathbb{\widetilde K} is finite; its Euler characteristic is evaluated and the Morse inequalities for its Betti numbers are obtained. A relation between the homotopy types of the polyhedron \mathbb{\widetilde K} and the space F of Morse functions, endowed with the C^\infty-topology, is indicated.
