Let S be subsemigroup with nonempty interior of a complex simple Lie group G. It is proved that S=G if S contains a subgroup G(\alpha) \approx \mathrm{Sl}(2,\mathbb{C})  generated by the \exp \mathfrak{g}_{\pm \alpha}, where \mathfrak{g}%_{\alpha} is the root space of the root \alpha . The proof uses the fact, proved before, that the invariant control set of S is contractible in some flag manifold if S is proper, and exploits the fact that several orbits of G(\alpha) are 2-spheres not null homotopic. The result is applied to revisit a controllability theorem and get some improvements.
