A new notion of cohomology is introduced for MT-spaces, which are measurable and topological spaces whose measurable structure may not agree with the Borel \sigma-algebra of their topology. The main examples of MTspaces are measurable foliations. This is a singular version of the measurable simplicial cohomology defined by Heitsch and Lazarov for foliations and extended by Bermudez for MT-spaces. Basic topics of algebraic topology are adapted, and applications to the theory of foliations are given. Moreover we introduce a new notion of singular L2-cohomology for MT-spaces.
