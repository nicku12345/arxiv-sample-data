We classify extensions of a group G by a braided 2-group \mathcal{B} as defined by Drinfeld, Gelaki, Nikshych, and Ostrik. We describe such extensions as homotopy classes of maps from the classifying space of G to the classifying space of the 3-group of braided \mathcal{B}-bitorsors. The Postnikov system of the latter space contains a generalization of the classical Pontryagin square to the setting of local coefficients, which has been previously discussed by Baues and more recently, in a setting close to ours, by Etingof, Nikshych, and Ostrik. We give an explicit cochain-level description of this Pontryagin square for group cohomology.
