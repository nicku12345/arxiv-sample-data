In this paper, we use the theory of simplicial groups to develop the Schur multiplier of a pair of groups (G,N) to the Baer invariant of it, \mathcal{V}M(G,N), with respect to an arbitrary variety \mathcal{V}. Moreover, we present among other things some behaviors of Baer invariants of a pair of groups with respect to the free product and the direct limit. Finally we prove that the nilpotent multiplier of a pair of groups does commute with the free product of finite groups of mutually coprime orders.
