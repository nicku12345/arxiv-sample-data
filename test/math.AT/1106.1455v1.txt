Fix an integer m and a multi-index p = (p_1, ..., p_r) of integers p_i < m-2. The set of links of codimension > 2, with multi-index p, E(p, m), is the set of smooth isotopy classes of smooth embeddings of the disjoint union of the p_i-spheres into the m-sphere. Haefliger showed that E(p, m) is a finitely generated abelian group with respect to embedded connected summation and computed its rank in the case of knots, i.e. r=1. For r > 1 and for restrictions on p the rank of this group can be computed using results of Haefliger or Nezhinsky. Our main result determines the rank of the group E(p, m) in general. In particular we determine precisely when E(p,m) is finite. We also accomplish these tasks for framed links. Our proofs are based on the Haefliger exact sequence for groups of links and the theory of Lie algebras.
