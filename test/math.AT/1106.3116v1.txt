Let M be a smooth closed orientable surface. Let F be the space of Morse functions on M, and \mathbb{F}^1 the space of framed Morse functions, both endowed with C^\infty-topology. The space \mathbb{F}^0 of special framed Morse functions is defined. We prove that the inclusion mapping \mathbb{F}^0\hookrightarrow\mathbb{F}^1 is a homotopy equivalence. In the case when at least \chi(M)+1 critical points of each function of F are labeled, homotopy equivalences \mathbb{\widetilde K}\sim\widetilde{\cal M} and F\sim\mathbb{F}^0\sim{\mathscr D}^0\times\mathbb{\widetilde K} are proved, where \mathbb{\widetilde K} is the complex of framed Morse functions, \widetilde{\cal M}\approx\mathbb{F}^1/{\mathscr D}^0 is the universal moduli space of framed Morse functions, {\mathscr D}^0 is the group of self-diffeomorphisms of M homotopic to the identity.
