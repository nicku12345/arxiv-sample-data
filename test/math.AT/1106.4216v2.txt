We disprove a conjecture stating that the integral cohomology of any crystallographic group Z^n \rtimes Z_m is given by the cohomology of Z_m with coefficients in the cohomology of the group Z^n, by providing a complete list of counterexamples up to dimension 5. We also find a counterexample with odd order holonomy, m=9, in dimension 8 and finish the computations of the cohomology of 6-dimensional crystallographic groups arising as orbifold fundamental groups of certain Calabi-Yau toroidal orbifolds.
