Witt spaces are pseudomanifolds for which the middle-perversity intersection homology with rational coefficients is self-dual. We give a new construction of the symmetric signature for Witt spaces which is similar in spirit to the construction given by Miscenko for manifolds. Our construction has all of the expected properties, including invariance under stratified homotopy equivalence.
