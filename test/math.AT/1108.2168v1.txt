Cobordism groups of cooriented fold maps of codimension 1 are computed completely. Namely their odd torsion part coincides with that of the stable homotopy group of spheres in the same dimension, while the 2-primary part is the kernel of the Kahn-Priddy map. (The Kahn-Priddy map is an epimorhism of the stable homotopy group of the infinite dimensional real projective space onto the 2-primary part of the stable homotopy group of spheres). Analogous results - modulo small primes - are obtained for cusp maps and more complicated Morin maps as well.
