In this article we study some interesting properties of the q-Analog singular homology, which is a generalization of the usual singular homology, suitably adapted to the context of N-complex and amplitude homology \cite{kapranov}. We calculate the q-Analog singular homology of a convex space. Although it is a local matter; this is an important step in order to understand the presheaf of q-chains and its algebraic properties. Our result is consistent with those of Dubois-Viol\`ette & Henneaux \cite{dubois3}. Some of these results were presented for the XVIII Congreso Colombiano de Matem\'aticas in Bucaramanga, 2011.
