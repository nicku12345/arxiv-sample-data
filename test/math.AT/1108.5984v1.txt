In the past few years, substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the algebra of kappa classes on the moduli spaces of curves. My goal here is to provide a short introduction to the new results. Along the way, I will discuss several open questions. The article accompanies my talk at "A celebration of algebraic geometry" at Harvard in honor of the 60th birthday of J. Harris.
