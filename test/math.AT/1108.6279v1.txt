By examining commensurators of virtually cyclic groups, we show that for each natural number n, any locally finite-by-virtually cyclic group of cardinality aleph_n admits a finite dimensional classifying space with virtually cyclic stabilizers of dimension n+3. As a corollary, we prove that every elementary amenable group of finite Hirsch length and cardinality aleph_n admits a finite dimensional classifying space with virtually cyclic stabilizers.
