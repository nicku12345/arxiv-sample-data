We study a class of smooth torus manifolds whose orbit space has the combinatorial structure of a simple polytope with holes. We construct moment angle manifolds for such polytopes with holes and use them to prove that the associated torus manifolds admit stable almost complex structure. We give a combinatorial formula for the Hirzebruch \chi_y genus of these torus manifolds. We show that they have (invariant) almost complex structure if they admit positive omniorientation. We give examples of almost complex manifolds that do not admit a complex structure. When the dimension is four, we calculate the homology groups and describe a method for computing the cohomology ring.
