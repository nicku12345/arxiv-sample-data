We build a spectral sequence converging to the cohomology of a fusion system with a strongly closed subgroup. This spectral sequence is related to the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence and coincides with it for the case of an extension of groups. Nevertheless, the new spectral sequence applies to more general situations like finite simple groups with a strongly closed subgroup and exotic fusion systems with a strongly closed subgroup. We prove an analogue of a result of Stallings in the context of fusion preserving homomorphisms and deduce Tate's p-nilpotency criterion as a corollary.
