We generalize the very well known boundary operator of the ordinary singular homology theory, defined in many books about algebraic topology. We describe a variant of this ordinary simplicial boundary operator where the usual boundary (n-1)-simplices of each n-simplex are replaced by combinations of internal (n-1)- simplices parallel to the faces. This construction may lead to an infinite class of extraordinary non-isomorphic homology theories. We show further some interesting constructions on the standard simplex.
