We show in this article that, for any group G indecomposable for the free product * and non-isomorphic to \mathbf{Z}, the canonical inclusion {\rm Aut}(G^{*n})\to {\rm Aut}(G^{* n+1}) induces an isomorphism between the homology groups H_i for n\geq 2i+2, as was conjectured by Hatcher and Wahl. In fact we show a little more --- in particular, the result is true for any group G if we replace the automorphism group of the free product by the subgroup of symmetric automorphisms. For this purpose we use constructions and acyclicity results due to McCullough-Miller and Chen-Glover-Jensen and functoriality properties which allow us to apply classical methods in functor homology.
