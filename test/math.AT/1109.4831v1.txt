In the paper we investigate the degree and the homotopy theory of Orlicz-Sobolev mappings W^{1,P}(M,N) between manifolds, where the Young function P satisfies a divergence condition and forms a slightly larger space than W^{1,n}, n=\dim M. In particular, we prove that if M and N are compact oriented manifolds without boundary and \dim M=\dim N=n, then the degree is well defined in W^{1,P}(M,N) if and only if the universal cover of N is not a rational homology sphere, and in the case n=4, if and only if N is not homeomorphic to S^4.
