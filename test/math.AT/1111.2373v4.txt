Let S be a hyperbolic oriented Riemann surface of finite type. The main purpose of this paper is to show that non-trivial geometric intersection between closed curves on S is detected by some symplectic submodules they naturally determine in the homology groups of the compactifications of unramified p-coverings of S, for p\geq 2 a fixed prime. In particular, this gives a characterization of simple closed curves on S in terms of homology groups of p-coverings.   We then define a p-adic Reidemeister pairing on the fundamental group of S and show that the free homotopy classes of two loops have trivial geometric intersection if and only if they are orthogonal with respect to this pairing.   As an application, we give a geometric argument to prove that oriented surface groups are conjugacy p-separable (a combinatorial proof of this fact was recentely given by Paris).
