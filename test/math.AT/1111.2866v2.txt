Suppose \Cal R is the complement of an essential arrangement of toric hyperlanes in the complex torus (\C^*)^n and \pi=\pi_1(\Cal R). We show that H^*(\Cal R;A) vanishes except in the top degree n when A is one of the following systems of local coefficients: (a) a system of nonresonant coefficients in a complex line bundle, (b) the von Neumann algebra \cn\pi, or (c) the group ring \zz \pi. In case (a) the dimension of H^n is |e(\Cal R)| where e(\Cal R) denotes the Euler characteristic, and in case (b) the n^{\mathrm{th}} \eltwo Betti number is also |e(\Cal R)|.
