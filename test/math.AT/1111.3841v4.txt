In this note we introduce primitive cohomology groups of locally conformal symplectic manifolds (M^{2n}, \omega, \theta). We study the relation between the primitive cohomology groups and the Lichnerowicz-Novikov cohomology groups of (M^{2n}, \omega, \theta), using and extending the technique of spectral sequences developed by Di Pietro and Vinogradov for symplectic manifolds. We discuss related results by many peoples, e.g. Bouche, Lychagin, Rumin, Tseng-Yau, in light of our spectral sequences. We calculate the primitive cohomology groups of a (2n+2)-dimensional locally conformal symplectic nilmanifold as well as those of a l.c.s. solvmanifold. We show that the l.c.s. solvmanifold is a mapping torus of a contactomorphism, which is not isotopic to the identity.
