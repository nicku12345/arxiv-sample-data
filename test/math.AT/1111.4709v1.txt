In this paper we give a combinatory proof of the Lie bialgebra structure presented in the vector space of reduced cyclic words. This structure was introduce by M. Chas in Combinatorial lie bialgebras of curves on surfaces, where the proof of the existence of this Lie bialgebra structure is based on the existence of an isomorphism between the space of reduced cyclic word and the space of curves on a surface.
