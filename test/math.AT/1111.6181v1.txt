Given an automorphism \phi:\Gamma\to \Gamma, one has an action of \Gamma on itself by \phi-twisted conjugacy, namely, g.x=gx\phi(g^{-1}). The orbits of this action are called \phi-twisted conjugacy classes. One says that \Gamma has the R_\infty-property if there are infinitely many \phi-twisted conjugacy classes for every automorphism \phi of \Gamma. In this paper we show that SL(n,\mathbb{Z}) and its congruence subgroups have the R_\infty-property. Further we show that any (countable) abelian extension of \Gamma has the R_\infty-property where \Gamma is a torsion free non-elementary hyperbolic group, or SL(n,\mathbb{Z}), Sp(2n,\mathbb{Z}) or a principal congruence subgroup of SL(n,\mathbb{Z}) or the fundamental group of a complete Riemannian manifold of constant negative curvature.
