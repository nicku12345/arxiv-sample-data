We axiomatise the theory of (\infty,n)-categories. We prove that the space of theories of (\infty,n)-categories is a B(\mathbb{Z}/2)^n. We prove that Rezk's complete Segal \Theta_n-spaces, Simpson and Tamsamani's Segal n-categories, the first author's n-fold complete Segal spaces, Kan and the first author's n-relative categories, and complete Segal space objects in any model of (\infty,n-1)-categories all satisfy our axioms. Consequently, these theories are all equivalent in a manner that is unique up to the action of (\mathbb{Z}/2)^n.
