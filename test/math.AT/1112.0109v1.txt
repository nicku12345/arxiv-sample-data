We use the methods of \cite{BM} to give a classification of 7-dimensional minimal algebras, generated in degree 1, over any field \bk of characteristic \textrm{char}(\bk)\neq 2, whose characteristic filtration has length 2. Equivalently, we classify 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras in dimension 7. This classification also recovers the real homotopy type of 7-dimensional 2-step nilmanifolds.
