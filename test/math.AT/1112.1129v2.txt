This paper confirms the following suggestion of Kontsevich. In the appropriate derived sense, an action of the framed little disks operad and a trivialization of the circle action is the same information as an action of the Deligne-Mumford-Knudsen operad. This improves an earlier result of the author and Bruno Vallette.
