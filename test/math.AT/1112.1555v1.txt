In this paper, we want to discuss the topology of the non-singular hypersurface Y^{n} with complex dimension n in a projective toric manifold X^{n+1}. When n is odd, our main results are a decomposition of Y^{n}\cong Y'\sharp \ s(S^n \times S^n)  as a connected sum of s copies of S^n \times S^n with a differential manifold Y' such that b_n (Y')=0 or 2. When n is even and the degree of Y in X is big enough, we find that Y also admits such a decomposition Y'\sharp \ s(S^n \times S^n), where Y' satisfy b_n(Y')-|sign(Y')|=b_n(X)\pm sign(H^n(X)), where sign(H^n(X)) is the signature of a certain bilinear form defined on H^n(X,\mz).
