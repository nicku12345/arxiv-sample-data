We study the topological and differentiable singularities of the configuration space C(\Gamma) of a mechanical linkage \Gamma in d-dimensional Euclidean space, defining an inductive sufficient condition to determine when a configuration is singular. We show that this condition holds for generic singularities, provide a mechanical interpretation, and give an example of a type of mechanism for which this criterion identifies all singularities.
