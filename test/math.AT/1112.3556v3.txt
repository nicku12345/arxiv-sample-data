We prove that for a fibration of simply-connected spaces of finite type F\hookrightarrow E\to B with F being positively elliptic and H^*(F,\qq) not possessing non-trivial derivations of negative degree, the base B is formal if and only if the total space E is formal. Moreover, in this case the fibration map is a formal map. As a geometric application we show that positive quaternion K\"ahler manifolds are formal and so are their associated twistor fibration maps.
