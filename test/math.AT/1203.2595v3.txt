We prove a certain 'fat hyperplane section' Weak Lefschetz-type theorem for etale cohomology of non-projective varieties, similar to a result of Goresky and MacPherson (over complex numbers). This statement easily yields certain (vast) generalizations of the 'ordinary' Weak Lefschetz and Barth's theorems in arbitrary characteristic (that do not require any stratified Morse theory for their proof).
