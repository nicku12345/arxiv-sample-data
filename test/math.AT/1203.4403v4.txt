A complex projective tower or simply a \mathbb CP-tower is an iterated complex projective fibrations starting from a point. In this paper we classify all 6-dimensional \mathbb CP-towers up to diffeomorphism, and as a consequence, we show that all such manifolds are cohomologically rigid, i.e., they are completely determined up to diffeomorphism by their cohomology rings. We also show that cohomological rigidity is not valid for 8-dimensional \mathbb CP-towers by classifying \mathbb CP^1-fibrations over \mathbb CP^3 up to diffeomorphism. As a corollary we show that such \mathbb CP-towers are diffeomorphic if they are homotopy equivalent.
