This article announces joint work with Frank Connolly and Jim Davis. We generalize our classification of pseudo-free involutions on the n-torus, by studying the action of the associated infinite group with torsion in the universal cover. Included is a non-Riemannian example obtained from the restriction of the action of a Coxeter group on a CAT(0) manifold.
