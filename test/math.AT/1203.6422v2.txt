We study the formality of the mapping torus of an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of a manifold. In particular, we give conditions under which a mapping torus has a non-zero Massey product. As an application we prove that there are non-formal compact co-symplectic manifolds of dimension m and with first Betti number b if and only if m=3 and b \geq 2, or m \geq 5 and b \geq 1. Explicit examples for each one of these cases are given.
