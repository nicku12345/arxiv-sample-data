We present a version of a proof by Andy Chermak of the existence and uniqueness of centric linking systems associated to arbitrary saturated fusion systems. This proof differs from the one by Chermak in that it is based on the computation of higher derived functors of certain inverse limits. This leads to a much shorter proof, but one which is aimed mostly at researchers familiar with homological algebra.
