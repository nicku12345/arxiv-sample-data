We study the boundary of an open smooth complex algebraic variety U. We ask when the cohomology of the geometric boundary Z=X\setminus U in a smooth compactification X is pure with respect to the mixed Hodge structure. Knowing the dimension of singularity locus of some singular compactification we give a bound for k above which the cohomology H^k(Z) is pure. The main ingredient of the proof is purity of the intersection cohomology sheaf.
