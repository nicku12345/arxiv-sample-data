Let  R=k[x_1...x_r] and M a multigraded R-module. In this work we interpret M as a multipersistent homology module and give a multigraded resolution of it. The construction involves cellular resolutions of monomial ideals and reflects the combinatorial structure of multipersistence homology modules. In the one critical case, a multifiltration is represented by a labelled cellular complex. A multipersistence homology module measures the defect of acyclicity of the associated multigraded cellular chain complex.
