The purpose of this text is the study of the class of homotopy types which are modelized by strict \infty-groupoids. We show that the homotopy category of simply connected \infty-groupoids is equivalent to the derived category in homological degree greater or equal to 2 of abelian groups. We deduce that the simply connected homotopy types modelized by strict \infty-groupoids are precisely the products of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. We also briefly study 3-categories with weak inverses. We finish by two questions about the problem suggested by the title of this text.
