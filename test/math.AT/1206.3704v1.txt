We introduce a new type of weakly enriched categories over a given symmetric monoidal model category M; these are called Co-Segal categories. Their definition derives from the philosophy of classical (enriched) Segal categories. We study their homotopy theory by giving a model structure on them. One of the motivations of introducing these structure was to have an alternative definition of higher linear categories following Segal-like methods.
