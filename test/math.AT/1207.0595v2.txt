We study the topology of the inertia space of a smooth G-manifold M where G is a compact Lie group. We construct an explicit Whitney stratification of the inertia space, demonstrating that the inertia space is a triangulable differentiable stratified space. In addition, we demonstrate a de Rham theorem for differential forms defined on the inertia space with respect to this stratification.
