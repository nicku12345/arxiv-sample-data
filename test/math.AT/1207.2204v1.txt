We present projective versions of the center point theorem and Tverberg's theorem, interpolating between the original and the so-called "dual" center point and Tverberg theorems.   Furthermore we give a common generalization of these and many other known (transversal, constraint, dual, and colorful) Tverberg type results in a single theorem, as well as some essentially new results about partitioning measures in projective space.
