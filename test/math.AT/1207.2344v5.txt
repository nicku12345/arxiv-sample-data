Our goal in this paper is to compute the integral free loop space homology of (n-1)-connected 2n-manifolds M, n\geq 2. We do this when n\neq 2,4,8, or when n\neq 2 and \tilde H^*(M) has trivial cup product squares, though the techniques used here should extend to a much wider range of manifolds. We also give partial information concerning the action of the Batalin-Vilkovisky operator.
