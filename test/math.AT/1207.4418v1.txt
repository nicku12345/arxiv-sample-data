A bundle gerbe is constructed from an oriented smooth vector bundle of even rank with a fiberwise inner product, over a compact connected orientable smooth manifold with Riemannian metric. From a trivialization of the bundle gerbe is constructed an irreducible Clifford module bundle, a spinor bundle over the smooth free loop space of the manifold.   First, a Clifford algebra bundle over the loop space is constructed from the vector bundle. A polarization class bundle is constructed, choosing continuously over each point of the loop space a polarization class of Lagrangian subspaces of the complexification of the real vector space from which the Clifford algebra is made. Being unable to choose a Lagrangian subspace continuously from the polarization class over each point, the thesis constructs a bundle gerbe over the loop space of the base manifold to encode over each loop all such subspaces, along with the isomorphisms between the Fock spaces made from them, resulting from their being in the same polarization class.   The vanishing of the Dixmier-Douady class of the bundle gerbe implies that the latter has a trivialization, from which is constructed a spinor bundle.
