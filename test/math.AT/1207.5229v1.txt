Suppose a compact torus T acts on a closed smooth manifold M. Under certain conditions, Guillemin and Zara associate to (M, T) a labeled graph \mG_M where the labels lie in H^2(BT). They also define the subring H_T^*(\mG_M) of \bigoplus_{v\in V(\mG_M)}H^*(BT), where V(\mG_M) is the set of vertices of \mG_M and we call H_T^*(\mG_M) the "graph cohomology" ring of \mG_M. It is known that the equivariant cohomology ring of M can be described by using combinatorial data of the labeled graph. The main result of this paper is to determine the ring structure of equivariant cohomology ring of a flag manifold of type G_2 directly, using combinatorial techniques on the graph \mG_M. This gives a new computation of the equivariant cohomology ring of a flag manifold of type G_2.
