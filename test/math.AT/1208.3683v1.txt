This note provides a computation of the bordism groups of K-Witt spaces for fields K with characteristic 2. We provide a complete computation for the unoriented bordism groups. For the oriented bordism groups, a nearly complete computation is provided as well a discussion of the difficulty of resolving a remaining ambiguity in dimensions equivalent to 2 mod 4. This corrects an error in the char(K)=2 case of the author's prior computation of the bordism groups of K-Witt spaces for an arbitrary field K.
