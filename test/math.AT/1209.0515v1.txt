Two simple polytopes of dimension 3 having the identical bigraded Betti numbers but non-isomorphic Tor-algebras are presented. These polytopes provide two homotopically different moment-angle manifolds having the same bigraded Betti numbers. These two simple polytopes are the first examples of polytopes that are (toric) cohomologically rigid but not combinatorially rigid.
