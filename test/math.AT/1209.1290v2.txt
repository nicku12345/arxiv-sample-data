Two of the most useful tools in topological combinatorics are the nerve lemma and discrete Morse theory. In this note we introduce a theorem that interpolates between them and allows decompositions of complexes into non-contractible pieces as long as discrete Morse theory ensures that they behave well enough. The proof is based on diagrams of spaces, but that theory is not needed for the formulation or applications of the theorem.
