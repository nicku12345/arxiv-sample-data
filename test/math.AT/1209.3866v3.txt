Using the theory of extensions of L-infinity algebras, we construct rational homotopy models for classifying spaces of fibrations, giving answers in terms of classical homological functors, namely the Chevalley-Eilenberg and Harrison cohomology. We also investigate the algebraic structure of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complexes of L-infinity algebras and show that they possess, along with the Gerstenhaber bracket, an L-infinity structure that is homotopy abelian.
