In 1974, M. Shub stated Topological Entropy Conjecture, that is, the inequality \log\rho\leq ent(f) is valid or not, where f is a continuous self-map on a compact manifold M, ent(f) is the topological entropy of f and \rho is the maximum absolute eigenvalue of f_* which is the linear transformation induced by f on the homology group H_{*}(M;\mathbb{Z})=\bigoplus\limits_{i=0}^n{H_{i}(M;\mathbb{Z})}. In 1986, A. B. Katok gave a counterexample such that the inequality \log\rho\leq ent(f) is invalid. In this paper, we define f-\v{C}ech homology group \check{H}_{i}(X,f;\mathbb{Z}) and topological fiber entropy ent(f_L) on compact Hausdorff space X for which there is n=n(J) such that \check{H}_*(X;\mathbb{Z}) exists, where f\in C^0(X) and J is the set of all covers. Then we prove that \log\rho\leq ent(f_L) is valid.
