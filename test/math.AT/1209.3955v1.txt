We prove that the universal enveloping algebra of the Lawrence-Sullivan construction is a particular perturbation of the complete Baues-Lemaire cylinder of S^0. Together with other evidences we present, this exhibits the Lawrence-Sullivan construction as the right model of I^+. From this, we also deduce a generalized Euler formula on Bernoulli numbers.
