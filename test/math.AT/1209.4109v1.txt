Let LM be the semigroup of non-degenerate based loops with a fixed initial/final frame in a Riemannian manifold M of dimension at least three. We compare the topology of LM to that of the loop space Omega FTM on the bundle of frames in the tangent bundle of M. We show that Omega FTM is the group completion of LM, and prove that it is obtained by localizing LM with respect to adding a "small twist".
