Graph maps that are homotopic to the identity and that permute the vertices are studied. Given a periodic point for such a map, a {\em rotation element} is defined in terms of the fundamental group. A number of results are proved about the rotation elements associated to periodic points in a given edge of the graph. Most of the results show that the existence of two periodic points with certain rotation elements will imply an infinite family of other periodic points with related rotation elements. These results for periodic points can be considered as generalizations of the rotation interval for degree one maps of the circle.
