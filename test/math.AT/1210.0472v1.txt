We give formulas for the number of polynomials over a finite field with given root multiplicities, in particular in cases when the formula is surprisingly simple (a power of q). Besides this concrete interpretation, we also prove an analogous result on configuration spaces in the Grothendieck ring of varieties, suggesting new homological stabilization conjectures for configuration spaces of the plane.
