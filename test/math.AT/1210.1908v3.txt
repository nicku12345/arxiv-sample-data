In this paper, we first discuss the topological properties of projective Stiefel manifolds, we compute their cohomology rings and classify their cohomology endomorphisms; Then by embedding the flag manifold of a classical Lie group into its corresponding infinite dimensional projective Stiefel manifold(which is homotopic to the product of infinite dimensional complex projective space \mathbb{C}P^{\infty}), we define the Schubert polynomials and dual Schubert polynomials. Finally we discuss the property and the computation of these polynomials.
