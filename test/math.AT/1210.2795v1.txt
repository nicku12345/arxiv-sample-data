In this paper we study the space of morphisms from a complex projective space to a compact smooth toric variety X. It is shown that the first author's stability theorem for the spaces of rational maps from CP^m to CP^n extends to the spaces of continuous morphisms from CP^m to X, essentially, with the same proof. In the case of curves, our result improves the known bounds for the stabilization dimension.
