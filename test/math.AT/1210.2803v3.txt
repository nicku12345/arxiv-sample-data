The neighborhood complexes of graphs were introduced by Lov\'asz in his proof of the Kneser conjecture. He showed that a certain topological property of N(G) gives a lower bound for the chromatic number of G.   In this paper, we study a combinatorial description of the fundamental groups of the neighborhood complexes. For a positive integer r, we introduce the r-fundamental group \pi_1^r(G,v) of a based graph (G,v) and the r-neighborhood complex N_r(G) of G. The 1-neighborhood complex is the neighborhood complex. We show that the even part \pi_1^{2r}(G,v)_{ev}, which is a subgroup of \pi_1^{2r}(G,v) with index 1 or 2, is isomorphic to the fundamental group of (N_r(G),v) if v is not isolated. We can use the r-fundamental groups to show the non-existence of graph homomorphisms. For example, we show that \pi_1^3(KG_{2k+1,k}) is isomorphic to \mathbb{Z} /2, and this implies that there is no graph homomorphism from KG_{2k+1,k} to the 5-cycle graph C_5. We discuss the covering maps associated to r-fundamental groups.
