In this paper, we want to construct a one-to-one correspondence from the set of diffeomorphism classes of spin d-twisted homology \mc P^3 to the set of isotopy classes of the embedding from S^3 to S^6, which is a generalization of the Montgomery-Yang correspondence. Furthermore, we will apply this generalized correspondence to prove the existence of free involution on these d-twisted homology \mc P^3.
