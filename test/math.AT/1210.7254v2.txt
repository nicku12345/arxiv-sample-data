We define the Coxeter cochain complex of a Coxeter group (G,S) with coefficients in a Z[G]-module A. This is closely related to the complex of simplicial cochains on the abstract simplicial complex I(S) of the commuting subsets of S. We give some representative computations of Coxeter cohomology and explain the connection between the Coxeter cohomology for groups of type A, the (singular) homology of certain configuration spaces, and the (Tor) homology of certain local Artin rings.
