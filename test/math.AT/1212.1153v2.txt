A model structure is defined on the category of derived differentiable schemes, and it is used to analyse the truncation 2-functor from derived manifolds to d-manifolds. It is proved that the induced 1-functor between the homotopy categories is full and essentially surjective, giving a bijection between the sets of equivalence classes of objects. An example is constructed, showing that this 1-functor is not faithful.
