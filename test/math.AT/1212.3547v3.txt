In this paper we review the combinatorics of the twisted sectors of \mathcal{M}_{g,n}, and we exhibit a formula for the age of each of them in terms of the combinatorial data. Then we show that orbifold cohomology of \mathcal{M}_{g,n} when g \to \infty reduces to its ordinary cohomology. We do this by showing that the twisted sector with minimal age is always the hyperelliptic twisted sector with all markings in the Weierstrass points; the age of the latter moduli space is just half its codimension in \mathcal{M}_{g,n}.
