Let X be a smooth complex algebraic variety. Morgan [Mor78] showed that the rational homotopy type of X is a formal consequence of the differential graded algebra defined by the first term of its weight spectral sequence. In the present work we generalize this result to arbitrary nilpotent complex algebraic varieties (possibly singular and/or non-compact) and to algebraic morphisms between them. The result for algebraic morphisms generalizes the Formality Theorem of [DGMS75] for compact K\"ahler varieties, filling a gap in Morgan's theory concerning functoriality over the rational numbers. As an application, we study the Hopf invariant of certain algebraic morphisms using intersection theory.
