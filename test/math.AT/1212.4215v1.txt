We generalize the methods in previous work to provide a program for proving Singer's Conjecture for Coxeter systems. Specifically, we consider even Coxeter systems with nerves that are flag triangulations of \BS^{n-1}, n=2k. We prove that Singer's Conjecture in dimensions n-2 and n-1, along with the vanishing of the \ltwo-homology of certain subspaces called "two-letter" ruins above dimension k+1, imply Singer's Conjecture in dimension n. This is, so far, an incomplete program. The author intends this paper to serve as a reference for those inquiring about Singer's Conjecture and about even Coxeter systems.
