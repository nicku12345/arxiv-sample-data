We find defining equations for the Shimura curve of discriminant 15 over Z[1/15]. We then determine the graded ring of automorphic forms over the 2-adic integers, as well as the higher cohomology. We apply this to calculate the homotopy groups of a spectrum of "topological automorphic forms" associated to this curve, as well as one associated to a quotient by an Atkin-Lehner involution.
