We show that the classical example X of a 3-dimensional generalized manifold constructed by van Kampen is another example of not homologically locally connected (i.e. not HLC) space. This space X is not locally homeomorphic to any of the compact metrizable 3-dimensional manifolds constructed in our earlier paper which are not HLC spaces either.
