In this paper, we introduce the notions of r-fundamental groups of graphs, r-covering maps, and r-neighborhood complexes of graphs for a positive integer r. There is a natural correspondence between r-covering maps and r-fundamental groups as is the case of the covering space theory in topology. We can derive obstructions of the existences of graph maps from r-fundamental groups. Especially, r-fundamental groups gives deep informations about the existences of graph maps to odd cycles. For example, we prove the Kneser graph K_{2k+1,k} has no graph maps to C_5. r-neighborhood complexes are natural generalization of neighborhood complexes defined by Lov\acute{\rm a}sz. We prove that (2r)-fundamental groups gives graph theoretical description of the fundamental groups of r-neighborhood complexes.
