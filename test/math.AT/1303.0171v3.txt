We present a new approach to equivariant version of the topological complexity, called a symmetric topological complexity. It seems that the presented approach is more adequate for the analysis of an impact of symmetry on the the motion planning algoritm than the one introduced and studied by Colman and Grant. We show many bounds for the symmetric topological complexity comparing it with already known invariants and prove that in the case of a free action it is equal to the Farber's topological complexity of the orbit space. We define the Whitehead version of it.
