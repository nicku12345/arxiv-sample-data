We prove that a graph whose chromatic number is 2 is a homotopy test graph. We also prove that there is a graph K with two involutions \gamma_1 and \gamma_2 such that (K,\gamma_1) is a Stiefel-Whitney test graph, but (K,\gamma_2) is not. These are answers to some of the problems suggested by Kozlov.
