The exterior degree of a finite group has been introduced in [P. Niroomand and R. Rezaei, On the exterior degree of finite groups, Comm. Algebra 39 (2011), 335--343] and the present paper is devoted to study the exterior degree of infinite groups. We find some inequalities of combinatorial nature, which generalize those of the finite case and allow us to get structural restrictions for the whole group.
