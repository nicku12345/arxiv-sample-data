We compute the homology of the space of equivariant loops on the classifying space of a simplicial monoid M with anti-involution, provided \pi_0 (M) is central in the homology ring of M. The proof is similar to McDuff and Segal's proof of the group completion theorem.   Then we compute the homology of the C_2-fixed points of a Segal-type model of the algebraic K-theory of an additive category with duality. As an application we show that this fixed point space is sometimes group complete, but not in general.
