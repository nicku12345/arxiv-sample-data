We construct a free resolution of R/I^s over R where I\ideal R is generated by a (finite or infinite) regular sequence. This generalizes the Koszul complex for the case s=1. For s>1, we easily deduce that the algebra structure of \Tor^R_*(R/I,R/I^s) is trivial and the reduction map R/I^s\lra R/I^{s-1} induces the trivial map of algebras.
