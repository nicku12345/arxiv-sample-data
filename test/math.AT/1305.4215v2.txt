We prove that every homomorphism from the fundamental group of a planar Peano continuum to the fundamental group of a planar or one-dimensional Peano continuum is induced by a continuous map up to conjugation.   This is then used to provide a family of uncountable many planar Peano continua with pairwise non-isomorphic fundamental groups all of which are not homotopy equivalent to a one-dimensional space.
