Suppose \Gamma is a finite group acting freely on S^{n} (n\geqslant 3 being odd) and M is any closed oriented n-manifold. We show that, given an integer k, the set \deg^{-1}(k) of based homotopy classes of mappings with degree k is finite and its cardinality depends only on the congruence class of k modulo \#\Gamma; moreover, \#\deg^{-1}(k) can be expressed in terms of the Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants of M.
