We prove several results about the vanishing of the elliptic genus on positively curved Spin manifolds with logarithmic symmetry rank. The proofs are based on the rigidity of the elliptic genus and Kennard's improvement of the Connectedness Lemma for transversely intersecting, totally geodesic submanifolds.
