Let A be a line arrangement in the complex projective plane CP2. We define and describe the inclusion map of the boundary manifold --the boundary of a close regular neighborhood of A-- in the exterior of the arrangement. We obtain two explicit descriptions of the map induced on the fundamental groups. These computations provide a new minimal presentation of the fundamental group of the complement.
