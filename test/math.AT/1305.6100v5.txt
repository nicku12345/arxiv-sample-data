We compute the mod 2 homology of the spectrum \mathrm{tmf} of topological modular forms by proving a 2-local equivalence \mathrm{tmf} \wedge DA(1) \simeq \mathrm{tmf}_1(3) \simeq BP\left \langle 2\right\rangle, where DA(1) is an eight cell complex whose cohomology "doubles" the subalgebra \mathcal{A}(1) of the Steenrod algebra generated by \mathrm{Sq}^1 and \mathrm{Sq}^2. To do so, we give, using the language of stacks, a modular description of the elliptic homology of DA(1) via level three structures. We briefly discuss analogs at odd primes and recover the stack-theoretic description of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for \mathrm{tmf}.
