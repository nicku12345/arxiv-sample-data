The embedding Chains(R) into Cochains(R) as the compactly supported cochains might lead one to expect Chains(R) to carry a nonunital commutative Frobenius algebra structure, up to a degree shift and some homotopic weakening of the axioms. We prove that under reasonable "locality" conditions, a cofibrant resolution of the dioperad controlling nonunital shifted-Frobenius algebras does act on Chains(R), and in a homotopically-unique way. But we prove that this action does not extend to a homotopy Frobenius action at the level of properads or props. This gives an example of a geometrically meaningful algebraic structure on homology that does not lift in a geometrically meaningful way to the chain level.
