In "Homotopy decomposition of classifying spaces via elementary Abelian subgroups", Stephan Jackowski and James McClure show, for functors admitting a Mackey complement over categories holding a direct product, a general result on vanishing cohomology. We develop a framework leading to a general result on trivial homotopy which partially generalizes Jackowski and McClure's result in two different directions.
