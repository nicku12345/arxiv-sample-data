Given a smooth oriented manifold M with non-empty boundary, we study the Pontryagin algebra A=H_\ast(\Omega ) where  \Omega  is the space of loops in M based at a distinguished point of  \partial M. Using the ideas of string topology of Chas-Sullivan, we define a linear map \{\{-,-\}\}: A \otimes A \to A\otimes A which is a double bracket in the sense of Van den Bergh satisfying a version of the Jacobi identity. For \dim(M)\geq 3, the double bracket \{\{-,-\}\} induces Gerstenhaber brackets in the representation algebras associated with A. This extends our previous work on the case \dim(M)=2 where A= H_0(\Omega ) is the group algebra of the fundamental group \pi_1(M) and the double bracket \{\{-,-\}\} induces the standard Poisson brackets on the moduli spaces of representations of \pi_1(M).
