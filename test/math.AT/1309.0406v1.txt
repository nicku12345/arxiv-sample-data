We show that the cyclic and epicyclic categories which play a key role in the encoding of cyclic homology and the lambda operations, are obtained from projective geometry in characteristic one over the infinite semifield F of "max-plus integers". Finite dimensional vector spaces are replaced by modules defined by restriction of scalars from the one-dimensional free module, using the Frobenius endomorphisms of F. The associated projective spaces are finite and provide a mathematically consistent interpretation of J. Tits' original idea of a geometry over the absolute point. The self-duality of the cyclic category and the cyclic descent number of permutations both acquire a geometric meaning.
