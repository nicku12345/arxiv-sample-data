In this paper, using exclusively homotopy theoretical methods, we study degrees of maps between (n-2)-connected (2n-1)-dimensional Poincar\' e complexes which have torsion free integral homology. Necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for the existence of map degrees between such Poincar\' e complexes are established.   We calculate the set of all map degrees between certain two (n-2)-connected (2n-1)-dimensional torsion free Poincar\'e complexes.   For low n, using knowledge of possible degrees of self maps, we classify, up to homotopy, torsion free (n-2)-connected (2n-1)-dimensional Poincar\' e complexes.
