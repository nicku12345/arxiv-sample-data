We construct two infinite sequences of immersions of the 3-sphere into 4-space, parameterized by the Dynkin diagrams of types A and D. The construction is based on immersions of 4-manifolds obtained as the plumbed immersions along the weighted Dynkin diagrams. We compute their Smale invariants and bordism classes of immersions by using Ekholm-Takase's formula in terms of singular Seifert surfaces. In order to construct singular Seifert surfaces for the immersions, we use the Kirby calculus.
