We show an Uhlenbeck type estimate for closed simply connected manifolds which provides the existence of certain exact sequences in K-area homology. This leads to the behavior of the K-area homology under surgery. Moreover, we give an index theoretic obstruction to positive scalar curvature on compact spin manifolds with boundary.
