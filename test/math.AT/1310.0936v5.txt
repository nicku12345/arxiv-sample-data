We characterize the double centralizer of all parabolic subgroups of the braid groups. We apply this result to provide a new and potentially more efficient solution to the subgroup conjugacy problem for parabolic subgroups. In the course of the proof we also characterize the centralizer for all parabolic subgroups.
