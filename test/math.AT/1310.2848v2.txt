In this paper we construct faithful representations of saturated fusion systems over discrete p-toral groups and use them to find conditions that guarantee the existence of unitary embeddings of p-local compact groups. These conditions hold for the Clark-Ewing and Aguad\'e-Zabrodsky p-compact groups as well as some exotic 3-local compact groups. We also show the existence of unitary embeddings of finite loop spaces.
