In this paper we prove that a simplicial map of finite-dimensional locally finite simplicial complexes has contractible point inverses if and only if it is an \epsilon-controlled homotopy equivalence for all \epsilon>0 if and only if f\times \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R} is a bounded homotopy equivalence measured in the open cone over the target. This confirms for such a space X the slogan that arbitrarily fine control over X corresponds to bounded control over the open cone O(X_+). For the proof a one parameter family of cellulations \{X_\epsilon^\prime\}_{0<\epsilon<\epsilon(X)} is constructed which provides a retracting map for X which can be used to compensate for sufficiently small control.
