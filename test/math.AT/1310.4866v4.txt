An abelian arrangement is a finite set of codimension one abelian subvarieties (possibly translated) in a complex abelian variety. In this paper, we study the cohomology of the complement of an abelian arrangement. For unimodular abelian arrangements, we provide a combinatorial presentation for a differential graded algebra whose cohomology is isomorphic to the rational cohomology of the complement. Moreover, this DGA has a bi-grading that allows us to compute the mixed Hodge numbers.
