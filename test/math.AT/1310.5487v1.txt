In the paper we treat Gale diagrams in a combinatorial way. The interpretation allows to describe simplicial complexes which are Alexander dual to boundaries of simplicial polytopes and, more generally, to nerve-complexes of general polytopes. This technique and recent results of N.Yu.Erokhovets are combined to prove the following: Buchstaber invariant s(P) of a convex polytope equals 1 if and only if P is a pyramid. In general, we describe a procedure to construct polytopes with s_R(P)>k. The construction has purely combinatorial consequences. We also apply Gale duality to the study of bigraded Betti numbers and f-vectors of polytopes.
