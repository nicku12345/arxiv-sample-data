We apply previous results on the representations of solvable linear algebraic groups to construct a new class of free divisors whose complements are K(\pi, 1)'s. These free divisors arise as the exceptional orbit varieties for a special class of "block representations" and have the structure of determinantal arrangements.   Among these are the free divisors defined by conditions for the (modified) Cholesky-type factorizations of matrices, which contain the determinantal varieties of singular matrices of various types as components. These complements are proven to be homotopy tori, as are the Milnor fibers of these free divisors. The generators for the complex cohomology of each are given in terms of forms defined using the basic relative invariants of the group representation.
