The main result of this note is an efficient presentation of the S^1-equivariant cohomology ring of Peterson varieties (in type A) as a quotient of a polynomial ring by an ideal \mathcal{J}, in the spirit of the well-known Borel presentation of the cohomology of the flag variety. Our result simplifies previous presentations given by Harada-Tymoczko and Bayegan-Harada. In particular, our result gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Bayegan and Harada that the defining ideal \mathcal{J} is generated by quadratics.
