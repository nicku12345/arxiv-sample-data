This paper presents two algorithms. In their simplest form, the first algorithm decides the existence of a pointed homotopy between given simplicial maps f, g from X to Y and the second computes the group [\Sigma X,Y]^* of pointed homotopy classes of maps from a suspension; in both cases, the target Y is assumed simply connected and the algorithms run in polynomial time when the dimension of X is fixed. More generally, these algorithms work relative to a subspace A of X, fibrewise over a simply connected B and also equivariantly when all spaces are equipped with a free action of a fixed finite group G.
