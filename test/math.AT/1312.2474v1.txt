An algorithmic computation of the set of unpointed stable homotopy classes of equivariant fibrewise maps was described in a recent paper of the author and his collaborators. In the present paper, we describe a simplification of this computation that uses an abelian heap structure on this set that was observed in another paper of the author. A heap is essentially a group without a choice of its neutral element; in addition, we allow it to be empty.
