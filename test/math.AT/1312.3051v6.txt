Box complex is a \mathbb{Z}_2-space associated to a graph, and it is known that a certain \mathbb{Z}_2-homotopy invariant of it, called the \mathbb{Z}_2-index, gives an effective lower bound for the chromatic number. On the other hand, we show that any \mathbb{Z}_2-homotopy invariant of the box complex is not equivalent to the chromatic number. Namely, we construct a graph homomorphism f:X \rightarrow Y such that it gives rise to a \mathbb{Z}_2-homotopy equivalence between their box complexes, but X and Y have different chromatic numbers. To see this, we show that some deformations of graphs do not change the \mathbb{Z}_2-simple homotopy types of box complexes.
