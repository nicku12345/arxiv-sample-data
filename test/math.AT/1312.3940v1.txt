Locally stable maps S^3\to\mathbb{R}^4 are classified up to homotopy through locally stable maps. The equivalence class of a map f is determined by three invariants: the isotopy class \sigma(f) of its framed singularity link, the generalized normal degree \nu(f), and the algebraic number of cusps \kappa(f) of any extension of f to a locally stable map of the 4-disk into \mathbb{R}^5. Relations between the invariants are described, and it is proved that for any \sigma, \nu, and \kappa which satisfy these relations, there exists a map f:S^3\to\mathbb{R}^4 with \sigma(f)=\sigma, \nu(f)=\nu, and \kappa(f)=\kappa. It follows in particular that every framed link in S^3 is the singularity set of some locally stable map into \mathbb{R}^4.
