We extend the formula for the Chern classes of blow-ups of algebraic varieties due to Porteous and Lascu-Scott, and of symplectic and complex manifolds due to Geiges and Pasquotto, to the blow-ups of almost complex manifolds. Our approach is based on a concrete partition for the tangent bundle of a blow-up. The use of topological K-theory of vector bundles simplifies the classical approaches.
