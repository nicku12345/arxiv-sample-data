We introduce characteristics into chromatic homotopy theory. This parallels the prime characteristics in number theory as well as in our earlier work on structured ring spectra and unoriented bordism theory. Here, the K(n)-local Hopkins-Miller classes \zeta_n take the places of the prime numbers, and this allows us to discuss higher bordism theories. We prove that the K(2)-localizations of the spectrum of topological modular forms as well as the string bordism spectrum have characteristic \zeta_2.
