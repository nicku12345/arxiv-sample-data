We prove Conjecture F from [VW12] which states that the complements of closures of certain strata of the symmetric power of a smooth irreducible complex variety exhibit rational homological stability. Moreover, we generalize this conjecture to the case of connected manifolds of dimension at least 2 and give an explicit homological stability range.
