We show that relative loop spaces are recognized by A_\infty-actions. A certain version of the 2-sided bar construction is used to prove such recognition theorem. The operad {\sf Act}_\infty of A_\infty-actions is presented in terms of the Boardman-Vogt resolution of the operad {\sf Act}. We exhibit an operad homotopy equivalence between such resolution and the 1-dimensional Swiss-cheese operad \mathcal{SC}_1.
