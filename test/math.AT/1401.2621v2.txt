It is well known that under mild conditions on a connected topological space \mathcal X, connected covers of \mathcal X may be classified via conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group of \mathcal X. In this paper, we extend these results to the study of immersions into 2-dimensional CW-complexes. An immersion f : {\mathcal D} \rightarrow \mathcal C between CW-complexes is a cellular map such that each point y \in {\mathcal D} has a neighborhood U that is mapped homeomorphically onto f(U) by f. In order to classify immersions into a 2-dimensional CW-complex \mathcal C, we need to replace the fundamental group of \mathcal C by an appropriate inverse monoid. We show how conjugacy classes of the closed inverse submonoids of this inverse monoid may be used to classify connected immersions into the complex.
