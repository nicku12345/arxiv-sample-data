The aim of this paper is to define a chain level refinement of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra structure on the homology of the free loop space of a closed, oriented C^\infty-manifold. For this purpose, we define a (nonsymmetric) cyclic dg operad which consists of "de Rham chains" of free loops with marked points. A notion of de Rham chains, which is a certain hybrid of the notions of singular chains and differential forms, is a key ingredient in our construction. Combined with a generalization of cyclic Deligne's conjecture, this dg operad produces a chain model of the free loop space which admits an action of a chain model of the framed little disks operad, recovering the string topology BV algebra structure on the homology level.
