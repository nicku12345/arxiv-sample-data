The neighborhood complex N(G) is a simplicial complex assigned to a graph G whose connectivity gives a lower bound for the chromatic number of G. We show that if the Kronecker double coverings of graphs are isomorphic, then their neighborhood complexes are isomorphic. As an application, for integers m and n greater than 2, we construct connected graphs G and H such that N(G) \cong N(H) but \chi(G) = m and \chi(H) = n. We also construct a graph KG_{n,k}' such that KG_{n,k}' and the Kneser graph KG_{n,k} are not isomorphic but their Kronecker double coverings are isomorphic.
