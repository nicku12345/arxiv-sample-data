In this paper, we develop the theory of equivariant motivic homotopy theory, both unstable and stable. While our original interest was in the case of profinite group actions on smooth schemes, we discuss our results in as broad a setting as possible so as to be applicable in a variety of contexts, for example to the case of smooth group scheme actions on schemes that are not necessarily smooth. We also discuss how {\mathbb A}^1-localization behaves with respect to mod-\ell-completion, where \ell is a fixed prime.
