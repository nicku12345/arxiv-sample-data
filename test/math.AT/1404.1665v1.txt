A toric arrangement is a finite collection of codimension-1 subtori in a torus. These subtori stratify the ambient torus into faces of various dimensions. Let f_i denote the number of i-dimensional faces; these so-called face numbers satisfy the Euler relation \sum_i (-1)^i f_i = 0. However not all tuples of natural numbers satisfying this relation arise as face numbers of some toric arrangement. In this paper we focus on toric arrangements in a 2-dimensional torus and obtain a characterization of face numbers. In particular we show that the convex hull of these face numbers is a cone. Finally we extend some of these results to arrangements of geodesics in surfaces of higher genus.
