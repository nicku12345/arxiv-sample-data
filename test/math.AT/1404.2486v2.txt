We provide a notion of algebraic rational cell with applications to intersection theory on singular varieties with torus action. Based on this notion, we study the algebraic analogue of \mathbb{Q}-filtrable varieties: algebraic varieties where a torus acts with isolated fixed points, such that the associated Bialynicki-Birula decomposition consists of algebraic rational cells. We show that the rational equivariant Chow group of any \mathbb{Q}-filtrable variety is freely generated by the cell closures. We apply this result to group embeddings, and more generally to spherical varieties. This paper is an extension of arxiv.org/abs/1112.0365 to equivariant Chow groups.
