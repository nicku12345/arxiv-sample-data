We study the structure of the symplectic invariant part \mathfrak{h}_{g,1}^{\mathrm{Sp}} of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{h}_{g,1} consisting of symplectic derivations of the free Lie algebra generated by the rational homology group of a closed oriented surface \Sigma_{g} of genus g.   First we describe the orthogonal direct sum decomposition of this space which is induced by the canonical metric on it and compute it explicitly up to degree 20. In this framework, we give a general constraint which is imposed on the \mathrm{Sp}-invariant component of the bracket of two elements in \mathfrak{h}_{g,1}. Second we clarify the relations among \mathfrak{h}_{g,1} and the other two related Lie algebras \mathfrak{h}_{g,*} and \mathfrak{h}_{g} which correspond to the cases of a closed surface \Sigma_g with and without base point *\in\Sigma_g. In particular, based on a theorem of Labute, we formulate a method of determining these differences and describe them explicitly up to degree 20. Third, by giving a general method of constructing elements of \mathfrak{h}_{g,1}^{\mathrm{Sp}}, we reveal a considerable difference between the two submodules of it, one is the \mathrm{Sp}-invariant part of a certain ideal \mathfrak{j}_{g,1} and the other is that of the Johnson image.   Finally we combine these results to determine the structure of \mathfrak{h}_{g,1} completely up to degree 6 including the unstable cases where the genus 1 case has an independent meaning. In particular, we see a glimpse of the Galois obstructions explicitly from our point of view.
