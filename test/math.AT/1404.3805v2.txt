We study intersection numbers of invariant divisors in the toric manifold associated with the fan determined by the collection of Weyl chambers for each root system of classical type and of exceptional type G_2. We give a combinatorial formula for intersection numbers of certain subvarieties which are naturally indexed by elements of the Weyl group. These numbers describe the ring structure of the cohomology of the toric manifold.
