The hammock localization provides a model for a homotopy function complex in any Quillen model category. We prove that a homotopy between a pair of morphisms induces a homotopy between the maps induced by taking the hammock localization. We describe applications of this fact to the study of homotopy algebras over monads and homotopy idempotent functors. Among other things, we prove that, under Vop\v{e}nka's principle, every homotopy idempotent functor in a cofibrantly generated model category is determined by simplicial orthogonality with respect to a set of morphisms. We also give a new proof of the fact that left Bousfield localizations with respect to a class of morphisms always exist in any left proper combinatorial model category under Vop\v{e}nka's principle.
