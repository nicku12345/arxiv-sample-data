The first example of a compact manifold admitting both complex and symplectic structures but not admitting a K\"ahler structure is the renowned Kodaira-Thurston manifold. We review its construction and show that this paradigm is very general and is not related to the fundamental group. More specifically, we prove that the simply-connected 8-dimensional compact manifold of [\textsc{M. Fern\'{a}ndez and V. Mu\~{n}oz}, \emph{An 8-dimensional non-formal simply connected symplectic manifold}, Ann. of Math. (2) \textbf{167}, no. 3, 1045--1054, 2008.] admits both symplectic and complex structures but does not carry K\"ahler metrics.
