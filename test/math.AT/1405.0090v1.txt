Let \varphi\colon\Gamma\to G be a homomorphism of groups. In this paper we introduce the notion of a subnormal map (the inclusion of a subnormal subgroup into a group being a basic prototype). We then consider factorizations \Gamma\xrightarrow{\psi} M\xrightarrow{n} G of \varphi, with n a subnormal map. We search for a universal such factorization. When \Gamma and G are finite we show that such universal factorization exists: \Gamma\to\Gamma_{\infty}\to G, where \Gamma_{\infty} is a hypercentral extension of the subnormal closure \mathcal{C} of \varphi(\Gamma) in G (i.e.~the kernel of the extension \Gamma_{\infty}\to {\mathcal C} is contained in the hypercenter of \Gamma_{\infty}). This is closely related to the a relative version of the Bousfield-Kan \mathbb{Z}-completion tower of a space. The group \Gamma_{\infty} is the inverse limit of the normal closures tower of \varphi introduced by us in a recent paper. We prove several stability and finiteness properties of the tower and its inverse limit \Gamma_{\infty}.
