Let n be a positive integer, and let \ell>1 be square-free odd. We classify the set of equivariant homeomorphism classes of free C_\ell-actions on the product S^1 \times S^n of spheres, up to indeterminacy bounded in \ell. The description is expressed in terms of number theory.   The techniques are various applications of surgery theory and homotopy theory, and we perform a careful study of h-cobordisms. The \ell=2 case was completed by B Jahren and S Kwasik (2011). The new issues for the case of \ell odd are the presence of nontrivial ideal class groups and a group of equivariant self-equivalences with quadratic growth in \ell. The latter is handled by the composition formula for structure groups of A Ranicki (2009).
