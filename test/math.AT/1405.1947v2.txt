In this paper we study the Haefliger invariant for long embeddings \mathbb{R}^{4k-1}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{6k} in terms of the self-intersections of their projections to \mathbb{R}^{6k-1}, under the condition that the projection is a generic long immersion \mathbb{R}^{4k-1}\looparrowright\mathbb{R}^{6k-1}. We define the notion of "crossing changes" of the embeddings at the self-intersections and describe the change of the isotopy classes under crossing changes using the linking numbers of the double point sets in \mathbb{R}^{4k-1}. This formula is a higher-dimensional analogue to that of X.-S. Lin and Z. Wang for the order 2 invariant for classical knots. As a consequence, we show that the Haefliger invariant is of order two in a similar sense to Birman and Lin. We also give an alternative proof for the result of M. Murai and K. Ohba concerning "unknotting numbers" of embeddings \mathbb{R}^3\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^6. Our formula enables us to define an invariant for generic long immersions \mathbb{R}^{4k-1}\looparrowright\mathbb{R}^{6k-1} which are liftable to embeddings \mathbb{R}^{4k-1}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{6k}. This invariant corresponds to V. Arnold's plane curve invariant in Lin-Wang theory, but in general our invariant does not coincide with order 1 invariant of T. Ekholm.
