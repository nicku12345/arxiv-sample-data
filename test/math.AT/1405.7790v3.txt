In a paper published in 2002, the author gave a criterion to determine whether there is a fiber-preserving branched covering between two given orientable Seifert manifolds with orientable bases. Here we supply some details of the proof of two claims in that paper. We give an explicit construction of fiber-preserving branched covering between two Seifert fibered solid tori when their Seifert invariants satisfy certain relation, and we show the factorability of fiber-preserving branched coverings between two closed Seifert manifolds.
