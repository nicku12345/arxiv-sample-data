Let n \geq 2. We prove a homological stability theorem for the diffeomorphism groups of (4n+1)-dimensional manifolds, with respect to forming the connected sum with (2n-1)-connected, (4n+1)-dimensional manifolds that are stably parallelizable. Our techniques involve the study of the action of the diffeomorphism group of a manifold M, on the linking form associated to the homology groups of M. In particular, we construct a geometric model for the linking form using the intersections of embedded and immersed \mathbb{Z}/k-manifolds. In addition to our main homological stability theorem, we prove several disjunction results for the embeddings and immersions of \mathbb{Z}/k-manifolds that could be of independent interest.
