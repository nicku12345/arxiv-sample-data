Let n be a fixed positive integer and h: \{1,2,...,n\} \rightarrow \{1,2,...,n\} a Hessenberg function. The main result of this manuscript is to give a systematic method for producing an explicit presentation by generators and relations of the equivariant and ordinary cohomology rings (with \mathbb{Q} coefficients) of any regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety \mathrm{Hess}(h) in type A. Specifically, we give an explicit algorithm, depending only on the Hessenberg function h, which produces the n defining relations \{f_{h(j),j}\}_{j=1}^n in the equivariant cohomology ring. Our result generalizes known results: for the case h=(2,3,4,...,n,n), which corresponds to the Peterson variety \mathrm{Pet}_n, we recover the presentation of H^*_S(\mathrm{Pet}_n) given previously by Fukukawa, Harada, and Masuda. Moreover, in the case h=(n,n,...,n), for which the corresponding regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety is the full flag variety \mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n), we can explicitly relate the generators of our ideal with those in the usual Borel presentation of the cohomology ring of \mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n). The proof of our main theorem includes an argument that the restriction homomorphism H^*_T(\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n)) \to H^*_S(\mathrm{Hess}(h)) is surjective. In this research announcement, we briefly recount the context and state our results; we also give a sketch of our proofs and conclude with a brief discussion of open questions. A manuscript containing more details and full proofs is forthcoming.
