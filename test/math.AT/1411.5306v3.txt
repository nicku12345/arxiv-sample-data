We give a tool for understanding simplicial desuspension in A1-algebraic topology: we show that X \to \Omega (S^1 \wedge X)\to \Omega (S^1 \wedge X \wedge X) is a fiber sequence up to homotopy in 2-localized A1-algebraic topology for X = (S^1)^m \wedge G_m^{\wedge q} with m>1. It follows that there is an EHP sequence spectral sequence Z_{(2)} \otimes \pi_{n+1+i}^{A1} (S^{2n+2m+1} \wedge (G_m)^{\wedge 2q}) \Rightarrow Z_{(2)} \otimes \pi_{i}^{A1, s} (S^{m} \wedge (G_m)^{\wedge q}).
