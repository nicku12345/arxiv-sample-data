We classify closed, topological spin^+ 4-manifolds with fundamental group \pi of cohomological dimension \leq 3 (up to s-cobordism), after stabilization by connected sum with at most b_3(\pi) copies of S^2\times S^2. In general we must also assume that \pi also satisfies certain K-theory and assembly map conditions. Examples for which these conditions hold include the torsion-free fundamental groups of 3-manifolds and all right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs have no 4-cliques.
