In the first part, this paper studies the characteristic rank of the canonical oriented k-plane bundle over the Grassmann manifold SO(n)/(SO(k) \times SO(n-k)) of oriented k-planes in Euclidean n-space. It presents infinitely many new exact values if k = 3 or k = 4, as well as new lower bounds for the number in question if k > 4. In the second part, these results enable us to improve on the general upper bounds for the Z/2Z-cup-length of SO(n)/(SO(k) \times SO(n-k)). In particular, for SO(2^t)/(SO(3) \times SO(2^t-3)) (with t > 2) we prove that the cup-length is equal to 2^t-3, which verifies the corresponding claim of Tomohiro Fukaya's conjecture from 2008.
