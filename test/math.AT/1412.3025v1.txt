This article deals with the notion of factorability. Elements of a factorable group or monoid possess a normal form, which leads to a small complex homotopy equivalent to its bar complex, thus computing its homology. We investigate the relations to string rewriting and to discrete Morse theory on the bar complex. Furthermore, we describe a connection between factorability and Garside theory.
