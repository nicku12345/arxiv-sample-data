We describe the second homotopy group of any CW-complex K by analyzing the universal cover of a locally finite model of K using the notion of G-coloring of a partially ordered set. As applications we prove a generalization of the Hurewicz theorem, which relates the homotopy and homology of non-necessarily simply-connected complexes, and derive new results on asphericity for two-dimensional complexes and group presentations.
