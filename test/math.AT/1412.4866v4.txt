The polyhedral product constructed from a collection of pairs of cones and their bases and a simplicial complex K is studied by investigating its filtration called the fat wedge filtration. We give a sufficient condition for decomposing the polyhedral product in terms of the fat wedge filtration of the real moment-angle complex for K, which is a desuspension of the decomposition of the suspension of the polyhedral product due to Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen, and Gitler. We show that the condition also implies a strong connection with the Golodness of K, and is satisfied when K is dual sequentially Cohen-Macaulay over \mathbb{Z} or \lceil\frac{\dim K}{2}\rceil-neighborly so that the polyhedral product decomposes. Specializing to moment-angle complexes, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for their decomposition and co-H-structures in terms of their fat wedge filtration.
