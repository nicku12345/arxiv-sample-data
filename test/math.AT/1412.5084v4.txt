We construct a new family of toric manifolds generating the unitary bordism ring. Each manifold in the family is the complex projectivisation of the sum of a line bundle and a trivial bundle over a complex projective space. We also construct a family of special unitary quasitoric manifolds which contains polynomial generators of the special unitary bordism ring with 2 inverted in dimensions >8. Each manifold in the latter family is obtained from an iterated complex projectivisation of a sum of line bundles by amending the complex structure to make the first Chern class vanish.
