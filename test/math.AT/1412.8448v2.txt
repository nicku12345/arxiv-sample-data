A fibration of {\mathbb R}^n by oriented copies of {\mathbb R}^p is called skew if no two fibers intersect nor contain parallel directions. Conditions on p and n for the existence of such a fibration were given by Ovsienko and Tabachnikov. A classification of smooth fibrations of {\mathbb R}^3 by skew oriented lines was given by Salvai, in analogue with the classification of oriented great circle fibrations of S^3 by Gluck and Warner. We show that Salvai's classification has a topological variation which generalizes to characterize all continuous fibrations of {\mathbb R}^n by skew oriented copies of {\mathbb R}^p. We show that the space of fibrations of {\mathbb R}^3 by skew oriented lines deformation retracts to the subspace of Hopf fibrations, and therefore has the homotopy type of a pair of disjoint copies of S^2. We discuss skew fibrations in the complex and quaternionic setting and give a necessary condition for the existence of a fibration of {\mathbb C}^n ({\mathbb H}^n) by skew oriented copies of {\mathbb C}^p ({\mathbb H}^p).
