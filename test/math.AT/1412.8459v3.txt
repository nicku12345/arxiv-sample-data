We introduce simple models for associative algebras and bimodules in the context of non-symmetric \infty-operads, and use these to construct an (\infty,2)-category of associative algebras, bimodules, and bimodule homomorphisms in a monoidal \infty-category. By working with \infty-operads over \Delta^{n,\text{op}} we iterate these definitions and generalize our construction to get an (\infty,n+1)-category of E_{n}-algebras and iterated bimodules in an E_{n}-monoidal \infty-category. Moreover, we show that if \mathcal{C} is an E_{n+k}-monoidal \infty-category then the (\infty,n+1)-category of E_{n}-algebras in \mathcal{C} has a natural E_{k}-monoidal structure. We also identify the mapping (\infty,n)-categories between two E_{n}-algebras, which allows us to define interesting non-connective deloopings of the Brauer space of a commutative ring spectrum.
