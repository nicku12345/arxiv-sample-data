New identity similar to an identity of [13] for fractional integrals have been defined. Then making use of this identity, some new Ostrowski type inequalities for Riemann-Liouville fractional integral have been developed. Our results have some relationships with the results of Alomari et. al., proved in [13] [published in. Appl. Math. Lett. 23 (2010) 1071-1076] and the analysis used in the proofs is simple.
