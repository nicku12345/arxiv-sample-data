In this paper we continue to study {\it quasi associated homogeneous distributions \rm{(}generalized functions\rm{)}} which were introduced in the paper by V.M. Shelkovich, Associated and quasi associated homogeneous distributions (generalized functions), J. Math. An. Appl., {\bf 338}, (2008), 48-70. [arXiv:math/0608669]. For the multidimensional case we give the characterization of these distributions in the terms of the dilatation operator U_{a} (defined as U_{a}f(x)=f(ax), x\in \bR^n, a >0) and its generator \sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}. It is proved that f_k\in {\cD}'(\bR^n) is a quasi associated homogeneous distribution of degree \lambda and of order k if and only if \bigl(\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}-\lambda\bigr)^{k+1}f_{k}(x)=0, or if and only if \bigl(U_a-a^\lambda I\bigr)^{k+1}f_k(x)=0, \forall \, a>0, where I is a unit operator. The structure of a quasi associated homogeneous distribution is described.
