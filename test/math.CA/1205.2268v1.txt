The aim of this paper is to establish an analogue of Logvinenko-Sereda's theorem for the Fourier-Bessel transform (or Hankel transform) \ff_\alpha of order \alpha>-1/2. Roughly speaking, if we denote by PW_\alpha(b) the Paley-Wiener space of L^2-functions with Fourier-Bessel transform supported in [0,b], then we show that the restriction map f\to f|_\Omega is essentially invertible on PW_\alpha(b) if and only if \Omega is sufficiently dense. Moreover, we give an estimate of the norm of the inverse map. As a side result we prove a Bernstein type inequality for the Fourier-Bessel transform.
