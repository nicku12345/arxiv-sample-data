Let L^{m,p}(\R^n) be the Sobolev space of functions with m^{th} derivatives lying in L^p(\R^n). Assume that n< p < \infty. For E \subset \R^n, let L^{m,p}(E) denote the space of restrictions to E of functions in L^{m,p}(\R^n). We show that there exists a bounded linear map T : L^{m,p}(E) \rightarrow L^{m,p}(\R^n) such that, for any f \in L^{m,p}(E), we have Tf = f on E. We also give a formula for the order of magnitude of \|f\|_{L^{m,p}(E)} for a given f : E \rightarrow \R when E is finite.
