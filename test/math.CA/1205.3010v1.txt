We show that the family of m-dimensional isotropic projections in \R^{2n} is transversal. As an application we show that the Besicovitch-Federer projection theorem holds for isotropic projections. We also use transversality to obtain almost sure estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of isotropic projections of subsets E \subset \R^{2n}. These results may also be applied to gain information on the horizontal projections of the Heisenberg group \H^n.
