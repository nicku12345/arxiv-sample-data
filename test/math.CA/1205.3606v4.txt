We introduce a notion of (finite order) lacunarity in higher dimensions for which we can bound the associated directional maximal operators in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n), with p>1. In particular, we are able to treat the classes previously considered by Nagel--Stein--Wainger, Sj\"ogren--Sj\"olin and Carbery. Closely related to this, we find a characterisation of the sets of directions which give rise to bounded maximal operators. The bounds enable Lebesgue type differentiation of integrals in L_{\text{loc}}^p(\mathbb{R}^n), replacing balls by tubes which point in these directions.
