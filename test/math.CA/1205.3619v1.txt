We use Sadavoskii's fixed point method to investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions of Caputo impulsive fractional differential equations of order \alpha between 0 and 1 with one example of impulsive logistic model and few other examples as well. We also discuss Caputo impulsive fractional differential equations with finite delay. The results proven are new and complement the existing one.
