An analogue of D. Waterman's result on the summability of the Fourier series for functions of bounded \Lambda-variation by the Ces\'aro methods of negative order is obtained in multidimensional case. It is proved that, unlike one-dimensional case, the continuity of function in the corresponding variation is essential for the convergence and even for the localization of the Ces\'aro means for certain orders of these means.
