We prove that Calder\'on-Zygmund operators, Marcinkiewicz operators, maximal operators associated to Bochner-Riesz operators, operators with rough kernel as well as commutators associated to these operators which are known to be bounded on weighted Morrey spaces under appropriate conditions, are bounded on a wide family of function spaces.
