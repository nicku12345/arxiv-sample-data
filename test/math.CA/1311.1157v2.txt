We determine the optimal majorant M^+ and minorant M^- of exponential type for the truncation of x\mapsto (x^2+a^2)^{-1} with respect to general de Branges measures. We prove that \[ \int_\mathbb{R} (M^+ - M^-) |E(x)|^{-2}dx = \frac{1}{a^2 K(0,0)} \] where K is the reproducing kernel for \mathcal{H}(E). As an application we determine the optimal majorant and minorant for the Heaviside function that vanish at a fixed point \alpha = ia on the imaginary axis. We show that the difference of majorant and minorant has integral value (\pi a - \tanh(\pi a))^{-1} \pi a.
