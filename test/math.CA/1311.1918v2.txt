We consider the original strategy proposed by Sudakov for solving the Monge transportation problem with norm cost |\cdot|_{D^*} \[ \min \bigg\{\int |\mathtt T(x) - x|_{D^*} d\mu(x), \ \mathtt T : \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R^d, \ \nu = \mathtt T_\# \mu \bigg\}, \] with \mu, \nu probability measures in \mathbb R^d and \mu absolutely continuous w.r.t. \mathcal L^d. The key idea in this approach is to decompose (via disintegration of measures) the Kantorovich optimal transportation problem into a family of transportation problems in Z_\mathfrak a\times\mathbb R^d, where \{Z_\mathfrak a\}_{\mathfrak a\in\mathfrak A} \subset \mathbb R^d are disjoint regions such that the construction of an optimal map \mathtt T_\mathfrak a : Z_\mathfrak a \to \mathbb R^d is simpler than in the original problem, and then to obtain \mathtt T by piecing together the maps \mathtt T_\mathfrak a. In this paper we show how the original idea of Sudakov can be successfully implemented. The results yield a complete characterization of the Kantorovich optimal transportation problem, whose straightforward corollary is the solution of the Monge problem in each set Z_\mathfrak a and then in \mathbb R^d. The strategy is sufficiently powerful to be applied to other optimal transportation problems.
