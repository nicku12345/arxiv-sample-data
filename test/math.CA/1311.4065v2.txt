We introduce a notion of localization for dyadic functions, i.e. functions defined on the Cantor group. Localization is characterized by functional UC_d similar to the Heisenberg uncertainty constant used for real-line functions. We are looking for dyadic analogs of quantitative uncertainty principles. To justify definition we use some test functions including dyadic scaling and wavelet functions.
