The purpose of this paper is to describe a unified approach to proving vector-valued inequalities without relying on the full strength of weighted theory. Our applications include the Fefferman-Stein and Cordoba-Fefferman inequalities, as well as the vector-valued Carleson operator. Using this approach we also produce a proof of the boundedness of the classical bi-parameter multiplier operators, that does not rely on product theory. Our arguments are inspired by the vector valued restricted type interpolation used in [1].
