A set \mathcal{A}\subset C[0,1] is \emph{shy} or \emph{Haar null } (in the sense of Christensen) if there exists a Borel set \mathcal{B}\subset C[0,1] and a Borel probability measure \mu on C[0,1] such that \mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{B} and \mu\left(\mathcal{B}+f\right) = 0 for all f \in C[0,1]. The complement of a shy set is called a \emph{prevalent} set. We say that a set is \emph{Haar ambivalent} if it is neither shy nor prevalent.   The main goal of the paper is to answer the following question: What can we say about the topological properties of the level sets of the prevalent/non-shy many f\in C[0,1]?   The classical Bruckner--Garg Theorem characterizes the level sets of the generic (in the sense of Baire category) f\in C[0,1] from the topological point of view. We prove that the functions f\in C[0,1] for which the same characterization holds form a Haar ambivalent set.   In an earlier paper we proved that the functions f\in C[0,1] for which positively many level sets with respect to the Lebesgue measure \lambda are singletons form a non-shy set in C[0,1]. The above result yields that this set is actually Haar ambivalent. Now we prove that the functions f\in C[0,1] for which positively many level sets with respect to the occupation measure \lambda\circ f^{-1} are not perfect form a Haar ambivalent set in C[0,1].   We show that for the prevalent f\in C[0,1] for the generic y\in f([0,1]) the level set f^{-1}(y) is perfect.   Finally, we answer a question of Darji and White by showing that the set of functions f \in C[0,1] for which there exists a perfect P_f\subset [0,1] such that f'(x) = \infty for all x \in P_f is Haar ambivalent.
