In this paper we investigate the properties of the set of T-periodic solutions of semi-explicit parametrized Differential-Algebraic Equations with non-autonomous constraints of a particular type. We provide simple, degree theoretic conditions for the existence of branches of T-periodic solutions of the considered equations. Our approach is based on topological arguments about differential equations on implicitly defined manifolds, combined with elementary facts of matrix analysis.
