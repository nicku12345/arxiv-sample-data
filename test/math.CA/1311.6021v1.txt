It is of course well known that the usual definitions of Riemann integration and Riemann integrals are equivalent to simpler definitions which can be expressed in terms of just one sequence of partitions, using dyadic intervals or dyadic squares or dyadic cubes for univariate, double, or triple integrals respectively. These lecture notes, intended mainly for undergraduates, present and prove some basic standard results of Riemann integration in detail, taking advantage of this simpler definition. The last section of the notes provides a proof of the equivalence of this definition with the classical one. But the implicit suggestion is that the classical definition need be the concern of specialists only, and that regular students can probably do just about everything that they need to do with Riemann integration by working only with the simpler dyadic definition. This is a preliminary version of these notes which will surely be updated later. It is very difficult to believe that there do not exist any other documents which give a systematic treatment of Riemann integration using this approach. The author would be very grateful for any information about any such documents.
