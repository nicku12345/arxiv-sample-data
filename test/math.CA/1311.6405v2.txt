The play operator minimalizes the total variation on intervals [0,T], T> 0, of functions approximating uniformly given regulated function with given accuracy and starting from a given point. In this article we link the play operator with so called truncated variation functionals, introduced recently by the second-named author, and provide a semi-explicit expression for the play operator in terms of these functionals. Generalisation for time-dependent boundaries is also considered. This gives the best possible lower bounds for the total variation of the outputs of the play operator and its Jordan-like decomposition.
