Call a pair (s,t) \in [0,d] \times [0,d] admissible, if there exists a compact set K \subset \mathbb{R}^{d} and a constant C > 0 such that 0 < \mathcal{H}^{s}(K) < \infty, and \mathcal{H}_{s}(K \cap T) \leq Cw(T)^{t} for all tubes T \subset \mathbb{R}^{d} of width w(T). The purpose of this paper is to show that all pairs (s,s) with s < 1 are admissible. Combined with previous results, this settles a question of A. Carbery.
