In this paper, we show that Hilbert transforms along some curves are bounded on L^p({\mathbb R}^n;X) for some 1<p<\infty and some UMD spaces X. In particular, we prove that the Hilbert transform along some curves are completely L^p-bounded in the terminology from operator space theory. Moreover, we obtain the L^p(\mathbb{R}^n;X)-boundedness of anisotropic singular integrals by using the "method of rotations" of Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund.   All these results extend the existing related ones.
