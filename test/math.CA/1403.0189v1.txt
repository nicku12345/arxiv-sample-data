In this paper, we study some properties of the q-Appell polynomials, including the recurrence relations and the q-difference equations which extend some known calssical (q=1) results. We also provide the recurrence relations and the q-difference equations for q-Bernoulli polynomials, q-Euler polynomials, q-Genocchi polynomials and for newly defined q-Hermite polynomials, as special cases of q-Appell polynomials
