C. Muscalu, J. Pipher, T. Tao and C. Thiele proved in \cite{MPTT1} that the standard bilinear and bi-parameter Hilbert transform does not satisfy any L^{p} estimates. They also raised a question asking if a bilinear and bi-parameter multiplier operator defined by    T_{m}(f_{1},f_{2})(x):=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{4}}m(\xi,\eta)\hat{f_{1}}(\xi_{1},\eta_{1})\hat{f_{2}}(\xi_{2},\eta_{2})e^{2\pi ix\cdot((\xi_{1},\eta_{1})+(\xi_{2},\eta_{2}))}d\xi d\eta  satisfies any L^p estimates, where the symbol m satisfies    |\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}\partial_{\eta}^{\beta}m(\xi,\eta)|\lesssim\frac{1}{dist(\xi,\Gamma_{1})^{|\alpha|}}\cdot\frac{1}{dist(\eta,\Gamma_{2})^{|\beta|}}  for sufficiently many multi-indices \alpha=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}) and \beta=(\beta_{1},\beta_{2}), \Gamma_{i} (i=1,2) are subspaces in \mathbb{R}^{2} and dim \, \Gamma_{1}=0, \, dim \, \Gamma_{2}=1. P. Silva answered partially this question in \cite{S} and proved that T_{m} maps L^{p_1}\times L^{p_2}\rightarrow L^{p} boundedly when \frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}=\frac{1}{p} with p_1, p_2>1, \frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{2}{p_2}<2 and \frac{1}{p_2}+\frac{2}{p_1}<2. One observes that the admissible range here for these tuples (p_1,p_2,p) is a proper subset contained in the admissible range of BHT.   In this paper, we establish the same L^{p} estimates as BHT in the full range for the bilinear and multi-parameter Hilbert transforms with arbitrary symbols satisfying appropriate decay assumptions (Theorem 1.3). Moreover, we also establish the same L^p estimates as BHT for certain modified bilinear and bi-parameter Hilbert transforms with dim \, \Gamma_{1}=dim \, \Gamma_{2}=1 but with a slightly better decay than that for the bilinear and bi-parameter Hilbert transform (Theorem 1.4).
