For a Banach space B of functions which satisfies for some m>0  \max(\|F+G\|_B,\|F-G\|_B) \ge (\|F\|^s_B + m\|G\|^s_B)^{1/s}, \forall F,G\in B \ (*)  a significant improvement for lower estimates of the moduli of smoothness \omega^r(f,t)_B is achieved. As a result of these estimates, sharp Jackson inequalities which are superior to the classical Jackson type inequality are derived. Our investigation covers Banach spaces of functions on R^d or T^d for which translations are isometries or on S^{d-1} for which rotations are isometries. Results for C_0 semigroups of contractions are derived. As applications of the technique used in this paper, many new theorems are deduced. An L_p space with 1<p<\infty  satisfies (*) where s=\max(p,2), and many Orlicz spaces are shown to satisfy (*) with appropriate s.
