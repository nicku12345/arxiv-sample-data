Employing the generalized Parseval equality for the Mellin transform and elementary trigonometric formulas, the iterated Hartley transform on the nonnegative half-axis (the iterated half-Hartley transform) is investigated in L_2. Mapping and inversion properties are discussed, its relationship with the iterated Stieltjes transform is established. Various compositions with the Fourier cosine and sine transforms are obtained. The results are applied to the uniqueness and universality of the closed form solutions for certain new singular integral and integro-functional equations.
