In this paper, we study asymptotic stability of the zero solution of a class of differential systems governed by a scalar differential inequality with time-varying structures and delays. We establish a new generalized Halanay inequality for the asymptotic stability of the zero solution for such systems under more relaxed conditions than the existing ones. We also apply the theoretical results to the analysis of self synchronization in networks of delayed differential systems and obtained a more general sufficient condition for self synchronization.
