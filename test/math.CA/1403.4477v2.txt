The paper provides a complement to the classical results on Fourier multipliers on L^p spaces. In particular, we prove that if q\in (1,2) and a function m:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} is of bounded q-variation uniformly on the dyadic intervals in \mathbb{R}, i.e. m\in V_q(\mathcal{D}), then m is a Fourier multiplier on L^p(\mathbb{R}, wdx) for every p\geq q and every weight w satisfying Muckenhoupt's A_{p/q}-condition. We also obtain a higher dimensional counterpart of this result as well as of a result by E. Berkson and T.A. Gillespie including the case of the V_q(\mathcal{D}) spaces with q>2. New weighted estimates for modified Littlewood-Paley functions are also provided.
