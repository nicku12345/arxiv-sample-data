We characterize the spectrum of positive linear operators T:X \to Y, where X and Y are complex Banach function spaces with unit 1, having finite rank and a partition of unity property. Then all the points in the spectrum are eigenvalues of T and \sigma_p(T) \subset B(0,1) \cup \{1\}. The main result is that 1 is the only eigenvalue on the unit circle, the peripheral spectrum of T.
