We obtain exact for order estimates of best uniform approximations and uniform approximations by Fourier sums of classes of convolutions the periodic functions belong to unit balls of spaces L_{p}, \ {1\leq p<\infty}, with generating kernel \Psi_{\beta}, whose absolute values of Fourier coefficients \psi(k) are such that \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi^{p'}(k)k^{p'-2}<\infty, \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p'}=1, and product \psi(n)n^{\frac{1}{p}} can't tend to nought faster than power functions.
