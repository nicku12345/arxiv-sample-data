Let \{Q^{(\alpha)}_{n,\lambda}\}_{n\geq 0} be the sequence of monic orthogonal polynomials with respect the Gegenbauer-Sobolev inner product \langle f,g\rangle_{S}:=\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)g(x)(1-x^{2})^{\alpha-\frac{1}{2}}dx+\lambda \int_{-1}^{1}f'(x)g'(x)(1-x^{2})^{\alpha-\frac{1}{2}} dx, where \alpha>-\frac{1}{2} and \lambda\geq 0. In this paper we use a recent result due to B.D. Bojanov and N.   Naidenov \cite{BN2010}, in order to study the maximization of a local extremum of the kth derivative \frac{d^k}{dx^k}Q^{(\alpha)}_{n,\lambda} in [-M_{n,\lambda}, M_{n,\lambda}], where   M_{n,\lambda} is a suitable value such that all zeros of the polynomial Q^{(\alpha)}_{n,\lambda} are contained in [-M_{n,\lambda}, M_{n,\lambda}] and the function \left|Q^{(\alpha)}_{n,\lambda}\right| attains its maximal value at the end-points of such interval. Also, some illustrative numerical examples are presented.
