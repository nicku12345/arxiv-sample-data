An asymptotic expansion for the generalised quadratic Gauss sum S_N(x,\theta)=\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp (\pi ixj^2+2\pi ij\theta), where x, \theta are real and N is a positive integer, is obtained as x\rightarrow 0 and N\rightarrow\infty such that Nx is finite. The form of this expansion holds for all values of Nx+\theta and, in particular, in the neighbourhood of integer values of Nx+\theta. A simple bound for the remainder in the expansion is derived. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the expansion and the sharpness of the bound.
