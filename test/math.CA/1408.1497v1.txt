In this paper, new sharp weighted generalizations of Ostrowski and generalized trapezoid type inequalities for the Riemann--Stieltjes integrals are proved. Several related inequalities are deduced and investigated. New Simpson's type inequalities for \mathcal{RS}--integral are pointed out. Finally, as application; an error estimation of a general quadrature rule for \mathcal{RS}--integral via Ostrowski--generalized trapezoid quadrature formula is given.
