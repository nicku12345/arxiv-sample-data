We show that for multivariate Freud-type weights W_\alpha(x)=\exp(-|x|^\alpha), \alpha>1, any convex function f on R^d satisfying fW_\alpha\in L_p(R^d) if 1\le p<\infty, or \lim_{|x|\to\infty}f(x)W_\alpha(x)=0 if p=\infty, can be approximated in the weighted norm by a sequence P_n of algebraic polynomials convex on R^d such that \|(f-P_n)W_\alpha\|_{L_p(R^d)}\to0 as n\to\infty. This extends the previously known result for d=1 and p=\infty obtained by the first author to higher dimensions and integral norms using a completely different approach.
