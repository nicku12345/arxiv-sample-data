We prove that for p\in (0,1], the double inequality% \begin{equation*} \tfrac{1}{3p^{2}}\cos px+1-\tfrac{1}{3p^{2}}<\frac{\sin x}{x}<\tfrac{1}{% 3q^{2}}\cos qx+1-\tfrac{1}{3q^{2}} \end{equation*}% holds for x\in (0,\pi /2) if and only if 0<p\leq p_{0}\approx 0.77086 and \sqrt{15}/5=p_{1}\leq q\leq 1. While its hyperbolic version holds for % x>0 if and only if 0<p\leq p_{1}=\sqrt{15}/5 and q\geq 1. As applications, some more accurate estimates for certain mathematical constants are derived, and some new and sharp inequalities for Schwab-Borchardt mean\ and logarithmic means are established.
