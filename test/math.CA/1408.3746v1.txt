We study the symmetry/asymmetry of functions providing sharp constants in the embedding theorems {\stackrel{\circ}{W}}\vphantom{W}_2^r(-1,1)\hookrightarrow{\stackrel{\circ}{W}}\vphantom{W}_\infty^k(-1,1) for various r and k. The sharp constants for all r>k in the cases k=4 and k=6 are calculated explicitly as well.
