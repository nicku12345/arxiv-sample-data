We improve on several mixed weak type inequalities both for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function and for Calder\'on-Zygmund operators. These type of inequalities were considered by Muckenhoupt and Wheeden and later on by Sawyer estimating the L^{1, \infty}(uv) norm of v^{-1}T(fv) for special cases. The emphasis is made in proving new and more precise quantitative estimates involving the A_p or A_\infty constants of the weights involved.
