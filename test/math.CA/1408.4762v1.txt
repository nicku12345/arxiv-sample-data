In this paper, the generalized fractional operators involving Appell's function F_3 in the kernel due to Marichev-Saigo-Maeda are applied to the generalized K-Wright function. These fractional operators when applied to power multipliers of the generalized K-Wright function {}_{p}\Psi^k_q yields a higher ordered generalized K-Wright function, namely, {}_{p+3}\Psi^k_{q+3}. The Caputo-type modification of Marichev-Saigo-Maeda fractional differentiation is introduced and the corresponding assertions for Saigo and Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional operators are also presented. The results derived in this paper generalize several recent results in the theory of special functions.
