We provide a near-complete classification of the Lorentz spaces \Lambda_{\varphi} for which the sequence \{S_{n}\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}} of partial Fourier sums is almost everywhere convergent along lacunary subsequences. Moreover, under mild assumptions on the fundamental function \varphi, we identify \Lambda_{\varphi}:= L\log\log L\log\log\log\log L as the \emph{largest} Lorentz space on which the lacunary Carleson operator is bounded as a map to L^{1,\infty}. In particular, we disprove a conjecture stated by Konyagin in his 2006 ICM address. Our proof relies on a newly introduced concept of a "Cantor Multi-tower Embedding," a special geometric configuration of tiles that can arise within the time-frequency tile decomposition of the Carleson operator. This geometric structure plays an important role in the behavior of Fourier series near L^1, being responsible for the unboundedness of the weak-L^1 norm of a "grand maximal counting function" associated with the mass levels.
