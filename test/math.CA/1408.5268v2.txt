We obtain convergent inverse factorial expansions for the sum S_n(a,b;c) of the first n terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function of unit argument valid for n\geq 1. The form of these expansions depends on the location of the parametric excess s:=c-a-b in the complex s-plane. The leading behaviour as n\rightarrow\infty agrees with previous results in the literature. The case a=b=1/2, c=1 corresponds to the Landau contants.
