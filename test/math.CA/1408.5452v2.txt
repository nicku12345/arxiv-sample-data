Among other things, we prove that, for a doubling weight w, 0< p\leq\infty, r\in{\mathbb N}_0, and 0<\alpha <r+1 - 1/\lambda_p, we have \[ E_n(f)_{p, w_n} = O(n^{-\alpha}) \iff \omega_\varphi^{r+1}(f, n^{-1})_{p, w_n} = O(n^{-\alpha}), \] where \lambda_p := p if 0 < p < \infty, \lambda_p :=1 if p=\infty, \|f\|_{p,w} := \left( \int_{-1}^1 |f(u)|^p w(u) du \right)^{1/p}, \|f\|_{\infty,w} := {\mathop{\rm ess\: sup}\nolimits}_{u\in [-1,1]} \left(|f(u)| w(u)\right), \omega_\varphi^r(f, t)_{p, w} := \sup_{0<h\leq t} \| \Delta_{h\varphi(\cdot)}^r(f,\cdot)\|_{p, w}, E_n(f)_{p, w} := \inf_{P_n\in\Pi_n} \|f-P_n\|_{p,w}, and \Pi_n is the set of all algebraic polynomials of degree \leq n-1.   Equivalence type results involving related K-functionals and realization type results (obtained as corollaries of our estimates) are also discussed.   Finally, we mention that (*) closes a gap left in the paper by G. Mastroianni and V. Totik "Best Approximation and moduli of smoothness for doubling weights", J. Approx. Theory {\bf 110} (2001), 180-199, where (\ast) was established for p=\infty and \omega_\varphi^{r+2} instead of \omega_\varphi^{r+1} (it was shown there that, in general, (\ast) is not valid for p=\infty if \omega_\varphi^{r+1} is replaced by \omega_\varphi^{r}).
