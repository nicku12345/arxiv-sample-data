Let \omega_\varphi^k(f,\delta)_{w,L_q} be the Ditzian-Totik modulus with weight w, M^k be the cone of k-monotone functions on (-1,1), i.e., those functions whose kth divided differences are nonnegative for all selections of k+1 distinct points in (-1,1), and denote E (X, \Pi_n)_{w,q} := \sup_{f\in X} \inf_{P\in\Pi_n}\|w(f-P)\|_{L_q}, where \Pi_n is the set of algebraic polynomials of degree at most n. Additionally, let w_{\alpha,\beta}(x) := (1+x)^\alpha (1-x)^\beta be the classical Jacobi weight, and denote by S_p^{\alpha,\beta} the class of all functions such that \| w_{\alpha,\beta}f\|_{L_p}=1.   In this paper, we determine the exact behavior (in terms of \delta) of \sup_{f\in S_p^{\alpha,\beta}\cap M^k} \omega_\varphi^k(f,\delta)_{w_{\alpha,\beta},L_q} for 1\leq p, q\leq \infty (the interesting case being q<p as expected) and \alpha,\beta >-1/p (if p<\infty) or \alpha,\beta\geq 0 (if p=\infty). It is interesting to note that, in one case, the behavior is different for \alpha=\beta=0 and for (\alpha,\beta)\neq (0,0). Several applications are given. For example, we determine the exact (in some sense) behavior of E (M^k\cap S_p^{\alpha,\beta}, \Pi_n)_{w_{\alpha,\beta},L_q} for \alpha,\beta \geq 0.
