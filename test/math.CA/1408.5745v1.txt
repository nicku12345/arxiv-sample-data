The effect of Marichev-Saigo-Maeda (MSM) fractional operators involving third Appell function on the I function is studied. It is shown that the order of the I-function increases on application of these operators to the power multiple of the I-function. The Caputo-type MSM fractional derivatives are introduced and studied for the I-function. As special cases, the corresponding assertions for Saigo and Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional operators are also presented. The results obtained in this paper generalize several known results obtained recently in the literature.
