In this paper necessary and sufficient conditions are deduced for the close-to-convexity of some special combinations of Bessel functions of the first kind and their derivatives by using a result of Shah and Trimble about transcendental entire functions with univalent derivatives and some newly discovered Mittag-Leffler expansions for Bessel functions of the first kind.
