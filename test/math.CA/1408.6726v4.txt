We introduce a constructive method that provides the local solution of general implicit systems in arbitrary dimension via Hamiltonian type equations. A variant of this approach constructs parametrizations of the manifold, extending the usual implicit functions solution. We also discuss the critical case of the implicit functions theorem, define the notion of generalized solution and prove existence and properties. Examples are also indicated. The applications concern necessary conditions and algorithms in nonconvex optimization problems and their perturbations.
