We prove matching direct and inverse theorems for (algebraic) polynomial approximation with doubling weights w having finitely many zeros and singularities (i.e., points where w becomes infinite) on an interval and not too ``rapidly changing'' away from these zeros and singularities. This class of doubling weights   is rather wide and, in particular, includes the classical Jacobi weights, generalized Jacobi weights and generalized Ditzian-Totik weights.   We approximate in the weighted L_p (quasi) norm \|f\|_{p, w} with 0<p<\infty, where \|f\|_{p, w} := \left(\int_{-1}^1 |f(u)|^p w(u) du \right)^{1/p}. Equivalence type results involving related realization functionals are also discussed.
