This paper presents a new proof of the results regarding the continuity of weighted estimates with respect to the characteristic of the weight. Here we first prove the result in the dyadic case which is "easier" and then by the use of the Bellman function technique we pass to the continuous setting which is harder in general. To be more precise, as far as we know, this passage from the Martingale transform to the Hilbert transform described in this note is new.
