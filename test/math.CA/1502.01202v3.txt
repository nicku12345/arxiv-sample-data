Type I Hermite--Pad\'e polynomials for a set of functions f_0, f_1, ..., f_s at infinity, Q_{n,0}, Q_{n,1}, ..., Q_{n,s}, is defined by the asymptotic condition  R_n(z):=\bigl(Q_{n,0}f_0+Q_{n,1}f_1+Q_{n,2}f_2+...+Q_{n,s}f_s\bigr)(z) =\mathcal O (\frac1{z^{s n+s}}), \quad z\to\infty,  with the degree of all Q_{n,k}\leq n. We describe an approach for finding the asymptotic zero distribution of these polynomials as n\to \infty under the assumption that all f_j's are semiclassical, i.e. their logarithmic derivatives are rational functions. In this situation R_n and Q_{n,k}f_k satisfy the same differential equation with polynomials coefficients.   We discuss in more detail the case when f_k's are powers of the same function f (f_k=f^k); for illustration, the simplest non trivial situation of s=2 and f having two branch points is analyzed in depth. Under these conditions, the ratio or comparative asymptotics of these polynomials is also discussed.   From methodological considerations and in order to make the situation clearer, we start our exposition with the better known case of Pad\'e approximants (when s=1).
