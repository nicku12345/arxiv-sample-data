We study subsets of \R^{d} which are thin for doubling measures or isotropic doubling measures. We show that any subset of \R^{d} with Hausdorff dimension less than or equal to d-1 is thin for isotropic doubling measures. We also prove that a self-affine set that satisfies OSCH (open set condition with holes) is thin for isotropic doubling measures. For doubling measures, we prove that Bara\'nski carpets are thin for doubling measures.
