In this paper, we prove that the double inequality \begin{equation*} 1+\alpha r'^2<\frac{\mathcal{K}_{a}(r)}{\sin(\pi a)\log(e^{R(a)/2}/r')}<1+\beta r'^2 \end{equation*} holds for all a\in (0, 1/2] and r\in (0, 1) if and only if \alpha\leq \pi/[R(a)\sin(\pi a)]-1 and \beta\geq a(1-a), where r'=\sqrt{1-r^2}, \mathcal{K}_{a}(r) is the generalized elliptic integral of the first kind and R(x) is the Ramanujan constant function. Besides, as the key tool, the series expression for the Ramanujan constant function R(x) is given.
