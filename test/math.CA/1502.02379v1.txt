Orthogonal polynomials and expansions are studied for the weight function h_\kappa^2(x) \|x\|^{2\nu} (1-\|x\|^2)^{\mu-1/2} on the unit ball of \mathbb{R}^d, where h_\kappa is a reflection invariant function, and for related weight function on the simplex of \mathbb{R}^d. A concise formula for the reproducing kernels of orthogonal subspaces is derived and used to study summability of the Fourier orthogonal expansions.
