Okamoto's one-parameter family of self-affine functions F_a: [0,1]\to[0,1], where 0<a<1, includes the continuous nowhere differentiable functions of Perkins (a=5/6) and Bourbaki/Katsuura (a=2/3), as well as the Cantor function (a=1/2). The main purpose of this article is to characterize the set of points at which F_a has an infinite derivative. We compute the Hausdorff dimension of this set for the case a\leq 1/2, and estimate it for a>1/2. For all a, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the sets of points where: (i) F_a'=0; and (ii) F_a has neither a finite nor an infinite derivative. The upper and lower densities of the digit 1 in the ternary expansion of x\in[0,1] play an important role in the analysis, as does the theory of \beta-expansions of real numbers.
