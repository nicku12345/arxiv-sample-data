The derivatives with respect to order {\nu} for the Bessel functions of argument x (real or complex) are studied. Representations are derived in terms of integrals that involve the products pairs of Bessel functions, and in turn series expansions are obtained for these integrals. From the new integral representations, asymptotic approximations involving Airy functions are constructed for the order derivatives, for {\nu} large and uniformly valid for unbounded positive real x.
