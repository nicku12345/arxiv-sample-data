We give a simple proof of the fact that there exist measures on the real line of discrete support, whose Fourier Transform is also a measure of discrete support, yet this Fourier pair cannot be constructed by repeatedly applying the Poisson Summation Formula finitely many times. More specifically the support of both the measure and its Fourier Tranform are not contained in a finite union of arithmetic progressions.
