The purpose of this short article is to prove some potential estimates that naturally arise in the study of subelliptic Sobolev inequalites for functions. This will allow us to prove a local subelliptic Sobolev inequality with the optimal amount of smoothing, as well as a variant of that which describes quantitatively an improvement of the inequality as one gets away from certain characteristic varieties.
