This paper deals with approximation properties of the newly defined q-generalization of the Bal\'{a}zs-Szabados operators in the case q\geq1. Quantitative estimates of the convergence and Voronovskaja type theorem are given. In particular, it is proved that the rate of approximation by the q-Bal\'{a}zs-Szabados (q>1) is of order q^{-n} versus 1/n for the classical Bal\'{a}zs-Szabados (q=1) operators. The results are new even for the classical case q=1.
