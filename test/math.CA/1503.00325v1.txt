We introduce the notion of (\mathcal F,p)-valent functions. We concentrate in our investigation on the case, where \mathcal F is the class of polynomials of degree at most s. These functions, which we call (s,p)-valent functions, provide a natural generalization of p-valent functions (see~\cite{Ha}). We provide a rather accurate characterizing of (s,p)-valent functions in terms of their Taylor coefficients, through "Taylor domination", and through linear non-stationary recurrences with uniformly bounded coefficients. We prove a "distortion theorem" for such functions, comparing them with polynomials sharing their zeroes, and obtain an essentially sharp Remez-type inequality in the spirit of~\cite{Y3} for complex polynomials of one variable. Finally, based on these results, we present a Remez-type inequality for (s,p)-valent functions.
