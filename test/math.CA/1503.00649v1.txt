A simple proof is given for the explicit formula which allows one to recover a C^2-smooth vector field A=A(x) in \mathbb{R}^3, decaying at infinity, from the knowledge of its \nabla \times A and \nabla \cdot A. The representation of A as a sum of the gradient field and a divergence-free vector fields is derived from this formula. Similar results are obtained for a vector field in a bounded C^2-smooth domain.
