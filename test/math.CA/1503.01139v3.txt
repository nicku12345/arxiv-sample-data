Let f and g be real-valued continuous injections defined on a non-empty real interval I, and let (X, \mathscr{L}, \lambda) and (Y, \mathscr{M}, \mu) be probability spaces in each of which there is at least one measurable set whose measure is strictly between 0 and 1.   We say that (f,g) is a (\lambda, \mu)-switch if, for every \mathscr{L} \otimes \mathscr{M}-measurable function h: X \times Y \to \mathbf{R} for which h[X\times Y] is contained in a compact subset of I, it holds  f^{-1}\!\left(\int_X f\!\left(g^{-1}\!\left(\int_Y g \circ h\;d\mu\right)\right)d \lambda\right)\! = g^{-1}\!\left(\int_Y g\!\left(f^{-1}\!\left(\int_X f \circ h\;d\lambda\right)\right)d \mu\right)\!,  where f^{-1} is the inverse of the corestriction of f to f[I], and similarly for g^{-1}.   We prove that this notion is well-defined, by establishing that the above functional equation is well-posed (the equation can be interpreted as a permutation of generalized means and raised as a problem in the theory of decision making under uncertainty), and show that (f,g) is a (\lambda, \mu)-switch if and only if f = ag + b for some a,b \in \mathbf R, a \ne 0.
