Using direct variational method we consider the existence of non-spurious solutions to the following Dirichlet problem \ddot{x}\left( t\right) =f\left( t,x\left( t\right) \right) , x\left( 0\right) =x\left( 1\right) =0  where f:\left[ 0,1\right] \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} is a jointly continuous function convex in x which does not need to satisfy any further growth conditions.
