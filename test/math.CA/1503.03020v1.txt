In the paper, the authors establish three kinds of double inequalities for the trigamma function in terms of the exponential function to powers of the digamma function. These newly established inequalities extend some known results. The method in the paper utilizes some facts from the asymptotic theory and is a natural way to solve problems for approximating some quantities for large values of the variable.
