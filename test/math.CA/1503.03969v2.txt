It is well-known that the reproducing kernel of the space of spherical harmonics of fixed homogeneity is given by a Gegenbauer polynomial. By going over to complex variables and restricting to suitable bihomogeneous subspaces, one obtains a reproducing kernel expressed as a Jacobi polynomial, which leads to Koornwinder's celebrated result on the addition formula.   In the present paper, the space of Hermitian monogenics, which is the space of polynomial bihomogeneous null-solutions of a set of two complex conjugated Dirac operators, is considered. The reproducing kernel for this space is obtained and expressed in terms of sums of Jacobi polynomials. This is achieved through use of the underlying Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{sl}(1|2), combined with the equivalence between the L^2 inner product on the unit sphere and the Fischer inner product. The latter also leads to a new proof in the standard Dirac case related to the Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}(1|2).
