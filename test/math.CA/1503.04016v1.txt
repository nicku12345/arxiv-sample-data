We consider the generalised Beta function introduced by Chaudhry {\it et al.\/} [J. Comp. Appl. Math. {\bf 78} (1997) 19--32] defined by \[B(x,y;p)=\int_0^1 t^{x-1} (1-t)^{y-1} \exp \left[\frac{-p}{4t(1-t)}\right]\,dt,\] where \Re (p)>0 and the parameters x and y are arbitrary complex numbers. The asymptotic behaviour of B(x,y;p) is obtained when (i) p large, with x and y fixed, (ii) x and p large, (iii) x, y and p large and (iv) either x or y large, with p finite. Numerical results are given to illustrate the accuracy of the formulas obtained.
