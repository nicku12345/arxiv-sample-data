We study the periodic and the Neumann boundary value problems associated with the second order nonlinear differential equation \begin{equation*} u'' + c u' + \lambda a(t) g(u) = 0, \end{equation*} where g \colon \mathopen{[}0,+\infty\mathclose{[}\to \mathopen{[}0,+\infty\mathclose{[} is a sublinear function at infinity having superlinear growth at zero. We prove the existence of two positive solutions when \int_{0}^{T} a(t) \!dt < 0 and \lambda > 0 is sufficiently large. Our approach is based on Mawhin's coincidence degree theory and index computations.
