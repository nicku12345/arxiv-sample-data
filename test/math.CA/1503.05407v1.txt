In this work, we give the power series solutions around an ordinary point, in the case of variable coefficients, homogeneous sequential linear conformable fractional differential equations of order 2\alpha. Further, we introduce the conformable fractional Hermite differential equations, conformable fractional Hermite polynomials and basic properties of these polynomials.
