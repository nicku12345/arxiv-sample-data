This paper is dedicated to present an exact solution for a nonlinear differential equation so-called Abel equation. This equation was known as one of the group of unsolvable differential equations. The present method is applicable for any arbitrary form of nonlinear coefficients of Abel equation. On the other hands, the presented solution in this paper is verified with exact solution for some restricted forms of Abel equation that has been reported by Polyanin and Zaytsev [5]. Also, numerical solution is utilized to verify this method. All verifications have approved that the present method is strongly reliable and exact to solve Abel equation, analytically.
