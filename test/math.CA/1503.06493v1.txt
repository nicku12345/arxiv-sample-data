In this paper, we study the dyadic Carleson Embedding Theorem in the matrix weighted setting. We provide two new proofs of this theorem, which highlight connections between the matrix Carleson Embedding Theorem and both maximal functions and H^1-BMO duality. Along the way, we establish boundedness results about new maximal functions associated to matrix A_2 weights and duality results concerning H^1 and BMO sequence spaces in the matrix setting. As an application, we then use this Carleson Embedding Theorem to show that if S is a sparse operator, then the operator norm of S on L^2(W) satisfies: \[ \| S\|_{L^2(W) \rightarrow L^2(W)} \lesssim [W]_{A_2}^{\frac{3}{2}},\] for every matrix A_2 weight W.
