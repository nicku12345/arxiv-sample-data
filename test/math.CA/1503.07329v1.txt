We consider the asymptotic expansion of the sum \[S_p(a;w)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-w}\e^{-an^p}\] as a\rightarrow 0 in |\arg\,a|<\pi/2 for arbitrary finite p> and w>0. Our attention is concentrated mainly on the case when p and w are both even integers, where the expansion consists of a {\it finite} algebraic expansion together with a sequence of increasingly subdominant exponential expansions. This exponentially small component produces a transformation for S_p(a;w) analogous to the well-known Poisson-Jacobi transformation for the sum with p=2 and w=0. Numerical results are given to illustrate the accuracy of the expansion obtained.
