In this paper we obtain a new set of metamorphoses of the oscillating Q-system by using the Euler's integral. We split the final state of mentioned metamorphoses into three distinct parts: the signal, the noise and finally appropriate error term. We have also proved that the set of distinct metamorphoses of that class is infinite one.
