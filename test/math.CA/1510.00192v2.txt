We investigate the integral \[\int_0^\infty \cosh^\mu\!t\,K_\nu(z\cosh t)\,dt \qquad \Re(z)>0,\] where K denotes the modified Bessel function, for non-negative integer values of the parameters \mu and \nu. When the integers are of different parity, closed-form expressions are obtained in terms of z^{-1}e^{-z} multiplied by a polynomial in z^{-1} of degree dependent on the sign of \mu-\nu.
