Solution of fractional differential equations is an emerging area of present day research because such equations arise in various applied fields. In this paper we have developed analytical method to solve the system of fractional differential equations in-terms of Mittag-Leffler function and generalized Sine and Cosine functions, where the fractional derivative operator is of Jumarie type. The use of Jumarie type fractional derivative, which is modified Rieman-Liouvellie fractional derivative, eases the solution to such fractional order systems. The use of this type of Jumarie fractional derivative gives a conjugation with classical methods of solution of system of linear integer order differential equations, by usage of Mittag-Leffler and generalized trigonometric functions. The ease of this method and its conjugation to classical method to solve system of linear fractional differential equation is appealing to researchers in fractional dynamic systems. Here after developing the method, the algorithm is applied in physical system of fractional differential equation. The analytical results obtained are then graphically plotted for several examples for system of linear fractional differential equation.
