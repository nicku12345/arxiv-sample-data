As an extension to the Laplace and Sumudu transforms the classical Natural transform was proposed to solve certain fluid flow problems. In this paper, we investigate q-analogues of the q-Natural transform of some special functions. We derive the q-analogues of the q-integral transform and further apply to some general special functions such as : the exponential functions, the q-trigonometric functions, the q-hyperbolic functions and the Heaviside Function. Some further results involving convolutions and differentiations are also obtained.
