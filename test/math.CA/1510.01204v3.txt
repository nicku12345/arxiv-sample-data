Integro-differential methods, currently exploited in calculus, provide an inexhaustible source of tools to be applied to a wide class of problems, involving the theory of special functions and other subjects. The use of integral transforms of the Borel type and the associated formalism is shown to be a very effective mean, constituting a solid bridge between umbral and operational methods. We merge these different points of view to obtain new and efficient analytical techniques for the derivation of integrals of special functions and the summation of associated generating functions as well.
