The aim of this paper is to study differential properties of orthogonal polynomials with respect to a discrete Jacobi-Sobolev bilinear form with mass point at -1 and/or +1. In particular, we construct the orthogonal polynomials using certain Casorati determinants. Using this construction, we prove that when the Jacobi parameters \alpha and \beta are nonnegative integers the Jacobi-Sobolev orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of a differential operator of finite order (which will be explicitly constructed). Moreover, the order of this differential operator is explicitly computed in terms of the matrices which define the discrete Jacobi-Sobolev bilinear form.
