Using Casorati determinants of Hahn polynomials (h_n^{\alpha,\beta,N})_n, we construct for each pair \F=(F_1,F_2) of finite sets of positive integers polynomials h_n^{\alpha,\beta,N;\F}, n\in \sigma _\F, which are eigenfunctions of a second order difference operator, where \sigma _\F is certain set of nonnegative integers, \sigma _\F \varsubsetneq \NN. When N\in \NN and \alpha, \beta, N and \F satisfy a suitable admissibility condition, we prove that the polynomials h_n^{\alpha,\beta,N;\F} are also orthogonal and complete with respect to a positive measure (exceptional Hahn polynomials). By passing to the limit, we transform the Casorati determinant of Hahn polynomials into a Wronskian type determinant of Jacobi polynomials (P_n^{\alpha,\beta})_n. Under suitable conditions for \alpha, \beta and \F, these Wronskian type determinants turn out to be exceptional Jacobi polynomials.
