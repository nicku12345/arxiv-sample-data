The bivariate series \theta (q,x):=\sum _{j=0}^{\infty}q^{j(j+1)/2}x^j defines a {\em partial theta function}. For fixed q (|q|<1), \theta (q,.) is an entire function. We prove a property of stabilization of the coefficients of the Laurent series in q of the zeros of \theta. These series are of the form -q^{-j}+(-1)^jq^{j(j-1)/2}(1+\sum _{k=1}^{\infty}g_{j,k}q^k). The coefficients of the stabilized series are expressed by the positive integers r_k giving the number of partitions into parts of three different kinds. They satisfy the recurrence relation r_k=\sum _{\nu =1}^{\infty}(-1)^{\nu -1}(2\nu +1)r_{k-\nu (\nu +1)/2}. Set (H_{m,j})~:~(\sum _{k=0}^{\infty}r_kq^k) (1-q^{j+1}+q^{2j+3}-\cdots +(-1)^{m-1}q^{(m-1)j+m(m-1)/2})= \sum _{k=0}^{\infty}\tilde{r}_{k;m,j}q^k. Then for k\leq (m+2j)(m+1)/2-1-j and j\geq (2m-1+\sqrt{8m^2+1})/2 one has g_{j,k}=\tilde{r}_{k;m,j}.
