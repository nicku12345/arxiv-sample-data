It is well known that a continuously differentiable function is monotone in an interval [a,b] if and only if its first derivative does not change its sign there. We prove that this is equivalent to requiring that the Caputo derivatives of all orders \alpha \in (0,1) with starting point a of this function do not have a change of sign there. In contrast to what is occasionally conjectured, it not sufficient if the Caputo derivatives have a constant sign for a few values of \alpha \in (0,1) only.
