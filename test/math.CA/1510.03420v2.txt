In this work we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a genus 0 entire function f(z) has only positive zeros by applying Hausdorff moment problem and Mergelyan's theorem, the obtained criterion is very much reminiscent of Xian-Jin Li's criterion on the Riemann hypothesis. We also apply this criterion to the Riemann hypothesis and the generalized Riemann hypothesis for certain Dirichlet L-series of real primitive characters.
