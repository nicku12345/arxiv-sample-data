In this paper, the authors establish some inequalities involving the q-extension of the classical Gamma function. These inequalities provide bounds for certain ratios of the q-extended Gamma function. The procedure makes use of geometric convexity and monotonicy properties of certain functions associated with the q-extended Gamma function.
