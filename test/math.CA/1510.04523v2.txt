In this work we show that an n-dimensional Borel set in Euclidean N-space with finite integral Menger curvature is n-rectifiable, meaning that it can be covered by countably many images of Lipschitz continuous functions up to a null set in the sense of Hausdorff measure. This generalises L\'{e}ger's rectifiability result for one-dimensional sets to arbitrary dimension and co-dimension. In addition, we characterise possible integrands and discuss examples known from the literature.   Intermediate results of independent interest include upper bounds of different versions of P. Jones's \beta-numbers in terms of integral Menger curvature without assuming lower Ahlfors regularity, in contrast to the results of Lerman and Whitehouse.
