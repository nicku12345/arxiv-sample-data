We characterize all pairs (\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}) of generalized Riemann differences for which \mathcal{A}-differentiability implies \mathcal{B}-differentiability. Two generalized Riemann derivatives \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} are equivalent if a function has a derivative in the sense of \mathcal{A} at a real number x if and only if it has a derivative in the sense of \mathcal{B} at x. We determine the equivalence classes for this equivalence relation.
