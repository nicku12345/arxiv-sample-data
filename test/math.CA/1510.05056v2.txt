A central question in geometric measure theory is whether geometric properties of a set translate into analytical ones. In 1960, E. R. Reifenberg proved that if an n-dimensional subset M of \mathbb{R}^{n+k} is well approximated by n-planes at every point and at every scale, then M is a locally bi-H\"older image of an n-plane. Since then, Reifenberg's theorem has been refined in several ways in order to ensure that M is a bi-Lipschitz image of an n-plane. In this paper, we show that a Carleson condition on the oscillation of the unit normal of an n-Ahlfors regular rectifiable subset M of \mathbb{R}^{n+1} satisfying a Poincar\'e-type inequality is sufficient to prove that M is contained inside a bi-Lipschitz image of an n-dimensional affine subspace of \mathbb{R}^{n+1}. We also show that this Poincar\'e-type inequality encodes geometrical information about M, namely it implies that M is quasiconvex.
