We re-examine the asymptotic expansion of the Struve function {\bf H}_\nu(z) for large complex values of \nu and z satisfying |\arg\,\nu|\leq\pi/2 and |\arg\,z|<\pi/2. Watson's analysis covers only the case of \nu and z of the same phase with \nu/z in the intervals (0,1) and (1,\infty). The domains in the complex \nu/z-plane where the expansion takes on different forms are obtained.
