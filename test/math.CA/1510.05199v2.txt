We consider generalized Bochner-Riesz multipliers of the form (1-\rho(\xi))_+^{\lambda} where \rho:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R} belongs to a class of rough distance functions homogeneous with respect to a nonisotropic dilation group. We prove a critical L^4 estimate for the associated square function, which we use to derive multiplier theorems for multipliers of the form m\circ\rho where m:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}.
