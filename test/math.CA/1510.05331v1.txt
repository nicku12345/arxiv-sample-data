In this paper we investigate weighted norm inequalities for the commutator of a fractional integral operator and multiplication by a function. In particular, we show that, for \mu,\lambda\in A_{p,q} and \alpha/n+1/q=1/p, the norm \| [b,I_\alpha]:L^p(\mu^p)\to L^q(\lambda^q) \| is equivalent to the norm of b in the weighted BMO space BMO(\nu), where \nu=\mu\lambda^{-1}. This work extends some of the results on this topic existing in the literature, and continues a line of investigation which was initiated by Bloom in 1985 and was recently developed further by the first author, Lacey, and Wick.
