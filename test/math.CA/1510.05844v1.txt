Summability methods for ultraholomorphic classes in sectors, defined in terms of a strongly regular sequence \mathbb{M}=(M_p)_{p\in\mathbb{N}_0}, have been put forward by A. Lastra, S. Malek and the second author (Summability in general Carleman ultraholomorphic classes, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 430 (2015), 1175--1206). We study several open questions related to the existence of kernels of summability constructed by means of analytic proximate orders. In particular, we give a simple condition that allows us to associate a proximate order with a strongly regular sequence. Under this assumption, and through the characterization of strongly regular sequences in terms of so-called regular variation, we show that the growth index \gamma(\mathbb{M}) defined by V.Thilliez (Division by flat ultradifferentiable functions and sectorial extensions, Results Math. 44 (2003), 169--188) and the order of quasianalyticity \omega(\mathbb{M}) introduced by the second author (Flat functions in Carleman ultraholomorphic classes via proximate orders, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 415 (2014), no. 2, 623--643) are the same.
