In the present paper we consider the following Satisfaction Problem of Consumers Demands (SPCD): {\it The supplier must supply the measurable system of the measure m_k to the k-th consumer at time t_k for 1 \le k \le n. The measure of the supplied measurable system is changed under action of some dynamical system, What is a minimal measure of measurable system which must take the supplier at the initial time t=0 to satisfy demands of all consumers ?} In this paper we consider Satisfaction Problem of Consumers Demands measured by ordinary "Lebesgue measures" in R^{\infty} for various dynamical systems in R^{\infty}. In order to solve this problem we use Liouville type theorems for them which describes the dependence between initial and resulting measures of the entire system.
