The fundamental theorem in the theory of the uniform convergence of sine series is due to Chaundy and Jolliffe from 1916 (see [1]). Several authors gave conditions for this problem supposing that coefficients are monotone, non-negative or more recently, general monotone (see [8], [6] and [3], for example). There are also results for the regular convergence of double sine series to by uniform in case the coefficients are monotone or general monotone double sequences. In this article we give new sufficient conditions for the uniformity of the regular convergence of double sine series, which are necessary as well in case the coefficients are non-negative. We shall generalize those results defining a new class of double sequences for the coefficients.
