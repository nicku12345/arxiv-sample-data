A paper is devoted to study of one class of space mappings which are more general than mappings with bounded distortion. It is showed that a locally uniformly limit of a sequence of mappings f:D\rightarrow {\Bbb R}^n of domain D\subset{\Bbb R}^n, n\geqslant 2, satisfying one inequality with respect to p-modulus of families of curves, is light. The above statement is a generalization of well-known theorem about openness and discreteness of uniformly limit of a sequence of mappings with bounded distortion.
