We consider the minimal energy problem on the unit sphere \mathbb S^2 in the Euclidean space \mathbb R^3 immersed in an external field Q, where the charges are assumed to interact via Newtonian potential 1/r, r being the Euclidean distance. The problem is solved by finding the support of the extremal measure, and obtaining an explicit expression for the equilibrium density. We then apply our results to the external field generated by a point charge, and a quadratic external field.
