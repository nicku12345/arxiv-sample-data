The article arXiv:1309.0945 by Do and Thiele develops a theory of Carleson embeddings in outer L^p spaces for the wave packet transform of functions in  L^p(\mathbb R), in the 2\leq p\leq \infty range referred to as local L^2. In this article, we formulate a suitable extension of this theory to exponents 1<p<2, answering a question posed in arXiv:1309.0945. The proof of our main embedding theorem involves a refined multi-frequency Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition. We apply our embedding theorem to recover the full known range of L^p estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transforms without reducing to discrete model sums or appealing to generalized restricted weak-type interpolation.
