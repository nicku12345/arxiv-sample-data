This paper first shows that the Riemann localisation property holds for the Fourier-Laplace series partial sum for sufficiently smooth functions on the two-dimensional sphere, but does not hold for spheres of higher dimension. By Riemann localisation on the sphere \mathbb{S}^{d}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d+1}, d\ge2, we mean that for a suitable subset X of \mathbb{L}_{p}(\mathbb{S}^{d}), 1\le p\le \infty, the \mathbb{L}_{p}-norm of the Fourier local convolution of f\in X converges to zero as the degree goes to infinity. The Fourier local convolution of f at \boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{S}^{d} is the Fourier convolution with a modified version of f obtained by replacing values of f by zero on a neighbourhood of \boldsymbol{x}. The failure of Riemann localisation for d>2 can be overcome by considering a filtered version: we prove that for a sphere of any dimension and sufficiently smooth filter the corresponding local convolution always has the Riemann localisation property. Key tools are asymptotic estimates of the Fourier and filtered kernels.
