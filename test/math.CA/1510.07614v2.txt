This paper regroups some of the basic properties of Lipschitz maps and their flows. Many of the results presented here are classical in the case of smooth maps. We prove them here in the Lipschitz case for a better understanding of the Lipschitz geometry and for a quantification of the related properties, which would be of use to the development of numerical methods for rough paths for example. We also introduce the notion of almost Lipschitz maps, which provide a sharper control and description of flows of Lipschitz vector fields and local inverses of Lipschitz injective immersions
