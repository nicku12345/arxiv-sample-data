We consider interlacing properties satisfied by the zeros of Jacobi polynomials in quasi-orthogonal sequences characterised by \alpha>-1, -2<\beta<-1. We give necessary and sufficient conditions under which a conjecture by Askey, that the zeros of Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)} and P_{n}^{(\alpha,\beta+2)} are interlacing, holds when the parameters \alpha and \beta are in the range \alpha>-1 and -2<\beta<-1. We prove that the zeros of P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)} and P_{n+1}^{(\alpha,\beta)} do not interlace for any n\in\mathbb{N}, n\geq2 and any fixed \alpha, \beta with \alpha>-1, -2<\beta<-1. The interlacing of zeros of P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)} and P_m^{(\alpha,\beta+t)} for m,n\in\mathbb{N} is discussed for \alpha and \beta in this range, t\geq 1, and new upper and lower bounds are derived for the zero of P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)} that is less than -1.
