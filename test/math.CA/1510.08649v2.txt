We study the boundedness problem for maximal operators \mathcal{M} associated to averages along families of hypersurfaces S of finite type in \mathbb{R}^n. In this paper, we prove that if S is a finite type hypersurface which is of finite type k at x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n, then the associated maximal operator is bounded on L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) for p>k. We shall also consider a variable coefficient version of maximal theorem and we obtain the same L^p- boundedness result for p>k.   We also discuss the consequence of this result. In particular, we verify a conjecture by E. M. Stein and its generalization by A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer on the connection between the decay rate of the Fourier transform of the surface measure on S and the L^p- boundedness of the associated maximal operator \mathcal{M}.
