In this paper, we introduce a Kantorovich type generalization of Jakimovski-Leviatan operators constructed by A. Jakimovski and D. Leviatan (1969) and the theorems on convergence and the degrree of convergence are established. Furthermore, we study the convergence of these operators in a weighted space of functions on a positive semi-axis.
