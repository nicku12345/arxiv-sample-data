The Ermakov-Pinney Equation, \ddot{x}+\omega^2 x=\frac{h^2}{x^3}, has a varied provenance which we briefly delineate. We introduce time-dependent functions in place of the \omega^2 and h^2. The former has no effect upon the algebra of the Lie point symmetries of the equation. The latter destroys the sl(2,\Re) symmetry and a single symmetry persists only when there is a specific relationship between the two time-dependent functions introduced. We calculate the form of the corresponding autonomous equation for these cases.
