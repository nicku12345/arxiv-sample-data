We study the action of hypergeometric shift operators on the Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric functions associated with the BC_n type root system and some negative multiplicities. Those hypergeometric functions are connected to the \chi-spherical functions on Hermitian symmetric spaces U/K where \chi is a nontrivial character of K. We apply shift operators to the hypergeometric functions to move negative multiplicities to positive ones. This allows us to use many well-known results of the hypergeometric functions associated with positive multiplicities. In particular, we use this technique to achieve exponential estimates for the \chi-spherical functions. The motive comes from the Paley-Wiener type theorem on line bundles over Hermitian symmetric spaces.
