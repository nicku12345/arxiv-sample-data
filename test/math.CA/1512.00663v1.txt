In this paper, we established the boundedness of m-linear Marcinkiewicz integral on Campanato type spaces. We showed that if the m-linear Marcinkiewicz integral is finite for one point, then it is finite almost everywhere. Moreover, the following norm inequality holds, \|\mu(\vec{f})\|_{\mathcal{E}^{\alpha,p}} \leq C\prod_{j=1}^m\|f_j\|_{\mathcal{E}^{\alpha_j,p_j}}, where \mathcal{E}^{\alpha,p} is the classical Campanato spaces.
