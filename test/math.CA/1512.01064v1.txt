We analyse a family of mutually orthogonal polynomials on the unit ball with respect to an inner product which involves the outward normal derivatives on the sphere. Using their representation in terms of spherical harmonics, algebraic and analytic properties will be deduced. First, we deduce explicit connection formulas relating classical multivariate ball polynomials and our family of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. Then explicit representations for the norms and the kernels will be obtained. Finally, the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding Christoffel functions is studied.
