We present dimension-free reverse H\"older inequalities for strong A^*_p weights, 1\le p < \infty. We also provide a proof for the full range of local integrability of A_1^* weights. The common ingredient is a multidimensional version of Riesz's "rising sun" lemma. Our results are valid for any nonnegative Radon measure with no atoms. For p=\infty, we also provide a reverse H\"older inequality for certain product measures. As a corollary we derive mixed A_p^*-A_\infty^* weighted estimates.
