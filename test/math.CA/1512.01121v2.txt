Identities involving finite sums of products of hypergeometric functions and their duals have been studied since 1930s. Recently Beukers and Jouhet have used an algebraic approach to derive a very general family of duality relations. In this paper we provide an alternative way of obtaining such results. Our method is very simple and it is based on the non-local derangement identity.
