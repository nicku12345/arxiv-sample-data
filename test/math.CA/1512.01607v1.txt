Let X_1 and X_2 be metric spaces equipped with doubling measures and let L_1 and L_2 be nonnegative self-adjoint second-order operators acting on L^2(X_1) and L^2(X_2) respectively. We study multivariable spectral multipliers F(L_1, L_2) acting on the Cartesian product of X_1 and X_2. Under the assumptions of the finite propagation speed property and Plancherel or Stein--Tomas restriction type estimates on the operators L_1 and~L_2, we show that if a function~F satisfies a Marcinkiewicz-type differential condition then the spectral multiplier operator F(L_1, L_2) is bounded from appropriate Hardy spaces to Lebesgue spaces on the product space X_1\times X_2. We apply our results to the analysis of second-order elliptic operators in the product setting, specifically Riesz-transform-like operators and double Bochner--Riesz means.
