The paper develops applications of symmetric orbit functions, known from irreducible representations of simple Lie groups, in numerical analysis. It is shown that these functions have remarkable properties which yield to cubature formulas, approximating a weighted integral of any function by a weighted finite sum of function values, in connection with any simple Lie group. The cubature formulas are specialized for simple Lie groups of rank two. An optimal approximation of any function by multivariate polynomials arising from symmetric orbit functions is discussed.
