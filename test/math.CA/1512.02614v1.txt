In this paper, we first give two uniform asymptotic approximations of the eigenfunctions of the weighted finite Fourier transform operator, defined by {\displaystyle \mathcal F_c^{(\alpha)} f(x)=\int_{-1}^1 e^{icxy} f(y)\,(1-y^2)^{\alpha}\, dy,\,} where  c >0, \alpha > -1 are two fixed real numbers. The first uniform approximation is given in terms of a Bessel function, whereas the second one is given in terms of a normalized Jacobi polynomial. These eigenfunctions are called generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions (GPSWFs). By using the uniform asymptotic approximations of the GPSWFs, we prove the super-exponential decay rate of the eigenvalues of the operator \mathcal F_c^{(\alpha)} in the case where 0<\alpha < 3/2. Finally, by computing the trace and an estimate of the norm of the operator {\displaystyle \mathcal Q_c^{\alpha}=\frac{c}{2\pi} \mathcal F_c^{{\alpha}^*} \mathcal F_c^{\alpha},} we give a lower and an upper bound for the counting number of the eigenvalues of Q_c^{\alpha}, when c>>1.
