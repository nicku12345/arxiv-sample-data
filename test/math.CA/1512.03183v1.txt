For functions f(x_{1},x_{2})=f_{0}\big(\max\{|x_{1}|,|x_{2}|\}\big) from L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2}), sufficient and necessary conditions for the belonging of their Fourier transform \widehat{f} to L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2}) as well as of a function t\cdot \sup\limits_{y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}\geq t^{2}}\big|\widehat{f}(y_{1},y_{2})\big| to L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{1}_{+}). As for the positivity of \widehat{f} on \mathbb{R}^{2}, it is completely reduced to the same question on \mathbb{R}^{1} for a function f_{1}(x)=|x|f_{0}\big(|x|\big)+\int\limits_{|x|}^{\infty}f_{0}(t)dt.
