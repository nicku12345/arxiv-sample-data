We use the polynomial partitioning method of Guth to prove weighted Fourier restriction estimates in \Bbb R^3 with exponents p that range between 3 and 3.25, depending on the weight. As a corollary to our main theorem, we obtain new (non-weighted) local and global restriction estimates for compact C^\infty surfaces S \subset \Bbb R^3 with strictly positive second fundamental form. For example, we establish the global restriction estimate \| Ef \|_{L^p(\Bbb R^3)} \leq C \, \| f \|_{L^q(S)} in the full conjectured range of exponents for p > 3.25 (up to the sharp line), and the global restriction estimate \| Ef \|_{L^p(\Omega)} \leq C \, \| f \|_{L^2(S)} for p>3 and certain sets \Omega \subset \Bbb R^3 of infinite Lebesgue measure. As a corollary to our main theorem, we also obtain new results on the decay of spherical means of Fourier transforms of positive compactly supported measures on \Bbb R^3 with finite \alpha-dimensional energies.
