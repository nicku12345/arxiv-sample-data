In this paper, we consider a new class of convex functions which is called h_{\varphi}-preinvex functions. We prove several Hermite--Hadamard type inequalities for differentiable h_\varphi-preinvex functions via Fractional Integrals. Some special cases are also discussed. Our results extend and improve the corresponding ones in the literature.
