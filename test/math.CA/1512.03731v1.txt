In the present paper we propose a Kantorovich variant of (p,q)-analogue of Szasz-Mirakjan operators. We establish the moments of the operators with the help of a recurrence relation that we have derived and then prove the basic convergence theorem. Next, the local approximation as well as weighted approximation properties of these new operators in terms of modulus of continuity are studied.
