We introduce multilinear analogues of dyadic paraproduct operators and Haar Multipliers, and study boundedness properties of these operators and their commutators. We also characterize dyadic BMO functions via the boundedness of certain paraproducts and also via the boundedness of the commutators of multilinear Haar Multipliers and paraproduct operators.
