By the method of weight coefficients, techniques of real analysis and Hermite-Hadamard's inequality, a half-discrete Hardy-Hilbert-type inequality related to the kernel of the hyperbolic cosecant function with the best possible constant factor expressed in terms of the extended Riemann-zeta function is proved. The more accurate equivalent forms, the operator expressions with the norm, the reverses and some particular cases are also considered.
