A classical theorem of Ingham extended Parseval's formula of the trigonometrical system to arbitrary families of exponentials satisfying a uniform gap condition. Later his result was extended to several dimensions, but the optimal integration domains have only been determined in very few cases. The purpose of this paper is to determine the optimal connected integration domains for all regular two-dimensional lattices.
