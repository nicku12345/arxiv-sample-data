A new Hilbert-type integral inequality in the whole plane with the non-homogeneous kernel and parameters is given. The constant factor related to the hypergeometric function and the beta function is proved to be the best possible. As applications, equivalent forms, the reverses, some particular examples, two kinds of Hardy-type inequalities, and operator expressions are considered.
