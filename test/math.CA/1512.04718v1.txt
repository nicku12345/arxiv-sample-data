Using methods of weight functions, techniques of real analysis as well as the Hermite-Hadamard inequality, a half-discrete Hardy-Hilbert-type inequality with multi-parameters and a best possible constant factor related to the Hurwitz zeta function and the Riemann zeta function is obtained. Equivalent forms, normed operator expressions, their reverses and some particular cases are also considered.
