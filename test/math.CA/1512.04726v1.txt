We prove that a typical compact set does not contain any similar copy of a given pattern. We also prove that a typical compact set of [0,1]^{d} (d\geq 2) intersects any (d-1)-dimensional plane in at most d points. We study the "hitting probabilities" of compact sets in the sense of Baire category. In the end we study the arithmetic properties of typical compact sets in [0,1] and the "hitting probabilities" of continuous functions.
