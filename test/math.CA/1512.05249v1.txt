This article considers Whittaker's function W_{\kappa ,\mu } where \kappa is real and \mu is real or purely imaginary. Then \varphi (x)=x^{-\mu -1/2}W_{\kappa ,\mu }(x) arises as the scattering function of a continuous time linear system with state space L^2(1/2, \infty ) and input and output spaces {\bf C}. The Hankel operator \Gamma_\varphi on L^2(0, \infty ) is expressed as a matrix with respect to the Laguerre basis and gives the Hankel matrix of moments of a Jacobi weight w. The operation of translating \varphi is equivalent to multiplying w by an exponential factor to give w_\varepsilon. The determinant of the Hankel matrix of moments of w_\varepsilon satisfies the \sigma form of Painlev\'e's transcendental differential equation PV. It is shown that \Gamma_\varphi gives rise to the Whittaker kernel from random matrix theory, as studied by Borodin and Olshanski (Comm. Math. Phys. 211 (2000), 335--358).\par
