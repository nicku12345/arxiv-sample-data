A thorough analysis of values of the function m\mapsto\mbox{sn}(K(m)u\mid m) for complex parameter m and u\in (0,1) is given. First, it is proved that the absolute value of this function never exceeds 1 if m does not belong to the region in \mathbb{C} determined by inequalities |z-1|<1 and |z|>1. The global maximum of the function under investigation is shown to be always located in this region. More precisely, it is proved that, if u\leq1/2, then the global maxim is located at m=1 with the value equal to 1. While if u>1/2, then the global maximum is located in the interval (1,2) and its value exceeds 1. In addition, more subtle extremal properties are studied numerically. Finally, applications in a Laplace-type integral and spectral analysis of some complex Jacobi matrices are presented.
