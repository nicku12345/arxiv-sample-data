The aim of this paper is to characterize in broad classes of means the so-called Hardy means, i.e., those means M\colon\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb{R}_+^n\to\mathbb{R}_+ that satisfy the inequality    \sum_{n=1}^\infty M(x_1,\dots,x_n) \le C\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n  for all positive sequences (x_n) with some finite positive constant C. One of the main results offers a characterization of Hardy means in the class of symmetric, increasing, Jensen concave and repetition invariant means and also a formula for the best constant C satisfying the above inequality.
