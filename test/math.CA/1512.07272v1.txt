In this paper we investigate continuity properties of functions f:\mathbb{R}_+\to\mathbb{R}_+ that satisfy the (p,q)-Jensen convexity inequality  f\big(H_p(x,y)\big)\leq H_q(f(x),f(y)) \qquad(x,y>0),  where H_p stands for the pth power (or H\"older) mean. One of the main results shows that there exist discontinuous multiplicative functions that are (p,p)-Jensen convex for all positive rational number p. A counterpart of this result states that if f is (p,p)-Jensen convex for all p\in P\subseteq\mathbb{R}_+, where P is a set of positive Lebesgue measure, then f must be continuous.
