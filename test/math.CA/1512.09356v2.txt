We show that the bilinear Hilbert transform H_{\Gamma} along curves \Gamma=(t,-\gamma(t)) with \gamma\in\mathcal{N}\mathcal{F}^{C} is bounded from L^{p}(\mathbb{R})\times L^{q}(\mathbb{R})\,\rightarrow\,L^{r}(\mathbb{R}) where p,\,q,\,r are H\"older indices, i.e. \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{r}, with 1<p<\infty, 1<q\leq\infty and 1\leq r<\infty. Here \mathcal{N}\mathcal{F}^{C} stands for a wide class of smooth "non-flat" curves near zero and infinity whose precise definition is given in Section 2. This continues author's earlier work on this topic, extending the boundedness range of H_{\Gamma} to any triple of indices (\frac{1}{p},\,\frac{1}{q},\,\frac{1}{r'}) within the Banach triangle. Our result is optimal up to end-points.
