The purpose of this article is to give a Chlodowsky type generalization of Szasz operators defined by means of the Sheffer type polynomials. We obtain convergence properties of our operators with the help of Korovkin's theorem and the order of convergence by using a classical approach, the second order modulus of continuity and Peetre's K-functional. Moreover, we study the convergence of these operators in a weighted space of functions on a positive semi-axis and estimate the approximation by using a new type of weighted modulus of continuity introduced by Gadjiev and Aral in [12]. An algorithm is also given to plot graphical examples, and we have shown the convergence of these operators towards the function and these examples can be take as a comparison between the new operators with the previous one too. Finally, some numerical examples are also given.
