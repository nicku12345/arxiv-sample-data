Let A_\infty ^+ denote the class of one-sided Muckenhoupt weights, namely all the weights w for which \mathsf M^+:L^p(w)\to L^{p,\infty}(w) for some p>1, where \mathsf M^+ is the forward Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. We show that w\in A_\infty ^+ if and only if there exist numerical constants \gamma\in(0,1) and c>0 such that  w(\{x \in \mathbb{R} : \, \mathsf M ^+\mathbf 1_E (x)>\gamma\})\leq c w(E)  for all measurable sets E\subset \mathbb R. Furthermore, letting  \mathsf C_w ^+(\alpha):= \sup_{0<w(E)<+\infty} \frac{1}{w(E)} w(\{x\in\mathbb R:\,\mathsf M^+\mathbf 1_E (x)>\alpha\})  we show that for all w\in A_\infty ^+ we have the asymptotic estimate \mathsf C_w ^+ (\alpha)-1\lesssim (1-\alpha)^\frac{1}{c[w]_{A_\infty ^+}} for \alpha sufficiently close to 1 and c>0 a numerical constant, and that this estimate is best possible. We also show that the reverse H\"older inequality for one-sided Muckenhoupt weights, previously proved by Mart\'in-Reyes and de la Torre, is sharp, thus providing a quantitative equivalent definition of A_\infty ^+. Our methods also allow us to show that a weight w\in A_\infty ^+ satisfies w\in A_p ^+ for all p>e^{c[w]_{A_\infty ^+}}.
