Let T_{\vec{b}} and T_{\Pi b} be the commutators in the j-th entry and iterated commutators of the multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators, respectively. It was well-known that T_{\vec{b}} and T_{\Pi b} were not of weak type (1,1) and (H^1, L^1), but they did satisfy certain endpoint L\log L type estimates. In this paper, our aim is to give more natural sharp endpoint results. We show that T_{\vec{b}} and T_{\Pi b} are bounded from product Hardy space H^1\times\cdot\cdot\cdot\times H^1 to weak L^{\frac{1}{m},\infty} space, whenever the kernel satisfies a class of Dini type condition. This was done by using a key lemma given by M. Christ, a very complex decomposition of the integrand domains and splitting and estimating the commutators very carefully into several terms and cases.
