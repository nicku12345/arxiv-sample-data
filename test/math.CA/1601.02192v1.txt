In this paper, we present series representations of the remainders in the expansions for 2/(e^t+1), \mbox{sech} t and \coth t.   For example, we prove that for t > 0 and N\in\mathbb{N}:=\{1, 2, \ldots\}, \[\mbox{sech}\, t=\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\frac{E_{2j}}{(2j)!}t^{2j}+R_N(t) \] with \[ R_N(t)=\frac{(-1)^{N}2t^{2N}}{\pi^{2N-1}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{(k+\frac{1}{2})^{2N-1}\Big(t^2+\pi^2(k+\frac{1}{2})^2\Big)}, \] and \[\mbox{sech}\, t=\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\frac{E_{2j}}{(2j)!}t^{2j}+\Theta(t, N)\frac{E_{2N}}{(2N)!}t^{2N} \] with a suitable 0 < \Theta(t, N) < 1. Here E_n are the Euler numbers. By using the obtained results, we deduce some inequalities and completely monotonic functions associated with the ratio of gamma functions. Furthermore, we give a (presumably new) quadratic recurrence relation for the Bernoulli numbers.
