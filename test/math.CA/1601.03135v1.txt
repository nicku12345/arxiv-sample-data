It is shown that if \gamma is a path of finite p variation (1\leq p< 2) in a euclidean vector space and f,g,h are Lipschitz functions on the trace of \gamma then s\mapsto F(s)=\int_\gamma f^sg dh defines an entire holomorphic function provided the convex hull of the image of f does not contain zero. If in addition |\log z|\leq \log 2 on the convex hull of the image of f then for any s\in \mathbf{C}, F(s) can be computed from the nonnegative integer values \{F(k)\}_{k\in \mathbf{N}}. If in addition to these hypotheses each of f,g,h is a polynomial, then the values F(k) are computable directly from the signature of \gamma thus all values of F(s) are computable from the signature. As a special case the winding number of a closed path \gamma around an affine submanifold of codimension two is computed from finitely many terms of the signature provided certain estimates are satisfied.
