Let G_n be the Barnes multiple Gamma function of order n and the function f_n(z) be defined as \begin{align*} f_n(z)=\dfrac{\log G_n(z+1)}{z^n\Log z},\quad z\in \mathbb{C}\setminus (-\infty,0]. \end{align*} In this work, a conjecture to find the Stieltjes representation is proposed such that f_n(z) is a Pick function. The conjecture is established for the particular case n=3 by examining the properties of f_3(z).
