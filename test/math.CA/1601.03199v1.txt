Tur\'an type inequalities for modified Bessel functions of the first kind are used to deduce some sharp lower and upper bounds for the asymptotic order parameter of the stochastic Kuramoto model. Moreover, approximation from the Lagrange inversion theorem and a rational approximation are given for the asymptotic order parameter.
