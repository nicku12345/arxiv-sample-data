We provide an alternative and self contained proof of the main result of Bennett, Carbery, Tao regarding the multilinear restriction estimate. The approach is inspired by the recent result of Guth about the Kakeya version of multilinear restriction estimate. At lower levels of multilinearity we provide a refined estimate in the context of small support for one of the terms involved.
