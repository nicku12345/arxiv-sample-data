We add to the literature the following observation. If \mu is a singular measure on \mathbb{R}^n which assigns measure zero to every porous set and f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R} is a Lipschitz function which is non-differentiable \mu-a.e. then for every C^1 function g:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R} it holds \mu\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n: f(x)=g(x)\}=0. In other words the Lusin type approximation property of Lipschitz functions with C^1 functions does not hold with respect to a general Radon measure.
