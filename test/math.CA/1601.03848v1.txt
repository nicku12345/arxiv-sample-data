This paper is a continuation of earlier work by the first author who determined the John--Nirenberg constant of {\rm BMO}^p\big((0,1)\big) for the range 1\le p\le 2. Here, we compute that constant for p>2. As before, the main results rely on Bellman functions for the L^p norms of logarithms of A_\infty weights, but for p>2 these functions turn out to have a significantly more complicated structure than for 1\le p\le 2.
