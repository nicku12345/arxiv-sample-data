We investigate and derive second solutions to linear homogeneous second-order difference equations using a variety of methods, in each case going beyond the purely formal solution and giving explicit expressions for the second solution. We present a new implementation of d'Alembert's reduction of order method, applying it to linear second-order recursion equations. Further, we introduce an iterative method to obtain a general solution, giving two linearly independent polynomial solutions to the recurrence relation. In the case of a particular confluent hypergeometric function for which the standard second solution is not independent of the first, i.e. the solutions are degenerate, we use the corresponding differential equation and apply the extended Cauchy-integral method to find a polynomial second solution for the difference equation. We show that the standard d'Alembert method also generates this polynomial solution.
