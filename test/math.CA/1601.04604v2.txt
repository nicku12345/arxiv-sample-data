We study the subspaces of L_p(\mathbb{R}^d) that consist of functions whose Fourier transforms vanish on a smooth surface of codimension 1. We show that a subspace defined in such a manner coincides with the whole L_p space for p > \frac{2d}{d+1}. We also prove density of smooth functions in such spaces when p < \frac{2d}{d+1} for specific cases of surfaces and give an equivalent definition in terms of differential operators.
