In the present study, we have given a corrigendum to our paper on the approximation properties of bivariate (p, q)-Bernstein operators. Recently, we \cite{kar} have defined the bivariate (p, q)-Bernstein operators. Later, we have aware of Acar et. al \cite{acar} already have given some moments. In this case, we have revised \cite[Lemma 2.3]{kar}.
