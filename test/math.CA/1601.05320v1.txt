In this paper, we consider a discontinuous Dirac operator depending polynomially on the spectral parameter and a finite number of transmission conditions. We get some properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Then, we investigate some uniqueness theorems by using Weyl function and some spectral data.
