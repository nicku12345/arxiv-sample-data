We introduce a class \Lambda_{s} of functions with complicated local structure. Any function from the class belongs to one of three specifically defined types f^s _k, f_+, and f^{-1} _+ or is a specifically defined composition of two or three functions of these types. Differential, integral, fractal and other properties of such functions are investigated. In particular, all functions f from \Lambda_{s} such that f(x)\ne x, f(x)\ne -\frac{s-1}{s+1}-x and f(x)\ne 1-x are nonmonotonic and nowhere differentiable. The Hausdorff--Besicovitch dimension of a plot of each f \in \Lambda_s is equal to 1, and the Lebesgue integral of f is equal to \frac 1 2. The proof of these statements for the compositions and the corresponding proofs for f^s _k, f_+, and f^{-1} _+ are similar.
