Alternating current (AC) electrical drive control without mechanical sensors is an active research topic. This paper studies the observability of both induction machine and synchronous machine sensorless drives. Observer-based sensorless techniques are known for their deteriorated performance in some operating conditions. An observability analysis of the machines helps understanding (and improving) the observer's behavior in the aforementioned conditions.
