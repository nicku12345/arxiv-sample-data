Chromatic derivatives and series expansions of bandlimited functions have recently been introduced in signal processing and they have been shown to be useful in practical applications. We extend the notion of chromatic derivative using varying weights. When the kernel function of the integral operator is positive, this extension ensures chromatic expansions around every points. Besides old examples, the modified method is demonstrated via some new ones as Walsh-Fourier transform, and Poisson-wavelet transform. Moreover the chromatic expansion of a function in some L^p-space is investigated.
