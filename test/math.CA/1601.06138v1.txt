We examine the energy function with respect to the zeros of exceptional Hermite polynomials. The localization of the eigenvalues of the Hessian is given in the general case. In some special arrangements we have a more precise result on the behavior of the energy function. Finally we investigate the energy function with respect to the regular zeros of the exceptional Hermite polynomials.
