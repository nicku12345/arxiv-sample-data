Let G be a connected, simply connected, compact semisimple Lie group of dimension n. It has been shown by Clerc \cite{Clerc1974} that, for any f\in L^1(G), the Bochner-Riesz mean S_R^\delta(f) converges almost everywhere to f, provided \delta>(n-1)/2. In this paper, we show that, at the critical index \delta=(n-1)/2, there exists an f\in L^1(G) such that \limsup_{R\rightarrow\infty} \big|S_{R}^{(n-1)/2}(f)(x)\big|=\infty, \ \text{a.e.}\ x\in G. This is an analogue of a well-known result of Kolmogorov \cite{Kolmogoroff1923} for Fourier series on the circle, and a result of Stein \cite{Stein1961} for Bochner-Riesz means on the tori \mathbb T^{n}, n\geq 2. We also study localization properties of the Bochner-Riesz mean S_{R}^{(n-1)/2}(f) for f\in L^1(G).
