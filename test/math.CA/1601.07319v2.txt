Let E \subset \mathbb{C} be a Borel set such that 0<\mathcal{H}^1(E)<\infty. David and L\'eger proved that the Cauchy kernel 1/z (and even its coordinate parts \textrm{Re}\, z/|z|^2 and \textrm{Im}\, z/|z|^2, z\in \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}) has the following property (*): the L^2(\mathcal{H}^1\lfloor E)-boundedness of the corresponding singular integral operator implies the rectifiability of E. Recently Chousionis, Mateu, Prat and Tolsa extended this result to any kernel of the form (\textrm{Re}\, z)^{2n-1}/|z|^{2n}, n\in \mathbb{N}. In this paper, we prove that the property (*) is valid for operators associated to the much wider class of kernels (\textrm{Re}\, z)^{2N-1}/|z|^{2N}+t\cdot(\textrm{Re}\, z)^{2n-1}/|z|^{2n}, where n,N are positive integer numbers such that N\ge n, and t\in \mathbb{R}\setminus (t_1,t_2) with t_1,t_2 depending only on n and N.
