In this paper we prove several weighted estimates for bilinear fractional integral operators and their commutators with BMO functions. We also prove maximal function control theorem for these operators, that is, we prove the weighted L^p norm is bounded by the weighted L^p norm of a natural maximal operator when the weight belongs to A_\infty. As a corollary we are able to obtain new weighted estimates for the bilinear maximal function associated to the bilinear Hilbert transform.
