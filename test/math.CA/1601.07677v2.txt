We study L^p\to L^r estimates for restricted averaging operators related to algebraic varieties V of d-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields \mathbb F_q with q elements. We observe properties of both the Fourier restriction operator and the averaging operator over V\subset \mathbb F_q^d. As a consequence, we obtain optimal results on the restricted averaging problems for spheres and paraboloids in dimensions d\ge2, and cones in odd dimensions d\ge 3. In addition, when the variety V is a cone lying in an even dimensional vector space over \mathbb F_q and -1 is a square number in \mathbb F_q, we also obtain sharp estimates except for two endpoints.
