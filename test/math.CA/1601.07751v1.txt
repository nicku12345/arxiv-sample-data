We consider the generalised Mathieu series \[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^\gamma}{(n^\lambda+a^\lambda)^\mu}\qquad (\mu>0)\] when the parameters \lambda (>0) and \gamma are even integers for large complex a in the sector |\arg\,a|<\pi/\lambda. The asymptotics in this case consist of a {\it finite} algebraic expansion together with an infinite sequence of increasingly subdominant exponentially small expansions. When \mu is also a positive integer it is possible to give closed-form evaluations of this series. Numerical results are given to illustrate the accuracy of the expansion obtained.
