In this contribution, we study the orthogonality conditions satisfied by Al-Salam-Carlitz polynomials U^{(a)}_n(x;q) when the parameters a and q are not necessarily real nor `classical', i.e., the linear functional \bf u with respect to such polynomial sequence is quasi-definite and not positive definite. We establish orthogonality on a simple contour in the complex plane which depends on the parameters. In all cases we show that the orthogonality conditions characterize the Al-Salam-Carlitz polynomials U_n^{(a)}(x;q) of degree n up to a constant factor. We also obtain a generalization of the unique generating function for these polynomials.
