We discuss and compare upper and lower bounds obtained by two different methods for the positive zero of the ultraspherical polynomial C_{n}^{(\lambda)} that is greater than 1 when -3/2 < \lambda < -1/2. Our first approach uses mixed three term recurrence relations and interlacing of zeros while the second approach uses a method going back to Euler and Rayleigh and already applied to Bessel functions and Laguerre and q-Laguerre polynomials. We use the bounds obtained by the second method to simplify the proof of the interlacing of the zeros of (1-x^2)C_{n}^{(\lambda)} and C_{n+1}^{(\lambda)}, for -3/2 < \lambda < \infty.
