We examine the exponentially improved asymptotic expansion of the Lerch zeta function L(\lambda,a,s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \exp (2\pi ni\lambda)/(n+a)^s for large complex values of a, with \lambda and s regarded as parameters. It is shown that an infinite number of subdominant exponential terms switch on across the Stokes lines \arg\,a=\pm\pi/2. In addition, it is found that the transition across the upper and lower imaginary a-axes is associated, in general, with unequal scales. Numerical calculations are presented to confirm the theoretical predictions.
