We state and prove a number of unilateral and bilateral q-series identities and explore some of their consequences. Those include certain generalizations of the q-binomial sum which also generalize the q-Airy function introduced by Ramanujan, as well as certain identities with an interesting variable-parameter symmetry based on limiting cases of Heine's transformation of basic hypergeomteric functions.
