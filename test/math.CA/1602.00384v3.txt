In a nutshell, we intend to extend Schoenberg's classical theorem connecting conditionally positive semidefinite functions F\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{C}, n \in \mathbb{N}, and their positive semidefinite exponentials \exp(tF), t > 0, to the case of matrix-valued functions F \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{C}^{m \times m}, m \in \mathbb{N}. Moreover, we study the closely associated property that \exp(t F(- i \nabla)), t>0, is positivity preserving and its failure to extend directly in the matrix-valued context.
