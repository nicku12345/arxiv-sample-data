Chen and Cheung [C.-P. Chen, W.-S. Cheung, Sharpness of Wilker and Huygens type inequalities, J. Inequal. Appl. 2012 (2012) 72, \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1029-242X-2012-72}] established sharp Wilker and Huygens-type inequalities. These authors also proposed three conjectures on Wilker and Huygens-type inequalities. In this paper, we consider these conjectures. We also present sharp Wilker and Huygens-type inequalities.
