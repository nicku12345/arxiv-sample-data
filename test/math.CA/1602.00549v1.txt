Let \Omega be homogeneous of degree zero, have mean value zero and integrable on the unit sphere, and \mathcal{M}_{\Omega} be the higher-dimensional Marcinkiewicz integral associated with \Omega. In this paper, the authors proved that if \Omega\in L^q(S^{n-1}) for some q\in (1,\,\infty], then for p\in (q',\,\infty) and w\in A_{p}(\mathbb{R}^n), the bound of \mathcal{M}_{\Omega} on L^p(\mathbb{R}^n,\,w) is less than C[w]_{A_{p/q'}}^{2\max\{1,\,\frac{1}{p-q'}\}}.
