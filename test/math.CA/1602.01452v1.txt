In this work, we give the general solution sequential linear conformable fractional differential equations in the case of constant coefficients for {\alpha}(\in)(0,1]. In homogeneous case, we use a fractional exponential function which generalizes the corresponding ordinary function. In non-homogeneous case, we present to fractional the method of variation of parameters for a particular solution of sequential linear conformable fractional differential equations.
