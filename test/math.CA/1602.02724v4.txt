We introduce the notion of "hypergeometric" polynomials with respect to Newtonian bases. These polynomials are eigenfunctions (L P_n(x) = \lambda_n P_n(x)) of some abstract operator L which is 2-diagonal in the Newtonian basis \varphi_n(x): L \varphi_n(x) = \lambda_n \varphi_n(x) + \tau_n(x) \varphi_{n-1}(x) with some coefficients \lambda_n, \tau_n. We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the polynomials P_n(x) to be orthogonal. For the special cases where the sets \lambda_n correspond to the classical grids, we find the complete solution to these conditions and observe that it leads to the most general Askey-Wilson polynomials and their special and degenerate classes.
