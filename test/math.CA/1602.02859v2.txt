In this paper, the index groups for which the weighted Young's inequalities hold in both continuous case and discrete case are characterized. As applications, the index groups for the product inequalities on modulation spaces are characterized, we also obtain the weakest conditions for the boundedness of bilinear Fourier multipliers on modulation spaces in some sense. For the fractional integral operator, the sharp conditions for the boundedness of power weighted Lp-Lq estimates in both continuous case and discrete case are obtained. By a quite different approach from others, our theorems optimize some previous results which are committed to finding sharp conditions for some classical convolution inequalities.
