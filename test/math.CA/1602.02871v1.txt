In this paper, some properties on weighted modulation and Wiener amalgam spaces are characterized by the corresponding properties on weighted Lebesgue spaces. As applications, sharp conditions for product inequalities, convolution inequalities and embedding on weighted modulation and Wiener amalgam spaces are obtained. These applications improve and extend many known results.
