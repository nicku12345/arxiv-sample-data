These are the class notes of lectures given by Ralph Henstock at the New University of Ulster in 1970-71. The notes deal with the Riemann-complete integral (also known as the generalized Riemann integral, the gauge integral, and the Henstock-Kurzweil integral). They also introduce Henstock's abstract theory of integration.
