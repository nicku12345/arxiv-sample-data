We prove that for \nu>n-1 all zeros of the nth derivative of Bessel function of the first kind J_{\nu} are real and simple. Moreover, we show that the positive zeros of the nth and (n+1)th derivative of Bessel function of the first kind J_{\nu} are interlacing when \nu\geq n, and n is a natural number or zero. Our methods include the Weierstrassian representation of the nth derivative, properties of the Laguerre-P\'olya class of entire functions, and the Laguerre inequalities. Some similar results for the zeros of the first and second derivative of the Struve function of the first kind \mathbf{H}_{\nu} are also proved. The main results obtained in this paper generalize and complement some classical results on the zeros of Bessel functions of the first kind. Some open problems related to Hurwitz theorem on the zeros of Bessel functions are also proposed, which may be of interest for further research.
