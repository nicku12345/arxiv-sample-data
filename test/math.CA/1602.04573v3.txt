In this article we propose an extension of Appell hypergeometric function F_2 (or equivalently F_3). It is derived from a particular solution of a higher order Painlev\'e system in two variables. On the other hand, an extension of Appell's F_1 was introduced by Tsuda. We also show that those two extensions are equivalent at the level of systems of linear partial differential equations.
