In this paper, certain mixed special polynomial families associated with Appell sequences are introduced and their properties are established. Further, operational rules providing connections between these families and the known special polynomials are established, which are used to derive the identities and results for the members of these new families. Determinantal definitions of the polynomials associated with Appell family is also derived. The approach presented is general.
