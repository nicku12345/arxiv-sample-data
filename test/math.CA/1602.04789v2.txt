This note establishes the full range of L^p--L^q Fourier extension estimates for the model n-dimensional quadratic submanifold in {\mathbb R}^{n(n+3)/2} parametrized by \gamma(x_1,\ldots,x_n) := (x_1,\ldots,x_n, (x_i x_j)_{1 \leq i \leq j \leq n}). This class of submanifolds is extremal in the sense that an n-dimensional quadratic submanifold of {\mathbb R}^d can only satisfy nontrivial Fourier extension inequalities when d \leq \frac{n(n+3)}{2}. The proof is via an inflation-type argument, with the unexpected twist that a significant amount of "overinflation" is necessary but in no way limits the sharpness of the argument.
