In \cite{II}, authors introduced the concept of harmonically (s,m)-convex functions in second sense which unifies different type of convexities and is more general notion of Harmonic convexity. In this paper, authors obtain new estimates on generalization of Hermite-Hadamard and Simpson type inequalities for this larger class of functions.
