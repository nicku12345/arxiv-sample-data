In this paper we compute the leading terms in the sum of the k^{th} power of the roots of L_{p}^{(\alpha)}, the Laguerre-polynomial of degree p with parameter \alpha. The connection between the Laguerre-polynomials and the Marchenko-Pastur distribution is expressed by the fact, among others, that the limiting distribution of the empirical distribution of the normalized roots of the Laguerre-polynomials is given by the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We give a direct proof of this statement based on the recursion satisfied by the Laguerre-polynomials. At the same time, our main result gives that the leading term in p and (\alpha+p) of the sum of the k^{th} power of the roots of L_{p}^{(\alpha)} coincides with the k^{th} moment of the Marchenko-Pastur law. We also mention the fact that the expectation of the characteristic polynomial of a XX^T type random covariance matrix, where X is a p\times n random matrix with iid elements, is \ell^{(n-p)}_p, i.e. the monic version of the p^{th} Laguerre polynomial with parameter n-p.
