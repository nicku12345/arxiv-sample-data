We study approximation of functions by algebraic polynomials in the H\"older spaces corresponding to the generalized Jacobi translation and the Ditzian-Totik moduli of smoothness. By using modifications of the classical moduli of smoothness, we give improvements of the direct and inverse theorems of approximation and prove the criteria of the precise order of decrease of the best approximation in these spaces. Moreover, we obtain strong converse inequalities for some methods of approximation of functions. As an example, we consider approximation by the Durrmeyer-Bernstein polynomial operators.
