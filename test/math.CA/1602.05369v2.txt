We study several fundamental harmonic analysis operators in the multi-dimensional context of the Dunkl harmonic oscillator and the underlying group of reflections isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}_2^d. Noteworthy, we admit negative values of the multiplicity functions. Our investigations include maximal operators, g-functions, Lusin area integrals, Riesz transforms and multipliers of Laplace and Laplace-Stieltjes type. By means of the general Calder\'on-Zygmund theory we prove that these operators are bounded on weighted L^p spaces, 1 < p < \infty, and from weighted L^1 to weighted weak L^1. We also obtain similar results for analogous set of operators in the closely related multi-dimensional Laguerre-symmetrized framework. The latter emerges from a symmetrization procedure proposed recently by the first two authors. As a by-product of the main developments we get some new results in the multi-dimensional Laguerre function setting of convolution type.
