The one-dimensional oscillatory integral operator associated to a real analytic phase S is given by  T_\lambda f(x) =\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{i\lambda S(x,y)} \chi(x,y) f(y) dy.  In this paper, we obtain a complete characterization for the mapping properties of T_\lambda  on L^p(\mathbb R) spaces, namely we prove that \|T_\lambda\|_p \lesssim |\lambda|^{-\alpha}\|f\|_p for some \alpha>0 if and only if the point (\frac 1 {\alpha p} , \frac 1 {\alpha p'}) lies in the reduced Newton polygon of S, and this estimate is sharp if and only if it lies on the reduced Newton diagram.
