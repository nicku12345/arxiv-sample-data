In this paper, we study a class of multilinear fractional integral operators which have correlation kernels \prod_{1\leq i<j \leq k}|x_i-x_j|^{-\alpha_{ij}}. The necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained under which these oprators are bounded from L^{p_1}\times \cdots \times L^{p_k} into L^q. As a consequence, we also get the endpoint estimates from L^{p_1}\times \cdots \times L^{p_k} to BMO of these operators.
