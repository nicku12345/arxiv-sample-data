In this paper, we have given a corrigendum to our paper "Some Approximation Results by (p,q)-analogue of Bernstein-Stancu Operators" published in Applied Mathematics and Computation 264 (2015) 392-402. We introduce a new analogue of Bernstein-Stancu operators and we call it as (p,q)-Bernstein-Stancu operators. We study approximation properties based on Korovkin's type approximation theorem of (p,q)-Bernstein-Stancu operators. We also establish some direct theorems.
