In the present paper, we consider (p,q)-analogue of the Beta operators and using it, we propose the integral modification of the generalized Bernstein polynomials. We estimate some direct results on local and global approximation. Also, we illustrate some graphs for the convergence of (p,q)-Bernstein-Durrmeyer operators for different values of the parameters p and q using Mathematica package.
