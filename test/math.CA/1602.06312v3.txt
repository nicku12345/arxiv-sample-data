This deals with the Stancu variant of (p, q)-Sz\'asz-Mirakyan-Baskakov operators. Estimation of moments and establishing few basic approximation results which comprise weighted approximation and direct estimates in view of modulus of continuity is the aim of this paper. Steklov mean method has been used for linear approximation. For the particular case {\alpha} = 0, \b{eta} = 0, we get (p, q) -Sz\'asz-Mirakyan-Baskakov operators.
