In this paper we introduce the Stancu type generalization of the q-Bernstein-Schurer-Kantorovich operators and examine their approximation properties. We investigate the convergence of our operators with the help of the Korovkin's approximation theorem and examine the convergence of these operators in the Lipschitz class of functions. We also investigate the approximation process for these operators through the statistical Korovkin's approximation theorem. Also, we present some direct theorems for these operators. Finally we introduce the bivariate analogue of these operators and study some results for the bivariate case.
