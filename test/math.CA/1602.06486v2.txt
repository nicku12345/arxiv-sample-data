This paper will be devoted to study the two-weight norm inequalities of the multilinear fractional maximal operator \mathcal{M}_{\alpha} and the multilinear fractional integral operator \mathcal{I}_{\alpha}. The entropy conditions in the multilinear setting will be introduced and the entropy bounds for \mathcal{M}_\alpha and \mathcal{I}_\alpha will be given.
