In the present paper, we introduce the generalized form of (p,q) Baskakov-Durrmeyer Operators with Stancu type parameters. We derived the local and global approximation properties of these operators and obtained the convergence rate and behaviour for the Lipschitz functions. Moreover, we give comparisons and some illustrative graphics for the convergence of operators to some function.
