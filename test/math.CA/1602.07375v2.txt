The fundamental set of solutions of the generalized hypergeometric differential equation in the neighborhood of unity has been built by N{\o}rlund in 1955. The behavior of the generalized hypergeometric function in the neighborhood of unity has been described in the beginning of 1990s by B\"uhring, Srivastava and Saigo. In the first part of this paper we review their results rewriting them in terms of Meijer's G-function and explaining the interconnections between them. In the second part we present new formulas and identities for the coefficients that appear in the expansions of Meijer's G-function and generalized hypergeometric function around unity. Particular cases of these identities include known and new relations for Thomae's hypergeometric function and forgotten Hermite's identity for the sine function.
