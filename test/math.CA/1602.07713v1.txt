In this article we prove that if the q-fractional operator (~_{q}\nabla_{qa}^\alpha y)(t) of order 0<\alpha\leq 1 , 0<q<1 and starting at some qa \in T_q=\{q^k: k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\cup \{0\},~~a>0 is positive such that y(a) \geq 0, then y(t) is c_q(\alpha)-increasing, c_q(\alpha)=\frac{1-q^\alpha}{1-q}q^{1-\alpha}. Conversely, if y(t) is increasing and y(a)\geq 0, then (~_{q}\nabla_{qa}^\alpha y)(t)\geq 0. As an application, we proved a q-fractional version of the Mean-Value Theorem.
