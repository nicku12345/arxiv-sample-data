In this paper, the author considers the weighted vector-valued estimate for the operator defined by T_Af(x)={\rm p.\,v.}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{\Omega(x-y)}{|x-y|^{n+1}}\big(A(x)-A(y)-\nabla A(y)\big)f(y){\rm d}y, and the corresponding maximal operator T_A^*, where \Omega is homogeneous of degree zero, has vanishing moment of order one, A is a function in \mathbb{R}^n such that \nabla A\in {\rm BMO}(\mathbb{R}^n). By a pointwise estimate for \|\{T_Af_k(x)\}\|_{l^q} and the weighted L^p estimates for the sparse operator \mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{S},\,L(\log L)^\beta}f(x)=\sum_{Q\in\mathcal{S}}\|f\|_{L(\log L)^{\beta},\,Q}\chi_{Q}(x) , the author establishes some weak and endpoint quantitative weighted vector-valued estimates for T_A and T_A^*.
