Let Q be an infinite subset of \mathbb{Z}, let \Psi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow [0,\infty) be positive on Q, and let \theta \in \mathbb{R}. Define  E(Q,\Psi,\theta) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \| q x - \theta \| \leq \Psi(q) \text{ for infinitely many q \in Q} \}.  We prove a lower bound on the Fourier dimension of E(Q,\Psi,\theta). This generalizes theorems of Kaufman and Bluhm and yields new explicit examples of Salem sets. We give applications to metrical Diophantine approximation, including determining the Hausdorff dimension of E(Q,\Psi,\theta) in new cases. We also prove a higher-dimensional analog of our result.
