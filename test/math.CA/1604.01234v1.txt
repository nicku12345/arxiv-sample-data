Given a positive, decreasing sequence a, whose sum is L, we consider all the closed subsets of [0,L] such that the lengths of their complementary open intervals are in one to one correspondence with the sequence a. The aim of this note is to investigate the possible values that Assouad-type dimensions can attain for this class of sets. In many cases, the set of attainable values is a closed interval whose endpoints we determine.
