We study the sharp constant W_{n}(D) in Wiener's inequality for positive definite functions \[ \int_{\mathbb{T}^{n}}|f|^{2}\,dx\le W_{n}(D)|D|^{-1}\int_{D}|f|^{2}\,dx,\quad D\subset \mathbb{T}^{n}. \] N. Wiener proved that W_{1}([-\delta,\delta])<\infty, \delta\in (0,1/2). E. Hlawka showed that W_{n}(D)\le 2^{n}, where D is an origin-symmetric convex body.   We sharpen Hlawka's estimates for D being the ball B^{n} and the cube I^{n}. In particular, we prove that W_{n}(B^{n})\le 2^{(0.401\ldots +o(1))n}. We also obtain a lower bound of W_{n}(D). Moreover, for a cube  D=\frac1q I^{n} with q=3,4,\ldots, we obtain that W_{n}(D)=2^{n}. Our proofs are based on the interrelation between Wiener's problem and the problems of Tur\'an and Delsarte.
