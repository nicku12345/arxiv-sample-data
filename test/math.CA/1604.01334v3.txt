In recent years, it has been well understood that a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator T is pointwise controlled by a finite number of dyadic operators of a very simple structure (called the sparse operators). We obtain a similar pointwise estimate for the commutator [b,T] with a locally integrable function b. This result is applied into two directions. If b\in BMO, we improve several weighted weak type bounds for [b,T]. If b belongs to the weighted BMO, we obtain a quantitative form of the two-weighted bound for [b,T] due to Bloom-Holmes-Lacey-Wick.
