For subsets of \mathbb R^+ = [0,\infty) we introduce a notion of coherently porous sets as the sets for which the upper limit in the definition of porosity at a point is attained along the same sequence. We prove that the union of two strongly porous at 0 sets is strongly porous if and only if these sets are coherently porous. This result leads to a characteristic property of the intersection of all maximal ideals containing in the family of strongly porous at 0 subsets of \mathbb R^+. It is also shown that the union of a set A \subseteq \mathbb R^+ with arbitrary strongly porous at 0 subset of \mathbb R^+ is porous at 0 if and only if A is lower porous at 0.
