The aim of this paper consists on the study of the following fourth-order operator: \begin{equation}\label{Ec::T4} T[M]\,u(t)\equiv u^{(4)}(t)+p_1(t)\,u"'(t)+p_2(t)\,u"(t)+M\,u(t)\,,\ t\in I \equiv [a,b]\,, \end{equation} coupled with the two point boundary conditions: \begin{equation}\label{Ec::cf} u(a)=u(b)=u"(a)=u"(b)=0\,. \end{equation}   So, we define the following space:   \begin{equation}\label{Ec::esp}   X=\left\lbrace u\in C^4(I)\quad\mid\quad u(a)=u(b)=u"(a)=u"(b)=0 \right\rbrace \,.   \end{equation}   Here p_1\in C^3(I) and p_2\in C^2(I).   By assuming that the second order linear differential equation   \begin{equation}\label{Ec::2or}   L_2\, u(t)\equiv u"(t)+p_1(t)\,u'(t)+p_2(t)\,u(t)=0\,,\quad t\in I,   \end{equation} is disconjugate on I, we characterize the parameter's set where the Green's function related to operator T[M] in X is of constant sign on I \times I. Such characterization is equivalent to the strongly inverse positive (negative) character of operator T[M] on X and comes from the first eigenvalues of operator T[0] on suitable spaces.
