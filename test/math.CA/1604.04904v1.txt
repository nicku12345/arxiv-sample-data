In \cite{csc}, Cetin et al. defined a new special finite sum which is denoted by B_{1}(h,k). In this paper, with the help of the Hardy and Dedekind sums we will give many properties of the sum B_{1}(h,k). Then we will give the connections of this sum with the other well-known finite sums such as the Dedekind sums, the Hardy sums, the Simsek sums Y(h,k) and the sum C_{1}(h,k). By using the Fibonacci numbers and two-term polynomial relation, we will also give a new property of the sum B_{1}(h,k).
