We study a new family of q-Meixner multiple orthogonal polynomials of the first kind. The discrete orthogonality conditions are considered over a non-uniform lattice with respect to different q-analogues of Pascal distributions. We address some algebraic properties, namely raising and lowering operators as well as Rodrigues-type. Based on the explicit expressions for the raising and lowering operator a high-order linear q-difference equation with polynomial coefficients for the q-Meixner multiple orthogonal polynomials of the first kind is obtained. Finally, we obtain the nearest neighbor recurrence relation based on a purely algebraic approach.
