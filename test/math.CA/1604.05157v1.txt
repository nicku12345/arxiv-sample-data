The main aim of this study is to introduce statistical approximation properties of (p; q)-Szasz Mirakjan Kantorovich operators with the help of the Korovkin type statistical approximation theorem. Rates of statistical convergence by means of the modulus of continuity and the Lipschitz type maximal function are also established.
