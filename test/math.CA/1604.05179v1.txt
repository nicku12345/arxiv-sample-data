Let \begin{equation*} A_{q}^{(\alpha)}(a;z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(a;q)_{k} q^{\alpha k^2} z^k} {(q;q)_{k}}, \end{equation*} where \alpha >0,~0<q<1. In a paper of Ruiming Zhang, he asked under what conditions the zeros of the entire function A_{q}^{(\alpha)}(a;z) are all real and established some results on the zeros of A_{q}^{(\alpha)}(a;z) which present a partial answer to that question. In the present paper, we will set up some results on certain entire functions which includes that A_{q}^{(\alpha)}(q^l;z),~l\geq 2 has only infinitely many negative zeros that gives a partial answer to Zhang's question. In addition, we establish some results on zeros of certain entire functions involving the Rogers-Szeg\H{o} polynomials and the Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials.
