In the present study, we have introduced Ces\`{a}ro summability of integrals of fuzzy-number-valued functions and given one-sided Tauberian conditions under which convergence of improper fuzzy Riemann integrals follows from Ces\`{a}ro summability. Also, fuzzy analogues of Schmidt type slow decrease and Landau type one-sided Tauberian conditions have been obtained.
