In this paper, some approximation properties of (p,q)-analogue of Bernstein-Stancu Operators has been studied. Rate of statistical convergence by means of modulus of continuity and Lipschitz type maximal functions has been investigated. Monotonicity of (p,q)-Bernstein-Stancu Operators and a global approximation theorem by means of Ditzian-Totik modulus of smoothness is established. A quantitative Voronovskaja type theorem is developed for these operators.   Furthermore, we show comparisons and some illustrative graphics for the convergence of operators to a function
