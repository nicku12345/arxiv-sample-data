We provide a versatile formulation of Lacey's recent sparse pointwise domination technique with a local weak type estimate on a nontangential maximal function as the only hypothesis. We verify this hypothesis for sharp variational truncations of singular integrals in the case when unweighted L^2 estimates are available. This extends previously known sharp weighted estimates for smooth variational truncations to the case of sharp variational truncations. We also include a sparse domination result for iterated commutators of multilinear operators with BMO functions.
