Let n\ge 1 and \mathfrak{T}_{m} be the bilinear square Fourier multiplier operator associated with a symbol m, which is defined by  \mathfrak{T}_{m}(f_1,f_2)(x) = \biggl( \int_{0}^\infty\Big|\int_{(\mathbb{R}^n)^2} e^{2\pi ix\cdot (\xi_1 +\xi_2) }m(t\xi_1,t\xi_2) \hat{f}_{1}(\xi_1)\hat{f}_{2}(\xi_2)d\xi_1 d\xi_2\Big|^2\frac{dt}{t } \biggr)^{\frac 12}.  Let s be an integer with s\in[n+1,2n] and p_0 be a number satisfying 2n/s\le p_0\le 2. Suppose that \nu_{\vec{\omega}}=\prod_{i=1}^2\omega_i^{p/ p_i} and each \omega_i is a nonnegative function on \mathbb{R}^n. In this paper, we show that \mathfrak{T}_{m} is bounded from L^{p_1}(\omega_1)\times L^{p_2}(\omega_2) to L^p(\nu_{\vec{\omega}}) if p_0< p_1, p_2<\infty with 1/p=1/p_1+ 1/p_2. Moreover, if p_0>2n/s and p_1=p_0 or p_2=p_0, then \mathfrak{T}_{m} is bounded from L^{p_1}(\omega_1)\times L^{p_2}(\omega_2) to L^{p,\infty}(\nu_{\vec{\omega}}). The weighted end-point L\log L type estimate and strong estimate for the commutators of \mathfrak{T}_{m} are also given. These were done by considering the boundedness of some related multilinear square functions associated with mild regularity kernels and essentially improving some basic lemmas which have been used before.
