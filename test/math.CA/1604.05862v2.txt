By observing the equivalence of assertions on determining the jump of a function by its differentiated or integrated Fourier series, we generalize a previous result of Kvernadze, Hagstrom and Shapiro to the whole class of functions of harmonic bounded variation and without finiteness assumption on the number of discontinuities. Two results on determination of jump discontinuities by means of the tails of integrated Fourier-Chebyshev series are derived.
