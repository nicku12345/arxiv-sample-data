This paper treat determinacy of strong moment problems in part I and indeterminacy of strong moment problems in part II. This paper is a summary of the following papers:   [1] Ald\'en. E., Determinacy of Strong Moment Problems. [2] On Indeterminacy of Strong Moment Problems. [3] Indeterminacy of Strong Moment Problems.   This paper will treat determinacy/indeterminacy of the strong Stieltjes and Hamburger moment problems, part I. Indeterminacy, part II, for certain class of distribution functions. We conclude by proving a theorem for indeterminacy of the strong problems above for general distribution functions.
