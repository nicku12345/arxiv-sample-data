We examine the harmonic and geometric maximal operators defined for a general basis of open sets in \R^n. We prove two weight norm inequalities for the harmonic maximal operator assuming testing conditions over characteristic functions of unions of sets from the basis. We also prove a that a bumped two weight A_p-like condition is sufficient for the two weight boundedness of the harmonic maximal operator.
