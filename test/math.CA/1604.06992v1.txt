Let I_{\alpha} be the linear and \mathcal{I}_{\alpha} be the bilinear fractional integral operators. In the linear setting, it is known that the two-weight inequality holds for the first order commutators of I_{\alpha}. But the method can't be used to obtain the two weighted norm inequality for the higher order commutators of I_{\alpha}. In this paper, we first give an alternative proof for the first order commutators of I_{\alpha}. This new approach allows us to consider the higher order commutators. This was done by showing that the commutator [b,I_{\alpha}] can be represented as a finite linear combination of some paraproducts. Then, by using the Cauchy integral theorem, we show that the two-weight inequality holds for the higher order commutators of I_{\alpha}. In the bilinear setting, we present a dyadic proof for the characterization between BMO and the boundedness of [b,\mathcal{I}_{\alpha}]. Moreover, some bilinear paraproducts are also treated in order to obtain the boundedness of [b,\mathcal{I}_{\alpha}].
