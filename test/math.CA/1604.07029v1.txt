We introduce the most general class of linear boundary-value problems for systems of first-order ordinary differential equations whose solutions belong to the complex H\"older space C^{n+1,\alpha}, with 0\leq n\in\mathbb{Z} and 0\leq\alpha\leq1. The boundary conditions can contain derivatives y^{(r)}, with 1\leq r\leq n+1, of the solution y to the system. For parameter-dependent problems from this class, we obtain constructive criterion under which their solutions are continuous in the normed space C^{n+1,\alpha} with respect to the parameter.
