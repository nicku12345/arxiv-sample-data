The main result of this paper is a bi-parameter Tb theorem for Littlewood-Paley g-function, where b is a tensor product of two pseudo-accretive functions. Instead of the doubling measure, we work with a product measure \mu = \mu_n \times \mu_m, where the measures \mu_n and \mu_m are only assumed to be upper doubling. The main techniques of the proof include a bi-parameter b-adapted Haar function decomposition and an averaging identity over good double Whitney regions. Moreover, the non-homogeneous analysis and probabilistic methods are used again.
