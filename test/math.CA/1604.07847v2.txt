A multi-Poisson structure on a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} provides a systematic way to construct completely integrable Hamiltonian systems on \mathfrak{g} expressed in Lax form \partial X_\lambda /\partial t = [X_\lambda , A_\lambda ] in the sense of the isospectral deformation, where X_\lambda , A_\lambda \in \mathfrak{g} depend rationally on the indeterminate \lambda  called the spectral parameter. In this paper, a method for modifying the isospectral deformation equation to the Lax equation \partial X_\lambda /\partial t = [X_\lambda , A_\lambda ] + \partial A_\lambda /\partial \lambda  in the sense of the isomonodromic deformation, which exhibits the Painlev\'e property, is proposed. This method gives a few new Painlev\'e systems of dimension four.
