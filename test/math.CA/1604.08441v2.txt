By applying an integral representation for q^{k^{2}} we systematically derive a large number of new Fourier and Mellin transform pairs and establish new integral representations for a variety of q-functions and polynomials that naturally arise from combinatorics, analysis, and orthogonal polynomials corresponding to indeterminate moment problems. These functions include q-Bessel functions, the Ramanujan function, Stieltjes--Wigert polynomials, q-Hermite and q^{-1}-Hermite polynomials, and the q-exponential functions e_{q}, E_{q} and \mathcal{E}_{q}. Their representations are in turn used to derive many new identities involving q-functions and polynomials. In this work we also present contour integral representations for the above mentioned functions and polynomials.
