The selection of Saffman-Taylor fingers by surface tension has been extensively investigated. In this paper we are concerned with the existence and selection of steadily translating symmetric finger solutions in a Hele-Shaw cell by small but non-zero kinetic undercooling (\epsilon^2 ). We rigorously conclude that for relative finger width \lambda near one half, symmetric finger solutions exist in the asymptotic limit of undercooling \epsilon^2 ~\rightarrow ~0 if the Stokes multiplier for a relatively simple nonlinear differential equation is zero. This Stokes multiplier S depends on the parameter \alpha \equiv \frac{2 \lambda -1}{(1-\lambda)}\epsilon^{-\frac{4}{3}}  and earlier calculations have shown this to be zero for a discrete set of values of \alpha. While this result is similar to that obtained previously for Saffman-Taylor fingers by surface tension, the analysis for the problem with kinetic undercooling exhibits a number of subtleties as pointed out by Chapman and King (2003) [The selection of Saffman-Taylor fingers by kinetic undercooling, Journal of Engineering Mathematics 46, 1-32]. The main subtlety is the behavior of the Stokes lines at the finger tip, where the analysis is complicated by non-analyticity of coefficients in the governing equation.
