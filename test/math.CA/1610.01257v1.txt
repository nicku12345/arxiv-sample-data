In this paper we present a method to obtain deformations of families of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials that are associated to the representation theory of compact Gelfand pairs. These polynomials have the Sturm-Liouville property in the sense that they are simultaneous eigenfunctions of a symmetric second order differential operator and we deform this operator accordingly so that the deformed families also have the Sturm-Liouville property. Our strategy is to deform the system of spherical functions that is related to the matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials and then check that the polynomial structure is respected by the deformation. Crucial in these considerations is the full spherical function \Psi_{0}, which relates the spherical functions to the polynomials. We prove an explicit formula for \Psi_{0} in terms of Krawtchouk polynomials for the Gelfand pair (\mathrm{SU}(2)\times\mathrm{SU}(2),\mathrm{diag}(\mathrm{SU}(2))). For the matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials associated to this pair, a deformation was already available by different methods and we show that our method gives same results using explicit knowledge of \Psi_{0}.   Furthermore we apply our method to some of the examples of size 2\times2 for more general Gelfand pairs. We prove that the families related to the groups \mathrm{SU}(n) are deformations of one another. On the other hand, the families associated to the symplectic groups \mathrm{Sp}(n) give rise to a new family with an extra free parameter.
