In this paper, we study the Painlev\'{e} VI equation with parameter (\frac {9}{8},\frac{-1}{8},\frac{1}{8},\frac{3}{8}). We prove   (i) An explicit formula to count the number of poles of an algebraic solution with the monodromy group D_{N}, where D_{N} is the dihedral group of order 2N.   (ii) There are only four solutions without poles in \mathbb{C}\backslash \left \{ 0,1\right \} .   (iii) If the monodromy group of the associated linear ODE of a solution \lambda \left( t\right)  is unitary, then \lambda ( t)  has no poles in \mathbb{R}% \backslash \{ 0,1\} .
