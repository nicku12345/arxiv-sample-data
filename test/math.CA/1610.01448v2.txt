In this short note we have proved an enhanced version of a theorem of Lorentz [1] and its generalization to the multivariate case which gives a non- uniform estimate of degree of approximation by a polynomial with positive coefficients. The performance of the approximation at the vertices of [0; 1]d is more precisely characterized by the improved result and its multivariate generalization. The latter provides mathematical foundation on which multivariate density approximation by a polynomial with positive coefficients can be established.
