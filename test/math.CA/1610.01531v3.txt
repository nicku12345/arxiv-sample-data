We impose standard  T1 -type assumptions on a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator  T , and deduce that for bounded compactly supported functions  f, g  there is a sparse bilinear form  \Lambda  so that  \lvert \langle T f, g \rangle\rvert \lesssim \Lambda (f,g).  The proof is short and elementary. The sparse bound quickly implies all the standard mapping properties of a Calder\'on-Zygmund on a (weighted)  L ^{p} space.
