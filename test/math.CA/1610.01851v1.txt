Using Mawhin's coincidence degree theory, we obtain some new continuation theorems which are designed to have as a natural application the study of the periodic problem for cyclic feedback type systems. We also discuss some examples of vector ordinary differential equations with a \phi-Laplacian operator where our results can be applied.
