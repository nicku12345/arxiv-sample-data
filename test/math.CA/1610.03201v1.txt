We prove that for radial Fourier multipliers m: \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{C} supported compactly away from the origin, T_m is restricted strong type (p,p) if K=\hat{m} is in L^p(\mathbb{R}^3), in the range 1<p<\frac{13}{12}. We also prove an L^p characterization for radial Fourier multipliers in four dimensions; namely, for radial Fourier multipliers m: \mathbb{R}^4\to\mathbb{C} supported compactly away from the origin, T_m is bounded on L^p(\mathbb{R}^4) if and only if K=\hat{m} is in L^p(\mathbb{R}^4), in the range 1<p<\frac{36}{29}. Our method of proof relies on a geometric argument that exploits bounds on sizes of multiple intersections of three-dimensional annuli to control numbers of tangencies between pairs of annuli in three and four dimensions.
