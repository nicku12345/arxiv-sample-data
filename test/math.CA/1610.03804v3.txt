Given any dimension function h, we construct a perfect set E \subseteq \mathbb{R} of zero h-Hausdorff measure, that contains any finite polynomial pattern.   This is achieved as a special case of a more general construction in which we have a family of functions \mathcal{F} that satisfy certain conditions and we construct a perfect set E in \mathbb{R}^N, of h-Hausdorff measure zero, such that for any finite set \{ f_1,\ldots,f_n\}\subseteq \mathcal{F}, E satisfies that \bigcap_{i=1}^n f^{-1}_i(E)\neq\emptyset.   We also obtain an analogous result for the images of functions. Additionally we prove some related results for countable (not necessarily finite) intersections, obtaining, instead of a perfect set, an \mathcal{F}_{\sigma} set without isolated points.
