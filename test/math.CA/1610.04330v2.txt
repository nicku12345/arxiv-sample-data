A function f:\mathbb{Z}_n \to \mathbb{C} can be represented as a linear combination f(x)=\sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_n}\widehat{f}(\alpha) \chi_{\alpha,n}(x) where \widehat{f} is the (discrete) Fourier transform of f. Clearly, the basis \{\chi_{\alpha,n}(x):=\exp(2\pi i \alpha x/n)\} depends on the value n.   We show that if f has "large" Fourier coefficients, then the function \widetilde{f}:\mathbb{Z}_m \to \mathbb{C}, given by \[   \widetilde{f}(x)   = \begin{cases} f(x) & \text{when } 0\leq x < \min(n, m),   0 & \text{otherwise},   \end{cases} \] also has "large" coefficients. Moreover, they are all contained in a "small" interval around \lfloor \frac{m}{n}\alpha \rceil for each \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_n such that \widehat{f}(\alpha) is large. One can use this result to recover the large Fourier coefficients of a function f by redefining it on a convenient domain. One can also use this result to reprove a result by Morillo and R{\`a}fols: \emph{single-bit} functions, defined over any domain, have a small set of large coefficients.
