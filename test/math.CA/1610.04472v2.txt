The coefficients that appear in uniform asymptotic expansions for integrals are typically very complicated. In the existing literature the majority of the work only give the first two coefficients. In a limited number of papers where more coefficients are given the evaluation of the coefficients near the coalescence points is normally highly numerically unstable. In this paper, we illustrate how well-known Cauchy type integral representations can be used to compute the coefficients in a very stable and efficient manner. We discuss the cases: (i) two coalescing saddles, (ii) two saddles coalesce with two branch points, (iii) a saddle point near an endpoint of the interval of integration. As a special case of (ii) we give a new uniform asymptotic expansion for Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(z) in terms of Laguerre polynomials L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) as n\to\infty that holds uniformly for z near 1. Several numerical illustrations are included.
