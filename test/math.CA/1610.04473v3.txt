In this paper we introduce a finite field analogue of a Lauricella hypergeometric series. An integral formula for the Lauricella hypergeometric series and its finite field analogue are deduced. Transformation and reduction formulae and several generating functions for the Lauricella hypergeometric series over finite fields are obtained. Some of these generalize certain results of Li \emph{et al} and Greene as well as several other known results.
