We prove that the maximal operator associated with variable homogeneous planar curves (t, u t^{\alpha})_{t\in \mathbb{R}}, \alpha\not=1 positive, is bounded on L^p(\mathbb{R}^2) for each p>1, under the assumption that u:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R} is a Lipschitz function. Furthermore, we prove that the Hilbert transform associated with (t, ut^{\alpha})_{t\in \mathbb{R}}, \alpha\not=1 positive, is bounded on L^p(\mathbb{R}^2) for each p>1, under the assumption that u:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} is a measurable function and is constant in the second variable. Our proofs rely on stationary phase methods, TT^* arguments, local smoothing estimates and a pointwise estimate for taking averages along curves.
