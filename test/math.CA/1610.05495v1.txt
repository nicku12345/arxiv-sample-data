In 1935, P. Tur\'an proved that  S_{n,a}(x)= \sum_{j=1}^n{n+a-j\choose n-j} \sin(jx)>0 \quad{(n,a\in\mathbf{N}; 0<x<\pi).}  We present various related inequalities. Among others, we show that the refinements  S_{2n-1,a}(x)\geq \sin(x) \quad\mbox{and} \quad{S_{2n,a}(x)\geq 2\sin(x)(1+\cos(x))}  are valid for all integers n\geq 1 and real numbers a\geq 1 and x\in(0,\pi). Moreover, we apply our theorems on sine sums to obtain inequalities for the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.
