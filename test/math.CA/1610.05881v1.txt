The principal aim of this article is to establish an iteration method on the space of resurgent functions. We discuss endless continuability of iterated convolution products of resurgent functions and derive their estimates developing the method in arXiv:1610.05453. Using the estimates, we show the resurgence of formal series solutions of nonlinear differential and difference equations.
