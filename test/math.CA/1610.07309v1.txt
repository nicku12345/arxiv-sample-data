In this paper we study the local zero behavior of orthogonal polynomials around an algebraic singularity, that is, when the measure of orthogonality is supported on  [-1,1]  and behaves like  h(x)|x - x_0|^\lambda dx  for some  x_0 \in (-1,1) , where  h(x)  is strictly positive and analytic. We shall sharpen the theorem of Yoram Last and Barry Simon and show that the so-called fine zero spacing (which is known for  \lambda = 0) unravels in the general case, and the asymptotic behavior of neighbouring zeros around the singularity can be described with the zeros of the function  c J_{\frac{\lambda - 1}{2}}(x) + d J_{\frac{\lambda + 1}{2}}(x) , where  J_a(x)  denotes the Bessel function of the first kind and order  a . Moreover, using Sturm-Liouville theory, we study the behavior of this linear combination of Bessel functions, thus providing estimates for the zeros in question.
