In this paper we formulate embedding maps into time-frequency space related to the Carleson operator and its variational counterpart. We prove bounds for these embedding maps by iterating the outer measure theory of [DT15]. Introducing iterated outer L^p spaces is a main novelty of this paper.   [DT15] Yen Do and Christoph Thiele.
