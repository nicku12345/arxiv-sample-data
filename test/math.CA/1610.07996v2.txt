We consider the most general class of linear boundary-value problems for ordinary differential systems, of order r\geq1, whose solutions belong to the complex space C^{(n+r)}, with 0\leq n\in\mathbb{Z}. The boundary conditions can contain derivatives of order l, with r\leq l\leq n+r, of the solutions. We obtain a constructive criterion under which the solutions to these problems are continuous with respect to the parameter in the normed space C^{(n+r)}. We also obtain a two-sided estimate for the degree of convergence of these solutions.
