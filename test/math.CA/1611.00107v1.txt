We study oscillatory integrals in several variables with analytic, smooth, or C^k phases satisfying a nondegeneracy condition attributed to Varchenko. With only real analytic methods, Varchenko's estimates are rediscovered and generalized. The same methods are pushed further to obtain full asymptotic expansions of such integrals with analytic and smooth phases, and finite expansions with error assuming the phase is only C^k. The Newton polyhedron appears naturally in the estimates; in particular, we show precisely how the exponents appearing in the asymptotic expansions depend only on the geometry of the Newton polyhedron of the phase. All estimates proven hold for oscillatory parameter real and nonzero, not just asymptotically.
