In this paper some new series and integral representations for the Tur\'anian of modified Bessel functions of the first kind are given, which give new asymptotic expansions and tight bounds for the Tur\'an determinant in the question. It is shown that in the case of natural and real order the Tur\'anian can be represented in a relatively compact form, which yields a uniform upper bound for the Tur\'an determinant for modified Bessel functions of the first kind. Our results complement and improve some of the results from the literature.
