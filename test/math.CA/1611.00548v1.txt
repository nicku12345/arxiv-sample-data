A new uniform asymptotic expansion for the incomplete gamma function \Gamma(a,z) valid for large values of z was given by the author in {\it J. Comput. Appl. Math.} {\bf 148} (2002) 323--339. This expansion contains a complementary error function of an argument measuring transition across the point z=a, with easily computable coefficients that do not involve a removable singularity in the neighbourhood of this point. In this note we correct a misprint in the listing of certain coefficients in this expansion and discuss in more detail the situation corresponding to \Gamma(a,a).
