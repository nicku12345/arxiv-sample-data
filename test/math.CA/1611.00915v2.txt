We give a characterization of all Parseval wavelet frames arising from a given frame multiresolution analysis. As a consequence, we obtain a description of all Parseval wavelet frames associated with a frame multiresolution analysis. These results are based on a version of Unitary Extension Principle and Oblique Extension Principle with the assumption that the origin is a point of approximate continuity of the Fourier transform of the involved refinable functions.
