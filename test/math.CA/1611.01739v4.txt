We consider the space A(\mathbb{T}^d) of absolutely convergent Fourier series on the torus \mathbb{T}^d. The norm on A(\mathbb{T}^d) is naturally defined by \|f\|_{A}=\|\widehat{f}\|_{l^1}, where \widehat{f} is the Fourier transform of a function f. For real functions \varphi of a certain special form on \mathbb T^d, \,d\geq 2, we obtain lower bounds for the norms \|e^{i\lambda\varphi}\|_A as \lambda\rightarrow\infty. In particular, we show that if \varphi(x, y)=a(x)|y| for |y|\leq\pi, where a\in A(\mathbb{T}) is an arbitrary nonconstant real function, then \|e^{i\lambda\varphi}\|_{A(\mathbb{T}^2)}\gtrsim |\lambda|.
