We obtain order estimates of approximation of functions from the classes S^{\Omega}_{p,\theta}B (\mathbb{R}^d) in the space L_q(\mathbb{R}^d), 1<p<q<\infty, by entire functions of exponential type with supports of their Fourier transforms in sets generated by the level surfaces of a function \Omega.
