To prove Fourier restriction estimate using polynomial partitioning, Guth introduced the concept of k-broad part of regular L^p norm and obtained sharp k-broad restriction estimates. To go from k-broad estimates to regular L^p estimates, Guth employed l^2 decoupling result. In this article, similar to the technique introduced by Bourgain-Guth, we establish an analogue to go from regular L^p norm to its (m+1)-broad part, as the error terms we have the restricted k-broad parts (k=2,\cdots,m). To analyze the restricted k-broadness, we prove an l^p decoupling result, which can be applied to handle the error terms and recover Guth's linear restriction estimates.
