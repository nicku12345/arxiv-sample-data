In this work in progress, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the p-quantile of the Beta distribution, i.e. the quantity q defined implicitly by \int_0^q t^{a - 1} (1 - t)^{b - 1} \text{d} t = p B (a, b), as a function of the first parameter a. In particular, we derive asymptotic expansions of and q and its logarithm at 0 and \infty. Moreover, we provide some relations between Bell and N{\o}rlund Polynomials, a generalisation of Bernoulli numbers. Finally, we provide Maple and Sage algorithms for computing the terms of the asymptotic expansions.
