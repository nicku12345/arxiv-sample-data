We prove that  \|X(|u|^2)\|_{L^3_{t,\ell}}\leq C\|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)}^2,  where u(x,t) is the solution to the linear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation on \mathbb{R}^2 with initial datum f, and X is the (spatial) X-ray transform on \mathbb{R}^2. In particular, we identify the best constant C and show that a datum f is an extremiser if and only if it is a gaussian. We also establish bounds of this type in higher dimensions d, where the X-ray transform is replaced by the k-plane transform for any 1\leq k\leq d-1. In the process we obtain sharp L^2(\mu) bounds on Fourier extension operators associated with certain high-dimensional spheres, involving measures \mu supported on natural "co-k-planarity" sets.
