We introduce a class of operators on abstract measure spaces, which unifies the Calder\'on-Zygmund operators on spaces of homogeneous type, the maximal functions and the martingale transforms. We prove that such operators can be dominated by simple sparse operators with a definite form of the domination constant. Applying these estimates, we improve several results obtained by different authors in recent years.
