In this paper we study some properties of Takagi functions and their level sets. We show that for Takagi functions T_{a,b} with parameters a,b such that ab is a root of a Littlewood polynomial, there exist large level sets. As a consequence we show that for some parameters a,b, the Assouad dimension of graphs of T_{a,b} is strictly larger than their upper box dimension. In particular we can find weak tangents of those graphs with large Hausdorff dimension, larger than the upper box dimension of the graphs.
