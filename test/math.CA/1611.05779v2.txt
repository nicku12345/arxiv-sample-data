It is rather unexpected, but true, that it is possible to construct reproducing formulae and orthonormal bases of L^2 (\mathbb{R}^2) just by applying the standard one dimensional wavelet action of translations and dilations to the first variable x_1 of the generating function \psi(x_1,x_2), \psi \in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^2), i.e., by making use of building blocks \psi_{u,s}(x_1,x_2)=s^{-1/2}\psi\left(\frac{x_1-u}{s},x_2\right), \text{where } u\in \mathbb{R}, s>0, in the case of reproducing formulae, and \psi_{k,m}(x_1,x_2)=2^{-k/2} \psi\left(\frac{x_1-2^k m}{2^k},x_2 \right), \text{where } k,m\in \mathbb{Z}, in the case of orthonormal bases. It is possible to compensate the fact, that the second variable x_2 is not acted upon, by a careful selection of the generating function \psi. Shannon wavelet tiling of the time-frequency plane \mathbb{R}^2, a standard illustration of orthogonality and completeness phenomena corresponding to the Shannon wavelet,  \chi_{(2^km,2^k(m+1)]}(x) \chi_{2^{-k}I}(\xi),\, k,m\in \mathbb{Z}, \,I=- (1/2,1]\cup (1/2,1],  with x representing time and \xi frequency, is substituted by a phase space tiling of \mathbb{R}^4 with unbounded, hyperboloid type blocks of the form  \chi_{(2^km,2^k(m+1)]}(x_1)\sum_{n,l}\chi_{2^{-k}I_{D(n,l)}}(\xi_1) \chi_{(n,n+1]}(x_2)\chi_{(l,l+1]}(\xi_2),\, k,m\in \mathbb{Z}  where I_r=2^{-r}I,  r\ge 1, and D:\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} is a bijection, an additional parameter of the generating function, needed for the lift from L^2(\mathbb{R}) to L^2(\mathbb{R}^2). Variables x_1,x_2 are coordinates of position and variables \xi_1,\xi_2 of momentum.
