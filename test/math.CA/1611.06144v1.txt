We build a connection between rough path theory and noncommutative algebra, and interpret the integration of geometric rough paths as an example of a non-abelian Young integration. We identify a class of slowly-varying one-forms, and prove that the class is stable under basic operations. In particular rough path theory is extended to allow a natural class of time varying integrands.
