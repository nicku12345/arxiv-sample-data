The paper studies logarithmic convexity and concavity of the generalized hypergeometric function with respect to simultaneous shift of several parameters. We use integral representations and properties of Meijer's G function to prove log-convexity. When all parameters are shifted we use series manipulations to examine the power series coefficients of the generalized Tur\'{a}nian formed by the generalized hypergeometric function. In cases when all zeros of the generalized hypergeometric function are real, we further explore the consequences of the extended Laguerre inequalities and formulate a conjecture about reality of zeros.
