This paper treats two functional equations, the Kannppan-Van Vleck functional equation \mu(y)f(x\tau(y)z_0)\pm f(xyz_0) =2f(x)f(y), \;x,y\in S and the following variant of it   \mu(y)f(\tau(y)xz_0)\pm f(xyz_0) = 2f(x)f(y), \;x,y\in S, in the setting of semigroups S that need not be abelian or unital, \tau is an involutive morphism of S, \mu : S\longrightarrow \mathbb{C} is a multiplicative function such that \mu(x\tau(x))=1 for all x\in S and z_0 is a fixed element in the center of S. We find the complex-valued solutions of these equations in terms of multiplicative functions and solutions of d'Alembert's functional equation.
