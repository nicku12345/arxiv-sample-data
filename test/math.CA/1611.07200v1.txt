In this paper we construct explicit connection coefficients and monodromy representations for the canonical solution matrices of Okubo systems {\rm II}^*, {\rm III}^*, {\rm IV} and {\rm IV}^* of ordinary differential equations in Yokoyama's list. This work is a continuation of our previous work arXiv:1606.07187.
