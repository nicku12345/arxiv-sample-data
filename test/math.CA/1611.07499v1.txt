This paper introduces and studies a generalization of the \mathtt{k}-Bessel function of order \nu given by \[\mathtt{W}^{\mathtt{k}}_{\nu, c}(x):= \sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{(-c)^r}{\Gamma_{\mathtt{k}}\left( r \mathtt{k} +\nu+\mathtt{k}\right) r!} \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{2r+\frac{\nu}{\mathtt{k}}}. \] Representation formulae are derived for \mathtt{W}^{\mathtt{k}}_{\nu, c}. Further the function \mathtt{W}^{\mathtt{k}}_{\nu, c} is shown to be a solution of a second order differential equation. Monotonicity and log-convexity properties for the generalized \mathtt{k}-Bessel function \mathtt{W}^{\mathtt{k}}_{\nu, c} are investigated, particularly in the case c=-1. Several inequalities, including the Tur\'an-type inequality are established.
