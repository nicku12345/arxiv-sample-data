The sequence \{\,_2\phi_1(q^{-k},q^{b+1};\,q^{-\overline{b}-k+1};\, q, q^{-\overline{b}+1/2} z)\}_{k \geq 0} of basic hypergeometric polynomials is known to be orthogonal on the unit circle with respect to the weight function |(q^{1/2}e^{i\theta};\,q)_{\infty}/(q^{b+1/2}e^{i\theta};\,q)_{\infty}|^2. This result, where one must take the parameters q and b to be 0 < q < 1 and \Re(b) > -1/2, is due to P.I. Pastro \cite{Pastro-1985}. In the present manuscript we deal with the orthogonal polynomials \hat{\Phi}_{n}(b;.) and \check{\Phi}_{n}(b;.) on the unit circle with respect to the two parametric families of weight functions \hat{\omega}(b; \theta) = |(e^{i\theta};\,q)_{\infty}/(q^{b}e^{i\theta};\,q)_{\infty}|^2 and \check{\omega}(b;\theta) = |(qe^{i\theta};\,q)_{\infty}/(q^{b}e^{i\theta};\,q)_{\infty}|^2, where 0 < q < 1 and \Re(b) > 0. With the use of the basic hypergeometric polynomials  _2\phi_1(q^{-k},q^{b};\,q^{-\overline{b}-k+1};\, q, q^{-\overline{b}+1} z), k \geq 0, which have zeros on the unit circle when \Re(b) > 0, simple expressions for the (monic) polynomials \hat{\Phi}_{n}(b;.) and \check{\Phi}_{n}(b;.), their norms, the associated Verblunsky coefficients and also the respective Szeg\H{o} functions are found.
