We aim to introduce a \mathtt{k}-Struve function and investigate its various properties, including mainly certain inequalities associated this function. One of the inequalities given here is pointed out to be related to the so-called classical Tur\'an type inequality. We also present a differential equation, several recurrence relations, and integral representations for this \mathtt{k}-Struve function.
