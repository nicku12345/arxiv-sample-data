We develop the Benkhettou-Hassani-Torres fractional (noninteger order) calculus on time scales by proving two chain rules for the \alpha-fractional derivative and five inequalities for the \alpha-fractional integral. The results coincide with well-known classical results when the operators are of (integer) order \alpha = 1 and the time scale coincides with the set of real numbers.
