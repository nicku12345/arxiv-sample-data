Let M_{n,r}=(\sum_{i=1}^{n}q_ix_i^r)^{\frac {1}{r}}, r \neq 0 and M_{n,0}=\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}M_{n,r} be the weighted power means of n non-negative numbers x_i with q_i > 0 satisfying \sum^n_{i=1}q_i=1. In particular, A_n=M_{n,1}, G_n=M_{n,0} are the arithmetic and geometric means of these numbers, respectively. A result of Diananda shows that \begin{align*} M_{n,1/2}-qA_n-(1-q)G_n & \geq 0,\\ M_{n,1/2}-(1-q)A_n-qG_n & \leq 0,\end{align*} where q=\min q_i. In this paper, we prove analogue inequalities in the reversed direction.
