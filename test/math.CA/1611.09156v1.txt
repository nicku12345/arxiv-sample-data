We describe a new subclass of the class of real polynomials with real simple roots called self-interlacing polynomials. This subclass is isomorphic to the class of real Hurwitz stable polynomials (all roots in the open left half-plane). In the work, we present basic properties of self-interlacing polynomials and their relations with Hurwitz and Hankel matrices as well as with Stiltjes type of continued fractions. We also establish "self-interlacing" analogues of the well-known Hurwitz and Li\'enard-Chipart criterions for stable polynomials. A criterion of Hurwitz stability of polynomials in terms of minors of certain Hankel matrices is established.
