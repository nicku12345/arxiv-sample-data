A new generalization called \mathtt{k}-Struve function and its properties given by Nisar and saiful very recently. In this paper, we establish the pathway fractional integral representation of \mathtt{k}-Struve function. Many special cases also established to obtain the pathway integral representation of classical Struve function.
