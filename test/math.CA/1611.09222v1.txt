This short note contains a few comments and corrections about some recent models for the spread of rumors in a population. We consider a system of ordinary differential equations which describes the evolution of Ignorant-Spreaders-Stiflers in time. State of the art of analytical understanding of those equations is based on studying asymptotic solutions of the rumor spreading equations. In this work we find a First Integral of these differential equations. We qualitatively discuss the evolution of the system in the light of those new more precise solutions.
