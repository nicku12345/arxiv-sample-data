Let 0 \leq s \leq 1. A set K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} is a Furstenberg s-set, if for every unit vector e \in S^{1}, some line L_{e} parallel to e satisfies \dim_{\mathrm{H}} [K \cap L_{e}] \geq s. The Furstenberg set problem, introduced by T. Wolff in 1999, asks for the best lower bound for the dimension of Furstenberg s-sets. Wolff proved that \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \geq \max\{s + 1/2,2s\} and conjectured that \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \geq (1 + 3s)/2. The only known improvement to Wolff's bound is due to Bourgain, who proved in 2003 that \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \geq 1 + \epsilon for Furstenberg 1/2-sets K, where \epsilon > 0 is an absolute constant. In the present paper, I prove a similar \epsilon-improvement for all 1/2 < s < 1, but only for packing dimension: \dim_{\mathrm{p}} K \geq 2s + \epsilon for all Furstenberg s-sets K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}, where \epsilon > 0 only depends on s.   The proof rests on a new incidence theorem for finite collections of planar points and tubes of width \delta > 0. As another corollary of this theorem, I obtain a small improvement for Kaufman's estimate from 1968 on the dimension of exceptional sets of orthogonal projections. Namely, I prove that if K \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} is a linearly measurable set with positive length, and 1/2 < s < 1, then \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \{e \in S^{1} : \dim_{\mathrm{p}} \pi_{e}(K) \leq s\} \leq s - \epsilon for some \epsilon > 0 depending only on s. Here \pi_{e} is the orthogonal projection onto the line spanned by e.
