In this paper we prove that the so--called entropy equation, i.e., \[ H\left(x, y, z\right)=H\left(x+y, 0, z\right)+H\left(x, y, 0\right) \] is stable in the sense of Hyers and Ulam on the positive cone of \mathbb{R}^{3}, assuming that the function H is approximatively symmetric in each variable and approximatively homogeneous of degree \alpha, where \alpha is an arbitrarily fixed real number.
