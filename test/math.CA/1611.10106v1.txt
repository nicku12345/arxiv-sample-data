The main aim of this paper is the investigation of the stability problem for ordinary delay differential equations. More precisely, we would like to study the following problem. Assume that for a continuous function a given delay differential equation is fulfilled only approximately. Is it true that in this case this function is close to an exact solution of this delay differential equation?
