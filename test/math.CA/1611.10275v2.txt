The Strichartz estimates for Schr\"{o}dinger equations can be improved when the data is spread out in either physical or frequency space. In this paper we give refinements of the 2-dimensional homogeneous Strichartz estimate on the maximum size of a single wave packet. Different approaches are used in the proofs, including arithmetic approaches, polynomial partitioning, and the l^2 Decoupling Theorem, for different cases. We also give examples to show that the refinements we obtain cannot be further improved when 2 \leq p \leq 4 and p = 6.
