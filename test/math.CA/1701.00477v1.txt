Let \phi be a smooth function on a compact interval I. Let \gamma(t)=\left (t,t^2,\cdots,t^{n-1},\phi(t)\right). In this paper, we show that \left(\int_I \big|\hat f(\gamma(t))\big|^q \big|\phi^{(n)}(t)\big|^{\frac{2}{n(n+1)}} dt\right)^{1/q}\le C\|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb R^n)} holds in the range 1\le p<\frac{n^2+n+2}{n^2+n},\quad 1\le q<\frac{2}{n^2+n}p'. This generalizes an affine restriction theorem of Sj\"olin (1974) for n=2. Our proof relies on ideas of Sj\"olin (1974) and Drury (1985), and more recently Bak-Oberlin-Seeger (2008) and Stovall (2016), as well as a variation bound for smooth functions.
