In this paper we introduce the Two Parameter Gamma Function, Beta Function and Pochhammer Symbol. We named them, as p - k Gamma Function, p - k Beta Function and p - k Pochhammer Symbol and denoted as _{p}\Gamma_{k}(x),  _{p}B_{k}(x,y)  and _{p}(x)_{n,k}  respectively. We prove the several identities for _{p}\Gamma_{k}(x),  _{p}B_{k}(x,y)  and _{p}(x)_{n,k}  those satisfied by the classical Gamma, Beta and Pochhammer Symbol. Also we provide the integral representation for the _{p}\Gamma_{k}(x)  and _{p}B_{k}(x,y) .
