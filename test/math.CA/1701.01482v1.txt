We consider a signal reconstruction problem for signals F of the form  F(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{d}a_{j}\delta\left(x-x_{j}\right), from their moments m_k(F)=\int x^kF(x)dx. We assume m_k(F) to be known for k=0,1,\ldots,N, with an absolute error not exceeding \epsilon > 0.   We study the "geometry of error amplification" in reconstruction of F from m_k(F), in situations where two neighboring nodes x_i and x_{i+1} near-collide, i.e x_{i+1}-x_i=h \ll 1. We show that the error amplification is governed by certain algebraic curves S_{F,i}, in the parameter space of signals F, along which the first three moments m_0,m_1,m_2 remain constant.
