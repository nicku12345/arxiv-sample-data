We determine the asymptotic behavior of the l_{p}-norms of the sequence of Taylor coefficients of b^{n}, where b=\frac{z-\lambda}{1-\bar{\lambda}z} is an automorphism of the unit disk, p\in[1,\infty], and n is large. It is known that in the parameter range p\in[1,2] a sharp upper bound \begin{align*} \left|\!\left|b^{n}\right|\!\right|_{l_{p}^A}\leq C_{p}n^{\frac{2-p}{2p}} \end{align*} holds. In this article we find that this estimate is valid even when p\in[1,4). We prove that \begin{align*} \left|\!\left|b^{n}\right|\!\right|_{l_{4}^A}\leq C_{4}\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \end{align*} and for p\in(4,\infty] that \begin{align*} \left|\!\left|b^{n}\right|\!\right|_{l_{p}^A}\leq C_{p}n^{\frac{1-p}{3p}} & . \end{align*} We prove that our upper bounds are sharp as n tends to \infty i.e. they have the correct asymptotic n dependence.
