For the family P:=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_n of complex polynomials in the variable x we study its {\em discriminant} R:=Res(P,P',x), R\in \mathbb{C}[a], a=(a_1,\ldots ,a_n). When R is regarded as a polynomial in a_k, one can consider its discriminant \tilde{D}_k:=Res(R,\partial R/\partial a_k,a_k). We show that \tilde{D}_k=c_k(a_n)^{d(n,k)}M_k^2T_k^3, where c_k\in \mathbb{Q}^*, d(n,k):=\min (1,n-k)+\max (0,n-k-2), the polynomials M_k,T_k\in \mathbb{C}[a^k] have integer coefficients, a^k=(a_1,\ldots ,a_{k-1},a_{k+1},\ldots ,a_n), the sets \{ M_k=0\} and \{ T_k=0\} are the projections in the space of the variables a^k of the closures of the strata of the variety \{ R=0\} on which P has respectively two double roots or a triple root. Set P_k:=P-xP'/(n-k) for 1\leq k\leq n-1 and P_n:=P'. One has T_k={\rm Res}(P_k,P_k',x) for k\neq n-1 and T_{n-1}={\rm Res}(P_{n-1},P_{n-1}',x)/a_n.
