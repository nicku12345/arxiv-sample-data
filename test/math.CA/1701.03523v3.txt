We prove that recent breaking by Zahl of the \frac32 barrier in Wolff's estimate on the Kakeya maximal operator in \mathbb R^4 leads to improving the \frac{14}{5} threshold for the restriction problem for the paraboloid in \mathbb R^4. One of the ingredients is a new trilinear estimate. The proofs are deliberately presented in a nontechnical and concise format, so as to make the arguments more readable and focus attention on the key tools.
