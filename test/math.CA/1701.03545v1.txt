In this paper, we investigate optimal linear approximations (n-approximation numbers ) of the embeddings from the Sobolev spaces H^r\ (r>0) for various equivalent norms and the Gevrey type spaces G^{\alpha,\beta}\ (\alpha,\beta>0) on the sphere \Bbb S^d and on the ball \Bbb B^d, where the approximation error is measured in the L_2-norm. We obtain preasymptotics, asymptotics, and strong equivalences of the above approximation numbers as a function in n and the dimension d. We emphasis that all equivalence constants in the above preasymptotics and asymptotics are independent of the dimension d and n. As a consequence we obtain that for the absolute error criterion the approximation problems I_d: H^{r}\to L_2 are weakly tractable if and only if r>1, not uniformly weakly tractable, and do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We also prove that for any \alpha,\beta>0, the approximation problems I_d: G^{\alpha,\beta}\to L_2 are uniformly weakly tractable, not polynomially tractable, and quasi-polynomially tractable if and only if \alpha\ge 1.
