Our aim in this paper is to show some new inequalities for Mathieu's type series and Riemann zeta function. In particular, some Tur\'an type inequalities, some monotonicity and log-convexity results for these special functions are given. New Laplace type integral representations for Mathie type series and Riemann zeta function are also presented.
