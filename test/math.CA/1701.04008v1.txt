We derive solvability conditions and closed-form solution for the Weber type integral equation, related to the familiar Weber-Orr integral transforms and the old Weber-Titchmarsh problem (posed in Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 22 (2) (1924), pp.15, 16), recently solved by the author. Our method involves properties of the inverse Mellin transform of integrable functions. The Mellin-Parseval equality and some integrals, involving the Gauss hypergeometric function are used.
