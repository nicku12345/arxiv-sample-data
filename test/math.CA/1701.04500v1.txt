Let \mu be a measure in \mathbb R^d with compact support and continuous density, and let  R^s\mu(x)=\int\frac{y-x}{|y-x|^{s+1}}\,d\mu(y),\ \ x,y\in\mathbb R^d,\ \ 0<s<d.  We consider the following conjecture:  \sup_{x\in\mathbb R^d}|R^s\mu(x)|\le C\sup_{x\in\text{supp}\,\mu}|R^s\mu(x)|,\quad C=C(d,s).  This relation was known for d-1\le s<d, and is still an open problem in the general case. We prove the maximum principle for 0< s<1, and also for 0<s<d in the case of radial measure. Moreover, we show that this conjecture is incorrect for non-positive measures.
