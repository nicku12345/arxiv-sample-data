This research paper treats fractional kinetic equations using the Sumudu transform operator. The exact solutions obtained are presented in terms of Struve functions of four parameters. By way of obtaining solutions some novel and useful and novel kinetic theorems are presented in light of the Sumudu properties. Results obtained in this study may be pragmatically used in many branches theoretical and experimental science applications, not the least of which are mathematical physics, and various engineering fields.
