For fixed real numbers c>0, \alpha>-\frac{1}{2}, the finite Hankel transform operator, denoted by \mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha} is given by the integral operator defined on L^2(0,1) with kernel K_{\alpha}(x,y)= \sqrt{c xy} J_{\alpha}(cxy). To the operator \mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha}, we associate a positive, self-adjoint compact integral operator \mathcal Q_c^{\alpha}=c\, \mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha}\, \mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha}. Note that the integral operators \mathcal{H}_c^{\alpha} and \mathcal Q_c^{\alpha} commute with a Sturm-Liouville differential operator \mathcal D_c^{\alpha}.   In this paper, we first give some useful estimates and bounds of the eigenfunctions \vp of \mathcal H_c^{\alpha} or \mathcal Q_c^{\alpha}. These estimates and bounds are obtained by using some special techniques from the theory of Sturm-Liouville operators, that we apply to the differential operator \mathcal D_c^{\alpha}. If   (\mu_{n,\alpha}(c))_n and \lambda_{n,\alpha}(c)=c\, |\mu_{n,\alpha}(c)|^2 denote the infinite and countable sequence of the eigenvalues of the operators \mathcal{H}_c^{(\alpha)} and \mathcal Q_c^{\alpha}, arranged in the decreasing order of their magnitude, then we show an unexpected result that for a given integer n\geq 0, \lambda_{n,\alpha}(c) is decreasing with respect to the parameter \alpha. As a consequence, we show that for \alpha\geq \frac{1}{2}, the \lambda_{n,\alpha}(c) and the \mu_{n,\alpha}(c) have a super-exponential decay rate. Also, we give a lower decay rate of these eigenvalues. As it will be seen, the previous results are essential tools for the analysis of a spectral approximation scheme based on the eigenfunctions of the finite Hankel transform operator. Some numerical examples will be provided to illustrate the results of this work.
