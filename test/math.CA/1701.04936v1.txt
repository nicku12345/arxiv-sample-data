Let v \ne 0 be a vector in \R^n.   Consider the Laplacian on \R^n with drift \Delta_{v} = \Delta + 2v\cdot \nabla and the measure d\mu(x) = e^{2 \langle v, x \rangle} dx, with respect to which \Delta_{v} is self-adjoint. This measure has exponential growth with respect to the Euclidean distance. We study weak type (1, 1) and other sharp endpoint estimates for the Riesz transforms of any order, and also for the vertical and horizontal Littlewood-Paley-Stein functions associated with the heat and the Poisson semigroups.
