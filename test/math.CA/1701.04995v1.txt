Given a nontrivial positive measure \mu on the unit circle, the associated Christoffel-Darboux kernels are K_n(z, w;\mu) = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\overline{\varphi_{k}(w;\mu)}\,\varphi_{k}(z;\mu), n \geq 0, where \varphi_{k}(\cdot; \mu) are the orthonormal polynomials with respect to the measure \mu. Let the positive measure \nu on the unit circle be given by d \nu(z) = |G_{2m}(z)|\, d \mu(z), where G_{2m} is a conjugate reciprocal polynomial of exact degree 2m. We establish a determinantal formula expressing \{K_n(z,w;\nu)\}_{n \geq 0} directly in terms of \{K_n(z,w;\mu)\}_{n \geq 0}.   Furthermore, we consider the special case of w=1; it is known that appropriately normalized polynomials K_n(z,1;\mu)  satisfy a recurrence relation whose coefficients are given in terms of two sets of real parameters  \{c_n(\mu)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} and  \{g_{n}(\mu)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, with 0<g_n<1  for n\geq 1. The double sequence \{(c_n(\mu), g_{n}(\mu))\}_{n=1}^{\infty} characterizes the measure \mu. A natural question about the relation between the parameters c_n(\mu), g_n(\mu), associated with \mu, and the sequences c_n(\nu), g_n(\nu), corresponding to \nu, is also addressed.   Finally, examples are considered, such as the Geronimus weight (a measure supported on an arc of the unit circle), a class of measures given by basic hypergeometric functions, and a class of measures with hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials.
