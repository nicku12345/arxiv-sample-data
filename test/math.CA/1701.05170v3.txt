In this paper we provide weighted estimates for rough operators, including rough homogeneous singular integrals T_\Omega with \Omega\in L^\infty(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}) and the Bochner-Riesz multiplier at the critical index B_{(n-1)/2}. More precisely, we prove qualitative and quantitative versions of Coifman-Fefferman type inequalities and their vector-valued extensions, weighted A_p-A_\infty strong and weak type inequalities for 1<p<\infty, and A_1-A_\infty type weak (1,1) estimates. Moreover, Fefferman-Stein type inequalities are obtained, proving in this way a conjecture raised by the second-named author in the 90's. As a corollary, we obtain the weighted A_1-A_\infty type estimates. Finally, we study rough homogenous singular integrals with a kernel involving a function \Omega\in L^q(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}), 1<q<\infty, and provide Fefferman-Stein inequalities too. The arguments used for our proofs combine several tools: a recent sparse domination result by Conde-Alonso et.al. [CACDPO], results by the first author in [L], suitable adaptations of Rubio de Francia algorithm, the extrapolation theorems for A_{\infty} weights [CMP,CGMP] and ideas contained in previous works by A. Seeger in [S] and D. Fan and S. Sato [FS].
