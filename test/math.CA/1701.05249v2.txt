For polynomial  P (x,y), and any Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund kernel, K, the operator below satisfies a  (1,r) sparse bound, for  1< r \leq 2.  \sup _{\epsilon >0} \Bigl\lvert \int_{|y| > \epsilon} f (x-y) e ^{2 \pi i P (x,y) } K(y) \; dy \Bigr\rvert  The implied bound depends upon  P (x,y) only through the degree of  P. We derive from this a range of weighted inequalities, including weak type inequalities on  L ^{1} (w), which are new, even in the unweighted case. The unweighted weak-type estimate, without maximal truncations, is due to Chanillo and Christ (1987).
