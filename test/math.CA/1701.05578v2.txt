The goal in the paper is to advertise Dunkl extension of Szasz beta type operators. We initiate approximation features via acknowledged Korovkin and weighted Korovkin theorem and obtain the convergence rate from the point of modulus of continuity, second order modulus of continuity, the Lipschitz class functions, Peetre's K-functional and modulus of weighted continuity by Dunkl generalization of Szasz beta type operators.
