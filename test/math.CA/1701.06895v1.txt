The purpose of this note is to discuss several results that have been obtained in the last decade in the context of sharp adjoint Fourier restriction/Strichartz inequalities. Rather than aiming at full generality, we focus on several concrete examples of underlying manifolds with large groups of symmetries, which sometimes allows for simple geometric proofs. We mention several open problems along the way, and include an appendix on integration on manifolds using delta calculus.
