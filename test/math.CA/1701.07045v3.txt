We establish new linear and trilinear bounds for collections of tubes in \mathbb{R}^4 that satisfy the polynomial Wolff axioms. In brief, a collection of \delta-tubes satisfies the Wolff axioms if not too many tubes can be contained in the \delta-neighborhood of a plane. A collection of tubes satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms if not too many tubes can be contained in the \delta-neighborhood of a low degree algebraic variety.   First, we prove that if a set of \delta^{-3} tubes in \mathbb{R}^4 satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms, then the union of the tubes must have volume at least \delta^{1-1/40}. We also prove a more technical statement which is analogous to a maximal function estimate at dimension 3+1/40. Second, we prove that if a collection of \delta^{-3} tubes in \mathbb{R}^4 satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms, and if most triples of intersecting tubes point in three linearly independent directions, then the union of the tubes must have volume at least \delta^{3/4}. Again, we also prove a slightly more technical statement which is analogous to a maximal function estimate at dimension 3+1/4.   We conjecture that every Kakeya set satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms, but we are unable to prove this. If our conjecture is correct, it implies a Kakeya maximal function estimate at dimension 3+1/40, and in particular this implies that every Kakeya set in \mathbb{R}^4 must have Hausdorff dimension at least 3+1/40. This would be an improvement over the current best bound of 3, which was established by Wolff in 1995.
