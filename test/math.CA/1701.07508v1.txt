In this paper, we first introduce some new kinds of weighted amalgam spaces. Then we discuss the strong type and weak type estimates for a class of Calder\'on--Zygmund type operators T_\theta in these new weighted spaces. Furthermore, the strong type estimate and endpoint estimate of linear commutators [b,T_{\theta}] formed by b and T_{\theta} are established. Also we study related problems about two-weight, weak type inequalities for T_{\theta} and [b,T_{\theta}] in the weighted amalgam spaces and give some results.
