In this note we prove a multilinear version of the reverse H\"older inequality in the theory of Muckenhoupt A_p weights. We give two applications of this inequality to the study of multilinear weighted norm inequalities. First, we prove a structure theorem for multilinear A_{\vec{p}} weights; second, we give a new sufficient condition for multilinear, two-weight norm inequalities for the maximal operator.
