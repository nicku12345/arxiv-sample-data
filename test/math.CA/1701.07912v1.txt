If a real polynomial f(x)=p(x^2)+xq(x^2) is Hurwitz stable (every root if f lies in the open left half-plane), then the Hermite-Biehler Theorem says that the polynomials p(-x^2) and q(-x^2) have interlacing real roots. We extend this result to general polynomials by giving a lower bound on the number of real roots of p(-x^2) and q(-x^2) and showing that these real roots interlace. This bound depends on the number of roots of f which lie in the left half plane. Another classical result in the theory of polynomials is Descartes' Rule of Signs, which bounds the number of positive roots of a polynomial in terms of the number of sign changes in its coefficients. We use our extension of the Hermite-Biehler Theorem to give an inverse rule of signs for polynomials with one positive root.
