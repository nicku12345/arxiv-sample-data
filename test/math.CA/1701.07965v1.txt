Taking as model the attractor of an iterated function system consisting of phi-contractions on a complete and bounded metric space, we introduce the set-theoretic concept of family of functions having attractor. We prove that, given such a family, there exist a metric on the set on which the functions are defined and take values and a comparison function phi such that all the family's functions are phi-contractions. In this way we obtain a generalization for a finite family of functions of the converse of Browder's fixed point theorem. As byproducts we get a particular case of Bessaga's theorem concerning the converse of the contraction principle and a companion of Wong's result which extends the above mentioned Bessaga's result for a finite family of commuting functions with common fixed point.
