The purpose of the present paper is to investigate some structural and qualitative aspects of two different perturbations of the parameters of g-fractions. In this context the concept of \emph{gap} g-fractions is introduced. While tail sequences of a continued fraction play a significant role in the first perturbation, Schur fractions are used in the second perturbation of the g-parameters that are considered. Illustrations are provided using Gaussian hypergeometric functions. Using a particular gap g-fraction, some members of the class of Pick functions are also identified.
