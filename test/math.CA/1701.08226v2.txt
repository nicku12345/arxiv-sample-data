Let \Gamma be a crystal group in \mathbb R^d. A function \varphi:\mathbb R^d\longrightarrow \mathbb C is said to be {\em crystal-refinable} (or \Gamma-refinable) if it is a linear combination of finitely many of the rescaled and translated functions \varphi(\gamma^{-1}(ax)), where the {\em translations} \gamma are taken on a crystal group \Gamma, and a is an expansive dilation matrix such that a\Gamma a^{-1}\subset\Gamma. A \Gamma-refinable function \varphi: \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb C satisfies a refinement equation \varphi(x)=\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}d_\gamma \varphi(\gamma^{-1}(ax)) with d_\gamma \in \mathbb C. Let \mathcal S(\varphi) be the linear span of \{\varphi(\gamma^{-1}(x)): \gamma \in \Gamma\} and \mathcal{S}^h=\{f(x/h):f\in\mathcal{S(\varphi)}\}. One important property of \mathcal S(\varphi) is, how well it approximates functions in L^2(\mathbb R^d). This property is very closely related to the {\em crystal-accuracy} of \mathcal S(\varphi), which is the highest degree p such that all multivariate polynomials q(x) of {\rm degree}(q)<p are exactly reproduced from elements in \mathcal S(\varphi). In this paper, we determine the accuracy p from the coefficients d_\gamma. Moreover, we obtain from our conditions, a characterization of accuracy for a particular lattice refinable vector function F, which simplifies the classical conditions.
