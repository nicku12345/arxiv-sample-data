We consider infinite conformal iterated function systems on \mathbb{R}^d. We study the geometric structure of the limit set of such systems. Suppose this limit set intersects some l-dimensional C^1-submanifold with positive Hausdorff t-dimensional measure, where 0<l<d and t is the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set. We then show that the closure of the limit set belongs to some l-dimensional affine subspace or geometric sphere whenever d exceeds 2 and analytic curve if d equals 2.
