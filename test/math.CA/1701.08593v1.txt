Let X be a metric measure space with an s-regular measure \mu. We prove that if A\subset X is \varrho-porous, then \dim_{\mathrm{p}}(A)\le s-c\varrho^s where \dim_{\mathrm{p}} is the packing dimension and c is a positive constant which depends on s and the structure constants of \mu. This is an analogue of a well known asymptotically sharp result in Euclidean spaces. We illustrate by an example that the corresponding result is not valid if \mu is a doubling measure. However, in the doubling case we find a fixed N\subset X with \mu(N)=0 such that \dim_{\mathrm{p}}(A)\le\dim_{\mathrm{p}}(X)-c(\log\tfrac 1\varrho)^{-1}\varrho^t for all \varrho-porous sets A\subset X\setminus N. Here c and t are constants which depend on the structure constant of \mu. Finally, we characterize uniformly porous sets in complete s-regular metric spaces in terms of regular sets by verifying that A is uniformly porous if and only if there is t<s and a t-regular set F such that A\subset F.
