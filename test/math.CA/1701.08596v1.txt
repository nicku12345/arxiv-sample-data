This is a report of a joint work with E. J\"arvenp\"a\"a, M. J\"arvenp\"a\"a, T. Rajala, S. Rogovin, and V. Suomala. In [3], we characterized uniformly porous sets in s-regular metric spaces in terms of regular sets by verifying that a set A is uniformly porous if and only if there is t < s and a t-regular set F \supset A. Here we outline the main idea of the proof and also present an alternative proof for the crucial lemma needed in the proof of the result.
