We present an application of the recently developed ergodic theoretic machinery on scenery flows to a classical geometric measure theoretic problem in Euclidean spaces. We also review the enhancements to the theory required in our work. Our main result is a sharp version of the conical density theorem, which we reduce to a question on rectifiability.
