In this paper we introduce new class of multiplicative interactions of the \zeta-oscillating systems generated by a subset of power functions. The main result obtained expresses an analogue of prime decomposition (without the property of uniqueness).   Dedicated to recalling of Nicola Tesla's oscillators
