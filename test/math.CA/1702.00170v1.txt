Let X=\{x_i:i\in\mathbb{Z}\}, \dots<x_{i-1}<x_i<x_{i+1}<\dots, be a sampling set which is separated by a constant \gamma>0. Under certain conditions on \phi, it is proved that if there exists a positive integer \nu such that \delta_\nu:=\sup\limits_{i\in\mathbb{Z}}(x_{i+\nu}-x_i)<\dfrac{\nu}{2\pi}\left(\dfrac{c_{k}^2}{M_{2k}}\right)^{\frac{1}{4k}}, then every function belonging to a shift-invariant space V(\phi) can be reconstructed stably from its nonuniform sample values \{f^{(j)}(x_i):j=0,1,\dots, k-1, i\in\mathbb{Z}\}, where c_k is a Wirtinger-Sobolev constant and M_{2k} is a constant in Bernstein-type inequality of V(\phi). Further, when k=1, the maximum gap \delta_\nu<\nu is sharp for certain shift-invariant spaces.
