We provide L^p \to L^q refinements on some Fourier restriction estimates obtained using polynomial partitioning. Let S\subset \mathbb{R}^3 be a compact C^\infty surface with strictly positive second fundamental form. We derive sharp L^p(S) \to L^q(\mathbb{R}^3) estimates for the associated Fourier extension operator for q> 3.25 and q\geq 2p' from an estimate of Guth that was used to obtain L^\infty(S) \to L^q(\mathbb{R}^3) bounds for q>3.25. We present a slightly weaker result when S is the hyperbolic paraboloid in \mathbb{R}^3 based on the work of Cho and Lee. Finally, we give some refinements for the truncated paraboloid in higher dimensions.
