We aim to present two new generalized integral formulae involving product of generalized Struve function \mathcal{W}_{p,b,c}\left( z\right), which are expressed in terms of the generalized Lauricella functions. The main results presented here, being the very general character, reduce to yield known and new integral formulae. Some special cases of our main results are also considered.
