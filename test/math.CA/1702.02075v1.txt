We prove that if \Omega\subset \mathbb R^n is a bounded open set and n\alpha> {\rm dim}_b (\partial \Omega) = d, then the Brouwer degree deg(v,\Omega,\cdot) of any H\"older function v\in C^{0,\alpha}\left (\Omega, \mathbb R^{n}\right) belongs to the Sobolev space W^{\beta, p} (\mathbb R^n) for every 0\leq \beta < \frac{n}{p} - \frac{d}{\alpha}. This extends a summability result of Olbermann and in fact we get, as a byproduct, a more elementary proof of it. Moreover we show the optimality of the range of exponents in the following sense: for every \beta\geq 0 and p\geq 1 with \beta > \frac{n}{p} - \frac{n-1}{\alpha} there is a vector field v\in C^{0, \alpha} (B_1, \mathbb R^n) with \mbox{deg}\, (v, \Omega, \cdot)\notin W^{\beta, p}, where B_1 \subset \mathbb R^n is the unit ball.
