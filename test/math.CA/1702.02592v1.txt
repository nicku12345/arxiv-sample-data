When addressing ordinary differential equations in infinite dimensional Banach spaces, an interesting question that arises concerns the existence (or non existence) of blowing up solutions in finite time. In this manuscript we discuss this question for the fractional differential equation cD_t^\alpha u = f(t,u) proving that when f is locally Lipschitz, however does not maps bounded sets into bounded sets, we can construct a maximal local solution that not "blows up" in finite time.
