Let \varphi be a nonnegative integrable function on (0,\infty). It is well-known that the Hausdorff operator \mathcal H_\varphi generated by \varphi is bounded on the real Hardy space H^1(\mathbb R). The aim of this paper is to give the exact norm of \mathcal H_\varphi. More precisely, we prove that \|\mathcal H_\varphi\|_{H^1(\mathbb R)\to H^1(\mathbb R)}= \int_0^\infty \varphi(t)dt.
