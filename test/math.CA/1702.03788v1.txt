The paper studies logarithmic convexity and concavity of power series with coefficients involving q-gamma functions or q-shifted factorials with respect to a parameter contained in their arguments. The principal motivating examples of such series are basic hypergeometric functions. We consider four types of series. For each type we establish conditions sufficient for the power series coefficients of the generalized Tur\'anian formed by these series to have constant sign. Finally, we furnish seven examples of basic hypergeometric functions satisfying our general theorems. This investigation extends our previous results on power series with coefficient involving the ordinary gamma functions and the shifted factorials.
