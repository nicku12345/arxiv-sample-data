We establish L^p-L^q estimates for averaging operators associated to mixed homogeneous polynomial hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^3. These are described in terms of the mixed homogeneity and the order of vanishing of the polynomial hypersurface and its Gaussian curvature transversally to their zero sets.
