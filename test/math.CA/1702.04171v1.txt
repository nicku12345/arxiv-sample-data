In this paper we introduce new class of nonlinear interactions of \zeta-oscillating systems. The main formula is generated by corresponding subset of the set of trigonometric functions. Next, the main formula generates certain set of two-parts forms. For this set the following holds true: the cube of two-part form is asymptotically equal to other two-part form -- short functional algebra.
