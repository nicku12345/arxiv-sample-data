We investigate the problem of pointwise convergence of the family of non-linear integral operators: \begin{equation} L_\lambda(f,x) = \int_a^b \sum_{m=1}^N f^m(t) K_{\lambda ,m}(x,t) dt, \end{equation} where \lambda  is a real parameters, K_{\lambda ,m}(x,t) is non-negative kernel and f is the function in L_{1}(a,b). We consider two cases where % (a,b) is a finite interval and when is the whole real axis.
