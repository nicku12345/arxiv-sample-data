We prove the matrix A_2 conjecture for the dyadic square function, that is, a norm estimate of the matrix weighted square function, where the focus is on the sharp linear dependence on the matrix A_2 constant in the estimate. Moreover, we give a mixed estimate in terms of A_2 and A_{\infty} constants. Key is a sparse domination of a process inspired by the integrated form of the matrix--weighted square function.
