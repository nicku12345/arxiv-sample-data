We prove weighted estimates for rough bilinear singular integral operators with kernel K(y_1, y_2) = \frac{\Omega((y_1,y_2)/|(y_1,y_2)|)}{|(y_1, y_2)|^{2d}}, where y_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d} and \Omega \in L^{\infty}(S^{2d-1}) with \int_{S^{2d-1}}\Omega d\sigma = 0. The argument is by sparse domination of rough bilinear operators, via an abstract theorem that is a multilinear generalization of recent work by Conde-Alonso, Culiuc, Di Plinio and Ou. We also use recent results due to Grafakos, He, and Honz\'{\i}k for the application to rough bilinear operators. In particular, since the weighted estimates are proved via sparse domination, we obtain some quantitative estimates in terms of the A_{p} characteristics of the weights. The abstract theorem is also shown to apply to multilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators with a standard smoothness assumption. Due to the generality of the sparse domination theorem, future applications not considered in this paper are expected.
