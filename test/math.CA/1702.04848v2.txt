We provide a direct proof of the following theorem of Kalton, Hollenbeck, and Verbitsky \cite{HKV}: let H be the Hilbert transform and let a,b be real constants. Then for 1<p<\infty the norm of the operator aI+bH from L^p(\mathbb R) to L^p(\mathbb R) is equal to  \bigg(\max_{x\in \Bbb R}\frac{|ax-b+(bx+a)\tan \frac{\pi}{2p}|^p+|ax-b-(bx+a)\tan \frac{\pi}{2p}|^p}{|x+\tan \frac{\pi}{2p}|^p+|x-\tan \frac{\pi}{2p}|^p} \bigg)^{\frac 1p}.  Our proof avoids passing through the analogous result for the conjugate function on the circle, as in \cite{HKV}, and is given directly on the line. We also provide new approximate extremals for aI+bH in the case p>2.
