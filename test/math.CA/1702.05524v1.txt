The article considers the generalized k-Bessel functions and represents it as Wright functions. Then we study the monotonicity properties of the ratio of two different orders k- Bessel functions, and the ratio of the k-Bessel and the m-Bessel functions. The log-convexity with respect to the order of the k-Bessel also given. An investigation regarding the monotonicity of the ratio of the k-Bessel and k-confluent hypergeometric functions are discussed.
