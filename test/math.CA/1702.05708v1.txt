We describe the symbolic calculus of operators on the unit sphere in the complex n-space \mathbb C^n defined by the Berezin quantization. In particular, we derive a explicit formula for the composition of Berezin symbol and with that a noncommutative star product. In the way is necessary introduce a holomorphic spaces which admit a reproducing kernel in the form of generalized hypergeometric series.
