We represent Mat\'ern functions in terms of Schoenberg's integrals which ensure the positive definiteness and prove the systems of translates of Mat\'ern functions form Riesz sequences in L^2(\R^n) or Sobolev spaces. Our approach is based on a new class of integral transforms that generalize Fourier transforms for radial functions. We also consider inverse multi-quadrics and obtain similar results.
