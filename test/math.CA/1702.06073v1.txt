In this work, we obtain a Lyapunov-type and a Hartman-Wintner-type inequalities for a linear and a nonlinear fractional differential equation with generalized Hilfer operator subject to Dirichlet-type boundary conditions. We prove existence of positive solutions to a nonlinear fractional boundary value problem. As an application, we obtain a lower bound for the eigenvalues of corresponding equations.
