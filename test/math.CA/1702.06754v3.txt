We study the boundedness problem for maximal operators \mathbb{M} associated to averages along families of finite type curves in the plane, defined by \mathbb{M}f(x) \, := \, \sup_{1 \leq t \leq 2} \left|\int_{\mathbb{C}} f(x-ty) \, \rho(y) \, d\sigma(y)\right|, where d\sigma denotes the normalised Lebesgue measure over the curves \mathbb{C}. Let \triangle be the closed triangle with vertices P=(\frac{2}{5}, \frac{1}{5}), ~ Q=(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}), ~ R=(0, 0). In this paper, we prove that for (\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}) \in (\triangle \setminus \{P, Q\}) \cap \left\{(\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}) :q > m \right\}, there is a constant B such that \|\mathbb{M}f\|_{L^q(\mathbb{R}^2)} \leq \, B \, \|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^2)}. Furthermore, if m <5, then we have \|\mathbb{M}f\|_{L^{5, \infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)} \leq B \|f\|_{L^{\frac{5}{2} ,1} (\mathbb{R}^2)}. We shall also consider a variable coefficient version of maximal theorem and we obtain the L^p-L^q boundedness result for  (\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}) \in \triangle^{\circ} \cap \left\{(\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}) :q > m \right\}, where \triangle^{\circ} is the interior of the triangle with vertices (0,0), ~(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}), ~(\frac{2}{5}, \frac{1}{5}). An application is given to obtain L^p-L^q estimates for solution to higher order, strictly hyperbolic pseudo-differential operators.
