We prove that the classical one-parameter convolution singular integrals on the Heisenberg group are bounded on multiparameter flag Hardy spaces, which satisfy `intermediate' dilation between the one-parameter anisotropic dilation and the product dilation on \mathbb{C}^{n}\times \mathbb{R} implicitly.
