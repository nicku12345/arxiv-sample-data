We investigate the sharp L^p\to L^r estimates for the restricted averaging operator A_C over the cone C of the d-dimensional vector space F_q^d over the finite field F_q with q elements. The restricted averaging operator A_C for the cone C is defined by the relation that A_Cf=f\ast \sigma |_C, where \sigma denotes the normalized surface measure on the cone C, and f is a complex valued function on the space F_q^d with the normalized counting measure dx. In the previous work, the sharp boundedness of A_C was obtained in odd dimensions d\ge 3 but partial results were only given in even dimensions d\ge 4. In this paper we prove the optimal estimates in even dimensions d\ge 6 in the case when the cone C\subset F_q^d contains a d/2 dimensional subspace.
