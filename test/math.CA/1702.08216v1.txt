For the family of polynomials in one variable P:=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_n, n\geq 4, we consider its higher-order discriminant sets \{ \tilde{D}_m=0\}, where \tilde{D}_m:=Res(P,P^{(m)}), m=2, \ldots, n-2, and their projections in the spaces of the variables a^k:=(a_1,\ldots ,a_{k-1},a_{k+1},\ldots ,a_n). Set P^{(m)}:=\sum _{j=0}^{n-m}c_ja_jx^{n-m-j}, P_{m,k}:=c_kP-x^mP^{(m)}. We show that Res(\tilde{D}_m,\partial \tilde{D}_m/\partial a_k,a_k)= A_{m,k}B_{m,k}C_{m,k}^2, where A_{m,k}=a_n^{n-m-k}, B_{m,k}=Res(P_{m,k},P_{m,k}') if 1\leq k\leq n-m and A_{m,k}=a_{n-m}^{n-k}, B_{m,k}=Res(P^{(m)},P^{(m+1)}) if n-m+1\leq k\leq n. The equation C_{m,k}=0 defines the projection in the space of the variables a^k of the closure of the set of values of (a_1,\ldots ,a_n) for which P and P^{(m)} have two distinct roots in common. The polynomials B_{m,k},C_{m,k}\in \mathbb{C}[a^k] are irreducible. The result is generalized to the case when P^{(m)} is replaced by a polynomial P_*:=\sum _{j=0}^{n-m}b_ja_jx^{n-m-j}, 0\neq b_i\neq b_j\neq 0 for i\neq j.
