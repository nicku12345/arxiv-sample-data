A formula for the non-elementary integral \int e^{\lambda x^\alpha} dx where \alpha is real and greater or equal two, is obtained in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function _1F_1. This result is verified by directly evaluating the area under the Gaussian Bell curve, corresponding to \alpha = 2, using the asymptotic expression for the confluent hypergeometric function and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC). Two different but equivalent expressions, one in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function _1F_1 and another one in terms of the hypergeometric function _1F_2, are obtained for each of these integrals, \int \cosh(\lambda x^\alpha)dx, \int \sinh(\lambda x^\alpha)dx, \int \cos(\lambda x^\alpha)dx and \int \sin(\lambda x^\alpha)dx, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}, \alpha\ge2. And the hypergeometric function _1F_2 is expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function _1F_1. Some of the applications of the non-elementary integral \int e^{\lambda x^\alpha}dx,\alpha\ge2 such as the Gaussian distribution and the Maxwell-Bortsman distribution are given.
