We develop a new point of view to introduce families of functions, which can be identified as generalization of the ordinary trigonometric or hyperbolic functions. They are defined using a procedure based on umbral methods, inspired to the Bessel Calculus of Bochner, Cholewinsky and Haimo. We propose further extensions of the method and of the relevant concepts as well and obtain new families of integral transform allowing the framing of the previous concepts within the context of generalized Borel tranforms.
