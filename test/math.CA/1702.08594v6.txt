We consider the averages of a function  f on  \mathbb R ^{n} over spheres of radius  0< r< \infty  given by  A_{r} f (x) = \int_{\mathbb S ^{n-1}} f (x-r y) \; d \sigma (y), where  \sigma  is the normalized rotation invariant measure on  \mathbb S ^{n-1}. We prove a sharp range of sparse bounds for two maximal functions, the first the lacunary spherical maximal function, and the second the full maximal function.  M_{{lac}} f = \sup_{j\in \mathbb Z } A_{2^j} f , \qquad M_{{full}} f = \sup_{ r>0 } A_{r} f .  The sparse bounds are very precise variants of the known L^p bounds for these maximal functions. They are derived from known  L ^{p}-improving estimates for the localized versions of these maximal functions, and the indices in our sparse bound are sharp. We derive novel weighted inequalities for weights in the intersection of certain Muckenhoupt and reverse H\"older classes.
