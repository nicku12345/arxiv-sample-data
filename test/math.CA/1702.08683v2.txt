In this paper we study some properties of anisotropic Orlicz and anisotropic Orlicz-Sobolev spaces of vector valued functions for a special class of G-functions. We introduce a variational setting for a class of Lagrangian Systems. We give conditions which ensure that the principal part of variational functional is finitely defined and continuously differentiable on Orlicz-Sobolev space.
