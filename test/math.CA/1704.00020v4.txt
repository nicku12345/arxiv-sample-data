We list A_n, C_n and D_n extensions of the elliptic WP Bailey transform and lemma, given for n=1 by Andrews and Spiridonov. Our work requires multiple series extensions of Frenkel and Turaev's terminating, balanced and very-well-poised {}_{10}V_9 elliptic hypergeometric summation formula due to Rosengren, and Rosengren and Schlosser. In our study, we discover two new A_n {}_{12}V_{11} transformation formulas, that reduce to two new A_n extensions of Bailey's _{10}\phi_9 transformation formulas when the nome p is 0, and two multiple series extensions of Frenkel and Turaev's sum.
