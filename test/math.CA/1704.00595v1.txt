We have recently established some integral inequalities for convex functions via the Hermite-Hadamard's inequalities. In continuation here, we also establish some interesting new integral inequalities for convex functions via the Hermite--Hadamard's inequalities and Jensen's integral inequality. Useful applications involving special means are also included.
