Our aim is to characterize the Lipschitz functions by variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. We give some characterizations of the boundedness of the maximal or nonlinear commutators of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function and sharp maximal function in variable exponent Lebesgue spaces when the symbols b belong to the Lipschitz spaces, by which some new characterizations of Lipschitz spaces and nonnegative Lipschitz functions are obtained. Some equivalent relations between the Lipschitz norm and the variable exponent Lebesgue norm are also given.
