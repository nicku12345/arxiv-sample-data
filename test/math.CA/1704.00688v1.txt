Following the works of Lyons and Oberlin, Seeger, Tao, Thiele and Wright, we relate the variation of certain discrete curves on the Lie group \text{SU}(1,1) to the corresponding variation of their linearized versions on the Lie algebra. Combining this with a discrete variational Menshov-Paley-Zygmund theorem, we establish a variational Hausdorff-Young inequality for a discrete version of the nonlinear Fourier transform on \text{SU}(1,1).
