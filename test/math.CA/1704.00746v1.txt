We establish in this paper the equivalence between a Volterra integral equation of second kind and a singular ordinary differential equation of third order with two initial conditions and an integral boundary condition, with a real parameter. This equivalence allow us to obtain the solution to some problems for nonclassical heat equation, the continuous dependence of the solution with respect to the parameter and the corresponding explicit solution to the considered problem.
