Let \sigma be arc-length measure on S^1\subset \mathbb R^2 and \Theta denote rotation by an angle \theta \in (0, \pi]. Define a model bilinear generalized Radon transform, B_{\theta}(f,g)(x)=\int_{S^1} f(x-y)g(x-\Theta y)\, d\sigma(y), an analogue of the linear generalized Radon transforms of Guillemin and Sternberg \cite{GS} and Phong and Stein (e.g., \cite{PhSt91,St93}). Operators such as B_\theta are motivated by problems in geometric measure theory and combinatorics. For \theta<\pi, we show that B_{\theta}: L^p({\Bbb R}^2) \times L^q({\Bbb R}^2) \to L^r({\Bbb R}^2) if \left(\frac{1}{p},\frac{1}{q},\frac{1}{r}\right)\in Q, the polyhedron with the vertices (0,0,0), (\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, 1), (0, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}), (\frac{2}{3},0,\frac{1}{3}), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) and (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}), except for \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right), where we obtain a restricted strong type estimate. For the degenerate case \theta=\pi, a more restrictive set of exponents holds. In the scale of normed spaces, p,q,r \ge 1, the type set Q is sharp. Estimates for the same exponents are also proved for a class of bilinear generalized Radon transforms in \mathbb R^2 of the form  B(f,g)(x)=\int \int \delta(\phi_1(x,y)-t_1)\delta(\phi_2(x,z)-t_2) \delta(\phi_3(y,z)-t_3) f(y)g(z) \psi(y,z) \, dy\, dz,  where \delta denotes the Dirac distribution, t_1,t_2,t_3\in\mathbb R, \psi is a smooth cut-off and the defining functions \phi_j satisfy some natural geometric assumptions.
