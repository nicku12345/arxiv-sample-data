We study the singularity (multifractal) spectrum of continuous convex functions defined on [0,1]^{d}. Let E_f({h})  be the set of points at which f has a pointwise exponent equal to h. We first obtain general upper bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of these sets E_f(h), for all convex functions f and all h\geq 0. We prove that for typical/generic (in the sense of Baire) continuous convex functions f:[0,1]^{d}\to \mathbb{R} , one has \dim E_f(h) =d-2+h for all h\in[1,2], and in addition, we obtain that the set  E_f({h} ) is empty if h\in (0,1)\cup (1,+\infty). Also, when f is typical, the boundary of [0,1]^{d} belongs to E_{f}({0}).
