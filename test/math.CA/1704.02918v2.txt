Let D be a nonnegative integer and {\mathbf{\Theta}}\subset S^1 be a lacunary set of directions of order D. We show that the L^p norms, 1<p<\infty, of the maximal directional Hilbert transform in the plane  H_{{\mathbf{\Theta}}} f(x):= \sup_{v\in {\mathbf{\Theta}}} \Big|\mathrm{p.v.}\int_{\mathbb R }f(x+tv)\frac{\mathrm{d} t}{t}\Big|, \qquad x \in {\mathbb R}^2,  are comparable to (\log\#{\mathbf{\Theta}})^\frac{1}{2}. For vector fields \mathsf{v}_D with range in a lacunary set of of order D and generated using suitable combinations of truncations of Lipschitz functions, we prove that the truncated Hilbert transform along the vector field \mathsf{v}_D,  H_{\mathsf{v}_D,1} f(x):= \mathrm{p.v.} \int_{ |t| \leq 1 } f(x+t\mathsf{v}_D(x)) \,\frac{\mathrm{d} t}{t},  is L^p-bounded for all 1<p<\infty. These results extend previous bounds of the first author with Demeter, and of Guo and Thiele.
