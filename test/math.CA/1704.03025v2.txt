New upper bounds on the pointwise behaviour of Christoffel function on convex domains in {\mathbb{R}}^d are obtained. These estimates are established by explicitly constructing the corresponding "needle"-like algebraic polynomials having small integral norm on the domain, and are stated in terms of few easy-to-measure geometric characteristics of the location of the point of interest in the domain. Sharpness of the results is shown and examples of applications are given.
