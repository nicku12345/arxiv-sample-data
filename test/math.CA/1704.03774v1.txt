We consider the most general class of linear boundary-value problems for higher-order ordinary differential systems whose solutions and right-hand sides belong to the corresponding Sobolev spaces. For parameter-dependent problems from this class, we obtain a constructive criterion under which their solutions are continuous in the Sobolev space with respect to the parameter. We also obtain a two-sided estimate for the degree of convergence of these solutions to the solution of the nonperturbed problem. These results are applied to a new broad class of parameter-dependent multipoint boundary-value problems.
