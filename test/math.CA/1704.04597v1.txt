In their paper, Braides, Buttazzo and Fragala proved the density of Riemannian energies in the class of Finsler energy functionals with respect to \Gamma-convergence in the one-dimensional case. In this thesis we prove that one of the main tools in that paper, a homogenization theorem, can be extended to arbitrary dimension, however, the density result cannot be generalized to higher dimensions. In fact, we construct counterexamples that show: there are anisotropic energy functionals, such as Finsler energies, Cartan functionals and their dominance functionals that cannot be \Gamma-approximated by Riemannian energies.
