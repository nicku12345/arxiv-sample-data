We obtain sufficient conditions for convergence (almost everywhere) of multiple trigonometric Fourier series of functions f in L_2 in terms of Weyl multipliers. We consider the case where rectangular partial sums of Fourier series S_n(x;f) have indices n=(n_1,\dots,n_N) \in \mathbb Z^N, N\ge 3, in which k (1\leq k\leq N-2) components on the places \{j_1,\dots,j_k\}=J_k \subset \{1,\dots,N\} = M are elements of (single) lacunary sequences (i.e., we consider the, so called, multiple Fourier series with J_k-lacunary sequence of partial sums). We prove that for any sample J_k\subset M the Weyl multiplier for convergence of these series has the form W(\nu)=\prod \limits_{j=1}^{N-k} \log(|\nu_{{\alpha}_j}|+2), where \alpha_j\in M\setminus J_k , \nu=(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_N)\in{\mathbb Z}^N. So, the "one-dimensional" Weyl multiplier -- \log(|\cdot|+2) -- presents in W(\nu) only on the places of "free" (nonlacunary) components of the vector \nu. Earlier, in the case where N-1 components of the index n are elements of lacunary sequences, convergence almost everywhere for multiple Fourier series was obtained in 1977 by M.Kojima in the classes L_p, p>1, and by D.K.Sanadze, Sh.V.Kheladze in Orlizc class. Note, that presence of two or more "free" components in the index n (as follows from the results by Ch.Fefferman (1971)) does not guarantee the convergence almost everywhere of S_n(x;f) for N\geq 3 even in the class of continuous functions.
