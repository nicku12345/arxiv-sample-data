By means of classical fixed point index, we prove new results on the existence, non-existence, localization and multiplicity of nontrivial solutions for systems of Hammerstein integral equations where the nonlinearities are allowed to depend on the first derivative. As a byproduct of our theory we discuss the existence of positive solutions of a system of third order ODEs subject to nonlocal boundary conditions. Some examples are provided in order to illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results.
