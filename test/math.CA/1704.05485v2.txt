We obtain improved Fourier restriction estimate for the truncated cone using the method of polynomial partitioning in dimension n\geq 3, which in particular solves the cone restriction conjecture for n=5, and recovers the sharp range for 3\leq n\leq 4. The main ingredient of the proof is a k-broad estimate for the cone extension operator, which is a weak version of the k-linear cone restriction estimate for 2\leq k\leq n.
