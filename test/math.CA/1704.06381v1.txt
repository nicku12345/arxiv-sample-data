We prove an inequality for Jacobi polynomials that \begin{align} \Delta_n(x):=P_n^{(\alpha_n,\beta_n)}(x)P_n^{(\alpha_{n+1},\beta_{n+1})}(x)- P_{n-1}^{(\alpha_n,\beta_n)}(x)P_{n+1}^{(\alpha_{n+1},\beta_{n+1})}(x)\le 0,\ \forall x\ge 1, \end{align} where \alpha_n=an and \beta_n=bn for some a,b\ge 0. The above inequality has a similar taste as the Tu\'ran type inequalities, but with \alpha_n and \beta_n that depends linearly on n.
