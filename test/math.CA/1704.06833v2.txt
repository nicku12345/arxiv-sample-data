We prove a limited range, off-diagonal extrapolation theorem that generalizes a number of results in the theory of Rubio de Francia extrapolation, and use this to prove a limited range, multilinear extrapolation theorem. We give two applications of this result to the bilinear Hilbert transform. First, we give sufficient conditions on a pair of weights w_1,\,w_2 for the bilinear Hilbert transform to satisfy weighted norm inequalities of the form \[ BH : L^{p_1}(w_1^{p_1}) \times L^{p_2}(w_2^{p_2}) \longrightarrow L^p(w^p), \] where w=w_1w_2 and \frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}<\frac{3}{2}. This improves the recent results of Culiuc et al. by increasing the families of weights for which this inequality holds and by pushing the lower bound on p from 1 down to \frac{2}{3}, the critical index from the unweighted theory of the bilinear Hilbert transform. Second, as an easy consequence of our method we obtain that the bilinear Hilbert transform satisfies some vector-valued inequalities with Muckenhoupt weights. This reproves and generalizes some of the vector-valued estimates obtained by Benea and Muscalu in the unweighted case. We also generalize recent results of Carando, et al. on Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund estimates for multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators.
