We present a multiplier theorem on anisotropic Hardy spaces. When m satisfies the anisotropic, pointwise Mihlin condition, we obtain boundedness of the multiplier operator T_m : H_A^p (\mathbb{R}^n) \rightarrow H_A^p (\mathbb{R}^n), for the range of p that depends on the eccentricities of the dilation A and the level of regularity of a multiplier symbol m. This extends the classical multiplier theorem of Taibleson and Weiss.
