We open a new field on how one can define means on infinite sets. We investigate many different ways on how such means can be constructed. One method is based on sequences of ideals, other deals with accumulation points, one uses isolated points, other deals with average using integral, other with limit of average on surroundings and one deals with evenly distributed samples. We study various properties of such means and their relations to each other.
