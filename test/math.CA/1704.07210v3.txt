We prove that any Besicovitch set in \mathbb{R}^3 must have Hausdorff dimension at least 5/2+\epsilon_0 for some small constant \epsilon_0>0. This follows from a more general result about the volume of unions of tubes that satisfy the Wolff axioms. Our proof grapples with a new "almost counter example" to the Kakeya conjecture, which we call the SL_2 example; this object resembles a Besicovitch set that has Minkowski dimension 3 but Hausdorff dimension 5/2. We believe this example may be an interesting object for future study.
