For \alpha>\beta-1>0, we obtain two sided inequalities for the moment integral I(\alpha,\beta)= \int_{\mathbb{R}} |x|^{-\beta}|\sin x|^{\alpha}dx. These are then used to give the exact asymptotic behavior of the integral as \alpha \to \infty. The case I(\alpha,\alpha) corresponds to the asymptotics of Ball's inequality, and I(\alpha,[\alpha]-1) corresponds to a kind of novel "oscillatory" behavior.
