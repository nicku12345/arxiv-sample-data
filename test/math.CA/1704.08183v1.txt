The aim of this paper is to introduce a Dunkl generalization of the operators including two variable Hermite polynomials which are defined by Krech [14](Krech, G. A note on some positive linear operators associated with the Hermite polynomials, Carpathian J. Math., 32 (1) (2016), 71--77) and to investigate approximating properties for these operators by means of the classical modulus of continuity, second modulus of continuity and Peetre's K-functional.
