The classical beta function B(x; y) is one of the most fundamental special functions, due to its important role in various fields in the mathematical, physical, engineering and statistical sciences. Useful extensions of the classical Beta function has been considered by many authors. In the present paper, our main objective is to study the convergence of extensions of classical beta function and introduce modified extension of classical beta function. It is interpreted numerically and geometrically in the view of convergence, further properties and integral presentations are established.
