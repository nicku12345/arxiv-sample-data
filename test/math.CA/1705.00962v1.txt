A new derivative, called deformable derivative, is introduced here which is equivalent to ordinary derivative in the sense that one implies other. The deformable derivative is defined using limit approach like that of ordinary one but with respect to a parameter varying over unit interval. Thus it could also be regarded as a fractional derivative. Reason of calling it as deformable derivative is because of its intrinsic property of continuously deforming function to derivative. This is substantiated by its linear connection to function and its derivative. Besides discussing some of its basic properties, we discover the forms of Rolle's, Mean Value and Taylor's theorems. The fundamental theorem of calculus for this fractional derivative could be taken as definition of its fractional integral. As a theoretical application some fractional differential equations are solved.
