We study four problems in the dynamics of a body moving about a fixed point, providing a non-complex, analytical solution for all of them. For the first two, we will work on the motion first integrals. For the symmetrical heavy body, that is the Lagrange-Poisson case, we compute the second and third Euler angles in explicit and real forms by means of multiple hypergeometric functions (Lauricella, functions). Releasing the weight load but adding the complication of the asymmetry, by means of elliptic integrals of third kind, we provide the precession angle completing some previous treatments of the Euler-Poinsot case. Integrating then the relevant differential equation, we reach the finite polar equation of a special trajectory named the {\it herpolhode}. In the last problem we keep the symmetry of the first problem, but without the weight, and take into account a viscous dissipation. The approach of first integrals is no longer practicable in this situation and the Euler equations are faced directly leading to dumped goniometric functions obtained as particular occurrences of Bessel functions of order -1/2.
