Uniform asymptotic expansions involving exponential and Airy functions are obtained for Laguerre polynomials L_{n}^{(\alpha)}(x), as well as complementary confluent hypergeometric functions. The expansions are valid for n large and \alpha small or large, uniformly for unbounded real and complex values of x. The new expansions extend the range of computability of L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) compared to previous expansions, in particular with respect to higher terms and large values of \alpha. Numerical evidence of their accuracy for real and complex values of x is provided.
