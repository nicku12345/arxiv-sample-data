This paper deals with the initial value problem for the multi-term fractional differential equation. The fractional derivative is defined in the Caputo sense. Firstly the initial value problem is transformed into a equivalent Volterra-type integral equation under appropriate assumptions. Then new existence results for smooth solutions are established by using the Schauder fixed point theorem.
