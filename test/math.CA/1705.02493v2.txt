In our previous work we found sufficient conditions to be imposed on the parameters of the generalized hypergeometric function in order that it be completely monotonic or of Stieltjes class. In this paper we collect a number of consequences of these properties. In particular, we find new integral representations of the generalized hypergeometric functions, evaluate a number of integrals of their products, compute the jump and the average value of the the generalized hypergeometric function over the branch cut, establish new inequalities for this function in the half plane Re(z)<1. Furthermore, we discuss integral representations of absolutely monotonic functions and present a curious formula for a finite sum of products of gamma ratios as an integral of Meijer's G function.
