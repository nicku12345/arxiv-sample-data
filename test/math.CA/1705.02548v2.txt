In the present paper, we characterize the nonnegative functions \varphi for which the multi-parameter Hausdorff operator \mathcal H_\varphi generated by \varphi is bounded on the multi-parameter Hardy space H^1(\mathbb R\times\cdots\times\mathbb R) or L^p(\mathbb R^n), p\in [1,\infty]. The corresponding operator norms are also obtained. Our results improve some recent results in \cite{FZ, LM2, LM3, We} and give an answer to an open question posted by Liflyand \cite{Li}.
