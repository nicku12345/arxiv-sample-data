The solution of some fractional differential equations is the hottest topic in fractional calculus field. The fractional distributed order reaction-diffusion equation is the aim of this paper. By applying integral transform to solve this type of fractional differential equations, we have obtained the analytical solution by using Laplace-Sumudu transform.
