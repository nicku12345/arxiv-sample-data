Hypergeometric functions and their generalizations play an important r\^{o}les in diverse applications. Many authors have been established generalizations of hypergeometric functions by a number ways. In this paper, we aim at establishing (presumably new) extended k-type hypergeometric function _{2}f_{1}^{k}[a, b; c; \omega; z] and study various properties including integral representations, differential formulas and fractional integral and derivative formula.
