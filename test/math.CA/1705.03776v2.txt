In this article, a new approach based on linear algebra is adopted to study a hybrid Sheffer polynomial sequences. The recurrence relations and differential equation for these polynomials are derived by using the properties and relationships between the Pascal functional matrices and the Wronskian matrices. The corresponding results for some mixed type Sheffer polynomials are also obtained.
