In this paper we study the following multi-parameter variant of the celebrated Falconer distance problem. Given {\textbf{d}}=(d_1,d_2, \dots, d_{\ell})\in \mathbb{N}^{\ell} with d_1+d_2+\dots+d_{\ell}=d and E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d, we define  \Delta_{{\textbf{d}}}(E) = \left\{ \left(|x^{(1)}-y^{(1)}|,\ldots,|x^{(\ell)}-y^{(\ell)}|\right) : x,y \in E \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{\ell},  where for x\in \mathbb{R}^d we write x=\left( x^{(1)},\dots, x^{(\ell)} \right) with x^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}.   We ask how large does the Hausdorff dimension of E need to be to ensure that the \ell-dimensional Lebesgue measure of \Delta_{{\textbf{d}}}(E) is positive? We prove that if 2 \leq d_i for 1 \leq i \leq \ell, then the conclusion holds provided  \dim(E)>d-\frac{\min d_i}{2}+\frac{1}{3}. We also note that, by previous constructions, the conclusion does not in general hold if \dim(E)<d-\frac{\min d_i}{2}. A group action derivation of a suitable Mattila integral plays an important role in the argument.
