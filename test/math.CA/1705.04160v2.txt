In the present paper, we study the number of zeros of the first order Melnikov function for piecewise smooth polynomial differential system, to estimate the number of limit cycles bifurcated from the period annulus of quadratic isochronous centers, when they are perturbed inside the class of all piecewise smooth polynomial differential systems of degree n with the straight line of discontinuity x=0. An explicit and fairly accurate upper bound for the number of zeros of the first order Melnikov functions with respect to quadratic isochronous centers S_1, S_2 and S_3 is provided. For quadratic isochronous center S_4, we give a rough estimate for the number of zeros of the first order Melnikov function due to its complexity. Furthermore, we improve the upper bound associated with S_4, from 14n+11 in \cite{LLLZ}, 12n-1 in \cite{SZ} to [(5n-5)/2], when it is perturbed inside all smooth polynomial differential systems of degree n. Besides, some evidence on the equivalence of the first order Melnikov function and the first order Averaged function for piecewise smooth polynomial differential systems is found.
