In this article we prove some identities which allow us to evaluate some multiple unit square integrals. In our examples we will give the value of some double and triple integrals. Then, we prove several classical integral formulas with the help of these identities and we present others that seems to be new. Finally we get double integrals for classical constants and different expression for two Ramanujan's integral formulas.
