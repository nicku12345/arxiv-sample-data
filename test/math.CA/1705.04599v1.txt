We develop a new and further generalized form of the fractional kinetic equation involving generalized k-Bessel function. The manifold generality of the generalized k-Bessel function is discussed in terms of the solution of the fractional kinetic equation in the present paper. The results obtained here are quite general in nature and capable of yielding a very large number of known and (presumably) new results.
