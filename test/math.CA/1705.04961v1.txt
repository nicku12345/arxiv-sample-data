A result of P. Tukia from 1989 says that Lebesgue measure on \mathbb{R} has conformal dimension zero: for every \epsilon > 0, there is a Borel set G \subset \mathbb{R} of full Lebesgue measure, and a quasisymmetric homeomorphism f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} such that \dim_{\mathrm{H}} f(G) < \epsilon. In this short note, I show that the same is true for every locally finite Borel measure on \mathbb{R}.
