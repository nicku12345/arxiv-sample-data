The present article is devoted to functions from a certain subclass of non-differentiable functions. The arguments and values of considered functions represented by the s-adic representation or the nega-s-adic representation of real numbers. The technique of modeling such functions is the simplest as compared with well-known techniques of modeling non-differentiable functions. In other words, values of these functions are obtained from the s-adic or nega-s-adic representation of the argument by a certain change of digits or combinations of digits.
