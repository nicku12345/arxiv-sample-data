We prove that if M and N are Riemannian, oriented n-dimensional manifolds without boundary and additionally N is compact, then Sobolev mappings W^{1,n}(M,N) of finite distortion are continuous. In particular, W^{1,n}(M,N) mappings with almost everywhere positive Jacobian are continuous. This result has been known since 1976 in the case of mappings W^{1,n}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n), where \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n is an open set. The case of mappings between manifolds is much more difficult.
