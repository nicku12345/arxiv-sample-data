In 1987 Harris proved (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 101) - among others- that for each 1\le p<2 there exists a two-dimensional function f\in L^p such that its triangular Walsh-Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. In this paper we investigate the Fej\'er (or (C,1)) means of the triangle two variable Walsh-Fourier series of L^1 functions. Namely, we prove the a.e. convergence \sigma_n^{\bigtriangleup}f = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}S_{k, n-k}f\to f (n\to\infty) for each integrable two-variable function f.
