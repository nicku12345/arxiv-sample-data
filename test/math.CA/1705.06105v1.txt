For a matrix A_2 weight W on R^p, we introduce a new notion of W-Calder\'on-Zygmund matrix kernels, following earlier work in by Isralowitz. We state and prove a T1 theorem for such operators and give a representation theorem in terms of dyadic W-Haar shifts and paraproducts, in the spirit of Hyt\"onen's Representation Theorem. Finally, by means of a Bellman function argument, we give sharp bounds for such operators in terms of bounds for weighted matrix martingale transforms and paraproducts.
