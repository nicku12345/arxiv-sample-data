In this paper, we deal with the Orthogonal Procrustes Problem, in which two point configurations are compared in order to construct a map to optimally align the two sets. This extends this to \varepsilon-diffeomorphisms, introduced by [1] Damelin and Fefferman. Examples will be given for when complete maps can not be constructed, for if the distributions do match, and finally an algorithm for partitioning the configurations into polygons for convenient construction of the maps.
