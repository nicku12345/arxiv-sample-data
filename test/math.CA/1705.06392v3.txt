In this paper, we solve a spectral problem about positive semi-definite trace-class pseudodifferential operators on modulation spaces which was posed by H. Feichtinger. Later, C. Heil and D. Larson rephrased the problem in the broader setting of positive semi-definite trace-class operators on a separable Hilbert space. Our solution consists in constructing a counterexample that solves Hans Feichtinger's problem by first solving this second problem.
