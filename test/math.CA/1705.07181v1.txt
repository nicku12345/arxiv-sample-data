We introduce a new derivative, the so-called truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional derivative for \alpha-differentiable functions through the six parameters truncated Mittag-Leffler function, which generalizes different fractional derivatives, recently introduced: conformable fractional derivatives, alternative fractional derivative, truncated alternative fractional derivative, M-fractional derivative and truncated M-fractional derivative.   This new truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional derivative satisfies properties of the entire order calculus, among them: linearity, product rule, quotient rule, function composition, and chain rule. Also, as in the case of the Caputo derivative, the derivative of a constant is zero. Since the six parameters Mittag-Leffler function is a generalization of Mittag-Leffler functions of one, two, three, four, and five parameters, we can extend some of the classic results of the entire order calculus, namely: Rolle's theorem, the mean value theorem and its extension. In addition, we present the theorem involving the law of exponents for derivatives and we calculated the truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional derivative of the two parameters Mittag-Leffler function.   Finally, we present the \mathcal{V}-fractional integral from which, as a natural consequence, new results appear as applications. Specifically, we generalize inverse property, the fundamental theorem of calculus, a theorem associated with classical integration by parts, and the mean value theorem for integrals. Also, we calculate the \mathcal{V}-fractional integral of the two parameters Mittag-Leffler function. Further, through the truncated \mathcal{V}-fractional derivative and the \mathcal{V}-fractional integral, we obtain a relation with the fractional derivative and integral in the Riemann-Liouville sense, in the case 0<\alpha<1.
