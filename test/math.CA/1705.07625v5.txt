This paper first discusses irreducibility of a Painlev\'e equation P. We explain how the Painlev\'e property is helpful for the computation of special classical and algebraic solutions. As in a paper of Morales-Ruiz we associate an autonomous Hamiltonian \mathbb{H} to a Painlev\'e equation P. Complete integrability of \mathbb{H} is shown to imply that all solutions to P are classical (which includes algebraic), so in particular P is solvable by ''quadratures''. Next, we show that the variational equation of P at a given algebraic solution coincides with the normal variational equation of \mathbb{H} at the corresponding solution. Finally, we test the Morales-Ramis theorem in all cases P_{2} to P_{5} where algebraic solutions are present, by showing how our results lead to a quick computation of the component of the identity of the differential Galois group for the first two variational equations. As expected there are no cases where this group is commutative.
