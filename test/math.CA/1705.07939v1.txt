The _{3}F_{2} hypergeometric function plays a very significant role in the theory of hypergeometric and generalized hypergeometric series. Despite that _{3}F_{2} hypergeometric function has several applications in mathematics, also it has a lot of applications in physics and statistics.   The fundamental purpose of this research paper is to find out the explicit expression of the _{3}F_{2} Watson's classical summation theorem of the form: \[ _{3}F_{2}\left[ \begin{array} [c]{ccccc}% a, & b, & c & & \\ & & & ; & 1\\ \frac{1}{2}(a+b+i+1), & 2c+j & & & \end{array} \right] \] with arbitrary i and j, where for i=j=0, we get the well known Watson's theorem for the series _{3}F_{2}(1).
