In this paper we are concerned with the periodic Hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom, where the origin is a trivial solution. We assume that the corresponding linearized system at the origin is elliptic, and the characteristic exponents of the linearized system are \pm i\omega with \omega be a Diophantine number, moreover if the system is formally linearizable, then it is analytically linearizable. As a result, the origin is always stable in the sense of Liapunov in this case.
