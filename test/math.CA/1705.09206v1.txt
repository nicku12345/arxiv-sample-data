In this paper we present a theorem that generalizes Sawyer's classic result about mixed weighted inequalities to the multilinear context. Let \vec{w}=(w_1,...,w_m) and \nu = w_1^\frac{1}{m}...w_m^\frac{1}{m}, the main result of the paper sentences that under different conditions on the weights we can obtain \Bigg\| \frac{T(\vec f\,)(x)}{v}\Bigg\|_{L^{\frac{1}{m}, \infty}(\nu v^\frac{1}{m})} \leq C \ \prod_{i=1}^m{\|f_i\|_{L^1(w_i)}},  where T is a multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operator. To obtain this result we first prove it for the m-fold product of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M, and also for \mathcal{M}(\vec{f})(x): the multi(sub)linear maximal function introduced in \cite{LOPTT}.   As an application we also prove a vector-valued extension to the mixed weighted weak-type inequalities of multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators.
