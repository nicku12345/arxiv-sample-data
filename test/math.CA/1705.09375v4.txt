The Bochner-Riesz multipliers  B_{\delta } on  \mathbb R ^{n} are shown to satisfy a range of sparse bounds, for all 0< \delta < \frac {n-1}2 . The range of sparse bounds increases to the optimal range, as  \delta  increases to the critical value,  \delta =\frac {n-1}2, even assuming only partial information on the Bochner-Riesz conjecture in dimensions  n \geq 3. In dimension n=2, we prove a sharp range of sparse bounds. The method of proof is based upon a `single scale' analysis, and yields the sharpest known weighted estimates for the Bochner-Riesz multipliers in the category of Muckenhoupt weights.
