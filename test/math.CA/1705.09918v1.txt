A crucial role in the Nyman-Beurling-B\'aez-Duarte approach to the Riemann Hypothesis is played by the distance \[ d_N^2:=\inf_{A_N}\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\left|1-\zeta A_N\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^2\frac{dt}{\frac{1}{4}+t^2}\:, \] where the infimum is over all Dirichlet polynomials A_N(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{a_n}{n^s} of length N. In this paper we investigate d_N^2 under the assumption that the Riemann zeta function has four non-trivial zeros off the critical line. Thus we obtain a criterion for the non validity of the Riemann Hypothesis.
