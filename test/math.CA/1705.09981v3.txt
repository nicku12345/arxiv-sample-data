An A_1-A_\infty estimate improving a previous result in arXiv:1607.06432 is obtained. Also new a result in terms of the {A_\infty} constant and the one supremum A_q-A_\infty^{\exp} constant, is proved, providing a counterpart for the result obained in arXiv:1705.08364. Both of the preceding results rely upon a sparse domination in terms of bilinear forms for [b,T_\Omega] with \Omega\in L^\infty(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}) and b\in BMO which is established relying upon techniques from arXiv:1705.07397.
