In this paper we analyze biased Maker-Breaker games and Avoider-Enforcer games, both played on the edge set of a random board G\sim \gnp. In Maker-Breaker games there are two players, denoted by Maker and Breaker. In each round, Maker claims one previously unclaimed edge of G and Breaker responds by claiming b previously unclaimed edges. We consider the Hamiltonicity game, the perfect matching game and the k-vertex-connectivity game, where Maker's goal is to build a graph which possesses the relevant property. Avoider-Enforcer games are the reverse analogue of Maker-Breaker games with a slight modification, where the two players claim at least 1 and at least b previously unclaimed edges per move, respectively, and Avoider aims to avoid building a graph which possesses the relevant property.   Maker-Breaker games are known to be "bias-monotone", that is, if Maker wins the (1,b) game, he also wins the (1,b-1) game. Therefore, it makes sense to define the critical bias of a game, b^*, to be the "breaking point" of the game. That is, Maker wins the (1,b) game whenever b\leq b^* and loses otherwise. An analogous definition of the critical bias exists for Avoider-Enforcer games: here, the critical bias of a game b^* is such that Avoider wins the (1,b) game for every b > b^*, and loses otherwise.   We prove that, for every p=\omega(\frac{\ln n}{n}), G\sim\gnp is typically such that the critical bias for all the aforementioned Maker-Breaker games is asymptotically b^*=\frac{np}{\ln n}. We also prove that in the case p=\Theta(\frac{\ln n}{n}), the critical bias is b^*=\Theta(\frac{np}{\ln n}). These results settle a conjecture of Stojakovi\'c and Szab\'o. For Avoider-Enforcer games, we prove that for p=\Omega(\frac{\ln n}{n}), the critical bias for all the aforementioned games is b^*=\Theta(\frac{np}{\ln n}).
