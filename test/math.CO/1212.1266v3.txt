The derangement polynomial for the symmetric group enumerates derangements by the number of excedances. It can be interpreted as the local h-polynomial, in the sense of Stanley, of the barycentric subdivision of the simplex. Motivated by this interpretation, we define a derangement polynomial for the even-signed permutation group. The coefficients of this polynomial are nonnegative, symmetric and unimodal. We show that they enumerate derangements in the even-signed permutation group according to a notion of excedance, which is analogous to the one introduced by Brenti for signed permutations. We also give an explicit formula for the corresponding exponential generating function.
