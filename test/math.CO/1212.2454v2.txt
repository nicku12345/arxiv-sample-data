Tur\'{a}n's theorem is a cornerstone of extremal graph theory. It asserts that for any integer r \geq 2 every graph on n vertices with more than {\tfrac{r-2}{2(r-1)}\cdot n^2} edges contains a clique of size r, i.e., r mutually adjacent vertices. The corresponding extremal graphs are balanced (r-1)-partite graphs.   The question as to how many such r-cliques appear at least in any n-vertex graph with \gamma n^2 edges has been intensively studied in the literature. In particular, Lov\'{a}sz and Simonovits conjectured in the 1970s that asymptotically the best possible lower bound is given by the complete multipartite graph with \gamma n^2 edges in which all but one vertex class is of the same size while the remaining one may be smaller.   Their conjecture was recently resolved for r=3 by Razborov and for r=4 by Nikiforov. In this article, we prove the conjecture for all values of r.
