A zero-sum sequence of integers is a sequence of nonzero terms that sum to 0. Let k>0 be an integer and let [-k,k] denote the set of all nonzero integers between -k and k. Let \ell(k) be the smallest integer \ell such that any zero-sum sequence with elements from [-k,k] and length greater than \ell contains a proper nonempty zero-sum subsequence. In this paper, we prove a more general result which implies that \ell(k)=2k-1 for k>1.
