An alternating permutation of length n is a permutation \pi=\pi_1 \pi_2 ... \pi_n such that \pi_1 < \pi_2 > \pi_3 < \pi_4 > .... Let A_n denote set of alternating permutations of {1,2,..., n}, and let A_n(\sigma) be set of alternating permutations in A_n that avoid a pattern \sigma. Recently, Lewis used generating trees to enumerate A_{2n}(1234), A_{2n}(2143) and A_{2n+1}(2143), and he posed several conjectures on the Wilf-equivalence of alternating permutations avoiding certain patterns. Some of these conjectures have been proved by B\'ona, Xu and Yan. In this paper, we prove the two relations |A_{2n+1}(1243)|=|A_{2n+1}(2143)| and |A_{2n}(4312)|=|A_{2n}(1234)| as conjectured by Lewis.
