We discuss properties of root posets for finite crystallographic root systems, and show that these properties uniquely determine root posets for the noncrystallographic dihedral types and type H_3, while proving that there does not exist a poset satisfying all of the properties in type H_4. We do this by exhaustive computer searches for posets having these properties. We further give a realization of the poset of type H_3 as restricted roots of type D_6, and conjecture a Hilbert polynomial for the q,t-Catalan numbers for type H_4.
