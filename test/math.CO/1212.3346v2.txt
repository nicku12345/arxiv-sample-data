Infinite antichains of permutations have long been used to construct interesting permutation classes and counterexamples. We prove the existence and detail the construction of infinite antichains with arbitrarily large growth rates. As a consequence, we show that every proper permutation class is contained in a class with a rational generating function. While this result implies the conclusion of the Marcus-Tardos theorem, that theorem is used in our proof.
