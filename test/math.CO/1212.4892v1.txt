This paper considers a kind of generalized measure \lambda_s^{(h)} of fault tolerance in a hypercube-like graph G_n which contain several well-known interconnection networks such as hypercubes, varietal hypercubes, twisted cubes, crossed cubes and M\"obius cubes, and proves \lambda_s^{(h)}(G_n)= 2^h(n-h) for any h with 0\leqslant h\leqslant n-1 by the induction on n and a new technique. This result shows that at least 2^h(n-h) edges of G_n have to be removed to get a disconnected graph that contains no vertices of degree less than h. Compared with previous results, this result enhances fault-tolerant ability of the above-mentioned networks theoretically.
