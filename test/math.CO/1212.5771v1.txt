Regular A_n-crystals are certain edge-colored directed graphs which are related to representations of the quantized universal enveloping algebra U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}). For such a crystal K with colors 1,2,...,n, we consider its maximal connected subcrystals with colors 1,...,n-1 and with colors 2,...,n and characterize the interlacing structure for all pairs of these subcrystals. This is used to give a recursive description of the combinatorial structure of K and develop an efficient procedure of assembling K.
