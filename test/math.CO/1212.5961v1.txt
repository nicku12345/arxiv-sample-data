The Bollobas-Riordan polynomial [Math. Ann. 323, 81 (2002)] extends the Tutte polynomial and its contraction/deletion rule for ordinary graphs to ribbon graphs. Given a ribbon graph \cG, the related polynomial should be computable from the knowledge of the terminal forms of \cG namely specific induced graphs for which the contraction/deletion procedure becomes more involved. We consider some classes of terminal forms as rosette ribbon graphs with N\ge 1 petals and solve their associate Bollobas-Riordan polynomial. This work therefore enlarges the list of terminal forms for ribbon graphs for which the Bollobas-Riordan polynomial could be directly deduced.
