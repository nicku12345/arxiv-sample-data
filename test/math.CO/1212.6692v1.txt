Let G be a graph, S be a set of vertices of G, and \lambda(S) be the maximum number \ell of pairwise edge-disjoint trees T_1, T_2,..., T_{\ell} in G such that S\subseteq V(T_i) for every 1\leq i\leq \ell. The generalized k-edge-connectivity \lambda_k(G) of G is defined as \lambda_k(G)= min\{\lambda(S) | S\subseteq V(G) \ and \ |S|=k\}. Thus \lambda_2(G)=\lambda(G). In this paper, we consider the Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for the parameter \lambda_k(G). We determine sharp upper and lower bounds of \lambda_k(G)+\lambda_k(\bar{G}) and \lambda_k(G)... \lambda_k(\bar{G}) for a graph G of order n, as well as for a graph of order n and size m. Some graph classes attaining these bounds are also given.
