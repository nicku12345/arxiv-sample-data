Let K_n^c be an edge-coloured complete graph on n vertices. Let \Delta_{\rm mon}(K_n^c) denote the largest number of edges of the same colour incident with a vertex of K_n^c. A properly coloured cycle is a cycle such that no two adjacent edges have the same colour. In 1976, Bollob\'as and Erd\H{o}s conjectured that every K_n^c with \Delta_{\rm mon}(K_n^c) < \lfloor n/2 \rfloor contains a properly coloured Hamiltonian cycle. In this paper, we show that for any \varepsilon > 0 , there exists an integer n_0 such that every K_n^c with \Delta_{\rm mon}(K_n^c) < (1/2 - \varepsilon) n  and n \ge n_0 contains a properly coloured Hamiltonian cycle. This improves a result of Alon and Gutin. Hence, the conjecture of Bollob\'as and Erd\H{o}s is true asymptotically.
