The (k,\ell)-rainbow index rx_{k, \ell}(G) of a graph G was introduced by Chartrand et. al. For the complete graph K_n of order n\geq 6, they showed that rx_{3,\ell}(K_n)=3 for \ell=1,2. Furthermore, they conjectured that for every positive integer \ell, there exists a positive integer N such that rx_{3,\ell}(K_{n})=3 for every integer n \geq N. More generally, they conjectured that for every pair of positive integers k and \ell with k\geq 3, there exists a positive integer N such that rx_{k,\ell}(K_{n})=k for every integer n \geq N. This paper is to give solutions to these conjectures.
