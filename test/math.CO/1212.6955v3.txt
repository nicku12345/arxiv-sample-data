We call (a_1, \dots, a_n) an \emph{r-partial sequence} if exactly r of its entries are positive integers and the rest are all zero. For {\bf c} = (c_1, \dots, c_n) with 1 \leq c_1 \leq \dots \leq c_n, let S_{\bf c}^{(r)} be the set of r-partial sequences (a_1, \dots, a_n) with 0 \leq a_i \leq c_i for each i in \{1, \dots, n\}, and let S_{\bf c}^{(r)}(1) be the set of members of S_{\bf c}^{(r)} which have a_1 = 1. We say that (a_1, \dots, a_n) \emph{meets} (b_1, \dots, b_m) if a_i = b_i \neq 0 for some i. Two sets A and B of sequences are said to be \emph{cross-intersecting} if each sequence in A meets each sequence in B. Let {\bf d} = (d_1, \dots, d_m) with 1 \leq d_1 \leq \dots \leq d_m. Let A \subseteq S_{\bf c}^{(r)} and B \subseteq S_{\bf d}^{(s)} such that A and B are cross-intersecting. We show that |A||B| \leq |S_{\bf c}^{(r)}(1)||S_{\bf d}^{(s)}(1)| if either c_1 \geq 3 and d_1 \geq 3 or {\bf c} = {\bf d} and r = s = n. We also determine the cases of equality. We obtain this by proving a general cross-intersection theorem for \emph{weighted} sets. The bound generalises to one for k \geq 2 cross-intersecting sets.
