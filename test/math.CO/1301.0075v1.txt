For a graph G, let S(G) be the Seidel matrix of G and \te_1(G),...,\te_n(G) be the eigenvalues of S(G). The Seidel energy of G is defined as |\te_1(G)|+...+|\te_n(G)|. Willem Haemers conjectured that the Seidel energy of any graph with n vertices is at least 2n-2, the Seidel energy of the complete graph with n vertices. Motivated by this conjecture, we prove that for any \al with 0<\al<2, |\te_1(G)|^\al+...+|\te_n(G)|^\al\g (n-1)^\al+n-1 if and only if |{\rm det} S(G)|\g n-1. This, in particular, implies the Haemers' conjecture for all graphs G with |{\rm det} S(G)|\g n-1.
