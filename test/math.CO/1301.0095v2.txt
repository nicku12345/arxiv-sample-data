Let G be an additive abelian group and let A,B \subseteq G be finite and nonempty. The pair (A,B) is called critical if the sumset A+B = {a+b \mid a \in A and b\in B} satisfies |A+B| < |A| + |B|. Vosper proved a theorem which characterizes all critical pairs in the special case when |G| is prime. Kemperman generalized this by proving a structure theorem for critical pairs in an arbitrary abelian group. Here we give a new proof of Kemperman's Theorem.
