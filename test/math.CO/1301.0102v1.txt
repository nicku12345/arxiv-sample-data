A graph is called Ricci-flat if its Ricci-curvatures vanish on all edges. Here we use the definition of Ricci-cruvature on graphs given in [Lin-Lu-Yau, Tohoku Math., 2011], which is a variation of [Ollivier, J. Funct. Math., 2009]. In this paper, we classified all Ricci-flat connected graphs with girth at least five: they are the infinite path, cycle C_n (n\geq 6), the dodecahedral graph, the Petersen graph, and the half-dodecahedral graph. We also construct many Ricci-flat graphs with girth 3 or 4 by using the root systems of simple Lie algebras.
