We introduce and study a variant of the family of Johnson graphs, the Full-Flag Johnson graphs. We show that Full-Flag Johnson graphs are Cayley graphs on S_n generated by certain classes of permutations, and that they are in fact generalizations of permutahedra. We derive some results about the adjacency matrices of Full-Flag Johnson graphs and apply these to the set of permutahedra to deduce part of their spectra.
