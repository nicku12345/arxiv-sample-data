Given a graph G, a subset M of V(G) is a module of G if for each v\in V(G)\setminus M, v is adjacent to all the elements of M or to none of them. For instance, V(G), \emptyset and \{v\} (v\in V(G)) are modules of G called trivial. Given a graph G, \omega_M(G) (respectively \alpha_M(G)) denotes the largest integer m such that there is a module M of G which is a clique (respectively a stable) set in G with |M|=m. A graph G is prime if |V(G)|\geq 4 and if all its modules are trivial. The prime bound of G is the smallest integer p(G) such that there is a prime graph H with V(H)\supseteq V(G), H[V(G)]=G and |V(H)\setminus V(G)|=p(G). We establish the following. For every graph G such that \max(\alpha_M(G),\omega_M(G))\geq 2 and \log_2(\max(\alpha_M(G),\omega_M(G))) is not an integer, p(G)=\lceil\log_2(\max(\alpha_M(G),\omega_M(G)))\rceil. Then, we prove that for every graph G such that \max(\alpha_M(G),\omega_M(G))=2^k where k\geq 1, p(G)=k or k+1. Moreover p(G)=k+1 if and only if G or its complement admits 2^k isolated vertices. Lastly, we show that p(G)=1 for every non prime graph G such that |V(G)|\geq 4 and \alpha_M(G)=\omega_M(G)=1.
