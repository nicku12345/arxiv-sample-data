A proper merging of two disjoint quasi-ordered sets P and Q is a quasi-order on the union of P and Q such that the restriction to P or Q yields the original quasi-order again and such that no elements of P and Q are identified. In this article, we determine the number of proper mergings in the case where P is a star (i.e. an antichain with a smallest element adjoined), and Q is a chain. We show that the lattice of proper mergings of an m-antichain and an n-chain, previously investigated by the author, is a quotient lattice of the lattice of proper mergings of an m-star and an n-chain, and we determine the number of proper mergings of an m-star and an n-chain by counting the number of congruence classes and by determining their cardinalities. Additionally, we compute the number of Galois connections between certain modified Boolean lattices and chains.
