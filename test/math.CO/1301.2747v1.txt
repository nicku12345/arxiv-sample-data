In 1980, Ajtai, Komlos and Szemer{\'e}di defined "groupie": Let G=(V,E) be a simple graph, |V|=n, |E|=e. For a vertex v\in V, let r(v) denote the sum of the degrees of the vertices adjacent to v. We say v\in V is a {\it groupie}, if \frac{r(v)}{\deg(v)}\geq\frac{e}{n}. In this paper, we prove that in random graph B(n,p), 0<p<1, the proportion of groupies converges in probability towards \Phi(1)\approx0.8413 as n approaches infinity, where \Phi(x) is the distribution function of standard normal distribution N(0,1). We also discuss the asymptotic behavior of the proportion of groupies in complete bipartite graph B(n_1,n_2,p).
