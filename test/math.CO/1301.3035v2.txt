We obtain explicit formulas for the enumeration of labelled parallelogram polyominoes. These are the polyominoes that are bounded, above and below, by north-east lattice paths going from the origin to a point (k,n). The numbers from 1 and n (the labels) are bijectively attached to the n north steps of the above-bounding path, with the condition that they appear in increasing values along consecutive north steps. We calculate the Frobenius characteristic of the action of the symmetric group S_n on these labels. All these enumeration results are refined to take into account the area of these polyominoes. We make a connection between our enumeration results and the theory of operators for which the intergral Macdonald polynomials are joint eigenfunctions. We also explain how these same polyominoes can be used to explicitly construct a linear basis of a ring of SL_2-invariants.
