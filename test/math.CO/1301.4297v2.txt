In this paper we provide two results. The first one consists an infinitary version of the Furstenberg-Weiss Theorem. More precisely we show that every subset A of a homogeneous tree T such that \frac{|A\cap T(n)|}{|T(n)|}\geq\delta, where T(n) denotes the n-th level of T, for all n in a van der Waerden set, for some positive real \delta, contains a strong subtree having a level sets which forms a van der Waerden set.   The second result is the following. For every sequence (m_q)_{q} of positive integers and for every real 0<\delta\\leq1, there exists a sequence (n_q)_{q} of positive integers such that for every D\subseteq \bigcup_k\prod_{q=0}^{k-1}[n_q] satisfying \frac{\big{|}D\cap \prod_{q=0}^{k-1} [n_q]\big{|}}{\prod_{q=0}^{k-1}n_q}\geq\delta for every k in a van der Waerden set, there is a sequence (J_q)_{q}, where J_q is an arithmetic progression of length m_q contained in [n_q] for all q, such that \prod_{q=0}^{k-1}J_q\subseteq D for every k in a van der Waerden set. Moreover, working in an abstract setting, we obtain J_q to be any configuration of natural numbers that can be found in an arbitrary set of positive density.
