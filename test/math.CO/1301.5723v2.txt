We introduce a partial order on the set of all reduced words of a given permutation \omega, called \emph{directed-braid poset} of \omega. This poset enables us to produce two algorithms: One is a sorting algorithm applied on any reduced word of \omega and aims to obtained the natural word (lexicographically largest reduced word); the other one is a generation algorithm applied on the natural word and aims to obtained the set of all reduced words of \omega.
