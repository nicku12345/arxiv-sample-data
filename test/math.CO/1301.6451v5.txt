Symmetries of geometric structures such as hyperplane arrangements, point configurations and polytopes have been studied extensively for a long time. However, symmetries of oriented matroids, a common combinatorial abstraction of them, are not understood well. In this paper, we aim to obtain a better understanding of symmetries of oriented matroids. First, we put focus on symmetries of matroids, and give a general construction that generates a 3-dimensional point configuration with a matroidal symmetry that cannot be realized as a geometric symmetry. The construction is based on the observation that every non-trivial rotation in the 2-dimensional Euclidean space has a unique fixed point but that there is no corresponding property for matroids. The construction suggests that the lack of the fixed point theorem generates a big gap between matroidal symmetries and geometric symmetries of point configurations. Motivated by this insight, we study fixed-point properties for symmetry groups of oriented matroids. For rotational symmetries of oriented matroids, we prove a useful property, which corresponds to the uniqueness of fixed points (in the rank 3 case). Using it, we classify rotational and full symmetry groups of simple oriented matroids of rank 3. In addition, we define fixed-point-admitting (FPA) property for subgroups of symmetry groups of oriented matroids, and make classification of rotational symmetry groups with FPA property of simple acyclic oriented matroids of rank 4. We conjecture that the symmetry group of every acyclic simple oriented matroid has FPA property.
