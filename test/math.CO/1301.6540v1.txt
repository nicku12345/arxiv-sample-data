We study the asymptotic distribution of the two following combinatorial parameters: the number of arc crossings in the linear representation, {\mathrm cr^{(\ell)}, and the number of chord crossings in the circular representation, {\mathrm cr^{(c)}, of a random set partition. We prove that, for k\leq n/(2\,\log n) (resp., {k=o(\sqrt{n})}), the distribution of the parameter {\mathrm cr^{(\ell)} (resp., {\mathrm cr^{(c)}) taken over partitions of [n]:=\{1,2,...,n\} into k blocks is, after standardization, asymptotically Gaussian as n tends to infinity. We give exact and asymptotic formulas for the variance of the distribution of the parameter {\mathrm cr^{(\ell)} from which we deduce that the distribution of {\mathrm cr^{(\ell)} and {\mathrm cr^{(c)} taken over all partitions of [n] is concentrated around its mean. The proof of these results relies on a standard analysis of generating functions associated with the parameter {\mathrm cr^{(\ell)} obtained in earlier work of Stanton, Zeng and the author. We also determine the maximum values of the parameters {\mathrm cr^{(\ell)} and {\mathrm cr^{(c)}.
