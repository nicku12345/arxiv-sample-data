We describe an algorithm for determining whether two convex polytopes P and Q, embedded in a lattice, are isomorphic with respect to a lattice automorphism. We extend this to a method for determining if P and Q are equivalent, i.e. whether there exists an affine lattice automorphism that sends P to Q. Methods for calculating the automorphism group and affine automorphism group of P are also described.   An alternative strategy is to determine a normal form such that P and Q are isomorphic if and only if their normal forms are equal. This is the approach adopted by Kreuzer and Skarke in their PALP software. We describe the Kreuzer-Skarke method in detail, and give an improved algorithm when P has many symmetries. Numerous examples, plus two appendices containing detailed pseudo-code, should help with any future reimplementations of these techniques. We conclude by explaining how to define and calculate the normal form of a Laurent polynomial.
