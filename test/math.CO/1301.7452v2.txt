Loehr and Warrington introduced partitional statistics \mbox{ctot}_{\frac{q}{p}}(D) and \mbox{midd}_{\frac{q}{p}}(D) and provided formulas for these statistics in terms of the boundary graph of the Young diagram D. In this paper we give a bijective proof of Loehr-Warrington's formulas using the following simple combinatorial observation: given a Young diagram D and two numbers a and l, the number of boxes in D with the arm length a and the leg length l is one less than the number of boxes with the same properties in the complement to D. Here the complement is taken inside the positive quadrant or, equivalently, a very large rectangle.
