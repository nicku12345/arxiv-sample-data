If eps > 0 and p >= n^{-1/2 + eps}, in a binomial random graph G(n,p) a.a.s. the set of cycles which can be constructed as a symmetric difference of Hamilton circuits is as large as parity by itself permits (all cycles if n is odd, all even cycles if n is even). Moreover, every p which ensures the above property a.a.s. must necessarily be such that for any constant c>0, eventually p >= (log n + 2 log log n + c)/n. So, whatever the smallest sufficient p for an a.a.s. Hamilton-generated cycle space might be, it does not coincide with the threshold for hamiltonicity of G(n,p).
