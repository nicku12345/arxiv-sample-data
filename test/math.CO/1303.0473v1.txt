The existence of a partial quadrangle {\mathsf{PQ}}(s, t, \mu) is equivalent to the existence of a diamond-free strongly regular graph {\mathsf{SRG}}(1+s(t+1)+s^2t(t+1)/\mu, s(t+1), s-1, \mu). Recently, it is shown that there exists a {\mathsf{PQ}}(2, (n^3+3n^2-2)/2, n^2+n) if and only if n\in\{1, 2, 4\}. Let \mathcal{S} be a {\mathsf{PQ}}(3,(n+3)(n^2-1)/3, n^2+n) such that for every two non-collinear points p_1 and p_2, there is a point q non-collinear with p_1, p_2, and all points collinear with both p_1 and p_2. In this article, we establish that \mathcal{S} exists only for n\in\{-2, 2, 3\} and probably n=10.
