P. J. Federico used the term low-order for perfect squared squares with at most 28 squares in their dissection. In 2010 low-order compound perfect squared squares (CPSSs) were completely enumerated. Up to symmetries of the square and its squared subrectangles there are 208 low-order CPSSs in orders 24 to 28. In 2012 the CPSSs of order 29 were completely enumerated, giving a total of 620 CPSSs up to order 29.
