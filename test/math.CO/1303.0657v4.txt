Two families \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B}, of k-subsets of an n-set, are {\em cross t-intersecting} if for every choice of subsets A \in \mathcal{A} and B \in \mathcal{B} we have |A \cap B| \geq t. We address the following conjectured cross t-intersecting version of the Erd\H os--Ko--Rado Theorem: For all n \geq (t+1)(k-t+1) the maximum value of |\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}| for two cross t-intersecting families \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \subset\binom{[n]}{k} is \binom{n-t}{k-t}^2. We verify this for all t \geq 14 except finitely many n and k for each fixed t. Further, we prove uniqueness and stability results in these cases, showing, for instance, that the families reaching this bound are unique up to isomorphism. We also consider a {\em p-weight} version of the problem, which comes from the product measure on the power set of an n-set.
