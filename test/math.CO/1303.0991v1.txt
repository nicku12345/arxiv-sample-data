A graph is called traceable if it contains a Hamilton path, i.e., a path passing through all its vertices. Let G be a graph on n vertices. G is called claw-o_{-1}-heavy if every induced claw (K_{1,3}) of G has a pair of nonadjacent vertices with degree sum at least n-1 in G. In this paper we show that a claw-o_{-1}-heavy graph G is traceable if we impose certain additional conditions on G involving forbidden induced subgraphs.
