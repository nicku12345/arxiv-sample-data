Given a G-space X and a non-trivial G-invariant ideal I of subsets of X, we prove that for every partition X=A_1\cup\dots\cup A_n of X into n\ge 2 pieces there is a piece A_i of the partition and a finite set F\subset G of cardinality |F|\le \phi(n+1):=\max_{1<x<n+1}\frac{x^{n+1-x}-1}{x-1} such that G=F\cdot \Delta(A_i) where \Delta(A_i)=\{g\in G:gA_i\cap A_i\notin I\} is the difference set of the set A_i. Also we investigate the growth of the sequence \phi(n)=\max_{1<x<n}\frac{x^{n-x}-1}{x-1} and show that \ln \phi(n)=nW(ne)-2n+\frac{n}{W(ne)}+\frac{W(ne)}{n}+O\big(\frac{\ln n}n\big) where W(x) is the Lambert W-function, defined implicitly as W(x)e^{W(x)}=x. This shows that \phi(n) grows faster that any exponent a^n but slower than the sequence of factorials n!.
