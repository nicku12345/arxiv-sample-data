We prove an Alexander-type duality for valuations for certain subcomplexes in the boundary of polyhedra. These strengthen and simplify results of Stanley (1974) and Miller-Reiner (2005). We give a generalization of Brion's theorem for this relative situation and we discuss the topology of the possible subcomplexes for which the duality relation holds.
