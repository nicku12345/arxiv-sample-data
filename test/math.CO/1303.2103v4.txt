Given an edge colouring of a graph with a set of m colours, we say that the graph is (exactly) m-coloured if each of the colours is used. The question of finding exactly m-coloured complete subgraphs was first considered by Erickson in 1994; in 1999, Stacey and Weidl partially settled a conjecture made by Erickson and raised some further questions. In this paper, we shall study, for a colouring of the edges of the complete graph on \mathbb{N} with exactly k colours, how small the set of natural numbers m for which there exists an m-coloured complete infinite subgraph can be. We prove that this set must have size at least \sqrt{2k}; this bound is tight for infinitely many values of k. We also obtain a version of this result for colourings that use infinitely many colours.
