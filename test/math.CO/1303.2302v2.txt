The derangement polynomial d_n (x) for the symmetric group enumerates derangements by the number of excedances. The derangement polynomial d^B_n(x) for the hyperoctahedral group is a natural type B analogue. A new combinatorial formula for this polynomial is given in this paper. This formula implies that d^B_n (x) decomposes as a sum of two nonnegative, symmetric and unimodal polynomials whose centers of symmetry differ by a half and thus provides a new transparent proof of its unimodality. A geometric interpretation, analogous to Stanley's interpretation of d_n (x) as the local h-polynomial of the barycentric subdivision of the simplex, is given to one of the summands of this decomposition. This interpretation leads to a unimodal decomposition and a new formula for the Eulerian polynomial of type B. The various decomposing polynomials introduced here are also studied in terms of recurrences, generating functions, combinatorial interpretations, expansions and real-rootedness.
