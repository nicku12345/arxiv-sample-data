Young's lattice L(m,n) consists of partitions having m parts of size at most n, ordered by inclusion of the corresponding Ferrers diagrams. K. O'Hara gave the first constructive proof of the unimodality of the Gaussian polynomials by expressing the underlying ranked set of L(m,n) as a disjoint union of products of centered rank-unimodal subsets. We construct a finer decomposition which is compatible with the partial order on Young's lattice, at the cost of replacing the cartesian product with a more general poset extension. As a corollary, we obtain an explicit chain decomposition which exhibits the rank-unimodality of L(m,n). Moreover, this set of chains is closed under the natural rank-flipping involution given by taking complements of Ferrers diagrams.
