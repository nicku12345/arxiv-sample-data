Given an edge colouring of a graph with a set of m colours, we say that the graph is (exactly) m-coloured if each of the colours is used. We consider edge colourings of the complete graph on \mathbb{N} with infinitely many colours and show that either one can find an m-coloured complete subgraph for every natural number m or there exists an infinite subset X \subset \mathbb{N} coloured in one of two canonical ways: either the colouring is injective on X or there exists a distinguished vertex v in X such that X \setminus \lbrace v \rbrace is 1-coloured and each edge between v and X \setminus \lbrace v \rbrace has a distinct colour (all different to the colour used on X \setminus \lbrace v \rbrace). This answers a question posed by Stacey and Weidl in 1999. The techniques that we develop also enable us to resolve some further questions about finding m-coloured complete subgraphs in colourings with finitely many colours.
