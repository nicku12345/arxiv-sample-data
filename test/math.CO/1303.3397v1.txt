We introduce the notion of an \emph{asymptotic triangulation} of the annulus. We show that asymptotic triangulations can be mutated as the usual triangulations and describe their exchange graph. Viewing asymptotic triangulations as limits of triangulations under the action of the mapping class group, we compactify the exchange graph of the triangulations of the annulus. The cases of tubes are also considered.
