We give a Littlewood-Richardson type rule for expanding the product of a row-strict quasisymmetric Schur function and a symmetric Schur function in terms of row-strict quasisymmetric Schur functions. We then discuss a family of polynomials called Demazure atoms. We review the known characterizations of these polynomials and then present two new characterizations. Finally, we consider a family of polynomials called permuted basement nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials which are obtained by permuting the basement of the combinatorial formula of Haglund, Haiman, and Loehr for nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. We show that these permuted basement nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials are the simultaneous eigenfunctions of a family of commuting operators in the double affine Hecke algebra.
