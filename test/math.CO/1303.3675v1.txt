We prove the following theorem, which is related to McMullen's problem on projective transformations of polytopes; let 2\leq k\leq \lfloor{\frac{d}{2}}\rfloor and \nu{(d, k)} be the largest number such that any set of \nu{(d,k)} points lying in general position in \mathbb{R}^d can be mapped by a permissible projective transformation onto the vertices of a k-neighborly polytope, then d + \left\lceil{\frac{d}{k}}\right\rceil +1 \leq \nu{(d, k)} < 2d-k +1.
