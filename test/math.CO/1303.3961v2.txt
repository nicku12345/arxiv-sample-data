We prove that in a random tournament the events \{s\rightarrow a\} and \{t\rightarrow b\} are positively correlated, for distinct vertices a,s,b,t \in K_n. It is also proven that the correlation between the events \{s\rightarrow a\} and \{t\rightarrow b\} in the random graphs G(n,p) and G(n,m) with random orientation is positive for every fixed p>0 and sufficiently large n (with m=\left\lfloor p \binom{n}{2}\right\rfloor). We conjecture it to be positive for all p and all n. An exact recursion for \P(\{s\rightarrow a\} \cap \{t\rightarrow b\}) in \gnp is given.
