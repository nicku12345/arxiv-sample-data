An antimagic labeling of a graph G with m edges is a bijection from E(G) to \{1,2,\ldots,m\} such that for all vertices u and v, the sum of labels on edges incident to u differs from that for edges incident to v. Hartsfield and Ringel conjectured that every connected graph other than the single edge K_2 has an antimagic labeling. We prove this conjecture for regular graphs of odd degree.
