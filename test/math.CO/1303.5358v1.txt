Given two sequences \fa=(a_n)_{n\geq 0} and \fb=(b_n)_{n\geq 0} of complex numbers such that their generating series are of the form \sum_{n\geq 0}a_n t^n=\frac{\fh(\fa)(t)}{(1-t)^{d_{\fa}}} and \sum_{n\geq 0}b_n t^n=\frac{\fh(\fb)(t)}{(1-t)^{d_{\fb}}}, where \fh(\fa)(t) and \fh(\fb)(t) are polynomials, we consider their Segre product \fa\ast\fb=(a_nb_n)_{n\geq 0}. We are interested in the bilinear transformations that compute the coefficient sequence of \fh(\fa\ast\fb)(t) from those of \fh(\fa)(t) and \fh(\fb)(t), where \sum_{n\geq 0}a_nb_n t^n=\frac{\fh(\fa\ast\fb)(t)}{(1-t)^{d_{\fa}+d_{\fb}-1}}. The motivation to study this problem comes from commutative algebra as the Hilbert series of the Segre product of two standard graded algebras equals the Segre product of the two individual Hilbert series. We provide an explicit description of these transformations and compute their spectra. In particular, we show that the transformation matrices are diagonalizable with integral eigenvalues. We also provide explicit formulae for the eigenvectors of the transformation matrices. Finally, we present a conjecture concerning the real-rootedness of \fh(\fa^{\ast r})(t) if r is large enough, where \fa^{\ast r}=\fa\ast\cdots\ast \fa is the r\textsuperscript{th} Segre product of the sequence \fa and the coefficients of \fh(\fa)(t) are assumed to be non-negative.
