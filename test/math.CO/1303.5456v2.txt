We discuss functions from the edges and vertices of a directed graph to an Abelian group. Such functions, when the sum of their values along any cycle is zero, are called balanced and form an Abelian group. We study this group in two cases: when we allowed to walk against the direction of an edge taking the opposite value of the function and when we are not allowed to walk against the direction.
