The action of the symmetric group S_n on the set Park_n of parking functions of size n has received a great deal of attention in algebraic combinatorics. We prove that the action of S_n on Park_n extends to an action of S_{n+1}. More precisely, we construct a graded S_{n+1}-module V_n such that the restriction of V_n to S_n is isomorphic to Park_n. We describe the S_n-Frobenius characters of the module V_n in all degrees and describe the S_{n+1}-Frobenius characters of V_n in extreme degrees. We give a bivariate generalization V_n^{(\ell, m)} of our module V_n whose representation theory is governed by a bivariate generalization of Dyck paths. A Fuss generalization of our results is a special case of this bivariate generalization.
