In PG(2,q^3), let \pi be a subplane of order q that is tangent to \ell_infty. The tangent splash of \pi is defined to be the set of q^2+1 points on \ell_infty that lie on a line of \pi. This article investigates properties of the tangent splash. We show that all tangent splashes are projectively equivalent, investigate sublines contained in a tangent splash, and consider the structure of a tangent splash in the Bruck-Bose representation of PG(2,q^3) in PG(6,q). We show that a tangent splash of PG(1,q^3) is a GF(q)-linear set of rank 3 and size q^2+1; this allows us to use results about linear sets from \cite{lavr10} to obtain properties of tangent splashes.
