We improve Larman's bound on the diameter of a polytope by showing that if \Delta is a normal simplicial complex, all of whose missing faces have size at most r, then the diameter of the facet-ridge graph of \Delta is not larger than 2^{r-2}n, where n is the number of vertices of \Delta. We then use this result to provide new upper bounds on the diameters of the facet-ridge graphs of k-neighborly spheres, r-stacked spheres, and polytopes with small g_r. Specifically, our bounds imply that r-stacked spheres with r=O(\log n) satisfy the polynomial Hirsch conjecture.
