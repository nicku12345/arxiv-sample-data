The domination polynomial of a graph is the polynomial whose coefficients count the number of dominating sets of each cardinality. A recent question asks which graphs are uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by their domination polynomial. In this paper, we completely describe the complete r-partite graphs which are; in the bipartite case, this settles in the affirmative a conjecture of Aalipour, Akbari and Ebrahimi.
