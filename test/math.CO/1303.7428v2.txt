Let {\cal T}_n be the full symmetric semigroup on X_n = \{1, 2,..., n\} and let {\cal OCT}_n and {\cal ORCT}_n be its subsemigroups of order-preserving and order-preserving or order-reversing full contraction mappings of X_n, respectively. In this paper we investigate the cardinalities of some equivalences on {\cal OCT}_n and {\cal ORCT}_n which lead naturally to obtaining the orders of these subsemigroups.
