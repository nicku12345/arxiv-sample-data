Let H=(V,E) be an r-uniform hypergraph. For each 1 \leq s \leq r-1, an s-path {\mathcal P}^{r,s}_n of length n in H is a sequence of distinct vertices v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{s+n(r-s)} such that \{v_{1+i(r-s)},\ldots, v_{s+(i+1)(r-s)}\}\in E(H) for each 0 \leq i \leq n-1.Recently, the Ramsey number of 1-paths in uniform hypergraphs has received a lot of attention. In this paper, we consider the Ramsey number of r/2-paths for even r. Namely, we prove the following exact result: R({\mathcal P}^{r,r/2}_n,{\mathcal P}^{r,r/2}_3)=R({\mathcal P}^{r,r/2}_n,{\mathcal P}^{r,r/2}_4)=\tfrac{(n+1)r}{2}+1.
