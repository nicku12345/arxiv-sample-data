Let t\ge 1 be a given integer. Let {\cal F} be a family of subsets of [m]=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}. Assume that for every pair of disjoint sets S,T\subset [m] with |S|=|T|=k, there do not exist 2t sets in {\cal F} where t subsets of {\cal F} contain S and are disjoint from T and t subsets of {\cal F} contain T and are disjoint from S. We show that |{\cal F}| is O(m^{k}).   Our main new ingredient is allowing, during the inductive proof, multisets of subsets of [m] where the multiplicity of a given set is bounded by t-1. We use a strong stability result of Anstee and Keevash. This is further evidence for a conjecture of Anstee and Sali. These problems can be stated in the language of matrices Let t\cdot M denote t copies of the matrix M concatenated together. We have established the conjecture for those configurations t\cdot F for any k\times 2 (0,1)-matrix F.
