The generalized k-connectivity \kappa_k(G) of a graph G, introduced by Hager in 1985, is a nice generalization of the classical connectivity. Recently, as a natural counterpart, we proposed the concept of generalized k-edge-connectivity \lambda_k(G). In this paper, graphs of order n such that \kappa_k(G)=n-\frac{k}{2}-1 and \lambda_k(G)=n-\frac{k}{2}-1 for even k are characterized.
