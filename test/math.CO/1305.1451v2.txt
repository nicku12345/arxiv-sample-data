Let \Sigma be a surface with boundary b(\Sigma), \mathcal{L} be a collection of k disjoint b(\Sigma)-paths in \Sigma, and P be a non-separating b(\Sigma)-path in \Sigma. We prove that there is a homeomorphism \phi: \Sigma \to \Sigma that fixes each point of b(\Sigma) and such that \phi(\mathcal{L}) meets P at most 2k times.   With this theorem, we derive explicit constants in the graph minor algorithms of Robertson and Seymour. We reprove a result concerning redundant vertices for graphs on surfaces, but with explicit bounds. That is, we prove that there exists a computable integer t:=t(\Sigma,k) such that if v is a 't-protected' vertex in a surface \Sigma, then v is redundant with respect to any k-linkage.
