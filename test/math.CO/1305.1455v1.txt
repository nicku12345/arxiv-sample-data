A t\text{-}(n,k,\lambda;q)-design is a set of k-subspaces, called blocks, of an n-dimensional vector space V over the finite field with q elements such that each t-subspace is contained in exactly \lambda blocks. A partition of the complete set of k-subspaces of V into disjoint t\text{-}(n,k,\lambda;q) designs is called a large set of t-designs over finite fields. In this paper we give the first nontrivial construction of such a large set with t\ge2.
