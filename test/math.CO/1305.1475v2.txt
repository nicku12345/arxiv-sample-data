The domination polynomials of binary graph operations, aside from union, join and corona, have not been widely studied. We compute and prove recurrence formulae and properties of the domination polynomials of families of graphs obtained by various products, ranging from explicit formulae and recurrences for specific families to more general results. As an application, we show the domination polynomial is computationally hard to evaluate.
