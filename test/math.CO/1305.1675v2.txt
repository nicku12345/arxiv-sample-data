In this short note, we prove the conjecture of Benjamini, Shinkar, and Tsur on the acquaintance time AC(G) of a random graph G \in G(n,p). It is shown that asymptotically almost surely AC(G) = O(\log n / p) for G \in G(n,p), provided that pn > (1+\epsilon) \log n for some \epsilon > 0 (slightly above the threshold for connectivity). Moreover, we show a matching lower bound for dense random graphs, which also implies that asymptotically almost surely K_n cannot be covered with o(\log n / p) copies of a random graph G \in G(n,p), provided that pn > n^{1/2+\epsilon} and p < 1-\epsilon for some \epsilon>0. We conclude the paper with a small improvement on the general upper bound showing that for any n-vertex graph G, we have AC(G) = O(n^2/\log n).
