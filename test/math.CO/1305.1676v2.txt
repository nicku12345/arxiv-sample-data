We consider k-cop-win graphs in the binomial random graph G(n,1/2). It is known that almost all cop-win graphs contain a universal vertex. We generalize this result and prove that for every k \in N, almost all k-cop-win graphs contain a dominating set of cardinality k. From this it follows that the asymptotic number of labelled k-cop-win graphs of order n is equal to (1+o(1)) (1-2^{-k})^{-k} {n \choose k} 2^{n^2/2 - (1/2-\log_2(1-2^{-k})) n}.
