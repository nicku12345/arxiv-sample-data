Skew Hadamard difference sets are an interesting topic of study for over seventy years. For a long time, it had been conjectured the classical Paley difference sets (the set of nonzero quadratic residues in \mathbb{F}_q where q \equiv 3 \bmod{4}) were the only example in abelian groups. In 2006, the first author and Yuan disproved this conjecture by showing that the image set of \mathcal{D}_5(x^2,u) is a new skew Hadamard difference set in (\mathbb{F}_{3^m},+) with m odd, where \mathcal{D}_n(x,u) denotes the first kind of Dickson polynomials of order n and u \in \mathbb{F}_q^*. The key observation in the proof is that \mathcal{D}_5(x^2,u) is a planar function from \mathbb{F}_{3^m} to \mathbb{F}_{3^m} for m odd. Since then a few families of new skew Hadamard difference sets have been discovered. In this paper, we prove that for all u \in \mathbb{F}_{3^m}^*, the set D_u := \{\mathcal{D}_7(x^2,u) : x \in \mathbb{F}_{3^m}^* \} is a skew Hadamard difference set in (\mathbb{F}_{3^m}, +), where m is odd and m \not \equiv 0 \pmod{3}. The proof is more complicated and different from that of Ding-Yuan skew Hadamard difference sets since \mathcal{D}_7(x^2,u) is not planar in \mathbb{F}_{3^m}. Furthermore, we show that such skew Hadamard difference sets are inequivalent to all existing ones for m = 5, 7 by comparing the triple intersection numbers.
