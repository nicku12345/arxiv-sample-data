We explain a highly efficient algorithm for playing the simplest type of dots and boxes endgame optimally (by which we mean "in such a way so as to maximise the number of boxes that you take"). The algorithm is sufficiently simple that it can be learnt and used in over-the-board games by humans. The types of endgames we solve come up commonly in practice in well-played games on a 5x5 board and were in fact developed by the authors in order to improve their over-the-board play.
