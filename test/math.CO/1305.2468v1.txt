An n\times n matrix M is called a fooling-set matrix of size n, if its diagonal entries are nonzero, whereas for every k\ne \ell we have M_{k,\ell} M_{\ell,k} = 0. Dietzfelbinger, Hromkovi\v{c}, and Schnitger (1996) showed that n \le (\rk M)^2, regardless of over which field the rank is computed, and asked whether the exponent on \rk M can be improved.   We settle this question for nonzero characteristic by constructing a family of matrices for which the bound is asymptotically tight. The construction uses linear recurring sequences.
