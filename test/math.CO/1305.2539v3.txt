In this paper we characterize "large" regular graphs using certain entries in the projection matrices onto the eigenspaces of the graph. As a corollary of this result, we show that "large" association schemes become P-polynomial association schemes. Our results are summarized as follows. Let G=(V,E) be a connected k-regular graph with d+1 distinct eigenvalues k=\theta_0>\theta_1>\cdots>\theta_d. Since the diameter of G is at most d, we have the Moore bound \[ |V| \leq M(k,d)=1+k \sum_{i=0}^{d-1}(k-1)^i. \] Note that if |V|> M(k,d-1) holds, the diameter of G is equal to d. Let E_i be the orthogonal projection matrix onto the eigenspace corresponding to \theta_i. Let \partial(u,v) be the path distance of u,v \in V.   Theorem. Assume |V|> M(k,d-1) holds. Then for x,y \in V with \partial(x,y)=d, the (x,y)-entry of E_i is equal to \[ -\frac{1}{|V|}\prod_{j=1,2,\ldots,d, j \ne i} \frac{\theta_0-\theta_j}{\theta_i-\theta_j}. \] If a symmetric association scheme \mathfrak{X}=(X,\{R_i\}_{i=0}^d) has a relation R_i such that the graph (X,R_i) satisfies the above condition, then \mathfrak{X} is P-polynomial. Moreover we show the "dual" version of this theorem for spherical sets and Q-polynomial association schemes.
