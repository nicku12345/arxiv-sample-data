The square G^2 of a graph G is the graph defined on V(G) such that two vertices u and v are adjacent in G^2 if the distance between u and v in G is at most 2. Let \chi(H) and \chi_l(H) be the chromatic number and the list chromatic number of H, respectively. A graph H is called {\em chromatic-choosable} if \chi_l (H) = \chi(H). It is an interesting problem to find graphs that are chromatic-choosable. Kostochka and Woodall \cite{KW2001} conjectured that \chi_l(G^2) = \chi(G^2) for every graph G, which is called List Square Coloring Conjecture. In this paper, we give infinitely many counterexamples to the conjecture. Moreover, we show that the value \chi_l(G^2) - \chi(G^2) can be arbitrary large.
