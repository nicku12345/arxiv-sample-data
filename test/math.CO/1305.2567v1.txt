The Kneser graph K(n,k) is the graph whose vertices are the k-elements subsets of an n-element set, with two vertices adjacent if the sets are disjoint. The square G^2 of a graph G is the graph defined on V(G) such that two vertices u and v are adjacent in G^2 if the distance between u and v in G is at most 2. Determining the chromatic number of the square of the Kneser graph K(2k+1, k) is an interesting problem, but not much progress has been made. Kim and Nakprasit \cite{2004KN} showed that \chi(K^2(2k+1,k)) \leq 4k+2, and Chen, Lih, and Wu \cite{2009CLW} showed that \chi(K^2(2k+1,k)) \leq 3k+2 for k \geq 3. In this paper, we give improved upper bounds on \chi(K^2(2k+1,k)). We show that \chi(K^2(2k+1,k)) \leq 2k+2, if  2k +1 = 2^n -1 for some positive integer n. Also we show that \chi(K^2(2k+1,k)) \leq \frac{8}{3}k+\frac{20}{3} for every integer k\ge 2. In addition to giving improved upper bounds, our proof is concise and can be easily understood by readers while the proof in \cite{2009CLW} is very complicated. Moreover, we show that \chi(K^2(2k+r,k))=\Theta(k^r) for each integer 2 \leq r \leq k-2.
