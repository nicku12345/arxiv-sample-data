This paper studies the on-line choice number on complete multipartite graphs with independence number m. We give a unified strategy for every prescribed m. Our main result leads to several interesting consequences comparable to known results. (1) If  k_1-\sum_{p=2}^m(\frac{p^2}{2}-\frac{3p}{2}+1)k_p\geq 0, where k_p denotes the number of parts of cardinality p, then G is on-line chromatic-choosable. (2) If  |V(G)|\leq\frac{m^2-m+2}{m^2-3m+4}\chi(G), then G is on-line chromatic-choosable. (3) The on-line choice number of regular complete multipartite graphs K_{m\star k} is at most (m+\frac{1}{2}-\sqrt{2m-2})k for m\geq 3.
