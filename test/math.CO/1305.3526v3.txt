Brooks' Theorem states that if a graph has \Delta\ge 3 and \omega \le \Delta, then \chi \le \Delta. Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that if \Delta\ge 9 and \omega\le \Delta-1, then \chi\le \Delta-1. We show that if \Delta\ge 13 and \omega \le \Delta-4, then \chi\le \Delta-1. For a graph G, let \mathcal{H} denote the subgraph of G induced by vertices of degree \Delta. We also show that if \omega\le \Delta-1 and \omega(\mathcal{H})\le \Delta-6, then \chi\le \Delta-1.
