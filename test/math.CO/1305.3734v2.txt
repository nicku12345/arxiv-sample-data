Let G be a simple graph of order n. The domination polynomial of G is the polynomial D(G,x) =\sum d(G, i)x^i, where d(G,i) is the number of dominating sets of G of size i. Every root of D(G,x) is called the domination root of G. It is clear that (0,\infty) is zero free interval for domination polynomial of a graph. It is interesting to investigate graphs which have complex domination roots with positive real parts. In this paper, we first investigate complexity of the domination polynomial at specific points. Then we present and investigate some families of graphs whose complex domination roots have positive real part.
