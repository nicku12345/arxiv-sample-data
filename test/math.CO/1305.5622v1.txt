Francisco Santos has described a new construction, per- turbing apart a non-simple face, to offer a counterexample to the Hirsch Conjecture. We offer two observations about this perturbed wedge con- struction, regarding its effect on edge-paths. First, that an all-but- simple spindle of dimension d and length d + 1 is a counterexample to the nonrevisiting conjecture. Second, that there are conditions under which the perturbed wedge construction does not increase the diameter. NOTE: These are simply working notes, offering two observations on the construction identified by Santos.
