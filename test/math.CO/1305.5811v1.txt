We study the continuous-time quantum walks on graphs in the adjacency algebra of the n-cube and its related distance regular graphs.   For k\geq 2, we find graphs in the adjacency algebra of (2^{k+2}-8)-cube that admit instantaneous uniform mixing at time \pi/2^k and graphs that have perfect state transfer at time \pi/2^k.   We characterize the folded n-cubes, the halved n-cubes and the folded halved n-cubes whose adjacency algebra contains a complex Hadamard matrix. We obtain the same conditions for the characterization of these graphs admitting instantaneous uniform mixing.
