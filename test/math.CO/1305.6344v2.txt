This paper proves a new general K-network constrained energy reliability global factorization theorem. As in the unconstrained case, beside its theoretical mathematical importance the theorem shows how to do parallel processing in exact network constrained energy reliability calculations in order to reduce the processing time of this NP-hard problem. Followed by a new simple factorization formula for its calculation, we propose a new definition of constrained energy network reliability motivated by the factorization theorem and the accomplishment of parallel processing, something impossible with the original definition.
