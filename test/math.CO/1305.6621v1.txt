Many combinatorial and topological invariants of a hyperplane arrangement can be computed in terms of its Tutte polynomial. Similarly, many invariants of a hypertoric arrangement can be computed in terms of its arithmetic Tutte polynomial. We compute the arithmetic Tutte polynomials of the classical root systems of types A,B,C, and D, with respect to their integer, root, and weight lattices. We do it in two ways: by introducing a finite field method for arithmetic Tutte polynomials, and by enumerating signed graphs with respect to six parameters.
