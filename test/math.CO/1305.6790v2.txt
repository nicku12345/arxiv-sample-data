We discuss an equivalence relation on the set of square binary matrices with the same number of 1's in each row and each column. Each binary matrix is represented using ordered n-tuples of natural numbers. We give a few starting values of integer sequences related to the discussed problem. The obtained sequences are new and they are not described in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). We show a relationship between some particular values of the parameters and the Fibonacci sequence.
