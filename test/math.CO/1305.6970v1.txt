This paper is continuation of the study of the 1-box pattern in permutations introduced by the authors in \cite{kitrem4}. We derive a two-variable generating function for the distribution of this pattern on 132-avoiding permutations, and then study some of its coefficients providing a link to the Fibonacci numbers. We also find the number of separable permutations with two and three occurrences of the 1-box pattern.
