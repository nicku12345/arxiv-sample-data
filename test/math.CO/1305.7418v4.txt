We provide a new strategy to compute the exponential growth constant of enumeration sequences counting walks in lattice path models restricted to the quarter plane. The bounds arise by comparison with half-planes models. In many cases the bounds are provably tight, and provide a combinatorial interpretation of recent formulas of Fayolle and Raschel (2012) and Bostan, Raschel and Salvy (2013). We discuss how to generalize to higher dimensions.
