We prove that every point-determining digraph D contains a vertex v such that D-v is also point determining. We apply this result to show that for any \{0,1\}-matrix M, with k diagonal zeros and \ell diagonal ones, the size of a minimal M-obstruction is at most (k+1)(\ell+1). This extends the results of Sumner, and of Feder and Hell, from undirected graphs and symmetric matrices to digraphs and general matrices.
