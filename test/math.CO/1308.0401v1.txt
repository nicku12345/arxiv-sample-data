The study of locally s-distance transitive graphs initiated by the authors in previous work, identified that graphs with a star quotient are of particular interest. This paper shows that the study of locally s-distance transitive graphs with a star quotient is equivalent to the study of a particular family of designs with strong symmetry properties that we call nicely affine and pairwise transitive. We show that a group acting regularly on the points of such a design must be abelian and give a general construction for this case.
