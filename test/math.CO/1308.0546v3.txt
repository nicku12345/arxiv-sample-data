Let G be a group acting on a set X of combinatorial objects, with finite orbits, and consider a statistic \xi : X \to \mathbb{C}. Propp and Roby defined the triple (X, G, \xi) to be \emph{homomesic} if for any orbits \mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2, the average value of the statistic \xi is the same, that is \[\frac{1}{{|\mathcal{O}_1|}}\sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_1} \xi(x) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{O}_2|}\sum_{y \in \mathcal{O}_2} \xi(y).\]   In 2013 Propp and Roby conjectured the following instance of homomesy. Let \mathrm{SSYT}_k(m \times n) denote the set of semistandard Young tableaux of shape m \times n with entries bounded by k. Let S be any set of boxes in the m \times n rectangle fixed under 180^\circ rotation. For T \in \mathrm{SSYT}_k(m \times n), define \sigma_S(T) to be the sum of the entries of T in the boxes of S. Let \langle \mathcal{P} \rangle be a cyclic group of order k where \mathcal{P} acts on \mathrm{SSYT}_k(m \times n) by promotion. Then (\mathrm{SSYT}_k(m \times n), \langle \mathcal{P} \rangle, \sigma_S) is homomesic.   We prove this conjecture, as well as a generalization to cominuscule posets. We also discuss analogous questions for tableaux with strictly increasing rows and columns under the K-promotion of Thomas and Yong, and prove limited results in that direction.
