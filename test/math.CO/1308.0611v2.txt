A weighting of the edges of a hypergraph is called vertex-coloring if the weighted degrees of the vertices yield a proper coloring of the graph, i.e., every edge contains at least two vertices with different weighted degrees. In this paper we show that such a weighting is possible from the weight set {1,2,...,r+1} for all hypergraphs with maximum edge size r>3 and not containing edges solely consisting of identical vertices. The number r+1 is best possible for this statement.   Further, the weight set {1,2,3,4,5} is sufficient for all hypergraphs with maximum edge size 3, up to some trivial exceptions.
