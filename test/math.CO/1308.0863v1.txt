In this paper, we show that the r-Stirling numbers of both kinds, the r-Whitney numbers of both kinds, the r-Lah numbers and the r-Whitney-Lah numbers form particular cases of family of polynomials forming a generalization of the partial Bell polynomials. We deduce the generating functions of several restrictions of these numbers. In addition, a new combinatorial interpretations is presented for the r-Whitney numbers and the r-Whitney-Lah numbers.
