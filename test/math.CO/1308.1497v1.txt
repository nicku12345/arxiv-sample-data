For a group G and a natural number m, a subset A of G is called m-thin if, for each finite subset F of G, there exists a finite subset K of G such that |Fg\cap A|\leqslant m for every g\in G\setminus K. We show that each m-thin subset of a group G of cardinality \aleph_n, n= 0,1,... can be partitioned into \leqslant m^{n+1} 1-thin subsets. On the other side, we construct a group G of cardinality \aleph_\omega and point out a 2-thin subset of G which cannot be finitely partitioned into 1-thin subsets.
