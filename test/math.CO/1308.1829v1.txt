A t\text{-}(n,K,\lambda;q) design, also called the q-analog of a t-wise balanced design, is a set {\mathcal B} of subspaces with dimensions contained in K of the n-dimensional vector space {\mathbb F}_q^n over the finite field with q elements such that each t-subspace of {\mathbb F}_q^n is contained in exactly \lambda elements of {\mathcal B}. In this paper we give a construction of an infinite series of nontrivial t\text{-}(n,K,\lambda;q) designs with |K|=2 for all dimensions t\ge 1 and all prime powers q admitting the standard Borel subgroup as group of automorphisms. Furthermore, replacing q=1 gives an ordinary t-wise balanced design defined on sets.
