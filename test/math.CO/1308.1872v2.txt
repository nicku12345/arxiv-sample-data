Let G be an abelian group of cardinality N, where (N,6) = 1, and let A be a random subset of G. Form a graph Gamma_A on vertex set G by joining x to y if and only if x + y is in A. Then, almost surely as N tends to infinity, the chromatic number chi(Gamma_A) is at most (1 + o(1))N/2 log_2 N. This is asymptotically sharp when G = Z/NZ, N prime.
