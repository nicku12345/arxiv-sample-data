A set S of vertices of a graph G is a defensive k-alliance in G if every vertex of S has at least k more neighbors inside of S than outside. This is primarily an expository article surveying the principal known results on defensive alliances in graph. Its seven sections are: Introduction, Computational complexity and realizability, Defensive k-alliance number, Boundary defensive k-alliances, Defensive alliances in Cartesian product graphs, Partitioning a graph into defensive k-alliances, and Defensive k-alliance free sets.
