In his study of Ramanujan-Sato type series for 1/\pi, Sun introduced a sequence of polynomials S_n(q) as given by S_n(q)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}{2k\choose k}{2(n-k)\choose n-k}q^k, and he conjectured that the polynomials S_n(q) are q-log-convex. By imitating a result of Liu and Wang on generating new q-log-convex sequences of polynomials from old ones, we obtain a sufficient condition for determining the q-log-convexity of self-reciprocal polynomials. Based on this criterion, we then give an affirmative answer to Sun's conjecture.
