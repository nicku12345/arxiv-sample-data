In this paper, a hub refers to a non-terminal vertex of degree at least three. We study the minimum number of hubs needed in a network to guarantee certain flow demand constraints imposed between multiple pairs of sources and sinks. We prove that under the constraints, regardless of the size or the topology of the network, such minimum number is always upper bounded and we derive tight upper bounds for some special parameters. In particular, for two pairs of sources and sinks, we present a novel path-searching algorithm, the analysis of which is instrumental for the derivations of the tight upper bounds.
