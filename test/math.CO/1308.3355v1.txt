Bent functions are of great importance in both mathematics and information science. The \mathcal{P}\mathcal{S} class of bent functions was introduced by Dillon in 1974, but functions belonging to this class that can be explicitly represented are only the \mathcal{P}\mathcal{S}_{\text{ap}} functions, which were also constructed by Dillon after his introduction of the \mathcal{P}\mathcal{S} class. In this paper, a technique of using finite pre-quasifield spread from finite geometry to construct \mathcal{P}\mathcal{S} bent functions is proposed. The constructed functions are in similar styles with the \mathcal{P}\mathcal{S}_{\text{ap}} functions. To explicitly represent them in bivariate forms, the main task is to compute compositional inverses of certain parametric permutation polynomials over finite fields of characteristic 2. Concentrated on the Dempwolff-M\"uller pre-quasifield, the Knuth pre-semifield and the Kantor pre-semifield, three new subclasses of the \mathcal{P}\mathcal{S} class are obtained. They are the only sub-classes that can be explicitly constructed more than 30 years after the \mathcal{P}\mathcal{S}_{\text{ap}} subclass was introduced.
