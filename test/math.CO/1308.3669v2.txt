Suppose s and t are coprime natural numbers. A theorem of Olsson says that the t-core of an s-core partition is again an s-core. We generalise this theorem, showing that the s-weight of the t-core of a partition \lambda is at most the s-weight of \lambda. Then we consider the set \mathcal C_{s:t} of partitions for which equality holds, which we call [s{:}t]-cores; this set has interesting structure, and we expect that it will be the subject of future study. We show that the set of [s{:}t]-cores is a union of finitely many orbits for an action of a Coxeter group of type \tilde A_{s-1}\times\tilde A_{t-1} on the set of partitions. We also consider the problem of constructing an [s{:}t]-core with specified s-core and t-core.
