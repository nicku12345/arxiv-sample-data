Assume that \nu is a positive integer and \delta=0, 1 or 2. In this paper we introduce the orthogonal graph \Gamma^{2\nu+\delta} over a Galois ring of odd characteristic and prove that it is arc transitive. Moreover, we compute its parameters as a quasi-strongly regular graph. In particular, we show that \Gamma^{2+\delta} is a strongly regular graph and \Gamma^{2\nu+1} is a strictly Deza graph when \nu\geq 2.
