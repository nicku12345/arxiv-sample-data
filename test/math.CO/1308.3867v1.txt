The imbalance of an edge e=\{u,v\} in a graph is defined as i(e)=|d(u)-d(v)|, where d(\cdot) is the vertex degree. The irregularity I(G) of G is then defined as the sum of imbalances over all edges of G. This concept was introduced by Albertson who proved that I(G) \leq \frac{n^{3}}{27} (where n=|V(G)|) and obtained stronger bounds for bipartite and triangle-free graphs. Since then a number of additional bounds were given by various authors. In this paper we prove a new upper bound, which improves a bound found by Zhou and Luo in 2011. Our bound involves the Laplacian spectral radius \lambda.
