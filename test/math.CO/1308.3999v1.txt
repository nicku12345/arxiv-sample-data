We give a method of generating strongly polynomial sequences of graphs, i.e., sequences (H_{\mathbf{k}}) indexed by a multivariate parameter \mathbf{k}=(k_1,\ldots, k_h) such that, for each fixed graph G, there is a multivariate polynomial p(G;x_1,\ldots, x_h) such that the number of homomorphisms from G to H_{\mathbf{k}} is given by the evaluation p(G;k_1,\ldots, k_h). A classical example is the sequence (K_k) of complete graphs, for which {\rm hom}(G,K_k)=P(G;k) is the evaluation of the chromatic polynomial at k. Our construction produces a large family of graph polynomials that includes the Tutte polynomial, the Averbouch-Godlin-Makowsky polynomial and the Tittmann-Averbouch-Makowsky polynomial. We also introduce a new graph parameter, the {\em branching core size} of a simple graph, related to how many involutive automorphisms with fixed points it has. We prove that a countable family of graphs of bounded branching core size (which in particular implies bounded tree-depth) is always contained in a finite union of strongly polynomial sequences.
