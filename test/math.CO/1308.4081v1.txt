Goldman, Joichi, and White proved a beautiful theorem showing that the falling factorial generating function for the rook numbers of a Ferrers board factors over the integers. Briggs and Remmel studied an analogue of rook placements where rows are replaced by sets of m rows called levels. They proved a version of the factorization theorem in that setting, but only for certain Ferrers boards. We generalize this result to any Ferrers board as well as giving a p,q-analogue. We also consider a dual situation involving weighted file placements which permit more than one rook in the same row. In both settings, we discuss properties of the resulting equivalence classes such as the number of elements in a class. In addition, we prove analogues of a theorem of Foata and Sch\"utzenberger giving a distinguished representative in each class as well as make connections with the q,t-Catalan numbers. We end with some open questions raised by this work.
