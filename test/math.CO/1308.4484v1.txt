We consider a non-degenerate conic in \PG(2,q^2), q odd, that is tangent to \ell_\infty and look at its structure in the Bruck-Bose representation in \PG(4,q). We determine which combinatorial properties of this set of points in \PG(4,q) are needed to reconstruct the conic in \PG(2,q^2). That is, we define a set \C in \PG(4,q) with q^2 points that satisfies certain combinatorial properties. We then show that if q\ge 7, we can use \C to construct a regular spread \S in the hyperplane at infinity of \PG(4,q), and that \C corresponds to a conic in the Desarguesian plane \P(\S)\cong\PG(2,q^2) constructed via the Bruck-Bose correspondence.
