The m-Tamari lattices \mathcal{T}_{n}^{(m)}, introduced by Bergeron and Pr{\'e}ville-Ratelle, are defined as a poset of m-Dyck paths equipped with the generalized rotation order, and constitute a Fuss-Catalan generalization of the classical Tamari lattices \mathcal{T}_{n}. While for \mathcal{T}_{n} many combinatorial realizations are known, to present there is no further combinatorial realization of \mathcal{T}_{n}^{(m)}. In this article, we introduce a certain decomposition of m-Dyck paths into m-tuples of Dyck paths, and after a certain modification of these m-tuples, we conjecture that the resulting m-tuples of Dyck paths realize \mathcal{T}_{n}^{(m)} as an induced subposet of the m-fold direct product of \mathcal{T}_{n} with itself. We are able to prove this conjecture for n\leq 3, and provide necessary conditions for m-tuples of Dyck paths to belong to this realization. However, for n\geq 5, no sufficient condition is known.
