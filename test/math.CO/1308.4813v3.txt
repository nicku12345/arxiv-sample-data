For positive integers m and k, we introduce a family of lattices \mathcal{C}_{k}^{(m)} associated to the Cambrian lattice \mathcal{C}_{k} of the dihedral group I_{2}(k). We show that \mathcal{C}_{k}^{(m)} satisfies some basic properties of a Fuss-Catalan generalization of \mathcal{C}_{k}, namely that \mathcal{C}_{k}^{(1)}=\mathcal{C}_{k} and \bigl\lvert\mathcal{C}_{k}^{(m)}\bigr\rvert=\mbox{Cat}^{(m)}\bigl(I_{2}(k)\bigr). Subsequently, we prove some structural and topological properties of these lattices---namely that they are trim and EL-shellable---which were known for \mathcal{C}_{k} before. Remarkably, our construction coincides in the case k=3 with the m-Tamari lattice of parameter 3 due to Bergeron and Pr{\'e}ville-Ratelle. Eventually, we investigate this construction in the context of other Coxeter groups, in particular we conjecture that the lattice completion of the analogous construction for the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_{n} and the long cycle (1\;2\;\ldots\;n) is isomorphic to the m-Tamari lattice of parameter n.
