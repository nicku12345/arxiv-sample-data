A permutation \sigma of a multiset is called Stirling permutation if \sigma(s)\ge \sigma(i) as soon as \sigma(i)=\sigma(j) and i<s<j. In our paper we study Stirling polynomials that arise in the generating function for descent statistics on Stirling permutations of any multiset. We develop generalizations of the classical Stirling numbers and present their combinatorial interpretations. Particularly, we apply the theory of P-partitions. Using certain specifications we also introduce the Stirling numbers of odd type and generalizations of the central factorial numbers.
