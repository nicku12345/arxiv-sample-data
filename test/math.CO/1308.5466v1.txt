Given two disjoint copies of a graph G, denoted G^1 and G^2, and a permutation \pi of V(G), the graph \pi G is constructed by joining u \in V(G^1) to \pi(u) \in V(G^2) for all u \in V(G^1). G is said to be a universal fixer if the domination number of \pi G is equal to the domination number of G for all \pi of V(G). In 1999 it was conjectured that the only universal fixers are the edgeless graphs. Since then, a few partial results have been shown. In this paper, we prove the conjecture completely.
