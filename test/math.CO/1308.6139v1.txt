A \emph{self-complementary} graph is a graph isomorphic to its complement. An isomorphism between G and its complement, viewed as a permutation of V(G), is then called an \emph{antimorphism}. A \emph{skew partition} of G is a partition of V(G) into 4 sets A,B,C,D such that there is no edge between A,B and every possible edge between C,D. A \emph{symmetric partition} of G is a partition of V(G) into 4 sets A,B,C,D such that there is no edge between A, D, no edge between B, C, every possible edge between A,B and every possible edge between C,D.   We give a new proof of a theorem of Gibbs saying that every self-complementary graph on 4k vertices has k disjoint paths on 4 vertices as induced subgraph. This new proof gives more structural information than the original one. We conjecture that every self-complementary graph on 4k vertices either has an induced cycle on 5 vertices, or a skew partition, or a symmetric partition. The new proof of Gibb's theorem yields a proof of the conjecture for the self-complementary graphs that have an antimorphism that is the product of a two circular permutations, one of them of length 4.
