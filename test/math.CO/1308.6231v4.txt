Equidistant codes over vector spaces are considered. For k-dimensional subspaces over a large vector space the largest code is always a sunflower. We present several simple constructions for such codes which might produce the largest non-sunflower codes. A novel construction, based on the Pl\"{u}cker embedding, for 1-intersecting codes of k-dimensional subspaces over \F_q^n, n \geq \binom{k+1}{2}, where the code size is \frac{q^{k+1}-1}{q-1} is presented. Finally, we present a related construction which generates equidistant constant rank codes with matrices of size n \times \binom{n}{2} over \F_q, rank n-1, and rank distance n-1.
