We consider the class {\cal A} of graphs that contain no odd hole, no antihole, and no "prism" (a graph consisting of two disjoint triangles with three disjoint paths between them). We prove that every graph G\in{\cal A} different from a clique has an "even pair" (two vertices that are not joined by a chordless path of odd length), as conjectured by Everett and Reed [see the chapter "Even pairs" in the book {\it Perfect Graphs}, J.L. Ram\'{\i}rez-Alfons\'{\i}n and B.A. Reed, eds., Wiley Interscience, 2001]. Our proof is a polynomial-time algorithm that produces an even pair with the additional property that the contraction of this pair yields a graph in {\cal A}. This entails a polynomial-time algorithm, based on successively contracting even pairs, to color optimally every graph in {\cal A}. This generalizes several results concerning some classical families of perfect graphs.
