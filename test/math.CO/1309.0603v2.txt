A non-isolated vertex x\in V(G) is called C_{3}-free if x belongs to no triangle of G. In \cite{BMW} Burger, Mynhardt and Weakley introduced the idea of universal fixers. Let G=(V,E) be a graph with n vertices and G' a copy of G. For a bijective function \pi:V(G)\mapsto V (G'), we define the prism \pi G of G as follows: V(\pi G)=V(G)\cup V(G') and E(\pi G)=E(G)\cup E(G')\cup M_{\pi}, where M_{\pi}=\{u\pi (u): u\in V(G)\}. Let \gamma(G) be the domination number of G. If \gamma(\pi G)=\gamma(G) for any bijective function \pi, then G is called a universal fixer. In \cite{MX} it is conjectured that the only universal fixer is the edgeless graph \bar{K_n}. In this note, we prove that any graph G with C_3-free vertices is not a universal fixer graph.
