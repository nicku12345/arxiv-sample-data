An ear in a triangulation T of a convex n-gon P is a triangle of T that shares two sides with P itself. Certain enumerational and structural problems become easier when one considers only triangulations with few ears. We demonstrate this in two ways. First, for k=2, 3, we find the number of symmetry classes of triangulations with k ears. Second, for k=2, 3, we determine the number of triangulations disjoint from a given triangulation: this number depends only on n for k=2, and only on lengths of branches of the dual tree for k=3.
