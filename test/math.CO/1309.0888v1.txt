The kth power G^k of a graph G is the graph defined on V(G) such that two vertices u and v are adjacent in G^k if the distance between u and v in G is at most k. Let \chi(H) and \chi_l(H) be the chromatic number and the list chromatic number of H, respectively. A graph H is called {\em chromatic-choosable} if \chi_l (H) = \chi(H). It is an interesting problem to find graphs that are chromatic-choosable. A natural question raised by Xuding Zhu (2012) is whether there exists a constant integer k such that G^k is chromatic-choosable for every graph G. Motivated by the List Total Coloring Conjecture, Kostochka and Woodall (2001) asked whether G^2 is chromatic-choosable for every graph G. Kim and Park (2013) answered the Kostochka and Woodall's question in the negative by finding a family of graphs whose squares are complete multipartite graphs with partite sets of equal and unbounded size. In this paper, we answer Zhu's question by showing that for every integer k \geq 2, there exists a graph G such that G^k is not chromatic-choosable. Moreover, for any fixed k we show that the value \chi_l(G^k) - \chi(G^k) can be arbitrarily large.
