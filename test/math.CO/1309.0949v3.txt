In this paper we prove a q-analogue of Koshy's formula in terms of the Narayana polynomial due to Lassalle and a q-analogue of Koshy's formula in terms of q-hypergeometric series due to Andrews by applying the inclusion-exclusion principle on Dyck paths and on partitions. We generalize these two q-analogues of Koshy's formula for q-Catalan numbers to that for q-Ballot numbers. This work also answers an open question by Lassalle and two questions raised by Andrews in 2010. We conjecture that if n is odd, then for m\ge n\ge 1, the polynomial (1+q^n){m\brack n-1}_q is unimodal. If n is even, for any even j\ne 0 and m\ge n\ge 1, the polynomial (1+q^n)[j]_q{m\brack n-1}_q is unimodal. This implies the answer to the second problem posed by Andrews.
