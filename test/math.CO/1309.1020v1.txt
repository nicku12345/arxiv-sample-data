In 1968, Erd\"os and Lov\'asz conjectured that for every graph G and all integers s,t\geq 2 such that s+t-1=\chi(G) > \omega(G), there exists a partition (S,T) of the vertex set of G such that \chi(G|S)\geq s and \chi(G|T)\geq t. For general graphs, the only settled cases of the conjecture are when s and t are small. Recently, the conjecture was proved for a few special classes of graphs: graphs with stability number 2 \cite{quasi-line}, line graphs \cite{line} and quasi-line graphs \cite{quasi-line}. In this paper, we consider the conjecture for claw-free graphs and present some progress on it.
