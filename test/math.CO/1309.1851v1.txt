A matrix H=[d_{ij}] is a generalized Hadamard matrix of order u\lambda with entries from U which is a finite group of order u (for short \mathrm{GH}(u,\,\lambda)) such that whenever i\neq \ell the set \{d_{ij}d_{\ell j}^{-1}\,|\, 1\leq j\leq u\lambda \} contains each element of U exactly \lambda times. In this paper, we construct \mathrm{GH}(q,\,q)'s and \mathrm{GH}(q,\,q^{2})'s over additive groups of finite fields \mathrm{GF}(q)'s by using some sorts of functions.
