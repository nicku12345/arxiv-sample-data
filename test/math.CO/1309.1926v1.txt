We prove a decomposition theorem for graphs that do not contain a subdivision of K_4 as an induced subgraph where K_4 is the complete graph on four vertices. We obtain also a structure theorem for the class \cal C of graphs that contain neither a subdivision of K_4 nor a wheel as an induced subgraph, where a wheel is a cycle on at least four vertices together with a vertex that has at least three neighbors on the cycle. Our structure theorem is used to prove that every graph in \cal C is 3-colorable and entails a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for membership in \cal C. As an intermediate result, we prove a structure theorem for the graphs whose cycles are all chordless.
