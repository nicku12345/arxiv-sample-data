More than twenty-five years ago, Manickam, Mikl\'{o}s, and Singhi conjectured that for positive integers n,k with n \geq 4k, every set of n real numbers with nonnegative sum has at least \binom{n-1}{k-1} k-element subsets whose sum is also nonnegative. We verify this conjecture when n \geq 8k^{2}, which simultaneously improves and simplifies a bound of Alon, Huang, and Sudakov and also a bound of Pokrovskiy when k < 10^{45}.   Moreover, our arguments resolve the vector space analogue of this conjecture. Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over a finite field. Assign a real-valued weight to each 1-dimensional subspace in V so that the sum of all weights is zero. Define the weight of a subspace S \subset V to be the sum of the weights of all the 1-dimensional subspaces it contains. We prove that if n \geq 3k, then the number of k-dimensional subspaces in V with nonnegative weight is at least the number of k-dimensional subspaces in V that contain a fixed 1-dimensional subspace. This result verifies a conjecture of Manickam and Singhi from 1988.
