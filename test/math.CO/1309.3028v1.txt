For a set of permutation patterns \Pi, let F^\text{st}_n(\Pi,q) be the st-polynomial of permutations avoiding all patterns in \Pi. Suppose 312\in\Pi. For a class of permutation statistics which includes inversion and descent statistics, we give a formula that expresses F^\text{st}_n(\Pi;q) in terms of these st-polynomials where we take some subblocks of the patterns in \Pi. Using this formula, we can construct many examples of nontrivial st-Wilf equivalences. In particular, this disproves a conjecture by Dokos, Dwyer, Johnson, Sagan, and Selsor that all \text{inv}-Wilf equivalences are trivial.
