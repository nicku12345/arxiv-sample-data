We consider the family of graphs whose vertex set is \mathbb{Z}^n where two vertices are connected by an edge when their \ell_\infty-distance is 1. Towards an edge isoperimetric inequality for this graph, we calculate the edge boundary of any finite set S \subset \mathbb{Z}^n. This boundary calculation leads to a desire to show that a set with optimal edge boundary has no ``gaps'' in any direction \epsilon \in \{-1,0,1\}^n, \epsilon \not=0. We show that one can find a set with optimal edge boundary that does not have gaps in any direction e_i (or -e_i) where e_i is the standard basis vector.
