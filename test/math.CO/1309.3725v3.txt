Let G be a group acting faithfully and transitively on \Omega_i for i=1,2. A famous theorem by Burnside implies the following fact: If |\Omega_1|=|\Omega_2| is a prime and the rank of one of the actions is greater than two, then the actions are equivalent, or equivalently |(\alpha,\beta)^G|=|\Omega_1|=|\Omega_2| for some (\alpha,\beta)\in \Omega_1\times \Omega_2.   In this paper we consider a combinatorial analogue to this fact through the theory of coherent configurations, and give some arithmetic sufficient conditions for a coherent configuration with two homogeneous components of prime order to be uniquely determined by one of the homogeneous components.
