Generalizing recent results of Egge and Mongelli, we show that each diagonal sequence of the Jacobi-Stirling numbers \js(n,k;z) and \JS(n,k;z) is a P\'olya frequency sequence if and only if z\in [-1, 1] and study the z-total positivity properties of these numbers. Moreover, the polynomial sequences \biggl\{\sum_{k=0}^n\JS(n,k;z)y^k\biggr\}_{n\geq 0}\quad \text{and} \quad \biggl\{\sum_{k=0}^n\js(n,k;z)y^k\biggr\}_{n\geq 0} are proved to be strongly \{z,y\}-log-convex. In the same vein, we extend a recent result of Chen et al. about the Ramanujan polynomials to Chapoton's generalized Ramanujan polynomials. Finally, bridging the Ramanujan polynomials and a sequence arising from the Lambert W function, we obtain a neat proof of the unimodality of the latter sequence, which was proved previously by Kalugin and Jeffrey.
