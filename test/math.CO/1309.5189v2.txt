Let \mathbb{P}_n be the set of all matrices which have the same zero patterns with some permutation matrix of order n.   In this paper, we prove the following result: Let \mathbb{I} be the unit tensor of order m\ge3 and dimension n\ge2. Suppose that P and Q are two matrices with P\mathbb{I}Q=\mathbb{I}, then P,Q\in \mathbb{P}_n. This gives a characterization for the similarities of tensors with order m\ge3.
