We consider d-dimensional lattice polytopes \Delta with h^*-polynomial h^*_\Delta=1+h_k^*t^k for 1<k<(d+1)/2 and relate them to some abelian subgroups of \SL_{d+1}(\C) of order 1+h_k^*=p^r where p is a prime number. These subgroups can be investigate by means of coding theory as special linear constant weight codes in \F_p^{d+1}. If p =2, then the classication of these codes and corresponding lattice polytopes can be obtained using a theorem of Bonisoli. If p > 2, the main technical tool in the classification of these linear codes is the non-vanishing theorem for generalized Bernoulli numbers B_{1,\chi}^{(r)} associated with odd characters \chi:\F_q^*\to\C^* where q=p^r. Our result implies a complete classification of all lattice polytopes whose h^*-polynomial is a binomial.
