We give upper and lower bounds for the spectral radius of a nonnegative matrix by using its average 2-row sums, and characterize the equality cases if the matrix is irreducible. We also apply these bounds to various nonnegative matrices associated with a graph, including the adjacency matrix, the signless Laplacian matrix, the distance matrix, the distance signless Laplacian matrix, and the reciprocal distance matrix.
