The aim of this paper is to develop analytic techniques to deal with certain monotonicity of combinatorial sequences. (1) A criterion for the monotonicity of the function \sqrt[x]{f(x)} is given, which is a continuous analog for one result of Wang and Zhu. (2) The log-behavior of the functions \theta(x)=\sqrt[x]{2 \zeta(x)\Gamma(x+1)} and F(x)=\sqrt[x]{\frac{\Gamma(ax+b+1)}{\Gamma(c x+d+1)\Gamma(e x+f+1)}} is considered, where \zeta(x) and \Gamma(x) are the Riemann zeta function and the Euler Gamma function, respectively. As consequences, the strict log-concavities of the function \theta(x) (a conjecture of Chen {\it et al.}) and \{\sqrt[n]{z_n}\} for some combinatorial sequences (including the Bernoulli numbers, the Tangent numbers, the Catalan numbers, the Fuss-Catalan numbers and some Binomial coefficients) are demonstrated. In particular, this contains some results of Chen {\it et al.}, Luca and St\u{a}nic\u{a}. (3). By researching logarithmically complete monotonicity of some functions, the infinite log-monotonicity of the sequence \{\frac{(n_{0}+ia)!}{(k_0+ib)!(\overline{k_0}+i\overline{b})!}\}_{i\geq0} is proved. This generalizes two results of Chen {\it et al.} that both the Catalan numbers \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n} and central binomial coefficients \binom{2n}{n} are infinitely log-monotonic and strengths one result of Su and Wang that \binom{dn}{\delta n} is log-convex in n. (4) The asymptotically infinite log-monotonicity of derangement numbers is showed. (5)The logarithmically complete monotonicity of functions 1/\sqrt[x]{a \zeta(x+b)\Gamma(x+c)} and \sqrt[x]{\rho\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{\Gamma(x+a_i)}{\Gamma(x+b_i)}} is also obtained, which generalizes the results of Lee and Tepedelenlio\v{g}lu, Qi and Li.
