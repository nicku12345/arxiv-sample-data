The study of `structure' on subsets of abelian groups, with small `doubling constant', has been well studied in the last fifty years, from the time Freiman initiated the subject. In \cite{DF} Deshouillers and Freiman establish a structure theorem for subsets of \n with small doubling constant. In the current article we provide an alternate proof of one of the main theorem of \cite{DF}. Also our proof leads to slight improvement of the theorems in \cite{DF}.
