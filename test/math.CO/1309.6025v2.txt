A sequence \{z_n\}_{n\geq0} is called ratio log-convex in the sense that the ratio sequence \{\frac{z_{n+1}}{z_n}\}_{n\geq0} is log-convex. Based on a three-term recurrence for sequences, we develop techniques for dealing with the ratio log-convexity of ratio sequences. As applications, we prove that the ratio sequences of numbers, including the derangement numbers, the Motzkin numbers, the Fine numbers, Franel numbers and the Domb numbers are ratio log-convex, respectively. Finally, we not only prove that the sequence of derangement numbers is asymptotically infinitely log-monotonic, but also show some infinite log-monotonicity of some numbers related to the Gamma function, in particular, implying two results of Chen {\it et al.} on the infinite log-monotonicity of the Catalan numbers and the central binomial coefficients.
