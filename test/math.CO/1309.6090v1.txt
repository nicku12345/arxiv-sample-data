A graph G is said to be \textit{determined by its generalized spectrum} (DGS for short) if for any graph H, H and G are cospectral with cospectral complements implies that H is isomorphic to G. In \cite{WX,WX1}, Wang and Xu gave some methods for determining whether a family of graphs are DGS. In this paper, we shall review some of the old results and present some new ones along this line of research.
