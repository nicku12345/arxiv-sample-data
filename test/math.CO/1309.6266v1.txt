In this paper we extend the concept of energy to signed digraphs. We obtain Coulson's integral formula for energy of signed digraphs. Formulae for energies of signed directed cycles are computed and it is shown that energy of non cycle balanced signed directed cycles increases monotonically with respect to number of vertices. Characterization of signed digraphs having energy equal to zero is given. We extend the concept of non complete extended p sum (or briefly, NEPS) to signed digraphs. An infinite family of equienergetic signed digraphs is constructed. Moreover, we extend McClelland's inequality to signed digraphs and also obtain sharp upper bound for energy of signed digraph in terms the number of arcs. Some open problems are also given at the end.
