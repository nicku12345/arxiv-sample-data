The problem of determining the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that does not contain a 4-cycle has a rich history in extremal graph theory. Using Sidon sets constructed by Bose and Chowla, for each odd prime power q we construct a graph with q^2 - q - 2 vertices that does not contain a 4-cycle and has at least \frac{1}{2}q^3 - q^2 - O(q^{3/4}) edges. This disproves a conjecture of Abreu, Balbuena, and Labbate concerning the Tur\'{a}n number \mathrm{ex}(q^2 - q - 2, C_4).
