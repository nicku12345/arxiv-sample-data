Recently, Kim and Park have found an infinite family of graphs whose squares are not chromatic-choosable. Xuding Zhu asked whether there is some k such that all kth power graphs are chromatic-choosable. We answer this question in the negative: we show that there is a positive constant c such that for any k there is a family of graphs G with \chi(G^k) unbounded and \chi_{\ell}(G^k)\geq c \chi(G^k) \log \chi(G^k). We also provide an upper bound, \chi_{\ell}(G^k)<\chi(G^k)^3 for k>1.
