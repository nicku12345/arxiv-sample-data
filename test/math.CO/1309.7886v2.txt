Mader proved that for every integer t there is a smallest real number c(t) such that any graph with average degree at least c(t) must contain a K_t-minor. Fiorini, Joret, Theis and Wood conjectured that any graph with n vertices and average degree at least c(t)+\epsilon must contain a K_t-minor consisting of at most C(\epsilon,t)\log n vertices. Shapira and Sudakov subsequently proved that such a graph contains a K_t-minor consisting of at most C(\epsilon,t)\log n \log\log n vertices. Here we build on their method using graph expansion to remove the \log\log n factor and prove the conjecture.   Mader also proved that for every integer t there is a smallest real number s(t) such that any graph with average degree larger than s(t) must contain a K_t-topological minor. We prove that, for sufficiently large t, graphs with average degree at least (1+\epsilon)s(t) contain a K_t-topological minor consisting of at most C(\epsilon,t)\log n vertices. Finally, we show that, for sufficiently large t, graphs with average degree at least (1+\epsilon)c(t) contain either a K_t-minor consisting of at most C(\epsilon,t) vertices or a K_t-topological minor consisting of at most C(\epsilon,t)\log n vertices.
