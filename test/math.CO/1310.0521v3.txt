The coefficients of the local h-polynomial of the barycentric subdivision of the simplex with n vertices are known to count derangements in the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_n by the number of excedances. A generalization of this interpretation is given for the local h-polynomial of the rth edgewise subdivision of the barycentric subdivision of the simplex. This polynomial is shown to be \gamma-nonnegative and a combinatorial interpretation to the corresponding \gamma-coefficients is provided. The new combinatorial interpretations involve the notions of flag excedance and descent in the wreath product \ZZ_r \wr \mathfrak{S}_n. A related result on the derangement polynomial for \ZZ_r \wr \mathfrak{S}_n, studied by Chow and Mansour, is also derived from results of Linusson, Shareshian and Wachs on the homology of Rees products of posets.
