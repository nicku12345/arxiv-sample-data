P\'olya's enumeration theorem is concerned with counting labeled sets up to symmetry. Given a finite group acting on a finite set of labeled elements it states that the number of labeled sets up to symmetry is given by a polynomial in the number of labels. We give a new perspective on this theorem by generalizing it to partially ordered sets and order preserving maps. Further we prove a reciprocity statement in terms of strictly order preserving maps generalizing a classical result by Stanley (1970). We apply our results to counting graph colorings up to symmetry.
