The M\"obius (8_4) configuration is generalized in a purely combinatorial approach. We consider (2n_n) configurations {\goth M}_{(n,\varphi)} depending on a permutation \varphi in the symmetric group S_n. Classes of non-isomorphic configurations of this type are determined. The parametric characterization of {\goth M}_{(n,\varphi)} is given. The uniqueness of the decomposition of {\goth M}_{(n,\varphi)} into two mutually inscribed n-simplices is discussed. The automorphisms of {\goth M}_{(n,\varphi)} are characterized for n\geq 3.
