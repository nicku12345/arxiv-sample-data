We introduce fractional realizations of a graph degree sequence and a closely associated convex polytope. Simple graph realizations correspond to a subset of the vertices of this polytope. We describe properties of the polytope vertices and characterize degree sequences for which each polytope vertex corresponds to a simple graph realization. These include the degree sequences of pseudo-split graphs, and we characterize their realizations both in terms of forbidden subgraphs and graph structure.
