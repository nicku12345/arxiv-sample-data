Using cyclotomic classes of order twelve for certain finite fields, we construct an infinite family of almost difference sets and normally regular graphs applying the theory of cyclotomy. We show that in each of these fields neither the multiplicative cyclic subgroup C of index twelve nor C\cup \{0\} forms an almost difference set, but a union of cosets of C provides us an almost difference set. We also calculate the intersection numbers and character tables of cyclotomic association schemes of class two, three and four obtained from these fields.
