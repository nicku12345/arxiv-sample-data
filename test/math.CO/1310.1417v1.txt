Every equivelar abstract polytope of type \{p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\} has at least 2p_1 \cdots p_{n-1} flags. Polytopes that attain this lower bound are called tight. Here we investigate the question of under what conditions there is a tight orientably-regular polytope of type \{p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\}. We show that it is necessary and sufficient that whenever p_i is odd, both p_{i-1} and p_{i+1} are even divisors of 2p_i.
