The graph of overlapping permutations is defined in a way analogous to the De Bruijn graph on strings of symbols. That is, for every permutation \pi = \pi_{1} \pi_{2} ... \pi_{n+1} there is a directed edge from the standardization of \pi_{1} \pi_{2} ... \pi_{n} to the standardization of \pi_{2} \pi_{3} ... \pi_{n+1}. We give a formula for the number of cycles of length d in the subgraph of overlapping 312-avoiding permutations. Using this we also give a refinement of the enumeration of 312-avoiding affine permutations and point out some open problems on this graph, which so far has been little studied.
