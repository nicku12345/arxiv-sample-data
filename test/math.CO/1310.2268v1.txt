For any graph G on n vertices and for any {\em symmetric} subgraph J of K_{n,n}, we construct an infinite sequence of graphs based on the pair (G,J). The First graph in the sequence is G, then at each stage replacing every vertex of the previous graph by a copy of G and every edge of the previous graph by a copy of J the new graph is constructed. We call these graphs {\em self-similar} graphs. We are interested in delineating those pairs (G,J) for which the chromatic numbers of the graphs in the sequence are bounded. Here we have some partial results. When G is a complete graph and J is a special matching we show that every graph in the resulting sequence is an {\em expander} graph.
