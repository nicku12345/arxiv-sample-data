Let r(G,H) be the smallest integer N such that for any 2-coloring (say, red and blue) of the edges of K\_n, n\geqslant N, there is either a red copy of G or a blue copy of H. Let K\_n-K\_{1,s} be the complete graph on n vertices from which the edges of K\_{1,s} are dropped. In this note we present exact values for r(K\_m-K\_{1,1},K\_n-K\_{1,s}) and new upper bounds for r(K\_m,K\_n-K\_{1,s}) in numerous cases. We also present some results for the Ramsey number of Wheels versus K\_n-K\_{1,s}.
