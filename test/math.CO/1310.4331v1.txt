The anti-Ramsey number, AR(n,G), for a graph G and an integer n\geq|V(G)|, is defined to be the minimal integer r such that in any edge-colouring of K_n by at least r colours there is a multicoloured copy of G, namely, a copy of G that each of its edges has a distinct colour. In this paper we determine, for large enough n, AR(n,L\cup tP_2) and AR(n,L\cup kP_3) for any large enough t and k, and a graph L satisfying some conditions. Consequently, we determine AR(n,G), for large enough n, where G is P_3\cup tP_2 for any t\geq 3, P_4\cup tP_2 and C_3\cup tP_2 for any t\geq 2, kP_3 for any k\geq 3, tP_2\cup kP_3 for any t\geq 1, k\geq 2, and P_{t+1}\cup kP_3 for any t\geq 3, k\geq 1. Furthermore, we obtain upper and lower bounds for AR(n,G), for large enough n, where G is P_{k+1}\cup tP_2 and C_k\cup tP_2 for any k\geq 4, t\geq 1.
