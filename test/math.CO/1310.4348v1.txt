We show that for every \varepsilon>0 there is an absolute constant c(\varepsilon)>0 such that the following is true. The union of any n arithmetic progressions, each of length n, with pairwise distinct differences must consist of at least c(\varepsilon)n^{2-\varepsilon} elements. We observe, by construction, that one can find n arithmetic progressions, each of length n, with pairwise distinct differences such that the cardinality of their union is o(n^2). We refer also to the non-symmetric case of n arithmetic progressions, each of length \ell, for various regimes of n and \ell.
