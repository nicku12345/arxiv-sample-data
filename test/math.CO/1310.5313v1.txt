Given a sequence s=(s_1,s_2,\ldots) of positive integers, the inversion sequences with respect to s, or s-inversion sequences, were introduced by Savage and Schuster in their study of lecture hall polytopes. A sequence (e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_n) of nonnegative integers is called an s-inversion sequence of length n if 0\leq e_i < s_i for 1\leq i\leq n. Let I(n) be the set of s-inversion sequences of length n for s=(1,4,3,8,5,12,\ldots), that is, s_{2i}=4i and s_{2i-1}=2i-1 for i\geq1, and let P_n be the set of signed permutations on \{1^2,2^2,\ldots,n^2\}. Savage and Visontai conjectured that when n=2k, the ascent number over I_n is equidistributed with the descent number over P_k. For a positive integer n, we use type B P-partitions to give a characterization of signed permutations over which the descent number is equidistributed with the ascent number over I_n. When n is even, this confirms the conjecture of Savage and Visontai. Moreover, let I'_n be the set of s-inversion sequences of length n for s=(2,2,6,4,10,6,\ldots), that is, s_{2i}=2i and s_{2i-1}=4i-2 for i\geq1. We find a set of signed permutations over which the descent number is equidistributed with the ascent number over I'_n.
