Treewidth is an important and well-known graph parameter that measures the complexity of a graph. The Kneser graph Kneser(n,k) is the graph with vertex set \binom{[n]}{k}, such that two vertices are adjacent if they are disjoint. We determine, for large values of n with respect to k, the exact treewidth of the Kneser graph. In the process of doing so, we also prove a strengthening of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem (for large n with respect to k) when a number of disjoint pairs of k-sets are allowed.
