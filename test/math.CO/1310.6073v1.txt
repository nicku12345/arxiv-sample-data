Using bijections between pattern-avoiding permutations and certain full rook placements on Ferrers boards, we give short proofs of two enumerative results. The first is a simplified enumeration of the 3124, 1234-avoiding permutations, obtained recently by Callan via a complicated decomposition. The second is a streamlined bijection between 1342-avoiding permutations and permutations which can be sorted by two increasing stacks in series, originally due to Atkinson, Murphy, and Ru\v{s}kuc.
