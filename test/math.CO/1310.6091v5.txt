An integer additive set-indexer is defined as an injective function f:V(G)\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0} such that the induced function g_f:E(G) \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0} defined by g_f (uv) = f(u)+ f(v) is also injective, where f(u)+f(v) is the sum set of f(u) and f(v) and \mathbb{N}_0 is the set of all non-negative integers. If g_f(uv)=k \forall uv\in E(G), then f is said to be a k-uniform integer additive set-indexers. An integer additive set-indexer f is said to be a weak integer additive set-indexer if |g_f(uv)|=max(|f(u)|,|f(v)|) \forall uv\in E(G). A weak integer additive set-indexer f is called a weakly k-uniform integer additive set-indexer if g_f(e)=k \forall e\in E(G). We have some characteristics of the graphs which admit weak and weakly uniform integer additive set-indexers. In this paper, we study the admissibility of weak integer additive set-indexer by certain graphs and finite graph operations.
