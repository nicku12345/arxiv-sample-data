Let \mathbb{N}_0 be the set of all non-negative integers. An integer additive set-indexer of a graph G is an injective function f:V(G)\to 2^{\mathbb{N}_0} such that the induced function g_f:E(G) \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0} defined by f^+(uv) = f(u)+ f(v) is also injective. An IASI is said to be {\em k-uniform} if |f^+(e)| = k for all e\in E(G). In this paper, we introduce the notions of strong integer additive set-indexers and initiate a study of the graphs which admit strong integer additive set-indexers.
