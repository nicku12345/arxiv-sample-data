Given a set of n points in R^2, the Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem establishes that the number of lines which can be incident to at least k > 1 of these points is O(n^2/k^3 + n/k). J.\ Solymosi conjectured that if one requires the points to be in a grid formation and the lines to be in general position---no two parallel, no three meeting at a point---then one can get a much tighter bound. We prove: for every \epsilon > 0 there exists some \delta > 0 such that for sufficiently large values of n, every set of lines in general position, each intersecting an n \times n grid of points in at least n^{1-\delta} places, has size at most n^\epsilon.
