Motivated by a conjecture of Savage and Visontai about the equidistribution of the descent statistic on signed permutations of the multiset \{1,1,2,2,\ldots,n,n\} and the ascent statistic on (1,4,3,8,\ldots,2n-1,4n)-inversion sequences, we investigate the descent polynomial of the signed permutations of a general multiset. We obtain a factorial generating function formula for a q-analog of these descent polynomials and apply it to show that they have only real roots. Two different proofs of the conjecture of Savage and Visontai are provided.
