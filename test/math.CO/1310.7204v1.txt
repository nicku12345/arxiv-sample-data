In a projective plane \Pi_q of order q, a non-empty point set {\cal S}_t is a t-semiarc if the number of tangent lines to {\cal S}_t at each of its points is t. If {\cal S}_t is a t-semiarc in \Pi_q, t<q, then each line intersects {\cal S}_t in at most q+1-t points. Dover proved that semiovals (semiarcs with t=1) containing q collinear points exist in \Pi_q only if q<3. We show that if t>1, then t-semiarcs with q+1-t collinear points exist only if t\geq \sqrt{q-1}. In \mathrm{PG}(2,q) we prove the lower bound t\geq(q-1)/2, with equality only if {\cal S}_t is a blocking set of R\'edei type of size 3(q+1)/2.   We call the symmetric difference of two lines, with t further points removed from each line, a V_t-configuration. We give conditions ensuring a t-semiarc to contain a V_t-configuration and give the complete characterization of such t-semiarcs in \mathrm{PG}(2,q).
