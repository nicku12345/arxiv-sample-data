A t-semiarc is a pointset {\cal S}_t with the property that the number of tangent lines to {\cal S}_t at each of its points is t. We show that if a small t-semiarc {\cal S}_t in \mathrm{PG}(2,q) has a large collinear subset {\cal K}, then the tangents to {\cal S}_t at the points of {\cal K} can be blocked by t points not in {\cal K}. We also show that small t-semiarcs are related to certain small blocking sets. Some characterization theorems for small semiarcs with large collinear subsets in \mathrm{PG}(2,q) are given.
