We prove that for n sufficiently large, if A is a family of permutations of \{1,2,\ldots,n\} with no two permutations in \mathcal{A} agreeing exactly once, then |\mathcal{A}| \leq (n-2)!, with equality holding only if \mathcal{A} is a coset of the stabilizer of 2 points. We also obtain a Hilton-Milner type result, namely that if \mathcal{A} is such a family which is not contained within a coset of the stabilizer of 2 points, then it is no larger than the family \{\sigma \in S_{n}:\ \sigma(1)=1,\sigma(2)=2,\ \#\{\textrm{fixed points of}\sigma \geq 5\} \neq 1\} \cup \{(1\ 3)(2\ 4),(1\ 4)(2\ 3),(1\ 3\ 2\ 4),(1\ 4\ 2\ 3)\}.   We conjecture that for t \in \mathbb{N}, and for n sufficiently large depending on t, if \mathcal{A} is family of permutations of \{1,2,\ldots,n\} with no two permutations in \mathcal{A} agreeing exactly t-1 times, then |\mathcal{A}| \leq (n-t)!, with equality holding only if \mathcal{A} is a coset of the stabilizer of t points. This can be seen as a permutation analogue of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s on families of k-element sets with a forbidden intersection, proved by Frankl and F\"uredi in [P. Frankl and Z. F\"uredi, Forbidding Just One Intersection, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, Volume 39 (1985), pp. 160-176].
