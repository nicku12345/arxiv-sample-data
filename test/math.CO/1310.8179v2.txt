We show that a set A \subset \{0,1\}^{n} with edge-boundary of size at most |A| (\log_{2}(2^{n}/|A|) + \epsilon) can be made into a subcube by at most (2 \epsilon/\log_{2}(1/\epsilon))|A| additions and deletions, provided \epsilon is less than an absolute constant.   We deduce that if A \subset \{0,1\}^{n} has size 2^{t} for some t \in \mathbb{N}, and cannot be made into a subcube by fewer than \delta |A| additions and deletions, then its edge-boundary has size at least |A| \log_{2}(2^{n}/|A|) + |A| \delta \log_{2}(1/\delta) = 2^{t}(n-t+\delta \log_{2}(1/\delta)), provided \delta is less than an absolute constant. This is sharp whenever \delta = 1/2^{j} for some j \in \{1,2,\ldots,t\}.
