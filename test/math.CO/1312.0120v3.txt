This article is devoted to the computation of Jack connection coefficients, a generalization of the connection coefficients of two classical commutative subalgebras of the group algebra of the symmetric group: the class algebra and the double coset algebra. The connection coefficients of these two algebraic structures are of significant interest in the study of Schur and zonal polynomials as well as the irreducible characters of the symmetric group and the zonal spherical functions. Furthermore they play an important role in combinatorics as they give the number of factorizations of a permutation into a product of permutations with given cyclic properties. Usually studied separately, these two families of coefficients share strong similar properties. First (partially) introduced by Goulden and Jackson in 1996, Jack connection coefficients provide a natural unified approach closely related to the theory of Jack polynomials, a family of bases in the ring of symmetric functions indexed by a parameter \alpha that generalizes both Schur (case \alpha = 1) and zonal polynomials (case \alpha = 2). Jack connection coefficients are also directly linked to Jack characters, a general view of the characters of the symmetric group and the zonal spherical functions. Goulden and Jackson conjectured that these coefficients are polynomials in \alpha with nice combinatorial properties, the so-called Matchings-Jack conjecture. In this paper, we use the theory of Jack symmetric functions and the Laplace Beltrami operator to show the polynomial properties of Jack connection coefficients in some important cases. We also provide explicit formulations including notably a generalization of a classical formula of D\'enes for the number of minimal factorizations of a permutation into transpositions.
