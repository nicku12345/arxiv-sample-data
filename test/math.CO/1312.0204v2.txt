For a given simple graph G, the energy of G, denoted by \mathcal {E}(G), is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix, which was defined by I. Gutman. The problem on determining the maximal energy tends to be complicated for a given class of graphs. There are many approaches on the maximal energy of trees, unicyclic graphs and bicyclic graphs, respectively. Let P^{6,6,6}_n denote the graph with n\geq 20 vertices obtained from three copies of C_6 and a path P_{n-18} by adding a single edge between each of two copies of C_6 to one endpoint of the path and a single edge from the third C_6 to the other endpoint of the P_{n-18}. Very recently, Aouchiche et al. [M. Aouchiche, G. Caporossi, P. Hansen, Open problems on graph eigenvalues studied with AutoGraphiX, {\it Europ. J. Comput. Optim.} {\bf 1}(2013), 181--199] put forward the following conjecture: Let G be a tricyclic graphs on n vertices with n=20 or n\geq22, then \mathcal{E}(G)\leq \mathcal{E}(P_{n}^{6,6,6}) with equality if and only if G\cong P_{n}^{6,6,6}. Let G(n;a,b,k) denote the set of all connected bipartite tricyclic graphs on n vertices with three vertex-disjoint cycles C_{a}, C_{b} and C_{k}, where n\geq 20. In this paper, we try to prove that the conjecture is true for graphs in the class G\in G(n;a,b,k), but as a consequence we can only show that this is true for most of the graphs in the class except for 9 families of such graphs.
