One of the most basic results in graph theory states that every graph with at least two vertices has two vertices with the same degree. Since there are graphs without 3 vertices of the same degree, it is natural to ask if for any fixed k, every graph G is ``close'' to a graph G' with k vertices of the same degree. Our main result in this paper is that this is indeed the case. Specifically, we show that for any positive integer k, there is a constant C=C(k), so that given any graph G, one can remove from G at most C vertices and thus obtain a new graph G' that contains at least \min\{k,|G|-C\} vertices of the same degree.   Our main tool is a multidimensional zero-sum theorem for integer sequences, which we prove using an old geometric approach of Alon and Berman.
