We present a different way to obtain generators of metric spaces having the property that the ``position'' of every element of the space is uniquely determined by the distances from the elements of the generators. Specifically we introduce a generator based on a partition of the metric space into sets of elements. The sets of the partition will work as the new elements which will uniquely determine the position of each single element of the space. A set W of vertices of a connected graph G strongly resolves two different vertices x,y\notin W if either d_G(x,W)=d_G(x,y)+d_G(y,W) or d_G(y,W)=d_G(y,x)+d_G(x,W), where d_G(x,W)=\min\left\{d(x,w)\;:\;w\in W\right\}. An ordered vertex partition \Pi=\left\{U_1,U_2,...,U_k\right\} of a graph G is a strong resolving partition for G if every two different vertices of G belonging to the same set of the partition are strongly resolved by some set of \Pi. A strong resolving partition of minimum cardinality is called a strong partition basis and its cardinality the strong partition dimension. In this article we introduce the concepts of strong resolving partition and strong partition dimension and we begin with the study of its mathematical properties. We give some realizability results for this parameter and we also obtain tight bounds and closed formulae for the strong metric dimension of several graphs.
