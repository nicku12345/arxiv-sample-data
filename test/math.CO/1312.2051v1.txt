We give an explicit formula for the number of permutations avoiding cyclically a consecutive pattern in terms of the spectrum of the associated operator of the consecutive pattern. As an example, the number of cyclically consecutive 123-avoiding permutations in {\mathfrak S}_{n} is given by n! times the convergent series {\displaystyle \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2\pi(k+1/3)}\right)^{n}} for n \geq 2.
