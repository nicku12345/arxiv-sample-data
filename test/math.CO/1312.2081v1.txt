Let G_1 and G_2 be two given graphs. The Ramsey number R(G_1,G_2) is the least integer r such that for every graph G on r vertices, either G contains a G_1 or \overline{G} contains a G_2. We denote by P_n the path on n vertices and W_m the wheel on m+1 vertices. Chen et al. and Zhang determined the values of R(P_n,W_m) when m\leq n+1 and when n+2\leq m\leq 2n, respectively. In this paper we determine all the values of R(P_n,W_m) for the left case m\geq 2n+1. Together with Chen et al's and Zhang's results, we give a complete solution to the problem of determining the Ramsey numbers of paths versus wheels.
