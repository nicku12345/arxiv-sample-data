Let S_n denote the symmetric group on \{1,2,\ldots,n\}. For two permutations u, v\in S_n such that u\leq v in the Bruhat order, let R_{u,v}(q) and \R_{u,v}(q) denote the Kazhdan-Lusztig R-polynomial and \R-polynomial, respectively. Let v_n=34\cdots n\, 12, and let \sigma be a permutation such that \sigma\leq v_n. We obtain a formula for the \R-polynomials \R_{\sigma,v_n}(q) in terms of the q-Fibonacci numbers depending on a parameter determined by the reduced expression of \sigma. When \sigma is the identity e, this reduces to a formula obtained by Pagliacci. In another direction, we obtain a formula for the \R-polynomial \R_{e,\,v_{n,i}}(q), where v_{n,i} = 3 4\cdots i\,n\, (i+1)\cdots (n-1)\, 12. In a more general context, we conjecture that for any two permutations \sigma,\tau\in S_n such that \sigma\leq \tau\leq v_n, the \R-polynomial \R_{\sigma,\tau}(q) can be expressed as a product of q-Fibonacci numbers multiplied by a power of q.
