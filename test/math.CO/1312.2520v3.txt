In this article we introduce the m-cover poset of an arbitrary bounded poset \mathcal{P}, which is a certain subposet of the m-fold direct product of \mathcal{P} with itself. Its ground set consists of multichains of \mathcal{P} that contain at most three different elements, one of which has to be the least element of \mathcal{P}, and the other two elements have to form a cover relation in \mathcal{P}. We study the m-cover poset from a structural and topological point of view. In particular, we characterize the posets whose m-cover poset is a lattice for all m>0, and we characterize the special cases, where these lattices are EL-shellable, left-modular, or trim. Subsequently, we investigate the m-cover poset of the Tamari lattice \mathcal{T}_{n}, and we show that the smallest lattice that contains the m-cover poset of \mathcal{T}_{n} is isomorphic to the m-Tamari lattice \mathcal{T}_{n}^{(m)} introduced by Bergeron and Pr\'eville-Ratelle. We conclude this article with a conjectural desription of an explicit realization of \mathcal{T}_{n}^{(m)} in terms of m-tuples of Dyck paths.
