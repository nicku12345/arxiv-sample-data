For a graph G of order n and with eigenvalues \lambda_1\geqslant\cdots\geqslant\lambda_n, the HL-index R(G) is defined as R(G) ={\max}\left\{|\lambda_{\lfloor(n+1)/2\rfloor}|, |\lambda_{\lceil(n+1)/2\rceil}|\right\}. We show that for every connected bipartite graph G with maximum degree \Delta\geqslant3, R(G)\leqslant\sqrt{\Delta-2} unless G is the the incidence graph of a projective plane of order \Delta-1. We also present an approach through graph covering to construct infinite families of bipartite graphs with large HL-index.
