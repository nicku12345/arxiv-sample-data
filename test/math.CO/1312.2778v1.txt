An automorphism of a graph G=(V,E) is a bijective map \phi from V to itself such that \phi(v_i)\phi(v_j)\in E \Leftrightarrow v_i v_j\in E for any two vertices v_i and v_j. Denote by \mathfrak{G} the group consisting of all automorphisms of G. Apparently, an automorphism of G can be regarded as a permutation on [n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}, provided that G has n vertices. For each permutation \sigma on [n], there is a natural action on any given vector \boldsymbol{u}=(u_1,\ldots,u_n)^t\in \mathbb{C}^n such that \sigma\boldsymbol{u}=(u_{\sigma^{-1}1},u_{\sigma^{-1}2},\ldots,u_{\sigma^{-1} n})^t, so \sigma can be viewed as a linear operator on \mathbb{C}^n. Accordingly, one can formulate a characterization to the automorphisms of G, {\it i.e.,} \sigma is an automorphism of G if and only if every eigenspace of \mathbf{A}(G) is \sigma-invariant, where \mathbf{A}(G) is the adjacency matrix of G. Consequently, every eigenspace of \mathbf{A}(G) is \mathfrak{G}-invariant, which is equivalent to that for any eigenvector \boldsymbol{v} of \mathbf{A}(G) corresponding to the eigenvalue \lambda, \mathrm{span}(\mathfrak{G}\boldsymbol{v}) is a subspace of the eigenspace V_{\lambda}. By virtue of the linear representation of the automorphism group \mathfrak{G}, we characterize those extremal vectors \boldsymbol{v} in an eigenspace of \mathbf{A}(G) so that \mathrm{dim}~\mathrm{span}(\mathfrak{G}\boldsymbol{v}) can attain extremal values, and furthermore, we determine the exact value of \mathrm{dim}~\mathrm{span}(\mathfrak{G}\boldsymbol{v}) for any eigenvector \boldsymbol{v} of \mathbf{A}(G).
