We say that a set A \emph{t-intersects} a set B if A and B have at least t common elements. Two families \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} are said to be \emph{cross-t-intersecting} if each set in \mathcal{A} t-intersects each set in \mathcal{B}. For any positive integers n and r, let {[n] \choose r} denote the family of all r-element subsets of \{1,2,\dots, n\}. We show that for any integers r, s and t with 1 \leq t \leq r \leq s, there exists an integer n_0(r,s,t) such that for any integer n \geq n_0(r,s,t), if \mathcal{A} \subset {[n] \choose r} and \mathcal{B} \subset {[n] \choose s} such that \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B} are cross-t-intersecting, then |\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}| \leq {n-t \choose r-t}{n-t \choose s-t}, and equality holds if and only if for some T \in {[n] \choose t}, \mathcal{A} = \{A \in {[n] \choose r} \colon T \subset A\} and \mathcal{B} = \{B \in {[n] \choose s} \colon T \subset B\}. This verifies a conjecture of Hirschorn.
