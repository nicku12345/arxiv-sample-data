We present here some new identities for generalizations of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers by combinatorially interpreting these numbers in terms of numbers of certain tilings of a 1 \times m board. As a consequence, some new interesting identities involving the ordinaries Fibonacci and Lucas numbers are derived.
