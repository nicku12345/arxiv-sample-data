We introduce the M\"obius polynomial  M_n(x) = \sum_{d|n} \mu\left( \frac nd \right) x^d , which gives the number of aperiodic bracelets of length n with x possible types of gems, and therefore satisfies M_n(x) \equiv 0 (mod n) for all x \in \mathbb Z. We derive some key properties, analyze graphs in the complex plane, and then apply M\"obius polynomials combinatorially to juggling patterns, irreducible polynomials over finite fields, and Euler's totient theorem.
