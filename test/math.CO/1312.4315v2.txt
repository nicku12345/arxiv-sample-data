The main result of this paper is the construction of a bijection of the set of words in so-called standard order of length n formed by four different letters and the set \mathbb{N}^n of all subspaces of a fixed n-dimensional maximal isotropic subspace of the 2n-dimensional symplectic space V over \mathbb{F}_2 which are not maximal in a certain sense. Since the number of different words in standard order is known, this gives an alternative proof for the formula of the dimension of the universal embedding of a symplectic dual polar space \mathcal G_n. Along the way, we give formulas for the number of all n- and (n-1)-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces of V.
