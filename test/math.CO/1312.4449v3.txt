The \gamma-Cambrian semilattices \mathcal{C}_{\gamma} defined by Reading and Speyer are a family of meet-semilattices associated with a Coxeter group W and a Coxeter element \gamma\in W, and they are lattices if and only if W is finite. In the case where W is the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_{n} and \gamma is the long cycle (1\;2\;\ldots\;n) the corresponding \gamma-Cambrian lattice is isomorphic to the well-known Tamari lattice \mathcal{T}_{n}. Recently, Kallipoliti and the author have investigated \mathcal{C}_{\gamma} from a topological viewpoint, and showed that many properties of the Tamari lattices can be generalized nicely. In the present article this investigation is continued on a structural level using the observation of Reading and Speyer that \mathcal{C}_{\gamma} is semidistributive. First we prove that every closed interval of \mathcal{C}_{\gamma} is a bounded-homomorphic image of a free lattice (in fact it is a so-called \mathcal{H\!H}-lattice). Subsequently we prove that each closed interval of \mathcal{C}_{\gamma} is trim, we determine its breadth, and we characterize the closed intervals that are dismantlable.
