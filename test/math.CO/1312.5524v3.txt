In [9], Terao proved the freeness of multi-Coxeter arrangements with constant multiplicities by giving an explicit construction of bases. Combining it with algebro-geometric method, Yoshinaga proved the freeness of the extended Catalan and Shi arrangements in [11]. However, there have been no explicit constructions of the bases for the logarithmic derivation modules of the extended Catalan and Shi arrangements. In this paper, we give the first explicit construction of them when the root system is of the type A_2.
