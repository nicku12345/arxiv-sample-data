Let \Gamma=\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle be a numerical semigroup. In this article we consider the dual \Delta^* of a \Gamma-semimodule \Delta; in particular we deduce a formula that expresses the minimal set of generators of \Delta^* in terms of the generators of \Delta. As applications we compute the minimal graded free resolution of a graded \mathbb{F}[t^{\alpha},t^{\beta}]-submodule of \mathbb{F}[t], and we investigate the structure of the selfdual \Gamma-semimodules, leading to a new way of counting them.
