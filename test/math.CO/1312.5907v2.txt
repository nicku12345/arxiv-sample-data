We consider well-quasi-order for classes of permutation graphs which omit both a path and a clique. Our principle result is that the class of permutation graphs omitting P_5 and a clique of any size is well-quasi-ordered. This is proved by giving a structural decomposition of the corresponding permutations. We also exhibit three infinite antichains to show that the classes of permutation graphs omitting \{P_6,K_6\}, \{P_7,K_5\}, and \{P_8,K_4\} are not well-quasi-ordered.
