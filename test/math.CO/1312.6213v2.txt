Mader conjectured that every C_4-free graph has a subdivision of a clique of order linear in its average degree. We show that every C_6-free graph has such a subdivision of a large clique.   We also prove the dense case of Mader's conjecture in a stronger sense, i.e. for every c, there is a c' such that every C_4-free graph with average degree cn^{1/2} has a subdivision of a clique K_\ell with \ell=\lfloor c'n^{1/2}\rfloor where every edge is subdivided exactly 3 times.
