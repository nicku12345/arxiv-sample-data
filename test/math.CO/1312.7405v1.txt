For an arbitrary set of distances D\subseteq \{0,1, \ldots, diam(G)\}, a D-weight of a vertex x in a graph G under a vertex labeling f:V\rightarrow \{1,2, \ldots , v\} is defined as w_D(x)=\sum_{y\in N_D(x)} f(y), where N_D(x) = \{y \in V| d(x,y) \in D\}. A graph G is said to be D-distance magic if all vertices has the same D-vertex-weight, it is said to be D-distance antimagic if all vertices have distinct D-vertex-weights, and it is called (a,d)-D-distance antimagic if the D-vertex-weights constitute an arithmetic progression with difference d and starting value a.   In this paper we study some necessary conditions for the existence of D-distance antimagic graphs. We conjecture that such conditions are also sufficient. Additionally, we study \{1\}-distance antimagic labelings for some cycle-related connected graphs: cycles, suns, prisms, complete graphs, wheels, fans, and friendship graphs.
