The bondage number b(G) of a graph G is the cardinality of a minimum edge set whose removal from G results in a graph with the domination number greater than that of G. It is a parameter to measure the vulnerability of a communication network under link failure. In this paper, we obtain the exact value of the bondage number of the strong product of a complete graph and a path. That is, for any two integers m\geq1 and n\geq2, b(K_{m}\boxtimes P_{n})=\lceil\frac{m}{2}\rceil if n\equiv 0 (mod 3); m if n\equiv 2 (mod 3); \lceil\frac{3m}{2}\rceil if n\equiv 1 (mod 3). Furthermore, we determine the exact value of the bondage number of the strong product of a complete graph and a special starlike tree.
