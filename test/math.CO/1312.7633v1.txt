For an arbitrary set of distances D\subseteq \{0,1, \ldots, d\}, a graph G is said to be D-distance magic if there exists a bijection f:V\rightarrow \{1,2, \ldots , v\} and a constant {\sf k} such that for any vertex x, \sum_{y\in N_D(x)} f(y) ={\sf k}, where N_D(x) = \{y \in V| d(x,y) \in D\}.   In this paper we study some necessary or sufficient conditions for the existence of D-distance magic graphs, some of which are generalization of conditions for the existence of \{1\}-distance magic graphs. More specifically, we study D-distance magic labelings for cycles and D-distance magic graphs for D\subseteq\{0,1,2\}.
