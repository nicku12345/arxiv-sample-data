A set-indexer of a graph G is an injective set-valued function f:V(G) \rightarrow2^{X} such that the function f^{\oplus}:E(G)\rightarrow2^{X}-\{\emptyset\} defined by f^{\oplus}(uv) = f(u){\oplus} f(v) for every uv{\in} E(G) is also injective, where 2^{X} is the set of all subsets of X and \oplus is the symmetric difference of sets. An integer additive set-indexer is defined as an injective function f:V(G)\rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0} such that the induced function g_f:E(G) \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb{N}_0} defined by g_f (uv) = f(u)+ f(v) is also injective. A graph G which admits an IASI is called an IASI graph. An IASI f is said to be a {\em weak IASI} if |g_f(uv)|=max(|f(u)|,|f(v)|) and an IASI f is said to be a {\em strong IASI} if |g_f(uv)|=|f(u)| |f(v)| for all u,v\in V(G). In this paper, we study about certain characteristics of inter additive set-indexers.
