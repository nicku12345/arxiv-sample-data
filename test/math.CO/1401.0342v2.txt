Given a connected graph G=(V,E), a set S\subseteq V is a k-metric generator for G if for any two different vertices u,v\in V, there exist at least k vertices w_1,...,w_k\in S such that d_G(u,w_i)\ne d_G(v,w_i) for every i\in \{1,...,k\}. A metric generator of minimum cardinality is called a k-metric basis and its cardinality the k-metric dimension of G. We study some problems regarding the complexity of some k-metric dimension problems. For instance, we show that the problem of computing the k-metric dimension of graphs is NP-Complete. However, the problem is solved in linear time for the particular case of trees.
