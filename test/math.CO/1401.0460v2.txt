In this paper, we prove an analogue of Corr\'adi and Hajnal's classical theorem. There exists n_0 such that for every n \in 3\mathbb{Z} when n \ge n_0 the following holds. If G is an oriented graph on n vertices and every vertex has both indegree and outdegree at least 7n/18, then G contains a perfect transitive triangle tiling, which is a collection of vertex-disjoint transitive triangles covering every vertex of G. This result is best possible, as, for every n \in 3\mathbb{Z}, there exists an oriented graph G on n vertices without a perfect transitive triangle tiling in which every vertex has both indegree and outdegree at least \lceil 7n/18\rceil - 1.
