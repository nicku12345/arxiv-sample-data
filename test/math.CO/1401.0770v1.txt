Guibert and Linusson introduced the family of doubly alternating Baxter permutations, i.e. Baxter permutations \sigma \in S_n, such that \sigma and \sigma^{-1} are alternating. They proved that the number of such permutations in S_{2n} and S_{2n+1} is the Catalan number C_n. In this paper we explore the expected limit shape of such permutations, following the approach by Miner and Pak.
