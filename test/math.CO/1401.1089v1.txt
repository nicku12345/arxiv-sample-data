I describe an empirical-yet-rigorous, algorithm, based on Riordan's rook polynomials and the so-called C-finite ansatz, fully implemented in the accompanying Maple package (http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/MENAGES ), MENAGES, that reproduces in a few seconds, rigorously-proved enumeration theorems on permutations with restricted positions, previously proved by quite a few illustrious human mathematicians, and that can go far beyond any human attempts.
