Let G be a simple graph of order n. The domination polynomial of G is the polynomial D(G, x)=\sum_{i=\gamma(G)}^{n} d(G,i) x^{i}, where d(G,i) is the number of dominating sets of G of size i and \gamma(G) is the domination number of G. It is conjectured that the domination polynomial of any graph is unimodal. In this paper we present some families of graphs whose domination polynomials are unimodal.
