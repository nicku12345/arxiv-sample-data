Primary Cyclic matrices were used (but not named) by Holt and Rees in their version of Parker's MEAT-AXE algorithm to test irreducibility of finite matrix groups and algebras. They are matrices X with at least one cyclic component in the primary decomposition of the underlying vector space as an X-module. Let \operatorname{M}(c,q^b) be an irreducible subalgebra of \operatorname{M}(n,q), where n=bc >c. We prove a generalisation of the Kung-Stong Cycle Index, and use it to obtain a lower bound for the proportion of primary cyclic matrices in \operatorname{M}(c,q^b). This extends work of Glasby and the second author on the case b=1.
