We prove a conjecture of Knutson asserting that the Schubert structure constants of the cohomology ring of a two-step flag variety are equal to the number of puzzles with specified border labels that can be created using a list of eight puzzle pieces. As a consequence, we obtain a puzzle formula for the Gromov-Witten invariants defining the small quantum cohomology ring of a Grassmann variety of type A. The proof of the conjecture proceeds by showing that the puzzle formula defines an associative product on the cohomology ring of the two-step flag variety. It is based on an explicit bijection of gashed puzzles that is analogous to the jeu de taquin algorithm but more complicated.
