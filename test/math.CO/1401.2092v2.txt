Let G be a simple graph of order n. The {\em domination polynomial} of G is the polynomial {D(G, x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} d(G,i) x^{i}}, where d(G,i) is the number of dominating sets of G of size i.   Let n be any positive integer and F_n be the Friendship graph with 2n + 1 vertices and 3n edges, formed by the join of K_{1} with nK_{2}. We study the domination polynomials of this family of graphs, and in particular examine the domination roots of the family, and find the limiting curve for the roots. We also show that for every n\geq 2, F_n is not \mathcal{D}-unique, that is, there is another non-isomorphic graph with the same domination polynomial. Also we construct some families of graphs whose real domination roots are only -2 and 0. Finally, we conclude by discussing the domination polynomials of a related family of graphs, the n-book graphs B_n, formed by joining n copies of the cycle graph C_4 with a common edge.
