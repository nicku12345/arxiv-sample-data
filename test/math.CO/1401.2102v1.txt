Given a k\times l (0,1)-matrix F, we denote by \mathrm{fs}(m,F) the largest number for which there is an m \times \mathrm{fs}(m,F) (0,1)-matrix with no repeated columns and no induced submatrix equal to F. A conjecture of Anstee, Frankl, F\"{u}redi and Pach states that \mathrm{fs}(m,F) = O(m^k) for a fixed matrix F. The main results of this paper are that \mathrm{fs}(m,F) = m^{2+ o(1)} if k=2 and that \mathrm{fs}(m,F) = m^{5k/3 -1 + o(1)} if k\geq 3.
