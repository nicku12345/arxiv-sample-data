The generalized k-edge-connectivity \lambda_k(G) of a graph G is a generalization of the concept of edge-connectivity. The lexicographic product of two graphs G and H, denoted by G\circ H, is an important graph product. In this paper, we mainly study the generalized 3-edge-connectivity of G \circ H, and get upper and lower bounds of \lambda_3(G \circ H). Moreover, all bounds are sharp.
