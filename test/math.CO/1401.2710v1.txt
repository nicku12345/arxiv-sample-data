For k\mid n let Comb_{n,k} denote the tree consisting of an (n/k)-vertex path with disjoint k-vertex paths beginning at each of its vertices. An old conjecture says that for any k=k(n) the threshold for the random graph G(n,p) to contain Comb_{n,k} is at p\asymp \frac{\log n}n. Here we verify this for k \leq C\log n with any fixed C>0. In a companion paper, using very different methods, we treat the complementary range, proving the conjecture for k\geq \kappa_0 \log n (with \kappa_0\approx 4.82).
