Given positive integers n and k, a k-term semi-progression of scope m is a sequence (x_1,x_2,...,x_k) such that x_{j+1} - x_j \in \{d,2d,\ldots,md\}, 1 \le j \le k-1, for some positive integer d. Thus an arithmetic progression is a semi-progression of scope 1. Let S_m(k) denote the least integer for which every coloring of \{1,2,...,S_m(k)\} yields a monochromatic k-term semi-progression of scope m. We obtain an exponential lower bound on S_m(k) for all m=O(1). Our approach also yields a marginal improvement on the best known lower bound for the analogous Ramsey function for quasi-progressions, which are sequences whose successive differences lie in a small interval.
