The domination polynomial of a graph G of order n is the polynomial D(G,x)=\sum_{i=\gamma(G)}^{n} d(G,i) x^{i}, where d(G,i) is the number of dominating sets of G of size i, and \gamma(G) is the domination number of G. The roots of domination polynomial is called domination roots. In this article, we compute the domination polynomial and domination roots of all graphs of order less than or equal to 6, and show them in the tables.
