We show that the homotopy category of complexes K(B) over any finitely accessible additive category B is locally well generated. That is, any localizing subcategory L in K(B) which is generated by a set is well generated in the sense of Neeman. We also show that K(B) itself being well generated is equivalent to B being pure semisimple, a concept which naturally generalizes right pure semisimplicity of a ring R for B = Mod-R.
