Let R be an isolated Gorenstein singularity with a non-commutative resolution A=End_R(R\oplus M). In this paper, we show that the relative singularity category \Delta_R(A) of A has a number of pleasant properties, such as being Hom-finite. Moreover, it determines the classical singularity category D_{sg}(R) of Buchweitz and Orlov as a certain canonical quotient category. If R has finite CM type, which includes for example Kleinian singularities, then we show the much more surprising result that D_{sg}(R) determines \Delta_R(Aus(R)), where Aus(R) is the corresponding Auslander algebra. The proofs of these results use dg algebras, A_\infty Koszul duality, and the new concept of dg Auslander algebras, which may be of independent interest.
