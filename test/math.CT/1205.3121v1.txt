We give algebraic equivalents for certain desirable properties of pullback functors on categories of coverings and group sets, namely nullity zero, essential injectivity, and essential surjectivity. Nullity zero turns out to be equivalent to the notion of a contranormal subgroup. We observe a Tannakian-like phenomenon with essential injectivity. Essential surjectivity is intimately related to Zappa-Sz{\'e}p products. We include several examples, and some open questions.
