We prove non-commutative reciprocity laws on an algebraic surface defined over a perfect field. These reciprocity laws claim the splittings of some central extensions of globally constructed groups over some subgroups constructed by points or projective curves on a surface. For a two-dimensional local field with a finite last residue field the constructed local central extension is isomorphic to a central extension which comes from the case of tame ramification of the Abelian two-dimensional local Langlands correspondence suggested by M. Kapranov.
