A categorification of the Heisenberg algebra is constructed in by Khovanov using graphical calculus, and left with a conjecture on the isomorphism between the Heisenberg algebra and Grothendieck ring of the constructed category. We give a proof of Khovanov's conjectured statement in this paper from a categorification of some deformed Heisenberg algebra.
