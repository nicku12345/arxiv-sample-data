For a given stability condition \sigma on a triangulated category we define a \sigma-exceptional collection as an Ext-exceptional collection, whose elements are \sigma-semistable with phases contained in an open interval of length one. If there exists a full \sigma-exceptional collection, then \sigma is generated by this collection in a procedure described by E. Macr\`i.   Constructing \sigma-exceptional collections of length at least three in D^b(\mathcal A) from a non-semistable exceptional object, where \mathcal A is a hereditary hom-finite abelian category, we introduce certain conditions on the Ext-nontrivial couples (couples of exceptional objects X,Y\in \mathcal A with {\rm Ext}^1(X,Y)\neq 0 and {\rm Ext}^1(Y,X)\neq 0).   After a detailed study of the exceptional objects of two tame quivers Q_1 and Q_2 with three and four vertices, respectively, we observe that the needed conditions do hold in Rep_k(Q_1), Rep_k(Q_2), where k is an algebraically closed field.   Combining these findings, we prove that for each \sigma\in {\rm Stab}(D^b(Q_1)) there exists a full \sigma-exceptional collection. It follows that {\rm Stab}(D^b(Q_1)) is connected.
