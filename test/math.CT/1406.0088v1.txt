The author has previously associated to each commutative ring with unit \Bbbk and \'etale groupoid \mathscr G with locally compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected unit space a \Bbbk-algebra \Bbbk\mathscr G. The algebra \Bbbk\mathscr G need not be unital, but it always has local units. The class of groupoid algebras includes group algebras, inverse semigroup algebras and Leavitt path algebras. In this paper we show that the category of unitary \Bbbk\mathscr G-modules is equivalent to the category of sheaves of \Bbbk-modules over \mathscr G. As a consequence we obtain a new proof of a recent result that Morita equivalent groupoids have Morita equivalent algebras.
