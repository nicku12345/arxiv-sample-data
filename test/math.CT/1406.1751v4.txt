In paper arXiv:1406.1744, we constructed a symmetric monoidal category LIE^{MC} whose objects are shifted (and filtered) L-infinity algebras. Here, we fix a cooperad C and show that algebras over the operad Cobar(C) naturally form a category enriched over LIE^{MC}. Following arXiv:1406.1744, we "integrate" this LIE^{MC}-enriched category to a simplicial category HoAlg^{\Delta}_C whose mapping spaces are Kan complexes. The simplicial category HoAlg^{\Delta}_C gives us a particularly nice model of an (\infty,1)-category of Cobar(C)-algebras. We show that the homotopy category of HoAlg^{\Delta}_C is the localization of the category of Cobar(C)-algebras and infinity morphisms with respect to infinity quasi-isomorphisms. Finally, we show that the Homotopy Transfer Theorem is a simple consequence of the Goldman-Millson theorem.
