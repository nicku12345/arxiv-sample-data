Let A be an \mathbf{E}_{\infty}-ring spectrum over the rational numbers. If A satisfies a noetherian condition on its homotopy groups \pi_*(A), we construct a collection of \mathbf{E}_{\infty}-A-algebras that realize on homotopy the residue fields of \pi_*(A). We prove an analog of the nilpotence theorem for these residue fields. As a result, we are able to give a complete algebraic description of the Galois theory of A and of the thick subcategories of perfect A-modules. We also obtain partial information on the Picard group of A.
