Let \mathscr{M} be a combinatorial and left proper model category, possibly with a monoidal structure. If \mathscr{O} is either a monad on \mathscr{M} or an operad enriched over \mathscr{M}, define a QS-algebra in \mathscr{M} to be a weak equivalence \mathscr{F}: s(\mathscr{F}) \xrightarrow{\sim}t(\mathscr{F}) such that the target t(\mathscr{F}) is an \mathscr{O}-algebra in the usual sense. A classical \mathscr{O}-algebra is a QS-algebra supported by an isomorphism \mathscr{F}. A QS-structure \mathscr{F} is also a weak equivalence such that t(\mathscr{F}) has a structure, e.g, Hodge, twistorial, schematic, sheaf, etc. We build a homotopy theory of these objects and compare it with that of usual \mathscr{O}-algebras/structures. Our results rely on Smith's theorem on left Bousfield localization for combinatorial and left proper model categories. These ideas are derived from the theory of co-Segal algebras and categories.
