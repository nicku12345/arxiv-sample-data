We will study commuting properties of the defect functor \mathrm{Dev}_\beta=\mathrm{Coker}\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(\beta,-) associate to a homomorphism \beta in a finitely presented category. As an application, we characterize objects M such that \mathrm{Ext}^1_\mathcal{C}(M,-) commutes with direct unions (i.e. direct limits of monomorphisms), assuming that \mathcal{C} has a generator which is a direct sum of finitely presented projective objects.
