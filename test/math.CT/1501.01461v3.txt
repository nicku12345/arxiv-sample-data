Let \overline\F\_p be the algebraic closure of the prime field of characteristic p. After observing that the principal block B of \overline\F\_pPSU(3,p^r) is stably equivalent of Morita type to its Brauer correspondent b, we show however that the centre of B is not isomorphic as an algebra to the centre of b in the cases p^r\in\{3,4,5,8\}. As a consequence, the algebra B\otimes\_{\overline{\F}\_p}\overline \F\_p[X]/X^p is not stably equivalent of Morita type to b\otimes\_{\overline\F\_p}\overline\F\_p[X]/X^p in these cases. This yields a negative answer to a question of Rickard.
