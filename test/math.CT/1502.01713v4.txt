We show that conically smooth stratified spaces embed fully faithfully into \infty-categories. This articulates a stratified generalization of the homotopy hypothesis proposed by Grothendieck. As such, each \infty-category defines a stack on conically smooth stratified spaces, and we identify the descent conditions it satisfies. These include \mathbb{R}^1-invariance and descent for open covers and blow-ups, analogous to sheaves for the h-topology in \mathbb{A}^1-homotopy theory. In this way, we identify \infty-categories as striation sheaves, which are those sheaves on conically smooth stratified spaces satisfying the indicated descent. We use this identification to construct by hand two remarkable examples of \infty-categories: \mathcal{B}{\sf un}, an \infty-category classifying constructible bundles; and \mathcal{E}{\sf xit}, the absolute exit-path \infty-category. These constructions are deeply premised on stratified geometry, the key geometric input being a characterization of conically smooth stratified maps between cones and the existence of pullbacks for constructible bundles.
