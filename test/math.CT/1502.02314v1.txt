We consider a subclass of the class of group-theoretical fusion categories: To every finite group G and subgroup H one can associate the category of G-graded vector spaces with a two-sided H-action compatible with the grading. We derive a formula that computes higher Frobenius-Schur indicators for the objects in such a category using the combinatorics and representation theory of the groups involved in their construction. We calculate some explicit examples for inclusions of symmetric groups.
