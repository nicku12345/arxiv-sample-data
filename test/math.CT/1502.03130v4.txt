The purpose of this article is to prove that the category of cocommutative Hopf K-algebras, over a field K of characteristic zero, is a semi-abelian category. Moreover, we show that this category is action representable, and that it contains a torsion theory whose torsion-free and torsion parts are given by the category of groups and by the category of Lie K-algebras, respectively.
