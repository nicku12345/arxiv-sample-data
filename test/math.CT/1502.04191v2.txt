To 2-categorify the theory of group representations, we introduce the notions of the 3-representation of a group in a strict 3-category and the strict 2-categorical action of a group on a strict 2-category. We also 2-categorify the concept of the trace by introducing the 2-categorical trace of a 1-endomorphism in a strict 3-category. For a 3-representation \rho of a group G and an element f of G, the 2-categorical trace \mathbb{T}r_2 \rho_f  is a category. Moreover, the centralizer of f in G acts categorically on this 2-categorical trace. We construct the induced strict 2-categorical action of a finite group, and show that the 2-categorical trace  \mathbb{T}r_2 takes an induced strict 2-categorical action into an induced categorical action of the initia groupoid. As a corollary, we get the 3-character formula of the induced strict 2-categorical action.
