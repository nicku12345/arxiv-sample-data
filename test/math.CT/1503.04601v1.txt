In this paper we prove an analogue of Brauer's theorem for faithful objects in fusion categories. Other notions, such as the order and the index associated to faithful objects of fusion categories are also discussed. We show that the index of a faithful simple object of a fusion categories coincides with the order of the universal grading group of the fusion category.
