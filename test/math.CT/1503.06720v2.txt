We provide a very general approach to placing model structures and semi-model structures on algebras over symmetric colored operads. Our results require minimal hypotheses on the underlying model category \mathcal{M}, and these hypotheses vary depending on what is known about the colored operads in question. We obtain results for the classes of colored operad which are cofibrant as a symmetric collection, entrywise cofibrant, or arbitrary. As the hypothesis on the operad is weakened, the hypotheses on \mathcal{M} must be strengthened. Via a careful development of the categorical algebra of colored operads we provide a unified framework which allows us to build (semi-)model structures for all three of these classes of colored operads. We then apply these results to provide conditions on \mathcal{M}, on the colored operad \mathcal{O}, and on a class \mathcal{C} of morphisms in \mathcal{M} so that the left Bousfield localization of \mathcal{M} with respect to \mathcal{C} preserves \mathcal{O}-algebras.
