We consider the (finite-dimensional) small quantum group \bar{U}_q sl(2) at q=i. We show that \bar{U}_i sl(2) does not allow for an R-matrix, even though U \otimes V \cong V \otimes U holds for all finite-dimensional representations U,V of \bar{U}_i sl(2). We then give an explicit coassociator \Phi and an R-matrix R such that \bar{U}_i sl(2) becomes a quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra.   Our construction is motivated by the two-dimensional chiral conformal field theory of symplectic fermions with central charge c=-2. There, a braided monoidal category, \mathcal{SF}, has been computed from the factorisation and monodromy properties of conformal blocks, and we prove that \mathrm{Rep}\,(\bar{U}_i sl(2),\Phi,R) is braided monoidally equivalent to \mathcal{SF}.
