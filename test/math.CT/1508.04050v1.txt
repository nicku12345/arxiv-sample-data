We show that every action operad gives rise to a notion of monoidal category via the categorical version of the Borel construction, embedding action operads into the category of 2-monads on \mathbf{Cat}. We characterize those 2-monads in the image of this embedding, and as an example show that the theory of coboundary categories corresponds precisely to the operad of n-fruit cactus groups. We finally define \mathbf{\Lambda}-multicategories for an action operad \mathbf{\Lambda}, and show that they arise as monads in a Kleisli bicategory.
