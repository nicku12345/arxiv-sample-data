As we proved earlier, for a triangulated category \underline{C} endowed with a weight structure w and a triangulated subcategory \underline{D} of \underline{C} (strongly) generated by cones of a set of morphisms S in the heart \underline{Hw} of w there exists a weight structure w' on the Verdier quotient \underline{C}'=\underline{C}/\underline{D} such that the localization functor \underline{C} \to \underline{C}' is weight-exact (i.e., "respects weights"). The goal of this paper is to find conditions ensuring that for any object of \underline{C}' of non-negative (resp. non-positive) weights there exists its preimage in \underline{C} satisfying the same condition; we call a certain stronger version of the latter assumption the left (resp., right) weight lifting property. We prove that these weight lifting properties are fulfilled whenever the set S satisfies the corresponding (left or right) Ore conditions. Moreover, if \underline{D} is generated by objects of \underline{Hw} then any object of \underline{Hw}' lifts to \underline{Hw}. We apply these results to obtain some new results on Tate motives and finite spectra (in the stable homotopy category). Our results are also applied to the study of the so-called Chow-weight homology in another paper.
