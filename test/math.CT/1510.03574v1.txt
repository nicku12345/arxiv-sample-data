In the terms of an `n-periodic derived category', we describe explicitly how the orbit category of the bounded derived category of an algebra with respect to powers of the shift functor embeds in its triangulated hull. We obtain a large class of algebras whose orbit categories are strictly smaller than their triangulated hulls and a realization of the phenomenon that an automorphism need not induce the identity functor on the associated orbit category.
