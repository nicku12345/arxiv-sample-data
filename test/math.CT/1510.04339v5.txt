To every object X of a symmetric tensor category over a field of characteristic p>0 we attach p-adic integers \text{Dim}_+(X) and \text{Dim}_-(X) whose reduction modulo p is the categorical dimension \text{dim}(X) of X, coinciding with the usual dimension when X is a vector space. We study properties of \text{Dim}_{\pm}(X), and in particular show that they don't always coincide with each other, and can take any value in \mathbb{Z}_p. We also discuss the connection of p-adic dimensions with the theory of \lambda-rings and Brauer characters.
