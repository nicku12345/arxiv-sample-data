Ng and Schauenburg generalized higher Frobenius-Schur indicators to pivotal fusion categories and showed that these indicators may be computed utilizing the modular data of the Drinfel'd center of the given category. We consider two classes of fusion categories generated by a single non-invertible simple object: near groups, those fusion categories with one non-invertible simple object, and Haagerup-Izumi categories, those with one non-invertible simple object for every invertible object. Examples of both types arise as representations of finite or quantum groups or as Jones standard invariants of finite-depth Murray-von Neumann subfactors. We utilize the Evans-Gannon computation of the tube algebras to obtain formulae for the Frobenius-Schur indicators of objects in both of these families.
