In an abelian category \mathscr{A} with small {\rm Ext} groups, we show that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between any two of the following: balanced pairs, subfunctors \mathcal{F} of {\rm Ext}^{1}_{\mathscr{A}}(-,-) such that \mathscr{A} has enough \mathcal{F}-projectives and enough \mathcal{F}-injectives and Quillen exact structures \mathcal{E} with enough \mathcal{E}-projectives and enough \mathcal{E}-injectives. In this case, we get a strengthened version of the translation of the Wakamatsu lemma to the exact context, and also prove that subcategories which are \mathcal{E}-resolving and epimorphic precovering with kernels in their right \mathcal{E}-orthogonal class and subcategories which are \mathcal{E}-coresolving and monomorphic preenveloping with cokernels in their left \mathcal{E}-orthogonal class are determined by each other. Then we apply these results to construct some (pre)enveloping and (pre)covering classes and complete hereditary \mathcal{E}-cotorsion pairs in the module category.
