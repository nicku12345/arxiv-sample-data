Given an abelian p-group G of rank n, we construct an action of the torus \mathbb{T}^n on the stable module \infty-category of G-representations over a field of characteristic p. The homotopy fixed points are given by the \infty-category of module spectra over the Tate construction of the torus. The relationship thus obtained arises from a Galois extension in the sense of Rognes, with Galois group given by the torus. As one application, we give a homotopy-theoretic proof of Dade's classification of endotrivial modules for abelian p-groups. As another application, we give a slight variant of a key step in the Benson-Iyengar-Krause proof of the classification of localizing subcategories of the stable module category.
