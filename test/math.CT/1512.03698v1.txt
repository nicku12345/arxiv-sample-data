The aim of this paper is to show that the most elementary homotopy theory of \mathbf{G}-spaces is equivalent to a homotopy theory of simplicial sets over \mathbf{BG}, where \mathbf{G} is a fixed group. Both homotopy theories are presented as Relative categories. We establish the equivalence by constructing a strict homotopy equivalence between the two relative categories. No Model category structure is assumed on either Relative Category.
