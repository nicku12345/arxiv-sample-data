We categorify various finite-type cluster algebras with coefficients using completed orbit categories associated to Frobenius categories. Namely, the Frobenius categories we consider are the categories of finitely generated Gorenstein projective modules over the singular Nakajima category associated to a Dynkin diagram and their standard Frobenius quotients. In particular, we are able to categorify all finite-type skew-symmetric cluster algebras with universal coefficients and finite-type Grassmannian cluster algebras. Along the way, we classify the standard Frobenius models of a certain family of triangulated orbit categories which include all finite-type n-cluster categories, for all integers n\geq 1.
