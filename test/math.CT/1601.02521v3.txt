Let G be a discrete group. We prove that the category of G-posets admits a model structure that is Quillen equivalent to the standard model structure on G-spaces. As is already true nonequivariantly, the three classes of maps defining the model structure are not well understood calculationally. To illustrate, we exhibit some examples of cofibrant and fibrant posets and an example of a non-cofibrant finite poset.
