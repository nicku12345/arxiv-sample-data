These notes attempt to give a short survey of the approach to support theory and the study of lattices of triangulated subcategories through the machinery of tensor triangular geometry. One main aim is to introduce the material necessary to state and prove the local-to-global principle. In particular, we discuss Balmer's construction of the spectrum, generalised Rickard idempotents and support for compactly generated triangulated categories, and actions of tensor triangulated categories. Several examples are also given along the way. These notes are based on a series of lectures given during the Spring 2015 program on 'Interactions between Representation Theory, Algebraic Topology and Commutative Algebra' (IRTATCA) at the CRM in Barcelona.
