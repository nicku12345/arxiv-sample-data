We prove that a connected commutator (or NC) complete associative algebra can be recovered in the derived setting from its abelianization together with its natural induced structure. Specifically, we prove an equivalence between connected derived commutator complete associative algebras and connected commutative algebras equipped with a coaction of the comonad arising from the adjunction between associative and commutative algebras. This provides a Koszul dual description of connected derived commutator (or NC) complete associative algebras and furthermore may be interpreted as a theory of relative Koszul duality for the associative operad relative to the commutative operad. We also prove analogous results in the setting of En-algebras. That is, we develop a theory of commutator complete En-algebras and a theory of relative Koszul duality for the En operad relative to the commutative operad. We relate the derived commutator filtration on associative and En-algebras to the filtration on the associative and En operad whose associated graded is the Poisson and shifted Poisson operad Pn. We argue that the derived commutator filtration on associative algebras (and En-algebras) are a relative analogue of the Goodwillie tower of the identity functor on the model category of associative algebras (and En-algebras) relative to the model category of commutative algebras.
