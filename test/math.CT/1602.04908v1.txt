Floer field theory is a construction principle for e.g. 3-manifold invariants via decomposition in a bordism category and a functor to the symplectic category, and is conjectured to have natural 4-dimensional extensions. This survey provides an introduction to the categorical language for the construction and extension principles and provides the basic intuition for two gauge theoretic examples which conceptually frame Atiyah-Floer type conjectures in Donaldson theory as well as the relations of Heegaard Floer homology to Seiberg-Witten theory.
