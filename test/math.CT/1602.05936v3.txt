A finite bosonic or fermionic symmetry can be described uniquely by a symmetric fusion category \mathcal{E}. In this work, we propose that 2+1D topological/SPT orders with a fixed finite symmetry \mathcal{E} are classified, up to E_8 quantum Hall states, by the unitary modular tensor categories \mathcal{C} over \mathcal{E} and the modular extensions of each \mathcal{C}. In the case \mathcal{C}=\mathcal{E}, we prove that the set \mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E}) of all modular extensions of \mathcal{E} has a natural structure of a finite abelian group. We also prove that the set \mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{C}) of all modular extensions of \mathcal{C}, if not empty, is equipped with a natural \mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})-action that is free and transitive. Namely, the set \mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{C}) is an \mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E})-torsor. As special cases, we explain in details how the group \mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E}) recovers the well-known group-cohomology classification of the 2+1D bosonic SPT orders and Kitaev's 16 fold ways. We also discuss briefly the behavior of the group \mathcal{M}_{ext}(\mathcal{E}) under the symmetry-breaking processes and its relation to Witt groups.
