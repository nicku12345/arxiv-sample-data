We compare the so-called clock condition to the gradability of certain differential modules over quadratic monomial algebras. For a stably hereditary algebra or a gentle one-cycle algebra, these considerations show that the orbit category of its bounded derived category with respect to a positive power of the shift functor is triangulated if and only if the algebra is piecewise hereditary.
