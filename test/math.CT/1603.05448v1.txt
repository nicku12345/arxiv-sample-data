There are Quillen equivalent Thomason model structures on the category of small categories, the category of small acyclic categories and the category of posets. These share the property that cofibrant objects are posets. In fact, they share the same class of cofibrant objects. We show that every finite semilattice, every chain, every countable tree, every finite zigzag and every poset with five or less elements is cofibrant in all of those structures.
