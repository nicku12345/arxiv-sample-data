We know that the model theory of modules leads to a way of obtaining definable categories of modules over a ring R as the kernels of certain functors (R\textbf{-Mod})^{\text{op}}\to\textbf{Ab} rather than of functors R\textbf{-Mod}\to\textbf{Ab} which are given by a pp pair. This paper will give various algebraic characterisations of these functors in the case that R is an artin algebra.   Suppose that R is an artin algebra. An additive functor G:(R\textbf{-Mod})^{\text{op}}\to\textbf{Ab} preserves inverse limits and G|_{(R\textbf{-mod})^{\text{op}}}:(R\textbf{-mod})^{\text{op}}\to\textbf{Ab} is finitely presented if and only if there is a sequence of natural transformations (-,A)\to(-,B)\to G\to 0 for some A,B\in R\textbf{-mod} which is exact when evaluated at any left R-module. Any additive functor (R\textbf{-Mod})^{\text{op}}\to\textbf{Ab} with one of these equivalent properties has a definable kernel, and every definable subcategory of R\textbf{-Mod} can be obtained as the kernel of a family of such functors.   In the final section a generalised setting is introduced, so that our results apply to more categories than those of the form R\textbf{-Mod} for an artin algebra R. That is, our results are extended to those locally finitely presented K-linear categories whose finitely presented objects form a dualising K-variety, where K is a commutative artinian ring.
