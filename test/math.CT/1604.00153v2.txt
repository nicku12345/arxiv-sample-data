Making use of Freyd's free abelian category on a preadditive category we show that if T:D\rightarrow \mathcal{A} is a representation of a quiver D in an abelian category \mathcal{A} then there is an abelian category \mathcal{A} (T), a faithful exact functor F_T: \mathcal{A} (T) \to \mathcal{A} and an induced representation \tilde T: D \to \mathcal{A} (T) such that F_T\tilde T= T universally. We then can show that \mathbb{T}-motives as well as Nori's motives are given by a certain category of functors on definable categories.
