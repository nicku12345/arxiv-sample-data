Continuing our previous work on graded twisting of Hopf algebras and monoidal categories, we introduce a graded twisting construction for equivariant comodule algebras and module categories. As an example we study actions of quantum subgroups of G\subset SL_{-1}(2) on K_{-1}[x,y] and show that in most cases the corresponding invariant rings K_{-1}[x,y]^G are invariant rings K[x,y]^{G'} for the action of a classical subgroup G'\subset SL(2). As another example we study Poisson boundaries of graded twisted categories and show that under the assumption of weak amenability they are graded twistings of the Poisson boundaries.
