Auslander-Reiten duality for module categories is generalised to Grothendieck abelian categories that have a sufficient supply of finitely presented objects. It is shown that Auslander-Reiten duality amounts to the fact that the functor Ext^1(C,-) into modules over the endomorphism ring of C admits a partially defined right adjoint when C is a finitely presented object. This result seems to be new even for module categories. For appropriate schemes over a field, the connection with Serre duality is discussed.
