Let p be an odd prime number. In this paper, we show that the genome \Gamma(P) of a finite p-group P, defined as the direct product of the genotypes of all rational irreducible representations of P, can be recovered from the first group of K-theory K_1(\mathbb{Q}P). It follows that the assignment P \to \Gamma(P) is a p-biset functor. We give an explicit formula for the action of bisets on \Gamma, in terms of generalized transfers associated to left free bisets. Finally, we show that \Gamma is a rational p-biset functor, i.e. that \Gamma factors through the Roquette category of finite p-groups.
