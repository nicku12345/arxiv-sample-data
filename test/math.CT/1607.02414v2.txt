We study the problem of convergence to the boundary in the setting of random walks on discrete quantum groups. Convergence to the boundary is established for random walks on \hat{\textrm{SU}_q(2)}. Furthermore, we will define the Martin boundary for random walks on C^*-tensor categories and give a formulation for convergence to the boundary for such random walks. These categorical definitions are shown to be compatible with the definitions in the quantum group case. This implies that convergence to the boundary for random walks on quantum groups is stable under monoidal equivalence.
