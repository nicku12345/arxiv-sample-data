We give sufficient conditions to ensure that the ideal \Phi(\mathcal E) of \mathcal E-phantom maps in a locally \lambda-presentable exact category (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{E}) is (special) (pre)covering ideal, where \mathcal E is an exact substructure of (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{E}). As a byproduct, we infer the existence of various covering ideals in categories of sheaves which have a meaningful geometrical motivation. In particular we deal with a Zariski-local notion of phantom maps in categories of sheaves. We would like to point out that our approach is necessarily different from [FGHT13], as the categories involved in most of the examples we are interested in do not have enough projective morphisms.
