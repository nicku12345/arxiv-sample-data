In this paper we develop a theory of stability for G-categories (presheaf of categories on the orbit category of G), where G is a finite group. We give a description of Mackey functors as G-commutative monoids exploit it to characterize G-spectra as the G-stabilization of G-spaces. As an application of this we provide an alternative proof of a theorem by Guillou and May. The theory here is developed in the more general setting of orbital categories.
