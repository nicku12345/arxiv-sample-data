The "theory of open sub-functorial dynamics" is a new theory that defines interacting generalized dynamical systems. The interactions between these dynamics produce new dynamics which, of course, can then enter into other interactions. A major part of this article can already be found in two unpublished texts and it has been partially exposed in conferences. However, we need to give a new, unified and therefore more convenient presentation of this material, and we also need some examples to illustrate it. Moreover, we introduce in this article the new concepts of "normal interaction" and "concrete interaction", and replace the previously used rigid synchronizations by much more general flexible ones.
