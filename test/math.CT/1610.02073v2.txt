For an abelian category \mathcal{A} we investigate when the stable categories \underline{\mathrm{GPro}}\mathrm{j}(\mathcal{A}) and \underline{\mathrm{GIn}}\mathrm{j}(\mathcal{A}) are triangulated equivalent. To this end, we realize these stable categories as homotopy categories of certain (non-trivial) model categories and give conditions on \mathcal{A} that ensure the existence of a Quillen equivalence between the model categories in question. We also study when such a Quillen equivalence transfers from \mathcal{A} to categories naturally associated to \mathcal{A}, such as \mathrm{Ch}(\mathcal{A}), the category of chain complexes in \mathcal{A}, or \mathrm{Rep}(Q,\mathcal{A}), the category of \mathcal{A}-valued representations of a quiver Q.
