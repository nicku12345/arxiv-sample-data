Let k be a commutative \mathbb{Q}-algebra. We study families of functors between categories of finitely generated R-modules which are defined for all commutative k-algebras R simultaneously and are compatible with base changes. These operations turn out to be Schur functors associated to k-linear representations of symmetric groups. This result is closely related to Macdonald's classification of polynomial functors.
