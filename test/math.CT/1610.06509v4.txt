We investigate conditions for when the t-structure of Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} associated to a torsion pair is a compactly generated t-structure. The concept of a tCG torsion pair is introduced and for any ring R, we prove that \mathbf{t}=(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F}) is a tCG torsion pair in R\text{-Mod} if, and only if, there exists, \{T_{\lambda}\} a set of finitely presented R-modules in \mathcal{T}, such that \mathcal{F}=\bigcap \text{Ker}({\text{Hom}}_{R}(T_{\lambda},?)). We also show that every tCG torsion pair is of finite type, and show that the reciprocal is not true. Finally, we give a precise description of the tCG torsion pairs over Noetherian rings and von Neumman regular rings.
