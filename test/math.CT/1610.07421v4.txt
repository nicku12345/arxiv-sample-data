The aim of this article is to explain a philosophy for applying higher dimensional Seifert-van Kampen Theorems, and how the use of groupoids and strict higher groupoids resolves some foundational anomalies in algebraic topology at the border between homology and homotopy. We explain some applications to filtered spaces, and special cases of them, while a sequel will show the relevance to n-cubes of pointed spaces.
