In this paper, we further explore the conceptual approach to cyclic cohomology with coefficients. In particular we give a derived version of the definition with better invariance properties. We show that the new definition agrees with the old under certain conditions and we prove, for the new definition, both its Morita invariance and its 2-Morita invariance, under suitable interpretations of these terms. More generally, we prove a version of Shapiro's lemma for cyclic cohomology with coefficients.
