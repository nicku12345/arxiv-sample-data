In this article, we define operator algebras internal to a rigid C*-tensor category \mathcal{C}. A C*/W*-algebra object in \mathcal{C} is an algebra object \mathbf{A} in \operatorname{ind}-\mathcal{C} whose category of free modules {\sf FreeMod}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathbf{A}) is a \mathcal{C}-module C*/W*-category respectively. When \mathcal{C}={\sf Hilb_{f.d.}}, the category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, we recover the usual notions of operator algebras.   We generalize basic representation theoretic results, such as the Gelfand-Naimark and von Neumann bicommutant theorems, along with the GNS construction. We define the notion of completely positive maps between C*-algebra objects in \mathcal{C} and prove the analog of the Stinespring dilation theorem.   As an application, we discuss approximation and rigidity properties, including amenability, the Haagerup property, and property (T) for a connected W*-algebra \mathbf{M} in \mathcal{C}. Our definitions simultaneously unify the definitions of analytic properties for discrete quantum groups and rigid C*-tensor categories.
