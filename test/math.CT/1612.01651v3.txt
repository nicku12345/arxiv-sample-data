The Defect Recollement, Restriction Recollement, Auslander-Gruson-Jensen Recollement, and others, are shown to be instances of a general construction using derived functors and methods from stable module theory. The right derived functors \textsf{W}_k:=R_k(\hspace{0.05cm}\underline{\ \ }\hspace{0.1cm} )^* are computed and it is shown that the functor \textsf{W}_2:=R_2(\hspace{0.05cm}\underline{\ \ }\hspace{0.1cm} )^* is right exact and restricts to a duality \textsf{W} of the defect zero functors. The duality \textsf{W} satisfies two identities which we call the Generalised Auslander-Reiten formulas. We show that \textsf{W} restricts to the generalised Auslander-Bridger transpose and show that the Generalised Auslander-Reiten formulas reduce to the well-known Auslander-Reiten formulas.
