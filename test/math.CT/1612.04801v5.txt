We prove the following generalization of a classical result of Adams: for any pointed and connected topological space (X,b), that is not necessarily simply connected, the cobar construction of the differential graded (dg) coalgebra of normalized singular chains in X with vertices at b is weakly equivalent as a differential graded associative algebra (dga) to the singular chains on the Moore based loop space of X at b. We deduce this statement from several more general categorical results of independent interest. We construct a functor \mathfrak{C}_{\square_c} from simplicial sets to categories enriched over cubical sets with connections which, after triangulation of their mapping spaces, coincides with Lurie's rigidification functor \mathfrak{C} from simplicial sets to simplicial categories. Taking normalized chains of the mapping spaces of \mathfrak{C}_{\square_c} yields a functor \Lambda from simplicial sets to dg categories which is the left adjoint to the dg nerve functor. For any simplicial set S with S_0=\{x\}, \Lambda(S)(x,x) is a dga isomorphic to \Omega Q_{\Delta}(S), the cobar construction on the dg coalgebra Q_{\Delta}(S) of normalized chains on S. We use these facts to show that Q_{\Delta} sends categorical equivalences between simplicial sets to maps of connected dg coalgebras which induce quasi-isomorphisms of dga's under the cobar functor.
