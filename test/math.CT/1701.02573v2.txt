For a separated Noetherian scheme X with an ample family of line bundles and a non-zero-divisor W\in\Gamma(X,L) of a line bundle L on X, we classify certain thick subcategories of the derived matrix factorization category {\rm DMF}(X,L,W) of the Landau-Ginzburg model (X,L,W). Furthermore, by using the classification result and the theory of Balmer's tensor triangular geometry, we show that the spectrum of the tensor triangulated category ({\rm DMF}(X,L,W), \otimes^{\frac{1}{2}}) is homeomorphic to the relative singular locus {\rm Sing}(X_0/X), introduced in this paper, of the zero scheme X_0\subset X of W.
