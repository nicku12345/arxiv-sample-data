We explicitly construct an SO(2)-action on a skeletal version of the 2-dimensional framed bordism bicategory. By the 2-dimensional Cobordism Hypothesis for framed manifolds, we obtain an SO(2)-action on the core of fully-dualizable objects of the target bicategory. This action is shown to coincide with the one given by the Serre automorphism. We give an explicit description of the bicategory of homotopy fixed points of this action, and discuss its relation to the classification of oriented 2d topological quantum field theories.
