In a previous study, the algebraic formulation of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FFTC) is shown to allow extensions of differential and Rota-Baxter operators on the one hand, and to give rise to categorical explanations using the ideas of liftings of monads and comonads, and mixed distributive laws on the other. Generalizing the FFTC, we consider in this paper a class of constraints between a differential operator and a Rota-Baxter operator. For a given constraint, we show that the existences of extensions of differential and Rota-Baxter operators, of liftings of monads and comonads, and of mixed distributive laws are equivalent.
