We propose a generalisation for the notion of the centre of an algebra in the setup of algebras graded by an arbitrary abelian group G.   Our generalisation, which we call the G-centre, is designed to control the endomorphism category of the grading shift functors. We show that the G-centre is preserved by gradable derived equivalences given by tilting modules. We also discuss links with existing notions in superalgebra theory and apply our results to derived equivalences of superalgebras.
