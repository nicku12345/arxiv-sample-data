In an earlier work, we constructed the almost strict Morse n-category \mathcal X which extends Cohen \& Jones \& Segal's flow category. In this article, we define two other almost strict n-categories \mathcal V and \mathcal W where \mathcal V is based on homomorphisms between real vector spaces and \mathcal W consists of tuples of positive integers. The Morse index and the dimension of the Morse moduli spaces give rise to almost strict n-category functors \mathcal F : \mathcal X \to \mathcal V and \mathcal G : \mathcal X \to \mathcal W.
