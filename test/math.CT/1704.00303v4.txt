We generalize Freyd's well-known result that "homotopy is not concrete", offering a general method to show that under certain assumptions on a model category \mathcal M, its homotopy category \text{ho}(\mathcal M) cannot be concrete. This result is part of an attempt to understand more deeply the relation between set theory and abstract homotopy theory.
