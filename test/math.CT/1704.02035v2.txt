We give a characterization of extremal irreducible discrete subfactors (N\subseteq M, E) where N is type {\rm II}_1 in terms of connected W*-algebra objects in rigid C*-tensor categories. We prove an equivalence of categories where the morphisms for discrete inclusions are normal N-N bilinear ucp maps which preserve the state \tau \circ E, and the morphisms for W*-algebra objects are categorical ucp morphisms.   As an application, we get a well-behaved notion of the standard invariant of an extremal irreducible discrete subfactor, together with a subfactor reconstruction theorem. Thus our equivalence provides many new examples of discrete inclusions (N\subseteq M, E), in particular, examples where M is type {\rm III} coming from non Kac-type discrete quantum groups and associated module W*-categories. Finally, we obtain a Galois correspondence between intermediate subfactors of an extremal irreducible discrete inclusion and intermediate W*-algebra objects.
