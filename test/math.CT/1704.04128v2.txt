We give a new categorical way to construct the central stability homology of Putman and Sam and explain how it can be used in the context of representation stability and homological stability. In contrast to them, we cover categories with infinite automorphism groups. We also connect central stability homology to Randal-Williams and Wahl's work on homological stability. We also develop a criterion that implies that functors that are polynomial in the sense of Randal-Williams and Wahl are centrally stable in the sense of Putman.
