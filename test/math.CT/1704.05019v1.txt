In this paper, I introduce weak representations of a Lie groupoid G. I also show that there is an equivalence of categories between the categories of 2-term representations up to homotopy and weak representations of G. Furthermore, I show that any VB-groupoid is isomorphic to an action groupoid associated to a weak representation on its kernel groupoid; this relationship defines an equivalence of categories between the categories of weak representations of G and the category of VB-groupoids over G.
