We define a symmetric monoidal (4,3)-category with duals whose objects are certain enriched multi-fusion categories. For every modular tensor category \mathcal{C}, there is a self enriched multi-fusion category \mathfrak{C} giving rise to an object of this symmetric monoidal (4,3)-category. We conjecture that the extended 3D TQFT given by the fully dualizable object \mathfrak{C} extends the 1-2-3-dimensional Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT associated to the modular tensor category \mathcal{C} down to dimension zero.
