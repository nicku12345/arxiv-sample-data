We give an elementary construction of a certain class of model structures. In particular, we rederive the Kan model structure on simplicial sets without the use of topological spaces, minimal complexes, or any concrete model of fibrant replacement such as Kan's Ex^infinity functor. Our argument makes crucial use of the glueing construction developed by Cohen et al. in the specific setting of certain cubical sets.
