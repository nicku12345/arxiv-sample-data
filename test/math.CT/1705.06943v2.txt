Recently de Thanhoffer de V\"olcsey and Van den Bergh classified the Euler forms on a free abelian group of rank 4 having the properties of the Euler form of a smooth projective surface. There are two types of solutions: one corresponding to \mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1 (and noncommutative quadrics), and an infinite family indexed by the natural numbers. For m=0,1 there are commutative and noncommutative surfaces having this Euler form, whilst for m\geq 2 there are no commutative surfaces. In this paper we construct sheaves of maximal orders on surfaces having these Euler forms, giving a geometric construction for their numerical blowups.
