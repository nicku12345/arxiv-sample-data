Presentations for unbraided, braided and symmetric pseudomonoids are defined. Biequivalences characterising the semistrict bicategories generated by these presentations are proven. It is shown that these biequivalences categorify results in the theory of monoids and commutative monoids, and generalise standard coherence theorems for braided and symmetric monoidal categories.
