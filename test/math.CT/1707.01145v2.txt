It is proved that the category of simplicial complete bornological spaces over \mathbb R carries a combinatorial monoidal model structure satisfying the monoid axiom. For any commutative monoid in this category the category of modules is also a monoidal model category with all cofibrant objects being flat. In particular, weak equivalences between these monoids induce Quillen equivalences between the corresponding categories of modules. On the other hand, it is also proved that the functor of pre-compact bornology applied to simplicial C^\infty-rings preserves and reflects weak equivalences, thus assigning stable model categories of modules to simplicial C^\infty-rings.
