We show that given a rigid C*-tensor category, there is an equivalence of categories between normalized irreducible Q-systems, also known as connected unitary Frobenius algebra objects, and compact connected W*-algebra objects. Although this result could be proved as a corollary of our previous article on realizations of algebra objects and discrete subfactors, we prove it here directly via categorical methods without passing through subfactor theory.
