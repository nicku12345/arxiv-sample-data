We present applications of the notion of isomorphic vector fields to the study of nonlinear stability of relative equilibria. Isomorphic vector fields were introduced by Hepworth [Theory Appl. Categ. 22 (2009), 542-587] in his study of vector fields on differentiable stacks. Here we argue in favor of the usefulness of replacing an equivariant vector field by an isomorphic one to study nonlinear stability of relative equilibria. In particular, we use this idea to obtain a criterion for nonlinear stability. As an application, we offer an alternative proof of Montaldi and Rodr\'iguez-Olmos's criterion [arXiv:1509.04961] for stability of Hamiltonian relative equilibria.
