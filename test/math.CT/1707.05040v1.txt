We generalise notions of Gorenstein homological algebra for rings to the context of arbitrary abelian categories. The results are strongest for module categories of rngs with enough idempotents. We also reformulate the notion of Frobenius extensions of noetherian rings into a setting which allows for direct generalisation to arbitrary abelian categories.   The abstract theory is then applied to the BGG category O for Lie superalgebras, which can now be seen as a "Frobenius extension" of the corresponding category for the underlying Lie algebra and is therefore "Gorenstein". In particular we obtain new and more general formulae for the Serre functors and instigate the theory of Gorenstein extension groups.
