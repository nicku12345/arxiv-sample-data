We use recollement and HRS-tilt to describe bounded t-structures on the bounded derived category \mathcal{D}^b(\mathbb{X}) of coherent sheaves over a weighted projective line \mathbb{X} of virtual genus \leq 1. We will see from our description that the combinatorics in classification of bounded t-structures on \mathcal{D}^b(\mathbb{X}) can be reduced to that in classification of bounded t-structures on bounded derived categories of finite dimensional right modules over representation-finite finite dimensional hereditary algebras.
