In this article, we investigate the category \mathcal{A}^G of equivariant objects of an additive category \mathcal{A} with respect to an action of a finite group G. We show that if G is solvable then we can reconstruct \mathcal{A} from \mathcal{A}^G via a finite sequence of equivariantization. We also consider the possibility of a triangulated structure on \mathcal{A}^G canonical in certain sense when \mathcal{A} is triangulated and give several instances in which \mathcal{A}^G is indeed canonically triangulated.
