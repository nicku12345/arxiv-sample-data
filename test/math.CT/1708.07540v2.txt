We prove that given any strong, stable derivator and a t-structure on its base triangulated category \cal D, the t-structure canonically lifts to all the (coherent) diagram categories and each incoherent diagram in the heart uniquely lifts to a coherent one. We use this to show that the t-structure being compactly generated implies that the coaisle is closed under directed homotopy colimit which in turns implies that the heart is an (Ab.5) Abelian category. If, moreover, \cal D is a well generated algebraic or topological triangulated category, then the heart of any accessibly embedded (in particular, compactly generated) t-structure has a generator. As a consequence, it follows that the heart of any compactly generated t-structure of a well generated algebraic or topological triangulated category is a Grothendieck category.
