We continue the theory of \tT-systems from the work of the second author, describing both ground systems and module systems over a ground system (paralleling the theory of modules over an algebra). The theory, summarized categorically at the end, encapsulates general algebraic structures lacking negation but possessing a map resembling negation, such as tropical algebras, hyperfields and fuzzy rings. We see explicitly how it encompasses tropical algebraic theory and hyperfields.   Prime ground systems are introduced as a way of developing geometry. The polynomial system over a prime system is prime, and there is a weak Nullstellensatz. Also, the polynomial \mathcal A[\la_1, \dots, \la_n] and Laurent polynomial systems \mathcal A[[\la_1, \dots, \la_n]] in n commuting indeterminates over a \tT-semiring-group system have dimension n.   For module systems, special attention also is paid to tensor products and \Hom. Abelian categories are replaced by "semi-abelian" categories (where \Hom(A,B) is not a group) with a negation morphism.
