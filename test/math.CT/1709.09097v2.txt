Given a perfect field of exponential characteristic e and a functor f:\mathcal A\to\mathcal B between symmetric monoidal strict V-categories of correspondences satisfying the cancellation property such that the induced morphisms of complexes of Nisnevich sheaves   f_*:\mathbb Z_{\mathcal A}(q)[1/e]\to\mathbb Z_{\mathcal B}(q)[1/e],\quad q\geq 0, are quasi-isomorphisms, it is proved that for every k-smooth algebraic variety X the morphisms of twisted motives of X with \mathbb Z[1/e]-coefficients   M_{\mathcal A}(X)(q)\otimes\mathbb Z[1/e]\to M_{\mathcal B}(X)(q)\otimes\mathbb Z[1/e] are quasi-isomorphisms. Furthermore, it is shown that the induced functors between triangulated categories of motives   DM_{\mathcal A}^{eff}(k)[1/e]\to DM_{\mathcal B}^{eff}(k)[1/e],\quad DM_{\mathcal A}(k)[1/e]\to DM_{\mathcal B}(k)[1/e] are equivalences. As an application, the Cor-, K_0^\oplus-, K_0- and \mathbb K_0-motives of smooth algebraic varieties with \mathbb Z[1/e]-coefficients are locally quasi-isomorphic to each other. Moreover, their triangulated categories of motives with \mathbb Z[1/e]-coefficients are shown to be equivalent. Another application is given for the bivariant motivic spectral sequence.
