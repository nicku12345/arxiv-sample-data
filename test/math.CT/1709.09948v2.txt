We say that an exact equivalence between the derived categories of two algebraic varieties is tilting-type if it is constructed by using tilting bundles. The aim of this article is to understand the behavior of tilting-type equivalences for crepant resolutions under deformations. As an application of the method that we establish in this article, we study the derived equivalence for stratified Mukai flops and stratified Atiyah flops in terms of tilting bundles.
