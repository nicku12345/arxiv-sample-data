In this article, we develop a notion of Quillen bifibration which combines the two notions of Grothendieck bifibration and of Quillen model structure. In particular, given a bifibration p:\mathcal E\to\mathcal B, we describe when a family of model structures on the fibers \mathcal E_A and on the basis category \mathcal B combines into a model structure on the total category \mathcal E, such that the functor p preserves cofibrations, fibrations and weak equivalences. Using this Grothendieck construction for model structures, we revisit the traditional definition of Reedy model structures, and possible generalizations, and exhibit their bifibrational nature.
