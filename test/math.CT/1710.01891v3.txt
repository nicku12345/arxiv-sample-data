Fix sets X and Y, and write \mathcal{PT}_{XY} for the set of all partial functions X\to Y. Fix a partial function a:Y\to X, and define the operation \star_a on \mathcal{PT}_{XY} by f\star_ag=fag for f,g\in\mathcal{PT}_{XY}. The sandwich semigroup (\mathcal{PT}_{XY},\star_a) is denoted \mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a. We apply general results from Part I to thoroughly describe the structural and combinatorial properties of \mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a, as well as its regular and idempotent-generated subsemigroups, Reg(\mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a) and \mathbb E(\mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a). After describing regularity, stability and Green's relations and preorders, we exhibit Reg(\mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a) as a pullback product of certain regular subsemigroups of the (non-sandwich) partial transformation semigroups \mathcal{PT}_X and \mathcal{PT}_Y, and as a kind of "inflation" of \mathcal{PT}_A, where A is the image of the sandwich element a. We also calculate the rank (minimal size of a generating set) and, where appropriate, the idempotent rank (minimal size of an idempotent generating set) of \mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a, Reg(\mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a) and \mathbb E(\mathcal{PT}_{XY}^a). The same program is also carried out for sandwich semigroups of totally defined functions and for injective partial functions. Several corollaries are obtained for various (non-sandwich) semigroups of (partial) transformations with restricted image, domain and/or kernel.
