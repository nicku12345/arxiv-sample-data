For any compact Lie group G, we give a description of genuine G-spectra in terms of the naive equivariant spectra underlying their geometric fixedpoints. We use this to give an analogous description of cyclotomic spectra in terms of naive T-spectra (where T denotes the circle group), generalizing Nikolaus--Scholze's recent work in the eventually-connective case. We also give an explicit formula for the homotopy invariants of the cyclotomic structure on a cyclotomic spectrum in these terms.
