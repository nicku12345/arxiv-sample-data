In this work, we establish a categorification of the classical Dold-Kan correspondence in the form of an equivalence between suitably defined \infty-categories of simplicial stable \infty-categories and connective chain complexes of stable \infty-categories. The result may be regarded as a contribution to the foundations of an emerging subject that could be termed categorified homological algebra.
