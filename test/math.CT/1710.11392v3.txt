Span categories provide a framework for formalizing mathematical models of open systems in classical mechanics. The categories appearing in classical mechanics do not have pullbacks, which requires the use of generalized span categories. We introduce categories \LagSy and \HamSy that respectively provide a categorical framework for the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of open classical mechanical systems. The morphisms of \LagSy and \HamSy correspond to such open systems, and composition of morphisms models the construction of systems from subsystems. The Legendre transformation gives a functor from \LagSy to \HamSy that translates from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian perspective.
