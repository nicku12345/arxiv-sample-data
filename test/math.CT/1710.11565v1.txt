We consider triangulations of surfaces with edges painted three colors so that edges of each triangle have different colors. Such structures arise as Belyi data (or Grothendieck dessins d'enfant), on the other hand they enumerate pairs of permutations determined up to a common conjugation. The topic of these notes is links of such combinatorial structures with infinite symmetric groups and their representations.
