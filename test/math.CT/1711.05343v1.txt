We construct a direct sum completion \mathcal{C}_{\oplus} of a given braided monoidal category \mathcal{C} which allows for the rigorous treatment of infinite order simple current extensions of vertex operator algebras as seen in \cite{CKL}. As an example, we construct the vertex operator algebra V_L associated to an even lattice L as an infinite order simple current extension of the Heisenberg VOA and recover the structure of its module category through categorical considerations.
