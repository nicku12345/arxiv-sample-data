In this paper we introduce the local Nori fundamental group scheme of a reduced scheme or algebraic stack over a perfect field k. We give particular attention to the case of fields: to any field extension K/k we attach a pro-local group scheme over k. We show how this group has many analogies, but also some crucial differences, with the absolute Galois group. We propose two conjectures, analogous to the classical Neukirch-Uchida Theorem and Abhyankar Conjecture, providing some evidence in their favor. Finally we show that the local fundamental group of a normal variety is a quotient of the local fundamental group of an open, of its generic point (as it happens for the \'etale fundamental group) and even of any smooth neighborhood.
