This paper is dedicated to new methods of constructing weight structures and weight-exact localizations; our arguments generalize their bounded versions considered in previous papers of the authors. We start from a class of objects P of triangulated category C that satisfies a certain negativity condition (there are no C-extensions of positive degrees between elements of P; we actually need a somewhat stronger condition of this sort) to obtain a weight structure both "halves" of which are closed either with respect to C-coproducts of less than \alpha objects (for \alpha being a fixed regular cardinal) or with respect to all coproducts (provided that C is closed with respect to coproducts of this sort). This construction gives all "reasonable" weight structures satisfying the latter condition. In particular, we obtain certain weight structures on spectra (in SH) consisting of less than \alpha cells and on certain localizations of SH; these results are new.
