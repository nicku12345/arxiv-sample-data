We extend some classical results - such as Quillen's Theorem A, the Grothendieck construction, Thomason's Theorem and the characterisation of homotopically cofinal functors - from the homotopy theory of small categories to polynomial monads and their algebras.   As an application we give a categorical proof of the Dwyer-Hess and Turchin results concerning the explicit double delooping of spaces of long knots.
