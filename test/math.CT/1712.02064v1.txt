Yoneda'e Lemma is about the canonical isomorphism of all the natural transformations from a given representable covariant (contravariant, reps.) functor (from a locally small category to the category of sets) to a covariant (contravariant, reps.) functor. In this note we point out that given any representable functor and any functor we have the canonical natural transformation from the given representable functor to the "subset" functor of the given functor, "collecting all the natural transformations".
