We introduce the abstract notion of a closed necklical set in order to describe a functorial combinatorial model of the free loop fibration \Omega Y\rightarrow \Lambda Y\rightarrow Y over the geometric realization Y=|X| of a path connected simplicial set X. In particular, to any path connected simplicial set X we associate a closed necklical set \widehat{\mathbf{\Lambda}}X such that its geometric realization |\widehat{\mathbf{\Lambda}}X|, a space built out of gluing "freehedrical" and "cubical" cells, is homotopy equivalent to the free loop space \Lambda Y and the differential graded module of chains C_*(\widehat{\mathbf{\Lambda}}X) generalizes the coHochschild chain complex of the chain coalgebra C_\ast(X).
