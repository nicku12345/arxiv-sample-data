Let \mathfrak u be a compact semisimple Lie algebra, and \sigma be a Lie algebra involution of \mathfrak u. Let Rep_q(\mathfrak u) be the ribbon braided tensor C*-category of U_q(\mathfrak u)-representations for 0<q<1. We introduce three module C*-categories over Rep_q(\mathfrak u) starting from the input data (\mathfrak u,\sigma). The first construction is based on the theory of cyclotomic KZ-equations. The second construction uses the notion of quantum symmetric pair as developed by G. Letzter. The third construction uses a variation of Drinfeld twisting. In all three cases the module C*-category is ribbon twist-braided in the sense of A. Brochier---this is essentially due to B. Enriquez in the first case, is proved by S. Kolb in the second case, and is closely related to work of J. Donin, P. Kulish, and A. Mudrov in the third case. We formulate a conjecture concerning equivalence of these ribbon twist-braided module C*-categories, and confirm it in the rank one case.
