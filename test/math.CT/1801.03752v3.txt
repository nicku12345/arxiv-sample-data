The notion of Hochschild cochains induces an assignment from Aff, affine DG schemes, to monoidal DG categories. We show that this assignment extends, under some appropriate finiteness conditions, to a functor \mathbb H: Aff \to AlgBimod(DGCat), where the latter denotes the category of monoidal DG categories and bimodules. Now, any functor \mathbb A: Aff \to AlgBimod(DGCat) gives rise, by taking modules, to a theory of sheaves of categories ShvCat^{\mathbb A}.   In this paper, we study ShvCat^{\mathbb H}. Vaguely speaking, this theory categorifies the theory of D-modules, in the same way as Gaitsgory's original ShvCat categorifies the theory of quasi-coherent sheaves. We develop the functoriality of ShvCat^{\mathbb H}, its descent properties and, most importantly, the notion of \mathbb H-affineness. We then prove the \mathbb H-affineness of algebraic stacks: for Y a stack satisfying some mild conditions, the \infty-category ShvCat^{\mathbb H}(Y) is equivalent to the \infty-category of modules for \mathbb H(Y), the monoidal DG category defined in arXiv:1709.07867.   As an application, consider a quasi-smooth stack Y and a DG category C with an action of \mathbb H(Y). Then C admits a theory of singular support in Sing(Y), where Sing(Y) is the space of singularities of Y.
