We study fppf descent for enhanced derived categories. We revisit the work of [HS] and [TV08] in a lax context. More precisely, we construct a Cartesian and coCartesian fibration {}^{\mathrm{op}}\mathscr D^+_S\rightarrow N(\mathop{\mathrm{Sch}}_S) whose fibre over an S-scheme T is the opposite \mathscr D^+(T)^{\mathrm{op}} of the quasicategory of bounded below complexes of \mathscr O_T-modules. We show that this fibration satisfies fppf-descent for schemes.
