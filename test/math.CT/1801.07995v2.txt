We investigate the behavior of singularity categories and stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules along a morphism of rings. The natural context to approach the problem is via change of rings, that is, the classical adjoint triple between the module categories. In particular, we identify conditions on the change of rings to induce functors between the two singularity categories or the two stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules. Moreover, we study this problem at the level of `big singularity categories' in the sense of Krause. Along the way we establish an explicit construction of a right adjoint functor between certain homotopy categories. This is achieved by introducing the notion of 0-cocompact objects in triangulated categories and proving a dual version of Bousfield's localization lemma. We provide applications and examples illustrating our main results.
