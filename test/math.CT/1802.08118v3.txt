We consider the spherical DG category Sph_G attached to an affine algebraic group G. By definition, Sph_G := IndCoh(LS_G(S^2)) consists of ind-coherent sheaves of the stack of G-local systems on the 2-sphere S^2. The 3-dimensional version of the pair of pants endows Sph_G with an E_3-monoidal structure. More generally, for an algebraic stack Y (satisfying some mild conditions) and n \geq -1, we can look at the E_{n+1}-monoidal DG category Sph(Y,n) := IndCoh_0((Y^{S^n})^\wedge_Y), where IndCoh_0 is the sheaf theory introduced in [AG2] and [centerH]. % The case of Sph_G is recovered by setting Y =BG and n=2.   The cobordism hypothesis associates to Sph(Y,n) an (n+1)-dimensional TQFT, whose value of a manifold M^d of dimension d \leq n+1 (possibly with boundary) is given by the {topological chiral homology} \int_{M^d} Sph(Y,n). % In this paper, we compute such homology (in virtually all cases): we have the Stokes style formula  \int_{M^d} Sph(Y,n) \simeq IndCoh_0 ( (Y^{\partial(M^d \times D^{n+1-d})})^\wedge_{Y^M} ) ,  where the formal completion is constructed using the obvious projection \partial(M^d \times D^{n+1-d}) \to M^d.   The most interesting instance of this formula is for Sph_G \simeq Sph(BG,2), the original spherical category, and X a Riemann surface. In this case, we obtain a monoidal equivalence \int_X Sph_G \simeq H(LS_G^{Betti}(X)), where LS_G^{Betti}(X) is the stack of G-local systems on the topological space underlying X and H is the sheaf theory introduced in [centerH].
