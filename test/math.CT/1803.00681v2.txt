Given a family of model categories \cal E \to \cal R over a Reedy category, we outline a set of conditions which lead to the existence of a Reedy model structure on the category of sections {\sf Sect}(\cal R, \cal E). We prove that for a wide class of examples, this model structure serves as a strictification of the (\infty,1)-category of sections of the higher-categorical family associated to \cal E \to \cal R.
