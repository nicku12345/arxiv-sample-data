This paper develops a theory of monoidal categories relative to a braided monoidal category, called augmented monoidal categories. For such categories, balanced bimodules are defined using the formalism of balanced functors. The two main constructions are a relative tensor product of monoidal categories as well as a relative version of the monoidal center, which are Morita dual constructions. A general existence statement for a relative tensor products is derived from the existence of pseudo-colimits.   In examples, a category of locally finite weight modules over a quantized enveloping algebra is equivalent to the relative monoidal center of modules over its Borel part. A similar result holds for small quantum groups, without restricting to locally finite weight modules. More generally, for modules over braided bialgebras, the relative center is shown to be equivalent to the category of braided Yetter-Drinfeld modules (or crossed modules). This category corresponds to modules over the braided Drinfeld double (or double bosonization) which are locally finite for the action of the dual.
