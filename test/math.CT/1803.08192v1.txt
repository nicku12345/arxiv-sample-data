We study the relationship between singularity categories and relative singularity categories and discuss constructions of differential graded algebras of relative singularity categories. As consequences, we obtain structural results, which are known or generalise known results, on singularity categories of algebras with radical square zero, of non-commutative deformations of Kleinian singularities, of SL_3(\mathbb{C})-quotient singularities and of Gorenstein toric threefolds.
