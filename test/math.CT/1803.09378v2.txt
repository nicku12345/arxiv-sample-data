For any site of definition \mathcal C of a Grothendieck topos \mathcal E, we define a notion of a \mathcal C-ary Lawvere theory \tau: \mathscr C \to \mathscr T whose category of models is a stack over \mathcal E. Our definitions coincide with Lawvere's finitary theories when \mathcal C=\aleph_0 and \mathcal E = \operatorname{\mathbf {Set}}. We construct a fibered category \operatorname{\mathbf {Mod}}^{\mathscr T} of models as a stack over \mathcal E and prove that it is \mathcal E-complete and \mathcal E-cocomplete. We show that there is a free-forget adjunction F \dashv U: \operatorname{\mathbf {Mod}}^{\mathscr T} \rightleftarrows \mathscr E. If \tau is a commutative theory in a certain sense, then we obtain a ``locally monoidal closed'' structure on the category of models, which enhances the free-forget adjunction to an adjunction of symmetric monoidal \mathcal E-categories. Our results give a general recipe for constructing a monoidal \mathcal E-cosmos in which one can do enriched \mathcal E-category theory. As an application, we describe a convenient category of linear spaces generated by the theory of Lebesgue integration.
