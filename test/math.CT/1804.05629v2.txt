Let \mathcal{A} be an abelian category and \mathcal{B} be the Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} tilt of \mathcal{A} with respect to a torsion pair. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a derived equivalence between \mathcal{B} and \mathcal{A}, which is compatible with the inclusion of \mathcal{B} into the derived category of \mathcal{A}. In particular, any splitting torsion pair induces a derived equivalence. We prove that for the realization functor of any bounded t-structure, its denseness implies its fully-faithfulness.
