The quantum Satake correspondence relates dihedral Soergel bimodules to the semisimple quotient of the quantum \mathfrak{sl}_2 representation category. It also establishes a precise relation between the simple transitive 2-representations of both monoidal categories, which are indexed by bicolored \mathsf{ADE} Dynkin diagrams.   Using the quantum Satake correspondence between affine \mathsf{A}_{2} Soergel bimodules and the semisimple quotient of the quantum \mathfrak{sl}_3 representation category, we introduce trihedral Hecke algebras and Soergel bimodules, generalizing dihedral Hecke algebras and Soergel bimodules. These have their own Kazhdan-Lusztig combinatorics, simple transitive 2-representations corresponding to tricolored generalized \mathsf{ADE} Dynkin diagrams.
