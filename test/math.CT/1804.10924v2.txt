We study duals for objects and adjoints for k-morphisms in \operatorname{Alg}_n(\mathcal{S}), an (\infty,n+N)-category that models a higher Morita category for E_n algebra objects in a symmetric monoidal (\infty,N)-category \mathcal{S}. Our model of \operatorname{Alg}(\mathcal{S}) uses the geometrically convenient framework of factorization algebras. The main result is that \operatorname{Alg}_n(\mathcal{S}) is fully n-dualizable, verifying a conjecture of Lurie. Moreover, we unpack the consequences for a natural class of fully extended topological field theories and explore (n+1)-dualizability.
