This paper examines the category \mathbf{Mat}_{\bullet} of pointed matroids and strong maps from the point of view of Hall algebras. We show that \mathbf{Mat}_{\bullet} has the structure of a finitary proto-exact category - a non-additive generalization of exact category due to Dyckerhoff-Kapranov. We define the algebraic K-theory K_* (\mathbf{Mat}_{\bullet}) of \mathbf{Mat}_{\bullet} via the Waldhausen construction, and show that it is non-trivial, by exhibiting injections \pi^s_n (\mathbb{S}) \hookrightarrow K_n (\mathbf{Mat}_{\bullet}) from the stable homotopy groups of spheres for all n. Finally, we show that the Hall algebra of \mathbf{Mat}_{\bullet} is a Hopf algebra dual to Schmitt's matroid-minor Hopf algebra.
