We show that the restriction functor from oriented factor planar algebras to subfactor planar algebras admits a left adjoint, which we call the free oriented extension functor. We show that for any subfactor planar algebra realized as the standard invariant of a hyperfinite \rm{II}_1 subfactor, the projection category of the free oriented extension admits a realization as bimodules of the hyperfinite \rm{II}_{1} factor.
