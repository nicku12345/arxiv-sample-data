C. Amiot has classified the connected triangulated k-categories with finitely many isoclasses of indecomposables satisfying suitable hypotheses. We remark that her proof shows that these triangulated categories are determined by their underlying k-linear categories. We observe that if the connectedness assumption is dropped, the triangulated categories are still determined by their underlying k-categories together with the action of the suspension functor on the set of isoclasses of indecomposables.
