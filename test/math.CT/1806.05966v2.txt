In this article, some Differential Geometry is developed synthetically in a Modal Homotopy Type Theory. While Homotopy Type Theory is used to reason about general \infty-toposes, the "Modal" extension we are using here, is concerned with special \infty-toposes with the extra structure of an idempotent monad with some additional properties. On the type theory side, the extension is realized by adding well known axioms of a monadic modality. In the applications we have in mind, this monadic modality corresponds to monads exhibiting infinitesimal information of the objects of special \infty-toposes of spaces. There are two main lines of examples of these toposes, one containing smooth manifolds, the other algebraic varieties. Since we use Homotopy Type Theory, stacks from both of these worlds are naturally included in our discussion. We will make use of this in developing some new higher differential geometry. Much of the higher differential geometry in this article is aimed at making our construction of moduli spaces of G-structures and torsionfree G-structures possible in a useful way. As a basic example, this abstract construction of moduli spaces may be instantiated for a topos containing manifolds and the orthogonal group to give a construction of the moduli stack of Riemannian Metrics on a smooth manifold. The G-structures are developed along the lines of Urs Schreiber's Higher Cartan Geometry.
