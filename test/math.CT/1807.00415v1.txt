The main result is that the category of ordinary modules of an affine vertex operator algebra of a simply laced Lie algebra at admissible level is rigid and thus a braided fusion category. If the level satisfies a certain coprime property then it is even a modular tensor category. In all cases open Hopf links coincide with the corresponding normalized S-matrix entries of torus one-point functions. This is interpreted as a Verlinde formula beyond rational vertex operator algebras.   A preparatory Theorem is a convenient formula for the fusion rules of rational principal W-algebras of any type.
