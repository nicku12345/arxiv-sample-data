We introduce q-stability conditions (\sigma,s) on Calabi-Yau-\mathbb{X} categories \mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X}, where \sigma is a stability condition on \mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X} and s a complex number. We prove the corresponding deformation theorem, that \operatorname{QStab}_s\mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X} is a complex manifold of dimension n for fixed s, where n is the rank of the Grotendieck group of \mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X} over \mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm 1}]. When s=N is an integer, we show that the q-stability conditions can be identified with the stability conditions on \mathcal{D}_N, provided the orbit category \mathcal{D}_N=\mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X}/[\mathbb{X}-N] is well defined. To attack the questions on existence and deformation along s direction, we introduce the inducing method. Sufficient and necessary conditions are given, for a stability condition on an \mathbb{X}-baric heart (that is, an usual triangulated category) of \mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X} to induce q-stability conditions on \mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X}. As a consequence, we show that the space \operatorname{QStab}^\oplus\mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X} of (induced) open q-stability conditions is a complex manifold of dimension n+1.   Our motivating examples for \mathcal{D}_\mathbb{X} are coming from Calabi-Yau-\mathbb{X} completions of dg algebras. In the case of smooth projective varieties, the \mathbb{C}^*-equivariant coherent sheaves on canonical bundles provide the Calabi-Yau-\mathbb{X} categories. Another application is that we show the prefect derived categories can be realized as cluster-\mathbb{X} categories for acyclic quivers.
