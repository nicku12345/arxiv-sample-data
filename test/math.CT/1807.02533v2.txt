Given a representation of a unital C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} on a Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, together with a bounded linear map V:\mathcal{K}\to\mathcal{H} from some other Hilbert space, one obtains a completely positive map on \mathcal{A} via restriction using the adjoint action associated to V. We show this restriction forms a natural transformation from a functor of C^*-algebra representations to a functor of completely positive maps. We exhibit Stinespring's construction as a left adjoint of this restriction. Our Stinespring adjunction provides a universal property associated to minimal Stinespring dilations and morphisms of Stinespring dilations. We use these results to prove the purification postulate for all finite-dimensional C^*-algebras.
