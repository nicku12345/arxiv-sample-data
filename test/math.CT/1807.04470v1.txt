The aim of this paper is twofold. The first one is to explore the concept of conjugation for subgroupoids and to show, under certain finiteness conditions, the Burnside's analogue Theorem for groupoids. The second aim is to prove that there is a non canonical isomorphism of rings between the Burnside ring of a given groupoid and the product of the Burnside rings of its isotropy type groups. As a consequence of this we will examine the ghost map of a finite groupoid and the idempotents of its Burnside algebra. The exposition includes an Appendix where we gather the main general technical notions that are needed along the paper.
