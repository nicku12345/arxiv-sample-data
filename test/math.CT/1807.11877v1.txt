Let \mathscr{M} be a monoidal model category that is also combinatorial and left proper. If \mathscr{O} is a monad, operad, properad, or a PROP; following Segal's ideas we develop a theory of Quillen-Segal \mathscr{O}-algebras and show that we have a Quillen equivalence between usual \mathscr{O}-algebras and Quillen-Segal algebras. We use this theory to get the stable homotopy category by a similar method as Hovey.
