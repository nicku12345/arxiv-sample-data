We introduce a generalization of Joyce's motivic Hall algebra by combining it with Green's parabolic induction product, as well as a non-archimedean variant of it. In the construction, we follow Dyckerhoff-Kapranov's formalism of 2-Segal objects and their transferred algebra structures. Our main result is the existence of an integration map under any suitable transfer theory, of course including the (analytic) equivariant motivic one. This allows us to study Harder-Narasimhan recursion formulas in new cases.
