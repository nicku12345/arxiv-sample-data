We introduce and study the notion of affine varieties associated to ordered bases and establish Galois connection between the power set of A^n_K and the power set of K[x_1, . . ., x_n], and then induce a Galois correspondence. We generalize the idea by defining affine varieties associated to linear operators. We produce Hilbert's Nullstellensatz version for such varieties and show that there is a 1-1 correspondence between this kind of varieties in A^n_K and the "usual" affine varieties in A^n_K. We prove that the \usual" affine varieties forms a skeleton for the category of all affine varieties associated to linear operators, and hence they are equivalent categories.
