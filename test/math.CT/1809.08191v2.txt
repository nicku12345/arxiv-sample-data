By the Three Graces we refer, following J.-L. Loday, to the algebraic operads Ass, Com, and Lie, each generated by a single binary operation; algebras over these operads are respectively associative, commutative associative, and Lie. We classify all distributive laws (in the categorical sense of Beck) between these three operads. Some of our results depend on the computer algebra system Maple, especially its packages LinearAlgebra and Groebner.
