For each prime p, we define a t-structure on the category \widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}_{harm}^b of harmonic \mathbb{C}-motivic left module spectra over \widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau, whose MGL-homology has bounded Chow-Novikov degree, such that its heart is equivalent to the abelian category of p-completed BP_*BP-comodules that are concentrated in even degrees. We prove that \widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}_{harm}^b is equivalent to \mathcal{D}^b({{BP}_*{BP}\text{-}\mathbf{Comod}}^{{ev}}) as stable \infty-categories equipped with t-structures.   As an application, for each prime p, we prove that the motivic Adams spectral sequence for \widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau, which converges to the motivic homotopy groups of \widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau, is isomorphic to the algebraic Novikov spectral sequence, which converges to the classical Adams-Novikov E_2-page for the sphere spectrum \widehat{S^0}. This isomorphism of spectral sequences allows Isaksen and the second and third authors to compute the stable homotopy groups of spheres at least to the 90-stem, with ongoing computations into even higher dimensions.
