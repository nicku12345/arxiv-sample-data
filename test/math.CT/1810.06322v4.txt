In this article we study chains of torsion classes in an abelian category \mathcal{A}. We prove that chains of torsion classes induce a Harder-Narasimhan filtrations for every non-zero object M in \mathcal{A} and we characterise the slicings of \mathcal{A} in terms of chain of torsion classes. Later, we show that all chain of torsion classes form a topological space and we study some of its properties. We finish the paper by showing that wall-crossing formulas can be deduced from chain of torsion classes.
