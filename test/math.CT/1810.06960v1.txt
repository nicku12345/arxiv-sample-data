This paper is the first step in the project of categorifying the bialgebra structure on the half of quantum group U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}) by using geometry and Hall algebras. We equip the category of D-modules on the moduli stack of objects of the category Rep_{\mathbb{C}}(Q) of representations of a quiver with the structure of an algebra object in the category of stable \infty-categories. The data for this construction is provided by an extension of the Waldhausen construction for the category Rep_{\mathbb{C}}(Q). We discuss the connection to the Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier categorification of half of the quantum group U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}) associated to the quiver Q and outline our approach to the categorification of the bialgebra structure.
