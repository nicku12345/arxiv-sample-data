Green's theorem states that the Hall algebra of the category of representations of a quiver over a finite field is a twisted bialgebra. Considering instead categories of orthogonal or symplectic quiver representations leads to a class of modules over the Hall algebra, called Hall modules, which are also comodules. A module theoretic analogue of Green's theorem, describing the compatibility of the module and comodule structures, is not known. In this paper we prove module theoretic analogues of Green's theorem in the degenerate settings of finitary Hall modules of \mathsf{Rep}_{\mathbb{F}_1}(Q) and constructible Hall modules of \mathsf{Rep}_{\mathbb{C}}(Q). The result is that the module and comodule structures satisfy a compatibility condition reminiscent of that of a Yetter-Drinfeld module.
