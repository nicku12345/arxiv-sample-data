We define the notion of a 2-operad relative to an operad, and prove that the 2-associahedra form a 2-operad relative to the associahedra. Using this structure, we define the notions of an (A_\infty,2)-category and (A_\infty,2)-algebra in spaces and in chain complexes over a ring. Finally, we show that for any continuous map A \to X, we can associate an (A_\infty,2)-algebra \theta(A \to X) in \textsf{Top}, which specializes to \theta(\text{pt} \to X) = \Omega^2 X and \theta(A \to \text{pt}) = \Omega A \times \Omega A.
