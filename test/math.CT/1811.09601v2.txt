Given a family of model categories \cal E \to \cal C, we associate to it a homotopical category of derived, or Segal, sections DSect(\cal C,\cal E) that models the higher-categorical sections of the localisation L\cal E \to \cal C. The derived sections provide an alternative, strict model for various higher algebra objects appearing in the work of Lurie. We prove a few results concerning the properties of the homotopical category DSect(\cal C,\cal E), and as an example, study its behaviour with respect to the base-change along a select class of functors.
