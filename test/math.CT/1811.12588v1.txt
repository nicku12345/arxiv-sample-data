Let \mathcal{C} be a triangulated category with shift functor [1] and \mathcal{R} a rigid subcategory of \mathcal{C}. We introduce the notions of two-term \mathcal{R}[1]-rigid subcategories, two-term (weak) \mathcal{R}[1]-cluster tilting subcategories and two-term maximal \mathcal{R}[1]-rigid subcategories, and discuss relationship between them. Our main result shows that there exists a bijection between the set of two-term \mathcal{R}[1]-rigid subcategories of \mathcal{C} and the set of \tau-rigid subcategories of \mod\mathcal{R}, which induces a one-to-one correspondence between the set of two-term weak \mathcal{R}[1]-cluster tilting subcategories of \mathcal{C} and the set of support \tau-tilting subcategories of \mod\mathcal{R}. This generalizes the main results in \cite{YZZ} where \mathcal{R} is a cluster tilting subcategory. When \mathcal{R} is a silting subcategory, we prove that the two-term weak \mathcal{R}[1]-cluster tilting subcategories are precisely two-term silting subcategories in \cite{IJY}. Thus the bijection above induces the bijection given by Iyama-J{\o}rgensen-Yang in \cite{IJY}
