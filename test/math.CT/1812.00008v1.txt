This is a survey on the project `Decorated Marked Surfaces', where we introduce the decoration \Delta on a marked surfaces \mathbf{S}, to study Calabi-Yau-2 (cluster) categories, Calabi-Yau-3 (Fukaya) categories, braid groups for quivers with potential, quadratic differentials and stability conditions.
