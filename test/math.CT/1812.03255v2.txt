The degenerate Heisenberg category \mathcal{H}eis_k is a strict monoidal category which was originally introduced in the special case k=-1 by Khovanov in 2010. Khovanov conjectured that the Grothendieck ring of the additive Karoubi envelope of his category is isomorphic to a certain \mathbb{Z}-form for the universal enveloping algebra of the infinite-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra specialized at central charge -1. We prove this conjecture and extend it to arbitrary central charge k \in \mathbb{Z}. We also explain how to categorify the comultiplication (generically).
