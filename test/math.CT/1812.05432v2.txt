As groupoids generalize groups, motivated by group extensions we consider a kind of fibrations of Lie groupoids, called locally topological product Lie groupoid fibrations with fiber \sf A, i.e., \[ 1\rightarrow {\sf A} \rightarrow {\sf G} \rightarrow {\sf K}\rightarrow 1 \] where \sf A,\sf G and \sf K are Lie groupoids. Similar to the theory of group extensions, we show that the existence of locally topological product Lie groupoid fibrations with fiber \sf A over \sf K is obstructed by a groupoid cohomology of H^3_{\bar \Lambda}({\sf K},Z_{\sf A}), and these locally topological product Lie groupoid fibrations are classified by H^2_{\bar \Lambda}({\sf K},Z_{\sf A}) once exists. Here Z_{\sf A} is the center of \sf A. This generalizes the theory of group extensions, of gerbes over manifolds/groupoids and etc.
