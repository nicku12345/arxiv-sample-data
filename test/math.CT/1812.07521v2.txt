In fuzzy theory of sets and groups, the use of \alpha--levels is a standard to translate problems from the fuzzy to the crisp framework. Using strong \alpha--levels, it is possible to establish a one to one correspondence which makes possible doubly, a gradual and a functorial treatment of the fuzzy theory. The main result of this paper is to identify the class of fuzzy sets, respectively fuzzy groups, with subcategories of the functorial categories \mathcal{S}\textit{et}^{(0,1]}, resp. \mathcal{G}\textit{r}^{(0,1]}.
