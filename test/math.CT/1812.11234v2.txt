The definitions of the n^{th} Gauss sum and the associated n^{th} central charge are introduced for premodular categories \mathcal{C} and n\in\mathbb{Z}. We first derive an expression of the n^{th} Gauss sum of a modular category \mathcal{C}, for any integer n coprime to the order of the T-matrix of \mathcal{C}, in terms of the first Gauss sum, the global dimension, the twist and their Galois conjugates. As a consequence, we show for these n, the higher Gauss sums are d-numbers and the associated central charges are roots of unity. In particular, if \mathcal{C} is the Drinfeld center of a spherical fusion category, then these higher central charges are 1. We obtain another expression of higher Gauss sums for de-equivariantization and local module constructions of appropriate premodular and modular categories. These expressions are then applied to prove the Witt invariance of higher central charges for pseudounitary modular categories.
