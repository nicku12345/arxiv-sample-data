In previous work, we develop a generalized Waldhausen S_{\bullet}-construction whose input is an augmented stable double Segal space and whose output is a unital 2-Segal space. Here, we prove that this construction recovers the previously known S_{\bullet}-constructions for exact categories and for stable and exact (\infty,1)-categories, as well as the relative S_{\bullet}-construction for exact functors.
