We study induced model structures on Frobenius categories. In particular we consider the case where \mathcal{C} is the category of comodules of a supercommutative Hopf algebra A over a field k. Given a graded Hopf algebra quotient A \to B satisfying some finiteness conditions, the Frobenius tensor category \mathcal{D} of graded B-comodules with its stable model structure induces a monoidal model structure on \mathcal{C}. We consider the corresponding homotopy quotient \gamma: \mathcal{C} \to Ho \mathcal{C} and the induced quotient \mathcal{T} \to Ho \mathcal{T} for the tensor category \mathcal{T} of finite dimensional A-comodules. Under some mild conditions we prove vanishing and finiteness theorems for morphisms in Ho \mathcal{T}. We apply these results in the Rep (GL(m|n))-case and study its homotopy category Ho \mathcal{T}.
