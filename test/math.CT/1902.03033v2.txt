In this paper, first we introduce the notion of a Leibniz bialgebra and show that matched pairs of Leibniz algebras, Manin triples of Leibniz algebras and Leibniz bialgebras are equivalent. Then we introduce the notion of a (relative) Rota-Baxter operator on a Leibniz algebra and construct the graded Lie algebra that characterizes relative Rota-Baxter operators as Maurer-Cartan elements. By these structures and the twisting theory of twilled Leibniz algebras, we further define the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation, classical Leibniz r-matrices and triangular Leibniz bialgebras. Finally, we construct solutions of the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation using relative Rota-Baxter operators and Leibniz-dendriform algebras.
