The goal of this paper is to associate functorially to every symmetric monoidal additive category \mathbf{A} with a strict G-action a lax symmetric monoidal functor \mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{A}}^{G}:G\mathbf{BornCoarse}\to \mathbf{Add}_{\infty} from the symmetric monoidal category of G-bornological coarse spaces G\mathbf{BornCoarse} to the symmetric monoidal \infty-category of additive categories  \mathbf{Add}_{\infty}. This allows to refine equivariant coarse algebraic K-homology to a lax symmetric monoidal functor.
