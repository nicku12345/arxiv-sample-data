We study smashing subcategories of a triangulated category with coproducts via silting theory. Our main result states that for derived categories of dg modules over a non-positive differential graded ring, every compactly generated localising subcategory is generated by a partial silting object. In particular, every such smashing subcategory admits a silting t-structure.
