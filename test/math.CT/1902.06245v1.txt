For a Green biset functor A, we define the commutant and the center of A and we study some of their properties and their relationship. This leads in particular to the main application of these constructions: the possibility of splitting the category of A-modules as a direct product of smaller abelian categories. We give explicit examples of such decompositions for some classical shifted representation functors. These constructions are inspired by similar ones for Mackey functors for a fixed finite group.
