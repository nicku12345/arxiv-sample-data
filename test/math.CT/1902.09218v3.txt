A \mathcal G-system is a collection of \mathbb Z-bases of \mathbb Z^n with some extra axiomatic conditions. There are two kinds of actions "mutations" and "co-Bongartz completions" naturally acting on a \mathcal G-system, which provide the combinatorial structure of a \mathcal G-system. It turns out that "co-Bongartz completions" have good compatibility with "mutations".   The constructions of "mutations" are known before in different contexts, including cluster tilting theory, silting theory, \tau-tilting theory, cluster algebras, marked surfaces. We found that in addition to "mutations", there exists another kind of actions "co-Bongartz completions" naturally appearing in these different theories. With the help of "co-Bongartz completions" some good combinatorial results can be easily obtained. In this paper, we give the constructions of "co-Bongartz completions" in different theories. Then we show that \mathcal G-systems naturally arise from these theories, and the "mutations" and "co-Bongartz completions" in different theories are compatible with those in \mathcal G-systems.
