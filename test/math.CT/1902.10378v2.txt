We consider colored operads and their actions on categories. As a special example we construct a cobordism category with a colored operad action arising from oriented planar arc diagrams. This is used to construct an invariant of oriented tangle diagrams with values in the homotopy category attached to the cobordism category. Motivated by Bar-Natan's categorification of the Jones polynomial, it categorifies the quantum sl_n quantum invariants and is adapted to the categorification of the sl_n quantum invariants by Khovanov and Rozansky using matrix factorizations. We conjecture to exist the consistency of the cobordism category and to have an explicit functor from the cobordism category to a category of matrix factorizations.
