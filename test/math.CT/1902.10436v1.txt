In this paper we study classical deformations of diagrams of commutative algebras over a field of characteristic 0. In particular we determine several homotopy classes of DG-Lie algebras, each one of them controlling this above deformation problem: the first homotopy type is described in terms of the projective model structure on the category of diagrams of differential graded algebras, the others in terms of the Reedy model structure on truncated Bousfield-Kan approximations. The first half of the paper contains an elementary introduction to the projective model structure on the category of commutative differential graded algebras, while the second half is devoted to the main results.
