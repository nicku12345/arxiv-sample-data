The characteristic feature of the adeles is that they involve localizations of products (or equivalently restricted products of localizations). The point of this paper is to introduce an adelic style cohomological invariant of a partially ordered set with auxiliary structure which covers several examples of established interest in commutative algebra and stable equivariant homotopy theory.
