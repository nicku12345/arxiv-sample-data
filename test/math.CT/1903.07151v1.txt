This paper extends the notion of B-group to a relative context. For a finite group K and a field \mathbb{F} of characteristic 0, the lattice of ideals of the Green biset functor \mathbb{F}B_K obtained by shifting the Burnside functor \mathbb{F}B by K is described in terms of {\em B_K-groups}. It is shown that any finite group (L,\varphi) over K admits a {\em largest quotient B_K-group} \beta_K(L,\varphi). The simple subquotients of \mathbb{F}B_K are parametrized by B_K-groups, and their evaluations can be precisely determined. Finally, when p is a prime, the restriction \mathbb{F}B_K^{(p)} of \mathbb{F}B_K to finite p-groups is considered, and the structure of the lattice of ideals of the Green functor \mathbb{F}B_K^{(p)} is described in full detail. In particular, it is shown that this lattice is always finite.
