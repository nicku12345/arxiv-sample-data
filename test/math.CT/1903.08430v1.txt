Let G be a finite group, and C be an abelian group. We introduce the notions of C-monomial G-sets and C-monomial G-posets, and state some of their categorical properties. This gives in particular a new description of the C-monomial Burnside ring B_C(G). We also introduce Lefschetz invariants of C-monomial G-posets, which are elements of B_C(G). These invariants allow for a definition of a generalized tensor induction multiplicative map \mathcal{T}_{U,\lambda}: B_C(G)\to B_C(H) associated to any C-monomial (G,H)-biset (U,\lambda), which in turn gives a group homomorphism B_C(G)^\times\to B_C(H)^\times between the unit groups of C-monomial Burnside rings.
