The present article exploits the fact that permutads (aka shuffle algebras) are algebras over a terminal operad in a certain operadic category Per. In the first, classical part we formulate and prove a claim envisaged by Loday and Ronco that the cellular chains of the permutohedra form the minimal model of the terminal permutad which is moreover, in the sense we define, self-dual and Koszul. In the second part we study Koszulity of Per-operads. Among other things we prove that the terminal Per-operad is Koszul self-dual. We then describe strongly homotopy permutads as algebras of its minimal model. Our paper shall advertise analogous future results valid in general operadic categories, and the prominent role of operadic (op)fibrations in the related theory.
