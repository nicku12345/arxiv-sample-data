We study the approximately finite-dimensional (AF) C^*-algebras that appear as inductive limits of sequences of finite-dimensional C^*-algebras and left-invertible embeddings. We show that there is such a separable AF-algebra \mathcal A_\mathfrak{F} with the property that any separable AF-algebra is isomorphic to a quotient of \mathcal A_\mathfrak{F}. Equivalently, by Elliott's classification of separable AF-algebras, there are surjectively universal countable scaled (or with order-unit) dimension groups. This universality is a consequence of our result stating that \mathcal A_\mathfrak{F} is the Fra\"\i ss\'e limit of the category of all finite-dimensional C^*-algebras and left-invertible embeddings.   With the help of Fra\"\i ss\'e theory we describe the Bratteli diagram of \mathcal A_\mathfrak{F} and provide conditions characterizing it up to isomorphisms. \mathcal A_\mathfrak{F} belongs to a class of separable AF-algebras which are all Fra\"\i ss\'e limits of suitable categories of finite-dimensional C^*-algebras, and resemble C(2^\mathbb N) in many senses. For instance, they have no minimal projections, tensorially absorb C(2^\mathbb N) (i.e. they are C(2^\mathbb N)-stable) and satisfy similar homogeneity and universality properties as the Cantor set.
