Let \mathcal{C} be a finite tensor category, and let \mathcal{M} be an exact left \mathcal{C}-module category. A relative Serre functor of \mathcal{M}, introduced by Fuchs, Schaumann and Schweigert, is an endofunctor \mathbb{S} on \mathcal{M} together with a natural isomorphism \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M, N)^* \cong \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(N, \mathbb{S}(M)) for M, N \in \mathcal{M}, where \underline{\mathrm{Hom}} is the internal Hom functor of \mathcal{M}. In this paper, we discuss the case where \mathcal{C} = {}_H \mathfrak{M} and \mathcal{M} = {}_L \mathfrak{M} for a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H and a finite-dimensional exact left H-comodule algebra L. We give an explicit description of a relative Serre functor of {}_L \mathfrak{M} and its twisted module structure in terms of integrals of H and the Frobenius structure of L. We also study pivotal structures on {}_L \mathfrak{M} and give some explicit examples.
