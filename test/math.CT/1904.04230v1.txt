We examine Hopf cyclic cohomology in the same context as the analysis of the geometry of loop spaces LX in derived algebraic geometry and the resulting close relationship between S^1-equivariant quasi-coherent sheaves on LX and D_X-modules. Furthermore, the Hopf setting serves as a toy case for the categorification of Chern character theory. More precisely, this examination naturally leads to a definition of mixed anti-Yetter-Drinfeld contramodules which reduces to that of the usual mixed complexes for the trivial Hopf algebra and generalizes the notion of stable anti-Yetter-Drinfeld contramodules that have thus far served as the coefficients for Hopf-cyclic theories. The cohomology is then obtained as a Hom in this dg-category between a Chern character object associated to an algebra and an arbitrary coefficient mixed anti-Yetter-Drinfeld contramodule.
