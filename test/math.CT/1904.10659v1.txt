Given a Henselian and Japanese discrete valuation ring A and a flat and projective A-scheme X, we follow the approach of Biswas-dos Santos to introduce a full subcategory of coherent modules on X which is then shown to be Tannakian. We then prove that, under normality of the generic fibre, the associated affine and flat group is pro-finite in a strong sense (so that its ring of functions is a Mittag-Leffler A-module) and that it classifies finite torsors Q\to X. This establishes an analogy to Nori's theory of the essentially finite fundamental group. In addition, we compare our theory with the ones recently developed by Mehta-Subramanian and Antei-Emsalem-Gasbarri. Using the comparison with the former, we show that any quasi-finite torsor Q\to X has a reduction of structure group to a finite one.
