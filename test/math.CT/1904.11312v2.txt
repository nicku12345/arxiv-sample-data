We define (iterated) coisotropic correspondences between derived Poisson stacks, and construct symmetric monoidal higher categories of derived Poisson stacks where the i-morphisms are given by i-fold coisotropic correspondences. Assuming an expected equivalence of different models of higher Morita categories, we prove that all derived Poisson stacks are fully dualizable, and so determine framed extended TQFTs by the Cobordism Hypothesis. Along the way we also prove that the higher Morita category of E_{n}-algebras with respect to coproducts is equivalent to the higher category of iterated cospans.
