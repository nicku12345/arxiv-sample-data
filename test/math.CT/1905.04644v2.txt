In this work, for a finite group G and a 4-cocycle \omega \in Z^4(G, \mathbf{k}^\times), we compute explicitly the center of the monoidal 2-category \operatorname{2Vec}_G^{\omega} of \omega-twisted G-graded 1-categories of finite dimensional \mathbf{k}-vector spaces. This center gives a precise mathematical description of the topological defects in the associated 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT. We prove that this center is a braided monoidal 2-category with a trivial sylleptic center.
