For a commutative ring S and self-orthogonal subcategory \mathsf{C} of \mathsf{Mod}(S), we consider matrix factorizations whose modules belong to \mathsf{C}. Let f\in S be a regular element. If f is M-regular for every M\in \mathsf{C}, we show there is a natural embedding of the homotopy category of \mathsf{C}-factorizations of f into a corresponding homotopy category of totally acyclic complexes. Moreover, we prove this is an equivalence if \mathsf{C} is the category of projective or flat-cotorsion S-modules. Dually, using divisibility in place of regularity, we observe there is a parallel equivalence when \mathsf{C} is the category of injective S-modules.
