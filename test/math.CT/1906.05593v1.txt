We develop a denotational semantics of Linear Logic with least and greatest fixed points in coherence spaces (where both fixed points are interpreted in the same way) and in coherence spaces with totality (where they have different interpretations). These constructions can be carried out in many different denotational models of LL (hypercoherences, Scott semantics, finiteness spaces etc). We also present a natural embedding of G{\"o}del System T in LL with fixed points thus enforcing the expressive power of this system as a programming language featuring both normalization and a huge expressive power in terms of data types.
