Standard results from non-abelian cohomology theory specialize to a theory of torsors and stacks for cosimplicial groupoids. The space of global sections of the stack completion of a cosimplicial groupoid G is weakly equivalent to the Bousfield-Kan total complex of BG for all cosimplicial groupoids G. The k-invariants for the Postnikov tower of a cosimplicial space X are naturally elements of stack cohomology for the stack associated to the fundamental groupoid \pi(X) of X. Cocycle-theoretic ideas and techniques are used throughout the paper.
