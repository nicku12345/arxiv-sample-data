We classify irreducible unitary representations of the group of all infinite matrices over a p-adic field (p\ne 2) with integer elements   equipped with a natural topology. Any irreducible representation passes through a group GL of infinite matrices over a residue ring modulo p^k. Irreducible representations of the latter group are induced from finite-dimensional representations of certain open subgroups.
