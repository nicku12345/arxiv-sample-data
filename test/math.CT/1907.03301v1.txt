We introduce a new way to encode semicyclic structures using a stack of broken cycles. (We also prove an analogue for paracyclic structures.) This was motivated not only by higher algebra but also by Fukaya-categorical considerations.   We also openly speculate about some Fukaya-categorical implications. For example, this stack sees moduli of stopped Liouville disks, and hence yields another platform for gluing together Fukaya categories. We also see that Lagrangian cobordisms with multiple ends may not only serve to detect K_0 groups of Fukaya categories, but higher K-theory groups as well.   Along the way, we include brief expositions of (i) basic techniques in infinity-categories and (ii) the translation between exit path categories and constructible sheaves. These may be of independent interest.
