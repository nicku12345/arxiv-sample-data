A t-structure t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0}) on a triangulated category C is right adjacent to a weight structure w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0}) if C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}; then t can be uniquely recovered from w and vice versa. We prove that if C satisfies the Brown representability property then t that is adjacent to w exists if and only if w is smashing (i.e., coproducts respect weight decompositions); then the heart Ht is the category of those functors Hw^{op}\to Ab that respect products. The dual to this statement is related to results of B. Keller and P. Nicolas. We also prove that an adjacent t exists whenever w is a bounded weight structure on a saturated R-linear category C (for a noetherian ring R); for C=D^{perf}(X), where the scheme X is regular and proper over R, this gives 1-to-1 correspondences between bounded weights structures on C and the classes of those bounded t-structures on it such that Ht has either enough projectives or injectives. We generalize this existence statement to construct (under certain assumptions) a t-structure t on a triangulated category C' such that C and C' are subcategories of a common triangulated category D and t is right orthogonal to w. In particular, if X is proper over R but not necessarily regular then one can take C=D^{perf}(X), C'=D^b_{coh}(X) or C'=D^-_{coh}(X), and D=D_{qc}(X). We also study hearts of orthogonal t-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal t-structures. The main tool of this paper are virtual t-truncations of (cohomological) functors; these are defined in terms of weight structures and "behave as if they come from t-truncations" whether t exists or not.
