We generalize the notion of a bornology by omitting the condition that a one-point-subset is bounded and obtain a complete and co-complete generalization of the category of bornological coarse spaces. Then we imitate the construction of motivic coarse spectra in this new setting and show that the inclusion functor from the category of bornological coarse spaces to its generalization induces an equivalence of motivic coarse spectra. In particular, for any stable co-complete \infty-category C, it induces an equivalence between the category of C-valued coarse homology theories on bornological coarse spaces and the category of C-valued coarse homology theories on generalized bornological coarse spaces.
