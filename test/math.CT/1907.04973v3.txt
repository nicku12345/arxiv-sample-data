Under mild assumptions, we construct the two Matlis additive category equivalences for an associative ring epimorphism u\colon R\to U. Assuming that the ring epimorphism is homological of flat/projective dimension 1, we discuss the abelian categories of u-comodules and u-contramodules and construct the recollement of unbounded derived categories of R-modules, U-modules, and complexes of R-modules with u-co/contramodule cohomology. Further assumptions allow to describe the third category in the recollement as the unbounded derived category of the abelian categories of u-comodules and u-contramodules. For commutative rings, we also prove that any homological epimorphism of projective dimension 1 is flat. Injectivity of the map u is not required.
