Silting and Calabi-Yau reductions are important process in representation theory to construct new triangulated categories from given one, which are similar to Verdier quotient. In this paper, first we introduce a new reduction process of triangulated category, which is analogous to the silting (Calabi-Yau) reduction. For a triangulated category \cal T with a pre-simple-minded collection (=pre-SMC) \cal R, we construct a new triangulated category \cal U such that the SMCs in \cal U bijectively correspond to those in \cal T containing \cal R. Secondly, we give an analogue of Buchweitz's theorem for the singularity category \cal T_{\rm sg} of a SMC quadruple (\cal T,\cal T^{\rm p},\mathbb S, \cal S): the category \cal T_{\rm sg} can be realized as the stable category of an extriangulated subcategory \cal F of \cal T. Finally, we show the SMS (simple-minded system) reduction due to Coelho Sim\~oes and Pauksztello is the shadow of our SMC reduction. This is parallel to the result that Calabi-Yau reduction is the shadow of silting reduction due to Iyama and Yang.
