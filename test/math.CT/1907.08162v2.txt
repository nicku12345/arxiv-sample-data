We prove that for any finite-dimensional differential graded algebra with separable semisimple part the category of perfect modules is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category of perfect complexes on a smooth projective scheme with a full separable semi-exceptional collection. Moreover, we also show that it gives a characterization of such categories assuming that a subcategory is idempotent complete and has a classical generator.
