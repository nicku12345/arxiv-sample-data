We utilize category theory to define non-commutative disintegrations, regular conditional probabilities, and optimal hypotheses for finite-dimensional C*-algebras. In the process, we introduce a notion of a.e. equivalence for positive maps and show that the category of C*-algebras and a.e. equivalence classes of 2-positive unital maps forms a category. A related result holds for positive unital maps on von Neumann algebras. In the special case of a finite-dimensional commutative C*-algebra, this reproduces the usual notions of a.e. equivalence and a disintegration of a probability measure over another measure consistent with a probability-preserving function. Similar to the commutative (measure-theoretic) case, disintegrations are unique almost everywhere whenever they exist. However, in contrast to the commutative case, there are many instances where such disintegrations do not exist. We show a certain separability condition on the density matrices representing the states is necessary and sufficient for the existence and uniqueness of such disintegration on finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Physically, tracing out degrees of freedom from the environment of a quantum system is one example of a state-preserving *-homomorphism and the disintegration is the optimal reversal of this procedure. Finally, we discuss some implications for quantum measurement.
