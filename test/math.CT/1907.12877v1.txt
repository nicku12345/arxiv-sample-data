Let k be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic p, and \mathbb{F} be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We consider the \mathbb{F}-linear category \mathbb{F} pp_k^\Delta of finite groups, in which the set of morphisms from G to H is the \mathbb{F}-linear extension \mathbb{F} T^\Delta(H,G) of the Grothendieck group T^\Delta(H,G) of p-permutation (kH,kG)-bimodules with (twisted) diagonal vertices. The \mathbb{F}-linear functors from \mathbb{F} pp_k^\Delta to \mathbb{F}\hbox{-Mod} are called {\em diagonal p-permutation functors}. They form an abelian category \mathcal{F}_{pp_k}^\Delta.   We study in particular the functor \mathbb{F}T^{\Delta} sending a finite group G to the Grothendieck group \mathbb{F}T(G) of p-permutation kG-modules, and show that \mathbb{F}T^\Delta is a semisimple object of \mathcal{F}_{pp_k}^\Delta, equal to the direct sum of specific simple functors parametrized by isomorphism classes of pairs (P,s) of a finite p-group P and a generator s of a p'-subgroup acting faithfully on P. This leads to a precise description of the evaluations of these simple functors. In particular, we show that the simple functor indexed by the trivial pair (1,1) is isomorphic to the functor sending a finite group G to \mathbb{F} K_0(kG), where K_0(kG) is the group of projective kG-modules.
