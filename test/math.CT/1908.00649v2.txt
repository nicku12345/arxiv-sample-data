Starting with a Grothendieck category \mathcal{G} and a torsion pair \mathbf{t}=(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F}) in \mathcal G, we study the local finite presentability and local coherence of the heart \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}} of the associated Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} t-structure in the derived category \mathrm{Der} (\mathcal{G}). We start by showing that, in this general setting, the torsion pair \mathbf t is of finite type, if and only if it is quasi-cotilting, if and only if it is cosilting. We then proceed to study those \mathbf t for which \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}} is locally finitely presented, obtaining a complete answer under some additional assumptions on the ground category \mathcal{G}, which are general enough to include all locally coherent categories, all categories of modules and several categories of quasi-coherent sheaves over schemes. The third problem that we tackle is that of local coherence. In this direction we characterize those torsion pairs \mathbf t=(\mathcal T,\mathcal F) in a locally finitely presented \mathcal G for which \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}} is locally coherent in two cases: when the tilted t-structure in \mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}} is assumed to restrict to finitely presented objects, and when \mathcal F is cogenerating. In the last part of the paper we concentrate on the case when \mathcal G is a category of modules over a small preadditive category, giving several examples and obtaining very neat (new) characterizations even in this more classical setting, also underlying connections with the notion of an elementary cogenerator.
