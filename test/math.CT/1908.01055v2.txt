In this paper, we consider the polymodal version of Lambek calculus with subexponential modalities initially introduced by Kanovich, Kuznetsov, Nigam, and Scedrov and its quantale semantics. In our approach, subexponential modalities have an interpretation in terms of quantic conuclei. We show that this extension of Lambek calculus is complete w.r.t quantales with quantic conuclei. Also, we prove a representation theorem for quantales with quantic conuclei and show that Lambek calculus with subexponentials is relationally complete. Finally, we extend this representation theorem to the category of quantales with quantic conuclei.
