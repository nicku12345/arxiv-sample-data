We generalize the K matrix formulation to non-trivial non-Abelian families of 2+1D topological orders. Given a topological order \mathcal C, any topological order in the same non-Abelian family as \mathcal C can be efficiently described by \boldsymbol{a}=(a_I) where a_I are Abelian anyons in \mathcal C, together with a symmetric invertible matrix K, K_{IJ}=k_{IJ}-t_{a_I,a_J} where k_{IJ} are integers, k_{II} are even and t_{a_I,a_J} are the mutual statistics between a_I,a_J. In particular, when \mathcal C is a root whose rank is the smallest in the family, K becomes an integer matrix. Our results make it possible to generate the data of large numbers of topological orders instantly.
