We investigate the Jordan-H\"older property (JHP) in exact categories. First we introduce Grothendieck monoids of exact categories, and show that (JHP) holds if and only if the Grothendieck monoid is free. Moreover, we give a criterion for this which only uses the Grothendieck group and the number of simple objects. Next we apply these results to the representation theory of artin algebras. For a large class of exact categories including functorially finite torsion(-free) classes, (JHP) holds precisely when the number of indecomposable projectives is equal to that of simples. We study torsion-free classes in a quiver of type A in detail using the combinatorics of symmetric groups. In particular, we show that simples correspond to Bruhat inversions of a c-sortable element, and give the combinatorial criterion for (JHP).
