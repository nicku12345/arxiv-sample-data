The injective spectrum is a topological space associated to a ring R, which agrees with the Zariski spectrum when R is commutative noetherian. We consider injective spectra of right noetherian rings (and locally noetherian Grothendieck categories) and establish some basic topological results and a functoriality result, as well as links between the topology and the Krull dimension of the ring (in the sense of Gabriel and Rentschler). Finally, we use these results to compute a number of examples.
