This is the second of two papers on the injective spectrum of a right noetherian ring. In the prequel, we considered the injective spectrum as a topological space associated to a ring (or, more generally, a Grothendieck category), which generalises the Zariski spectrum. We established some results about the topology and its links with Krull dimension, and computed a number of examples. In the present paper, which can largely be read independently of the first, we extend these results by defining a sheaf of rings on the injective spectrum and considering sheaves of modules over this structure sheaf and their relation to modules over the original ring. We then explore links with the spectrum of prime torsion theories developed by Golan and use this torsion-theoretic viewpoint to prove further results about the topology.
