For a monoid M, we denote by \mathbb G(M) the group of units, \mathbb E(M) the submonoid generated by the idempotents, and \mathbb G_L(M) and \mathbb G_R(M) the submonoids consisting of all left or right units. Writing \mathcal M for the (monoidal) category of monoids, \mathbb G, \mathbb E, \mathbb G_L and \mathbb G_R are all (monoidal) functors \mathcal M\to\mathcal M. There are other natural functors associated to submonoids generated by combinations of idempotents and one- or two-sided units. The above functors generate a monoid with composition as its operation. We show that this monoid has size 15, and describe its algebraic structure. We also show how to associate certain lattice invariants to a monoid, and classify the lattices that arise in this fashion. A number of examples are discussed throughout, some of which are essential for the proofs of the main theoretical results.
