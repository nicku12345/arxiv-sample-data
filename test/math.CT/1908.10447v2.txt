We generalize the results of "Networks of open systems" by the first author to the setting of hybrid systems. In particular we introduce the notions of hybrid open systems, their networks and maps between networks. A network of systems is a blueprint for building a larger system out of smaller subsystems by specifying a pattern of interactions between subsystems --- an interconnection map. Maps between networks allow us to produce maps between complex hybrid dynamical systems by specifying maps between their subsystems
