We study finiteness conditions in Grothendieck categories by introducing the concepts of objects of type \text{FP}_n and studying their closure properties with respect to short exact sequences. This allows us to propose a notion of locally type \text{FP}_n categories as a generalization of locally finitely generated and locally finitely presented categories. We also define and study the injective objects that are Ext-orthogonal to the class of objects of type \text{FP}_n, called \text{FP}_n-injective objects, which will be the right half of a complete cotorsion pair.   As a generalization of the category of modules over an n-coherent ring, we present the concept of n-coherent categories, which also recovers the notions of locally noetherian and locally coherent categories for n = 0, 1. Such categories will provide a setting in which the \text{FP}_n-injective cotorsion pair is hereditary, and where it is possible to construct (pre)covers by \text{FP}_n-injective objects. Moreover, we see how n-coherent categories provide a suitable framework for a nice theory of Gorenstein homological algebra with respect to the class of \text{FP}_n-injective modules. We define Gorenstein \text{FP}_n-injective objects and construct two different model category structures (one abelian and the other one exact) in which these Gorenstein objects are the fibrant objects.
