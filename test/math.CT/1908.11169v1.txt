We give a leisurely introduction to our abstract framework for operational semantics based on cellular monads on transition categories. Furthermore, we relate it for the first time to an existing format, by showing that all Positive GSOS specifications generate cellular monads whose free algebras are all compositional. As a consequence, we recover the known result that bisimilarity is a congruence in the generated labelled transition system.
