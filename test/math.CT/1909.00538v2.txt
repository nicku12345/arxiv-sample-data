We present a framework for studying the dynamics of equivariant vector fields near relative equilibria. To overcome the lack of linearization at a relative equilibrium or the possible non-smoothness of the orbit space, we categorify the space of equivariant vector fields. A category where the objects are equivariant vector fields was first introduced by Hepworth in the context of smooth stacks [Hepworth, Theory Appl. Categ. 22 (2009), 542-587]. Central to our approach is the ensuing notion of isomorphic equivariant vector fields. The idea is that considering equivariant vector fields, and their corresponding dynamics, up to isomorphism is a way to take into account the symmetries of the group action without passing to the orbit space. In particular, the category of equivariant vector fields near a relative equilibrium is equivalent to the category of equivariant vector fields on the slice representation of the relative equilibrium. In this paper we apply this to bifurcations to and from relative equilibria, and to the genericity of conditions for equivariant bifurcation from relative equilibria.
