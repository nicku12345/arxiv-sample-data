Many categorical frameworks have been proposed to formalize the idea of gluing Petri nets with each other. Such frameworks model net gluings in terms of sharing of resources or synchronization of transitions. Interpretations given to these gluings are more or less satisfactory when we consider Petri nets with a semantics attached to them.   In this work, we define a framework to compose Petri nets together in such a way that their semantics is respected. In addition to this, we show how our framework generalizes the previously defined ones.
