Consider a tree \mathbb T, all whose vertices have countable valence; its boundary is the Baire space \mathbb{B} \simeq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb N}; continued fractions expansions identify the set of irrational numbers \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q} with \mathbb B. Removing k edges from \mathbb T we get a forest consisting of copies of \mathbb T. A spheromorphism (or hierarchomorphism) of \mathbb T is an isomorphisms of two such subforests considered as a transformation of \mathbb T or of \mathbb B. Denote the group of all spheromorphisms by \mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T}). We a show that the correspondence {\mathbb R}\setminus{\mathbb Q}\simeq{\mathbb B} sends the Thompson group realized by piecewise \mathrm{PSL}_2({\mathbb Z})-transformations to a subgroup of \mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T}). We construct some unitary representations of the group \mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T}), show that the group of automorphisms \mathrm{Aut}({\mathbb T}) is spherical in \mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T}), and describe the train (enveloping category) of \mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T}).
