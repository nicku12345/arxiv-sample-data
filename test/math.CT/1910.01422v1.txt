Given a double cover \pi: \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \hat{\mathcal{G}} of finite groupoids, we explicitly construct twisted loop transgression maps, \tau_{\pi} and \tau_{\pi}^{ref}, thereby associating to a Jandl n-gerbe \hat{\lambda} on \hat{\mathcal{G}} a Jandl (n-1)-gerbe \tau_{\pi}(\hat{\lambda}) on the quotient loop groupoid of \mathcal{G} and an ordinary (n-1)-gerbe \tau^{ref}_{\pi}(\hat{\lambda}) on the unoriented quotient loop groupoid of \mathcal{G}. For n =1,2, we interpret the character theory (resp. centre) of the category of Real \hat{\lambda}-twisted n-vector bundles over \hat{\mathcal{G}} in terms of flat sections of the (n-1)-vector bundle associated to \tau_{\pi}^{ref}(\hat{\lambda}) (resp. the Real (n-1)-vector bundle associated to \tau_{\pi}(\hat{\lambda})). We relate our results to Real versions of twisted Drinfeld doubles and pointed fusion categories and to discrete torsion in orientifold string and M-theory.
