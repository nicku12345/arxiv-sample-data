We study the Geometric Langlands Conjecture (GLC) for rank two flat bundles on the projective line C with tame ramification at five points \{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5} \}. In particular we construct the automorphic D-modules predicted by GLC on the moduli space of rank two parabolic bundles on (C, \{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5} \}). The construction uses non-abelian Hodge theory and a Fourier-Mukai transform along the fibers of the Hitchin fibration to reduce the problem to one in classical projective geometry on the intersection of two quadrics in \mathbb{P}^{4}.
