In this article, we study the relationship among maximal green sequences, complete forward hom-orthogonal sequences and stability functions in abelian length categories. Mainly, we firstly give a one-to-one correspondence between maximal green sequences and complete forward hom-orthogonal sequences via mutual constructions, and then prove that a maximal green sequence can be induced by a central charge if and only if it satisfies crossing inequalities. As applications, we show that crossing inequalities can be computed by c-vectors for finite dimensional algebras; finally, we give the Rotation Lemma for finite dimensional Jacobian algebras.
