A modeloid, a certain set of partial bijections, emerges from the idea to abstract from a structure to the set of its partial automorphisms. It comes with an operation, called the derivative, which is inspired by Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games. In this paper we develop a generalization of a modeloid first to an inverse semigroup and then to an inverse category using an axiomatic approach to category theory. We then show that this formulation enables a purely algebraic view on Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games.
