We introduce a theory of stratifications of noncommutative stacks (i.e. presentable stable \infty-categories), and we prove a reconstruction theorem that expresses them in terms of their strata and gluing data. This reconstruction theorem is compatible with symmetric monoidal structures, and with more general operadic structures such as E_n-monoidal structures. We also provide a suite of fundamental operations for constructing new stratifications from old ones: restriction, pullback, quotient, pushforward, and refinement. Moreover, we establish a dual form of reconstruction, which is closely related to reflection functors and Verdier duality.   Our main application is to equivariant stable homotopy theory: for any compact Lie group G, we give a symmetric monoidal stratification of genuine G-spectra, that expresses them in terms of their geometric fixedpoints (as homotopy-equivariant spectra) and gluing data therebetween (which are given by proper Tate constructions).   We also prove an adelic reconstruction theorem; this applies not just to ordinary schemes but in the more general context of tensor-triangular geometry, where we obtain a symmetric monoidal stratification over the Balmer spectrum. We discuss the particular example of chromatic homotopy theory: the adelic stratification of the \infty-category of spectra.
