We consider the category \operatorname{Qcoh}\mathbb{X} of quasicoherent sheaves where \mathbb{X} is a weighted noncommutative regular projective curve over a field k. This category is a hereditary, locally noetherian Grothendieck category. We classify all indecomposable pure-injective sheaves and all cotilting sheaves of slope \infty. In the cases of nonnegative orbifold Euler characteristic this leads to a classification of pure-injective indecomposable sheaves and a description of all large cotilting sheaves in \operatorname{Qcoh}\mathbb{X}.
