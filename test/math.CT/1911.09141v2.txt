We introduce the notion of a partial corepresentation of a given Hopf algebra H over a coalgebra C and the closely related concept of a partial H-comodule. We prove that there exists a universal coalgebra H^{par}, associated to the original Hopf algebra H, such that the category of regular partial H-comodules is isomorphic to the category of H^{par}-comodules. We introduce the notion of a Hopf coalgebroid and show that the universal coalgebra H^{par} has the structure of a Hopf coalgebroid over a suitable coalgebra.
