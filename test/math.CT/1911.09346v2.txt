In Enochs' relative homological dimension theory occur the so called (co)resolvent and (co)proper dimensions which are defined using proper and coproper resolutions constructed by precovers and preenvelopes, respectively. Recently, some authors have been interested in relative homological dimensions defined by just exact sequences. In this paper, we contribute to the investigation of these relative homological dimensions. We first study the relation between these two kinds of relative homological dimensions and establish some "transfer results" under adjoint pairs. Then, relative global dimensions are studied which lead to nice characterizations of some properties of particular cases of self-orthogonal subcategories. At the end of the paper, relative derived functors are studied and generalizations of some known results of balance for relative homology are established.
