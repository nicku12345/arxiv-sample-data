In this paper we investigate a categorical aspect of n-trivial extension of a ring by a family of modules. Namely, we introduce the right (resp., left) n-trivial extension of a category by a family of endofunctors. Among other results, projective, injective and flat objects of this category are characterized. We end the paper with two applications. We characterize when an n-trivial extension ring is k-perfect and we establish a result on the selfinjective dimension of an n-trivial extension ring.
