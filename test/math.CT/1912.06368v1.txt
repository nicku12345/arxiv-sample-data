We establish a large class of homotopy coherent Morita-equivalences of Dold-Kan type relating diagrams with values in any weakly idempotent complete additive \infty-category; the guiding example is an \infty-categorical Dold-Kan correspondence between the \infty-categories of simplicial objects and connective coherent chain complexes.   Our results generalize many known 1-categorical equivalences such as the classical Dold-Kan correspondence, Pirashvili's Dold-Kan type theorem for abelian \Gamma-groups and, more generally, the combinatorial categorical equivalences of Lack and Street.
