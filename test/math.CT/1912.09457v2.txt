We introduce a generalization of the notion of a negligible morphism and study the associated tensor ideals and thick ideals. These ideals are defined by considering deformations of a given monoidal category \mathcal{C} over a local ring R. If the maximal ideal of R is generated by a single element, we show that any thick ideal of \mathcal{C} admits an explicitely given modified trace function. As examples we consider various Deligne categories and the categories of tilting modules for a quantum group at a root of unity and for a semisimple, simply connected algebraic group in prime characteristic. We prove an elementary geometric description of the thick ideals in quantum type A and propose a similar one in the modular case.
