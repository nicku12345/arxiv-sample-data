Given an additive category \mathcal{C} and an integer n\geqslant 2. We form a new additive category \mathcal{C}[\epsilon]^n consisting of objects X in \mathcal{C} equipped with an endomorphism \epsilon_X satisfying {\epsilon^n_X}=0. First, using the descriptions of projective and injective objects in \mathcal{C}[\epsilon]^n, we not only establish a connection between Gorenstein flat modules over a ring R and R[t]/(t^n), but also prove that an Artinian algebra R satisfies some homological conjectures if and only if so does R[t]/(t^n). Then we show that the corresponding homotopy category \K(\mathcal{C}[\epsilon]^n) is a triangulated category when \mathcal{C} is an idempotent complete exact category. Moreover, under some conditions for an abelian category \mathcal{A}, the natural quotient functor Q from \K(\mathcal{A}[\epsilon]^n) to the derived category \D(\mathcal{A}[\epsilon]^n) produces a recollement of triangulated categories. Finally, we prove that if \mathcal{A} is an Ab4-category with a compact projective generator, then \D(\mathcal{A}[\epsilon]^n) is a compactly generated triangulated category.
