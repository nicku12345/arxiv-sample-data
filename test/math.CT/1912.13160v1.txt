Let A be an algebra over a commutative ring k. We introduce the notion of a coquasitriangular left bialgebroid over A and show that the category of left comodules over such a bialgebroid has a lax braiding. We also investigate a Tannaka type construction of bimonads and bialgebroids. As an application, we establish the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan (FRT) construction over A. Our construction associates a coquasitriangular bialgebroid to a braided object (M, c) in the category of A-bimodules such that M is finitely generated and projective as a left A-module. A Hopf algebroid version of this construction is also provided.
