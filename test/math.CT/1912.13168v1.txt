In this work, using the functoriality of Drinfeld center of fusion categories, we generalize an earlier result on the functoriality of full center of simple separable algebras in a fixed fusion category to all fusion categories. This generalization produces a new center functor, which involves both Drinfeld center and full center and will be called the pointed Drinfeld center functor. We prove that this pointed Drinfeld center functor is a symmetric monoidal equivalence. It turns out that this functor provides a precise and rather complete mathematical formulation of the boundary-bulk relation of 1+1D rational conformal field theories (RCFT). In this process, we solve an old problem of computing the fusion of two 0D (or 1D) wall CFT's along a non-trivial 1+1D bulk RCFT.
