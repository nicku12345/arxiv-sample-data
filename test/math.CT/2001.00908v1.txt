We employ projective Fraisse theory to define the "generic combinatorial n-simplex" as the generic pro-finite, simplicial complex that is associated to a family of simply defined selection maps between finite triangulations of the simplex. The generic combinatorial n-simplex is a set-theoretic object that can be used to define the geometric realization of a simplicial complex without any reference to the Euclidean space. We present a theory of coinitial closure for general Fraisse classes. We study the coinitial closure of our class of selection maps. In the process, we develop further Fraisse theory, the theory of stellar moves, as well as the theory of cellular maps. It turns out that the coinitial closure of selection maps contains the class of face-preserving simplicial maps that are cellular on each face of the n-simplex and is contained in the class of simplicial, face-preserving near-homeomorphisms. Under the PL-Poincare conjecture, this characterizes the coinitial closure of selections.
