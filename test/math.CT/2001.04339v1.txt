The Barratt nerve, denoted B, is the endofunctor that takes a simplicial set to the nerve of the poset of its non-degenerate simplices. The ordered simplicial complex BSd\, X, namely the Barratt nerve of the Kan subdivision Sd\, X, is a triangulation of the original simplicial set X in the sense that there is a natural map BSd\, X\to X whose geometric realization is homotopic to some homeomorphism. This is a refinement to the result that any simplicial set can be triangulated.   A simplicial set is said to be regular if each of its non-degenerate simplices is embedded along its n-th face. That BSd\, X\to X is a triangulation of X is a consequence of the fact that the Kan subdivision makes simplicial sets regular and that BX is a triangulation of X whenever X is regular. In this paper, we argue that B, interpreted as a functor from regular to non-singular simplicial sets, is not just any triangulation, but in fact the best. We mean this in the sense that B is the left Kan extension of barycentric subdivision along the Yoneda embedding.
