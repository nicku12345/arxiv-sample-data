In this note, we survey two instances in the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras where the quantity of a type of structures is intimately related to the size of those same structures. More explicitly, we review the fact that (1) a finite-dimensional algebra admits only finitely many indecomposable modules up to isomorphism if and only if every indecomposable module is finite-dimensional; (2) the category of modules over a finite-dimensional algebra admits only finitely many torsion classes if and only if every torsion class is generated by a finite-dimensional module.
