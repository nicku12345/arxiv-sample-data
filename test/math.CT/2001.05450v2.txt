This is the first in a series of papers about foliations in derived geometry. After introducing derived foliations on arbitrary derived stacks, we concentrate on quasi-smooth and rigid derived foliations on smooth complex algebraic varieties and on their associated formal and analytic versions. Their truncations are classical singular foliations. We prove that a quasi-smooth rigid derived foliation on a smooth complex variety X is formally integrable at any point, and, if we suppose that its singular locus has codimension \geq 2, then the truncation of its analytification is a locally integrable singular foliation on the associated complex manifold X^h. We then introduce the derived category of perfect crystals on a quasi-smooth rigid derived foliation on X, and prove a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for them when X is proper. We discuss several examples and applications.
