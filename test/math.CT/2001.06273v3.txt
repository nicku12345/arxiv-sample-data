Auslander and Kleiner proved in 1994 an abstract version of Green correspondence for pairs of adjoint functors between three categories. They produce additive quotients of certain subcategories giving the classical Green correspondence in the special setting of modular representation theory. Carlson, Peng and Wheeler showed in 1998 that Green correspondence in the classical setting of modular representation theory is actually an equivalence between triangulated categories with respect to a non standard triangulated structure. In the present note we first define and study a version of relative projectivity, respectively relative injectivity with respect to pairs of adjoint functors. We then modify Auslander Kleiner's construction such that the correspondence holds in the setting of triangulated categories.
