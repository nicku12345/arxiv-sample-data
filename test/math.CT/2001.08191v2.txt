In his PhD thesis, Goosen combined the string-net and the generators-and-relations formalisms for arbitrary once-extended 3-dimensional TQFTs. In this paper we work this out in detail for the simplest non-trivial example, where the underlying spherical fusion category is the category of \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-graded vector spaces. This allows us to give an elementary string-net description of the linear maps associated to 3-dimensional bordisms. The string-net formalism also simplifies the description of the mapping class group action in the resulting TQFT. We conclude the paper by performing some example calculations from this viewpoint.
