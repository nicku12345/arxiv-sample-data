We introduce quantum Markov categories as a structure that refines and extends a synthetic approach to probability theory and information theory so that it includes quantum probability and quantum information theory. In this broader context, we analyze three successively more general notions of reversibility and statistical inference: ordinary inverses, disintegrations, and Bayesian inverses. We prove that each one is a strictly special instance of the latter for certain subcategories, providing a categorical foundation for Bayesian inversion as a generalization of reversing a process. We unify the categorical and C^*-algebraic notions of almost everywhere (a.e.) equivalence. As a consequence, we prove many results including a universal no-broadcasting theorem for S-positive categories, a generalized Fisher--Neyman factorization theorem for a.e. modular categories, a relationship between error correcting codes and disintegrations, and the relationship between Bayesian inversion and Umegaki's non-commutative sufficiency.
