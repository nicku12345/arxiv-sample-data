We prove that the L^2-Betti numbers of a rigid C^*-tensor category vanish in the presence of an almost-normal subcategory with vanishing L^2-Betti numbers, generalising a result of Bader, Furman and Sauer. We apply this criterion to show that the categories constructed from totally disconnected groups by Arano and Vaes have vanishing L^2-Betti numbers. Given an almost-normal inclusion of discrete groups \Lambda<\Gamma, with \Gamma acting on a type \mathrm{II}_1 factor P by outer automorphisms, we relate the cohomology theory of the quasi-regular inclusion P\rtimes\Lambda\subset P\rtimes\Gamma to that of the Schlichting completion G of \Lambda<\Gamma. If \Lambda<\Gamma is unimodular, this correspondence allows us to prove that the L^2-Betti numbers of P\rtimes\Lambda\subset P\rtimes\Gamma are equal to those of G.
