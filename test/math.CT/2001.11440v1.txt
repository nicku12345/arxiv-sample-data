Path algebras are a convenient way of describing decompositions of tensor powers of an object in a tensor category. If the category is braided, one obtains representations of the braid groups B_n for all n\in \N. We say that such representations are rigid if they are determined by the path algebra and the representations of B_2. We show that besides the known classical cases also the braid representations for the path algebra for the 7-dimensional representation of G_2 satisfies the rigidity condition, provided B_3 generates \End(V^{\otimes 3}). We obtain a complete classification of ribbon tensor categories with the fusion rules of \g(G_2) if this condition is satisfied.
