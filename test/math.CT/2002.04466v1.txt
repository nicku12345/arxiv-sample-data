Generalizing the algebraic formulation of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FFTC), a class of constraints involving a pair of operators was considered in \cite{ZGK2}. For a given constraint, the existences of extensions of differential and Rota-Baxter operators, of liftings of monads and comonads, and of mixed distributive laws are shown to be equivalent. In this paper, we give a classification of the constraints satisfying these equivalent conditions.
