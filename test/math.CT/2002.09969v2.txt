Let \mathbb F be a finite field. Consider a direct sum V of an infinite number of copies of \mathbb F, consider the dual space V^\diamond, i.~e., the direct product of an infinite number of copies of \mathbb F. Consider the direct sum {\mathbb V}=V\oplus V^\diamond. The object of the paper is the group \mathbf{GL} of continuous linear operators in \mathbb V. We reduce the theory of unitary representations of \mathbf{GL} to projective representations of a certain category whose morphisms are linear relations in finite-dimensional linear spaces over \mathbb F. In fact we consider a certain family  Q_\alpha of subgroups in \mathbb V preserving two-element flags, show that there is a natural multiplication on spaces of double cosets with respect to  Q_\alpha, and reduce this multiplication to products of linear relations. We show that this group has type \mathrm{I} and obtain an 'upper estimate' of the set of all irreducible unitary representations of \mathbf{GL}.
