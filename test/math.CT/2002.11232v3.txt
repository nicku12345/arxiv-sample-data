We prove that pushouts A*_CB of residually finite-dimensional (RFD) C^*-algebras over central subalgebras are always residually finite-dimensional provided the fibers A_p and B_p, p\in \mathrm{spec}~C are RFD, recovering and generalizing results by Korchagin and Courtney-Shulman. This then allows us to prove that certain central pushouts of amenable groups have RFD group C^*-algebras. Along the way, we discuss the problem of when, given a central group embedding H\le G, the resulting C^*-algebra morphism is a continuous field: this is always the case for amenable G but not in general.
