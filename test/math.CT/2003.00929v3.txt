We introduce the notion of intrinsic semilattice entropy \widetilde h in the category \mathcal L_{qm} of generalized quasimetric semilattices and contractive homomorphisms. By using appropriate categories \mathfrak X and functors F:\mathfrak X\to\mathcal L_{qm} we find specific known entropies \widetilde h_\mathfrak X on \mathfrak X as intrinsic functorial entropies, that is, as \widetilde h_\mathfrak X=\widetilde h\circ F. These entropies are the intrinsic algebraic entropy, the algebraic and the topological entropies for locally linearly compact vector spaces, the topological entropy for locally compact totally disconnected groups and the algebraic entropy for locally compact compactly covered abelian groups.
