Any simplicial Hopf algebra involves 2n different projections between the Hopf algebras H_n,H_{n-1} for each n \geq 1. The word projection, here meaning a tuple \partial \colon H_{n} \to H_{n-1} and i \colon H_{n-1} \to H_{n} of Hopf algebra morphisms, such that \partial \, i = \mathrm{id}. Given a Hopf algebra projection (\partial \colon I \to H,i) in a braided monoidal category \mathfrak{C}, one can obtain a new Hopf algebra structure living in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H, due to Radford's theorem. The underlying set of this Hopf algebra is obtained by an equalizer which only defines a sub-algebra (not a sub-coalgebra) of I in \mathfrak{C}. In fact, this is a braided Hopf algebra since the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a Hopf algebra with an invertible antipode is braided monoidal. To apply Radford's theorem in a simplicial Hopf algebra successively, we require some extra functorial properties of Yetter-Drinfeld modules. Furthermore, this allows us to model Majid's braided Hopf crossed module notion from the perspective of a simplicial structure.
