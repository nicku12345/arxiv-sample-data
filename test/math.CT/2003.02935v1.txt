We propose a general method to construct new triangulated categories, relative stable categories, as additive quotients of a given one. This construction enhances results of Beligiannis, particularly in the tensor-triangular setting. We prove a birationality result showing that the original category and its relative stable quotient are equivalent on some open piece of their spectrum.
