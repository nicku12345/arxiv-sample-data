We collect some foundational results regarding the homotopy theory of A-infinity-categories. Our two main results are (1) An equivalence between the infinity-category of dg-categories and the infinity-category of A-infinity-categories, and (2) A proof that two models for quotients of A-infinity-categories (as constructed by Lyubashenko-Manzyuk and Lyubashenko-Ovisienko) satisfy the universal property of quotients in the infinity-categorical sense. Our aims are to give succinct accounts of infinity-categorical language for users of A-infinity-categories, and to exhibit concrete models of localizations of A-infinity-categories. Indeed, we apply the results here in [OT19] to prove a Liouville version of a conjecture of Teleman from the 2014 ICM.
