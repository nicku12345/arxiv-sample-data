We axiomatize the extended operators in topological orders (possibly gravitationally anomalous, possibly with degenerate ground states) in terms of monoidal Karoubi-complete n-categories which are mildly dualizable and have trivial centre. Dualizability encodes the word "topological," and we take it as the definition of "(separable) multifusion n-category"; triviality of the centre implements the physical principle of "remote detectability." We show that such n-categorical algebras are Morita-invertible (in the appropriate higher Morita category), thereby identifying topological orders with anomalous fully-extended TQFTs. We identify centreless fusion n-categories (i.e. multifusion n-categories with indecomposable unit) with centreless braided fusion (n{-}1)-categories. We then discuss the classification in low spacetime dimension, proving in particular that all (1{+}1)- and (3{+}1)-dimensional topological orders, with arbitrary symmetry enhancement, are suitably-generalized topological sigma models. These mathematical results confirm and extend a series of conjectures and proposals by X.G. Wen et al.
