In this paper, we study logics of bounded distributive residuated lattices with modal operators considering \Box and \Diamond in a noncommutative setting. We introduce relational semantics for such substructural modal logics. We prove that any canonical logic is Kripke complete via discrete duality and canonical extensions. That is, we show that a modal extension of the distributive full Lambek calculus is the logic of its frames if its variety is closed under canonical extensions. After that, we establish a Priestley-style duality between residuated distributive modal algebras and topological Kripke structures based on Priestley spaces.
