The categorical formulation of the Eilenberg-Watts calculus relates, for any pair of finite categories M and N, the finite categories Fun^{le}(N,M) and Fun^{re}(N,M) of linear left or right exact functors and the Deligne product \bar N \boxtimes M by adjoint equivalences. We establish a variant of this calculus for the case that the finite categories M and N are module categories over a finite tensor category. This provides in particular canonical and explicitly computable equivalences between categories of left or right exact module functors (or, more generally, balanced functors) and certain twisted centers of bimodule categories.
