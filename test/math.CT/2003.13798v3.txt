We study tensor categories which interpolate partition categories, representation categories of so-called easy quantum groups, and which we view as subcategories of Deligne's interpolation categories for the symmetric groups. Focusing on semisimplicity and descriptions of indecomposable objects, we generalise results known for special cases, including Deligne's \mathrm{\underline{Rep}}(S_t). In particular, we identify those values of the interpolation parameter t which correspond to semisimple and nonsemisimple categories, respectively, for all group-theoretical partition categories. A crucial ingredient is an abstract analysis of certain subobject lattices developed by Knop, which we adapt to categories of partitions. We go on to prove a parametrisation of the indecomposable objects in all interpolating partition categories for non-zero interpolation parameter via a system of finite groups which we associate to any partition category, and which we also use to describe the associated graded rings of the Grothendieck rings of those interpolation categories.
