Morphisms in a monoidal category are usually interpreted as processes, and graphically depicted as square boxes. In practice, we are faced with the problem of interpreting what non-square boxes ought to represent in terms of the monoidal category and, more importantly, how should they be composed. Examples of this situation include lenses or learners. We propose a description of these non-square boxes, which we call open diagrams, using the monoidal bicategory of profunctors. A graphical coend calculus can then be used to reason about open diagrams and their compositions.
