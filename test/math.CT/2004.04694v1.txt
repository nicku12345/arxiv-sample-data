This is a companion paper of arXiv:1901.09461, where different notions of dimension for triangulated categories are discussed. Here we compute dimensions for some examples of triangulated categories and thus illustrate and motivate material from loc. cit. Our examples include path algebras of finite ordered quivers, orbifold projective lines, some tensor powers of path algebras in Dynkin quivers of type A and categories, generated by an exceptional pair.
