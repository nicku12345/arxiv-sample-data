A bicommutant category is a higher categorical analog of a von Neumann algebra. We study the bicommutant categories which arise as the commutant \mathcal{C}' of a fully faithful representation \mathcal{C}\to\operatorname{Bim}(R) of a unitary fusion category \mathcal{C}. Using results of Izumi, Popa, and Tomatsu about existence and uniqueness of representations of unitary (multi)fusion categories, we prove that if \mathcal{C} and \mathcal{D} are Morita equivalent unitary fusion categories, then their commutant categories \mathcal{C}' and \mathcal{D}' are equivalent as bicommutant categories. In particular, they are equivalent as tensor categories: \[ \Big(\,\,\mathcal{C}\,\,\simeq_{\text{Morita}}\,\,\mathcal{D}\,\,\Big) \qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad \Big(\,\,\mathcal{C}'\,\,\simeq_{\text{tensor}}\,\,\mathcal{D}'\,\,\Big). \] This categorifies the well-known result according to which the commutants (in some representations) of Morita equivalent finite dimensional \rm C^*-algebras are isomorphic von Neumann algebras, provided the representations are `big enough'.   We also introduce a notion of positivity for bi-involutive tensor categories. For dagger categories, positivity is a property (the property of being a \rm C^*-category). But for bi-involutive tensor categories, positivity is extra structure. We show that unitary fusion categories and \operatorname{Bim}(R) admit distinguished positive structures, and that fully faithful representations \mathcal{C}\to\operatorname{Bim}(R) automatically respect these positive structures.
