We study unitary pseudonatural transformations (UPTs) between fibre functors Rep(G) -> Hilb, where G is a compact quantum group. For fibre functors F_1, F_2 we show that the category of UPTs F_1 -> F_2 and modifications is isomorphic to the category of finite-dimensional *-representations of the corresponding bi-Hopf-Galois object. We give a constructive classification of fibre functors accessible by a UPT from the canonical fibre functor, as well as UPTs themselves, in terms of Frobenius algebras in the category Rep(A_G), where A_G is the Hopf *-algebra dual to the compact quantum group. As an example, we show that finite-dimensional quantum isomorphisms from a quantum graph X are UPTs between fibre functors on Rep(G_X), where G_X is the quantum automorphism group of X.
