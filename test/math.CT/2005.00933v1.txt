The question of what should be meant by a measurement is tackled from a mathematical perspective whose physical interpretation is that a measurement is a process via which a finite amount of classical information is generated. This motivates a mathematical definition of space of measurements that consists of a topological stably Gelfand quantale whose open sets represent measurable physical properties. It also accounts for the distinction between quantum and classical measurements, and for the emergence of "classical observers." The latter have a relation to groupoid C*-algebras, and link naturally to Schwinger's notion of selective measurement.
