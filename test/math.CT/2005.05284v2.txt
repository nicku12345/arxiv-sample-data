We show that the following five categories are equivalent: (1) the opposite category of commutative von Neumann algebras; (2) compact strictly localizable enhanced measurable spaces; (3) measurable locales; (4) hyperstonean locales; (5) hyperstonean spaces. This result can be seen as a measure-theoretic counterpart of the Gelfand duality between commutative unital C*-algebras and compact Hausdorff topological spaces.
