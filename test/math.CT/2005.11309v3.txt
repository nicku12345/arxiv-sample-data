Integral categories form a sub-class of pre-abelian categories whose systematic study was initiated by Rump in 2001. In the first part of this article we determine whether several categories of topological and bornological vector spaces are integral. Moreover, we establish that the class of integral categories is not contained in the class of quasi-abelian categories, and that there exist semi-abelian categories that are neither integral nor quasi-abelian. In the last part of the article we show that a category is quasi-abelian if and only if it has admissible intersections, in the sense considered recently by Br{\"u}stle, Hassoun and Tattar. This exhibits that a rich class of non-abelian categories having this property arises naturally in functional analysis.
