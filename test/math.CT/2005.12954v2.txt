We develop a theory which unifies the universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras as studied by Sweedler, Manin and Tambara with the recently introduced \cite{AGV1} bi/Hopf-algebras that are universal among all support equivalent (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras. Our approach uses vector spaces endowed with a family of linear maps between tensor powers of A, called \Omega-algebras. This allows us to treat algebras, coalgebras, braided vector spaces and many other structures in a unified way. We study V-universal measuring coalgebras and V-universal comeasuring algebras between \Omega-algebras A and B, relative to a fixed subspace V of \Vect(A,B). By considering the case A=B, we derive the notion of a V-universal (co)acting bialgebra (and Hopf algebra) for a given algebra A. In particular, this leads to a refinement of the existence conditions for the Manin-Tambara universal coacting bi/Hopf algebras. We establish an isomorphism between the V-universal acting bi/Hopf algebra and the finite dual of the V-universal coacting bi/Hopf algebra under certain conditions on V in terms of the finite topology on \End_F(A).
