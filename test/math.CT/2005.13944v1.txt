In this paper we show that integral fusion categories with rational structure constants admit a natural group of symmetries given by the Galois group of their character tables. We also generalize a well known result of Burnside from representation theory of finite groups. More precisely, we show that any row corresponding to a non invertible object in the character table of a weakly integral fusion category contains a zero entry.
