For an n-dimensional Leibniz/Lie algebra \mathfrak{h} over a field k we introduce a new invariant {\mathcal A}(\mathfrak{h}), called the \emph{universal algebra} of \mathfrak{h}, as a quotient of the polynomial algebra k[X_{ij} \, | \, i, j = 1, \cdots, n] through an ideal generated by n^3 polynomials. We prove that {\mathcal A}(\mathfrak{h}) admits a unique bialgebra structure which makes it an initial object among all commutative bialgebras coacting on \mathfrak{h}. The new object {\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h}) is the key tool in answering two open problems in Lie algebra theory. First, we prove that the automorphism group {\rm Aut}_{Lbz} (\mathfrak{h}) of \mathfrak{h} is isomorphic to the group U \bigl( G({\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h})^{\rm o} ) \bigl) of all invertible group-like elements of the finite dual {\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h})^{\rm o}. Secondly, for an abelian group G, we show that there exists a bijection between the set of all G-gradings on \mathfrak{h} and the set of all bialgebra homomorphisms {\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h}) \to k[G]. Based on this, all G-gradings on \mathfrak{h} are explicitly classified and parameterized. {\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h}) is also used to prove that there exists a universal commutative Hopf algebra associated to any finite dimensional Leibniz algebra \mathfrak{h}.
