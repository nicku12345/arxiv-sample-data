It is well known that the underlying simplicial set of any simplicial group is a Kan complex. Roughly speaking, Kan complex is an infinite-dimensional analogue of groupoid, and the relation between groupoids and categories resembles that between groups and monoids. Thus one may ask if the underlying simplicial set of each simplicial monoid is a quasi-category. In this short note, we construct a simplicial monoid whose underlying simplicial set is not a quasi-category.
