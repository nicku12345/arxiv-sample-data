We give an explicit point-set construction of the Dennis trace map from the K-theory of endomorphisms K\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{C}) to topological Hochschild homology \mathrm{THH}(\mathcal{C}) for any spectral Waldhausen category \mathcal{C}. We describe the necessary technical foundations, most notably a well-behaved model for the spectral category of diagrams in \mathcal{C} indexed by an ordinary category via the Moore end. This is applied to define a version of Waldhausen's S_{\bullet}-construction for spectral Waldhausen categories, which is central to this account of the Dennis trace map.   Our goals are both convenience and transparency---we provide all details except for a proof of the additivity theorem for \mathrm{THH}, which is taken for granted---and the exposition is concerned not with originality of ideas, but rather aims to provide a useful resource for learning about the Dennis trace and its underlying machinery.
