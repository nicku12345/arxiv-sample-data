Spherical functors provide a formal way to package autoequivalences of enhanced triangulated categories. Moreover, E. Segal proved that any autoequivalence of an enhanced triangulated category can be realized as a spherical twist. When exhibiting an autoequivalence as a spherical twist, one has various choices for the source category of the spherical functor. We prove that, in the DG setting, given two spherical twists there is a natural way to produce a new spherical functor whose twist is the composition of the spherical twists we started with, and whose source category semiorthogonally decomposes into the source categories for the two spherical functors we began with.
