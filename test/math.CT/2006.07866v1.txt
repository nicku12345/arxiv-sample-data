We introduce the higher version of the notion of Adachi-Iyama-Reiten's support \tau-tilting pairs, which is a generalization of maximal \tau_n-rigid pairs in the sense of Jacobsen-J{\o}rgensen. Let \mathcal C be an (n+2)-angulated category with an n-suspension functor \Sigma^n and an Opperman-Thomas cluster tilting object. We show that relative n-rigid objects in \mathcal C are in bijection with \tau_n-rigid pairs in the n-abelian category \mathcal C/{\rm add}\Sigma^n T, and relative maximal n-rigid objects in \mathcal C are in bijection with support \tau_n-tilting pairs. We also show that relative n-self-perpendicular objects are in bijection with maximal \tau_n-rigid pairs. These results generalise the work for \mathcal C being 2n-Calabi-Yau by Jacobsen-J{\o}rgensen and the work for n=1 by Yang-Zhu.
