We build foundations of an approach to study canonical forms of 2-Calabi--Yau triangulated categories with cluster-tilting objects, using dg algebras and relative singularity categories. This is motivated by cluster theory, singularity categories, Wemyss's Homological Minimal Model Program and the relations between these topics.
