The standard categorical notion of a categorical quotient is insufficient, in that it fails to recover the expected quotients in certain categories. We present an alternative formulation of \mathcal{F}-quotients in a category \mathbf{C}, which are relativized to a faithful functor \mathcal{F}: \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}. The isomorphism theorems of universal algebras generalize to this setting, and we additionally find important links between \mathcal{F}-quotients in the concrete category of first-order structures, and quotients defined for model-theoretic equivalence classes.
