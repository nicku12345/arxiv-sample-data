In a 2006 article Schlichting conjectured that the negative {\it K--}theory of any abelian category must vanish. This conjecture was generalized in a 2019 article by Antieau, Gepner and Heller, who hypothesized that the negative {\it K--}theory of any category with a bounded {\it t--}structure must vanish.   Both conjectures will be shown to be false.
