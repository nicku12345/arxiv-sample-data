This paper initiates a discrete Hodge theory for cellular sheaves taking values in a category of lattices and Galois connections. The key development is the Tarski Laplacian, an endomorphism on the cochain complex whose fixed points yield a cohomology that agrees with the global section functor in degree zero. This has immediate applications in consensus and distributed optimization problems over networks and broader potential applications.
