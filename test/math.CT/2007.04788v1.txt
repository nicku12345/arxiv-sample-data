Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu as a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. In this paper, we show that the idempotent completion of an extriangulated category admits a natural extriangulated structure. As applications, we prove that cotorsion pairs in an extriangulated category induce cotorsion pairs in its idempotent completion under certain condition, and the idempotent completion of a recollement of extriangulated categories is still a recollement.
