We construct two non-semisimple braided ribbon tensor categories of modules for each singlet vertex operator algebra \mathcal{M}(p), p\geq 2. The first category consists of all finite-length \mathcal{M}(p)-modules with atypical composition factors, while the second is the subcategory of modules that induce to local modules for the triplet vertex operator algebra \mathcal{W}(p). We show that every irreducible module has a projective cover in the second of these categories, although not in the first, and we compute all fusion products involving atypical irreducible modules and their projective covers.
