We identify and highlight certain landmark results in Samson Abramsky's work which we believe are fundamental to current developments and future trends. In particular, we focus on the use of (i) topological duality methods to solve problems in logic and computer science; (ii) category theory and, more particularly, free (and co-free) constructions; (iii) these tools to unify the `power' and `structure' strands in computer science.
