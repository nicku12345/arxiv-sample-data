We analyze a model for the homotopy theory of complete filtered \mathbb{Z}-graded L_\infty-algebras, which lends itself well to computations in deformation theory and homotopical algebra. We first give an explicit proof of an unpublished result of E. Getzler which states that the category {\widehat{\mathsf{Lie}}\lbrack 1\rbrack_\infty} of such L_\infty-algebras and filtration-preserving \infty-morphisms admits the structure of a category of fibrant objects (CFO) for a homotopy theory. As a novel application, we use this result to show that, under some mild conditions, every L_\infty-quasi-isomorphism between L_\infty-algebras in {\widehat{\mathsf{Lie}}\lbrack 1\rbrack_\infty} has a filtration preserving homotopy inverse. Finally, building on previous joint work with V. Dolgushev, we prove that the simplicial Maurer--Cartan functor, which assigns a Kan simplicial set to each complete filtered L_\infty-algebra, is an exact functor between the respective categories of fibrant objects. We interpret this as an optimal homotopy-theoretic generalization of the classical Goldman--Millson theorem from deformation theory. One immediate application is the ``\infty-categorical'' uniqueness theorem for homotopy transferred structures previously sketched by the author in arXiv:1612.07868.
