We present a categorical point of view on dynamical quantum groups in terms of categories of Harish-Chandra bimodules. We prove Tannaka duality theorems for forgetful functors into the monoidal category of Harish-Chandra bimodules in terms of a slight modification of the notion of a bialgebroid. Moreover, we show that the standard dynamical quantum groups F(G) and F_q(G) are related to parabolic restriction functors for classical and quantum Harish-Chandra bimodules. Finally, we exhibit a natural Weyl symmetry of the parabolic restriction functor using Zhelobenko operators and show that it gives rise to the action of the dynamical Weyl group.
