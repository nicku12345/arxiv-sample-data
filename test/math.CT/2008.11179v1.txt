Let V_*\otimes V\rightarrow\mathbb{C} be a non-degenerate pairing of countable-dimensional complex vector spaces V and V_*. The Mackey Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}^M(V,V_*) corresponding to this paring consists of all endomorphisms \varphi of V for which the space V_* is stable under the dual endomorphism \varphi^*: V^*\rightarrow V^*. We study the tensor Grothendieck category \mathbb{T} generated by the \mathfrak{g}-modules V, V_* and their algebraic duals V^* and V^*_*. This is an analogue of categories considered in prior literature, the main difference being that the trivial module \mathbb{C} is no longer injective in \mathbb{T}. We describe the injective hull I of \mathbb{C} in \mathbb{T}, and show that the category \mathbb{T} is Koszul. In addition, we prove that I is endowed with a natural structure of commutative algebra. We then define another category _I\mathbb{T} of objects in \mathbb{T} which are free as I-modules. Our main result is that the category {}_I\mathbb{T} is also Koszul, and moreover that {}_I\mathbb{T} is universal among abelian \mathbb{C}-linear tensor categories generated by two objects X, Y with fixed subobjects X'\hookrightarrow X, Y'\hookrightarrow Y and a pairing X\otimes Y\rightarrow \text{\textbf{1}} where \textbf{1} is the monoidal unit. We conclude the paper by discussing the orthogonal and symplectic analogues of the categories \mathbb{T} and {}_I\mathbb{T}.
