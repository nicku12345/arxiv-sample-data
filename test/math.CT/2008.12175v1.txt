Let B^\times be the biset functor over \mathbb{F}_2 sending a finite group~G to the group B^\times(G) of units of its Burnside ring B(G), and let \widehat{B^\times} be its dual functor. The main theorem of this paper gives a characterization of the cokernel of the natural injection from B^\times in the dual Burnside functor \widehat{\mathbb{F}_2B}, or equivalently, an explicit set of generators \mathcal{G}_S of the kernel L of the natural surjection \mathbb{F}_2B\to \widehat{B^\times}. This yields a two terms projective resolution of \widehat{B^\times}, leading to some information on the extension functors \mathrm{Ext}^1(-,B^\times). For a finite group G, this also allows for a description of B^\times(G) as a limit of groups B^\times(T/S) over sections (T,S) of G such that T/S is cyclic of odd prime order, Klein four, dihedral of order 8, or a Roquette 2-group. Another consequence is that the biset functor B^\times is not finitely generated, and that its dual \widehat{B^\times} is finitely generated, but not finitely presented. The last result of the paper shows in addition that \mathcal{G}_S is a minimal set of generators of L, and it follows that the lattice of subfunctors of L is uncountable.
