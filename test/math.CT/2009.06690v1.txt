We associate a diagrammatic monoidal category \mathcal{H}\textit{eis}_k(A;z,t), which we call the quantum Frobenius Heisenberg category, to a symmetric Frobenius superalgebra A, a central charge k \in \mathbb{Z}, and invertible parameters z,t in some ground ring. When A is trivial, i.e. it equals the ground ring, these categories recover the quantum Heisenberg categories introduced in our previous work, and when the central charge k is zero they yield generalizations of the affine HOMFLY-PT skein category. By exploiting some natural categorical actions of \mathcal{H}\textit{eis}_k(A;z,t) on generalized cyclotomic quotients, we prove a basis theorem for morphism spaces.
