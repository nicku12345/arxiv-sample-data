We define Grothendieck-Witt spectra in the setting of Poincar\'e \infty-categories, show that they fit into an extension with a K- and an L-theoretic part and deduce localisation sequences for Verdier quotients. As special cases we obtain generalisations of Karoubi's fundamental and periodicity theorems for rings in which 2 need not be invertible.   A novel feature of our approach is the systematic use of ideas from cobordism theory by interpreting the hermitian Q-construction as an algebraic cobordism category. We also use this to give a new description of the LA-spectra of Weiss and Williams.
