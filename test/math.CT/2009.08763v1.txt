Over a commutative noetherian ring R, the prime spectrum controls, via the assignment of support, the structure of both \mathsf{Mod}(R) and \mathsf{D}(R). We show that, just like in \mathsf{Mod}(R), the assignment of support classifies hereditary torsion pairs in the heart of any nondegenerate compactly generated t-structure of \mathsf{D}(R). Moreover, we investigate whether these t-structures induce derived equivalences, obtaining a new source of Grothendieck categories which are derived equivalent to \mathsf{Mod}(R).
