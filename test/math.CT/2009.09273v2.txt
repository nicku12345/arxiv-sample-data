In this article, we construct a 2-shaded rigid {\rm C}^* multitensor category with canonical unitary dual functor directly from a standard \lambda-lattice. We use the notions of traceless Markov towers and lattices to define the notion of module and bimodule over standard \lambda-lattice(s), and we explicitly construct the associated module category and bimodule category over the corresponding 2-shaded rigid {\rm C}^* multitensor category.   As an example, we compute the modules and bimodules for Temperley-Lieb-Jones standard \lambda-lattices in terms of traceless Markov towers and lattices. Translating into the unitary 2-category of bigraded Hilbert spaces, we recover DeCommer-Yamshita's classification of \mathcal{TLJ} modules in terms of edge weighted graphs, and a classification of \mathcal{TLJ} bimodules in terms of biunitary connections on square-partite weighted graphs.   As an application, we show that every (infinite depth) subfactor planar algebra embeds into the bipartite graph planar algebra of its principal graph.
