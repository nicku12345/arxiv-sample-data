Let \mathcal{X} be a semibrick in an extriangulated category \mathscr{C}. Let \mathcal{T} be the filtration subcategory generated by \mathcal{X}. We give a one-to-one correspondence between simple semibricks and length wide subcategories in \mathscr{C}. This generalizes a bijection given by Ringel in module categories, which has been generalized by Enomoto to exact categories. Moreover, we also give a one-to-one correspondence between cotorsion pairs in \mathcal{T} and certain subsets of \mathcal{X}. Applying to the simple minded systems of an triangulated category, we recover a result given by Dugas.
