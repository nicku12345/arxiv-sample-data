In this paper we define and study a notion of comprehension schemes for cartesian fibrations over (\infty,1)-categories, generalizing Johnstone's respective notion for ordinary fibered categories. This includes natural generalizations of smallness, local smallness and the notion of definability in the sense of B\'{e}nabou, as well as of Jacob's comprehension categories. Thereby, among others, we will characterize numerous categorical properties of \infty-toposes, the notion of univalence and the externalization of internal (\infty,1)-categories via comprehension schemes. An example of particular interest will be the universal cartesian fibration given by externalization of the ''freely walking chain'' in the (\infty,1)-category of small (\infty,1)-categories. In the end, we take a look at the externalization construction of internal (\infty,1)-categories from a model categorical perspective and review various examples from the literature in this light.
