We characterize cyclic algebras over the associative and the framed little disks operad in any symmetric monoidal bicategory. The cyclicity is appropriately treated in a homotopy coherent way. When the symmetric monoidal bicategory is specified to consist of linear categories subject to finiteness conditions, we prove that cyclic associative and cyclic framed little disks algebras, respectively, are equivalent to pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories and balanced braided Grothendieck-Verdier categories, a type of category that was introduced by Boyarchenko-Drinfeld based on Barr's notion of a *-autonomous category. We use these results and Costello's derived modular envelope construction to obtain two applications to quantum topology: I) We extract a consistent system of handlebody group representations from any balanced braided Grothendieck-Verdier category inside a certain symmetric monoidal bicategory of linear categories and show that this generalizes the handlebody part of Lyubashenko's mapping class group representations. II) We establish a Grothendieck-Verdier duality for the category extracted from a modular functor by evaluation on the circle (without any assumption on semisimplicity), thereby generalizing a result of Bakalov-Kirillov.
