We define the affinization of an arbitrary monoidal category \mathcal{C}, corresponding to the category of \mathcal{C}-diagrams on the cylinder. We also give an alternative characterization in terms of adjoining dot generators to \mathcal{C}. The affinization formalizes and unifies many constructions appearing in the literature. In particular, we describe a large number of examples coming from Hecke-type algebras, braids, tangles, and knot invariants. When \mathcal{C} is rigid, its affinization is isomorphic to its horizontal trace, although the two definitions look quite different. In general, the affinization and the horizontal trace are not isomorphic.
