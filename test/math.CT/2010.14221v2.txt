We study the symplectic geometry of derived intersections of Lagrangian morphisms. In particular, we show that for a functional f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{A}_k^1, the derived critical locus has a natural Lagrangian fibration \textbf{Crit}(f) \rightarrow X. In the case where f is non-degenerate and the strict critical locus is smooth, we show that the Lagrangian fibration on the derived critical locus is determined by the Hessian quadratic form.
