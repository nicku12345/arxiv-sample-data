The celebrated Diamond Lemma of Bergman gives an effectively verifiable criterion of uniqueness of normal forms for term rewriting in associative algebras. We present a new way to interpret and prove this result from the viewpoint of homotopical algebra. Our main result states that every multiplicative free resolution of an algebra with monomial relations gives rise to its own Diamond Lemma, so that Bergman's condition of "resolvable ambiguities" becomes the first non-trivial component of the Maurer--Cartan equation in the corresponding tangent complex. The same approach works for many other algebraic structures, emphasizing the relevance of computing multiplicative free resolutions of algebras with monomial relations.
