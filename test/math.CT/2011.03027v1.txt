We prove a universal property for the (\infty, n)-category of correspondences, generalizing and providing a new proof for the case n = 2 from [GR17]. We also provide conditions under which a functor out of a higher category of correspondences of \mathcal{C} can be extended to a higher category of correspondences of the free cocompletion of \mathcal{C}. These results will be used in the sequels to this paper to construct (\infty, n)-categorical versions of the theories of quasicoherent and ind-coherent sheaves in derived algebraic geometry.
