We use the theta correspondence to study the equivalence between Godement-Jacquet and Jacquet-Langlands L-functions for \mathrm{GL}(2). We show that the resulting comparison is in fact an exotic symmetric monoidal structure on the category of \mathrm{GL}(2)-modules.   Moreover, this enables us to construct an Abelian category of abstractly automorphic representations, whose irreducible objects are the usual automorphic representations. We speculate that this category is a natural setting for the study of automorphic phenomena for \mathrm{GL}(2), and demonstrate its basic properties.   This paper is a part of the author's thesis.
