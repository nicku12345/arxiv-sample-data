We propose a compactification of the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions of a triangulated category. Under mild conditions on the triangulated category, we conjecture that this compactification is a real manifold with boundary, on which the action of the auto-equivalence group extends continuously. The key ingredient in the compactification is an embedding of the stability space into an infinite-dimensional projective space. We study this embedding in detail in the case of 2-Calabi--Yau categories associated to quivers, and prove our conjectures in the A_2 and \widehat{A_1} cases. Central to our analysis is a detailed understanding of Harder--Narasimhan multiplicities and how they transform under auto-equivalences. We achieve this by introducing a structure called a Harder--Narasimhan automaton and constructing examples for A_2 and \widehat{A_1}.
