Given a suitable stable monoidal model category \mathscr{C} and a specialization closed subset V of its Balmer spectrum one can produce a Tate square for decomposing objects into the part supported over V and the part supported over V^c spliced with the Tate object. Using this one can show that \mathscr{C} is Quillen equivalent to a model built from the data of local torsion objects, and the splicing data lies in a rather rich category. As an application, we promote the torsion model for the homotopy category of rational circle-equivariant spectra from [18] to a Quillen equivalence. In addition, a close analysis of the one step case highlights important features needed for general torsion models which we will return to in future work.
