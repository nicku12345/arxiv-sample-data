There is exactly one bosonic (3+1)-dimensional topological order whose only nontrivial particle is an emergent boson: pure \mathbb{Z}_2 gauge theory. There are exactly two (3+1)-dimensional topological orders whose only nontrivial particle is an emergent fermion: pure "spin-\mathbb{Z}_2" gauge theory, in which the dynamical field is a spin structure; and an anomalous version thereof. I give three proofs of this classification, varying from hands-on to abstract. Along the way, I provide a detailed study of the braided fusion 2-category \mathcal{Z}_{(1)}(\Sigma \mathbf{SVec}) of string and particle operators in pure spin-\mathbb{Z}_2 gauge theory.
