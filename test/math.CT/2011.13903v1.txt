Many examples of zeta functions in number theory and combinatorics are special cases of a construction in homotopy theory known as a decomposition space. This article aims to introduce number theorists to the relevant concepts in homotopy theory and lays some foundations for future applications of decomposition spaces in the theory of zeta functions.
