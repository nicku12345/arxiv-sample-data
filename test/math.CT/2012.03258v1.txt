We give a simultaneous generalization of recollements of abelian categories and triangulated categories, which we call recollements of extriangulated categories. For a recollement (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{C}) of extriangulated categories, we show that cotorsion pairs in \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{C} induce cotorsion pairs in \mathcal{B} under certain conditions. As an application, our main result recovers a result given by Chen for recollements of triangulated categories, and it also shows a new phenomena when it is applied to abelian categories.
