Motivated by the theory of correspondence functors, we introduce the notion of {\em germ} in a finite poset, and the notion of {\em germ extension} of a poset. We show that any finite poset admits a largest germ extension called its {\em germ closure}. We say that a subset U of a finite lattice T is {\em germ extensible} in T if the germ closure of U naturally embeds in T. We show that any for any subset S of a finite lattice T, there is a unique germ extensible subset U of T such that U\subseteq S\subseteq \overline{G}(U), where \overline{G}(U)\subseteq T is the embedding of the germ closure of U.
