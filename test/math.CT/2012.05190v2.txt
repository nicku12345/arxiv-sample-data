We give necessary and sufficient conditions for stratification and costratification to descend along a coproduct preserving, tensor-exact functor between tensor-triangulated categories which are rigidly-compactly generated by their tensor units. We then apply these results to non-positive commutative DG-rings and connective ring spectra. In particular, this gives a support-theoretic classification of (co)localizing subcategories, and thick subcategories of compact objects of the derived category of a non-positive commutative DG-ring with finite amplitude. Our results also establish the telescope conjecture in this setting. For a non-positive commutative DG-ring A, we also investigate whether certain finiteness conditions in \mathsf{D}(A) (for example, proxy-smallness) can be reduced to questions in the better understood category \mathsf{D}(H^0A). For a connective commutative ring spectrum R we give a necessary and sufficient condition for \mathsf{D}(R) to be stratified and costratified by \pi_0R.
