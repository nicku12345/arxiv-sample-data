We give algebraic characterizations of the type I and CCR properties for locally compact second countable, ample Hausdorff groupoids in terms of subquotients of their Boolean inverse semigroups of compact open bisections. It yields in turn algebraic characterizations of both properties for inverse semigroups in terms of subquotients of their booleanizations.
