Constructible sheaves of abelian groups on a stratified space can be equivalently described in terms of representations of the exit-path category. In this work, we provide a similar presentation of the abelian category of perverse sheaves on a stratified surface in terms of representations of the so-called paracyclic category of the surface. The category models a hybrid exit-entrance behaviour with respect to chosen sectors of direction, placing it "in between" exit and entrance path categories. In particular, this perspective yields an intrinsic definition of perverse sheaves as an abelian category without reference to derived categories and t-structures.
