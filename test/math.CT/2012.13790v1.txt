We study the biclosedness of the monoidal categories of modules and comodules over a (left or right) Hopf algebroid, along with the bimodule category centres of the respective opposite categories and a corresponding categorical equivalence to anti Yetter-Drinfel'd contramodules and anti Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, respectively. This is directly connected to the existence of a trace functor on the monoidal categories of modules and comodules in question, which in turn allows to recover (or define) cyclic operators enabling cyclic cohomology.
