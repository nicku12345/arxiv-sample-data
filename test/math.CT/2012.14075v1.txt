Let {\mathcal X} be a category fibered in groupoids over a finite field \mathbb{F}_q, and let k be an algebraically closed field containing \mathbb{F}_q. Denote by \phi_k\colon {\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal X}_k the arithmetic Frobenius of {\mathcal X}_k/k and suppose that {\mathcal M} is a stack over \mathbb{F}_q (not necessarily in groupoids). Then there is a natural functor \alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}\colon{\mathcal M}({\mathcal X})\to{\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X})), where {\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X})) is the category of \phi_k-invariant maps {\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal M}. A version of Drinfeld's lemma states that if {\mathcal X} is a projective scheme and {\mathcal M} is the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves of finite presentation, then \alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}} is an equivalence.   We extend this result in several directions. For proper algebraic stacks or affine gerbes {\mathcal X}, we prove Drinfeld's lemma and deduce that \alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}} is an equivalence for very general algebraic stacks {\mathcal M}.   For arbitrary {\mathcal X}, we show that \alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}} is an equivalence when {\mathcal M} is the stack of immersions, the stack of quasi-compact separated \'etale morphisms or any quasi-separated Deligne-Mumford stack with separated diagonal.
