Let \mathfrak{g} be a semisimple simply-laced Lie algebra of finite type. Let \mathcal{C} be an abelian categorical representation of the quantum group U_q(\mathfrak{g}) categorifying an integrable representation V. The Artin braid group B of \mathfrak{g} acts on D^b(\mathcal{C}) by Rickard complexes, providing a triangulated equivalence \Theta_{w_0}:D^b(\mathcal{C}_\mu) \to D^b(\mathcal{C}_{w_0(\mu)}), where \mu is a weight of V and \Theta_{w_0} is a positive lift of the longest element of the Weyl group.   We prove that this equivalence is t-exact up to shift when V is isotypic, generalising a fundamental result of Chuang and Rouquier in the case \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2. For general V, we prove that \Theta_{w_0} is a perverse equivalence with respect to a Jordan-H\"older filtration of \mathcal{C}.   Using these results we construct, from the action of B on V, an action of the cactus group on the crystal of V. This recovers the cactus group action on V defined via generalised Sch\"utzenberger involutions, and provides a new connection between categorical representation theory and crystal bases. We also use these results to give new proofs of theorems of Berenstein-Zelevinsky, Rhoades, and Stembridge regarding the action of symmetric group on the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of its Specht modules.
