We show that compactly generated t-structures in the derived category of a commutative ring R are in a bijection with certain families of compactly generated t-structures over the local rings R_\mathfrak{m} where \mathfrak{m} runs through the maximal ideals in the Zariski spectrum \mathrm{Spec}(R). The families are precisely those satisfying a gluing condition for the associated sequence of Thomason subsets of \mathrm{Spec}(R). As one application, we show that the compact generation of a homotopically smashing t-structure can be checked locally over localizations at maximal ideals. In combination with a result due to Balmer and Favi, we conclude that the \otimes-Telescope Conjecture for a quasi-coherent and quasi-separated scheme is a stalk-local property. Furthermore, we generalize the results of Trlifaj and \c{S}ahinkaya and establish an explicit bijection between cosilting objects of cofinite type over R and compatible families of cosilting objects of cofinite type over all localizations R_\mathfrak{m} at maximal primes.
