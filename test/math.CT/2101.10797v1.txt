For a locally presentable abelian category \mathsf B with a projective generator, we construct the projective derived and contraderived model structures on the category of complexes, proving in particular the existence of enough homotopy projective complexes of projective objects. We also show that the derived category \mathsf D(\mathsf B) is generated, as a triangulated category with coproducts, by the projective generator of \mathsf B. For a Grothendieck abelian category \mathsf A, we construct the injective derived and coderived model structures on complexes. Assuming Vopenka's principle, we prove that the derived category \mathsf D(\mathsf A) is generated, as a triangulated category with products, by the injective cogenerator of \mathsf A. More generally, we define the notion of an exact category with an object size function and prove that the derived category of any such exact category with exact \kappa-directed colimits of chains of admissible monomorphisms has Hom sets. In particular, the derived category of any locally presentable abelian category has Hom sets.
