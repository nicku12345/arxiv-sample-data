We define a quantum poset to be a hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebra equipped with a quantum partial order in Weaver's sense. These quantum posets form a category that is complete, cocomplete and symmetric monoidal closed. This yields a quantum analogue of the inclusion order on a powerset. We show that every quantum poset can be embedded into its powerset via a quantum analogue of the mapping that takes each element of a poset to its down set.
