In quantum computation, the computation is achieved by linear operators in Hilbert spaces. In this work, we explain an idea of a new computation scheme, in which the linear operators are replaced by (higher) functors between two (higher) categories. The fundamental problem in realizing this idea is the physical realization of (higher) functors. We provide a theoretical idea of realizing (higher) functors based on the physics of topological orders.
