This paper introduces the notion of n-morphisms between two A_\infty-algebras, such that 0-morphisms correspond to standard A_\infty-morphisms and 1-morphisms correspond to A_\infty-homotopies between A_\infty-morphisms. The set of higher morphisms between two A_\infty-algebras then defines a simplicial set which has the property of being an algebraic \infty-category. The operadic structure of n-A_\infty-morphisms is also encoded by new families of polytopes, which we call the n-multiplihedra and which generalize the standard multiplihedra. These are constructed from the standard simplices and multiplihedra by lifting the Alexander-Whitney map to the level of simplices. Rich combinatorics arise in this context, as conveniently described in terms of overlapping partitions. Shifting from the A_\infty to the \Omega B As framework, we define the analogous notion of n-morphisms between \Omega B As-algebras, which are again encoded by the n-multiplihedra, endowed with a thinner cell decomposition by stable gauged ribbon tree type. We then realize this higher algebra of A_\infty and \Omega B As-algebras in Morse theory. Given two Morse functions f and g, we construct n-\Omega B As-morphisms between their respective Morse cochain complexes endowed with their \Omega B As-algebra structures, by counting perturbed Morse gradient trees associated to an admissible simplex of perturbation data. We moreover show that any inner horn of higher morphisms arising from a count of perturbed Morse gradient trees can always be filled, not only algebraically but also geometrically.
