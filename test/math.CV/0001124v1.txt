Let p(z) be a monic polynomial of degree n, with complex coefficients, and let q(z) be its monic factor. We prove an asymptotically sharp inequality of the form \|q\|_{E} \le C^n \|p\|_E, where \|\cdot\|_E denotes the sup norm on a compact set E in the plane. The best constant C_E in this inequality is found by potential theoretic methods. We also consider applications of the general result to the cases of a disk and a segment.
