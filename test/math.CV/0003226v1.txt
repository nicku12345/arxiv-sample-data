Chern number formulas for holomorphic jet bundles are computed for projective curves and for projective surfaces. These formulas are used to show that certain minimal surfaces of general type (generic hypersurfaces of degree at least 5 in projective 3-spaces in particular) are hyperbolic in the sense of complex hyperbolic geometry.
