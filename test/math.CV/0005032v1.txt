We construct polynomial approximations of Dzjadyk type (in terms of the k-th modulus of continuity, k \ge 1) for analytic functions defined on a continuum E in the complex plane, which simultaneously interpolate at given points of E. Furthermore, the error in this approximation is decaying as e^{-cn^\alpha} strictly inside E, where c and \alpha are positive constants independent of the degree n of the approximating polynomial.
