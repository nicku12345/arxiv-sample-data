An n-dimensional complex manifold M is said to be (holomorphically) dominable by \CC^n if there is a map F:\CC^n \ra M which is holomorphic such that the Jacobian determinant \det(DF) is not identically zero. Such a map F is called a dominating map. In this paper, we attempt to classify algebraic surfaces X which are dominable by \CC^2 using a combination of techniques from algebraic topology, complex geometry and analysis. One of the key tools in the study of algebraic surfaces is the notion of Kodaira dimension (defined in section 2). By Kodaira's pioneering work and its extensions, an algebraic surface which is dominable by \CC^2 must have Kodaira dimension less than two. Using the Kodaira dimension and the fundamental group of X, we succeed in classifying algebraic surfaces which are dominable by \CC^2 except for certain cases in which X is an algebraic surface of Kodaira dimension zero and the case when X is rational without any logarithmic 1-form. More specifically, in the case when X is compact (namely projective), we need to exclude only the case when X is birationally equivalent to a K3 surface (a simply connected compact complex surface which admits a globally non-vanishing holomorphic 2-form) that is neither elliptic nor Kummer (see sections 3 and 4 for the definition of these types of surfaces).
