We prove and discuss three results on zero distribution of gaussian analytic functions: (i) the Edeleman-Kostlan formula for the expectation of the counting measure; (ii) a variation on the theme of Calabi's rigidity theorem; (iii) Offord's estimate of exponential decay of the tail probabilities of an anlytic function having an access or deficiency of zeros in a given region.
