We classify all compact simply connected homogeneous CR manifolds M of codimension one and with non-degenerate Levi form up to CR equivalence. The classification is based on our previous results and on a description of the maximal connected compact group G(M) of automorphisms of M. We characterize also the standard homogeneous CR manifolds as the homogeneous CR manifolds whose group G(M) in not semisimple.
