Consider the moduli functor of canonically polarized complex manifolds with Hilbert polynomial h, and let M_h be the corresponding coarse quasi-projective moduli scheme. We show that M_h is Brody hyperbolic in the following sense: Assume that for some quasi-projective variety U there exists a morphism U --> M_h, quasi-finite over its image, which is induced by a family f: V --> U, belonging to the moduli problem. Then all holomorphic maps from the complex plane to U are constant.
