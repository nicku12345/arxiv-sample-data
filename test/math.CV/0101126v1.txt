In this note we show that there are algebraic families of hyperbolic, Fermat-Waring type hypersurfaces in P^n of degree 4(n-1)^2, for all dimensions n>1. Moreover, there are hyperbolic Fermat-Waring hypersurfaces in P^n of degree 4n^2-2n+1 possessing complete hyperbolic, hyperbolically embedded complements.
