We extend to any simply connected K\"ahler manifold with non-positive sectional curvature some conditions for interpolation in \mathbb{C} and in the unit disk given by Berndtsson, Ortega-Cerd\`a and Seip. The main tool is a comparison theorem for the Hessian in K\"ahler geometry due to Greene, Wu and Siu, Yau.
