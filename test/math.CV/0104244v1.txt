Hexagonal circle patterns are introduced, and a subclass thereof is studied in detail. It is characterized by the following property: For every circle the multi-ratio of its six intersection points with neighboring circles is equal to -1. The relation of such patterns with an integrable system on the regular triangular lattice is established. A kind of a B"acklund transformation for circle patterns is studied. Further, a class of isomonodromic solutions of the aforementioned integrable system is introduced, including circle patterns analogons to the analytic functions z^\alpha and \log z.
