Normal forms of almost complex structures in a neighborhood of pseudoholomorphic curve are considered. We define normal bundles of such curves and study the properties of linear bundle almost complex structures. We describe 1-jet of the almost complex structure along a curve in terms of its Nijenhuis tensor. For pseudoholomorphic tori we investigate the problem of pseudoholomorphic foliation of the neighborhood. We obtain some results on nonexistence of the tori deformation.
