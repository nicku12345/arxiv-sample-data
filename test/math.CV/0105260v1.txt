Given a holomorphic selfmap f of the complex projective plane of algebraic degree at least 2, we give sufficient conditions on a positive closed (1,1) current S of unit mass under which the normalized pullbacks of S under iterates of f converge to the Green current T.   In particular, we completely characterize the plane algebraic curves whose normalized pullbacks converge weakly to T.
