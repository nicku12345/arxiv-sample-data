Let \Omega be a bounded, convex domain in a separable Hilbert space. The authors prove a version of the theorem of Bun Wong, which asserts that if such a domain admits an automorphism orbit accumulating at a strongly pseudoconvex boundary point then it is biholomorphic to the ball. Key ingredients in the proof are a new localization argument using holomorphic peaking functions and the use of new ``normal families'' arguments in the construction of the limit biholomorphism.
