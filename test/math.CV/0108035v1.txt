We first show that the canonical solution operator to d-bar restricted to (0,1)-forms with holomorphic coefficients can be expressed by an integral operator using the Bergman kernel. This result is used to prove that in the case of the unit disc in C the canonical solution operator to d-bar restricted to (0,1)-forms with holomorphic coefficients is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. In the sequel we give a direct proof of the last statement using orthonormal bases and show that in the case of polydisc and the unit ball in C^n, n>1, the corresponding operator fails to be a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.
