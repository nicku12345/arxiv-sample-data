In this paper we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the canonical solution operator to \overline \partial  restricted to radial symmetric Bergman spaces to be a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. We also discuss compactness of the solution operator in spaces of entire functions in one variable. In the sequel we consider several examples and also treat the case of weighted spaces of entire functions in several variables.
