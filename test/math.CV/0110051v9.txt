A new class of compact K\"ahler manifolds, called special, is defined, which are the ones having no surjective meromorphic map to an orbifold of general type. The special manifolds are in many respect higher-dimensional generalisations of rational and elliptic curves. For example, we show that being rationally connected or having vanishing Kodaira dimension implies being special. Moreover, for any compact K\"ahler X we define a fibration c_X:X\to C(X), which we call its core, such that the general fibres of c_X are special, and every special subvariety of X containing a general point of X is contained in the corresponding fibre of c_X. We then conjecture and prove in low dimensions and some cases that: 1) Special manifolds have an almost abelian fundamental group. 2) Special manifolds are exactly the ones having a vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric. 3) The core is a fibration of general type, which means that so is its base C(X),when equipped with its orbifold structure coming from the multiple fibres of c_X. 4) The Kobayashi pseudometric of X is obtained as the pull-back of the orbifold Kobayashi pseudo-metric on C(X), which is a metric outside some proper algebraic subset. 5) If X is projective,defined over some finitely generated (over \Bbb Q) subfield K of the complex number field, the set of K-rational points of X is mapped by the core into a proper algebraic subset of C(X). These two last conjectures are the natural generalisations to arbitrary X of Lang's conjectures formulated when X is of general type.
