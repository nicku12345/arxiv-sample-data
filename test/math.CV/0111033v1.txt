In this paper we define a distinguished boundary for the complex crowns \Xi\subeq G_\C /K_\C of non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces G/K. The basic result is that affine symmetric spaces of G can appear as a component of this boundary if and only if they are non-compactly causal symmetric spaces.
