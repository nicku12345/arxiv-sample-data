Let G/H be a semisimple symmetric space. Then the space L^2(G/H) can be decomposed into a finite sum of series representations induced from parabolic subgroups of G. The most continuous part of the spectrum of L^2(G/H) is the part induced from the smallest possible parabolic subgroup. In this paper we introduce Hardy spaces canonically related to this part of the spectrum for a class of non-compactly causal symmetric spaces. The Hardy space is a reproducing Hilbert space of holomorphic functions living on a tube type bounded symmetric domain, containing G/H as a boundary component. A boundary value map is constructed and we show that it induces an G-isomorphism onto a multiplicity free subspace of full spectrum in the most continuous part L_{\rm mc}^2(G/H) of L^2(G/H). We also relate our Hardy space with the classical Hardy space on the tube domain.
