We present a restricted version of some affine Jacobi's residue formula (on an affine algebraic variety) with applications to higher dimensional (and affine) analogues of Wood's (or Reiss's) relations about the interpolation of pieces of analytic manifolds. We also compare algebraic and analytic constructions of residue currents along analytic cycles and sketch some of their main properties. This work extend previous work of the authors in the affine space.
