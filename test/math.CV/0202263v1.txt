In this thesis we solve the coboundary equation \delta c=d with bounds for cochains with values in a coherent subsheaf of some \mathcal{O}^p_{\Omega}, where \Omega is a Stein manifold. In particular the existence of a finite set of global generators is not assumed. Our result applies therefore to the ideal sheaf \mathcal{J}_V\subset \mathcal{O}_{\C^N} of germs of holomorphic functions vanishing on a closed analytic submanifold V\subset\C^N. Although we are mainly interested in the estimates for the solutions of \delta c=d, the techniques used also lead to a proof for the classical Theorem B of Cartan for coherent subsheafs of some \mathcal{O}^p_{\Omega}, avoiding the Mittag-Leffler argument. We derive an extension theorem for holomorphic functions on V to entire functions, with control on growth behaviour. \newline As a corollary we construct a linear tame extension operator H(V)\to H(\C^N) under the hypothesis that H(V) is linear tamely isomorphic to the infinite type power series space \Lambda_\infty(k^{\frac{1}{n}}), n= dim_{\C}V; this condition is also necessary. Here the supnorms on H(V) are taken over intersections of V with polycylinders of polyradii e^m, m\in \N. Aytuna asked how much, and what kind of, information about the complex analytic structure of V is carried by the Fr\'echet space H(V). We prove that H(V) is linear tamely isomorphic to a power series space of infinite type if and only if V is algebraic.
