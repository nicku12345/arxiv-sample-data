Complex geometric properties of the orbits of a non-compact real form G_0 in a flag manifold Z=G/Q of a complex semi-simple groups G=G_0^\mathbb C are studied. Schubert varieties are used to construct a complex submanifold with optimal slice properties in any given G_0-orbit. For an open G_0- orbit D, given p in the boundary of D, a variety Y\setminus D containing p with maximal dimension with respect to the compact cycles in D is constructed. The method of incidence varieties then yields information on the complex geometry of the associated cycle space. In particular, holomorphic convexity is verified and in the Hermitian case a fine classification is obtained.
