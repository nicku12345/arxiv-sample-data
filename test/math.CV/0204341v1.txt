A real form G of a complex semisimple Lie group G^C has only finitely many orbits in any given G^C-flag manifold Z=G^C/Q. The complex geometry of these orbits is of interest, e.g., for the associated representation theory. The open orbits D generally possess only the constant holomorphic functions, and the relevant associated geometric objects are certain positive-dimensional compact complex submanifolds of D which, with very few well-understood exceptions, are parameterized by the Wolf cycle domains \Omega_W(D) in G^C/K^C, where K is a maximal compact subgroup of G. Thus, for the various domains D in the various ambient spaces Z, it is possible to compare the cycle spaces \Omega_W(D).   The main result here is that, with the few exceptions mentioned above, for a fixed real form G all of the cycle spaces \Omega_W(D) are the same. They are equal to a universal domain \Omega_{AG} which is natural from the the point of view of group actions and which, in essence, can be explicitly computed.   The essential technical result is that if \hat \Omega  is a G-invariant Stein domain which contains \Omega_{AG} and which is Kobayashi hyperbolic, then \hat \Omega =\Omega_{AG}. The equality of the cycle domains follows from the fact that every \Omega_W(D) is itself Stein, is hyperbolic, and contains \Omega_{AG}.
