Let M\subset C^N be a minimal real-analytic CR-submanifold and M'\subset C^{N'} a real-algebraic subset through points p\in M and p'\in M'. We show that that any formal (holomorphic) mapping f\colon (C^N,p)\to (C^{N'},p'), sending M into M', can be approximated up to any given order at p by a convergent map sending M into M'. If M is furthermore generic, we also show that any such map f, that is not convergent, must send (in an appropriate sense) M into the set E'\subset M' of points of D'Angelo infinite type. Therefore, if M' does not contain any nontrivial complex-analytic subvariety through p', any formal map f as above is necessarily convergent.
