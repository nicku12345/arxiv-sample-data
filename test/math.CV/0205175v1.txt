We consider Laguerre polynomials L_n^{(\alpha_n)}(nz) with varying negative parameters \alpha_n, such that the limit A = -\lim_n \alpha_n/n exists and belongs to (0,1). For A > 1, it is known that the zeros accumulate along an open contour in the complex plane. For every A \in (0,1), we describe a one-parameter family of possible limit sets of the zeros. Under the condition that the limit r= - \lim_n \frac{1}{n} \log \dist(\alpha_n, \mathbb Z) exists, we show that the zeros accumulate on \Gamma_r \cup [\beta_1,\beta_2] with \beta_1 and \beta_2 only depending on A. For r \in [0,\infty), \Gamma_r is a closed loop encircling the origin, which for r = +\infty, reduces to the origin. This shows a great sensitivity of the zeros to \alpha_n's proximity to the integers.   We use a Riemann-Hilbert formulation for the Laguerre polynomials, together with the steepest descent method of Deift and Zhou to obtain asymptotics for the polynomials, from which the zero behavior follows.
