We consider local CR-immersions of a strictly pseudoconvex real hypersurface M\subset\bC^{n+1}, near a point p\in M, into the unit sphere \mathbb S\subset\bC^{n+d+1} with d>0. Our main result is that if there is such an immersion f\colon (M,p)\to \mathbb S and d < n/2, then f is {\em rigid} in the sense that any other immersion of (M,p) into \mathbb S is of the form \phi\circ f, where \phi is a biholomorphic automorphism of the unit ball \mathbb B\subset\bC^{n+d+1}. As an application of this result, we show that an isolated singularity of an irreducible analytic variety of codimension d in \bC^{n+d+1} is uniquely determined up to affine linear transformations by the local CR geometry at a point of its Milnor link.
