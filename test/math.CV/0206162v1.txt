We consider ensembles of random polynomials of the form p(z)=\sum_{j = 1}^N a_j P_j where \{a_j\} are independent complex normal random variables and where \{P_j\} are the orthonormal polynomials on the boundary of a bounded simply connected analytic plane domain \Omega \subset C relative to an analytic weight \rho(z) |dz|. In the simplest case where \Omega is the unit disk and \rho=1, so that P_j(z) = z^j, it is known that the average distribution of zeros is the uniform measure on S^1. We show that for any analytic (\Omega, \rho), the zeros of random polynomials almost surely become equidistributed relative to the equilibrium measure on \partial\Omega as N\to\infty. We further show that on the length scale of 1/N, the correlations have a universal scaling limit independent of (\Omega, \rho).
