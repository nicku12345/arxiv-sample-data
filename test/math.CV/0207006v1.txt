We study the Siegel--Schr\"oder center problem on the linearization of analytic germs of diffeomorphisms in several complex variables, in the Gevrey--s, s>0 category. We introduce a new arithmetical condition of Bruno type on the linear part of the given germ, which ensures the existence of a Gevrey--s formal linearization. We use this fact to prove the effective stability, i.e. stability for finite but long time, of neighborhoods of the origin for the analytic germ.
