We prove a product decomposition of the Zariski closure of the jet lifts of a holomorphic map f from C into a semi-abelian variety A, provided that f is of finite order. On the other hand, by giving an example of such a map f into a three dimensional abelian variety we show that this product decomposition does not hold in general; there was a gap in the proofs of some articles which claimed that such a product decomposition is always true.
