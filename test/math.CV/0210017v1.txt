The loop space LP_1 of the Riemann sphere consisting of all C^k or Sobolev W^{k,p} maps from the circle S^1 to P_1 is an infinite dimensional complex manifold. The loop group LPGL(2,C) acts on LP_1. We prove that the group of LPGL(2,C) invariant holomorphic line bundles on LP_1 is isomorphic to an infinite dimensional Lie group. Further, we prove that the space of holomorphic sections of these bundles is finite dimensional, and compute the dimension for a generic bundle.
