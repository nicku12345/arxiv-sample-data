We classify compact surfaces with torsion-free affine connections for which every geodesic is a simple closed curve. In the process, we obtain completely new proofs of all the major results concerning the Riemannian case.   In contrast to previous work, our approach is twistor-theoretic, and depends fundamentally on the fact that, up to biholomorphism, there is only one complex structure on CP2.
