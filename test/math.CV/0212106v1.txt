David maps are generalizations of classical planar quasiconformal maps for which the dilatation is allowed to tend to infinity in a controlled fashion. In this note we examine how these maps distort Hausdorff dimension. We show \vs {enumerate} [\bullet] Given \alpha and \beta in [0,2], there exists a David map \phi:\CC \to \CC and a compact set \Lambda such that \Hdim \Lambda =\alpha and \Hdim \phi(\Lambda)=\beta. \vs [\bullet] There exists a David map \phi:\CC \to \CC such that the Jordan curve \Gamma=\phi (\Sen) satisfies \Hdim \Gamma=2.\vs {enumerate} One should contrast the first statement with the fact that quasiconformal maps preserve sets of Hausdorff dimension 0 and 2. The second statement provides an example of a Jordan curve with Hausdorff dimension 2 which is (quasi)conformally removable.
