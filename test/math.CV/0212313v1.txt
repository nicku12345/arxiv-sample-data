This is an expanded version of lectures given in Hangzhou and Beijing, on the symplectic forms common to Seiberg-Witten theory and the theory of solitons. Methods for evaluating the prepotential are discussed. The construction of new integrable models arising from supersymmetric gauge theories are reviewed, including twisted Calogero-Moser systems and spin chain models with twisted monodromy conditions. A practical framework is presented for evaluating the universal symplectic form in terms of Lax pairs. A subtle distinction between a Lie algebra and a Lie group version of this symplectic form is clarified, which is necessary in chain models.
