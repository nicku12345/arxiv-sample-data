It is shown that the cycle space of an arbitrary orbit of a non-Hermitian real form G in a flag manifold Z=G^\mathbb C/Q of its complexification is naturally equivalent to a certain universal domain which depends only on G. This makes use of complex geometric methods which were recently developed for the purpose of handling the case of open orbits together with a better understanding of the connection to Schubert varieties and the related complex slices along lower-dimensional Gorbits.
