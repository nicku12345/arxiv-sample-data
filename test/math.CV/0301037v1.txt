In this paper we study the orthogonality conditions satisfied by Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)} when the parameters \alpha and \beta are not necessarily >-1. We establish orthogonality on a generic closed contour on a Riemann surface. Depending on the parameters, this leads to either full orthogonality conditions on a single contour in the plane, or to multiple orthogonality conditions on a number of contours in the plane. In all cases we show that the orthogonality conditions characterize the Jacobi polynomial P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)} of degree n up to a constant factor.
