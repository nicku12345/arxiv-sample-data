We give a generalization, in the context of sheaves, of a classical result of Grothendieck concerning the integrability of connections of type (0,1) over a {\cal C}^{\infty} vector bundle over a complex manifold. We introduce the notion of \bar{\partial}-coherent sheaf, which is a {\cal C}^{\infty} notion, and we prove the existence of an (exact) equivalence between the category of coherent analytic sheaves and the category of \bar{\partial}-coherent sheaves. The principal difficulty of the proof is the solution of a quasi-linear differential equation with standard \bar{\partial} as its principal term. We are able to find a solution of this differential equation, using a rapidly convergent iteration scheme of Nash-Moser type.
