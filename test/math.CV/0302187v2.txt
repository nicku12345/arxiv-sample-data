Let G/K be an irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type with the standard homogeneous complex structure. Then the real symplectic manifold (T^*(G/K),\Omega) has the natural complex structure J^-. We construct all G-invariant K\"ahler structures (J,\Omega) on homogeneous domains in T^*(G/K) anticommuting with J^-. Each such a hypercomplex structure, together with a suitable metric, defines a hyperk\"ahler structure. As an application, we obtain a new proof of the Harish-Chandra and Moore theorem.
