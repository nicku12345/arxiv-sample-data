We try to find a geometric interpretation of the wedge product of positive closed laminar currents in \mathbb{C}^2. We say such a wedge product is geometric if it is given by intersecting the disks filling up the currents.   Uniformly laminar currents do always intersect geometrically in this sense. We also introduce a class of ``strongly approximable'' laminar currents, natural from the dynamical point of view, and prove that such currents intersect geometrically provided they have continuous potentials.
