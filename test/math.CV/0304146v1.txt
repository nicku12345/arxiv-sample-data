The regular type of a real hyper-surface M in an (almost) complex manifold at some point p is the maximal contact order at p of M with germs of non singular (pseudo) holomorphic disks. The main purpose of this paper is to give two intrinsic characterizations the type: one in terms of Lie brackets of a complex tangent vector field on M, the other in terms of some kind of derivatives of the Levi form.
