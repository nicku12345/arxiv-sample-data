In this paper we define and study pseudoholomorphic vector bundles structures, particular cases of which are tangent and normal bundle almost complex structures. These are intrinsically related to the Gromov D-operator. As an application we deduce normal forms of 1-jets of almost complex structures along a submanifold. In dimension four we relate these normal forms to the problem of pseudoholomorphic foliation of a neighborhood of a curve and the question of non-deformation and persistence of pseudoholomorphic curves.
