We simplify proof of the theorem that close to any pseudoholomorphic disk there passes a pseudoholomorphic disk of arbitrary close size with any pre-described sufficiently close direction. We apply these results to the Kobayashi and Hanh pseudodistances. It is shown they coincide in dimensions higher than four. The result is new even in the complex case.
