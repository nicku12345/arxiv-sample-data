We consider a linear analytic ordinary differential equation with complex time having a nonresonant irregular singular point. We study it as a limit of a generic family of equations with confluenting Fuchsian singularities.   In 1984 V.I.Arnold asked the following question: is it true that some operators from the monodromy group of the perturbed (Fuchsian) equation tend to Stokes operators of the nonperturbed irregular equation? Another version of this question was also independently proposed by J.-P.Ramis in 1988.   We consider the case of Poincar\'e rank 1 only. We show (in dimension two) that generically no monodromy operator tends to a Stokes operator; on the other hand, in any dimension commutators of appropriate noninteger powers of the monodromy operators around singular points tend to Stokes operators.
