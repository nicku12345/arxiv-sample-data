In a wide class of weighted Bergman spaces, we construct invertible non-cyclic elements. These are then used to produce z-invariant subspaces of index higher than one. In addition, these elements generate nontrivial bilaterally invariant subspaces in anti-symmetrically weighted Hilbert spaces of sequences.
