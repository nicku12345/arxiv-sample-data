In this short note we improve a dimension formula of Takeuchi for the dimension of the hyperfunction solutions of some holonomic D-modules. Besides the constructibility result and local index formula of Kashiwara for the holomorphic solution complex, we only use a vanishing theorem of Lebeau together with a simple calculation in terms of constructible functions.
