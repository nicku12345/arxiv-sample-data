Let \Omega be a pseudoconvex domain with C^2-smooth boundary in \mathbb CP^n. We prove that the \bar\partial-Neumann operator N exists for (p,q)-forms on \Omega. Furthermore, there exists a t_0>0 such that the operators N, \bar\partial^*N, \bar\partial N and the Bergman projection are regular in the Sobolev space W^t (\bar{\Omega})  for t<t_0.   The boundary estimates above have applications in complex geometry. We use the estimates to prove the nonexistence of C^{2, \alpha} real Levi-flat hypersurfaces in \mathbb CP^n. We also show that there exist no non-zero L^2-holomorphic (p, 0)-forms on any pseudoconcave domain in \mathbb CP^n with p > 0.
