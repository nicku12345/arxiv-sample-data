A locally conformally Kaehler (l.c.K.) manifold is a complex manifold admitting a Kaehler covering \tilde M, with each deck transformation acting by Kaehler homotheties. A compact l.c.K. manifold is Vaisman if it admits a holomorphic flow acting by non-trivial homotheties on \tilde M. We prove a structure theorem for compact Vaisman manifolds. Every compact Vaisman manifold M is fibered over a circle, the fibers are Sasakian, the fibration is locally trivial, and M is reconstructed as a Riemannian suspension from the Sasakian structure on the fibers and the monodromy automorphism induced by this fibration. This construction is canonical and functorial in both directions.
