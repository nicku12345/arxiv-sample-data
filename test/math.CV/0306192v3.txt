In this paper, we study the moduli spaces \mathcal{M}_{\delta,c_2} of stable rank-2 vector bundles on non-K\" ahler elliptic surfaces, thus giving a classification these bundles; in the case of Hopf and Kodaira surfaces, these moduli spaces admit the structure of an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system.
