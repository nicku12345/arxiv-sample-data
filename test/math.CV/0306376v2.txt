A sequence of points z_k in the unit disk is said to be thin for a given decrease function \rho, if there is a nontrivial bounded holomorphic function such that the infinite series \sum_k \rho(1-|z_k|)|f(z_k)| converges. All sequences will be assumed hyperbolically separated. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem of thinness of a sequence to be non-trivial (one way or the other), and for two different decrease functions to give rise to the same thin sequences. Along the way, some concrete conditions (necessary or sufficient) for a sequence to be thin are obtained.
