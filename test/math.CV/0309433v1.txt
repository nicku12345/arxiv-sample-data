We present drawings on the complex plane of the lines Im(zeta(s))=0 and Re(zeta(s))=0. This allow to illustrate many properties of the zeta function of Riemann. This is an expository paper. It does not pretend to prove any new result about the zeta function. But it gives a new perspective to many known results. Also it may prove useful to show to students of Complex Variables or Analytic Number Theory. (This was my initial motivation to make the drawings).
