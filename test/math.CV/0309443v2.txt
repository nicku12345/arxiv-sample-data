Strong asymptotics on the whole complex plane of a sequence of monic Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(\alpha_n, \beta_n)} is studied, assuming that  \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\alpha_n}{n}=A, \qquad \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\beta _n}{n}=B,  with A and B satisfying  A > -1,  B>-1, A+B < -1. The asymptotic analysis is based on the non-Hermitian orthogonality of these polynomials, and uses the Deift/Zhou steepest descent analysis for matrix Riemann-Hilbert problems. As a corollary, asymptotic zero behavior is derived. We show that in a generic case the zeros distribute on the set of critical trajectories \Gamma of a certain quadratic differential according to the equilibrium measure on \Gamma in an external field. However, when either \alpha_n, \beta_n or \alpha_n+\beta_n are geometrically close to \Z, part of the zeros accumulate along a different trajectory of the same quadratic differential.
