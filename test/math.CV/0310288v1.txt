Using divisors, an analog of the Jacobian for a compact connected nonorientable Klein surface Y is constructed. The Jacobian is identified with the dual of the space of all harmonic real one-forms on Y quotiented by the torsion-free part of the first integral homology of Y. Denote by X the double cover of Y given by orientation. The Jacobian of Y is identified with the space of all degree zero holomorphic line bundles L over X with the property that L is isomorphic to \sigma^*\bar{L}, where \sigma is the involution of X.
