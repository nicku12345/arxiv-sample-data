Let f be a continuous function on the unit circle \Gamma, whose Fourier series is \omega-absolutely convergent for some weight \omega on the set of integers \mathcal{Z}. If f is nowhere vanishing on \Gamma, then there exists a weight \nu on \mathcal{Z} such that 1/f had \nu-absolutely convergent Fourier series. This includes Wiener's classical theorem. As a corollary, it follows that if \phi is holomorphic on a neighbourhood of the range of f, then there exists a weight \chi on \mathcal{Z} such that \hbox{\phi\circ f} has \chi-absolutely convergent Fourier series. This is a weighted analogue of L\'{e}vy's generalization of Wiener's theorem. In the theorems, \nu and \chi are non-constant if and only if \omega is non-constant. In general, the results fail if \nu or \chi is required to be the same weight \omega.
