This paper introduces the annulus SLE_\kappa processes in doubly connected domains. Annulus SLE_6 has the same law as stopped radial SLE_6, up to a time-change. For \kappa\not=6, some weak equivalence relation exists between annulus SLE_\kappa and radial SLE_\kappa. Annulus SLE_2 is the scaling limit of the corresponding loop-erased conditional random walk, which implies that a certain form of SLE_2 satisfies the reversibility property. We also consider the disc SLE_\kappa process defined as a limiting case of the annulus SLE's. Disc SLE_6 has the same law as stopped full plane SLE_6, up to a time-change. Disc SLE_2 is the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk, and is the reversal of radial SLE_2.
