A subbundle of a Hermitian vector bundle (E, h) can be metrically and differentiably defined by the orthogonal projection onto this subbundle. A weakly holomorphic subbundle of a Hermitian holomorphic bundle is, by definition, an orthogonal projection \pi lying in the Sobolev space L^2_1 of L^2 sections with L^2 first order derivatives in the sense of distributions, which satisfies furthermore (\mathrm{Id}-\pi)\circ D''\pi=0. We give a new simple proof of the fact that a weakly holomorphic subbundle of (E, h) defines a coherent subsheaf of {\cal O}(E), that is a holomorphic subbundle of E in the complement of an analytic set of codimension \geq 2. This result was the crucial technical argument in Uhlenbeck's and Yau's proof of the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence on compact K\"ahler manifolds. We give here a much simpler proof based on current theory. The idea is to construct local meromorphic sections of \mathrm{Im} \pi which locally span the fibers. We first make this construction on every one-dimensional submanifold of X and subsequently extend it via a Hartogs-type theorem of Shiffman's.
