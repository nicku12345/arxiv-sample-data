Let M^n be a complete noncompact K\ddot{a}hler manifold of complex dimension n with nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature. Denote by \mathcal{O}_d(M^n) the space of holomorphic functions of polynomial growth of degree at most d on M^n. In this paper we prove that dim_{\mathbb{C}}{\mathcal{O}}_d(M^n)\leq dim_{\mathbb{C}}{\mathcal{O}}_{[d]}(\mathbb{C}^n), for all d>0, with equality for some positive integer d if and only if M^n is holomorphically isometric to \mathbb{C}^n. We also obtain sharp improved dimension estimates when its volume growth is not maximal or its Ricci curvature is positive somewhere.
