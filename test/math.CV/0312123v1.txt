The general theme of this note is illustrated by the following theorem:   Theorem 1. Suppose K is a compact set in the complex plane and 0 belongs to the boundary \partial K. Let {\cal A}(K) denote the space of all functions f on K such that f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of K and f(0)=0. Also for any given positive integer m, let {\cal A}(m,K) denote the space of all f such that f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of K and f(0)=f^{\prime}(0)=...=f^{(m)}(0)=0. Then {\cal A}(m,K) is dense in {\cal A}(K) under the supremum norm on K provided that there exists a sector W=\{r\hbox{\rm e}^{i\theta}; 0\leq r\leq\delta,\alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta\} such that W\cap K=\{0\}.   (This is the well-known Poincare's external cone condition). We present various generalizations of this result in the context of higher dimensions replacing holomorphic with harmonic.
