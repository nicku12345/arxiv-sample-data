Let S be an arbitrary real surface, with or without boundary, contained in a hypersurface M of the complex euclidean space \C^2, with S and M of class C^{2, a}, where 0 < a < 1. If M is globally minimal, if S is totally real except at finitely many complex tangencies which are hyperbolic in the sense of E. Bishop and if the union of separatrices is a tree of curves without cycles, we show that every compact K of S is CR-, W- and L^p-removable (Theorem~1.3). We treat this seemingly global problem by means of purely local techniques, namely by means of families of small analytic discs partially attached to maximally real submanifolds of C^n and by means of a thorough study of the relative disposition of the characteristic foliation with respect to the track on M of a certain half-wedge attached to M. This localization procedure enables us to answer an open problem raised by B. J\"oricke: under a certain nontransversality condition with respect to the characteristic foliation, we show that every closed subset C of a C^{2,a}-smooth maximally real submanifold M^1 of a (n-1)-codimensional generic C^{2,a}-smooth submanifold of \C^n is CR-, W- and L^p-removable (Theorem~1.2'). The known removability results in CR dimension at least two appear to be logical consequences of Theorem~1.2'. The main proof (65p.) is written directly in arbitrary codimension. Finally, we produce an example of a nonremovable 2-torus contained in a maximally real 3-dimensional maximally real submanifold, showing that the nontransversality condition is optimal for universal removability. Numerous figures are included to help readers who are not insiders of higher codimensional geometry.
