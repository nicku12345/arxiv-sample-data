A new generalized function space in which all Gelfand-Shilov classes S^{\prime 0}_\alpha (\alpha>1) of analytic functionals are embedded is introduced. This space of {\it ultrafunctionals} does not possess a natural nontrivial topology and cannot be obtained via duality from any test function space. A canonical isomorphism between the spaces of hyperfunctions and ultrafunctionals on R^k is constructed that extends the Fourier transformation of Roumieu-type ultradistributions and is naturally interpreted as the Fourier transformation of hyperfunctions. The notion of carrier cone that replaces the notion of support of a generalized function for ultrafunctionals is proposed. A Paley-Wiener-Schwartz-type theorem describing the Laplace transformation of ultrafunctionals carried by proper convex closed cones is obtained and the connection between the Laplace and Fourier transformation is established.
