The valence of a function f at a point w is the number of distinct, finite solutions to f(z) = w. Let f be a complex-valued harmonic function in an open set R \subseteq \mathbb{C}. Let S denote the critical set of f and C(f) the global cluster set of f. We show that f(S) \cup C(f) partitions the complex plane into regions of constant valence. We give some conditions such that f(S) \cup C(f) has empty interior. We also show that a component R_0 \subseteq R \backslash f^{-1}(f(S) \cup C(f)) is a n_0-fold covering of some component \Omega_0 \subseteq \mathbb{C} \backslash (f(S) \cup C(f)). If \Omega_0 is simply connected, then f is univalent on R_0. We explore conditions for combining adjacent components to form a larger region of univalence. Those results which hold for C^1 functions on open sets in \mathbb{R}^2 are first stated in that form and then applied to the case of planar harmonic functions. If f is a light, harmonic function in the complex plane, we apply a structure theorem of Lyzzaik to gain information about the difference in valence between components of \mathbb{C} \backslash (f(S) \cup C(f)) sharing a common boundary arc in f(S) \backslash C(f).
