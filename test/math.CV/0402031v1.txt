Bleher and Kuijlaars recently showed that the eigenvalue correlations from matrix ensembles with external source can be expressed by means of a kernel built out of special multiple orthogonal polynomials. We derive a Christoffel-Darboux formula for this kernel for general multiple orthogonal polynomials. In addition, we show that the formula can be written in terms of the solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for multiple orthogonal polynomials, which will be useful for asymptotic analysis.
