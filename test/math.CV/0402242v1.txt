This text is an introduction to math.AG/0110051 (to appear in Ann. Inst. Fourier), and describes a canonical decomposition of compact K\"ahler manifolds X first by means of their "core", the unique fibration on X with fibres special, and orbifold base of general type. Being special means that there does not exist a fibration onto an orbifold of general type. The core is next decomposed into a tower of fibrations with all orbifold fibres either with \kappa=0, or rationally generated (a weak version of rationally connected).
