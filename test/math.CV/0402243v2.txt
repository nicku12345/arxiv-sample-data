An orbifold version of Bogomolov decomposition theorem is established for compact K\"ahler spaces with quotient singularities and first Chern class zero.The proof is a direct adaptation of the classical smooth case, using Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics, and Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem. It implies that normal K3 surfaces are uniformised in the orbifold sense either by normal K3 surfaces or by a complex torus, as conjectured by D.Q. Zhang. It also implies some conjectures on "special" threefolds raised in math.AG/0110051
