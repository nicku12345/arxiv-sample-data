We give a complete list of formal invariants for a large class of formal differential 1-forms \w \in \Bbb C [[ x, y]]dx + \Bbb C [[ x, y]]dy. \indent A \hat{SL}-equisingular deformation is an equireducible deformation which leaves invariant both the local formal types and the holonomy representation of the components of the exceptional divisor. We characterize the 1-forms with finite formal type (t.f.f), i.e. those which admit a semi-universal \hat{SL}-equisingular deformation, and we give an explicit combinatorial criterion of finiteness. \indent The set of 1-forms with finite formal type contains a dense open set (in the sense of Krull's topology)in the set of 1-forms of the second kind.
