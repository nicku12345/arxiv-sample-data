After gluing foliated complex manifolds, we derive a preparation-like theorem for singularities of codimension one foliations and planar vector fields (in the real or complex setting). Without computation, we retrieve and improve results of Levinson-Moser for functions, Dufour-Zhitomirskii for non degenerate codimension 1 foliations (proving in turn the analyticity), Strozyna-Zoladek for non degenerate planar vector fields and Brjuno-Ecalle for saddle-node foliations in the plane.
