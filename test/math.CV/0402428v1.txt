We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the smooth extension of a diffeomorphism between smooth strictly pseudoconvex domains in four real dimensional almost complex manifolds. The proof is mainly based on a reflection principle for pseudoholomorphic discs, on precise estimates of the Kobayashi-Royden infinitesimal pseudometric and on the scaling method in almost complex manifolds.
