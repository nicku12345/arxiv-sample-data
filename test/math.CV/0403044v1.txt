We obtain an embedding theorem for compact strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds which are bounadries of some complete Hermitian manifolds. We use this to compactify some negatively curved Kaehler manifolds with compact strongly pseudoconvex boundary. An embedding theorem for Sasakian manifolds is also derived.
