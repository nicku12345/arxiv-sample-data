We prove that given a \mathcal{C^\infty} Riemannian manifold with boundary, any fat triangulation of the boundary can be extended to the whole manifold. We also show that this result holds extends to \mathcal{C}^1 manifolds, and that in dimensions 2,3 and 4 it also holds for PL manifolds. We employ the main result to prove that given any orientable \mathcal{C^\infty} Riemannian manifold with boundary admits quasimeromorphic mappings onto \hat{\mathbb{R}^n}. In addition some generalizations are given.
