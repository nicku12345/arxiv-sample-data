Let Rat_d denote the space of holomorphic self-maps of {\bf P}^1 of degree d\geq 2, and \mu_f the measure of maximal entropy for f\in Rat_d. The map of measures f\mapsto\mu_f is known to be continuous on Rat_d, and it is shown here to extend continuously to the boundary of Rat_d in \bar{Rat}_d \simeq {\bf P}^{2d+1}, except along a locus I(d) of codimension d+1. The set I(d) is also the indeterminacy locus of the iterate map f\mapsto f^n for every n\geq 2. The limiting measures are given explicitly, away from I(d). The degenerations of rational maps are also described in terms of metrics of non-negative curvature on the Riemann sphere: the limits are polyhedral.
