We consider in the complex field the differential equation \displaystyle \frac{d^2}{d x^2} \Phi(x) = \frac{P_m(x,\a)}{x^2}\Phi(x), where P_m is a monic polynomial function of order m with coefficients \a=(a_1, ..., a_m). We investigate the asymptotic, resurgent, properties of the solutions at infinity, focusing in particular on the analytic dependence on \a of the Stokes-Sibuya multipliers. Taking into account the non trivial monodromy at the origin, we derive a set of functional equations for the Stokes-Sibuya multipliers. We show how these functional relations can be used to compute the Stokes multipliers for a class of polynomials P_m. In particular, we obtain conditions for isomonodromic deformations when m=3.
