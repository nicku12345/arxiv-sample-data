We study the structure of a class of laminar closed positive currents on \mathbb{CP}^2, naturally appearing in birational dynamics. We prove such a current admits natural non intersecting {\em leaves}, that are closed under analytic continuation. As a consequence it can be seen as a {\em foliation cycle} a weak lamination.
