Let M\stackrel\pi \arrow X be a principal elliptic fibration over a Kaehler base X. We assume that the Kaehler form on X is lifted to an exact form on M (such fibrations are called positive). Examples of these are regular Vaisman manifolds (in particular, the regular Hopf manifolds) and Calabi-Eckmann manifolds. Assume that \dim M > 2. Using the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence, we prove that all stable bundles on M are flat on the fibers of the elliptic fibration. This is used to show that all stable vector bundles on M take form L\otimes \pi^* B_0, where B_0 is a stable bundle on X, and L a holomorphic line bundle. For X algebraic this implies that all holomorphic bundles on M are filtrable (that is, obtained by successive extensions of rank-1 sheaves). We also show that all positive-dimensional compact subvarieties of M are pullbacks of complex subvarieties on X.
