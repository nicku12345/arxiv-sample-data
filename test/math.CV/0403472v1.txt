Let p be a trigonometric polynomial, nonnegative on the unit circle \mathbb{T}. We say that a measure \sigma on \mathbb{T} belongs to the polynomial Szego class, if d\sigma=sigma'_{ac}d\theta+d\sigma_s, \sigma_s is singular, and p\ln \sigma'_{ac} is summable on \mathbb{T}. For the associated orthogonal polynomials, we obtain pointwise asymptotics inside the unit disc. Then, we show that this asymptotics holds in the L^2 sense on the unit circle. As a corollary, we get existense of certain modified wave operators.
