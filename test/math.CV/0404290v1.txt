We propose a method to construct examples of strange imbeddings of Hartogs figures into complex manifolds. It gives an imbedding of a "thin" Hartogs figure which does not have any neighborhood biholomorphic to an open set in a Stein manifold, thus unswering a question of E. Poletsky. Then we give an example of a foliated manifold which does not admit any nontrivial imbeddings of a "thick" (i.e. usual) Hartogs figure, giving thus a counterexample to some "selfevident" statements used in foliation theory.
