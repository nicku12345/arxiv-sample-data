A Hilbert space approach to the classical Fantappie transform, based on the concept of Gel'fand triples of locally convex spaces, leads to a novel proof of Martineau-Aizenberg duality theorem. A study of Fantappie transforms of positive measures on the unit ball in \C^n relates ideas of realization theory of multivariate linear systems, locally convex duality and pluripotential theory. This is applied to obtain von Neumann type estimates on the joint numerical range of tuples of Hilbert space operators.
