This paper describes new results on the growth and zeros of the Ruelle zeta function for the Julia set of a hyperbolic rational map. It is shown that the zeta function is bounded by \exp(C_K |s|^{\delta}) in strips |\Re s| \leq K, where \delta is the dimension of the Julia set. This leads to bounds on the number of zeros in strips (interpreted as the Pollicott-Ruelle resonances of this dynamical system). An upper bound on the number of zeros in polynomial regions \{|\Re s | \leq |\Im s|^\alpha\} is given, followed by weaker lower bound estimates in strips \{\Re s > -C, |\Im s|\leq r\}, and logarithmic neighbourhoods \{|\Re s | \leq \rho \log |\Im s| \}. Recent numerical work of Strain-Zworski suggests the upper bounds in strips are optimal.
