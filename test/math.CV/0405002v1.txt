We prove that a Kleinian group G acting upon \mathbb{H}^{n} admits a non-constant G-automorphic function, even if it has torsion elements, provided that the orders of the elliptic (torsion) elements are uniformly bounded. This is accomplished by developing a technique for mashing distinct fat triangulations while preserving fatness.
