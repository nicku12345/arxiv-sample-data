We show here how residue calculus (residue currents, Grothendieck residues, duality theorem) can be used to obtain an algebraic characterization of the Abel-transform of a meromorphic form on germs of analytic sets. We prove by this way a stronger version of Abel-inverse theorem with an "algebraic" approach and we show the link with Wood's theorem. Furthermore, we obtain a new method to bound easily the dimension of the vector space of abelian forms on an algebraic projective hypersurface.
