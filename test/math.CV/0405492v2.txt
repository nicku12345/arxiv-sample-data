We establish the second main theorem with the best truncation level one for an entire holomorphic curve f:\C \to A into a semi-abelian variety A and an arbitrary effective reduced divisor D on A; the low truncation level is important for applications. We will actually prove this for the jet lifts of f. Finally we give some applications, including the solution of a problem posed by Mark Green.
