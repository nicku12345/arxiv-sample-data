We estimate the upper box and Hausdorff dimensions of the Julia set of an expanding semigroup generated by finitely many rational functions, using the thermodynamic formalism in ergodic theory. Furthermore, we show Bowen's formula, and the existence and uniqueness of a conformal measure, for a finitely generated expanding semigroup satisfying the open set condition. What we discuss is the `backward iterated function systems', and since the generator maps are not injective in general, we need some efforts to estimate the measure of disks.
