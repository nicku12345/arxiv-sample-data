The article is devoted to Beta and Gamma functions of Cayley-Dickson numbers. It is shown that there are specific features in comparison with the complex case. These functions serve as examples of meromorphic functions of Cayley-Dickson variables and illustrate applications of line integrals. Useful identities for Beta and Gamma functions are proved.
