This paper is an enhanced version of a more than decade-older paper with a similar title. Many formulae involving both finite and infinite sums of digamma and polygamma functions up to quadratic order, few of which appear in standard reference works or the literature, but which periodically arise in applications, are collected, reviewed, listed and developed to the point that a knowledgeable reader could devise a formal proof. Several errors in the literature are corrected
