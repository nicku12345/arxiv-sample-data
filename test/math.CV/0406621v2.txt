Let f be a birational map of {\bf C}^d, and consider the degree complexity, or asymptotic degree growth rate \delta(f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}({\rm deg}(f^n))^{1/n}. We introduce a family of elementary maps, which have the form f=L\circ J, where L is (invertible) linear, and J(x_1,...,x_d)=(x_1^{-1},...,x_d^{-1}). We develop a method of regularization and show how it can be used to compute \delta for an elementary map.
