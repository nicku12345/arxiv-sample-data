Let T be the unit circle in the complex plane C. This paper proves the existence of analytic structure in a compact subset K of T X C^n, where K has so-called "lineally convex" or "hypoconvex" fibers over T. It also addresses a related H-infinity optimization problem. The theorems here remove a number of unnatural assumptions required in an earlier work by the same author, "Polynomial hulls and H-infinity control for a hypoconvex constraint."
