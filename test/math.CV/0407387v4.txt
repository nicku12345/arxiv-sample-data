In this paper, a theory of realization and minimal factorization of rational matrix-valued functions which are J-unitary on the imaginary line or on the unit circle is extended to the setting of non-commutative rational formal power series. The property of J-unitarity holds on N-tuples of n\times n skew-Hermitian versus unitary matrices (n=1,2,...), and a rational formal power series is called \emph{matrix-J-unitary} in this case. The close relationship between minimal realizations and structured Hermitian solutions H of the Lyapunov or Stein equations is established. The results are specialized for the case of \emph{matrix-J-inner} rational formal power series. In this case H>0, however the proof of that is more elaborated than in the one-variable case and involves a new technique. For the rational \emph{matrix-inner} case, i.e., when J=I, the theorem of Ball, Groenewald and Malakorn on unitary realization of a formal power series from the non-commutative Schur--Agler class admits an improvement: its finite-dimensionality and uniqueness up to a unitary similarity is proved. A version of the theory for \emph{matrix-selfadjoint} rational formal power series is also presented. The concept of non-commutative formal reproducing kernel Pontryagin spaces is introduced, and in this framework the backward shift realization of a matrix-J-unitary rational formal power series in a finite-dimensional non-commutative de Branges--Rovnyak space is described.
