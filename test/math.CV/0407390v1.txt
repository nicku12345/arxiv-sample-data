This is an addendum to the paper ``Deformation of L_\infty-Algebras'' of the same author. We explain in which way the deformation theory of L_\infty-algebras extends the deformation theory of singularities. We show that the construction of semi-universal deformations of L_\infty-algebras gives explicit formal semi-universal deformations of isolated singularities.
