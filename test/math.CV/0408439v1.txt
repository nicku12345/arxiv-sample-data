In this paper, we study holomorphic vector bundles on (diagonal) Hopf manifolds. In particular, we give a description of moduli spaces of stable bundles on generic (non-elliptic) Hopf surfaces. We also give a classification of stable rank-2 vector bundles on generic Hopf manifolds of complex dimension greater than two.
