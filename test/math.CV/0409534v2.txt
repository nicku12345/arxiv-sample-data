Let z=(z_1, ..., z_n) and \Delta=\sum_{i=1}^n \fr {\p^2}{\p z^2_i} the Laplace operator. The main goal of the paper is to show that the well-known Jacobian conjecture without any additional conditions is equivalent to the following what we call {\it vanishing conjecture}: for any homogeneous polynomial P(z) of degree d=4, if \Delta^m P^m(z)=0 for all m \geq 1, then \Delta^m P^{m+1}(z)=0 when m>>0, or equivalently, \Delta^m P^{m+1}(z)=0 when m> \fr 32 (3^{n-2}-1). It is also shown in this paper that the condition \Delta^m P^m(z)=0 (m \geq 1) above is equivalent to the condition that P(z) is Hessian nilpotent, i.e. the Hessian matrix \Hes P(z)=(\fr {\p^2 P}{\p z_i\p z_j}) is nilpotent. The goal is achieved by using the recent breakthrough work of M. de Bondt, A. van den Essen \cite{BE1} and various results obtained in this paper on Hessian nilpotent polynomials. Some further results on Hessian nilpotent polynomials and the vanishing conjecture above are also derived.
