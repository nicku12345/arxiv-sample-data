We study the dynamics of a bimeromorphic selfmap of a compact complex K\"ahler surface X. Under a natural geometric hypothesis, we construct an invariant probability measure, which is mixing, hyperbolic and of maximal entropy. The proof relies heavily on the theory of laminar currents and is new even in the case of polynomial automorphisms of \mathbb{C}^2. This extends recent results by E. Bedford and J. Diller.
