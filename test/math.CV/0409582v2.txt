Let Gamma be a non-elementary Kleinian group acting on the closed n-dimensional unit ball and assume that its Poincare series converges at the exponent alpha. Let M_Gamma be the Gamma-quotient of the open unit ball. We consider certain families E = {E_1,...,E_p} of open subsets of M_Gamma such that M_Gamma minus the union of all E_i is compact. The sets E_i are called ends of M_Gamma and E is called a complete collection of ends for M_Gamma. We show that we can associate to each end in E a conformal measure of dimension alpha such that the two measures corresponding to different ends are mutually singular if non-trivial. Each conformal measure for Gamma of dimension alpha on the limit set Lambda(Gamma) of Gamma can be written as a sum of such conformal measures associated to ends in E. In dimension 3, our results overlap with some results of Bishop and Jones.
