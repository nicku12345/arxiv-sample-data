We study one-parameter curves on the universal Teichm\"uller space T and on the homogeneous space M=\Diff S^1/\Rot S^1 embedded into T. As a result, we deduce evolution equations for conformal maps that admit quasiconformal extensions and, in particular, such that the associated quasidisks are bounded by smooth Jordan curves. Some applications to Hele-Shaw flows of viscous fluids are given.
