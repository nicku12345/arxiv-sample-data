Let S stand for the usual class of univalent regular functions in the unit disk U=\{z: |z|<1\} normalized by f(z)=z+a_2z^2+... in U, and let S^M be its subclass defined by restricting |f(z)|<M in U, M\geq 1. We consider two classical problems: Bombieri's coefficient problem for the class S and the sharp estimate of the fourth coefficient of a function from S^M. Using L\"owner's parametric representation and the optimal control method we give exact initial Bombieri's numbers and derive a sharp constant M_0, such that for all M\geq M_0 the Pick function gives the local maximum to |a_4|. Numerical approximation is given.
