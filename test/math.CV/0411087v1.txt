In this paper we present a simple method for deriving recurrence relations and we apply it to obtain two equations involving the Lerch Phi function and sums of Bernoulli and Euler polynomials. Connections between these results and those obtained in a paper of H.M. Srivastava, M.L. Glasser and V. Adamchik are pointed out, emphasizing the usefulness of this approach with some meaningful examples.
