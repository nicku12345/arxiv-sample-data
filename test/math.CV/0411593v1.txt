We show that for every \epsilon>0, there exists a compact lamination by \epsilon-holomorphic surfaces in the complex projective plane, minimal, and that carries hyperbolic holonomy. We call \epsilon-holomorphic a real 2-dimensional surface \Sigma in {\bf C}P^2 such that the angle between T\Sigma and iT\Sigma is uniformly bounded by \epsilon. When \epsilon is sufficiently small, such surfaces are in particular symplectic.
