We prove that a connected properly immersed minimal surface in Euclidean 3-space with infinite symmetry group whose intersection with a ball of radius R is less than 2\piR^2 is a plane, a catenoid or a Scherk singly-periodic minimal surface. In particular, we prove that the only periodic minimal desingularization of a pair of intersecting planes is Scherk's singly-periodic minimal surface.
