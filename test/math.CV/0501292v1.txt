In this paper, we study a notion of hyperbolicity for hyperbolicity foliations with 1-dimensional parabolic leaves, namely the non-existence of holomorphic cylinders along the foliation - holomorphic maps from \D^{n-1} \times \C to the manifold sending each \{*\} \times \C to a leaf. We construct a tensor, that is a leaf-wise holomorphic section of a bundle above the foliated manifold, which vanishes on an open saturated set if and only if there exists such a cylinder through each point of this open set. Thanks to this study, we prove that open sets saturated by compact leaves are union of holomorphic cylinders along the foliation. We also give some more specific results and examples in the case of a compact manifold, and of foliations with one compact leaf or without any compact leaves.
