This paper deals with proper holomorphic self-maps of smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domains in \C^2. We study the dynamical properties of their extension to the boundary and show that their non-wandering sets are always contained in the weakly pseudoconvex part of the boundary. In the case of complete circular domains, we combine this fact with an entropy/degree argument to show that the maps are automorphisms. Some of our results remain true in \C^n.
