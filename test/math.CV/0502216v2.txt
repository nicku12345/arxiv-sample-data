We give here a description of the motivic Poincare series in case of irreducible quasi-ordinary hypersurfaces in all dimension. We give an explicit formula in a particular case. Finally, for such singularities, we give a constructive proof of a result of rationnality of such series proved by Denef and Loeser in all generality.
