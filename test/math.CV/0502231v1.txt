We consider a commutative family of holomorphic vector fields in an neighbourhood of a common singular point, say 0\in \Bbb C^n. Let \lie g be a commutative complex Lie algebra of dimension l. Let \lambda_1,...,\lambda_n\in \lie g^* and let us set S(g)=\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i(g)x_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}. We assume that this Lie morphism is {\bf diophantine} in the sense that a diophantine condition (\omega(S)) is satisfied. Let X_1 be a holomorphic vector field in a neighbourhood of 0\in \Bbb C^n. We assume that its linear part s is regular relatively to S, that is belongs to S(\lie g) and has the same formal centralizer as S. Let X_2,..., X_l be holomorphic vector fields vanishing at 0 and commuting with X_1. Then there exists a formal diffeomorphism of (\Bbb C^n,0) such that the family of vector fields are in {\bf normal form} in these formal coordinates. This means that each element of the family commutes with s. We show that, if the normal forms of the X_i's belongs to \hat {\cal O}_n^S\otimes S(\lie g) (\hat {\cal O}_n^S is the ring of formal first integrals of S) and their junior parts are free over \hat {\cal O}_n^S, then there exists a holomorphic diffeomorphism of (\Bbb C^n,0) which transforms the family into a normal form. The elements of the family, but one, may not have a non-zero linear part at the origin.
