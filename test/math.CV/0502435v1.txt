We set new dual problems for the weighted spaces of holomorphic functions of one variable in domains on the complex plane, namely: nontriviallity of a given space, description of zero sets, description of (non-)uniqueness sets, the representation of meromorphic functions as a quotient of holomorphic functions from a given space.
