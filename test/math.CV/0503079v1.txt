Given a random sequence of holomorphic maps f_1,f_2,f_3,... of the unit disk \Delta to a subdomain X, we consider the compositions F_n=f_1 \circ f_{2} \circ ... f_{n-1} \circ f_n.   The sequence \{F_n\} is called the {\em iterated function system} coming from the sequence f_1,f_2,f_3,.... We prove that a sufficient condition on the domain X for all limit functions of any \{F_n\} to be constant is also necessary. We prove the condition is a quasiconformal invariant. Finally, we address the question of uniqueness of limit functions.
