Let \phi(z)=(\phi_1(z),...,\phi_n(z)) be a holomorphic self-map of B and \psi(z) a holomorphic function on B, where B is the unit ball of {\Bbbb C}^n. Let 0<p,s<+\infty, -n-1<q<+\infty, q+s>-1 and \alpha\geq 0, this paper gives some necessary and sufficient conditions for the weighted composition operator \wco induced by \phi and \psi to be bounded and compact between the space \Fs and \alpha-{\sl Bloch} space \beta^\alpha.
