We prove new theorems which are higher-dimensional generalizations of the classical theorems of Siegel on integral points on affine curves and of Picard on holomorphic maps from \mathbb{C} to affine curves. These include results on integral points over varying number fields of bounded degree and results on Kobayashi hyperbolicity. We give a number of new conjectures describing, from our point of view, how we expect Siegel's and Picard's theorems to optimally generalize to higher dimensions. In some special cases we will be able to relate our conjectures to existing conjectures. In this respect, we are also led to formulate a new conjecture relating the absolute discriminant and height of an algebraic point on a projective variety over a number field.
