Let U^{n} be the unit polydisc of {\Bbb C}^{n} and \phi=(\phi_1, >..., \phi_n) a holomorphic self-map of U^{n}. By {\cal B}^p(U^{n}), {\cal B}^p_{0}(U^{n}) and {\cal B}^p_{0*}(U^{n}) denote the p-Bloch space, Little p-Bloch space and Little star p-Bloch space in the unit polydisc U^n respectively, where p, q>0. This paper gives the estimates of the essential norms of bounded composition operators C_{\phi} induced by \phi between {\cal B}^p(U^n) ({\cal B}^p_{0}(U^n) or {\cal B}^p_{0*}(U^n)) and {\cal B}^q(U^n) ({\cal B}^q_{0}(U^n) or {\cal B}^q_{0*}(U^n)). As their applications, some necessary and sufficient conditions for the bounded composition operators C_{\phi} to be compact from {\cal B}^p(U^n) ({\cal B}^p_{0}(U^n) or {\cal B}^p_{0*}(U^n)) into {\cal B}^q(U^n) ({\cal B}^q_{0}(U^n) or {\cal B}^q_{0*}(U^n)) are obtained.
