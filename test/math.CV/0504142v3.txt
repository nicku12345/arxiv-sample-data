We analyze the structure of the algebraic manifolds Y of dimension 3 with H^i(Y, \Omega^j_Y)=0 for all j\geq 0, i>0 and h^0(Y, {\mathcal{O}}_Y) > 1, by showing the deformation invariant of some open surfaces. Secondly, we show when a smooth threefold with nonconstant regular functions satisfies the vanishing Hodge cohomology. As an application, we prove the existence of nonaffine and nonproduct threefolds Y with this property by constructing a family of a certain type of open surfaces parametrized by the affine curve \C-\{0\} such that the corresponding smooth completion X has Kodaira dimension -\infty and D-dimension 1, where D is the effective boundary divisor with support X-Y.
