This article discusses the geometric application of the method of multiplier ideal sheaves. It first briefly describes its application to effective problems in algebraic geometry and then presents and explains its application to the deformational invariance of plurigenera for general compact algebraic manifolds. Finally its application to the conjecture of the finite generation of the canonical ring is explored and the use of complex algebraic geometry in complex Neumann estimates is discussed.
