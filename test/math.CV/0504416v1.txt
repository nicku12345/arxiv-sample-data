For a convex domain K in the complex plane, the well-known general Bernstein-Markov inequality holds asserting that a polynomial p of degree n must have ||p'|| < c(K) n^2 ||p||. On the other hand for polynomials in general, ||p'|| can be arbitrarily small as compared to ||p||.   The situation changes when we assume that the polynomials in question have all their zeroes in the convex body K. This was first investigated by Tur\'an, who showed the lower bounds ||p'|| \ge (n/2) ||p|| for the unit disk D and ||p'|| > c \sqrt{n} ||p|| for the unit interval I:=[-1,1]. Although partial results provided general lower estimates of lower order, as well as certain classes of domains with lower bounds of order n, it was not clear what order of magnitude the general convex domains may admit here.   Here we show that for all compact and convex domains K with nonempty interior and polynomials p with all their zeroes in K ||p'|| > c(K) n ||p|| holds true, while ||p'|| < C(K) n ||p|| occurs for any K. Actually, we determine c(K) and C(K) within a factor of absolute numerical constant.
