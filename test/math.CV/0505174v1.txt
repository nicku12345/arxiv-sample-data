In the paper it is discussed the relations of the Riemann \zeta-function to classes of generating functions of multiply positive sequences according to Schoenberg (also called P\'olya frequency sequences).   Key words: multiply positive sequences, totally positive sequences, P\'olya frequency sequences, Laguerre-P\'olya class, Riemann \zeta-function.
