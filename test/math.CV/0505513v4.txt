We determine the limit distribution (as \lambda \to \infty) of complex zeros for holomorphic continuations \phi_{\lambda}^{\C} to Grauert tubes of real eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a real analytic compact Riemannian manifold (M, g) with ergodic geodesic flow. If \{\phi_{j_k} \} is an ergodic sequence of eigenfunctions, we prove the weak limit formula \frac{1}{\lambda_j} [Z_{\phi_{j_k}^{\C}}] \to \frac{i}{\pi} \bar{\partial} {\partial} |\xi|_g, where  [Z_{\phi_{j_k}^{\C}}] is the current of integration over the complex zeros and where \bar{\partial} is with respect to the adapted complex structure of Lempert-Sz\"oke and Guillemin-Stenzel.
