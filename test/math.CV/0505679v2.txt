We give here a result of diophantine approximation between \O_N, the ring of power series in several variables, and the completion of the valuation ring that dominates \O_N for the \m-adic topology. We deduce from this that the Artin function of a homogenous polynomial in two variables is bounded by an affine function, which can be interpreted in term of a Lojasiewicz inequality on the wedges space.
