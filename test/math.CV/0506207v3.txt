In this paper we consider alternating Kurepa's function A(z) \cite{Petojevic_02}. We give some recurrent relations for alternating Kurepa's function via appropriate sequences of rational functions and gamma function. Also we give some inequalities for the real part of alternating Kurepa's function A(x) for values of argument x>-2. The obtained results are analogous to results from \cite{Malesevc_04}.
