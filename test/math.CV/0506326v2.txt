Exact and asymptotic formulae are displayed for the coefficients \lambda_n used in Li's criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis. For n \to \infty we obtain that if (and only if) the Hypothesis is true, \lambda_n \sim n(A \log n +B) (with A>0 and B explicitly given, also for the case of more general zeta or L-functions); whereas in the opposite case, \lambda_n has a non-tempered oscillatory form.
