When 0<p<1, it is known that the p-Bloch and (1-p)-Lipschitz spaces of the unit ball in n-dimensional complex Eucllidean space are equal as sets. We prove that these spaces are additionally norm-equivalent, thus extending known results for n=1 and the polydisk. As an application, we generalize work by Madigan on the disk by investigating boundedness of composition operators between p- and q-Lipschitz spaces of the ball.
