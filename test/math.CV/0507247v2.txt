Let D be a bounded strongly convex domain in the complex space of dimension n. Fixed a point p\in \partial D, we consider the solution of a homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere equation with simple pole at p. We prove that such a solution enjoys many properties of the classical Poisson kernel in the unit disc and thus deserves to be called the pluricomplex Poisson kernel of D with pole at p. In particular we discuss extremality properties (such as a generalization of the classical Phragmen-Lindelof theorem), relations with the pluricomplex Green function of D, uniqueness in terms of the associated foliation and boundary behaviors and reproducing formulas for plurisubharmonic functions.
