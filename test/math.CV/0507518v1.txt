We realize norms of most composition operators acting on the Hardy space with linear fractional symbol as roots of hypergeometric functions. This realization leads to simple necessary and sufficient conditions on the symbol to exhibit extremal non-compactness, establishes equivalence of cohyponormality and cosubnormality of composition operators with linear fractional symbol, and yields a complete classification of those linear fractional that induce composition operators whose norms are determined by the action of the adjoint on the normalized reproducing kernels in the Hardy space.
