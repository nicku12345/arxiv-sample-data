We establish a formula for the sum of the Lyapounov exponents of an holomorphic endomorphism of {\bf P}^k. For an holomorphic family of such endomorphisms we define the {\em bifurcation current} as dd^cL and show that it vanishes when the repulsive cycles move holomorphically. We then prove a formula which relates this current with the interaction between the Green current and the current of integration on the critical set. In the 1-dimensional case (i.e. for {\bf P}^1) we find a geometrical description of the support of this current and its powers. Finally we introduce the {\em bifurcation measure} giving some applications. This last part may be interpreted as a generalization of Mane-Sad-Sullivan theory based on pluri-potentialist methods.
