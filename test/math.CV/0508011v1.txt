We study real-analytic Levi degenerate hypersurfaces M in complex manifolds of dimension 3, for which the CR-automorphism group Aut(M) is a real Lie group acting transitively on M. We provide large classes of examples for such M, compute the corresponding groups Aut(M) and determine the maximal subsets of M that cannot be separated by global continuous CR-functions. It turns out that all our examples, although partly arising in different contexts, are locally CR-equivalent to the tube over the future light cone in 3-dimensional space-time.
