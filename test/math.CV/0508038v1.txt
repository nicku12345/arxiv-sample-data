Moduli spaces of holomorphic disks in a complex manifold Z, with boundaries constrained to lie in a maximal totally real submanifold P, have recently been found to underlie a number of geometrically rich twistor correspondences. The purpose of this paper is to develop a general Fredholm regularity criterion for holomorphic curves-with-boundary, and then show how this applies, in particular, to various moduli problems of twistor-theoretic interest.
