We prove that the zeta-function \zeta_\Delta of the Laplacian \Delta on a self-similar fractals with spectral decimation admits a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. We characterise the poles, compute their residues, and give expressions for some special values of the zeta-function. Furthermore, we discuss the presence of oscillations in the eigenvalue counting function.
