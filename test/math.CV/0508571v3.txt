Let p:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{R} be a subharmonic, nonharmonic polynomial and \tau a real parameter. Define \bar{Z}_{\tau p} = \partial_{\bar z} + \tau p_{\bar z}, a closed, densely-defined operator on L^2(\mathbb{C}). If \Box_{\tau p} = \bar{Z}_{\tau p}\bar{Z}_{\tau p}^* and \tau>0, we solve the heat equation  (\partial_s + \Box_{\tau p}) u =0, u(0,z) = f(z), on (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{C}. The solution comes via the heat semigroup e^{-s\Box_{\tau p}}, and we show that u(s,z) is given as integration of the intial condition against a distributional kernel H_{\tau p}(s,z,w). We prove that H_{\tau p} is C^\infty off the diagonal \{(s,z,w):s=0 \text{and }z=w\} and that H_{\tau p} and its derivatives have exponential decay.
