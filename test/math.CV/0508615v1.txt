This paper uses the theory of integral closure of modules to study the sections of both real and complex analytic spaces. The stratification conditions used are the (t^) conditions introduced by Thom and Trotman.   Our results include a new simple proof showing how the (t^r) conditions improve under Grassman modification, and a characterization of the (t^r) conditions using the multiplicity of a submodule of the Jacobian module of the singularity. This gives numerical criteria for Verdier Equisingularity of families of sections of the space.
