In this paper we determine all Kobayashi-hyperbolic 2-dimensional complex manifolds for which the group of holomorphic automorphisms has dimension 3. This work concludes a recent series of papers by the author on the classification of hyperbolic n-dimensional manifolds, with automorphism group of dimension at least n^2-1, where n\ge 2.
