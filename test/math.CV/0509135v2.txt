Let K be any unital commutative \bQ-algebra and z=(z_1, z_2, ..., z_n) commutative or noncommutative variables. Let t be a formal central parameter and \kttzz the formal power series algebra of z over K[[t]]. In \cite{GTS-II}, for each automorphism F_t(z)=z-H_t(z) of \kttzz with H_{t=0}(z)=0 and o(H(z))\geq 1, a \cNcs (noncommutative symmetric) system (\cite{GTS-I}) \Oft has been constructed. Consequently, we get a Hopf algebra homomorphism \cSft: \cNsf \to \cDzz from the Hopf algebra \cNsf (\cite{G-T}) of NCSF's (noncommutative symmetric functions). In this paper, we first give a list for the identities between any two sequences of differential operators in the \cNcs system \Oft by using some identities of NCSF's derived in \cite{G-T} and the homomorphism \cSft. Secondly, we apply these identities to derive some formulas in terms of differential operator in the system \Oft for the Taylor series expansions of u(F_t) and u(F_t^{-1}) (u(z)\in \kttzz); the D-Log and the formal flow of F_t and inversion formulas for the inverse map of F_t. Finally, we discuss a connection of the well-known Jacobian conjecture with NCSF's.
