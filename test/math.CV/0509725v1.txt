We introduce a new equivalence relation, denoted by A.Q.E.D. (= Algebraic-Quasi-\'Etale- Deformation) for complete algebraic varieties with canonical singularities: it is generated by birational equivalence, by flat algebraic deformations, and by quasi-\'etale morphisms, i.e., morphisms which are unramified in codimension 1. \C-Q.E.D is the similar relation for compact complex manifolds and spaces. By a recent theorem of Siu dimension and Kodaira dimension are invariants for A.Q.E.D.. The question whether conversely two algebraic varieties of the same dimension and with the same Kodaira dimension are Q.E.D. -equivalent has a positive answer for curves and using Enriques' classification we show that the answer to the \C-Q.E.D. question is positive for special algebraic surfaces (Kodaira dimension at most 1) and for compact complex surfaces with Kodaira dimension 0, 1 and even first Betti number. The appendix by S\"onke Rollenske shows that the same does not hold if we allow odd first Betti number( Kodaira surfaces form a single class). The answer to the A.Q.E.D. question is yes for special complex algebraic surfaces, while the appendix due to Fritz Grunewald shows that the answer is no for surfaces of general type. Because the (rigid) Kuga-Shavel type surfaces of general type obtained as quotients of the bidisk via discrete groups constructed from quaternion algebras belong to countably many distinct Q.E.D. equivalence classes.
