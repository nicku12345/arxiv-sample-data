The paper deals with a complex polynomial H in two variables having   - a generic highest homogeneous part (without multiple zero lines),   - nonconstant lower terms.   In particular, under these conditions the polynomial H has at least two distinct critical values. We prove quantitative versions of this statement. Supposing H appropriately normalized (by affine coordinate changes in the image and in the source) we prove upper bounds for the following quantities:   - the sum of the coefficients of the lower terms;   - the minimal size of a bidisc containing all the nontrivial topology of a given level curve S_t=\{ H=t\};   - the minimal lengths of representatives of cycles in H_1(S_t,\zz) vanishing along appropriate paths from t to the critical values of H;   - the intersection indices of the latter cycles.   All these results (expect for the latter bound) are used in my joint work with Yu.S.Ilyashenko "Restricted version of the Hilbert 16-th problem" (available on the arxiv). In the latter paper we obtain an explicit upper bound of the number of zeros for a wide class of Abelian integrals.
