A theory of global regularity of the d-bar-Neumann operator is developed which unifies the two principal approaches to date, namely the one via compactness due to Kohn-Nirenberg and Catlin, and the one via plurisubharmonic defining functions and/or vector fields that commute approximately with d-bar due to Boas and the author.
