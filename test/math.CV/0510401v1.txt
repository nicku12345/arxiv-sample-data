We proved recently math.CA/0510403 that the anti-analytic part of a trigonometric series, converging to zero almost everywhere, may be square integrable on the circle. Here we prove that it can even be infinitely differentiable, and we characterize precisely the possible degree of smoothness in terms of the rate of decrease of the Fourier coefficients. This sharp condition might be viewed as a "new quasi-analyticity".
