The paper concerns numerical algorithms for solving the Beltrami equation f_{\bar{z}}(z)=\mu(z) f_z(z) for a compactly supported \mu. First, we study an efficient algorithm that has been proposed in the literature, and present its rigorous justification. We then propose a different scheme for solving the Beltrami equation which has a comparable speed and accuracy, but has the virtue of a greater simplicity of implementation.
