Let L be a (semi)-positive line bundle over a Kahler manifold, X, fibered over a complex manifold Y. Assuming the fibers are compact and non-singular we prove that the hermitian vector bundle E over Y whose fibers over points y are the spaces of global sections over X_y to L\gr K_{X/Y} endowed with the L^2-metric is (semi)-positive in the sense of Nakano. We also discuss various applications, among them a partial result on a conjecture of Griffiths on the positivity of ample bundles. This is a revised and much expanded version of a previous preprint with the title `` Bergman kernels and the curvature of vector bundles''.
