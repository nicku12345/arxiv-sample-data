Let \Delta ^{n} be the ball |x|<1 in the complex vector space \mathbb{C}% ^{n}, let f:\Delta ^{n}\to \mathbb{C}^{n} be a holomorphic mapping and let M be a positive integer. Assume that the origin % 0=(0,..., 0) is an isolated fixed point of both f and the M-th iteration f^{M} of f. Then for each factor m of M, the origin is again an isolated fixed point of f^{m} and the fixed point index \mu_{f^{m}}(0) of f^{m} at the origin is well defined, and so is the (local) Dold's index (see [\ref{Do}]) at the origin:% \begin{equation*} P_{M}(f,0)=\sum_{\tau \subset P(M)}(-1)^{#\tau}\mu_{f^{M:\tau}}(0), \end{equation*}% where P(M) is the set of all primes dividing M, the sum extends over all subsets \tau  of P(M), #\tau is the cardinal number of \tau  and % M:\tau =M(\prod_{p\in \tau}p)^{-1}.   P_{M}(f,0) can be interpreted to be the number of periodic points of period M of f overlapped at the origin: any holomorphic mapping % f_{1}:\Delta ^{n}\to \mathbb{C}^{n} sufficiently close to f has exactly P_{M}(f,0) distinct periodic points of period M near the origin%,  provided that all the fixed points of f_{1}^{M} near the origin are simple. Note that f itself has no periodic point of period M near the origin.   According to M. Shub and D. Sullivan's work [\ref{SS}], a necessary condition so that P_{M}(f,0)\neq 0 is that the linear part of f at the origin has a periodic point of period M. The goal of this paper is to prove that this condition is sufficient as well for holomorphic mappings.
