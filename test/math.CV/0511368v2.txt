Let u be a pluriharmonic function on the unit ball in \mathbb{C}^n. I consider the relationship between the set of points L_u on the boundary of the ball at which u converges nontangentially and the set of points \mathcal{L}_u at which u converges along conditioned Brownian paths. For harmonic functions u of two variables, the result L_u\stackrel{\mathrm{a.e.}}{=}\mathcal{L}_u has been known for some time, as has a counterexample to the same equality for three variable harmonic functions. I extend the L_u\stackrel{\mathrm{a.e.}}{=}\mathcal{L}_u result to pluriharmonic functions in arbitrary dimensions.
