We establish the existence of the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel associated to the spin-c Dirac operators acting on high tensor powers of line bundles with non-degenerate mixed curvature (negative and positive eigenvalues) by extending the paper " On the asymptotic expansion of Bergman kernel " (math.DG/0404494) of Dai-Liu-Ma. We compute the second coefficient b_1 in the asymptotic expansion using the method of our paper "Generalized Bergman kernels on symplectic manifolds" (math.DG/0411559).
