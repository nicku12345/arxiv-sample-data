We extend a classical result of Caughran/Schwartz and another recent result of Gunatillake by showing that if D is a bounded, convex domain in n-dimensional complex space, m is a holomorphic function on D and bounded away from zero toward the boundary of D, and p is a holomorphic self-map of D such that the weighted composition operator W assigning the product of m and the composition of f and p to a given function f is compact on a holomorphic functional Hilbert space (containing the polynomial functions densely) on D with reproducing kernel K blowing up along the diagonal of D toward its boundary, then p has a unique fixed point in D. We apply this result by making a reasonable conjecture about the spectrum of W based on previous one-variable and multivariable results concerning compact weighted and unweighted composition operators.
