Let M of real dimension 2n-1 be a compact, orientable, weakly pseudoconvex manifold of dimension at least five, embedded in C^N (n less than or equal to N), of codimension one or more in C^N, and endowed with the induced CR structure. We show the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator has closed range on such a manifold M, hence we get global existence and regularity results for the \bar\partial_b problem. We also show the middle (i.e. corresponding to (p,q) forms for q between 1 and n-2) \bar\partial_b cohomology groups of M with respect to L^2, Sobolev s, and smooth coefficients are finite and isomorphic to each other. The results are obtained by microlocalization using a new type of weight function called strongly CR plurisubharmonic.
