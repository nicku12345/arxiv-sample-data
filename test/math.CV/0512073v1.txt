Let M be a smooth, compact, orientable, weakly pseudoconvex manifold of dimension 3, embedded in C^N (N greater than or equal to 2), of codimension one or more in C^N, and endowed with the induced CR structure. Assuming that the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator \bar\partial_b has closed range in L^2 in order to rule out the Rossi example, we push regularity up to show \bar\partial_b has closed range in all Sobolev spaces s for s greater than zero. We then use the Szeg\"{o} projection to show there is a smooth solution to the \bar\partial_b problem given smooth data. The results are obtained via microlocalization by piecing together estimates for functions and (0,1) forms that hold on different microlocal regions.
