We define a complex connection on a real hypersurface of \C^{n+1} which is naturally inherited from the ambient space. Using a system of Codazzi-type equations, we classify connected real hypersurfaces in \C^{n+1}, n\ge 2, which are Levi umbilical and have non zero constant Levi curvature. It turns out that such surfaces are contained either in a sphere or in the boundary of a complex tube domain with spherical section.
