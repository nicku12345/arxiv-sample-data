We show in this note that for a germ g of holomorphic function with an isolated singularity at the origin of \mathbb{C}^n there is a pole for the meromorphic extension of the distribution \begin{equation*}   \frac{1}{\Gamma(\lambda)} \int_X | g |^{2\lambda}\bar{g}^{-n} \square \tag{*}   \end{equation*} at - n - \alpha when  \alpha is the smallest root in its class modulo \mathbb{Z} of the reduce Bernstein-Sato polynomial of g. This is rather unexpected result comes from the fact that the self-duality of the Brieskorn (a,b)-module E_g associated to g exchanges the biggest simple pole sub-(a,b)-module of E_g with the saturation of E_g by b^{-1}a. In the first part of this note, we prove that the biggest simple pole sub-(a,b)-module of the Briekorn (a,b)-module E of g is "geometric" in the sense that it depends only on the hypersurface germ \{g = 0 \} at the origin in \mathbb{C}^n and not on the precise choice of the reduced equation g, as the poles of (*). By duality, we deduce the same property for the saturation \tilde{E} of E. This duality gives also the relation between the "dual" Bernstein-Sato polynomial and the usual one, which is the key of the proof of the theorem.
