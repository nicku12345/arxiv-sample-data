For meromorphic maps of complex manifolds, ergodic theory and pluripotential theory are closely related. In nice enough situations, dynamically defined Green's functions give rise to invariant currents which intersect to yield measures of maximal entropy. `Nice enough' is often a condition on the regularity of the Green's function. In this paper we look at a variety of regularity properties that have been considered for dynamical Green's functions. We simplify and extend some known results and prove several others which are entirely new. We also give some examples indicating the limits of what one can hope to achieve in complex dynamics by relying solely on the regularity of a dynamical Green's function.
