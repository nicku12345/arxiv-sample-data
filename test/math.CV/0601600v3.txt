Let S(n,0) be the set of monic complex polynomials of degree n\ge 2 having all their zeros in the closed unit disk and vanishing at 0. For p\in S(n,0) denote by |p|_{0} the distance from the origin to the zero set of p'. We determine all 0-maximal polynomials of degree n, that is, all polynomials p\in S(n,0) such that |p|_{0}\ge |q|_{0} for any q\in S(n,0). Using a second order variational method we then show that although some of these polynomials are linearly inextensible, they are not locally maximal for Sendov's conjecture.
