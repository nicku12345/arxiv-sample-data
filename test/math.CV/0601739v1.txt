Let M_1 and M_2 be two K\"ahler manifolds. We call M_1 and M_2 {\em relatives} if they share a non-trivial K\"ahler submanifold S, namely, if there exist two holomorphic and isometric immersions (K\"ahler immersions) h_1: S\to M_1 and h_2: S\to M_2. Moreover, two K\"ahler manifolds M_1 and M_2 are said to be {\em weakly relatives} if there exist two locally isometric (not necessarily holomorphic) K\"ahler manifolds S_1 and S_2 which admit two K\"ahler immersions into M_1 and M_2 respectively. The notions introduced are not equivalent. Our main results in this paper are Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4. In the first theorem we show that a complex bounded domain with its Bergman metric and a projective K\"ahler manifold (i.e. a projective manifold endowed with the restriction of the Fubini--Study metric) are not relatives. In the second theorem we prove that a Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type and a projective K\"ahler manifold are not weakly relatives. The proof of the second result does not follows trivially from the first one. We also remark that the above results are of local nature, i.e. no assumptions are used about the compactness or completeness of the manifolds involved. As a corollary we get that Hermitian symmetric spaces of different types are not weakly relatives.
