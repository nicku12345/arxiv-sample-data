In this article, we investigate the resurgent properties of the WKB solutions for a singularly perturbated second order ordinary differential equation. In particular, we extend and propose a new proof of a theorem due to Aoki (et al) near a simple turning point, in the framework of the exact WKB analysis. Our scheme of proof is based on a Laplace-integral representation derived from an existence theorem of holomorphic solutions for a linear singular partial differential equation.
