We estimate the Hoelder exponent \alpha of solutions to the Beltrami equation \dbar f=\mu\de f, where the Beltrami coefficient satisfies \|\mu\|_\infty<1. Our estimate improves the classical estimate \alpha\ge\|K_\mu\|^{-1}, where K_\mu=(1+|\mu|)/(1-|\mu|), and it is sharp, in the sense that it is actually attained in a class of mappings which generalize the radial stretchings. Some other properties of such mappings are also provided.
