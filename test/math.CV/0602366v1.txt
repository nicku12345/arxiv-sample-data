We consider classes  \mathcal{A}_M(S)  of functions holomorphic in an open plane sector  S  and belonging to a strongly non-quasianalytic class on the closure of  S . In  \mathcal{A}_M(S) , we construct functions which are flat at the vertex of  S  with a sharp rate of vanishing. This allows us to obtain a Borel-Ritt type theorem for  \mathcal{A}_M(S)  extending previous results by Schmets and Valdivia. We also derive a division property for ideals of flat ultradifferentiable functions, in the spirit of a classical  C^\infty  result of Tougeron.
