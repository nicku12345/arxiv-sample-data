We study the probability that chordal \text{SLE}_{8/3} in the unit disk from \exp(ix) to 1 avoids the disk of radius q centered at zero. We find the initial/boundary-value problem satisfied by this probability as a function of x and a=\ln q, and show that asymptotically as q tends to one this probability decays like \exp(-cx/(1-q)) with c=5\pi/8 for x\in[0,\pi]. We also give a representation of this probability as a functional of a Legendre process.
