Functions of several octonion variables are investigated and integral representation theorems for them are proved. With the help of them solutions of the {\tilde {\partial}}-equations are studied. More generally functions of several Cayley-Dickson variables are considered. Integral formulas of the Martinelli-Bochner, Leray, Koppelman type used in complex analysis here are proved in the new generalized form for functions of Cayley-Dickson variables instead of complex. Moreover, analogs of Stein manifolds over Cayley-Dickson graded algebras are defined and investigated.
