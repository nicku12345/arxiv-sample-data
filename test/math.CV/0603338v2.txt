We give explicit MacPherson cycles for the Chern-MacPherson class of a closed affine algebraic variety X and for any constructible function \alpha with respect to a complex algebraic Whitney stratification of X.   We define generalized degrees of the global polar varieties and of the MacPherson cycles and we prove a global index formula for the Euler characteristic of \alpha.   Whenever \alpha is the Euler obstruction of X, this index formula specializes to the Seade-Tibar-Verjovsky global counterpart of the Le-Teissier formula for the local Euler obstruction.
