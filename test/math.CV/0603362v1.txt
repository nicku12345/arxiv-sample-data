In 1986 A. Ancona showed, using the Koebe one-quarter Theorem, that for a simply-connected planar domain the constant in the Hardy inequality with the distance to the boundary is greater than or equal to 1/16. In this paper we consider classes of domains for which there is a stronger version of the Koebe Theorem. This implies better estimates for the constant appearing in the Hardy inequality.
