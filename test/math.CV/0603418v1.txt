Let {\mathcal X} be the space of type-preserving \SL(2,C) characters of the punctured torus T. The Bowditch space {\mathcal X}_{BQ} is the largest open subset of {\mathcal X} on which the mapping class group acts properly discontinuously, this is characterized by two simple conditions called the BQ-conditions. In this note, we show that [\rho] is in the interior of the complement of {\mathcal X}_{BQ} if there exists an essential simple closed curve X on T such that |{\rm tr} \rho(X)|<0.5.
