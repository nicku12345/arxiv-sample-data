There is no general existence theorem for solutions for nonlinear difference equations, so we must prove the existence of solutions in accordance with models one by one.   In our work, we found theorems for the existence of analytic solutions of nonlinear second order difference equations. The main work of the present paper is obtaining representations of analytic general solutions with new methods of complex analysis.
