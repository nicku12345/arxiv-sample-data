Improved local and global versions of the effective Nullstellensatz for ideal sheaves on non-singular complex varieties are obtained, based on a new invariant motivated by the notion of finite type from the theory of several complex variables. Two closely related curve selection theorems for curves with maximal adjusted tangency orders to a given ideal sheaf are established along the way, using normalized blow-ups and integral closures.
