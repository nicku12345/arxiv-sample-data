We consider a class of Gaussian random holomorphic functions, whose expected zero set is uniformly distributed over \C^n . This class is unique (up to multiplication by a non zero holomorphic function), and is closely related to a Gaussian field over a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on the reduced Heisenberg group. For a fixed random function of this class, we show that the probability that there are no zeros in a ball of large radius, is less than e^{-c_1 r^{2n+2}}, and is also greater than e^{-c_2 r^{2n+2}}. Enroute to this result we also compute probability estimates for the event that a random function's unintegrated counting function deviates significantly from its mean.
