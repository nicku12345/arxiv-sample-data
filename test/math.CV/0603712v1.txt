We study the hyperbolicity of the log variety (\mathbb{P}^n, X), where X is a very general hypersurface of degree d\geq 2n+1 (which is the bound predicted by the Kobayashi conjecture). Using a positivity result for the sheaf of (twisted) logarithmic vector fields, which may be of independent interest, we show that any log-subvariety of (\mathbb{P}^n, X) is of log-general type, give a new proof of the algebraic hyperbolicity of (\mathbb{P}^n, X), and exclude the existence of maximal rank families of entire curves in the complement of the universal degree d hypersurface. Moreover, we prove that, as in the compact case, the algebraic hyperbolicity of a log-variety is a necessary condition for the metric one.
