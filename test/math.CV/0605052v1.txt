Let B be a meromorphic Blaschke product in the upper half-plane with zeros z_n and let K_B=H^2\ominus BH^2 be the associated model subspace of the Hardy class. In other words, K_B is the space of square summable meromorphic functions with the poles at the points \bar z_n. A nonnegative function w on the real line is said to be an admissible majorant for K_B if there is a non-zero function f\in K_B such that |f|\le w a.e. on \mathbb{R}. We study the relations between the distribution of the zeros of a Blaschke product B and the class of admissible majorants for the space K_B.
