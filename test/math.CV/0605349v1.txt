Let p:C\to R be a subharmonic, nonharmonic polynomial and \tau\in R a parameter. Define \bar Z_{\tau p} = \partial_{\bar z} + \tau p_{\bar z} = e^{-\tau p} p_{\bar z} e^{\tau p}, a closed, densely defined operator on L^2(C). If \Box_{\tau p} = \bar Z_{\tau p}\bar Z^*_{\tau p} and \tilde\Box_{\tau p} = \bar Z^*_{\tau p}\bar Z_{\tau p}, we solve the heat equations \partial_s u + \Box_{\tau p} u=0, u(0,z)=f(z) and \partial_s \tilde u + \tilde\Box_{\tau p} \tilde u=0, \tilde u(0,z) = \tilde f(z). We write the solutions via heat semigroups and show that the solutions can be written as integrals against distributional kernels. We prove that the kernels are C^\infty off of the diagonal \{(s,z,w) : s=0 \text{and} z=w\} and find pointwise bounds for the kernels and their derivatives.
