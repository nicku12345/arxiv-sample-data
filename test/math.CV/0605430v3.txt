In this paper we consider some analytical relations between gamma function \Gamma(z) and related functions such as the Kurepa's function K(z) and alternating Kurepa's function A(z). It is well-known in the physics that the Casimir energy is defined by the principal part of the Riemann function \zeta(z) (Blau, Visser, Wipf; Elizalde). Analogously, we consider the principal parts for functions \Gamma(z), K(z), A(z) and we also define and consider the principal part for arbitrary meromorphic functions. Next, in this paper we consider some differential-algebraic (d.a.) properties of functions \Gamma(z), \zeta(z), K(z), A(z). As it is well-known (H\" older; Ostrowski) \Gamma(z) is not a solution of any d.a. equation. It appears that this property of \Gamma(z) is universal. Namely, a large class of solutions of functional differential equations also has that property. Proof of these facts is reduced, by the use of the theory of differential algebraic fields (Ritt; Kaplansky; Kolchin), to the d.a. transcendency of \Gamma(z).
