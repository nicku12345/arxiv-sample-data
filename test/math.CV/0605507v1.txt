Let X be a complex curve, X_{sa} the subanalytic site associated to X, M a holonomic D_X-module. Let O^t be the sheaf on X_{sa} of tempered holomorphic functions, Sol(M) (resp. Sol^t(M)) the complex of holomorphic (resp. tempered holomorphic) solutions of M. We prove that the natural morphism from H^1 Sol^t(M) to H^1Sol(M) is an isomorphism of sheaves on X_{sa}. As a consequence, we prove that Sol^t(M) is R-constructible in the sense of sheaves on X_{sa}. Such a result is conjectured by M. Kashiwara and P. Schapira in Ast\'erisque 284 in any dimension.
