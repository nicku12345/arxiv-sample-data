In the early 1980's an elementary algorithm for computing conformal maps was discovered by R. K\"uhnau and the first author. The algorithm is fast and accurate, but convergence was not known. Given points z_0,...,z_n in the plane, the algorithm computes an explicit conformal map of the unit disk onto a region bounded by a Jordan curve \gamma with z_0,...,z_n \in \gamma. We prove convergence for Jordan regions in the sense of uniformly close boundaries, and give corresponding uniform estimates on the closed region and the closed disc for the mapping functions and their inverses. Improved estimates are obtained if the data points lie on a C^1 curve or a K-quasicircle. The algorithm was discovered as an approximate method for conformal welding, however it can also be viewed as a discretization of the L\"owner differential equation.
