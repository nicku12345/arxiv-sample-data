For a regular compact set K in C^m and a measure \mu on K satisfying the Bernstein-Markov inequality, we consider the ensemble P_N of polynomials of degree N, endowed with the Gaussian probability measure induced by L^2(\mu). We show that for large N, the simultaneous zeros of m polynomials in P_N tend to concentrate around the Silov boundary of K; more precisely, their expected distribution is asymptotic to N^m \mu_{eq}, where \mu_{eq} is the equilibrium measure of K. For the case where K is the unit ball, we give scaling asymptotics for the expected distribution of zeros as N\to\infty.
