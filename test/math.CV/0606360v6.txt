A multivariate polynomial is {\em stable} if it is nonvanishing whenever all variables have positive imaginary parts. We classify all linear partial differential operators in the Weyl algebra \A_n that preserve stability. An important tool that we develop in the process is the higher dimensional generalization of P\'olya-Schur's notion of multiplier sequence. We characterize all multivariate multiplier sequences as well as those of finite order. Next, we establish a multivariate extension of the Cauchy-Poincar\'e interlacing theorem and prove a natural analog of the Lax conjecture for real stable polynomials in two variables. Using the latter we describe all operators in \A_1 that preserve univariate hyperbolic polynomials by means of determinants and homogenized symbols. Our methods also yield homotopical properties for symbols of linear stability preservers and a duality theorem showing that an operator in \A_n preserves stability if and only if its Fischer-Fock adjoint does. These are powerful multivariate extensions of the classical Hermite-Poulain-Jensen theorem, P\'olya's curve theorem and Schur-Mal\'o-Szeg\H{o} composition theorems. Examples and applications to strict stability preservers are also discussed.
