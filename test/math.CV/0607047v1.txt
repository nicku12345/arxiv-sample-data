In this paper we characterize compactness of the canonical solution operator to d-bar on weigthed L^2 spaces on \mathbb C. For this purpose we consider certain Schr\"odinger operators with magnetic fields and use a condition which is equivalent to the property that these operators have compact resolvents. We also point out what are the obstructions in the case of several complex variables.
