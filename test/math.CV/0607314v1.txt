We study the regularity of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations (dd^c u)^n=f dV, on bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains  \Omega \subset \C^n. We show, under a mild technical assumption, that the unique solution u to such an equation is H\"older continuous if the boundary values \phi are H\"older continuous and the density f belongs to L^p(\Omega) for some p>1. This improves previous results by Bedford-Taylor and Kolodziej.
