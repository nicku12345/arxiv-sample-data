We extend the celebrated theorem of Kellogg for conformal diffeomorphisms to the minimizers of Dirichlet energy. Namely we prove that a diffeomorphic minimiser of Dirichlet energy of Sobolev mappings between doubly connected Riemanian surfaces (\X,\sigma) and (\Y,\rho) having \mathscr{C}^{n,\alpha} boundary, 0<\alpha<1, is \mathscr{C}^{n,\alpha} up to the boundary, provided the metric \rho is smooth enough. Here n is a positive integer. It is crucial that, every diffeomorphic minimizer of Dirichlet energy is a harmonic mapping with a very special Hopf differential and this fact is used in the proof. This improves and extends a recent result by the author and Lamel in \cite{kalam}, where the authors proved a similar result for double-connected domains in the complex plane but for \alpha' which is \le \alpha and \rho\equiv 1. This is a complementary result of an existence result proved by T. Iwaniec et al. in \cite{iwa} and the author in \cite{kal0}
