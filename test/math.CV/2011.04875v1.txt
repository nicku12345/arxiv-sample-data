We introduce a class of analytic functions subordinate to the function 1+\sinh \left( z\right)  and obtain various necessary and sufficient conditions for functions to be in the class. These conditions mainly comprise of the coefficient inequalities involving convolution. Further, we have obtained sharp five initial coefficients, a conjecture for the general nth coefficient and the third Hankel determinant bounds for the functions in this class. Also derived certain differential subordination implication results involving 1+\sinh \left( z\right).
