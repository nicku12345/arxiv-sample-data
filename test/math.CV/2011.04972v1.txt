Let (\phi_t)_{t \geq 0} be a semigroup of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disk \mathbb{D} with Denjoy-Wolff point \tau=1. The angular derivative is \phi_t^{\prime}(1)= e^{-\lambda t}, where \lambda \geq 0 is the spectral value of (\phi_t). If \lambda>0 the semigroup is hyperbolic, otherwise it is parabolic. Suppose K is a compact non-polar subset of \mathbb{D} with positive logarithmic capacity. We specify the type of the semigroup by examining the asymptotic behavior of \phi_t(K). We provide a representation of the spectral value of the semigroup with the use of several potential theoretic quantities e.g. harmonic measure, Green function, extremal length, condenser capacity.
