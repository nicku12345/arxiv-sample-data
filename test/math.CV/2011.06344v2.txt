Let f(x) be a non-zero polynomial with complex coefficients, and M_p = \int_{0}^1 f(x)^p dx for p a positive integer. In a recent paper, M\"uger and Tuset showed that \limsup_{p \to \infty} |M_p|^{1/p} > 0, and conjectured that this limit is equal to the maximum amongst the critical values of f together with the values |f(0)| and |f(1)|. We give an example that shows that this conjecture is false. It also may be natural to guess that \limsup_{p \to \infty} |M_p|^{1/p} is equal to the maximum of |f(x)| on [0,1]. However, we give a counterexample to this as well. We also provide a few more guesses as to the behaviour of the quantity \limsup_{p \to \infty} |M_p|^{1/p}.
