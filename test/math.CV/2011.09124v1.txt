Let (X, T^{1,0}X) be a compact connected orientable CR manifold of dimension 2n+1 with non-degenerate Levi curvature. Assume that X admits a connected compact Lie group G action. Under certain natural assumptions about the group G action, we define G-equivariant Szeg\H{o} kernels and establish the associated Boutet de Monvel-Sj\"ostrand type theorems. When X admits also a transversal CR S^1 action, we study the asymptotics of Fourier components of G-equivariant Szeg\H{o} kernels with respect to the S^1 action.
