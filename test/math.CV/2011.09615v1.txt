Any open Riemann surface R_0 of finite genus g can be conformally embedded into a closed Riemann surface of the same genus, that is, R_0 is realized as a subdomain of a closed Riemann surface of genus g. We are concerned with the set M(R_0) of such closed Riemann surfaces. We formulate the problem in the Teichm\"{u}ller space setting to investigate geometric properties of M(R_{0}). We show, among other things, that M(R_{0}) is a closed Lipschitz domain homeomorphic to a closed ball provided that R_0 is nonanalytically finite.
