A sharp version of a recent inequality of Kovalev and Yang on the ratio of the (H^1)^\ast and H^4 norms for certain polynomials is obtained. The inequality is applied to establish a sharp and tractable sufficient condition for the Wirtinger derivatives at the origin for harmonic self-maps of the unit disc which fix the origin.
