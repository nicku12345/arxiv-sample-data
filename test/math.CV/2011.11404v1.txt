Let h be a non vanishing convex univalent function and p be an analytic function in \mathbb{D}. We consider the differential subordination \psi_i(p(z), z p'(z)) \prec h(z) with the admissible functions in consideration as \psi_1:=(\beta p(z)+\gamma)^{-\alpha}\left(\tfrac{(\beta p(z)+\gamma)}{\beta(1-\alpha)}+ z p'(z)\right) and \psi_2:=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma \beta}}\arctan\left(\sqrt{\tfrac{\beta}{\gamma}}p^{1-\alpha}(z)\right)+\left(\tfrac{1-\alpha}{\beta p^{2 (1-\alpha)}(z)+\gamma}\right)\tfrac{z p'(z)}{p^{\alpha}(z)}. The objective of this paper is to find the dominants, preferably the best dominant(say q) of the solution of the above differential subordination satisfying \psi_i(q, n zq'(z))= h(z). Further, we show that \psi_i(q,zq'(z))= h(z) is an exact differential equation and q is a convex univalent function in \mathbb{D}. In addition, we estimate the sharp lower bound of \RE p for different choices of h and derive a univalence criteria for functions in \mathcal{H}(class of analytic normalized functions) as an application to our results.
