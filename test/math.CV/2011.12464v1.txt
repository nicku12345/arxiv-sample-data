Let D be a bounded domain in \mathbb{C}^n, n\ge 1. In this paper, we study two biholomorphic invariants on D, the Fridman invariant e_D(z) and the squeezing function s_D(z). More specifically, we study the following two questions about the \textit{quotient invariant} m_D(z)=s_D(z)/e_D(z): 1) If m_D(z_0)=1 for some z_0\in D, is D biholomorphic to the unit ball? 2) Is m_D(z) constantly equal to 1? We answer both questions negatively.
