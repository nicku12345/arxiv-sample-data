Below we establish the conditions guaranteeing the reality of all the zeros of polynomials P_n(z) in the polynomial sequence \{P_n(z)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} satisfying a five-term recurrence relation   P_{n}(z)= zP_{n-1}(z) + \alpha P_{n-2}(z)+\beta P_{n-3}(z)+\gamma P_{n-4}(z), with the standard initial conditions P_0(z) = 1, P_{-1}(z) = P_{-2}(z) =P_{-3}(z) = 0, where \alpha, \beta, \gamma are real coefficients, \gamma\neq 0 and z is a complex variable. We interprete this sequence of polynomials as principal minors of an appropriate banded Teoplitz matrix whose associated Laurent polynomial b(z) is holomorphic in \mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}. We show that when either the critical points of b(z) are all real; or when they are two real and one pair of complex conjugate critical points with some extra conditions on the parameters, the set b^{-1}(\mathbb{R}) contains a Jordan curve with 0 in its interior and in some cases a non-simple curve enclosing 0. The presence of the said curves is necessary and sufficient for every polynomial in the sequence \{P_n(z)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} to be hyperbolic (real-rooted).
