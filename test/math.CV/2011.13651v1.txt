We study membership of rational inner functions in Dirichlet-type spaces in polydisks. In particular, we prove a theorem relating such inclusions to H^p integrability of partial derivatives of a RIF, and as a corollary we prove that all rational inner functions on \mathbb{D}^n belong to \mathcal{D}_{1/n, \ldots ,1/n}(\mathbb{D}^n). Furthermore, we show that if 1/p \in \mathcal{D}_{\alpha,...,\alpha}, then the RIF \tilde{p}/p \in \mathcal{D}_{\alpha+2/n,...,\alpha+2/n}. Finally we illustrate how these results can be applied through several examples, and how the Lojasiewicz inequality can sometimes be applied to determine inclusion of 1/p in certain Dirichlet-type spaces.
