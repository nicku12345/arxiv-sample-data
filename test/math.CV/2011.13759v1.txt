In this article, we investigate an axiomatic approach introduced by Grivaux for the study of rational Bott-Chern cohomology, and use it in that context to define Chern classes of coherent sheaves. This method also allows us to derive a Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck formula for a projective morphism between smooth complex compact manifolds. In the general case of complex spaces, the Poincar\'e and Dolbeault-Grothendieck lemmas are not always valid. For this reason, and to simplify the exposition, we only consider non singular complex spaces. The appendix presents a calculation of integral Bott-Chern cohomology in top degree for a connected compact manifold.
