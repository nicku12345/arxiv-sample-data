The aim of this paper is to extend the so called slice analysis to a general case in which the codomain is a real vector space of even dimension, i.e. is of the form \mathbb{R}^{2n}. We define a cone \mathcal{W}_\mathcal{C}^d in [End(\mathbb{R}^{2n})]^d and we extend the slice-topology \tau_s to this cone. Slice regular functions can be defined on open sets in \left(\tau_s,\mathcal{W}_\mathcal{C}^d\right) and a number of results can be proved in this framework, among which a representation formula. This theory can be applied to some real algebras, called left slice complex structure algebras. These algebras include quaternions, octonions, Clifford algebras and real alternative *-algebras but also left-alternative algebras and sedenions, thus providing brand new settings in slice analysis.
