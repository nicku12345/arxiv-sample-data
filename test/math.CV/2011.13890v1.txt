In this paper, we investigate the Bohr phenomenon for the class of analytic functions defined on the simply connected domain   \begin{equation*}   \Omega_{\gamma}=\bigg\{z\in\mathbb{C} : \bigg|z+\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\bigg|<\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\bigg\}\;\; \text{for}\;\; 0\leq \gamma<1.   \end{equation*} We study improved Bohr radius, Bohr-Rogosinski radius and refined Bohr radius for the class of analytic functions defined in  \Omega_{\gamma} , and obtain several sharp results.
