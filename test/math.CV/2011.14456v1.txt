We present an analytical proof that certain natural metric planar universal covers are Hadamard metric spaces. In particular if \rho=\varphi\circ u where u is locally Lipschitz and subharmonic in \Omega, \varphi is positive and increasing on an interval containing u(\Omega) with \log\varphi convex, and if the metric space (\Omega,\rho(z)|dz|) is complete, then it has universal cover (\tilde{\Omega},\tilde{d}) which is a Hadamard space for which geodesics have Lipschitz continuous first derivatives.
