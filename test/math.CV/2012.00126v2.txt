We provide a complete characterization of bicomplex polyharmonic functions that are the hyperbolic real part of a specific kind of bicomplex polyholomorphic functions. This is a bicomplex analog of the well-known result asserting that harmonic functions, on simply connected domains, are the real part of holomorphic ones.
