We say that a CR singular submanifold M has a removable CR singularity if the CR structure at the CR points of M extends through the singularity as an abstract CR structure on M. We study such real-analytic submanifolds, in which case removability is equivalent to M being the image of a generic real-analytic submanifold N under a holomorphic map that is a diffeomorphism of N onto M, what we call a CR image. We study the stability of the CR singularity under perturbation, the associated quadratic invariants, and conditions for removability of a CR singularity. A lemma is also proved about perturbing away the zeros of holomorphic functions on CR submanifolds, which could be of independent interest.
