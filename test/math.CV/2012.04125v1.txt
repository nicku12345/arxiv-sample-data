\emph{Sendov's conjecture} asserts that if a complex polynomial f of degree n \geq 2 has all of its zeroes in closed unit disk \{ z: |z| \leq 1 \}, then for each such zero \lambda_0 there is a zero of the derivative f' in the closed unit disk \{ z: |z-\lambda_0| \leq 1 \}. This conjecture is known for n < 9, but only partial results are available for higher n. We show that there exists a constant n_0 such that Sendov's conjecture holds for n \geq n_0. For \lambda_0 away from the origin and the unit circle we can appeal to the prior work of D\'egot and Chalebgwa; for \lambda_0 near the unit circle we refine a previous argument of Miller (and also invoke results of Chijiwa when \lambda_0 is extremely close to the unit circle); and for \lambda_0 near the origin we introduce a new argument using compactness methods, balayage, and the argument principle.
