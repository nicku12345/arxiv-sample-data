In this paper we prove a Rad\'o type result showing that there is no univalent polyharmonic mapping of the unit disk onto the whole complex plane. We also establish a connection between the boundary functions of harmonic and biharmonic mappings. Finally, we show how a close-to-convex biharmonic mapping can be constructed from a convex harmonic mapping.
