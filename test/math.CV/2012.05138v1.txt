In 1993, Shub and Smale posed the problem of finding a sequence of univariate polynomials of degree N with condition number bounded above by N. In a previous paper by C. Belt\'an, U. Etayo, J. Marzo and J. Ortega-Cerd\`a, it was proved that the optimal value of the condition number is of the form O(\sqrt{N}), and the sequence demanded by Shub and Smale was described by a closed formula (for large enough N\geqslant N_0 with N_0 unknown) and by a search algorithm for the rest of the cases. In this paper we find concrete estimates for the constant hidden in the O(\sqrt{N}) term and we describe a simple formula for a sequence of polynomials whose condition number is at most N, valid for all N=4M^2, with M a positive integer.
