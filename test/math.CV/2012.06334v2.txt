The maximum of the modulus of a meromorphic function cannot be restricted from above by the Nevanlinna characteristic of this meromorphic function. But integrals from the logarithm of the module of a meromorphic function allow similar restrictions from above. This is illustrated by one of the important theorems of Rolf Nevanlinna in the classical monograph by A.A. Goldberg and I.V. Ostrovskii on meromorphic functions, as well as by the Edrei-Fuchs Lemma on small arcs and its versions for small intervals in articles by A.F. Grishin, M.L. Sodin, T.I. Malyutina. Similar results for integrals of differences of subharmonic functions even with weights were recently obtained by B.N. Khabiblullin, L.A. Gabdrakhmanova. All these results are on integrals over subsets on a ray. In this article, we establish such results for integrals of the logarithm of the modulus of a meromorphic function and the difference of subharmonic functions over discs and planar small sets. Our estimates are uniform in the sense that the constants in these estimates are explicitly written out and do not depend on meromorphic functions and the difference of subharmonic functions provided that these functions has an integral normalization near zero.
