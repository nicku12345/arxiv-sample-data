In this paper we establish the coefficient bodies for a wide class of families of inverse functions. We also completely describe those functions that provide boundary points of that bodies in small dimensions. As an application we get sharp bounds for Fekete--Szeg\"{o} functionals over some classes of functions defined by quasi-subordination as well as over classes of their inverses. As a biproduct we derive a formula for ordinary Bell polynomials that seems to be new.
