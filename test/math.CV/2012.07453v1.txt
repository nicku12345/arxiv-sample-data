Let f_\omega(z)=\sum\limits_{j=0}^{\infty}\chi_j(\omega) a_j z^j be a random entire function, where \chi_j(\omega) are independent and identically distributed random variables defined on a probability space (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu). In this paper, we first define a family of random entire functions, which includes Gaussian, Rademacher, Steinhaus entire functions. Then, we prove that, for almost all functions in the family and for any constant C>1, there exist a constant r_0=r_0(\omega) and a set E\subset [e, \infty) of finite logarithmic measure such that, for r>r_0 and r\notin E,  |\log M(r, f)- N(r,0, f_\omega)|\le (C/A)^{\frac1{B}}\log^{\frac1{B}}\log M(r,f) +\log\log M(r, f), \qquad a.s.  where A, B are constants, M(r, f) is the maximum modulus, and N(r, 0, f) is the weighted counting-zero function of f. As a by-product of our main results, we prove Nevanlinna's second main theorem for random entire functions. Thus, the characteristic function of almost all functions in the family is bounded above by a weighed counting function, rather than by two weighted counting functions in the classical Nevanlinna theory. For instance, we show that, for almost all Gaussian entire functions f_\omega and for any \epsilon>0, there is r_0 such that, for r>r_0,  T(r, f) \le N(r,0, f_\omega)+(\frac12+\epsilon) \log T(r, f).
