In this paper, we prove a general second main theorem for meromorphic mappings into a subvariety V of \mathbb P^N(\mathbb C) with an arbitrary family of moving hypersurfaces. Our second main theorem generalizes and improves all previous results for meromorphic mappings with moving hypersurfaces, in particular for meromorphic mappings and families of moving hypersurfaces in subgeneral position. The method of our proof is different from that of previous authors used for the case of moving hypersurfaces.
