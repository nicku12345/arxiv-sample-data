In a previous work, we introduced the Collatz polynomials; these are the polynomials \left[P_N(z)\right]_{N\in\mathbb{N}} such that \left[z^0\right]P_N = N and \left[z^{k+1}\right]P_N = c\left(\left[z^k\right]P_N\right), where c:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N} is the Collatz function 1\rightarrow 0, 2n\rightarrow n, 2n+1\rightarrow 3n+2 (for example, P_5(z) = 5 + 8z + 4z^2 + 2z^3 + z^4). In this article, we prove that all zeros of P_N (which we call Collatz zeros) lie in an annulus centered at the origin, with outer radius 2 and inner radius a function of the largest odd iterate of N. Moreover, using an extension of the Enestr\"om-Kakeya Theorem, we prove that |z| = 2 for a root of P_N if and only if the Collatz trajectory of N has a certain form; as a corollary, the set of N for which our upper bound is an equality is sparse in \mathbb{N}. Inspired by these results, we close with some questions for further study.
