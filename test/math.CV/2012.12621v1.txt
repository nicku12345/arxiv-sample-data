Some sufficient conditions on certain constants which are involved in some first, second and third order differential subordinations associated with certain functions with positive real part like modified Sigmoid function, exponential function and Janowski function are obtained so that the analytic function p normalized by the condition p(0) = 1, is subordinate to Janowski function. The admissibility conditions for Janowski function are used as a tool in the proof of the results. As application, several sufficient conditions are also computed for Janowski starlikeness.
