By considering the polynomial function \phi_{car}(z)=1+z+z^2/2, we define the class \Scar consisting of normalized analytic functions f such that zf'/f is subordinate to \phi_{car} in the unit disk. The inclusion relations and various radii constants associated with the class \Scar and its connection with several well-known subclasses of starlike functions is established. As an application, the obtained results are applied to derive the properties of the partial sums and convolution.
