In this paper we study the following "slice rigidity property": given two Kobayashi complete hyperbolic manifolds M, N and a collection of complex geodesics \mathcal F of M, when is it true that every holomorphic map F:M\to N which maps isometrically every complex geodesic of \mathcal F onto a complex geodesic of N is a biholomorphism? Among other things, we prove that this is the case if M, N are smooth bounded strictly (linearly) convex domains, every element of \mathcal F contains a given point of \overline{M} and \mathcal F spans all of M. More general results are provided in dimension 2 and for the unit ball.
