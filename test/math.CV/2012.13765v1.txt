In this paper, we study the uniqueness of the differential-difference of meromorphic functions. We prove the following result: Let f be a nonconstant meromorphic function of \rho_{2}(f)<1, let \eta be a non-zero complex number, n\geq1, k\geq0 two integers and let a\not\equiv0,\infty be a small function of f. If f and (\Delta_{\eta}^{n}f)^{(k)} share 0,\infty CM and share a IM, then f\equiv(\Delta_{\eta}^{n}f)^{(k)}, which use a completely different method to improve some results due to Chen-Xu [1].
