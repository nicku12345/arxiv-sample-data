In this paper, we study the uniqueness of meromporphic functions and their difference operators. In particular, We have proved: Let f be a nonconstant entire function on \mathbb{C}^{n}, let \eta\in \mathbb{C}^{n} be a nonzero complex number, and let a and b be two distinct complex numbers in \mathbb{C}^{n}. If \varlimsup_{r\rightarrow\infty}\frac{logT(r,f)}{r}=0, and if f(z) and (\Delta_{\eta}^{n}f(z))^{(k)} share a CM and share b IM, then f(z)\equiv(\Delta_{\eta}^{n}f(z))^{(k)}.
