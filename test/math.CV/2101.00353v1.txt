We introduce and study the following special type of differential subordination implication: \begin{equation}\label{abs} p(z)Q(z)+\frac{zp'(z)}{\beta p(z)+\alpha}\prec h(z)\quad\Rightarrow p(z)\prec h(z), \end{equation} which involves generalization of the Briot-Bouquet differential subordination, where Q(z) is analytic and 0\neq\beta,\alpha\in\mathbb{C}. Further, some special cases of our result are also discussed. Finally, analogues of open door lemma and integral existence theorem with applications to univalent functions are obtained.
