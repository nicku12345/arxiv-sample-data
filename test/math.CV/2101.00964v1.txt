In this paper, we give a simple proof and strengthening of a uniqueness theorem of meromorphic functions which partially share 0, \infty CM and 1 IM with their difference operators. Meanwhile, we partial solve a conjecture given by Chen-Yi in \cite{CY} and generalize some previous theorems in \cite{C, CX}.
