In [7], Dong and I proved that the domains D \subset \mathbb{C} of finite volume whose on-diagonal Bergman kernels K(\cdot, \cdot) satisfy K(z_0, z_0) = Volume(D)^{-1} are disks minus closed polar sets. We utilized the solution of the Suita conjecture, a deep theorem of several complex variables. In this note, I present a significantly more elementary proof of this theorem that does not use several complex variables. As a corollary, a new lower bound for the on-diagonal Bergman kernel is given. Finally, I show that the only real ellipsoid in Webster normal form which satisfies K(0, 0) = Volume(D)^{-1} is the unit ball.
