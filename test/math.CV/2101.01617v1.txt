Let h be a non-vanishing analytic function in the open unit disc with h(0)=1. Consider the class consisting of normalized analytic functions f whose ratios f(z)/g(z), g(z)/z p(z), and p(z) are each subordinate to h for some analytic functions g and p. The radius of starlikeness is obtained for this class when h is chosen to be either h(z)=\sqrt{1+z} or h(z)=e^z. Further \mathcal{G}-radius is also obtained for each of these two classes when \mathcal{G} is a particular widely studied subclass of starlike functions. These include \mathcal{G} consisting of the Janowski starlike functions, and functions which are parabolic starlike.
