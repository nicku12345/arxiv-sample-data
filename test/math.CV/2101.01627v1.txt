A starlike univalent function f is characterized by the function zf'(z)/f(z); several subclasses of these functions were studied in the past by restricting the function zf'(z)/f(z) to take values in a region \Omega on the right-half plane, or, equivalently, by requiring the function zf'(z)/f(z) to be subordinate to the corresponding mapping of the unit disk \mathbb{D} to the region \Omega.   The mappings w_1(z):=z+\sqrt{1+z^2}, w_2(z):=\sqrt{1+z} and w_3(z):=e^z maps the unit disk \mathbb{D} to various regions in the right half plane. For normalized analytic functions f satisfying the conditions that f(z)/g(z), g(z)/zp(z) and p(z) are subordinate to the functions w_i, i=1,2,3 in various ways for some analytic functions g(z) and p(z), we determine the sharp radius for them to belong to various subclasses of starlike functions.
