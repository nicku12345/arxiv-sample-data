The author makes use of infinite compositions and a limiting function to construct a \mathcal{C}^\infty tetration function \mathcal{F}(t) = e \tet t. As a tetration function, \mathcal{F} satisfies e^{\mathcal{F}(t)} = \mathcal{F}(t+1). Of it, \mathcal{F} takes (-2,\infty) \to \mathbb{R} bijectively with strictly monotone growth, and is continuously differentiable here. We then iterate this construction to derive arbitrary hyper-operations e\up^k t. These hyper-operations are \mathcal{C}^\infty strictly monotone bijections of (\alpha_k,\infty) \to \mathbb{R} for k even (1-k > \alpha_k \ge -k), and \mathcal{C}^\infty strictly monotone bijections of \mathbb{R} \to (\alpha_k, \infty) for k odd. These hyper-operations satisfy the functional equation e \up^{k-1} (e \up^k t) = e \up^k (t+1) with the initial conditions e \up^1 t = e^t and e \up^k 0 = 1.
