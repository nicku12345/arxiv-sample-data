The squeezing problem on \mathbb{C} can be stated as follows. Suppose that \Omega is a multiply connected domain in the unit disk \mathbb{D} containing the origin z=0. How far can the boundary of \Omega be pushed from the origin by an injective holomorphic function f:\Omega\to \mathbb{D} keeping the origin fixed?   In this note, we discuss recent results on this problem obtained by Ng, Tang and Tsai (Math. Anal. 2020) and by Gumenyuk and Roth (arXiv:2011.13734, 2020) and also prove few new results using a method suggested in one of our previous papers (Zapiski Nauchn. Sem. POMI 1993).
