Let D be a bounded convex domain in \mathbb C^n. A pair of distinct boundary points \{p,q\} of D has the visibility property provided there exist a compact subset K_{p,q}\subset D and open neighborhoods U_p of p and U_q of q, such that the real geodesics for the Kobayashi metric of D which join points in U_p and U_q intersect K_{p,q}. Every Gromov hyperbolic convex domain enjoys the visibility property for any couple of boundary points. The Goldilocks domains introduced by Bharali and Zimmer and the log-type domains of Liu and Wang also enjoy the visibility property.   In this paper we prove that a certain estimate on the growth of the Kobayashi distance near the boundary points is a necessary condition for visibility and provide new cases where this estimate and the visibility property hold.   We also exploit visibility for studying the boundary behavior of biholomorphic maps.
