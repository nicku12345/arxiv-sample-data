The conditions on A, B, \beta and \gamma are obtained for an analytic function p defined on the open unit disc \mathbb{D} and normalized by p(0)=1 to be subordinate to (1+Az)/(1+Bz), -1\leq B<A \leq 1 when p(z)+ zp'(z)/(\beta p(z)+\gamma) is subordinate to e^{z}. The conditions on these parameters are derived for the function p to be subordinate to \sqrt{1+z} or e^{z} when p(z)+ zp'(z)/(\beta p(z)+\gamma) is subordinate to (1+Az)/(1+Bz). The conditions on \beta and \gamma are determined for the function p to be subordinate to e^{z} when p(z)+ zp'(z)/(\beta p(z)+\gamma) is subordinate to \sqrt{1+z}. Related result for the function p(z)+ zp'(z)/(\beta p(z)+\gamma) to be in the parabolic region bounded by the \operatorname{Re} w=|w-1| is investigated. Sufficient conditions for the Bernardi's integral operator to belong to the various subclasses of starlike functions are obtained as applications
