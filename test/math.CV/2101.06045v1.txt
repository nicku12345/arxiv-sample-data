Sufficient conditions are determined on the parameters such that the generalized and normalized Bessel function of the first kind and other related functions belong to subclasses of starlike and convex functions defined in the unit disk associated with the exponential mapping. Several differential subordination implications are derived for analytic functions involving Bessel function and the operator introduced by Baricz \emph{et al.} [Differential subordinations involving generalized Bessel functions, Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc. {\bf 38} (2015), no.~3, 1255--1280]. These results are obtained by constructing suitable class of admissible functions. Examples involving trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are provided to illustrate the obtained results.
