We prove versions of Rad\'o's theorem for polyanalytic functions in one variable and also on simply connected \mathbb{C}-convex domains in \mathbb{C}^n. Let \Omega\subset \mathbb{C} be a bounded, simply connected domain and let q\in \mathbb{Z}_+. Suppose at least one of the following conditions holds true: (i) g\in C^{q}(\Omega). (ii) g\in C^\kappa(\Omega), for \kappa=\min\{1,q-1\}, such that g is q-analytic on \Omega\setminus g^{-1}(0) and such that Reg (Img respectively) is a solutions to the p'-Laplace equation (p''-Laplace equation respectively) on \Omega\setminus g^{-1}(0), for some p',p''>1. Then g agrees (Lebesgue) a.e.\ with a function that is q-analytic on \Omega. In the process we give a simple proof of the fact that: If f\in C^q(\Omega) is q-analytic on \Omega\setminus f^{-1}(0) then f is q-analytic on \Omega. The extensions of the results to several complex variables are straightforward using known techniques.
