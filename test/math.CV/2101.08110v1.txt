We show that a global holomorphic section of \mathscr{O}(d) restricted to a closed complex subspace X \subset \mathbb{P}^n has an interpolant if and only if it satisfies a set of moment conditions that involves a residue current associated with a locally free resolution of \mathscr{O}_X. When X is a finite set of points in \mathbb{C}^n \subset \mathbb{P}^n this can be interpreted as a set of linear conditions that a function on X has to satisfy in order to have a polynomial interpolant of degree at most d.
