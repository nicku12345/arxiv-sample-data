Let \varphi be a quasi-psh function on a complex manifold X and let S\subset X be a complex submanifold. Then the multiplier ideal sheaves \mathcal{I}(\varphi|_S)\subset\mathcal{I}(\varphi)|_{S} and the complex singularity exponents c_{x}\left(\varphi|_{S}\right)\leqslant c_{x}(\varphi) by Ohsawa-Takegoshi L^{2} extension theorem. An interesting question is to know whether it is possible to get equalities in the above formulas. In the present article, we show that the answer is positive when S is chosen outside a measure zero set in a suitable projective space.
