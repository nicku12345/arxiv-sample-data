This article is devoted to the study of mappings with branch points whose characteristics satisfy integral-type constraints. We have proved theorems concerning their local and global behavior. In particular, we established the equicontinuity of families of such mappings inside their definition domain, as well as, under additional conditions, equicontinuity of the families of these mappings in its closure.
