In this article we continue the research, carried out in \cite{zajac}, on computing the *-product of domains in \CC^N. Assuming that 0\in G\subset\CC^N is an arbitrary Runge domain and 0\in D\subset\CC^N is a bounded, smooth and linearly convex domain (or a non-decreasing union of such ones), we establish a geometric relation between D*G and another domain in \CC^N which is 'extremal' (in an appropriate sense) with respect to a special coefficient multiplier dependent only on the dimension N. Next, for N=2, we derive a characterization of the latter domain expressed in terms of planar geometry. These two results, when combined together, give a formula which allows to calculate D*G for two-dimensional domains D and G satisfying the outlined assumptions.
