Complex linear differential equations with entire coefficients are studied in the situation where one of the coefficients is an exponential polynomial and dominates the growth of all the other coefficients. If such an equation has an exponential polynomial solution f, then the order of f and of the dominant coefficient are equal, and the two functions possess a certain duality property. The results presented in this paper improve earlier results by some of the present authors, and the paper adjoins with two open problems.
