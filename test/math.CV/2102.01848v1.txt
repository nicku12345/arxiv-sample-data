For a function f that is piecewise analytic on a quasi-smooth arc \mathcal{L} and any 0<\sigma<1 we construct a sequence of "near-best" polynomials that converge at a rate e^{-n^{\sigma}} at each point of analyticity of f and are close to the best polynomial approximants on the whole \mathcal{L}. Also we give examples of quasi-smooth arcs for which convergence of "near-best" approximants at points of analiticity of f is geometric, i.e. has a rate e^{-cn} with some c>0.
