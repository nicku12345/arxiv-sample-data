Hosono obtained sharper estimates of the Ohsawa--Takegoshi L^2-extention theorem by allowing the constant depending on the weight function for a domain in \mathbb{C}. In this article, we show the higher dimensional case of sharper estimates of the Ohsawa--Takegoshi L^2-extention theorem. To prove the higher dimensional case of them, we establish an analogue of Berndtsson--Lempert type L^2-extension theorem by using the pluricomplex Green functions with poles along subvarieties. As a special case, we consider the sharper estimates in terms of the Azukawa pseudometric and show that the higher dimensional case of sharper estimate provides the L^2-minimum extension for radial case.
