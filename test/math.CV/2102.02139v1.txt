The Geometric Shafarevich Conjecture and the Theorem of de Franchis state the finiteness of the number of certain holomorphic objects on closed or punctured Riemann surfaces. The analog for Riemann surfaces of second kind is an estimate of the number of irreducible holomorphic objects up to homotopy (or isotopy, respectively). This analog addresses the problem of the validity of Gromov's Oka principle.   For any finite open Riemann surface X (maybe, of second kind) we give an effective upper bound for the number of irreducible holomorphic mappings up to homomotopy from X to the twice punctured complex plane, and an effective upper bound for the number of irreducible holomorphic torus bundles up to isotopy on such Riemann surface.   If X_{\sigma} is the \sigma-neighbourhood of a skeleton of a torus with a hole, then the number of irreducible holomorphic mappings up to homomotopy from X_{\sigma} to the twice punctured complex plane grows exponentially in \frac{1}{\sigma}. This can be interpreted as a quantitative statement of Gromov's Oka principle.
