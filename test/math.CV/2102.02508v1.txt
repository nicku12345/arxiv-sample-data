In this paper, we study the transcendental entire solutions for the nonlinear differential-difference equations of the forms: f^{2}(z)+\widetilde{\omega} f(z)f'(z)+q(z)e^{Q(z)}f(z+c)=u(z)e^{v(z)}, and f^{n}(z)+\omega f^{n-1}(z)f'(z)+q(z)e^{Q(z)}f(z+c)=p_{1}e^{\lambda_{1} z}+p_{2}e^{\lambda_{2} z}, \quad n\geq 3, where \omega is a constant, \widetilde{\omega}, c, \lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, p_{1}, p_{2} are non-zero constants, q, Q, u, v are polynomials such that Q,v are not constants and q,u\not\equiv0. Our results are improvements and complements of some previous results.
