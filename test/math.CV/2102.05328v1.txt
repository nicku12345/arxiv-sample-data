A complex manifold X is \emph{weakly complete} if it admits a continuous plurisubharmonic exhaustion function \phi. The minimal kernels \Sigma_X^k, k \in [0,\infty] (the loci where are all \mathcal{C}^k plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions fail to be strictly plurisubharmonic),introduced by Slodkowski-Tomassini, and the Levi currents, introduced by Sibony, are both concepts aimed at measuring how far X is from being Stein. We compare these notions, prove that all Levi currents are supported by all the \Sigma_X^k's, and give sufficient conditions for points in \Sigma_X^k to be in the support of some Levi current. When X is a surface and \phi can be chosen analytic, building on previous work by the second author, Slodkowski, and Tomassini,we prove the existence of a Levi current precisely supported on \Sigma_X^\infty, and give a classification of Levi currents on X. In particular,unless X is a modification of a Stein space, every point in X is in the support of some Levi current.
