A generalization of the homological Poincare's operator was used to estimate the dimension of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal holomorphic automorphisms of an arbitrary germ of a real analytic hypersurface in {\bf C}^4. The following alternative is proved: either this dimension is infinite, or it does not exceed 24. Value 24 takes place only for one of two nondegenerate hyperquadrics. If the hypersurface is 2-nondegenerate at a generic point, then the dimension does not exceed 17, and if the hypersurface is 3-nondegenerate at a generic point, then the estimate is 20.
