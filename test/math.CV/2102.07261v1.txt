We study mappings that satisfy the inverse Poletskii-type inequality in a domain of Euclidean space. It was proved that such mappings have a continuous extension to the boundary under some conditions on the geometry of the given and the mapped domains if the majorant responsible for the distortion of the families of paths has finite integrals over the set of spheres of positive linear measure.
