In this paper, we first generalize a result of Bishop and Steger [Representation theoretic rigidity in PSL(2, R). Acta Math., 170, (1993), 121-149] by proving that for a Fuchsian group G of divergence type and non-lattice, if h is a quasi-symmetric homeomorphism of the real axis \mathbb{R} corresponding to a quasi-conformal compact deformation of G. Then for any E\subset \mathbb{R}, we have max(dimE, dimh(\mathbb{R}\setminus E))=1. Furthermore, we showed that Bishop and steger's result does not hold for the covering groups of all 'd-dimensional jungle gym' (d is any positive integer) which generalizes G\"onye's results [ Differentiability of quasi-conformal maps on the jungle gym. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. Vol 359 (2007), 9-32] where the author discussed the case of '1-dimensional jungle gym'.
