It is known for some time that there exists an energy-minimal diffeomorphism between two doubly-connected domains \Omega and D provided that \mathrm{Mod}(\Omega)\le \mathrm{Mod}{D} and that diffeomorphism is harmonic \cite{tedi}. In this note we give a short proof of the fact that for given annuli \Omega and D satisfying the condition \mathrm{Mod}(\Omega)\le \mathrm{Mod}(D) there exist a K-quasiconformal harmonic diffeomorphism f:\Omega\onto D, where K=K(\tau), \tau=\mathrm{Mod}(\Omega)/ \mathrm{Mod}(D) and \lim_{\tau\to 1}K(\tau)=1.
