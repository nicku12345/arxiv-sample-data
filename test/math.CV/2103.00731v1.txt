The purpose of the paper is to rectify a series of errors occurred in [2], [17], [20] for a particular situation. To get a fruitful solution and to overcome the issue, we introduce a new form of set sharing namely restricted set sharing, which is stronger than the usual one. We manipulate the newly introduced notion in this specific section of literature to resolve all the complications. Not only that we have subtly used the same sharing form to a well known unique range set [3] to settle a long time unsolved problem.
