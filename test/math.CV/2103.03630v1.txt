In this paper, we investigate the value distribution for linear q-difference polynomials of transcendental meromorphic functions of zero order which improves the results of Xu, Liu and Cao (\cite{Xu & Liu & Cao & 2015}). We also investigate the uniqueness of zero order meromorphic function with its q-difference operator sharing two sets with finite weight. Some examples have been exhibited which are relevant to the content of the paper.
