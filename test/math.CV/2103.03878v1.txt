In this paper, we investigate the zero distributions of q-shift difference-differential polynomials of meromorphic functions with zero-order that extends and generalizes the classical Hayman results of the zeros of differential polynomials to q-shift difference. We also investigate the uniqueness problem of q-shift difference-differential polynomials sharing a polynomial value with finite weight.
