In this paper, we study the uniqueness of the differential polynomials of entire functions. We prove the following result: Let f(z) be a nonconstant entire function on \mathbb{C}^{n} and g(z)=b_{-1}+\sum_{i=0}^{n}b_{i}f^{(k_{i})}(z), where b_{-1} and b_{i} (i=0\ldots,n) are small meromorphic functions of f, k_{i}\geq0 (i=0\ldots,n) are integers. Let a_{1}(z)\not\equiv\infty, a_{2}(z)\not\equiv\infty be two distinct small meromorphic functions of f(z). If f(z) and g(z) share a_{1}(z) CM, and a_{2}(z) IM. Then either f(z)\equiv g(z) or a_{1}=2a_{2}, f(z)\equiv a_{2}(e^{2p(z)}-2e^{p(z)}+2), and g(z)\equiv a_{2}e^{p(z)}, where p(z) is a nonzero entire function satisfying a_{2}(z)p'(z)=1.
