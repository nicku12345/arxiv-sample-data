We construct new coordinates for the Teichm\"uller space Teich of a punctured torus into \bold{R} \times\bold{R}^+. The coordinates depend on the representation of Teich as a space of marked Kleinian groups G_\mu that depend holomorphically on a parameter \mu varying in a simply connected domain in \bold{C}. They describe the geometry of the hyperbolic manifold \bold{H}^3/G_\mu; they reflect exactly the visual patterns one sees in the limit sets of the groups G_\mu; and they are directly computable from the generators of G_\mu.
