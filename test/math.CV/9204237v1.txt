In previous work it had been shown that the remarkable homogeneous space M= \operatorname{Diff}(S^1)/\operatorname{PSL} (2,\Bbb{R}) sits as a complex analytic and K\"ahler submanifold of the Universal Teichm\"uller Space. There is a natural immersion \Pi of M into the infinite-dimensional version (due to Segal) of the Siegel space of period matrices. That map \Pi is proved to be injective, equivariant, holomorphic, and K\"ahler-isometric (with respect to the canonical metrics). Regarding a period mapping as a map describing the variation of complex structure, we explain why \Pi is an infinite-dimensional period mapping.
