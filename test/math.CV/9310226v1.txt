This paper attempts to describe some of the results obtained in the iteration theory of transcendental meromorphic functions, not excluding the case of entire functions. The reader is not expected to be familiar with the iteration theory of rational functions. On the other hand, some aspects where the transcendental case is analogous to the rational case are treated rather briefly here. For example, we introduce the different types of components of the Fatou set that occur in the iteration of rational functions but omit a detailed description of these types. Instead, we concentrate on the types of components that are special to transcendental functions (Baker domains and wandering domains).
