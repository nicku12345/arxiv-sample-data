Let F\in W^{1,n}_{\text{loc}}(\Omega; \Bbb R^n) be a mapping with nonnegative Jacobian J_F(x)=\det DF(x)\ge 0 for a.e. x in a domain \Omega\subset\Bbb R^n. The {\it dilatation} of F is defined (almost everywhere in \Omega) by the formula K(x)=\frac{|DF(x)|^n}{J_F(x)}\cdot Iwaniec and \v Sver\' ak \ncite{IS} have conjectured that if p\ge n-1 and K\in L^{p}_{\text{loc}}(\Omega) then F must be continuous, discrete and open. Moreover, they have confirmed this conjecture in the two-dimensional case n=2. In this article, we verify it in the higher- dimensional case n\ge 2 whenever p>n-1.
