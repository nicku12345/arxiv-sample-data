Let X be a closed, 1-dimensional, complex subvariety of \CC^2 and let \ol{\BB} be a closed ball in \CC^2 - X. Then there exists a Fatou-Bieberbach domain \Omega with X \subseteq \Omega \subseteq \CC^2 - \ol{\BB} and a biholomorphic map \Phi: \Omega \ra \CC^2 such that \CC^2 - \Phi(X) is Kobayashi hyperbolic. As corollaries, there is an embedding of the plane in \CC^2 whose complement is hyperbolic, and there is a nontrivial Fatou-Bieberbach domain containing any finite collection of complex lines.
