We obtain results on the asymptotic equidistribution of the pre-images of linear subspaces for sequences of rational mappings between projective spaces. As an application to complex dynamics, we consider the iterates P_k of a rational mapping P of \PP^n. We show, assuming a condition on the topological degree \lambda of P, that there is a probability measure \mu on \PP^n such that the discrete measures \lambda^{-k}P_k^*\delta_w converge to \mu for all w\in\PP^n outside a pluripolar set.
