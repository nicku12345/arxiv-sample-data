In this paper we continue our study of polynomial diffeomorphisms of C^2. Let us recall that there is an invariant measure \mu, which is the pluri-complex version of the harmonic measure of the Julia set for polynomial maps of C. In this paper we give an integral formula for the Lyapunov exponents of a polynomial automorphism with respect to \mu analogous to the Brolin-Manning formula polynomial maps of C. Our formula relates the Lyapunov exponents to the value of a Green function at a type of critical point which we define in this paper. We show that these critical points have a very natural dynamical interpretation.
