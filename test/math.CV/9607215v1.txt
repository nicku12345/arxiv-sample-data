We investigate compact complex manifolds of dimension three and second Betti number b_2(X) = 0. We are interested in the algebraic dimension a(X), which is by definition the transcendence degree of the field of meromorphic functions over the field of complex numbers. The topological Euler characteristic \chi_{\mathrm{ top}}(X)  equals the third Chern class c_3(X) by a theorem of Hopf. Our main result is that, if X is a compact 3-dimensional complex manifold with b_2(X) = 0 and a(X) > 0, then c_3(X) = \chi_{\rm top}(X) = 0, that is, we either have b_1(X) = 0, \ b_3(X) = 2 or b_1(X) = 1, \ b_3(X) = 0.
