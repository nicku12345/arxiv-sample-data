Given a polynomial diffeomorphism f: C^2 -> C^2 there is a set J_f\subset{\bf C}^2 which we call the Julia set of f. The set J_f\subset C^2 plays the role of the Julia set J\subset{\bf C} for a polynomial map of C. In the study of polynomial maps of C a great deal of attention has been paid to the connectivity of the Julia set. The focus of this paper is to investigate the J-connected/J-disconnected dichotomy in the case of polynomial diffeomorphisms of C^2.   The Jacobian determinant of f is constant. We make the standing assumption that |det\ Df|\le 1 (this can always be achieved by replacing f by f^{-1} if necessary). The set J^- is the set of points with bounded backward orbits. The set U^+ is the set of points with unbounded forward orbits. Let p be a periodic saddle point and let W^u(p) be its unstable manifold. The set W^u(p) will be a Riemann surface conformally equivalent to C.   Theorem 1. The following are equivalent:   1. For some periodic saddle point p, some component of W^u(p)\cap U^+ is simply connected.   2. The set J^-\cap U^+ has a lamination by simply connected leaves so that for any periodic saddle point p each component of W^u(p)\cap U^+ is a leaf of this lamination.   3. For any periodic saddle point p, each component of W^u(p)\cap U^+ is simply connected.   If f satisfies one of these conditions we say that f is unstably connected.   Theorem 2. The set J is connected if and only if f is unstably connected.   These results imply that we can determine the connectivity of J by considering the forward orbits of points in a single unstable manifold. These results open the door to computer exploration of the topology of two dimensional Julia sets and the connectivity locus in the parameter space.
