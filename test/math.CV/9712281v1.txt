This paper concerns with deformations of noncompact complex hyperbolic manifolds (with locally Bergman metric), varieties of discrete representations of their fundamental groups into PU(n,1) and the problem of (quasiconformal) stability of deformations of such groups and manifolds in the sense of L.Bers and D.Sullivan.   Despite Goldman-Millson-Yue rigidity results for such complex manifolds of infinite volume, we present different classes of such manifolds that allow non-trivial (quasi-Fuchsian) deformations and point out that such flexible manifolds have a common feature being Stein spaces. While deformations of complex surfaces from our first class are induced by quasiconformal homeomorphisms, non-rigid complex surfaces (homotopy equivalent to their complex analytic submanifolds) from another class are quasiconformally unstable, but nevertheless their deformations are induced by homeomorphisms.
