For plane curve singularities we construct a mixed Hodge structure (MHS) over the integers on the fundamental group of the Milnor fiber. The concept nearby fundamental group is introduced and we develop a theory of iterated integrals along elements of this group. We give an example for which the MHS on the nearby fundamental group detects a modulus which is invisible for the MHS on the vanishing cohomology.
