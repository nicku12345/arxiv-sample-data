We study holomorphic 2-forms on projective (or compact Kaehler) threefolds not of general type and prove that in almost all cases the 2-form is created by some standard process. This means roughly that every 2-form is induced by a meromorphic map to a surface, a torus or a symplectic manifold. If the 2-form has only finitely many zeroes, more precise results hold. Finally we prove that compact Kaehler threefolds with negative Kodaira dimension are uniruled unles they are simple, i.e. there is no positive dimensional compact subvariety through the general point of the manifold (these simple threefolds are expected not to exist). This generalises the fundamental result of Miyaoka and Mori to the Kaehler (non-simple) case.
