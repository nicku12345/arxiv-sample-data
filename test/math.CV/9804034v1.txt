In this article we study how the birational geometry of a normal projective variety X is influenced by a normal subvariety A \subset X. One of the most basic examples in this context is provided by the following situation. Let f:X\to Y be a surjective holomorphic map with connected fibers between compact connected complex manifolds. It is well known that given a general fiber A of f we have  \kappa(X)\le \kappa(A)+\dim Y.  This article grew out of the realization that this result should be true with \dim Y replaced by the codimension \cod_X A for a pair (X,A) consisting of a normal subvariety A of a compact normal variety X under weak semipositivity conditions on the normal sheaf of A and the weak singularity condition \cod_A (A\cap\sing X)\ge 2. We shall now state our main results in the special case of a submanifold A in a projective manifold X and we also simplify the semipositivity notion.
