Let X\subset P^N be an n-dimensional connected projective submanifold of projective space. Let p : P^N\to P^{N-q-1} denote the projection from a linear P^q\subset P^N. Assuming that X\not\subset P^q we have the induced rational mapping \psi:=p_X: X\to P^{N-q-1}. This article started as an attempt to understand the structure of this mapping when \psi has a lower dimensional image. In this case of necessity we have Y := X\cap P^q is nonempty. We have in this article studied a closely related question, which includes many special cases including the case when the center of the projection \pn q is contained in X.   PROBLEM. Let Y be a proper connected k-dimensional projective submanifold of an n-dimensional projective manifold X. Assume that k>0. Let L be a very ample line bundle on X such that  L\otimes I_Y is spanned by global sections, where I_Y denotes the ideal sheaf of Y in X. Describe the structure of (X,Y,L) under the additional assumption that the image of X under the mapping \psi associated to | L\otimes I_Y| is lower dimensional.
