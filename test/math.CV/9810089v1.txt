We show that the Julia set of a non-elementary rational semigroup G is uniformly perfect when there is a uniform bound on the Lipschitz constants of the generators of G. This also proves that the limit set of a non-elementary Moebius group is uniformly perfect when there is a uniform bound on the Lipschitz constants of the generators of the group and this implies that the limit set of a finitely generated non-elementary Kleinian group is uniformly perfect.
