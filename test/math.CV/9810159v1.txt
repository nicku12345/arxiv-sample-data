We prove in this note a result on extension of meromorphic mappings, which can be considered as a direct generalisation of the Hartogs extension theorem for holomorphic functions. Namely:   THEOREM. Every meromorphic mapping f:H_n^q(r)\to Y, where Y is a q - -complete complex space, extends to a meromorphic mapping from \Delta^{n+q} to Y. Here H_n^q(r):=\Delta^n\times (\Delta^q\setminus \bar\Delta_r^q)\cup \Delta_r^n\times \Delta^q is a "q-concave" Hartogs figure in C^{n+q}.   Remark that in the case q=1, i.e. when Y is Stein, the statement of the Theorem is exactly the Theorem of Hartogs.
