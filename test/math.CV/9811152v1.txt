We construct two classes of singular Kobayashi hyperbolic surfaces in P^3. The first consists of generic projections of the cartesian square V = C \times C of a generic genus g \ge 2 curve C smoothly embedded in P^5. These surfaces have C-hyperbolic normalizations; we give some lower bounds for their degrees and provide an example of degree 32. The second class of examples of hyperbolic surfaces in P^3 is provided by generic projections of the symmetric square V' = C_2 of a generic genus g \ge 3 curve C. The minimal degree of these surfaces is 16, but this time the normalizations are not C-hyperbolic.
