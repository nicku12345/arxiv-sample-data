We present a proof of the existence and uniqueness theorem of a normalizing biholomorphic mapping to Chern-Moser normal form. The explicit form of the equation of a chain on a real hyperquadric is obtained. We show a family of normal forms of nondegenerate real hypersurfaces including Chern-Moser normal form.
