We show a refined version of the existence and uniqueness theorem to Chern-Moser normal form. The class of nondegenerate real hypersurfaces in normal form has a natural group action. Umbilic point is defined via normal form. Nondegenerate analytic real hypersurfaces are locally biholomorphic to a real hyperquadric whenever every point is umbilic in this sense.
