The general theory of parabolic geometries is applied to the study of the normal Cartan connections for all hyperbolic and elliptic 6-dimensional CR-manifolds of codimension two. The geometric meaning of the individual components of the torsion is explained and the chains of dimensions one and two are discussed. This seems to be the first application of the general methods to a geometry with a non-connected and non-simple structure group.
