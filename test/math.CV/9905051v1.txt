In previous work of the authors and their collaborators (see Progress in Math, vol. 114, Birk\"auser, 1993) it was shown how the equivalence of several constructions of residue currents associated to complete intersection families of (germs of) holomorphic functions in {\bf C}^n could be profitably used to solve algebraic problems like effective versions of the Nullstellensatz. In this work we explain how an application of similar ideas in the non-complete intersection case leads to a remarkable algebraic result, namely:   Let P_1,...,P_n be n polynomials in n variables such that the zero set of P_1,...,P_n can be defined as the zero set of P_1,...,P_\nu, with \nu < n. Then, the Jacobian J(P_1,...,P_n) of (P_1,...,P_n) is in the ideal generated by the P_j, j=1,...,n.   The same methods lead to further insights into the construction of Green currents associated to effective cycles in projective space.
