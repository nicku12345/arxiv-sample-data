In this paper, we consider real hypersurfaces M in \Bbb C^3 (or more generally, 5-dimensional CR manifolds of hypersurface type) at uniformly Levi degenerate points, i.e. Levi degenerate points such that the rank of the Levi form is constant in a neighborhood. We also require the hypersurface to satisfy a certain second order nondegeneracy condition (called 2-nondegeneracy) at the point. Our first result is the construction of a principal bundle P\to M with an absolute parallelism, uniquely determined by the CR structure on M, which reduces the question of whether two such CR manifolds M and M' are CR equivalent to the corresponding equivalence problem for the parallelized bundles P and P'.   A basic example of a hypersurface of the type under consideration is the tube \Gamma_\bC over the light cone. Our second result is the characterization of \Gamma_\bC by vanishing curvature conditions in the spirit of the characterization of the unit sphere as the flat model for strongly pseudoconvex hypersurfaces in \bC^{n+1} in terms of the Cartan-Chern-Moser connection.
