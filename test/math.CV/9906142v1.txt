We show that there does not exist a Kobayashi hyperbolic complex manifold of dimension n\ne 3, whose group of holomorphic automorphisms has dimension n^2+1 and that, if a 3-dimensional connected hyperbolic complex manifold has automorphism group of dimension 10, then it is holomorphically equivalent to the Siegel space. These results complement earlier theorems of the authors on the possible dimensions of automorphism groups of domains in comlex space. The paper also contains a proof of our earlier result on characterizing n-dimensional hyperbolic complex manifolds with automorphism groups of dimension \ge n^2+2.
