In this paper, we prove that any perfect complex of D^{\infty}-modules may be reconstructed from its holomorphic solution complex provided that we keep track of the natural topology of this last complex. This is to be compared with the reconstruction theorem for regular holonomic D-modules which follows from the well-known Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. To obtain our result, we consider sheaves of holomorphic functions as sheaves with values in the category of ind-Banach spaces and study some of their homological properties. In particular, we prove that a K\"{u}nneth formula holds for them and we compute their Poincar\'{e}-Verdier duals. As a corollary, we obtain the form of the kernels of ``continuous'' cohomological correspondences between sheaves of holomorphic forms. This allows us to prove a kind of holomorphic Schwartz' kernel theorem and to show that D^{\infty}=RHomtop(O,O). Our reconstruction theorem is a direct consequence of this last isomorphism. Note that the main problem is the vanishing of the topological Ext's and that this vanishing is a consequence of the acyclicity theorems for DFN spaces which are established in the paper.
