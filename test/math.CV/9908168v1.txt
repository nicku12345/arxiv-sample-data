We study the structure of the maximal ideal space M(H^{\infty}) of the algebra H^{\infty}=H^{\infty}(\Di) of bounded analytic functions defined on the open unit disk \Di\subset\Co. Based on the fact that dim\ M(H^{\infty})=2 we prove for H^{\infty} the matrix-valued corona theorem. Our results heavily rely on the topological construction describing maximal ideal spaces of certain algebras of continuous functions defined on the covering spaces of compact manifolds.
