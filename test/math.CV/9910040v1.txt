For a strongly pseudo-convex complex Finsler manifold M, a bundle U of adapted unitary frames is canonically defined. A non-linear Hermitian connection on U, invariant under local biholomorphic isometries, is given and it proved to be unique. By means of such connection, an absolute parallelism on U is determined and a new set of structure functions which generate all the isometric invariants of a Finsler metric is obtained. A pseudo-convex complex Finsler manifolds M, which admits a totally geodesic complex curve with a given constant holomorphic sectional curvature through any point and any direction, is called E-manifold. Main examples of E-manifolds are the smoothly bounded, strictly convex domains in C^n, endowed with the Kobayashi metric. A complete characterization of E-manifolds, using the previously defined structure functions, is given and a smaller set of generating functions for the isometric invariants of E-manifolds is determined.
