Automorphic forms on a bounded symmetric domain D=G/K can be viewed as holomorphic sections of L^{\otimes k}, where L is a quantizing line bundle on a compact quotient of D and k is a positive integer.   Let \Gamma be a cocompact discrete subgroup of SU(n,1) which acts freely on SU(n,1)/U(n). We suggest a construction of relative Poincar\'e series associated to loxodromic elements in \Gamma. In complex dimension 2 we describe Bohr-Sommerfeld tori in \Gamma\backslash SU(n,1)/U(n) associated to hyperbolic elements of \Gamma and prove that the relative Poincar\'e series associated to the hyperbolic elements of \Gamma are not identically zero for large k.
