We construct the integrable model corresponding to the \N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with matter in the antisymmetric representation, using the spectral curve found by Landsteiner and Lopez through M Theory. The model turns out to be the Hamiltonian reduction of a N+2 periodic spin chain model, which is Hamiltonian with respect to the universal symplectic form we had constructed earlier for general soliton equations in the Lax or Zakharov-Shabat representation.
