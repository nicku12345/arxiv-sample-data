Starting from suitable tableaux over finite dimensional Lie algebras, we provide a scheme for producing involutive linear Pfaffian systems related to various classes of submanifolds in homogeneous spaces which constitute integrable systems. These include isothermic surfaces, Willmore surfaces, and other classical soliton surfaces. Completely integrable equations such as the G/G_0-system of Terng and the curved flat system of Ferus-Pedit may be obtained as special cases of this construction. Some classes of surfaces in projective differential geometry whose Gauss-Codazzi equations are associated with tableaux over sl(4,R) are discussed.
