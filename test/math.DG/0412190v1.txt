We show that, up to some natural normalizations, the moduli space of singly periodic complete embedded maximal surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski space \l^3=(\r^3,dx_1^2+dx_2^2-dx_3^2), with fundamental piece having a finite number (n+1) of singularities, is a real analytic manifold of dimension 3n+4. The underlying topology agrees with the topology of uniform convergence of graphs on compact subsets of \{x_3=0\}.
