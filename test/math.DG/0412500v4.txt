Using symplectic topology and the Radon transform, we prove that smooth 4-dimensional projective planes are diffeomorphic to \mathbb{CP}^2. We define the notion of a plane curve in a smooth projective plane, show that plane curves in high dimensional regular planes are lines, prove that homeomorphisms preserving plane curves are smooth collineations, and prove a variety of results analogous to the theory of classical projective planes.
