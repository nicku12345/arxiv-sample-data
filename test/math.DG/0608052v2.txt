In this paper, we use Clifford algebra and the spinor calculus to study the complex structures on Euclidean space R^8 and the spheres S^4,S^6. By the spin representation of G(2,8)\subset Spin(8) we show that the Grassmann manifold G(2,8) can be looked as the set of orthogonal complex structures on R^8. In this way, we show that G(2,8) and CP^{3} can be looked as twistor spaces of S^6 and S^4 respectively. Then we show that there is no almost complex structure on sphere S^4 and there is no orthogonal complex structure on the sphere S^6.
