This paper shows that the Grassmann Manifolds G_{\bf F}(n,N) can all be imbedded in an Euclidean space M_{\bf F}(N) naturally and the imbedding can be realized by the eigenfunctions of Laplacian \triangle on G_{\bf F}(n,N). They are all minimal submanifolds in some spheres of M_{\bf F}(N) respectively. Using these imbeddings, we construct some degenerate Morse functions on Grassmann Manifolds, show that the homology of the complex and quaternion Grassmann Manifolds can be computed easily.
