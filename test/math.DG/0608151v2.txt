The aim of this paper is to give a proof the Frankel conjecture by using the Kahler Ricci flow alone without assuming apriori the existence of Kahler Einstein metrics. However, there is an essential difference between the real case and the Kahler case. I didn't realize this difference in the calculation of the previous version thus made a mistake on the crucial point.
