We present a construction of a canonical G_2 structure on the unit sphere tangent bundle S_M of any given orientable Riemannian 4-manifold M. Such structure is never geometric or 1-flat, but seems full of other possibilities. We start by the study of the most basic properties of our construction. The structure is co-calibrated if, and only if, M is an Einstein manifold. The fibres are always associative. In fact, the associated 3-form results from a linear combination of three other volume 3-forms, one of which is the volume of the fibres. We also give new examples of co-calibrated structures on well known spaces. We hope this contributes both to the knowledge of special geometries and to the study of 4-manifolds.
