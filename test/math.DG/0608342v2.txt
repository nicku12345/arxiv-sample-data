Let {\mathscr F}(N\times \mathbb{R}) be the set of all closed H-hypersurfaces M\subset N\times \mathbb{R}, where N is a simply connected complete Riemannian n-manifold with sectional curvature K_{N}\leq -\kappa^{2}<0. We show that {\Hm}(N\times \mathbb{R})=\inf_{M\in {\mathscr F}(N\times \mathbb{R})}\{| H_{M}| \}\geq (n-1)\kappa/n .
