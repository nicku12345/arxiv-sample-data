Let \widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n}) be the set of orthogonal complex structures on   TS^{2n}. We show that the twistor space \widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n}) is a Kaehler manifold. Then we show that an orthogonal almost complex structure J_f on S^{2n} is integrable if and only if the corresponding section f\colon\; S^{2n}\to \widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n})  is holomorphic. These shows there is no integrable orthogonal complex structure on the sphere S^{2n} for n>1. We also show that there is no complex structure in a neighborhood of the space \widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n}). The method is to study the first Chern class of T^{(1,0)}S^{2n}.
