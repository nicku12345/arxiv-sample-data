In the present paper, we consider two different {\em Finsler} structures L and L^* on the same base manifold M, with no relation preassumed between them. \par Introducing the \pi-tensor field representing the difference between the Cartan connections associated with L and L^*, we investigate the conditions, to be satisfied by this \pi-tensor field, for the geometric objects associated with L and L^* to have the same properties. Among the items investigated in the paper, we consider the properties of being a geodesic, a Jacobi field, a Berwald manifold, a locally Minkowskian manifold and a Landsberg manifold. \par It should be noticed that our approach is intrinsic, i.e., it does not make use of local coordinate techniques.
