For a compact, smooth C^r orbifold (without boundary), we show that the topological structure of the orbifold diffeomorphism group is a Banach manifold for finite r \ge 1 and a Frechet manifold if r=infty. In each case, the local model is the separable Banach (Frechet) space of C^r (C^infty, resp.) orbisections of the tangent orbibundle.
