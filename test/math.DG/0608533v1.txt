We give some fundamental properties of the induced structures on submanifolds immersed in almost product or locally product Riemannian manifolds. We study the induced structure by the composition of two isometric immersions on submanifolds in an almost product Riemannian manifold. We give an effective construction for some induced structures on submanifolds of codimension 1 or 2 in Euclidean space.
