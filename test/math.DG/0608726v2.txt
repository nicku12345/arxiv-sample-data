Using techniques of integrable systems, we study a Weierstrass representation formula for timelike surfaces with prescribed mean curvature in Minkowski 3-space. It is shown that timelike minimal surfaces are obtained by integrating a pair of Lorentz holomorphic and Lorentz antiholomorphic null curves in Minkowski 3-space. The relationship between timelike minimal surfaces and bosonic Nambu-Goto string worldsheets in spacetime is also discussed in the appendix.
