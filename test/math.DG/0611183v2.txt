Given a coassociative 4-fold N with a conical singularity in a varphi-closed 7-manifold M (a manifold endowed with a distinguished closed 3-form varphi), we construct a smooth family, {N'(t): t\in(0,tau)} for some tau>0, of (smooth, nonsingular,) compact coassociative 4-folds in M which converge to N in the sense of currents, in geometric measure theory, as t tends to 0. This realisation of desingularizations of N is achieved by gluing in an asymptotically conical coassociative 4-fold in R^7, dilated by t, then deforming the resulting compact submanifold of M to the required coassociative 4-fold.
