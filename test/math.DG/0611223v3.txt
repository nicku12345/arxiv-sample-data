We study the space of nearly K\"{a}hler structures on compact 6-dimensional manifolds. In particular, we prove that the space of infinitesimal deformations of a strictly nearly K\"{a}hler structure (with scalar curvature scal) modulo the group of diffeomorphisms, is isomorphic to the space of primitive co-closed (1,1)-eigenforms of the Laplace operator for the eigenvalue 2scal/5.
