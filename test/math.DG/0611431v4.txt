We establish a criterion for when an abelian extension of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras integrates to a corresponding Lie group extension \hat{G} of G by A, where G is a connected, simply connected Lie group and A is a quotient of its Lie algebra by some discrete subgroup. When G is non-simply connected, the kernel A is replaced by a central extension \hat{A} of \pi_1(G) by A.
