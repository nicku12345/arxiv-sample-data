We construct a new family of curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds modeled on \mathbb{R}^{3k+2} for integers k \geq 1. In contrast to previously known examples, the signature may be chosen to be (k+1+a, k+1+b) where a,b \in \mathbb{N} \bigcup \{0\} and a+b = k. The structure group of the 0-model of this family is studied, and is shown to be indecomposable. Several invariants that are not of Weyl type are found which will show that, in general, the members of this family are not locally homogeneous.
