In this paper, we classify 8-dimensional manifolds M admitting an SU(3) action of cohomogeneity one such that (i) M is simply connected and the orbit space M/G is isomorphic to [0,1], and (ii) M/G=S^1 and the principal orbits are simply connected. We discuss applications to the study of the group manifold SU(3) and to 8-dimensional quaternion-Kahler spaces.
