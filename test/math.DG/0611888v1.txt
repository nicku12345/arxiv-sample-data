We provide a congruence theorem for minimal surfaces in S^5 with constant contact angle using Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations. More precisely, we prove that Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations for minimal surfaces in S^5 with constant contact angle satisfy an equation for the Laplacian of the holomorphic angle. Also, we will give a characterization of flat minimal surfaces in S^5 with constant contact angle.
