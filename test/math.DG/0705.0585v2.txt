We prove that every complete connected immersed surface with positive extrinsic curvature K in H^2\times R must be properly embedded, homeomorphic to a sphere or a plane and, in the latter case, study the behavior of the end. Then, we focus our attention on surfaces with positive constant extrinsic curvature (K-surfaces). We establish that the only complete K-surfaces in S^2\times R and H^2\times R are rotational spheres. Here are the key steps to achieve this. First height estimates for compact K-surfaces in a general ambient space M^2\times R with boundary in a slice are obtained. Then distance estimates for compact K-surfaces (and H-surfaces) in H^2\times R with boundary on a vertical plane are obtained. Finally we construct a quadratic form with isolated zeroes of negative index.
