Following the lines of a celebrated result by R. Bott (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 9, 1956) we study the Morse index of the iterated of a closed geodesic in stationary Lorentzian manifolds, or, more generally, of a closed Lorentzian geodesic that admits a timelike periodic Jacobi field. Given one such closed geodesic \gamma, we prove the existence of a locally constant integer valued map \Lambda_\gamma on the unit circle with the property that the Morse index of the iterated \gamma^N is equal, up to a correction term \epsilon_\gamma\in\{0,1\}, to the sum of the values of \Lambda_\gamma at the N-th roots of unity. The discontinuities of \Lambda_\gamma occur at a finite number of points of the unit circle, that are special eigenvalues of the linearized Poincar\'e map of \gamma. We discuss some applications of the theory.
