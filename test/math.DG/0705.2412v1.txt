In this paper, we complete the proof of an equivalence given by Nye and Singer of the equivalence between calorons (instantons on S^1\times R^3) and solutions to Nahm's equations over the circle, both satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. Many of the key ingredients are provided by a third way of encoding the same data which involves twistors and complex geometry.
