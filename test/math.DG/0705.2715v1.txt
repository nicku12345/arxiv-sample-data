We give an account of the construction of exterior differential systems based on the notion of tableaux over Lie algebras as developed in [Comm. Anal. Geom 14 (2006), 475-496; math.DG/0412169]. The definition of a tableau over a Lie algebra is revisited and extended in the light of the formalism of the Spencer cohomology; the question of involutiveness for the associated systems and their prolongations is addressed; examples are discussed.
