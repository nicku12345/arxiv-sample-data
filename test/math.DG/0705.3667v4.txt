We show that an eternal solution to a complete, locally conformally flat Yamabe flow, \frac{\partial}{\partial t} g = -Rg, with uniformly bounded scalar curvature and positive Ricci curvature at t = 0, where the scalar curvature assumes its maximum is a gradient steady soliton. As an application of that, we study the blow up behavior of g(t) at the maximal time of existence, T < \infty. We assume that (M,g(\cdot, t)) satisfies (i) the injectivity radius bound {\bf or} (ii) the Schouten tensor is positive at time t = 0 and the scalar curvature bounded at each time-slice. We show that the singularity the flow develops at time T is always of type I.
