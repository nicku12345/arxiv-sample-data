Based on projective representations of smooth Deligne cohomology groups, we introduce an analogue of the space of conformal blocks to compact oriented (4k+2)-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with boundary. For the standard (4k+2)-dimensional disk, we compute the space concretely to prove that its dimension is finite.
