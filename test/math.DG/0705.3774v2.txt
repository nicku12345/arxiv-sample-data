The \textit{parabolic scalar curvature equation} is a reaction-diffusion type equation on an (n-1)-manifold \Sigma, the time variable of which shall be denoted by r. Given a function R on [r_0,r_1)\times\Sigma and a family of metrics \gamma(r) on \Sigma, when the coefficients of this equation are appropriately defined in terms of \gamma and R, positive solutions give metrics of prescribed scalar curvature R on [r_0,r_1)\times\Sigma in the form \[ g=u^2dr^2+r^2\gamma.\] If the area element of r^2\gamma is expanding for increasing r, then the equation is parabolic, and the basic existence problem is to take positive initial data at some r=r_0 and solve for u on the maximal interval of existence, which above was implicitly assumed to be I=[r_0,r_1); one often hopes that r_1=\infty. However, the case of greatest physical interest, R>0, often leads to blow-up in finite time so that r_1<\infty. It is the purpose of the present work to investigate the situation in which the blow-up nonetheless occurs in such a way that g is continuously extendible to \bar M=[r_0,r_1]\times\Sigma as a manifold with totally geodesic outer boundary at r=r_1.
