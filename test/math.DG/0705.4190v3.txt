In this paper, we prove that for every Finsler n-sphere (S^n, F) for n\ge 3 with reversibility \lambda and flag curvature K satisfying (\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+1})^2<K\le 1, either there exist infinitely many prime closed geodesics or there exists one elliptic closed geodesic whose linearized Poincar\'e map has at least one eigenvalue which is of the form \exp(\pi i \mu) with an irrational \mu. Furthermore, there always exist three prime closed geodesics on any (S^3, F) satisfying the above pinching condition.
