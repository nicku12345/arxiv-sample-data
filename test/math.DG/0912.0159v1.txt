In this paper, we consider the intensity surface of a 2D image, we study the evolution of the symmetry sets (and medial axes) of 1-parameter families of iso-intensity curves. This extends the investigation done on 1-parameter families of smooth plane curves (Bruce and Giblin, Giblin and Kimia, etc.) to the general case when the family of curves includes a singular member, as will happen if the curves are obtained by taking plane sections of a smooth surface, at the moment when the plane becomes tangent to the surface.   Looking at those surface sections as isophote curves, of the pixel values of an image embedded in the real plane, this allows us to propose to combine object representation using a skeleton or symmetry set representation and the appearance modelling by representing image information as a collection of medial representations for the level-sets of an image.
