The Berwald-Landsberg problem is considered for two dimensional manifolds. We sketch the proof that there are not \mathcal{C}^5-regular y-global pure Landsberg surfaces. The method used consists on considerer the holonomy representation of the averaged Chern connection and then exhausting all the possible cases, showing that in dimension 2 Landsberg condition implies Berwald condition.
