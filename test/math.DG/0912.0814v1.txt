Any nonpositively curved symmetric space admits a topological compactification, namely the Hadamard compactification. For rank one spaces, this topological compactification can be endowed with a differentiable structure such that the action of the isometry group is differentiable. Moreover, the restriction of the action on the boundary leads to a flat model for some geometry (conformal, CR or quaternionic CR depending of the space). One can ask whether such a differentiable compactification exists for higher rank spaces, hopefully leading to some knew geometry to explore. In this paper we answer negatively.
