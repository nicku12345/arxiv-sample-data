By using results by D. Witte on the superigidity of lattices in solvable Lie groups we get a different proof of a recent remarkable result obtained by D. Guan on the de Rham cohomology of a compact solvmanifold, i.e. of a quotient of a connected and simply connected solvable Lie group G by a lattice \Gamma. This result can be applied to compute the Betti numbers of a compact solvmanifold G/\Gamma even in the case that the solvable Lie group G and the lattice \Gamma do not satisfy the Mostow condition.
