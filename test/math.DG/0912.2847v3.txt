For any open orientable surface M and convex domain \Omega\subset \mathbb{C}^3, there exists a Riemann surface N homeomorphic to M and a complete proper null curve F:N\to\Omega. This result follows from a general existence theorem with many applications. Among them, the followings: For any convex domain \Omega in \mathbb{C}^2 there exist a Riemann surface N homeomorphic to M and a complete proper holomorphic immersion F:N\to\Omega. Furthermore, if D \subset \mathbb{R}^2 is a convex domain and \Omega is the solid right cylinder \{x \in \mathbb{C}^2 | {Re}(x) \in D\}, then F can be chosen so that {\rm Re}(F):N\to D is proper. There exists a Riemann surface N homeomorphic to M and a complete bounded holomorphic null immersion F:N \to {\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C}). There exists a complete bounded CMC-1 immersion X:M \to \mathbb{H}^3. For any convex domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3 there exists a complete proper minimal immersion (X_j)_{j=1,2,3}:M \to \Omega with vanishing flux. Furthermore, if D \subset \mathbb{R}^2 is a convex domain and \Omega=\{(x_j)_{j=1,2,3} \in \mathbb{R}^3 | (x_1,x_2) \in D\}, then X can be chosen so that (X_1,X_2):M\to D is proper. Any of the above surfaces can be chosen with hyperbolic conformal structure.
