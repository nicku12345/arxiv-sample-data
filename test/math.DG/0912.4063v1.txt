In this article a relation between curvature functionals for surfaces in the Euclidean space and area functionals in relative differential geometry will be given. Relative differential geometry can be described as the geometry of surfaces in the affine space, endowed with a distinguished "relative normal vector field" which generalises the notion of unit normal vector field N from Euclidean differential geometry. A concise review of relative differential geometry will be presented. The main result, to which the title of this article refers, will be given in the third section. Here we consider, for a function f of two variables, relative normal vector fields of the form f(H,K)\,N-\grad_{\II}(f(H,K)) for non-degenerate surfaces in the Euclidean three-dimensional space. A comparison of the variation of the curvature functional \int f(H,K)\,\dd\Omega with the relative area functional obtained from the above relative normal vector field, results in a distinguishing property for the one-parameter family of relative normal vector fields which was introduced by F.\ Manhart, and which is obtained by choosing f(H,K)=|K|^{\alpha} (where we will assume that \alpha\neq 1). More precisely, the following will be shown in theorem~6: ``{The curvature functionals (\ast) for which the critical points coincide with the relative-minimal surfaces with respect to the relative normal vector field (\dagger), are essentially those obtained from Manhart's family}." In the fourth section, we give a characterisation of the sphere by means of relations between the support function and the curvatures. In the last section, we combine the previously described results and arrive at a variational characterisation of the sphere.
