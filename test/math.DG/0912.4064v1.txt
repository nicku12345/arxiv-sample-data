The two main topics of this text are as follows: Firstly, three modifications of the theorem of Beltrami will be presented for diffeomorphisms between Riemannian manifolds and a space form which preserve the geodesic circles, the geodesic hyperspheres, or the minimal surfaces, respectively. Secondly, it is defined what it means for an infinitesimal deformation of a metric to preserve the geodesics up to first order, and a corresponding infinitesimal version of Beltrami's theorem is given.
