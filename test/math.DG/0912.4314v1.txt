Inspired by the work of Boris Vertman on refined analytic torsion for manifolds with boundary, in this paper we extend the construction of the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion to manifolds with boundary. We also compare it with the refined analytic torsion on manifolds with boundary. As a byproduct of the gluing formula for refined analytic torsion and the comparison theorem for the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion and the refined analytic torsion, we establish the gluing formula for the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion in the case that the Hermitian metric is flat.
