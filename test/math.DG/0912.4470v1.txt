We consider the evolution of a n-dimensional convex hypersurface in the euclidean space under mean curvature flow with densities e^{\varepsilon \frac12 n\mu^2 |x|^2}, \varepsilon =\pm 1, and completely determine it depending on the relation between \mu and the upper or lower bound of the normal curvatures of the evolving hypersurface at time 0.
