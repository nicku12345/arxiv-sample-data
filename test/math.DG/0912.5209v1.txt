The aim of this paper is to describe the local Bianchi identities for an h-normal \Gamma-linear connection of Cartan type \nabla\Gamma on the first-order jet space J^1(R,M). In this direction, we present the local expressions of the adapted components of the torsion and curvature d-tensors produced by \nabla\Gamma and we give the general local expressions of Bianchi identities which connect these d-torsions and d-curvatures.
