We prove the following result: Let (X,g_0) be a complete, connected 4-manifold with uniformly positive isotropic curvature and with bounded geometry. Then there is a finite collection \mathcal{F} of manifolds of the form \mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R} /G, where G is a fixed point free discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the standard metric on \mathbb{S}^3\times \mathbb{R}, such that X is diffeomorphic to a (possibly infinite) connected sum of copies of \mathbb{S}^4,\mathbb{RP}^4 and/or members of \mathcal{F}. This extends recent work of Chen-Tang-Zhu and Huang. We also extend the above result to the case of orbifolds. The proof uses Ricci flow with surgery on complete orbifolds.
