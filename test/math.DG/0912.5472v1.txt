A Riemannian manifold is called Weyl homogeneous, if its Weyl tensors at any two points are "the same", up to a positive multiple. A Weyl homogeneous manifold is modeled on a homogeneous space M_0, if its Weyl tensor at every point is "the same" as the Weyl tensor of M_0, up to a positive multiple. We prove that a Weyl homogeneous manifold M^n, n \ge 4, modeled on an irreducible symmetric space M_0 of types II or IV (compact simple Lie group with a bi-invariant metric or its noncompact dual) is conformally equivalent to M_0.
