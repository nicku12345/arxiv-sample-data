given two minimal surfaces embedded in \S3 of genus g we prove the existence of a sequence of non-congruent compact minimal surfaces embedded in \S3 of genus g that converges in C^{2,\alpha} to a compact embedded minimal surface provided some conditions are satisfied. These conditions also imply that, if any of these two surfaces is embedded by the first eigenvalue, so is the other.
