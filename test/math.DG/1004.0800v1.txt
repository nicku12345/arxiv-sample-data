This is an expository paper, which provides a first introduction to geometric structures on TM\oplus T^*M. The paper contains definitions and characteristic properties of generalized complex, generalized Kaehler, generalized (normal, almost) contact and generalized Sasakian structures. A few of these properties are new.
