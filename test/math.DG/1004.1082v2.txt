We present a new method for manufacturing complex-valued harmonic morphisms from a wide class of Riemannian Lie groups. This yields new solutions from an important family of homogeneous Hadamard manifolds. We also give a new method for constructing left-invariant foliations on a large class of Lie groups producing harmonic morphisms
