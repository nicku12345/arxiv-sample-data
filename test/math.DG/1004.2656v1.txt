We prove a general fusion theorem for complete orientable minimal surfaces in \mathbb{R}^3 with finite total curvature. As a consequence, complete orientable minimal surfaces of weak finite total curvature with exotic geometry are produced. More specifically, universal surfaces (i.e., surfaces from which all minimal surfaces can be recovered) and space-filling surfaces with arbitrary genus and no symmetries.
