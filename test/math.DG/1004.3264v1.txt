A complex symplectic structure on a Lie algebra \lie h is an integrable complex structure J with a closed non-degenerate (2,0)-form. It is determined by J and the real part \Omega of the (2,0)-form. Suppose that \lie h is a semi-direct product \lie g\ltimes V, and both \lie g and V are Lagrangian with respect to \Omega and totally real with respect to J. This note shows that \lie g\ltimes V is its own weak mirror image in the sense that the associated differential Gerstenhaber algebras controlling the extended deformations of \Omega and J are isomorphic. The geometry of (\Omega, J) on the semi-direct product \lie g\ltimes V is also shown to be equivalent to that of a torsion-free flat symplectic connection on the Lie algebra \lie g. By further exploring a relation between (J, \Omega) with hypersymplectic algebras, we find an inductive process to build families of complex symplectic algebras of dimension 8n from the data of the 4n-dimensional ones.
