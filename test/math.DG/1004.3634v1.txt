Criterions for constancy of the holomorphic sectional curvature and the antiholomorphic sectional curvature are proved for almost Hermitian manifolds. It is shown, that an almost Hermitian manifold satisfying the axiom of antiholomorphic planes or the axiom of antiholomorphic spheres is a real or a complex space form.
