In this note, using Calabi's method, we construct rotationally symmetric Kahler-Ricci solitons on the total space of direct sum of fixed hermitian line bundle and its projective compactification, where the curvature of hermitian line bundle is Kahler-Einstein. These examples generalize the construction of Koiso, Cao and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf.
