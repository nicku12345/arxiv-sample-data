A measured solenoid is a compact laminated space endowed with a transversal measure. The De Rham L^2-cohomology of the solenoid is defined by using differential forms which are smooth in the leafwise directions and L^2 in the transversal direction. We develop the theory of harmonic forms for Riemannian measured solenoids, and prove that this computes the De Rham L^2-cohomology of the solenoid. This implies in particular a Poincare duality result.
