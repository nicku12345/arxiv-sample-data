In this note we prove that a complex hyperbolic triangle group of type (m,m,infinity), i.e. a group of isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane, generated by complex reflections in three complex geodesics meeting at angles Pi/m, Pi/m and 0, is not discrete if the product of the three generators is regular elliptic.
