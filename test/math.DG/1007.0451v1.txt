Let dx_i/dt=f_i(x_1,\cdots,x_n), (i=1,\cdots,n) be a system of n first order autonomous ordinary differential equations. We use E. Cartan's equivalence method to study the invariants of this system under diffeomorphisms of the form \Phi(t,x_1,\cdots,x_n)=(\varphi_0(t),\varphi_1(x_1),\cdots,\varphi_1(x_1)).
