In this paper, we prove the nonexistence of L^2 harmonic 1-forms on a complete super stable minimal submanifold M in hyperbolic space under the assumption that the first eigenvalue \lambda_1 (M) for the Laplace operator on M is bounded below by (2n-1)(n-1). Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions for minimal submanifolds in hyperbolic space to be super stable.
