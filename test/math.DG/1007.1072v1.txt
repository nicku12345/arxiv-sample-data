We construct compact arbitrary Euler characteristic orientable and non-orientable minimal surfaces in the Berger spheres. Besides we show an interesting family of surfaces that are minimal in every Berger sphere, characterizing them by this property. Finally we construct, via the Daniel correspondence, new examples of constant mean curvature surfaces in the products S^2 x R, H^2 x R and in the Heisenberg group with many symmetries.
