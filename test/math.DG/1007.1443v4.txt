We investigate 3-dimensional almost Kenmotsu manifolds satisfying special types of nullity conditions depending on two smooth functions \kappa,\mu. When either \kappa<-1 and \mu=0 or h=0, such conditions coincide with the \kappa-nullity condition which we show to be equivalent to the \eta-Einstein one. As an application of this result, we obtain examples of N(\kappa)-quasi Einstein manifolds. Moreover, for the aforementioned manifolds, some complete local descriptions of their structure are established, building local "models" for each of them.
