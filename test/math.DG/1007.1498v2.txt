In this work, we will verify some comparison results on Kahler manifolds. They are complex Hessian comparison for the distance function from a closed complex submanifold of a Kahler manifold with holomorphic bisectional curvature bounded below by a constant, eigenvalue comparison and volume comparison in terms of scalar curvature. This work is motivated by comparison results of Li and Wang .
