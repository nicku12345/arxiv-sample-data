In this paper, we give a lower bound for the spectrum of the Laplacian on minimal hypersurfaces immersed into H^m \times R. As an application, in dimension 2, we prove that a complete minimal surface with finite total extrinsic curvature has finite index. On the other hand, for stable, minimal surfaces in H^3 or in H^2 \times \R, we give an upper bound on the infimum of the spectrum of the Laplacian and on the volume growth.
