It is well-known that non-constant holomorphic functions do not exist on a compact complex manifold. This statement is false for a supermanifold with a compact reduction. In this paper we study the question under what conditions non-constant holomorphic functions do not exist on a compact homogeneous complex supermanifold. We describe also the vector bundles determined by split homogeneous complex supermanifolds.   As an application, we compute the algebra of holomorphic functions on the classical flag supermanifolds which were introduced by Yu.I. Manin.
