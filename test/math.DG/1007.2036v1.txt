For a compact contact manifold it is shown that the anisotropic Folland-Stein function spaces form an algebra. The notion of anisotropic regularity is extended to define the space of Folland-Stein contact diffeomorphisms, which is shown to be a topological group under composition and a smooth Hilbert manifold. These results are used in a subsequent paper to analyze the action of the group of contact diffeomorphisms on the space of CR structures on a compact, three dimensional manifold.
