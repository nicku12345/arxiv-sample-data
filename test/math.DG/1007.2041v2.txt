In this paper, we obtain the characterizations of Mannheim offsets of the timelike ruled surface with spacelike rulings in dual Lorentzian space. We give the relations between terms of their integral invariants and also we give the new characterization of the Mannheim offsets of developable timelike ruled surface. Moreover, we obtain the relationships between the area of projections of spherical images for Mannheim offsets of timelike ruled surfaces and their integral invariants.
