We study the geometrical structure of the coadjoint orbits of an arbitrary complex or real Lie algebra {\mathfrak g} containing some ideal {\mathfrak n}. It is shown that any coadjoint orbit in {\mathfrak g}^* is a bundle with the affine subspace of {\mathfrak g}^* as its fibre. This fibre is an isotropic submanifold of the orbit and is defined only by the coadjoint representations of the Lie algebras {\mathfrak g} and {\mathfrak n} on the dual space {\mathfrak n}^*. The use of this fact and an application of methods of symplectic geometry give a new insight into the structure of coadjoint orbits and allow us to generalize results derived earlier in the case when {\mathfrak g} is a split extension using the Abelian ideal {\mathfrak n} (a semidirect product). As applications, a new proof of the formula for the index of Lie algebra and a necessary condition of integrality of a coadjoint orbit are obtained.
