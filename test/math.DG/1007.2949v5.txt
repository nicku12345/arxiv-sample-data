The goal of the present paper is to calculate the limit spectrum of the Hodge-de Rham operator under the perturbation of collapsing one part of a manifold obtained by gluing together two manifolds with the same boundary. It appears to take place in the general problem of blowing up conical singularities as introduced in \cite{Maz} and \cite{Row1,Row2}.
