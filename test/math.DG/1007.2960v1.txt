The well known formulas express the curvature and the torsion of a curve in R^3 in terms of euclidean invariants of its derivatives. We obtain expressions of this kind for all curvatures of curves in R^n. It follows that a curve in R^n is determined up to an isometry by the norms of its n derivatives. We extend these observations to curves in arbitrary riemannian manifolds.
