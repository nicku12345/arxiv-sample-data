We prove that for any open Riemann surface N, natural number n\geq 3, non-constant harmonic map h:N\to \mathbb{R}^{n-2} and holomorphic 2-form H on N, there exists a weakly complete harmonic map X=(X_j)_{j=1,\ldots,n}:N \to \mathbb{R}^n with Hopf differential H and (X_j)_{j=3,\ldots,n}=h. In particular, there exists a complete conformal minimal immersion Y=(Y_j)_{j=1,\ldots,n}:N \to \mathbb{R}^n such that (Y_j)_{j=3,\ldots,n}=h.   As a consequence of these results, complete full non-decomposable minimal surfaces with arbitrary conformal structure and whose generalized Gauss map is non-degenerate and fails to intersect n hyperplanes of \mathbb{CP}^{n-1} in general position are constructed. Moreover, complete non-proper embedded minimal surfaces in \mathbb{R}^n, \forall n>3, are exhibited.
