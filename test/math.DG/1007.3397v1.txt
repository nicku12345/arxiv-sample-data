We show that Lorentzian manifolds whose isometry group is of dimension at least \frac{1}{2}n(n-1)+1 are expanding, steady and shrinking Ricci solitons and steady gradient Ricci solitons. This provides examples of complete locally conformally flat and symmetric Lorentzian Ricci solitons which are not rigid.
