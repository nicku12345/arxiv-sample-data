We study sequences f_k:\Sigma_k \to \R^n of conformally immersed, compact Riemann surfaces with fixed genus and Willmore energy {\cal W}(f) \leq \Lambda. Assume that \Sigma_k converges to \Sigma in moduli space, i.e. \phi_k^\ast(\Sigma_k) \to \Sigma as complex structures for diffeomorphisms \phi_k. Then we construct a branched conformal immersion f:\Sigma \to \R^n and M\"obius transformations \sigma_k, such that for a subsequence \sigma_k \circ f_k \circ \phi_k \to f weakly in W^{2,2}_{loc} away from finitely many points. For \Lambda < 8\pi the map f is unbranched. If the \Sigma_k diverge in moduli space, then we show \liminf_{k \to \infty} {\cal W}(f_k) \geq \min(8\pi,\omega^n_p). Our work generalizes results in \cite{K-S3} to arbitrary codimension.
