In this paper, we introduce a new concept so called harmonic complex structure by using harmonic theory for vector bundle-valued differential forms. It is a new structure intermediates between complex structure and K\"ahler structure. From differential geometric viewpoint, it is a natural generalization of K\"ahler structure.
