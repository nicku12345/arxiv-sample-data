We establish explicit formulae for canonical factorizations of extended solutions corresponding to harmonic maps of finite uniton number into the exceptional Lie group G_2 in terms of the Grassmannian model for the group of based algebraic loops in G_2. A description of the ``Frenet frame data" for such harmonic maps is given. In particular, we show that harmonic spheres into G_2 correspond to solutions of certain algebraic systems of quadratic and cubic equations.
