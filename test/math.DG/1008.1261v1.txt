Let G be a compact, simply connected Lie group. We develop a `quantization functor' from pre-quantized quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces at level k to the fusion ring (Verlinde algebra) R_k(G). The quantization Q(M) is defined as a push-forward in twisted equivariant K-homology. It may be computed by a fixed point formula, similar to the equivariant index theorem for Spin_c-Dirac operators. Using the formula, we calculate Q(M) in several examples.
