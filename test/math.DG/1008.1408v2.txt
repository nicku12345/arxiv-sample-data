We consider Ricci flow of complete Riemannian manifolds which have bounded non-negative curvature operator, non-zero asymptotic volume ratio and no boundary. We prove scale invariant estimates for these solutions. Using these estimates, we show that there is a limit solution, obtained by scaling down this solution at a fixed point in space. This limit solution is an expanding soliton coming out of the asymptotic cone at infinity.
