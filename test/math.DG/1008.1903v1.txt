Sasakian manifolds provide explicit formulae of some Jacobi operators which describe the biharmonic equation of curves in Riemannian manifolds. In this paper we characterize non-geodesic biharmonic curves in Sasakian manifolds which are either tangent or normal to the Reeb vector field. In the three-dimensional case, we prove that such curves are some helixes whose geodesic curvature and geodesic torsion satisfy a given relation.
