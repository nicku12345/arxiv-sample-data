In this paper we prove that for a complete, connected and oriented K\"{a}ler affine manifold (M,G) of dimension n, if it is K\"ahler affine Ricci flat or the K\ddot{a}hler affine scalar curvature S\equiv0, (n\leq 5), then the universal covering manifold \widetilde{M} of M is isometric to the Euclidean n-space E^{n}.
