We show how to associate with each graph with a certain property (positivity) a family of simply connected solvable Lie groups endowed with left-invariant Riemannian metrics that are Ricci solitons (called solsolitons). We classify them up to isometry, obtaining families depending on many parameters of explicit examples of Ricci solitons. A classification of graphs with up to 3 coherent components according to positivity is also given.
