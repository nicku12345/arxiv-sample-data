J.Eells and L. Lemaire introduced k-harmonic maps, and Wang Shaobo showed the first variation formula. In this paper, we give the second variation formula of k-energy, and give a notion of index, nullity and weakly stable. We also study k-harmonic maps into the product Riemannian manifold, and k-harmonic curves into a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature, and show their non-trivial solutions.
