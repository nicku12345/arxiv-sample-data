CMC-1 trinoids (i.e. constant mean curvature one immersed surface with three regular embedded ends) in hyperbolic 3-space H^3 are irreducible generically, and the irreducible ones have been classified. However, the reducible case has not yet been fully treated, so in this paper we give an explicit description of CMC-1 trinoids in H^3 that includes the reducible case.
