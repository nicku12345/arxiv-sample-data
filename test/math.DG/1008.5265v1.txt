In this article we study the sub-Riemannian geometry of the spheres S^{2n+1} and S^{4n+3}, arising from the principal S^1-bundle structure defined by the Hopf map and the principal S^3-bundle structure given by the quaternionic Hopf map respectively. The S^1 action leads to the classical contact geometry of S^{2n+1}, while the S^3 action gives another type of sub-Riemannian structure, with a distribution of corank 3. In both cases the metric is given as the restriction of the usual Riemannian metric on the respective horizontal distributions. For the contact S^7 case, we give an explicit form of the intrinsic sub-Laplacian and obtain a commutation relation between the sub-Riemannian heat operator and the heat operator in the vertical direction.
