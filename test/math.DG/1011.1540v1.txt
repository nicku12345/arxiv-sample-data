On a complete Riemannian manifold M with Ricci curvature satisfying \textrm{Ric}(\nabla r,\nabla r) \geq -Ar^2(\log r)^2(\log(\log r))^2...(\log^{k}r)^2 for r\gg 1, where A>0 is a constant, and r is the distance from an arbitrarily fixed point in M. we prove some Liouville-type theorems for a C^2 function f:M\rightarrow \Bbb R satisfying \Delta f\geq F(f) for a function F:\Bbb R\rightarrow \Bbb R.
