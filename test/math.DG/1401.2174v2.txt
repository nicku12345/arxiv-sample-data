In this paper we study a novel class of parabolic geometries which we call parabolic geometries of Monge type. These parabolic geometries are defined by special gradings of simple Lie algebras, namely, gradings with the property that their -1 component contains a nonzero co-dimension 1 abelian subspace whose bracket with its complement is non-degenerate. We completely classify the simple Lie algebras with such gradings in terms of elementary properties of the defining set of simple roots. We then characterize those parabolic geometries of Monge type which are non-rigid in the sense that, apart from the flat models, they have nonzero harmonic curvatures in positive weights. Standard models of all non-rigid parabolic geometries of Monge type are then described by under-determined ODE systems. The full symmetry algebras for these under-determined ODE systems are explicitly calculated; surprisingly, these symmetries are all just prolonged point symmetries.
