We study the first kind Abel differential equation \dfrac{dy}{dx}=c_0(x)+3c_1(x)y+3c_2y^2+c_3(x)y^3, where the functions c_i are real analytic. The first step of our analysis is through the Cartan equivalence method, then we use techniques from representation theory; this latter mean allows us to exhibit an affine connection and hence a covariant derivative on the space of differential invariants of the Abel equation. In the context of Abel equation, this affine connection is similar to the connection (also called Frobenius-Stickelberger connexion) given by the quasi-modular Eisenstein series E_2, which permits to define a covariant derivative in the space of modular forms and is a solution of a Chazy type equation.
