Roughly speaking, an ideal immersion of a Riemannian manifold into a real space form is an isometric immersion which produces the least possible amount of tension from the ambient space at each point of the submanifold. The main purpose of this paper is to completely classify all non-minimal ideal submanifolds of real space forms with type number \leq 2.
