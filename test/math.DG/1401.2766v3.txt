Let (M,g) be an open, oriented and incomplete riemannian manifold of dimension m. Under some general conditions we show that it is possible to build a Hilbert complex (L^2\Omega^i(M,g),d_{\mathfrak{M},i}) such that its cohomology groups, labeled with H^i_{2,\mathfrak{M}}(M,g), satisfy the following properties: \begin{itemize} \item H^i_{2,\mathfrak{M}}(M,g)=ker(d_{max,i})/\im(d_{min,i}) \item H^i_{2,\mathfrak{M}}(M,g)\cong H^{m-i}_{2,\mathfrak{M}}(M,g) (Poincar\'e duality holds) \end{itemize} Finally in the rest of the paper we study some properties of this complex with particular attention to the sufficient conditions which make it a Fredholm complex.
