In this paper we generalize the Local Removable Singularity Theorem in [16] for minimal laminations to the case of weak H-laminations (with H\in \mathbb{R} constant) in a punctured ball of a Riemannian three-manifold. We also obtain a curvature estimate for any weak CMC foliation (with possibly varying constant mean curvature from leaf to leaf) of a compact Riemannian three-manifold N with boundary solely in terms of a bound of the absolute sectional curvature of N and of the distance to the boundary of N. We then apply these results to classify weak CMC foliations of \mathbb{R}^3 and \mathbb{S}^3 with a closed countable set of singularities.
