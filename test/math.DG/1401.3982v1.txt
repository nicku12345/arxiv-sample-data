In this paper we characterise with the matrix the complete flag of riemannian extension (see d\'efinition) on a riemannian compact manifold whose metric is bundlelike for any foliation F_{s} of this flag. This study show us that a foliation of a complete flag of riemannian extension on a riemannian compact manifold whose metric is bundlelike for any foliation of this flag is a transversely diagonal riemannian foliation (see d\'efinition).
