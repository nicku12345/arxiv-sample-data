In this paper, we define the notion of eikonal helix and eikonal slant helix for null curves in the 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold M 1 4 and give a characterization for the null curve to be the null eikonal helix. Moreover, we indicate an important relation between the null eikonal helix and null eikonal slant helix and find the axis of the null eikonal helix. We obtain some relationships between the curvatures of these curves.
