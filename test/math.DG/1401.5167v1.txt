Let M be an n-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature \ge n-1. In \cite{colding1, colding2}, Tobias Colding, by developing some new techniques, proved that the following three condtions: 1) d_{GH}(M, S^n)\to 0; 2) the volume of M {\text{Vol}}(M)\to{\text{Vol}}(S^n); 3) the radius of M {\text{rad}}(M)\to\pi are equivalent. In \cite{peter}, Peter Petersen, by developing a different technique, gave the 4-th equivalent condition, namely he proved that the n+1-th eigenvalue of M \lambda_{n+1}(M)\to n is also equivalent to the radius of M {\text{rad}}(M)\to\pi, and hence the other two. In this note, we give a new proof of Petersen's theorem by utilizing Colding's techniques.
