This is a corrected version of my paper "Application of integral geometry to minimal surfaces" appeared in International J. Math. vol. 4 Nr. 1 (1993), 89-111. The correction concerns Proposition 3.5. We discuss this correction in Appendix to the original version of my published paper by reproducing our correspondence with Professor Tasaki.
