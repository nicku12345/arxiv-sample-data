Adjusting conventional Chern-Simons theory to {\rm G}_2-manifolds, one describes {\rm G}_2-instantons on bundles over a certain class of 7-dimensional flat tori which fiber non-trivially over T^4, by a pullback argument. Moreover, if c_2\neq0, any (generic) deformation of the {\rm G}_2-structure away from such a fibred structure causes all instantons to vanish. A brief investigation in the general context of (conformally compatible) associative fibrations f:Y^7\to X^4 relates {\rm G}_2-instantons on pullback bundles f^*E\to Y and self-dual connections on the bundle E\to X over the base, a fact which may be of independent interest.
