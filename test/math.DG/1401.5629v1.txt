The notion of generalized almost paracontact structure on the generalized tangent bundle TM\oplus T^*M is introduced and its properties are investigated. The case when the manifold M carries an almost paracontact metric structure is also discussed. Conditions for its transformed under a \beta- or a B-field transformation to be also a generalized almost paracontact structure are given. Finally, the normality of a generalized almost paracontact structure is defined and a characterization of a normal generalized almost paracontact structure induced by an almost paracontact one is given.
