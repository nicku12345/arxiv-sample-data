We find a remarkable family of \mathrm{G}_2 structures defined on certain principal \mathrm{SO}(3)-bundles P_\pm\longrightarrow M associated with any given oriented Riemannian 4-manifold M. Such structures are always cocalibrated. The study starts with a recast of the Singer-Thorpe equations of 4-dimensional geometry. These are applied to the Bryant-Salamon cons\-truction of complete \mathrm{G}_2-holonomy metrics on the vector bundle of self- or anti-self-dual 2-forms on M. We then discover new examples of that special holonomy on disk bundles over {\cal H}^4 and {\cal H}^2_{\mathbb{C}}, respectively, the real and complex hyperbolic space. Only in the end we present the new \mathrm{G}_2 structures on principal bundles.
