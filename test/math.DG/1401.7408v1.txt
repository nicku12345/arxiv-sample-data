Let S^n(X) be the n-fold symmetric product of a compact connected Riemann surface X of genus g and gonality d. We prove that S^n(X) admits a K\"ahler structure such that all the holomorphic bisectional curvatures are nonpositive if and only if n < d. Let {\mathcal Q}_X(r,n) be the Quot scheme parametrizing the torsion quotients of {\mathcal O}^{\oplus r}_X of degree n. If g \geq 2 and n \leq 2g-2, we prove that {\mathcal Q}_X(r,n) does not admit a K\"ahler structure such that all the holomorphic bisectional curvatures are nonnegative.
