We show the existence of a weak bi-invariant symmetric nondegenerate 2-form on the volume-preserving diffeomorphism group of a three-dimensional manifold and study its properties. Despite the fact that the space \mathcal{D}_\mu(M^3) is infinite-dimensional, we succeed in defining the signature of the bi-invariant quadric form. It is equal to the \eta-invariant of the manifold M^3.
