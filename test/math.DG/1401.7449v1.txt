We consider conformal immersions f: T^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 with the property that H^2 f^*g_{\mathbb{R}^3} is a flat metric. These so called Dirac tori have the property that its Willmore energy is uniformly distributed over the surface and can be obtained using spin transformations of the plane by eigenvectors of the standard Dirac operator for a fixed eigenvalue. We classify Dirac tori and determine the conformal classes realized by them. We want to note that the spinors of Dirac tori satisfies the same system of PDE's as the differential of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian tori in \mathbb{R}^4. These were classified in [5] .
