We introduce pseudoconformal structures on 4--dimensional manifolds and study their properties. Such structures are arising from two different complex operators which agree in a 2--dimensional subbundle of the tangent bundle; this subbundle thus forms a codimension 2 {\rm CR} structure. A special case is that of a strictly pseudoconformal structure: in this case, the two complex operators are also opposite in a 2-dimensional subbundle which is complementary to the {\rm CR} structure. A non trivial example of a manifold endowed with a (strictly) pseudoconformal structure is Falbel's cross--ratio variety \mathfrak{X}; this variety is isomorphic to the {\rm PU}(2,1) configuration space of quadruples of pairwise distinct points in S^3. We first prove that there are two complex structures that appear naturally in \mathfrak{X}; these give \mathfrak{X} a pseudoconformal structure which coincides with its well known {\rm CR} structure. Using a non trivial involution of \mathfrak{X} we then prove that \mathfrak{X} is a strictly pseudoconformal manifold. The geometric meaning of this involution as well as its interconnections with the \rm{CR} and complex structures of \mathfrak{X} are also studied here in detail.
