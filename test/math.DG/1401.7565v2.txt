One of the main methods of constructing new spaces with positive or almost positive curvature is the study of biquotients first studied in detail by Eschenburg. We classify orbifold biquotients of the Lie Group SU(3), and construct a new example of a 5-dimensional orbifold with almost positive curvature. Furthermore, we extend the work of Florit and Ziller on the geometric properties of the orbifolds SU(3)//T^2.
