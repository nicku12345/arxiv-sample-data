A Lie algebra structure on variation vector fields along an immersed curve in a 2-dimensional real space form is investigated. This Lie algebra particularized to plane curves is the cornerstone in order to define a Hamiltonian structure for plane curve motions. The Hamiltonian form and the integrability of the planar filament equation is finally discussed from this point of view.
