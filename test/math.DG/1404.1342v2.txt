We introduce Dolbeault cohomology valued characteristic classes of Higgs bundles over complex manifolds. Flat vector bundles have characteristic classes lying in odd degree de Rham cohomology and a theorem of Reznikov says that these must vanish in degrees three and higher over compact K\"ahler manifolds. We provide a simple and independent proof of Reznikov's result and show that our characteristic classes of Higgs bundles and the characteristic classes of flat vector bundles are compatible via the nonabelian Hodge theorem.
