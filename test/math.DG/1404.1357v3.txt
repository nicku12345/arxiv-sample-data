We describe the compact Lorentzian 3-manifolds admitting a parallel lightlike vector field. The classification of compact Lorentzian 3-manifolds admitting non-isometric affine diffeomorphisms follows, together with the complete description of these morphisms. Such a Lorentzian manifold is in some sense an equivariant deformation of a flat one.
