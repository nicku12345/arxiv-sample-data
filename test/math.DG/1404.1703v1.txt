The aim of this paper is to determine criteria of being integral curve for the geodesic spray of the natural lift curves of the spherical indicatrices of the involutes of a given spacelike curve with a timelike binormal in Minkowski 3-space. Furthermore, some interesting results about the spacelike evolute curve with timelike binormal and spacelike or timelike Darboux vector were obtained, depending on the assumption that the natural lift curves of the spherical indicatrices of the involute curve should be the integral curve on the tangent bundle. Additionally we illustrate an example of our main results.
