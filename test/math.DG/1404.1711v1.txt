We consider hypersurfaces in the real Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n+1} (n\geq2) which are relatively normalized. We give necessary and sufficient conditions a) for a surface of negative Gaussian curvature in \mathbb{R}^3 to be ruled, b) for a hypersurface of positive Gaussian curvature in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} to be a hyperquadric and c) for a relative normalization to be constantly proportional to the equiaffine normalization.
