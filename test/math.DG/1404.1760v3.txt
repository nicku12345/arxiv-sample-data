Consider a transitive action of a Lie group G on a (real analytic) manifold M of dimension m, and two (embedded) submanifolds A and B in M of sufficiently large class and of dimension k and l, respectively. We prove that, for a generic \sigma \in G, the intersection \sigma (A) \cap B is transversal, whence a submanifold of dimension k+l-m or the empty set. This paper is a continuation of our previous article, devoted to definable transitive actions of definable groups on manifolds and generic intersections in an o-minimal structure, and inspired by a question of Jan Mycielski about the intersections of translates of analytic sets in the real plane.
