The classical inverse problem of recovering a simply connected smooth planar domain from the Steklov spectrum \cite{E} is equivalent to the problem of recovering, up to a conformal equivalence, a positive function a\in C^\infty({\mathbb S}) on the unit circle {\mathbb S}=\{e^{i\theta}\} from the eigenvalue spectrum of the operator a\Lambda_e, where \Lambda_e=(-d^2/d\theta^2)^{1/2}. We introduce 2k-forms Z_k(a)\ (k=1,2,\dots) in Fourier coefficients of the function a which are called zeta-invariants. They are uniquely determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of a\Lambda_e. We study some properties of Z_k(a), in particular, their invariance under the conformal group. Some open questions on zeta-invariants are posed at the end of the paper.
