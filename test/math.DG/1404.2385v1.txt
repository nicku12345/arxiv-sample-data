We study anti-holomorphic semi-invariant submersions from K\"{a}hlerian manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds. We prove that all distributions which are involved in the definition of the submersion are integrable. We also prove that the O'Neill's tensor \mathcal{T} vanishes on the invariant vertical distribution. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for totally geodesicness and harmonicity of this type submersions. Moreover, we investigate the several curvatures of the total manifold and fibers and give a characterization theorem.
