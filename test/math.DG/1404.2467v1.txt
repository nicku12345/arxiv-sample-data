For a given minimal Legendrian submanifold L of a Sasaki-Einstein manifold we construct two families of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian of L and we give a lower bound for the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace. Moreover, in the case the lower bound is attained, we prove that L is totally geodesic and a rigidity result about the ambient manifold. This is a generalization of a result for the standard Sasakian sphere done by L\^e and Wang.
