See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izbGXdjvK_I for a YouTube video showing part of the results in this paper.We will consider surfaces whose mean curvature at a point is a linear function of the square of the distance from that point to the vertical axis. We restrict ourselves here to surfaces which are cylinders over a curve in a horizontal plane. We describe the moduli space of the set of solutions which includes numerous properly immersed and embedded examples. We also analyze the stability of these cylindrical surfaces.
