In this paper, it is proved that any conformal vector field is homothetic on a locally projectively flat (\alpha,\beta)-space of non-Randers type in dimension n\ge 3, and the local solutions of such a vector field are determined. While on a locally projectively flat Randers space, examples showthat the conformal vector fields are not necessarily homothetic.
