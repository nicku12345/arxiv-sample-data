n this paper, we obtain a geometric inequality between the length of the second fundamental form and the length of Lee form in terms of the warping function for a CR-warped product submanifold in a locally conformal Kaehler space form. The equality case is also investigated. Furthermore, the inequality is discussed for the important subclass of locally conformal Kaehler manifolds i.e., Vaisman manifold.
