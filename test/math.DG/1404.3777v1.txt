We derive general structure and rigidity theorems for submetries f: M \to X, where M is a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature \sec M \ge 1. When applied to a non-trivial Riemannian submersion, it follows that diam X \leq \pi/2 . In case of equality, there is a Riemannian submersion \mathbb{S} \to M from a unit sphere, and as a consequence, f is known up to metric congruence. A similar rigidity theorem also holds in the general context of Riemannian foliations.
