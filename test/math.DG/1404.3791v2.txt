The purpose of this paper is to classify totally umbilical slant submanifolds of a Kenmotsu manifold. We prove that a totally umbilical slant submanifold M of a Kenmotsu manifold \bar M is either invariant or anti-invariant or dim M=1 or the mean curvature vector H of M lies in the invariant normal subbundle. Moreover, we find with an example that every totally umbilical proper slant submanifold is totally geodesic.
