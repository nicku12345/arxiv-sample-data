In this paper we establish an analogue of the classical Lichnerowicz' theorem giving a sharp lower bound of the first non-zero eigenvalue of the sub-Laplacian on a compact seven-dimensional quaternionic contact manifold, assuming a lower bound of the qc-Ricci tensor, torsion tensor and its distinguished covariant derivatives.
