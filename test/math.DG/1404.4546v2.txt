Every almost Hermitian structure (g,J) on a four-manifold M determines a hypersurface \Sigma_J in the (positive) twistor space of (M,g) consisting of the complex structures anti-commuting with J. In this note we find the conditions under which \Sigma_J is minimal with respect to a natural Riemannian metric on the twistor space in the cases when J is integrable or symplectic. Several examples illustrating the obtained results are also discussed.
