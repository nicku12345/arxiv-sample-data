In Lorentzian geometry, limited definition of angles restricts the use of angle bisectors in study of triangles. This paper redefines angle bisectors so that they can be used to study attributes of triangles. Using the new definition, this paper investigates the existence of the incenter and the isogonal conjugate of a triangle in Lorentzian plane.
