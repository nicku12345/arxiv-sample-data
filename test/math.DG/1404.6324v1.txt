In this paper, we discuss the Finsler spaces (M^n,L) and (M^n,\,^{*}L), where ^{*}L(x,y) is obtained from L(x,y) by Kropina change ^{*}L(x,y)=\frac{L^2(x,y)}{b_i(x,y)\,y^i} and b^{}_{i}(x,y) is an h-vector in (M^n,L). We find the necessary and sufficient condition when the Cartan connection coefficients for both spaces (M^n,L) and (M^n,\,^{*}L) are the same. We also find the necessary and sufficient condition for Kropina change with an h-vector to be projective.
