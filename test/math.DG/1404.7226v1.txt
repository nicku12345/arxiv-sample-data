In this paper, we study warped product submanifolds of nearly trans-Sasakian manifolds. The non-existence of the warped product semi-slant submanifolds of the type N_\theta\times{_{f}N_T} is shown, whereas some characterization and new geometric obstructions are obtained for the warped products of the type N_T\times{_{f}N_\theta}. We establish two general inequalities for the squared norm of the second fundamental form. The first inequality generalizes derived inequalities for some contact metric manifolds [16, 18, 19, 24], while by a new technique, the second inequality is constructed to express the relation between extrinsic invariant (second fundamental form) and intrinsic invariant (scalar curvatures). The equality cases are also discussed.
