In this paper, we study semi-slant submanifolds and their warped products in Kenmotsu manifolds. The existence of such warped products in Kenmotsu manifolds is shown by an example and a characterization. A sharp relation is obtained as a lower bound of the squared norm of second fundamental form in terms of the warping function and the slant angle. The equality case is also considered in this paper. Finally, we provide some applications of our derived results.
