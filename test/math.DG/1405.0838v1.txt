We study generalized Killing spinors on the standard sphere \mathbb{S}^3, which turn out to be related to Lagrangian embeddings in the nearly K\"ahler manifold S^3\times S^3 and to great circle flows on \mathbb{S}^3. Using our methods we generalize a well known result of Gluck and Gu concerning divergence-free geodesic vector fields on the sphere and we show that the space of Lagrangian submanifolds of S^3\times S^3 has at least three connected components.
