We study the geodesic equation for the Dirichlet (gradient) metric in the space of Kaehler potentials. We first solve the initial value problem for the geodesic equation of the combination metric, including the gradient metric. We then discuss a comparison theorem between it and the Calabi metric.   As geometric motivation of the combination metric, we find that the Ebin metric restricted to the space of type II deformations of a Sasakian structure is the sum of the Calabi metric and the gradient metric.
