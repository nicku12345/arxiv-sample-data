This paper extends, in a sharp way, the famous Efimov's Theorem to immersed ends in \real^3. More precisely, let M be a non-compact connected surface with compact boundary. Then there is no complete isometric immersion of M into \Bbb R^3 satisfying that \int_M |K|=+\infty and K\le-\kappa<0, where \kappa is a positive constant and K is the Gaussian curvature of M. In particular Efimov's Theorem holds for complete Hadamard immersed surfaces, whose Gaussian curvature K is bounded away from zero outside a compact set.
