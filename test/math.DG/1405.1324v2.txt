We prove there exists a compact embedded minimal surface in a complete finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold \mathcal{N}. We also obtain a least area, incompressible, properly embedded, finite topology, 2-sided surface. We prove a properly embedded minimal surface of bounded curvature has finite topology. This determines its asymptotic behavior. Some rigidity theorems are obtained.
