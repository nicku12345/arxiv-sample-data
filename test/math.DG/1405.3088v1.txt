The space of the structure (0,3)-tensors of the covariant derivatives of the structure endomorphism and the metric on almost contact B-metric manifolds is considered. A known decomposition of this space in orthogonal and invariant subspaces with respect to the action of the structure group is used. We determine the corresponding components of the structure tensor and consider the case of the lowest dimension 3 of the studied manifolds. Some examples are commented.
