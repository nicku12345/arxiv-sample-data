In this work we prove the existence of embedded closed minimal hypersurfaces in non-compact manifolds containing a bounded open subset with smooth and strictly mean-concave boundary and a natural behavior on the geometry at infinity. For doing this, we develop a modified min-max theory for the area functional following Almgren and Pitts' setting, to produce minimal surfaces with intersecting properties.
