We classify minimal hypersurfaces in R^n \times S^m, n,m \geq 2, which are invariant by the canonical action of O(n) \times O(m). We also construct compact and noncompact examples of invariant hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature. We show that the minimal hypersurfaces and the noncompact constant mean curvature hypersurfaces are all unstable.
