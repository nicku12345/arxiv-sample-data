In this article, we will formulate a mathematical framework that allows us to treat character animations as points on infinite dimensional Hilbert manifolds. Constructing geodesic paths between animations on those manifolds allows us to derive a distance function to measure similarities of different motions. This approach is derived from the field of geometric shape analysis, where such formalisms have been used to facilitate object recognition tasks.   Analogously to the idea of shape spaces, we construct motion spaces consisting of equivalence classes of animations under reparametrizations. Especially cyclic motions can be represented elegantly in this framework.   We demonstrate the suitability of this approach in multiple applications in the field of computer animation. First, we show how visual artifacts in cyclic animations can be removed by applying a computationally efficient manifold projection method. We next highlight how geodesic paths can be used to calculate interpolations between various animations in a computationally stable way. Finally, we show how the same mathematical framework can be used to perform cluster analysis on large motion capture databases, which can be used for or as part of motion retrieval problems.
