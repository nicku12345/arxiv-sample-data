We study \lambda-hypersurfaces that are critical points of a Gaussian weighted area functional \int_{\Sigma} e^{-\frac{|x|^2}{4}}dA for compact variations that preserve weighted volume. First, we prove various gap and rigidity theorems for complete \lambda-hypersurfaces in terms of the norm of the second fundamental form |A|. Second, we show that in one dimension, the only smooth complete and embedded \lambda-hypersurfaces in \mathbb{R}^2 with \lambda\geq 0 are lines and round circles. Moreover, we establish a Bernstein type theorem for \lambda-hypersurfaces which states that smooth \lambda-hypersurfaces that are entire graphs with polynomial volume growth are hyperplanes. All the results can be viewed as generalizations of results for self-shrinkers.
