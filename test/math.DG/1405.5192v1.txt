In this paper we prove two sharp inequalities involving the normalized scalar curvature and the generalized normalized \delta-Casorati curvatures for slant submanifolds in quaternionic space forms. We also characterize those submanifolds for which the equality cases hold. These results are a generalization of some recent results concerning the Casorati curvature for a slant submanifold in a quaternionic space form obtained by Slesar et al.: J. Inequal. Appl. 2014, 2014:123.
