Let \Sigma be a compact immersed stable capillary hypersurface in a wedge bounded by two hyperplanes in \mathbb R^{n+1}. Suppose that \Sigma meets those two hyperplanes in constant contact angles and is disjoint from the edge of the wedge. It is proved that if \partial \Sigma is embedded for n=2, or if \partial\Sigma is convex for n\geq3, then \Sigma is part of the sphere. And the same is true for \Sigma in the half-space of \mathbb R^{n+1} with connected boundary \partial\Sigma.
