We consider a complete biharmonic submanifold \phi:(M,g)\rightarrow (N,h) in a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above by a non-negative constant c. Assume that the mean curvature is bounded from below by \sqrt c. If (i) \int_M (|{\bf H}|^2-c)^{p}dv_g<\infty, for some 0<p<\infty, or (ii) the Ricci curvature of M is bounded from below, then the mean curvature is \sqrt c. Furthermore, if M is compact, then we obtain the same result without the assumption (i) or (ii).
