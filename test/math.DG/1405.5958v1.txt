The classification of isoparametric hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures in the sphere interplays in a deep fashion with commutative algebra, whose abstract and comprehensive nature might obscure a differential geometer's insight into the classification problem that encompasses a wide spectrum of geometry and topology. In this paper, we make an effort to bridge the gap by walking through the important part of commutative algebra central to the classification of such hypersurfaces, such that all the essential ideal-theoretic ingredients are laid out in a way as much intuitive, motivating and geometric with rigor maintained as possible. We then explain how we developed the technical side of the entailed ideal theory, pertinent to isoparametric hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures, for the classification done in our papers~\cite{CCJ},~\cite{Ch1} and~\cite{Ch3}.
