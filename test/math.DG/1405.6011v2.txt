We develop variation formulas for the quantities of extrinsic geometry for adapted variations of metrics on almost-product (e.g. foliated) Riemannian manifolds, and apply them to study the total mixed scalar curvature of a distribution -- analogue of the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. The mixed scalar curvature {\rm S}_{\,\rm mix} is the averaged sectional curvature over all planes that contain vectors from both distributions of an almost-product structure and the variations we consider preserve orthogonality of the distributions. We derive the directional derivative D J_{\,\rm mix} (of the total {\rm S}_{\,\rm mix}) for adapted variations of metrics on closed almost-product manifolds and foliations of arbitrary dimension. The obtained Euler-Lagrange equations are presented in two equiva\-lent forms: in terms of extrinsic geometry and intrinsically using the partial Ricci tensor. Certainly, these mixed field equations admit amount of solutions (e.g., twisted products).
