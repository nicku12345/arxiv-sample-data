We study the isotropy representation of real flag manifolds associated to simple Lie algebras that are split real forms of complex simple Lie algebras. For each Dynkin diagram the invariant irreducible subspaces for the compact part of the isotropy subgroup are described. Contrary to the complex flag manifolds the decomposition into irreducible components is not in general unique, since there are cases with infinitely many invariant subspaces.
