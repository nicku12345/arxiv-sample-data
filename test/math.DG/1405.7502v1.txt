We show the existence of a deformation process of hypersurfaces from a product space M_1\times R into another product space M_2\times R such that the relation of the principal curvatures of the deformed hypersurfaces can be controlled in terms of the sectional curvatures or Ricci curvatures of M_1 and M_2. In this way, we obtain barriers which are used for proving existence or non existence of hypersurfaces with prescribed curvatures in a general product space M\times R.
