Let M be an 8-manifold with a Spin(7)-structure. We first show that closed Cayley submanifolds of M form a smooth moduli space for a generic Spin(7)-structure. Then we study the deformations of a compact, connected Cayley submanifold X of M with non-empty boundary contained in a given submanifold W of M such that X and W meet orthogonally. We show that they are rigid for a generic Spin(7)-structure. We further show that they are also rigid for a generic deformation of W.
