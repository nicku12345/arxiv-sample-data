We define the quantum correction of the Teichm\"uller space \mathcal{T} of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Under the assumption of no weak quantum correction, we prove that the Teichm\"uller space \mathcal{T} is a locally symmetric space with the Weil-Petersson metric. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we show that no strong quantum correction is equivalent to that, with the Hodge metric, the image  \Phi(\mathcal{T}) of the Teichm\"uller space \mathcal{T} under the period map \Phi is an open submanifold of a globally Hermitian symmetric space W of the same dimension as \mathcal{T}. Finally, for Hyperk\"ahler manifold of dimension 2n \geq 4, we find both locally and globally defined families of (2,0) and (2n,0)-classes over the Teichm\"uller space of polarized Hyperk\"ahler manifolds.
