We study deformations of free boundary constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces whose Jacobi operator is degenerate due to symmetries of the ambient space. The value of the mean curvature and the ambient metric are allowed to vary simultaneously, provided that the infinitesimal ambient symmetries change smoothly. We discuss applications to free boundary CMC disks and Delaunay annuli in the unit ball of a space form.
