We study non-flat planar 3-webs with infinitesimal symmetries. Using multi-dimensional Schwarzian derivative we give a criterion for linearization of such webs and present a projective classification thereof. Using this classification we show that the Gronwall conjecture is true for 3-webs admitting infinitesimal symmetries.
