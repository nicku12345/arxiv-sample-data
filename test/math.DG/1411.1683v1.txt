We propose a method to extend submanifolds, singular Riemannian foliations and isometric actions from a boundary component of a noncompact symmetric space to the whole space. This extension method preserves minimal submanifolds, isoparametric foliations and polar actions, among other properties. One of the several applications yields the first examples of inhomogeneous isoparametric hypersurfaces in noncompact symmetric spaces of rank at least two.
