More than forty years ago J. H. Samson has defined the Laplacian \Delta_{sym} acting on the space of symmetric covariant p-tensors on an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g). This operator is an analogue of the well known Hodge-de Rham Laplacian \Delta which acts on the space of exterior differential p-forms (1 \le p \le n) on (M, g). In the present paper we will prove that for n > p = 1 the operator \Delta_{sym} is the Yano rough Laplacian and show its spectrum properties on a compact Riemannian manifold.
