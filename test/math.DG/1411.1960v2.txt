We give new counterexamples to a question of Karsten Grove, whether there are only finitely many rational homotopy types among simply connected manifolds satisfying the assumptions of Gromov's Betti number theorem. Our counterexamples are homogeneous Riemannian manifolds, in contrast to previous ones. They consist of two families in dimensions 13 and 22. Both families are nonnegatively curved with an additional upper curvature bound and differ already by the ring structure of their cohomology rings with complex coefficients. The 22-dimensional examples also admit almost nonnegative curvature operator with respect to homogeneous metrics.
