We study the Gauss map G of surfaces of revolution in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space {\mathbb{E}^3} with respect to the so called Cheng-Yau operator \square acting on the functions defined on the surfaces. As a result, we establish the classification theorem that the only surfaces of revolution with Gauss map G satisfying \square G=AG for some 3\times3 matrix A are the planes, right circular cones, circular cylinders and spheres.
