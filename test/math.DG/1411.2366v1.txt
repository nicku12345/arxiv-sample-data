We first investigate the asymptotics of conical expanding gradient Ricci solitons by proving sharp decay rates to the asymptotic cone both in the generic and the asymptotically Ricci flat case. We then establish a compactness theorem concerning nonnegatively curved expanding gradient Ricci solitons.
