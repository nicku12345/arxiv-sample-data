Let P be a Delzant polytope. We show that the quantization of the corresponding toric manifold X_{P} in toric K\"ahler polarizations and in the toric real polarization are related by analytic continuation of Hamiltonian flows evaluated at time t = \sqrt{-1} s. We relate the quantization of X_{P} in two different toric K\"ahler polarizations by taking the time-\sqrt{-1} s Hamiltonian "flow" of strongly convex functions on the moment polytope P. By taking s to infinity, we obtain the quantization of X_{P} in the (singular) real toric polarization.   Recall that X_{P} has an open dense subset which is biholomorphic to ({\mathbb{C}}^{*})^{n}. The quantization of X_{P} in a toric K\"ahler polarization can also be described by applying the complexified Hamiltonian flow of the Abreu--Guillemin symplectic potential g, at time t=\sqrt{-1}, to an appropriate finite-dimensional subspace of quantum states in the quantization of T^{*}{\mathbb{T}}^{n} in the vertical polarization. By taking other imaginary times, t= k \sqrt{-1}, k\in {\mathbb{R}}, we describe toric K\"ahler metrics with cone singularities along the toric divisors in X_{P}.   For convex Hamiltonian functions and sufficiently negative imaginary part of the complex time, we obtain degenerate K\"ahler structures which are negative definite in some regions of X_{P}. We show that the pointwise and L^2-norms of quantum states are asymptotically vanishing on negative-definite regions.
