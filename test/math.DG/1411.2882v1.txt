Let G be a connected reductive complex affine algebraic group and K\subset G a maximal compact subgroup. Let M be a compact complex torus equipped with a flat K\"ahler structure and (E_G ,\theta) a polystable Higgs G-bundle on M. Take any C^\infty reduction of structure group E_K \subset E_G to the subgroup K that solves the Yang--Mills equation for (E_G ,\theta). We prove that the principal G-bundle E_G is polystable and the above reduction E_K solves the Einstein--Hermitian equation for E_G. We also prove that for a semistable (respectively, polystable) Higgs G-bundle (E_G , \theta) on a compact connected Calabi--Yau manifold, the underlying principal G-bundle E_G is semistable (respectively, polystable).
