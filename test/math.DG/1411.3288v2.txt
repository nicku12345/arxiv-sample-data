We consider Legendrian contact structures on odd-dimensional complex analytic manifolds. We are particularly interested in integrable structures, which can be encoded by compatible complete systems of second order PDEs on a scalar function of many independent variables and considered up to point transformations. Using the techniques of parabolic differential geometry, we compute the associated regular, normal Cartan connection and give explicit formulas for the harmonic part of the curvature. The PDE system is trivializable by means of point transformations if and only if the harmonic curvature vanishes identically.   In dimension five, the harmonic curvature takes the form of a binary quartic field, so there is a Petrov classification based on its root type. We give a complete local classification of all five-dimensional integrable Legendrian contact structures whose symmetry algebra is transitive on the manifold and has at least one-dimensional isotropy algebra at any point.
