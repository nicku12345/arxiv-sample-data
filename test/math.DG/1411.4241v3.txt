We study stable immersed capillary hypersurfaces in a domain \mathcal B which is either a half-space or a slab in the Euclidean space \Bbb R^{n+1}. We prove that such a hypersurface \Sigma is rotationally symmetric in the following cases:   (1) n=2, \mathcal B is a slab and \Sigma has genus zero,   (2) n\geq 2, \mathcal B is a slab, the angle of contact is \pi/2 and each component of \partial\Sigma is embedded,   (3) n\geq 2, \mathcal B is a half-space, the angle of contact is <\pi/2 and each component of \partial\Sigma is embedded.   Moreover, in case (2), if not a right circular cylinder, the hypersurface has to be graphical over a domain in \partial\mathcal B. In case (3), the hypersurface is a spherical cap.
