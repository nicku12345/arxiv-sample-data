We describe a semi-local canonical form for Legendrian foliations on contact manifolds in the neighbourhood of a Legendrian submanifold. This result generalizes local results by Libermann and Pang on Legendrian foliations on contact manifolds, and is analogeous to a semi-local result by Weinstein in the symplectic case. For the proof, we introduce and use a class of cohomology that obstructs the possibility to make a Legendrian foliation flat.
