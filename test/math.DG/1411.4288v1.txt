Let us fix two different radial eigenfunctions of a hyperbolic Laplacian and assume that both of them have the same value at the origin. Both eigenvalues can be complex numbers. The main goal of this paper is to estimate the lower bound for the interval (0,T], where these two eigenfunctions must assume different values at every point. We shall see that T is a function of two different eigenvalues corresponding to the given pair of radial eigenfunctions. On the other hand, we shall see that at every fixed point and for the value already assumed by a radial eigenfunction at the fixed point, there are infinitely many other radial eigenfunctions, assuming the same value at the fixed point and satisfying the same initial condition.
