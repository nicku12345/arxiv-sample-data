A conformal structure on a manifold M^n induces natural second order conformally invariant operators, called M\"obius and Laplace structures, acting on specific weight bundles of M, provided that n\ge 3. By extending the notions of M\"obius and Laplace structures to the case of surfaces and curves, we develop here the theory of extrinsic conformal geometry for submanifolds, find tensorial invariants of a conformal embedding, and use these invariants to characterize various forms of geodesic submanifolds.
