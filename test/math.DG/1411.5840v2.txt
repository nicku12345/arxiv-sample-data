The squashed 7-sphere S^{7} is a 7-sphere with an Einstein metric given by the canonical variation and its cone \mathbb{R}^{8} - \{ 0 \} has full holonomy {\rm Spin}(7). There is a canonical calibrating 4-form \Phi on \mathbb{R}^{8} - \{ 0 \}. A minimal 3-submanifold in S^{7} is called associative if its cone is calibrated by \Phi. In this paper, we classify two types of fundamental associative submanifolds in the squashed S^{7}. One is obtained by the intersection with a 4-plane and the other is homogeneous. Then we study their infinitesimal associative deformations and explicitly show that all of them are integrable.
