The present article provides a study of 2-Killing vector fields on warped product manifolds as well as characterization of this structure on standard static and generalized Robertson-Walker space-times. Some conditions for a 2-Killing vector field on a warped product manifold to be parallel are obtained. Moreover, some results on the curvature of a warped product manifolds in terms of 2-Killing vector fields are derived. Finally, we apply our results to describe 2-Killing vector fields of some well known warped product space-time models.
