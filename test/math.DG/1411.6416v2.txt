We introduce the concept {\it h-almost Ricci soliton} which extends naturally the {\it almost Ricci soliton} by Pigola-Rigoli-Rimoldi-Setti and show that a compact nontrivial h-almost Ricci soliton of dimension no less than three with h having defined signal and constant scalar curvature is isometric to a standard sphere with the potential function well determined. We also consider the {\it h-Ricci soliton} which is a particular case of the h-almost Ricci soliton and a generalization of the {\it Ricci soliton} and give characterizations for a special class of gradient h-Ricci solitons.
