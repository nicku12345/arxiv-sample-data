A world sheet in Lorentz-Minkowski space is a timelike submanifold consisting of a one-parameter family of spacelike submanifolds in Lorentz-Minkowski space. In this paper we investigate differential geometry of world sheets in Lorentz-Minkowski space as an application of the theory of big wave fronts.
