It is well known that the cohomology groups of a closed manifold M can be reconstructed using the gradient dynamical of a Morse-Smale function f\colon M\to \R. A direct result of this construction are Morse inequalities that provide lower bounds for the number of critical points of f in term of Betti numbers of M. These inequalities can be deduced through a purely analytic method by studying the asymptotic behaviour of the deformed Laplacian operator. This method was introduced by E. Witten and has inspired a numbers of great achievements in Geometry and Topology in few past decades. In this paper, adopting the Witten approach, we provide an analytic proof for; the so called; equivariant Morse inequalities when the underlying manifold is acted on by the Lie group G=S^1 and the Morse function f is invariant with respect to this action.
