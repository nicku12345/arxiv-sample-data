For a convex body on the Euclidean unit sphere the spherical convex floating body is introduced. The asymptotic behavior of the volume difference of a spherical convex body and its spherical floating body is investigated. This gives rise to a new spherical area measure, the floating area. Remarkably, this floating area turns out to be a spherical analogue to the classical affine surface area from affine differential geometry. Several properties of the floating area are established.
