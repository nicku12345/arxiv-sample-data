On a compact stratified space (X, g) there exists a metric of constant scalar curvature in the conformal class of g, if the scalar curvature satisfies an integrability condition and if the Yamabe constant of X is strictly smaller than the local Yamabe constant , another conformal invariant introduced in the recent work of K. Akutagawa, G. Carron and R. Mazzeo. Such invariant depends on the local structure of X, in particular on the links, but its explicit value is not known. We are going to show that if the links satisfy a Ricci positive lower bound, then we can compute the local Yamabe constant. In order to achieve this, we prove a lower bound for the spectrum of the Laplacian, by extending a well-known theorem by Lichenrowicz, and a Sobolev inequality, inspired by a result due to D. Bakry. Furthermore, we prove the existence of an Euclidean isoperimetric inequality on particular stratified space, with one stratum of codimension 2 and cone angle bigger than 2\pi.
