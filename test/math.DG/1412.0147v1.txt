We prove that a deformation of a hypersurface in a (n+1)-dimensional real space form {\mathbb S}^{n+1}_{p,1} induce a Hamiltonian variation of the normal congruence in the space {\mathbb L}({\mathbb S}^{n+1}_{p,1}) of oriented geodesics. As an application, we show that every Hamiltonian minimal sumbanifold in {\mathbb L}({\mathbb S}^{n+1}) (resp. {\mathbb L}({\mathbb H}^{n+1})) with respect to the (para-) Kaehler Einstein structure is locally the normal congruence of a hypersurface \Sigma in {\mathbb S}^{n+1} (resp. {\mathbb H}^{n+1}) that is a critical point of the functional {\cal W}(\Sigma)=\int_\Sigma\left(\Pi_{i=1}^n|\epsilon+k_i^2|\right)^{1/2}, where k_i denote the principal curvatures of \Sigma and \epsilon\in\{-1,1\}. In addition, for n=2, we prove that every Hamiltonian minimal surface in {\mathbb L}({\mathbb S}^{3}) (resp. {\mathbb L}({\mathbb H}^{3})) with respect to the (para-) Kaehler conformally flat structure is locally the normal congruence of a surface in {\mathbb S}^{3} (resp. {\mathbb H}^{3}) that is a critical point of the functional {\cal W}'(\Sigma)=\int_\Sigma\sqrt{H^2-K+1} (resp. {\cal W}'(\Sigma)=\int_\Sigma\sqrt{H^2-K-1}\; ), where H and K denote, respectively, the mean and Gaussian curvature of \Sigma.
