We consider different sub-Laplacians on a sub-Riemannian manifold M. Namely, we compare different natural choices for such operators, and give conditions under which they coincide. One of these operators is a sub-Laplacian we constructed previously in \cite{GordinaLaetsch2014a}. This operator is canonical with respect to the horizontal Brownian motion, we are able to define the sub-Laplacian without some a priori choice of measure. The other operator is \operatorname{div}^{\omega} \operatorname{grad}_{\mathcal{H}} for some volume form \omega on M. We illustrate our results by examples of three Lie groups equipped with a sub-Riemannian structure: \operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right), the Heisenberg group and the affine group.
