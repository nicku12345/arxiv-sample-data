The lightlike geometry of codimension two spacelike submanifolds in Lorentz-Minkowski space has been developed in [Izumiya, S. and Romero Fuster, M. C. Selecta Mathematica (NS), 13 23--55 (2007)] which is a natural Lorentzian analogue of the classical Euclidean differential geometry of hypersurfaces. In this paper we investigate a special class of surfaces (i.e., marginally trapped surfaces) in Minkowski space-time from the view point of the lightlike geometry.
