We look at complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature in \mathbb{R}^4. Similarly to the case of complex curves in \mathbb{C}^2 we introduce their {\it link at infinity}; we derive the {\it writhe number at infinity} which gives a formula for the total normal curvature of the surface. The knowledge of the link at infinity can sometimes help us determine if a surface has self-intersection and we illustrate this idea by looking at genus zero surfaces of small total curvature.
