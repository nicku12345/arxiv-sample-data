We prove that the only natural operations between differential forms are those obtained using linear combinations, the exterior product and the exterior differential. Our result generalises work by Palais and Freed-Hopkins.   As an application, we also deduce a theorem, originally due to Kolar, that determines those natural differential forms that can be associated to a connection on a principal bundle.
