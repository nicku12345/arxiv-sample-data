In generalized complex geometry, we revisit linear subspaces and submanifolds that have an induced generalized complex structure. We give an expression of the induced structure that allows us to deduce a smoothness criteria, we dualize the results to submersions and we make a few comments on generalized complex mappings. Then, we discuss submanifolds of generalized Kaehler manifolds that have an induced generalized Kaehler structure. These turn out to be the common invariant submanifolds of the two classical complex structures of the generalized Kaehler manifold.
