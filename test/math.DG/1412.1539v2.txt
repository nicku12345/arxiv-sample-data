The well known Chen's conjecture on biharmonic submanifolds states that a biharmonic submanifold in a Euclidean space is a minimal one ([10-13, 16, 18-21, 8]). For the case of hypersurfaces, we know that Chen's conjecture is true for biharmonic surfaces in \mathbb E^3 ([10], [24]), biharmonic hypersurfaces in \mathbb E^4 ([23]), and biharmonic hypersurfaces in \mathbb E^m with at most two distinct principal curvatures ([21]). The most recent work of Chen-Munteanu [18] shows that Chen's conjecture is true for \delta(2)-ideal hypersurfaces in \mathbb E^m, where a \delta(2)-ideal hypersurface is a hypersurface whose principal curvatures take three special values: \lambda_1, \lambda_2 and \lambda_1+\lambda_2. In this paper, we prove that Chen's conjecture is true for hypersurfaces with three distinct principal curvatures in \mathbb E^m with arbitrary dimension, thus, extend all the above-mentioned results. As an application we also show that Chen's conjecture is true for O(p)\times O(q)-invariant hypersurfaces in Euclidean space \mathbb E^{p+q}.
