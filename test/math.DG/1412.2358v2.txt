In this paper a conformal classification of three dimensional left-invariant sub-Riemannian contact structures is carried out; in particular we will prove the following dichotomy: either a structure is locally conformal to the Heisenberg group \mathbb H_3, or its conformal classification coincides with the metric one. If a structure is locally conformally flat, then its conformal group is locally isomorphic to SU(2,1).
