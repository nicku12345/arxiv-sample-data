The only known example of collapsed three-dimensional complete gradient steady Ricci solitons so far is the 3D cigar soliton N^2\times \mathbb{R}, the product of Hamilton's cigar soliton N^2 and the real line \mathbb{R} with the product metric. R. Hamilton has conjectured that there should exist a family of collapsed positively curved three-dimensional complete gradient steady solitons, with \mathsf{S}^1-symmetry, connecting the 3D cigar soliton. In this paper, we make the first initial progress and prove that the infinitesimal deformation at the 3D cigar soliton is non-essential. In Appendix A, we show that the 3D cigar soliton is the unique complete nonflat gradient steady Ricci soliton in dimension three that admits two commuting Killing vector fields.
