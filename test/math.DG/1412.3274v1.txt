In the present paper we study normal transport surfaces in four-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{E}^{4} which are the generalization of surface offsets in \mathbb{E}^{3}. We find some results of normal transport surfaces in \mathbb{E}^{4} of evolute and parallel type. Further, we give some examples of these type of surfaces.
