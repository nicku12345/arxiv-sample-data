In this short paper we extend the classical Hoffman-Meeks Halfspace Theorem to self-shrinkers, that is: "Let P  be a hyperplane passing through the origin. The only properly immersed self-shrinker \Sigma contained in one of the closed half-space determined by P is \Sigma = P."   Our proof is geometric and uses a catenoid type hypersurface discovered by Kleene-Moller. Also, using a similar geometric idea, we obtain that the only complete self-shrinker properly immersed in an closed cylinder  \overline{B ^{k+1} (R)} \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}, for some k\in \{1, \ldots ,n\} and radius R, R \leq \sqrt{2k}, is the cylinder \mathbb S ^k (\sqrt{2k}) \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}. We also extend the above results for \lambda -hypersurfaces.
