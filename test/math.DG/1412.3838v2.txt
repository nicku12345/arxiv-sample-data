The paper proposes a notion of volume element for Finsler spaces with metrics of Lorentzian signature, equipped with a time orientation. This notion is based on a slight modification of the idea of Holmes-Thompson volume element working for positive definite Finsler metrics and can be used in field-theoretical applications on a Finslerian background. Though the approach assumes the existence of a time orientation, the volume element does not depend on its choice.
