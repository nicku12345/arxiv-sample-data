Measure contraction properties MCP(K,N) are synthetic Ricci curvature lower bounds for metric measure spaces which do not necessarily have smooth structures. It is known that if a Riemannian manifold has dimension N, then MCP(K,N) is equivalent to Ricci curvature bounded below by K. On the other hand, it was observed in \cite{Ri} that there is a family of left invariant metrics on the three dimensional Heisenberg group for which the Ricci curvature is not bounded below. Though this family of metric spaces equipped with the Harr measure satisfy MCP(0,5).   In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for a 2n+1 dimensional weakly Sasakian manifold to satisfy MCP(0,2n+3). This extends the above mentioned result on the Heisenberg group in \cite{Ri}.
