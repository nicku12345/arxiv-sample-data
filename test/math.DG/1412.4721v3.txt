It is shown that a simple Lie group G ( \neq {\rm SL}_2) can be locally characterised by an integrability condition on an \operatorname{Aut}(\mathfrak{g}) structure on the tangent bundle, where \operatorname{Aut}(\mathfrak{g}) is the automorphism group of the Lie algebra of G. The integrability condition is the vanishing of a torsion tensor of type (1,2). This is a slight improvement of an earlier result proved in [Min-Oo M., Ruh E.A., in Differential Geometry and Complex Analysis, Springer, Berlin, 1985, 205-211].
