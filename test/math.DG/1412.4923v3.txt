We discuss the cobordism type of spin manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature. We show that in each dimension 4k \geq 12, there are infinitely many cobordism types of simply connected and nonnegatively curved spin manifolds. Moreover, we raise and analyze a question about possible cobordism obstructions to nonnegative curvature.
