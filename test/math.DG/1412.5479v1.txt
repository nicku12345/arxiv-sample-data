In this paper, we have studied biharmonic hypersurfaces in space form \bar{M}^{n+1}(c) with constant sectional curvature c. We have obtained that biharmonic hypersurfaces M^{n} with at most three distinct principal curvatures in \bar{M}^{n+1}(c) has constant mean curvature. We also obtain the full classification of biharmonic hypersurfaces with at most three distinct principal curvatures in arbitrary dimension space form \bar{M}^{n+1}(c).
