We obtain a complete classification of proper biharmonic hypersurfaces with at most three distinct principal curvatures in sphere spaces with arbitrary dimension. Precisely, together with known results of Balmu\c{s}-Montaldo-Oniciuc, we prove that compact orientable proper biharmonic hypersurfaces with at most three distinct principal curvatures in sphere spaces \mathbb S^{n+1} are either the hypersphere \mathbb S^n(1/\sqrt2) or the Clifford hypersurface \mathbb S^{n_1}(1/\sqrt2)\times\mathbb S^{n_2}(1/\sqrt2) with n_1+n_2=n and n_1\neq n_2. Moreover, we also show that there does not exist proper biharmonic hypersurface with at most three distinct principal curvatures in hyperbolic spaces \mathbb H^{n+1}.
