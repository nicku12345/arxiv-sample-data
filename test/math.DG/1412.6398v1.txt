A totally geodesic map f:\mathcal X_1\to\mathcal X_2 between Hermitian symmetric spaces is tight if its image contains geodesic triangles of maximal area. Tight maps were first introduced in [BIW09], and were classified in [Ham13, Ham14, HO14] in the case of irreducible domain. We complete the classification by analyzing also maps from reducible domains. This has applications to the study of maximal representations and of the Hitchin component for representations in the groups Sp(2n,\mathbb R).
