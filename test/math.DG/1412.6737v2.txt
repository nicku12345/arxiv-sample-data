Applying the DPW version of the theory developed by Burstall and Guest for harmonic maps of finite uniton type, we derive a coarse classification of Willmore two-spheres in S^{n+2} in terms of the normalized potential of their (harmonic) conformal Gauss maps. Moreover, for the case of S^6, some geometric properties of the corresponding Willmore two-spheres are discussed. The classical classification of Willmore two-spheres in S^4 are also derived as a corollary.
