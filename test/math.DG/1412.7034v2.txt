In this paper, we prove logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and derive the Hamilton Harnack inequality for the heat semigroup of the Witten Laplacian on complete Riemannian manifolds equipped with K-super Perelman Ricci flow. We establish the W-entropy formula for the heat equation of the Witten Laplacian and prove a rigidity theorem on complete Riemannian manifolds satisfying the CD(K, m) condition, and extend the W-entropy formula to time dependent Witten Laplacian on compact Riemannian manifolds with (K, m)-super Perelman Ricci flow, where K\in \mathbb{R} and m\in [n, \infty] are two constants. Finally, we prove the Li-Yau and the Li-Yau-Hamilton Harnack inequalities for positive solutions to the heat equation \partial_t u=Lu associated to the time dependent Witten Laplacian on compact or complete manifolds equipped with variants of the (K, m)-super Ricci flow.
