Let \mathfrak{g} be a 2n-dimensional unimodular Lie algebra equipped with a Hermitian structure (J,F) such that the complex structure J is abelian and the fundamental form F is balanced. We prove that the holonomy group of the associated Bismut connection reduces to a subgroup of SU(n-k), being 2k the dimension of the center of \mathfrak{g}. We determine conditions that allow a unimodular Lie algebra to admit this particular type of structures. Moreover, we give methods to construct them in arbitrary dimensions and classify them if the Lie algebra is 8-dimensional and nilpotent.
