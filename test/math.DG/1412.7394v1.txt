We prove that proper biharmonic hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature in Euclidean sphere \mathbb S^5 must have constant mean curvature. Moreover, we also show that there exist no proper biharmonic hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature in Euclidean space \mathbb E^5 or hyperbolic space \mathbb H^5, which give affirmative partial answers to Chen's conjecture and Generalized Chen's conjecture.
