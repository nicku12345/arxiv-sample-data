We consider quasiconformal deformations of \mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{Z}. We give some criteria for infinitely often punctured planes to be quasiconformally equivalent to \mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{Z}. In particular, we characterize the closed subsets of \mathbb{R} whose compliments are quasiconformally equivalent to \mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{Z}.
