Making use of Murakami's classification of outer involutions in a Lie algebra and following the Morse-theoretic approach to harmonic two-spheres in Lie groups introduced by Burstall and Guest, we obtain a new classification of harmonic two-spheres in outer symmetric spaces and a Weierstrass-type representation for such maps. Several examples of harmonic maps into classical outer symmetric spaces are given in terms of meromorphic functions on S^2.
