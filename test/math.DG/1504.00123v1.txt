We characterize biharmonic anti-invariant surfaces in 3-dimensional generalized (\kappa, \mu)-manifolds with non-zero constant mean curvature by means of the scalar curvature of the ambient space and the mean curvature. In addition, we give a method for constructing infinity many examples of biharmonic submanifolds in a certain 3-dimensional generalized (\kappa, \mu)-manifold. Moreover, we determine 3-dimensional generalized (\kappa, \mu)-manifolds which admit a certain kind of proper biharmonic foliation.
