In this paper, we prove that for every Finsler n-dimensional sphere (S^{n},F) with reversibility \lm and flag curvature K satisfying \left(\frac{\lm}{1+\lm}\right)^2<K\le 1, either there exist infinitely many closed geodesics, or there exist at least two elliptic closed geodesics and each linearized Poincar\'{e} map has at least one eigenvalue of the form e^{\sqrt{-1}\th} with \th being an irrational multiple of \pi.
