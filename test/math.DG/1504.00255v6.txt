A Riemannian manifold is called almost positively curved if the set of points for which all 2-planes have positive sectional curvature is open and dense. We find three new examples of almost positively curved manifolds: Sp(3)/Sp(1)^2, and two circle quotients of Sp(3)/Sp(1)^2. We also show the quasi-positively curved metric of Tapp [26]} on Sp(n+1)/Sp(n-1) Sp(1) is not almost positively curved if n\geq 3.
