There are considered 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spaces with inner products of signature (3,1) and (2,2). The objects of investigation are space-like and time-like hyperspheres in the respective cases. These hypersurfaces are equipped with almost contact B-metric structures. The constructed manifolds are characterized geometrically.
