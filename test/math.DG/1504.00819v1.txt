We develop a new approach on the (1+3) threading of spacetime (M, g) with respect to a congruence of curves defined by an arbitrary timelike vector field. The study is based on spatial tensor fields and on the Riemannian spatial connection \nabla^{\star}, which behave as 3D geometric objects. We obtain new formulas for local components of the Ricci tensor field of (M, g) with respect to the threading frame field, in terms of the Ricci tensor field of \nabla^{\star} and of kinematic quantities. Also, new expressions for time covariant derivatives of kinematic quantities are stated. In particular, a new form of Raychaudhuri's equation enables us to prove Lemma 6.2, which completes a well known lemma used in the proof of Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems.Finally, we apply the new (1+3) formalism to the study of the dynamics of a Kerr-Newman black hole.
