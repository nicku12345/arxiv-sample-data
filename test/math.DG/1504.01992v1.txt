Motivated by manifold learning techniques, we give an explicit lower bound for how far a smoothly embedded compact submanifold in {\mathbb R}^N can move in a normal direction and remain an embedding. In addition, given a penalty function P : \text{Emb}(M,\mathbb{R}^N) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}  on the space of embeddings, we give a condition which guarantees that the gradient \nabla P of the penalty function is normal to \phi(M) at every point.
