The present paper deals with the proper existence of a generalized class of recurrent manifolds, namely, hyper-generalized recurrent manifolds. We have established the proper existence of various generalized notions of recurrent manifolds. For this purpose we have presented a metric and computed its curvature properties and finally we have obtained the existence of a new class of semi-Riemannian manifolds which are non-recurrent but hyper-generalized recurrent, Ricci recurrent, conharmonically recurrent, manifold of recurrent curvature 2-forms and semisymmetric; not weakly symmetric but weakly Ricci symmetric, conformally weakly symmetric and conharmonically weakly symmetric; non-Einstein but Ricci simple; do not satisfy P\cdot P =0 but fulfills the condition P \cdot P = -\frac{1}{3}Q(S, P), P being the projective curvature tensor.
