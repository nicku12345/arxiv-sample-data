Hildebrand classified all semi-homogeneous cones in \mathbb{R}^3 and computed their corresponding complete hyperbolic affine spheres. We compute isothermal parametrizations for Hildebrand's new examples. After giving their affine metrics and affine cubic forms, we construct the whole associated family for each of Hildebrand's examples. The generic member of these affine spheres is given by Weierstrass \mathscr{P}, ~\zeta ~\text{and} ~\sigma functions. In general any regular convex cone in \mathbb{R}^3 has a natural associated S^1-family of such cones, which deserve further studies.
