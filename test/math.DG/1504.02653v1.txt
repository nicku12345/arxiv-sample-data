A classical theorem states that the group of automorphisms of a manifold M preserving a G-structure of finite type is a Lie group. We generalize this statement to the category of cs manifolds and give some examples, some of which being generalizations of classical notions, others being particular to the super case. Notably, we have to introduce a new notion of supermanifolds which we call mixed supermanifolds.
