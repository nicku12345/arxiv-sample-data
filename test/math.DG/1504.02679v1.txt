Using a model for the bundle \hat{\mathcal F}^2M of semi-holonomic second order frames of a manifold M as an extension of the bundle {\mathcal F}^2M of holonomic second order frames of M, we introduce in \hat{\mathcal F}^2M a principal bundle structure over {\mathcal F}^2M, the structure group being the additive group A_2(n) of skew-symmetric bilinear maps from {\Bbb R}^2 \times {\Bbb R}^n into {\Bbb R}^n. The composition of the projection of that structure with the existing projection of the bundle \tilde{\mathcal F}^2M of non-holonomic second order frames of M over \hat{\mathcal F}^2M provides a principal bundle structure in \tilde{\mathcal F}^2M over {\mathcal F}^2M. These results close an existing gap in the theory of second order frame bundles.
