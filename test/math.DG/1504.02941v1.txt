Let H be a hypersurface in \mathbb R^n and let \pi be an orthogonal projection in \mathbb R^n restricted to H. We say that H satisfies the Archimedean projection property corresponding to \pi if there exists a constant C such that Vol(\pi^{-1}(U)) = C \cdot Vol(U) for every measurable U in the range of \pi. It is well-known that the (n-1)-dimensional sphere, as a hypersurface in \mathbb R^n, satisfies the Archimedean projection property corresponding to any codimension 2 orthogonal projection in \mathbb R^n, the range of any such projection being an (n-2)-dimensional ball. Here we construct new hypersurfaces that satisfy Archimedean projection properties. Our construction works for any projection codimension k, 2 \leq k \leq n - 1, and it allows us to specify a wide variety of desired projection ranges \Omega^{n-k} \subset \mathbb R^{n-k}. Letting \Omega^{n-k} be an (n-k)-dimensional ball for each k, it produces a new family of smooth, compact hypersurfaces in \mathbb R^n satisfying codimension k Archimedean projection properties that includes, in the special case k = 2, the (n-1)-dimensional spheres.
