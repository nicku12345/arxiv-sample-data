We establish several Witten type rigidity and vanishing theorems for twisted Toeplitz operators on odd dimensional manifolds. We obtain our results by combining the modular method, modular transgression and some careful analysis of odd Chern classes for cocycles in odd K-theory. Moreover we discover that in odd dimensions, the fundamental group of manifolds plays an important role in the rigidity.
