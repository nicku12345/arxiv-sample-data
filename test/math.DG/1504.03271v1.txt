The object of the present paper is to obtain the characterization of a warped product semi-Riemannian manifold with a special type of recurrent like structure, called super generalized recurrent. As consequence of this result we also find out the necessary and sufficient conditions for a warped product manifold to satisfy some other recurrent like structures such as weakly generalized recurrent manifold, hyper generalized recurrent manifold etc. Finally as a support of the main result, we present an example of warped product super generalized recurrent manifold.
