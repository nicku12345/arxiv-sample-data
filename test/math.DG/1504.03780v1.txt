Let f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 be complete Willmore immersion with \int_{\Sigma}|A_f|^2<+\infty. We will show that if f is the limit of an embedded surface sequence, then f is a plane. As an application, we prove that if \Sigma_k is a sequence of closed Willmore surface embedded in \mathbb{R}^3 with W(\Sigma_k)<C, and if the conformal class of \Sigma_k converges in the moduli space, then we can find a M\"obius transformation \sigma_k, such that a subsequence of \sigma_k(\Sigma_k) converges smoothly.
