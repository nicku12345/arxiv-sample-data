In this paper we derive the Euler-Lagrange equation of the functional L_\beta=\int_\Sigma\frac{1}{\cos^\beta\alpha}d\mu, ~~\beta\neq -1 in the class of symplectic surfaces. It is \cos^3\alpha {\bf{H}}=\beta(J(J\nabla\cos\alpha)^\top)^\bot, which is an elliptic equation when \beta\geq 0. We call such a surface a \beta-symplectic critical surface. We first study the properties for each fixed \beta-symplectic critical surface and then prove that the set of \beta where there is a stable \beta-symplectic critical surface is open. We believe it should be also closed. As a precise example, we study rotationally symmetric \beta-symplectic critical surfaces in {\mathbb C}^2 carefully .
