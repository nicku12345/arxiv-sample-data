Three-dimensional almost contact B-metric manifolds are constructed by a three-parametric family of Lie groups. It is established the class of the investigated manifolds which has an important geometrical interpretation. It is determined also the type of the constructed Lie algebras in the Bianchi classification. There are given some geometric characteristics and properties of the considered manifolds.
