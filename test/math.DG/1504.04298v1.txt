This paper uses Karcher's formulation [Kar99] of the O'Neill tensors [O'N66,Gra67] to derive a concise formula for the family \Omega^\epsilon of curvature forms obtained by shrinking the fibers of a submersion \pi:M\to B of semi-Riemannian manifolds by a factor of 1-\epsilon. The formula clearly shows that as \epsilon approaches 1, \Omega^\epsilon approaches the sum of the vertical curvature form \Omega^\mathrm{V} and the pullback \pi^*\Omega^B of the curvature form of B. The Gauss-Bonnet integrand \mathrm{Pf}(\Omega^\epsilon) therefore approaches the wedge \mathrm{Pf}(\Omega^\mathrm{V})\wedge\pi^*\mathrm{Pf}(\Omega^B). So if \pi has compact fiber F, the pushforward \pi_*\mathrm{Pf}(\Omega^\epsilon) approaches \chi(F)\cdot\mathrm{Pf}(\Omega^B).
