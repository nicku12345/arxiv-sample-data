We study conditions for which the mapping torus of a 6-manifold endowed with an SU(3)-structure is a locally conformal calibrated G_2-manifold, that is, a 7-manifold endowed with a G_2-structure \varphi such that d \varphi = - \theta \wedge \varphi for a closed non-vanishing 1-form \theta. Moreover, we show that if (M, \varphi) is a compact locally conformal calibrated G_2-manifold with \mathcal{L}_{\theta^{\#}} \varphi =0, where {\theta^{\#}} is the dual of \theta with respect to the Riemannian metric g_{\varphi} induced by \varphi, then M is a fiber bundle over S^1 with a coupled SU(3)-manifold as fiber.
