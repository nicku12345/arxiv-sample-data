The Blaschke's conjecture asserts that if \diam(M)=\text{Inj}(M)=\frac\pi2 (up to a rescaling) for a complete Riemannian manifold M, then M is isometric to \Bbb S^n(\frac12), {\Bbb R\Bbb P}^{n}, {\Bbb C\Bbb P}^{n}, {\Bbb H\Bbb P}^{n} or {\Bbb Ca\Bbb P}^{2} endowed with the canonical metric. In the paper, we prove that the conjecture is true if we in addition assume that \sec_M\geq1.
