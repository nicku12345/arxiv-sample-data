There are introduced and studied a pair of associated Schouten-van Kampen affine connections adapted to the contact distribution and an almost contact B-metric structure generated by the pair of associated B-metrics and their Levi-Civita connections. By means of the constructed non-symmetric connections, the basic classes of almost contact B-metric manifolds are characterized. Curvature properties of the considered connections are obtained.
