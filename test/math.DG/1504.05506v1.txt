We consider G_{2}-structures on 7-manifolds that are warped products of an interval and a six-manifold, which is either a Calabi-Yau manifold, or a nearly K\"{a}hler manifold. We show that in these cases the G_{2}-structures are determined by their torsion components up to a phase factor. We then study the modified Laplacian coflow \frac{d\psi }{dt}=\Delta _{\psi }\psi +2d\left( \left( C-Tr T\right) \varphi \right)  of these G_{2}-structures, where \varphi  and \psi  are the fundamental 3-form and 4 -form which define the G_{2}-structure and \Delta _{\psi } is the Hodge Laplacian associated with the G_{2}-structure. This flow is known to have short-time existence and uniqueness. We analyse the soliton equations for this flow and obtain new compact soliton solutions.
