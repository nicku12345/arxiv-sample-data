We show the existence of nonsymmetric homogeneous spin Riemannian manifolds whose Dirac operator is like that on a Riemannian symmetric spin space. Such manifolds are exactly the homogeneous spin Riemannian manifolds (M,g) which are traceless cyclic with respect to some quotient expression M=G/K and reductive decomposition \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{m}. Using transversally symmetric fibrations of noncompact type, we give a list of them.
