On the ambient space of a Lie group with a left invariant metric that is isometric and isomorphic to a semidirect product \mathbb{R}^2\rtimes_A\mathbb{R}, we consider a domain \Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2\rtimes_A\{0\} and vertical \pi-graphs over \Omega and study the partial differential equation a function u:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} must satisfy in order to have prescribed mean curvature H. Using techniques from quasilinear elliptic equations we prove that if a \pi-graph has non-negative mean curvature, then it satisfy some uniform height estimates that depend on \Omega and on a parameter \alpha, given a priori. When \text{trace}(A) > 0, these estimates imply that the oscillation of a minimal graph assuming the same constant value n along the boundary tends to zero when n\rightarrow + \infty and goes to + \infty if n\rightarrow - \infty. Furthermore, we use some of the estimates, allied with techniques from Killing graphs, to prove the existence of minimal \pi-graphs assuming the value 0 along a piecewise smooth curve \gamma with endpoints p_1,\,p_2 and having as boundary \gamma \cup (\{p_1\}\times[0,\,+\infty))\cup(\{p_2\}\times[0,\,+\infty)).
