In a recent work, Galloway [9] proved a local foliation theorem by MOTSs for a 3-dimensional initial data set (M,g,K) with mean curvature \tau\le0 in a 4-dimensional spacetime (\overline M,\overline g) when (under suitable assumptions) M has a stable spherical MOTS \Sigma which achieves an upper bound for the area. He proved that each leaf is a round 2-sphere with the same constant Gaussian curvature. Here, we improve his result by dropping the hypothesis on the mean curvature of M and showing that each leaf is a minimal surface. We show that in an outer neighborhood U of \Sigma, the metric g splits as the product ([0,\varepsilon)\times\Sigma,dt^2+g_0), where (\Sigma,g_0) is a round 2-sphere. In fact, we prove that the outer neighborhood U can be isometrically embedded into the 4-dimensional Nariai spacetime (\overline N,\overline h) as a spacelike hypersurface so that g|_U is the induced metric from \overline N and K|_U is the second fundamental form of U in \overline N. This completely classifies the local geometry of such initial data sets.
