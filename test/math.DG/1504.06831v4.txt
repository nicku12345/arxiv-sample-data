Self-shrinkers are important geometric objects in the study of mean curvature flows, while the Bernstein Theorem is one of the most profound results in minimal surface theory. We prove a Bernstein type result for graphical self-shrinker surfaces with codimension two in \mathbb{R}^4. Namely, under certain natural conditions on the Jacobian of any smooth map from \mathbb{R}^2 to \mathbb{R}^2, we show that the self-shrinker which is the graph of this map must be affine linear. The proof relies on the derivation of structure equations of graphical self-shrinkers in terms of the parallel form, and the existence of some positive functions on self-shrinkers related to these Jacobian conditions.
