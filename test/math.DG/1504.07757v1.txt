In this paper, we study generalized constant ratio (GCR) hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces. We mainly focus on the hypersurfaces in \mathbb E^4. First, we deal with \delta(2)-ideal GCR hypersurfaces. Then, we study on hypersurfaces with constant (first) mean curvature. Finally, we obtain the complete classification of GCR hypersurfaces with vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature. We also give some explicit examples.   Keywords: Generalized constant ratio submanifolds, \delta(r)-invariant hypersurfaces, constant mean curvature, Gauss-Kronecker curvature
