The object of the present paper is to study locally \phi-symmetric LP-Sasakian manifolds admitting semi-symmetric metric connection and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a locally \phi-symmetric LP-Sasakian manifold with respect to semi-symmetric metric connection to be locally \phi-symmetric LP-Sasakian manifold with respect to Levi-Civita connection.
