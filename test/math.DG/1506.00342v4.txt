In this paper we show that an expanding or steady gradient Ricci soliton warped product B^n\times_f F^m, m>1, whose warping function f reaches both maximum and minimum must be a Riemannian product. Moreover, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for constructing a gradient Ricci soliton warped product. As an application, we present a class of expanding Ricci soliton warped product having as a fiber an Einstein manifold with non-positive scalar curvature. We also discuss some obstructions to this construction, especially in the case when the base of the warped product is compact.
