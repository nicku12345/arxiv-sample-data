This is a sequel to our paper arXiv:1402.2546 to appear in the Journal of Geometric Analysis in which we concentrate on developing some of the topological properties of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we explicitly compute the cohomology rings for several cases not treated in arXiv:1402.2546 and give a formula for homotopy equivalence in one particular 7-dimensional case.
