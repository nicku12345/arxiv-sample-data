Let G/H be a Riemannian homogeneous space. For an orthogonal representation \phi of H on the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{k+1}, there corresponds the vector bundle E=G\times_{\phi}\mathbb{R}^{k+1} \to G/H with fiberwise inner product. Provided that \phi is the direct sum of at most two representations which are either trivial or irreducible, we construct metrics of constant scalar curvature on the unit sphere bundle UE of E. When G/H is the round sphere, we study the number of constant scalar curvature metrics in the conformal classes of these metrics.
