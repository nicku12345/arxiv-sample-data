The main result is an explicit expression for the Pressure Metric on the Hitchin component of surface group representations into PSL(n,R) along the Fuchsian locus. The expression is in terms of a parametrization of the tangent space by holomorphic differentials, and it gives a precise relationship with the Petersson pairing. Along the way, variational formulas are established that generalize results from classical Teichmueller theory, such as Gardiner's formula, the relationship between length functions and Fenchel-Nielsen deformations, and variations of cross ratios.
