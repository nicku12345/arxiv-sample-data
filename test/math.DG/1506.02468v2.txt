H. Hotelling proved that in the n-dimensional Euclidean or spherical space, the volume of a tube of small radius about a curve depends only on the length of the curve and the radius. A. Gray and L. Vanhecke extended Hotelling's theorem to rank one symmetric spaces computing the volumes of the tubes explicitly in these spaces. In the present paper, we generalize these results by showing that every harmonic manifold has the above tube property. We compute the volume of tubes in the Damek-Ricci spaces. We show that if a Riemannian manifold has the tube property, then it is a 2-stein D'Atri space. We also prove that a symmetric space has the tube property if and only if it is harmonic. Our results answer some questions posed by L. Vanhecke, T. J. Willmore, and G. Thorbergsson.
