In the differential geometry of certain F-structures, the role of W-curvature tensor is very well known. A detailed study of this tensor has been made on the spacetime of general relativity. The spacetimes satisfying Einstein field equations with vanishing W-tensor have been considered and the existence of Killing and conformal Killing vector fields has been established. Perfect fluid spacetimes with vanishing W-tensor have also been considered. The divergence of W-tensor is studied in detail and it is seen, among other results, that a perfect fluid spacetime with conserved W-tensor represents either an Einstein space or a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological model.
