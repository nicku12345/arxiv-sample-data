Let M^n\ (n\geq3) be a complete Riemannian manifold with \sec_M\geq 1, and let M_i^{n_i} (i=1,2) be two comlplete totally geodesic submanifolds in M. We prove that if n_1+n_2=n-2 and if the distance |M_1M_2|\geq\frac{\pi}{2}, then M_i is isometric to \Bbb S^{n_i}/\Bbb Z_h, {\Bbb C\Bbb P}^{\frac {n_i}2} or {\Bbb C\Bbb P}^{\frac {n_i}2}/\Bbb Z_2 with the canonical metric when n_i>0, and thus M is isometric to \Bbb S^n/\Bbb Z_h, {\Bbb C\Bbb P}^{\frac n2} or {\Bbb C\Bbb P}^{\frac n2}/\Bbb Z_2 except possibly when n=3 and M_1 (or M_2) \stackrel{\rm iso}{\cong}\Bbb S^{1}/\Bbb Z_h with h\geq 2 or n=4 and M_1 (or M_2) \stackrel{\rm iso}{\cong}\Bbb{RP}^2.
