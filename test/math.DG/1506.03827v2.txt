This paper is devoted to exploring the relationship between the [1,n)\ni p-capacity and the surface-area in \mathbb R^{n\ge 2} which especially shows: if \Omega\subset\mathbb R^n is a convex, compact, smooth set with its interior \Omega^\circ\not=\emptyset and the mean curvature H(\partial\Omega,\cdot)>0 of its boundary \partial\Omega then  \left(\frac{n(p-1)}{p(n-1)}\right)^{p-1}\le\frac{\left(\frac{\hbox{cap}_p(\Omega)}{\big(\frac{p-1}{n-p}\big)^{1-p}\sigma_{n-1}}\right)}{\left(\frac{\hbox{area}(\partial\Omega)}{\sigma_{n-1}}\right)^\frac{n-p}{n-1}}\le\left(\sqrt[n-1]{\int_{\partial\Omega}\big(H(\partial\Omega,\cdot)\big)^{n-1}\frac{d\sigma(\cdot)}{\sigma_{n-1}}}\right)^{p-1}\quad\forall\quad p\in (1,n)  whose limits 1\leftarrow p\ \&\ p\rightarrow n imply  1=\frac{cap_1(\Omega)}{\hbox{area}(\partial\Omega)}\ \ \& \ \int_{\partial\Omega}\big(H(\partial\Omega,\cdot)\big)^{n-1}\frac{d\sigma(\cdot)}{\sigma_{n-1}}\ge 1,  thereby not only discovering that the new best known constant is roughly half as far from the one conjectured by P\'olya-Szeg\"o in \cite[(2)]{P} but also extending the P\'olya-Szeg\"o inequality in \cite[(5)]{P}, with both the conjecture and the inequality being stated for the electrostatic capacity of a convex solid in \mathbb R^3.
