In this paper, we study the spherical indicatrices of W-direction curves in three dimensional Euclidean space which were defined by using the unit Darboux vector field W of a Frenet curve, in [11]. We obtain the Frenet apparatus of these spherical indicatrix curves and the characterizations of being general helix and slant helix. Moreover we give some properties between the spherical indicatrix curves and their associated curves. Then we investigate two special ruled surface that are normal and binormal surface by using W-direction curves. We give useful results involving the char- acterizations of these ruled surfaces. From those applications, we make use of such a work to interpret the Gaussian, mean curvatures of these surfaces and geodesic, normal curvature and geodesic torsion of the base curves with respect to these surfaces.
