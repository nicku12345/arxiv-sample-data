In this note we show that every (real or complex) vector bundle over a compact rank one symmetric space carries, after taking the Whitney sum with a trivial bundle of sufficiently large rank, a metric with nonnegative sectional curvature. We also examine the case of complex vector bundles over other manifolds, and give upper bounds for the rank of the trivial bundle that is necessary to add when the base is a sphere.
