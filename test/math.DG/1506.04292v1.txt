A Killing p-form on a Riemannian manifold is a p-form whose covariant derivative is totally anti-symmetric. In this paper we give the complete (local) description of 4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds (M,g) carrying non-parallel Killing 2-forms \varphi. If M is connected and oriented, we show that there exists a dense open subset of M on which one of the three exclusive situations holds: either \phi is everywhere degenerate and g is conformal to a product metric, or g is conformal to an ambik\"ahler metric obtained via the Calabi construction from a polarized Riemannian surface, or g is conformal to an ambitoric structure of hyperbolic type, and depends locally on two functions of one variable. We also give compact examples, by constructing infinite-dimensional families of Riemannian metrics carrying Killing 2-forms of each of the above types on S^4 and on Hirzebruch surfaces.
