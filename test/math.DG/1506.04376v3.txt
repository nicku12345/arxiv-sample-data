It is introduced a differentiable manifold with almost contact 3-structure which consists of an almost contact metric structure and two almost contact B-metric structures. The product of this manifold and a real line is an almost hypercomplex manifold with Hermitian-Norden metrics. It is proven that the introduced manifold of cosymplectic type is at. Some examples of the studied manifolds are given.
