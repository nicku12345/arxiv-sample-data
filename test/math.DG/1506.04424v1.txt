Let x: M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N} be an n-dimensional compact self-shrinker in \mathbb{R}^N with smooth boundary \partial\Omega. In this paper, we study eigenvalues of the operator \mathcal{L}_r on M, where \mathcal{L}_r is defined by \mathcal{L}_r=e^{\frac{|x|^2}{2}}{\rm div}(e^{-\frac{|x|^2}{2}}T^r\nabla\cdot) with T^r denoting a positive definite (0,2)-tensor field on M. We obtain "universal" inequalities for eigenvalues of the operator \mathcal{L}_r. These inequalities generalize the result of Cheng and Peng in \cite{ChengPeng2013}.   Furthermore, we also consider the case that equalities occur.
