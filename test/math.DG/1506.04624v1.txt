The Hermitian symmetric space M=\mathrm{EIII} appears in the classification of complete simply connected Riemannian manifolds carrying a parallel even Clifford structure. This means the existence of a real oriented Euclidean vector bundle E over it together with an algebra bundle morphism \varphi:\mathrm{Cl}^0(E) \rightarrow \mathrm{End}(TM) mapping \Lambda^2 E into skew-symmetric endomorphisms, and the existence of a metric connection on E compatible with \varphi. We give an explicit description of such a vector bundle E as a sub-bundle of \mathrm{End}(TM). From this we construct a canonical differential 8-form on \mathrm{EIII}, associated with its holonomy \mathrm{Spin}(10) \cdot \mathrm{U}(1) \subset \mathrm{U}(16), that represents a generator of its cohomology ring. We relate it with a Schubert cycle structure by looking at \mathrm{EIII} as the smooth projective variety V_{(4)} \subset \mathbb{C}P^{26} known as the fourth Severi variety.
