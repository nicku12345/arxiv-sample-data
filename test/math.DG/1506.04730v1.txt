A Darboux transformation for polarized space curves is introduced and its properties are studied, in particular, Bianchi permutability. Semi-discrete isothermic surfaces are described as sequences of Darboux transforms of polarized curves in the conformal n-sphere and their transformation theory is studied. Semi-discrete surfaces of constant mean curvature are studied as an application of the transformation theory.
