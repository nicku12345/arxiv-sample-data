The object of investigations are almost contact B-metric manifolds which are derived as a product of a real line and a 2-dimensional manifold equipped with a complex structure and a Norden metric. There are used two different methods for generation of the B-metric on the product manifold. The constructed manifolds are characterised with respect to the Ganchev-Mihova-Gribachev classification and their basic curvature properties.
