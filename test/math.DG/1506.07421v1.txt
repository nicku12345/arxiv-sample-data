A Hermitian symplectic manifold is a complex manifold endowed with a symplectic form \omega, for which the bilinear form \omega(I\cdot,\cdot) is positive definite. In this work we prove dd^c-lemma for 1- and (1,1)-forms for compact Hermitian symplectic manifolds of dimension 3. This shows that Albanese map for such manifolds is well-defined and allows one to prove K\"ahlerness if the dimension of the Albanese image of a manifold is maximal.
