We introduce a notion of twisted pure spinor in order to characterize, in a unified way, all the special Riemannian holonomy groups just as a classical pure spinor characterizes the special K\"ahler holonomy. Motivated by certain curvature identities satisfied by manifolds admitting parallel twisted pure spinors, we also introduce the Clifford monopole equations as a natural geometric generalization of the Seiberg-Witten equations. We show that they restrict to the Seiberg-Witten equations in 4 dimensions, and that they admit non-trivial solutions on manifolds with special Riemannian holonomy.
