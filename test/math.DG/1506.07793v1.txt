In this paper we prove that a complete, embedded minimal surface M in \mathbb{R}^3 with finite topology and compact boundary (possibly empty) is conformally a compact Riemann surface \overline{M} with boundary punctured in a finite number of interior points and that M can be represented in terms of meromorphic data on its conformal completion \overline{M}. In particular, we demonstrate that M is a minimal surface of finite type and describe how this property permits a classification of the asymptotic behavior of M.
