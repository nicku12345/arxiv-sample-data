We study homogenous Weyl connections with non-positive sectional curvatures. The Cartesian product \mathbb S^1 \times M carries canonical families of Weyl connections with such a property, for any Riemmanian manifold M. We prove that if a homogenous Weyl connection on a manifold, modeled on a unimodular Lie group, is non-positive in a stronger sense (streched non-positive), then it must be locally of the product type.
