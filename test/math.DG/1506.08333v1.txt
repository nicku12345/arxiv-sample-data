In this paper, we generalize the dualistic structures on warped product manifolds to the dualistic structures on generalized warped product manifolds. we develop an expression of curvature for the connection of the generalized warped product in relation to those corresponding analogues of its base and fiber and warping functions. we show that the dualistic structures on the base M_{_1} and the fiber M_{_2} induces a dualistic structure on the generalized warped product M_1\times M_2 and conversely, moreover, (M_{_1}\times M_{_1},G_{_{f_{_1}f_{_2}}}) or (M_{_1}\times M_{_1},\tilde{g}_{_{f_{_1}f_{_2}}}) is statistical manifold if and only if (M_{_1},g_{_1}) and (M_{_1},g_{_1}) are. Finally, Some interesting consequences are also given.
