Let \mathcal{M}_{0}^n be the class of closed, simply-connected, non-negatively curved Riemannian manifolds admitting an isometric, effective, isotropy-maximal torus action. We prove that if M\in \mathcal{M}_{0}^n, then M is equivariantly diffeomorphic to the free linear quotient by a torus of a product of spheres of dimensions greater than or equal to three. As an immediate consequence, we prove the Maximal Symmetry Rank Conjecture for all M\in \mathcal{M}_{0}^n. Finally, we show the Maximal Symmetry Rank Conjecture for simply-connected, non-negatively curved manifolds holds for dimensions less than or equal to nine without assuming the torus action is almost isotropy-maximal or isotropy-maximal.
