In this paper we determine the at least 4-dimensional affine reductive homogeneous manifolds for an at most 9-dimensional simple Lie group or an at most 6-dimensional semi-simple Lie group. Those reductive spaces among them which admit a sharply transitive differentiable section yield local almost differentiable left A-loops. Using this we classify all global almost differentiable left A-loops L having either a 6-dimensional semi-simple Lie group or the group SL_3(\mathbb R) as the group topologically generated by their left translations. Moreover, we determine all at most 5-dimensional left A-loops L with PSU_3(\mathbb C,1) as the group topologically generated by their left translations.
