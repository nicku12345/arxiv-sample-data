We treat the almost differentiable left A-loops as images of global differentiable sharply transitive sections \sigma :G/H \to G for a Lie group G such that G/H is a reductive homogeneous manifold. In this paper we classify all 3-dimensional connected strongly left alternative almost differentiable left A-loops L, such that for the corresponding section \sigma :G/H \to G the Lie group G is non-solvable.
