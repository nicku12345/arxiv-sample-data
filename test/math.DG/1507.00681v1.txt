For each n\geq 2 we construct a new closed embedded mean curvature self-shrinking hypersurface in \mathbb{R}^{2n}. These self-shrinkers are diffeomorphic to S^{n-1}\times S^{n-1}\times S^1 and are SO(n)\times SO(n) invariant. The method is inspired by constructions of Hsiang and these surfaces generalize self-shrinking "tori" diffeomorphic to S^{n-1}\times S^1 constructed by Angenent.
