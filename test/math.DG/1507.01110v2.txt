In this paper we generalize the main notions from the geometry of (almost) contact manifolds in the category of Lie algebroids. Also, using the framework of generalized geometry, we obtain an (almost) contact Riemannian Lie algebroid structure on a vertical Liouville distribution over the big-tangent manifold of a Riemannain manifold.
