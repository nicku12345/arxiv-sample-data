In this paper, we present two kinds of total Chern forms c(E,G) and \mathcal{C}(E,G) as well as a total Segre form s(E,G) of a holomorphic Finsler vector bundle \pi:(E,G)\to M expressed by the Finsler metric G, which answers a question of J. Faran (\cite{Faran}) to some extent. As some applications, we show that the signed Segre forms (-1)^ks_k(E,G) are positive (k,k)-forms on M when G is of positive Kobayashi curvature; we prove, under an extra assumption, that a Finsler-Einstein vector bundle in the sense of Kobayashi is semi-stable; we introduce a new definition of a flat Finsler metric, which is weaker than Aikou's one (\cite{Aikou}) and prove that a holomorphic vector bundle is Finsler flat in our sense if and only if it is Hermitian flat.
