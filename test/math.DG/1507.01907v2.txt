It was shown by Ramanathan \cite{R} that any compact oriented non-simply-connected minimal surface in the three-dimensional round sphere admits at most a finite set of pairwise noncongruent minimal isometric immersions. Here we show that this result extends to isotropic surfaces in spheres of arbitrary dimension. The case of non-compact isotropic surfaces in space forms is also addressed.
