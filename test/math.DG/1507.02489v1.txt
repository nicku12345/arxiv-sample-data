Let M,N be two smooth compact hypersurfaces of \mathbb{R}^n which bound strictly convex domains equipped with two absolutely continuous measures \mu and \nu (with respect to the volume measures of M and N). We consider the optimal transportation from \mu to \nu for the quadratic cost. Let (\phi:m \to \mathbb{R},\psi:N \to \mathbb{R}) be some functions which achieve the supremum in the Kantorovich formulation of the problem and which satisfy    \psi (y) = \inf_{z\in M} \Bigl( \frac{1}{2}|y-z|^2 -\varphi(z)\Bigr);   \varphi (x)=\inf_{z\in N} \Bigl( \frac{1}{2}|x-z|^2 -\psi(z)\Bigr). Define for y \in N, \varphi^\Box(y) = \sup_{z\in M} \Bigl( \frac{1}{2}|y-z|^2 -\varphi(z)\Bigr).   In this short paper, we exhibit a relationship between the regularity of \varphi^\Box and the existence of a solution to the Monge problem.
