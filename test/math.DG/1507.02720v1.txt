We classify irreducible polar foliations of codimension q on quaternionic projective spaces \mathbb H P^n, for all (n,q)\neq(7,1). We prove that all irreducible polar foliations of any codimension (resp. of codimension one) on \mathbb H P^n are homogeneous if and only if n+1 is a prime number (resp. n is even or n=1). This shows the existence of inhomogeneous examples of codimension one and higher.
