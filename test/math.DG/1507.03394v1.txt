We demonstrate that every non-tubular channel linear Weingarten surface in Euclidean space is a surface of revolution, hence parallel to a catenoid or a rotational surface of non-zero constant Gauss curvature. We provide explicit parametrizations and deduce existence of complete hyperbolic linear Weingarten surfaces.
