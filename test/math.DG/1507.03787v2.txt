It is known that the only finite-dimensional diffeological vector space that admits a diffeologically smooth scalar product is the standard space of appropriate dimension. In this note we consider a way to circumnavigate this issue, by introducing a notion of pseudo-metric, which, said informally, is the least-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on a given space. We apply this notion to make some observation on subspaces which split off as smooth direct summands (providing examples which illustrate that not all subspaces do), and then to show that the diffeological dual of a finite-dimensional diffeological vector space always has the standard diffeology and in particular, any pseudo-metric on the initial space induces, in the obvious way, a smooth scalar product on the dual.
