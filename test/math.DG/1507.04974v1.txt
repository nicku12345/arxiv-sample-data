Let (X, g_0) be a simply connected, complete, negatively curved Riemannian manifold. We prove local and infinitesimal rigidity results for compactly supported deformations of the metric g_0. For any negatively curved metric g equal to g_0 outside a compact, the identity map of X induces a natural boundary map between the boundaries at infinity of X with respect to g_0 and g. We show that if (g_t) is a smooth 1-parameter family of negatively curved metrics all equal to g_0 outside a fixed compact then if all the boundary maps (between the boundaries of X with respect to g_0 and g_t) are Moebius then the metrics g_t are all isometric to g_0. We also show that given a compact K in X, there is a neighbourhood of g_0 in the C^{2,\alpha} topology such that for any negatively curved metric g in this neighbourhood which is equal to g_0 outside K, if the boundary map is Moebius and the g_0 and g volumes of K agree then g is isometric to g_0.
