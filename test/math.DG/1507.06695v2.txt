Catenoids in de Sitter 3-space S^3_1 belong to a certain class of space-like constant mean curvature one surfaces. In a previous work, the authors classified such catenoids, and found that two different classes of countably many exceptional elliptic catenoids are not realized as closed subsets in S^3_1. Here we show that such exceptional catenoids have closed analytic extensions in S^3_1 with interesting properties.
