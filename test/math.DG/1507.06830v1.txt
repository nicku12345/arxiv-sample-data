Y. J. Suh and H. Lee (Bull. Korean. Math. Soc. 47, 551-561 (2010)) characterized real hypersurfaces M of type B by the invariance of vector bundle JTM^\perp under the shape operator and the orthogonality of JTM^\perp and \mathcal {J}TM^\perp, where TM^\perp, J and \mathcal J are the normal bundle of M, K\"ahler structure and Quaternionic K\"ahler structure of G_2({\mathbb{C}}^{m+2}) respectively. In this paper, we characterize real hypersurfaces M of type A by the invariance of the vector bundle JTM^\perp under the shape operator with the Reeb vector field in \mathcal {J}TM^\perp.
