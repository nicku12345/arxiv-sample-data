In this paper we consider a set E\subset\Omega with prescribed mean curvature f\in C(\Omega) and Euclidean Lipschitz boundary \partial E=\Sigma inside a three-dimensional contact sub-Riemannian manifold M. We prove that if \Sigma is locally a regular intrinsic graph, the characteristic curves are of class C^2. The result is shape and improves the ones contained in \cite{MR2583494} and \cite{GalRit15}.
