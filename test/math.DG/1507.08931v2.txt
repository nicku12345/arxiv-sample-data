We establish volume comparison results for balls in Riemannian manifolds with C^{1,1}-metrics with a lower bound on the Ricci tensor and for the evolution of spacelike, acausal, causally complete hypersurfaces with an upper bound on the mean curvature in spacetimes with C^{1,1}-metrics with a lower bound on the timelike Ricci curvature. These results are then used to give proofs of Myers' theorem and of Hawking's singularity theorem in this regularity.
