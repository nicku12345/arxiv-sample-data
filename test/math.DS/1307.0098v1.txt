The Morse-Hedlund Theorem states that a bi-infinite sequence \eta in a finite alphabet is periodic if and only if there exists n\in\N such that the block complexity function P_\eta(n) satisfies P_\eta(n)\leq n. In dimension two, Nivat conjectured that if there exist n,k\in\N such that the n\times k rectangular complexity P_{\eta}(n,k) satisfies P_{\eta}(n,k)\leq nk, then \eta is periodic. Sander and Tijdeman showed that this holds for k\leq2. We generalize their result, showing that Nivat's Conjecture holds for k\leq3. The method involves translating the combinatorial problem to a question about the nonexpansive subspaces of a certain \ZZ dynamical system, and then analyzing the resulting system.
