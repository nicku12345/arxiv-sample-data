We describe the basic lattice structures of attractors and repellers in dynamical systems. The structure of distributive lattices allows for an algebraic treatment of gradient-like dynamics in general dynamical systems, both invertible and noninvertible. We separate those properties which rely solely on algebraic structures from those that require some topological arguments, in order to lay a foundation for the development of algorithms to manipulate these structures computationally.
