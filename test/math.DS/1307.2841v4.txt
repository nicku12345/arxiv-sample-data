We investigate how the Hausdorff dimension and measure of a self-similar set K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d} behave under linear images. This depends on the nature of the group \mathcal{T} generated by the orthogonal parts of the defining maps of K. We show that if \mathcal{T} is finite then every linear image of K is a graph directed attractor and there exists at least one projection of K such that the dimension drops under the image of the projection. In general, with no restrictions on \mathcal{T} we establish that \mathcal{H}^{t}(L\circ O(K))=\mathcal{H}^{t}(L(K)) for every element O of the closure of \mathcal{T}, where L is a linear map and t=\dim_{H}K. We also prove that for disjoint subsets A and \textbf{B} of K we have that \mathcal{H}^{t}(L(A)\cap L(B))=0. Hochman and Shmerkin showed that if \mathcal{T} is dense in SO(d,\mathbb{R}) and the strong separation condition is satisfied then \dim_{H}(g(K))=\min\{\dim_{H}K,l\}  where g is a continuously differentiable map of rank l. We deduce the same result without any separation condition and we generalize a result of Ero\breve{\mathrm{g}}lu by obtaining that \mathcal{H}^{t}(g(K))=0.
