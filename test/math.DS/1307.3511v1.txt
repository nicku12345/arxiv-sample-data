Irrational numbers of bounded type have several equivalent characterizations. They have bounded partial quotients in terms of arithmetic characterization and in the dynamics of the circle rotation, the rescaled recurrence time to r-ball of the initial point is bounded below. In this paper, we consider how the bounded type condition of irrational is generalized into interval exchange maps.
