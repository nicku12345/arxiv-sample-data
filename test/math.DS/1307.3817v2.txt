A topological dynamical system (X,f) is said to be multi-transitive if for every n\in\mathbb{N} the system (X^{n}, f\times f^{2}\times \dotsb\times f^{n}) is transitive. We introduce the concept of multi-transitivity with respect to a vector and show that multi-transitivity can be characterized by the hitting time sets of open sets, answering a question proposed by Kwietniak and Oprocha [On weak mixing, minimality and weak disjointness of all iterates, Erg. Th. Dynam. Syst., 32 (2012), 1661--1672]. We also show that multi-transitive systems are Li-Yorke chaotic.
