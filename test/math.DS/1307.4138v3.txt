Let (X, f) be a topological dynamical system and \mathcal {F} be a Furstenberg family (a collection of subsets of \mathbb{N} with hereditary upward property). A point x\in X is called an \mathcal {F}-transitive point if for every non-empty open subset U of X the entering time set of x into U, \{n\in \mathbb{N}: f^{n}(x) \in U\}, is in \mathcal {F}; the system (X,f) is called \mathcal {F}-point transitive if there exists some \mathcal {F}-transitive point. In this paper, we first discuss the connection between \mathcal {F}-point transitivity and \mathcal {F}-transitivity, and show that weakly mixing and strongly mixing systems can be characterized by \mathcal {F}-point transitivity, completing results in [Transitive points via Furstenberg family, Topology Appl. 158 (2011), 2221--2231]. We also show that multi-transitivity, \Delta-transitivity and multi-minimality can also be characterized by \mathcal {F}-point transitivity, answering two questions proposed by Kwietniak and Oprocha [On weak mixing, minimality and weak disjointness of all iterates, Erg. Th. Dynam. Syst., 32 (2012), 1661--1672].
