We introduce multifractal zeta-functions providing precise information of a very general class of multifractal spectra, including, for example, the multifractal spectra of self-conformal measures and the multifractal spectra of ergodic Birkhoff averages of continuous functions. More precisely, we prove that these and more general multifractal spectra equal the abscissae of convergence of the associated zetafunctions.
