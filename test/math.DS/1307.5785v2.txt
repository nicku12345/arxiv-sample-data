We consider the dynamical properties of transcendental entire functions and their compositions. We give several conditions under which Fatou set of a transcendental entire function f coincide with that of f\circ g, where g is another transcendental entire function. We also prove some result giving relationship between singular values of transcendental entire functions and their compositions.
