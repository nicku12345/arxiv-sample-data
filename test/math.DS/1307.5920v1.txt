We show that under suitable conditions a random orbit generated by a system of nonexpansive maps recovers an invariant set via its omega-limit. In particular, this explains what happens to the Kaczmarz--von Neumann projection algorithm in the infeasible case, that is, when one deals with more than two affine varieties having empty intersection.
