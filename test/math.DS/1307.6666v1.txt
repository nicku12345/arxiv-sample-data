We consider some planar triangular maps. These maps preserve certain fibration of the plane. We assume that there exists an invariant attracting fiber and we study the limit dynamics of those points in the basin of attraction of this invariant fiber, assuming that either it contains a global attractor, or it is filled by fixed or 2-periodic points. Finally, we apply our results to a variety of examples, from particular cases of triangular systems to some planar quasi-homogeneous maps, and some multiplicative and additive difference equations, as well.
