We use the notion of isomorphism between two invariant vector fields to shed new light on the issue of linearization of an invariant vector field near a relative equilibrium. We argue that the notion is useful in understanding the passage from the space of invariant vector fields in a tube around a group orbit to the space invariant vector fields on a slice to the orbit. The notion comes from Hepworth's study of vector fields on stacks.
