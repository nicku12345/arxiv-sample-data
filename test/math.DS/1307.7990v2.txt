We develop operator renewal theory for flows and apply this to infinite ergodic theory. In particular we obtain results on mixing for a large class of infinite measure semiflows.   Examples of systems covered by our results include suspensions over parabolic rational maps of the complex plane, and nonuniformly expanding semiflows with indifferent periodic orbits. In some cases, we obtain higher order asymptotics and rates of mixing.
