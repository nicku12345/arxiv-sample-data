Given a holomorphic germ at the origin of C with a simple parabolic fixed point, the local dynamics is classically described by means of pairs of attracting and repelling Fatou coordinates and the corresponding pairs of horn maps, of crucial importance for \'Ecalle-Voronin's classification result and the definition of the parabolic renormalization operator. We revisit \'Ecalle's approach to the construction of Fatou coordinates, which relies on Borel-Laplace summation, and give an original and self-contained proof of their resurgent character.
