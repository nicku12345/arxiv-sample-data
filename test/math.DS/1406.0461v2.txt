We discuss the local dynamics of a subgroup of Diff(C^2,0) possessing locally discrete orbits as well as the structure of the recurrent set for more general groups. It is proved, in particular, that a subgroup of Diff(C^2,0) possessing locally discrete orbits must be virtually solvable. These results are of considerable interest in problems concerning integrable systems.
