We consider two families of functions \mathcal{F}=\{f_{{\la},{\xi}}(z)= e^{-z+\la}+\xi: \la,\,\xi\in\C, \RE{\la}<0, \RE\xi\geq 1\} and \mathcal{F}'=\{f_{{\mu},{\ze}}(z)= e^{z+\mu}+\ze: \mu,\,\ze\in\C, \RE{\mu}<0, \RE\ze\leq-1\} and investigate the escaping sets of members of the family \mathcal F and \mathcal F'. We also consider the dynamics of composite entire functions and provide conditions for equality of escaping sets of two transcendental entire functions.
