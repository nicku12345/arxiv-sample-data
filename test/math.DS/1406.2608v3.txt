It is shown that there exist a subsequence for which the multiple ergodic averages of commuting invertible measure preserving transformations of a Lebesgue probability space converge almost everywhere provided that the maps are weakly mixing with an ergodic extra condition. The proof provides a example of non-singular dynamical system for which the maximal ergodic inequality does not hold. We further get that the non-singular strategy to solve the pointwise convergence of the Furstenberg ergodic averages fails.
