It is well known that the linear stability of the Lagrangian elliptic solutions in the classical planar three-body problem depends on a mass parameter \beta and on the eccentricity e of the orbit. We consider only the circular case (e = 0) but under the action of a broader family of singular potentials: \alpha-homogeneous potentials, for \alpha \in (0,2), and the logarithmic one. It turns out indeed that the Lagrangian circular orbit persists also in this more general setting. We discover a region of linear stability expressed in terms of the homogeneity parameter \alpha and the mass parameter \beta, then we compute the Morse index of this orbit and of its iterates and we find that the boundary of the stability region is the envelope of a family of curves on which the Morse indices of the iterates jump. In order to conduct our analysis we rely on a Maslov-type index theory devised and developed by Y.~Long, X.~Hu and S.~Sun; a key role is played by an appropriate index theorem and by some precise computations of suitable Maslov-type indices.
