Let W_{\lambda,b}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\lambda^n g(b^n x) where b\geqslant2 is an integer and g(u)=\cos(2\pi u) (classical Weierstrass function). Building on work by Ledrappier (1992), Bar\'ansky, B\'ar\'any and Romanowska (2013) and Tsujii (2001), we provide an elementary proof that the Hausdorff dimension of W_{\lambda,b} equals 2+\frac{\log\lambda}{\log b} for all \lambda\in(\lambda_b,1) with a suitable \lambda_b<1. This reproduces results by Bar\'ansky, B\'ar\'any and Romanowska without using the dimension theory for hyperbolic measures of Ledrappier and Young (1985,1988), which is replaced by a simple telescoping argument together with a recursive multi-scale estimate.
