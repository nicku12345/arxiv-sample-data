In this paper we analyze a generic dynamical system with \mathbb{D}_2 constructed via a Cayley graph. We study the Hopf bifurcation and find conditions for obtaining a unique branch of periodic solutions. Our main result comes from analyzing the system under weak coupling, where we identify the conditions for heteroclinic cycle between four equilibria in the two-dimensional fixed point subspace of some of the isotropy subgroups of \mathbb{D}_2\times\mathbb{S}^1. We also analyze the stability of the heteroclinic cycle.
