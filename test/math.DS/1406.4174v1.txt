The subject of this paper is to prove a functional weak invariance principle for the local time of a process generated by a Gibbs-Markov map. More precisely, let \left(X,\mathcal{B},m,T,\alpha\right) is a mixing, probability preserving Gibbs-Markov{\normalsize{}. and let \varphi\in L^{2}\left(m\right) be an aperiodic function with mean 0. Set S_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}X_{k} and define the hitting time process L_{n}\left(x\right) be the number of times S_{k} hits x\in\mathbb {Z} up to step n. The normalized local time process l_{n}\left(x\right) is defined by  l_{n}\left(t\right)=\frac{L_{n}\left(\left\lfloor \sqrt{n}x\right\rfloor \right)}{\sqrt{n}},\,\, x\in\mathbb{R}.   We prove under that l_{n}\left(x\right) converges in distribution to the local time of the Brownian Motion. The proof also applies to the more classical setting of local times derived from a subshift of finite type endowed with a Gibbs measure.
