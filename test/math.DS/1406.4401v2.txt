An w-limit set of a continuous self-mapping of a compact metric space X is said to be totally periodic if all of its points are periodic. We say that X has the w-FTP property provided that for each continuous self-mapping f of X, every totally periodic w-limit set is finite. Firstly, we show that connected components of every totally periodic w-limit set are finite. Secondly, for the wide class of one-dimensional continua, we prove that a hereditary locally connected X has the w-FTP property if and only if X is completely regular. This holds in particular for X being a local dendrite with discrete set of branch points, and in particular, for a graph. For higher dimension, we show that any compact metric space X containing a free topological n-ball (n great than 2) does not admit the w-FTP property. This holds in particular, for any topological compact manifold of dimension greater than 1.
