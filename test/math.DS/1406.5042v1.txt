In this paper, let n\geq2 be an integer, P=diag(-I_{n-\kappa},I_\kappa,-I_{n-\kappa},I_\kappa) for some integer \kappa\in[0, n), and \Sigma \subset {\bf R}^{2n} be a partially symmetric compact convex hypersurface, i.e., x\in \Sigma implies Px\in\Sigma. We prove that if \Sigma is (r,R)-pinched with \frac{R}{r}<\sqrt{2}, then there exist at least n-\kappa geometrically distinct P-symmetric closed characteristics on \Sigma, as a consequence, \Sigma carry at least n geometrically distinct P-invariant closed characteristics.
