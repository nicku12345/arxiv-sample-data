Let E, F\subset \R^d be two self-similar sets. Under mild conditions, we show that F can be C^1-embedded into E if and only if it can be affinely embedded into E; furthermore if F can not be affinely embedded into E, then the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection E\cap f(F) is strictly less than that of F for any C^1-diffeomorphism f on \R^d. Under certain circumstances, we prove the logarithmic commensurability between the contraction ratios of E and F if F can be affinely embedded into E. As an application, we show that \dim_HE\cap f(F)<\min\{\dim_HE, \dim_HF\} when E is any Cantor-p set and F any Cantor-q set, where p,q\geq 2 are two integers with \log p/\log q\not \in \Q. This is related to a conjecture of Furtenberg about the intersections of Cantor sets.
