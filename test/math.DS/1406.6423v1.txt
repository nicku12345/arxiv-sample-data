We calculate slow entropy type invariant introduced by A. Katok and J.-P. Thouvenot in [5] for higher rank smooth abelian actions for two leading cases: when the invariant measure is absolutely continuous and when it is hyperbolic. As a by-product, we generalize Brin-Katok local entropy Theorem to the abelian action for the above two cases. We also prove that, for abelian actions, the transversal Hausdorff dimensions are universal, i.e. dependent on the action but not on any individual element of the action.
