Let M be a compact n-dimensional Riemanian manifold, End(M) the set of the endomorphisms of M with the usual \mathcal{C}^0 topology and \phi: M\to\mathbb{R} continuous. We prove that there exists a dense subset of \mathcal{A} of End(M) such that, if f\in\mathcal{A}, there exists a f invariant measure \mu_{\max} supported on a periodic orbit that maximizes the integral of \phi among all f invariant Borel probability measures.
