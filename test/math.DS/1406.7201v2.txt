Given a surface M and a Borel probability measure \nu on the group of C^2-diffeomorphisms of M, we study \nu-stationary probability measures on M. Assuming the positivity of a certain entropy, the following dichotomy is proved: either the stable distributions for the random dynamics is non-random, or the measure is SRB. In the case that \nu-a.e. diffeomorphism preserves a common smooth measure m, we show that for any positive-entropy stationary measure \mu, either there exists a \nu-almost surely invariant \mu-measurable line field (corresponding do the stable distributions for almost every random composition) or the measure \mu is \nu-almost surely invariant and coincides with an ergodic component of m.   To prove the above result, we introduce a skew product with surface fibers over a measure preserving transformation equipped with an increasing sub-\sigma-algebra \hat F. Given an invariant measure \mu for the skew product, and assuming the \hat F-measurability of the `past dynamics' and the fiber-wise conditional measures, we prove a dichotomy: either the fiber-wise stable distributions are measurable with respect to a related increasing sub-\sigma-algebra, or the measure \mu is fiber-wise SRB.
