We construct an increasing sequence of natural numbers (m_n)_{n=1}^{+\infty} with the property that (m_n \th [1])_{n\geq 1} is dense in \T for any \th \in \R\setminus \Q, and a continuous measure on the circle \mu such that \lim_{n\to +\infty}\int_{\T}\|m_n\theta\|d\mu(\theta)=0. Moreover, for every fixed k\in \N, the set \{n\in \N:\,k\nmid m_n \} is infinite.   This is a sufficient condition for the existence of a rigid, weakly mixing dynamical system whose rigidity time is not a rigidity time for any system with a discrete part in its spectrum.
