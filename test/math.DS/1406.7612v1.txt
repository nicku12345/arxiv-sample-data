In this paper we first give the explicit definition of essential perturbation. Secondly, given a perturbation of a particular family of centers of polynomial differential systems of arbitrary degree for which we explicitly know its Poincar\'e--Liapunov constants, we give the structure of its k-th Melnikov function. This result generalizes the result obtained by Chicone and Jacobs for perturbations of degree at most two of any center of a quadratic polynomial system. Moreover we study the essential perturbations for all the centers of the differential systems \[ \dot{x} \, = \, -y + P_{\rm d}(x,y), \quad \dot{y} \, = \, x + Q_{\rm d}(x,y), \] where P_{\rm d} and Q_{\rm d} are homogeneous polynomials of degree {\rm d}, for {\rm d}=2 and {\rm d}=3.
