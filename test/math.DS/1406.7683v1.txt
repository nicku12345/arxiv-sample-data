The main result of this paper is the following version of the real Jacobian conjecture: "Let F=(p,q):\R^2\to\R^2 be a polynomial map with nowhere zero Jacobian determinant. If the degree of p is less than or equal to 4, then F is injective". Assume that two polynomial maps from \R^2 to \R are equivalent when they are the same up to affine changes of coordinates in the source and in the target. We completely classify the polynomial submersions of degree 4 with at least one disconnected level set up to this equivalence, obtaining four classes. Then, analyzing the half-Reeb components of the foliation induced by a representative p of each of these classes, we prove there is not a polynomial q such that the Jacobian determinant of the map (p,q) is nowhere zero. Recalling that the real Jacobian conjecture is true for maps F=(p,q) when all the level sets of p are connected, we conclude the proof of the main result.
