The comparison between time-varying hybrid trajectories is crucial for tracking, observer design and synchronisation problems for hybrid systems with state-triggered jumps. In this paper, a systematic way of designing an appropriate distance function is proposed that can be used for this purpose. The so-called "peaking phenomenon", which occurs when using the Euclidean distance to compare two hybrid trajectories, is circumvented by taking the hybrid nature of the system explicitly into account in the design of the distance function. Based on the proposed distance function, we define the stability of a trajectory of a hybrid system with state-triggered jumps and present sufficient Lyapunov-type conditions for stability of a hybrid trajectory. A constructive design method for the distance function is presented for hybrid systems with affine flow and jump maps and a jump set that is a hyperplane. For this case, the mentioned Lyapunov-type stability conditions can be verified using linear matrix conditions. Finally, for this class of systems, we present a tracking controller that asymptotically stabilises a given hybrid reference trajectory, and we illustrate our results with examples.
