Partial hyperbolicity appeared in the sixties as a natural generaliza- tion of hyperbolicity. In the last 20 years in this area there has been great activity. Here we survey the state of the art in some topics, focusing especially in partial hyperbolicity in dimension 3. The reason for this is not only that it is the smallest dimension in which non-degenerate partial hyperbolicity can occur, but also that the topology of 3-manifolds influences this dynamics in revealing ways.
