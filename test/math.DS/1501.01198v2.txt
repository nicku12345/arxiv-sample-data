Recently, the dynamical and spectral properties of square-free integers, visible lattice points and various generalisations have received increased attention. One reason is the connection of one-dimensional examples such as \mathscr B-free numbers with Sarnak's conjecture on the `randomness' of the M\"obius function, another the explicit computability of correlation functions as well as eigenfunctions for these systems together with intrinsic ergodicity properties. Here, we summarise some of the results, with focus on spectral and dynamical aspects, and expand a little on the implications for mathematical diffraction theory.
