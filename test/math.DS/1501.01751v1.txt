Given a finite-to-one factor code \pi: X \to Y between irreducible sofic shifts and an ergodic \nu on Y with full support, it is known that the fiber \pi^{-1}_*(\nu) has at most d_\pi ergodic measures in it where d_\pi is the degree of \pi. We introduce the notion of multiplicity for ergodic measures on X (that depends on \pi) and we prove that d_\pi is the sum of the multiplicity of \mu where \mu runs over the ergodic measures in \pi^{-1}_*(\nu). We also build an appropriate generalization to infinite-to-one factor codes in relation to class degree and relatively maximal measures. We also define the notion of degree joining (for finite-to-one factor codes) and class degree joining (for infinite-to-one factor codes) which are the main tool for establishing our results
