We define class-closing factor codes from shifts of finite type and show that they are continuing if their images are of finite type. We establish several relations between class-closing factor codes, continuing factor codes and constant-class-to-one factor codes. In particular it is shown that a factor code between irreducible shifts of finite type is constant-class-to-one if and only if it is bi-class-closing, generalizing a result of Nasu.
