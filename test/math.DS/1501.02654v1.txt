This paper is concerned with the stickiness of invariant tori obtained by KAM technics (so-called KAM tori) for higher dimensional beam equation. We prove that the KAM tori are sticky, i.e. the solutions starting in the \delta-neighborhood of KAM torus still stay close to the KAM torus for a polynomial long time such as |t|\leq \delta^{-\mathcal{M}} with any \mathcal{M}\geq 0, by constructing a partial normal form of higher order, which satisfies p-tame property, around the KAM torus.
