The joint spectral radius of a pair of 2x2 real matrices (A_0,A_1)\in M_2(\mathbb{R})^2 is defined to be r(A_0,A_1)= \limsup_{n\to\infty} \max \{\|A_{i_1}...A_{i_n}\|^{1/n}: i_j\in\{0,1\}\}, the optimal growth rate of the norm of products of these matrices. The Lagarias-Wang finiteness conjecture, asserting that r(A_0,A_1) is always the nth root of the spectral radius of some length-n product A_{i_1}...A_{i_n}, has been refuted by Bousch & Mairesse, with subsequent counterexamples presented by Blondel, Theys & Vladimirov; Kozyakin; Hare, Morris, Sidorov & Theys. In this article we introduce a new approach to generating finiteness counterexamples, and use this to exhibit an open subset of M_2(\mathbb{R})^2 with the property that each member (A_0,A_1) of the subset generates uncountably many counterexamples of the form (A_0, tA_1). Our methods employ ergodic theory, in particular the analysis of Sturmian invariant measures; this approach allows a short proof that the relation between the parameter t and the Sturmian parameter P(t) is a devil's staircase.
