The paper is devoted to generic translation flows corresponding to Abelian differentials with one zero of order two on flat surfaces of genus two. These flows are weakly mixing by the Avila-Forni theorem. Our main result gives first quantitative estimates on their spectrum, establishing the Hoelder property for the spectral measures of Lipschitz functions. The proof proceeds via uniform estimates of twisted Birkhoff integrals in the symbolic framework of random Markov compacta and arguments of Diophantine nature in the spirit of Salem, Erdos and Kahane.
