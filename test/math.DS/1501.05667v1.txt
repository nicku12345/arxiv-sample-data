The main objective of this talk is to develop a matrix pencil approach for the study of an initial value problem of a class of singular linear matrix differential equations whose coefficients are constant matrices. By using matrix pencil theory we study the cases of non square matrices and of square matrices with an identically zero matrix pencil. Furthermore we will give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions and we will see when the uniqueness of solutions is not valid. Moreover we provide a numerical example.
