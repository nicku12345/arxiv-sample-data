After the nice result introduced by Belotto in [1] concerning the local monomialization of a singular foliation given by n first integrals, this work is a continuation in the same spirit. In this paper, we introduce a important conjecture about local monomialization of a singular foliation of Darboux type (see section 1). This conjecture can be used to study pseudo-abelian integrals [2,4].
