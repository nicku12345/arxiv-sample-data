We describe a family \phi_{\lambda} of dynamical systems on the unit interval which preserve Bernoulli convolutions. We show that if there are parameter ranges for which these systems are piecewise convex, then the corresponding Bernoulli convolution will be absolutely continuous with bounded density. We study the systems \phi_{\lambda} and give some numerical evidence to suggest values of \lambda for which \phi_{\lambda} may be piecewise convex.
