We address the problem of understanding the dynamics around typical singular points of 3D piecewise smooth vector fields. A model Z_0 in 3D presenting a T-singularity is considered and a complete picture of its dynamics is obtained in the following way: \textit{(i)} Z_0 has an invariant plane \pi_0 filled up with periodic orbits (this means that the restriction Z_0 |_{\pi_0} is a center around the singularity), \textit{(ii)} All trajectories of Z_0 converge to the surface \pi_0, and such attraction occurs in a very non-usual and amazing way, \textit{(iii)} given an arbitrary integer k\geq 0 then Z_0 can be approximated by \pi_0-invariant piecewise smooth vector fields Z_{\varepsilon} such that the restriction Z_{\varepsilon} |_{\pi_0} has exactly k-hyperbolic limit cycles, \textit{(iv)} the origin can be chosen as an asymptotic stable equilibrium of Z_{\varepsilon} when k=0, and finally, \textit{(v)} Z_0 has infinite codimension in the set of all 3D piecewise smooth vector fields.
