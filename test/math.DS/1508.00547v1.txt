Among Thurston maps (orientation-preserving, postcritically finite branched coverings of the 2-sphere to itself), those that arise as subdivision maps of a finite subdivision rule form a special family. For such maps, we investigate relationships between various notions of expansion---combinatorial, dynamical, algebraic, and coarse-geometric.
