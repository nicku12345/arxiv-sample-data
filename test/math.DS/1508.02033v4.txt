Let f be a C^{2+\epsilon} expanding map of the circle and v be a C^{1+\epsilon} real function of the circle. Consider the twisted cohomological equation v(x) = \alpha (f(x)) - Df(x) \alpha (x) which has a unique bounded solution \alpha. We prove that \alpha is either C^{1+\epsilon} or nowhere differentiable, and if \alpha is nowhere differentiable then the Newton quotients of \alpha, after an appropriated normalization, converges in distribution to the normal distribution, with respect to the unique absolutely continuous invariant probability of f.
