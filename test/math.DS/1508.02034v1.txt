We examine several definitions of soficity for monoids obtained by generalizing various definitions of sofic groups. They are not all equivalent and include the definition recently introduced by Ceccherini-Silberstein and Coornaert. One of these definitions readily generalizes to semigroups (albeit in an arguably unsatisfying way), thus addressing a question asked by Kambites. We conclude by proposing a definition of soficity for a general dynamical system consisting of a semigroup acting by measure-preserving transformations on a probability space.
