We prove that for a generic skew product with circle fiber over an Anosov diffeomorphism the Milnor attractor (also called the likely limit set) coincides with the statistical attractor, is Lyapunov stable, and either has zero Lebesgue measure or coincides with the whole phase space. As a consequence we conclude that such skew product is either transitive or has non-wandering set of zero measure. The result is proved under the assumption that the fiber maps preserve the orientation of the circle, and the skew product is partially hyperbolic.
