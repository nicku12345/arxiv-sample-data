We consider a piecewise smooth system in the neighborhood of a co-dimension 2 discontinuity manifold \Sigma. Within the class of Filippov solutions, if \Sigma is attractive, one should expect solution trajectories to slide on \Sigma. It is well known, however, that the classical Filippov convexification methodology is ambiguous on \Sigma. The situation is further complicated by the possibility that, regardless of how sliding on \Sigma is taking place, during sliding motion a trajectory encounters so-called generic first order exit points, where \Sigma ceases to be attractive.   In this work, we attempt to understand what behavior one should expect of a solution trajectory near \Sigma when \Sigma is attractive, what to expect when \Sigma ceases to be attractive (at least, at generic exit points), and finally we also contrast and compare the behavior of some regularizations proposed in the literature.   Through analysis and experiments we will confirm some known facts, and provide some important insight: (i) when \Sigma is attractive, a solution trajectory indeed does remain near \Sigma, viz. sliding on \Sigma is an appropriate idealization (of course, in general, one cannot predict which sliding vector field should be selected); (ii) when \Sigma loses attractivity (at first order exit conditions), a typical solution trajectory leaves a neighborhood of \Sigma; (iii) there is no obvious way to regularize the system so that the regularized trajectory will remain near \Sigma as long as \Sigma is attractive, and so that it will be leaving (a neighborhood of) \Sigma when \Sigma looses attractivity.   We reach the above conclusions by considering exclusively the given piecewise smooth system, without superimposing any assumption on what kind of dynamics near \Sigma (or sliding motion on \Sigma) should have been taking place.
