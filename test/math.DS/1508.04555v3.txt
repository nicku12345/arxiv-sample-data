In this article, we prove that for many complex one-dimensional families of transcendental entire functions, every non-persistent parabolic parameter is the landing point of a local piece of a periodic parameter ray, in the spirit of well-known results about the Mandelbrot set and the exponential parameter space. In fact, we deduce this from a more general local result about a one-dimensional family of holomorphic maps.
