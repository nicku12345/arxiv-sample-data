Ecological modelling of increasingly more complex microbial populations is necessary to reflect the highly functional and diverse behaviour inherent to many systems found in reality. Anaerobic digestion is one such process that has benefitted from the application of mathematical analysis not only for characterising the biological dynamics, but also to investigate emergent behaviour not apparent by simulation alone. Nevertheless, the standard modelling approach has been to describe biological systems using sets of differential equations whose kinetics are generally described by some empirically derived function of growth. The drawbacks of this are two-fold; the growth functions are derived from empirical studies that may not be representative of the system to be modelled and whose parameters may not have a mechanistic meaning, and mathematical analysis is restricted by a conformity to an assumption of the dynamics. Here, we attempt to address these challenges by investigating a generalised form of a three-tier chlorophenol mineralising food-web previously only analysed numerically. We examine the existence and stability of the identified steady-states and find that, without a decay term, the system may be characterised analytically. However, it is necessary to perform numerical analysis for the case when maintenance is included, but in both cases we verify the discovery of two important phenomena; i) the washout steady-state is always stable, and ii) the two other steady-states can be unstable according to the initial conditions and operating parameters.
