We consider a family of Pomeau-Manneville type interval maps T_\alpha, parametrized by \alpha \in (0,1), with the unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measures \nu_\alpha, and rate of correlations decay n^{1-1/\alpha}. We show that despite the absence of a spectral gap for all \alpha \in (0,1) and despite nonsummable correlations for \alpha \geq 1/2, the map \alpha \mapsto \int \varphi \, d\nu_\alpha is continuously differentiable for \varphi \in L^{q}[0,1] for q sufficiently large.
