We consider the finiteness problem for central configurations of the n-body problem. We prove that, for n\geq4, there exists a (Zariski) closed subset B in the mass space \mathbb{R}^{n}, such that if (m_1,...,m_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus B, then there is a finite number of corresponding classes of (n-2)-dimensional central configurations for potential associated to a semi-integer exponent. Also, we obtain trilinear homogeneous polynomial equations of degree 3 for central configurations of fixed dimension and, for each integer k \geq 1, we show that the set of mutual distances associated to a k-dimensional central configuration is contained in a determinantal algebraic set.
