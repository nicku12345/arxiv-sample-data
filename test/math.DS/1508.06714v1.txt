Let \Diff^{ r}_m(M) be the set of C^{ r} volume-preserving diffeomorphisms on a compact Riemannian manifold M (\dim M\geq 2). In this paper, we prove that the diffeomorphisms without zero Lyapunov exponents on a set of positive volume are C^1 dense in \Diff^{ r}_m(M), r\geq 1. We also prove a weaker result for symplectic diffeomorphisms \mathcal{S}ym^{r}_{\omega}(M), r\geq1  saying that the symplectic diffeomorphisms with non-zero Lyapunov exponents on a set of positive volume are C^1 dense in \mathcal{S}ym^{r}_{\omega}(M), r\geq1 .
