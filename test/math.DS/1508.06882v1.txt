In this survey paper, we take the viewpoint of polar invariants to the local and global study of non-dicritical holomorphic foliations in dimension two and their invariant curves. It appears a characterization of second type foliations and generalized curve foliations as well as a description of the GSV-index in terms of polar curves. We also interpret the proofs concerning the Poincar\'e problem with polar invariants.
