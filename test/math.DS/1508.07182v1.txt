In this work we present a novel framework for the computation of finite dimensional invariant sets of infinite dimensional dynamical systems. It extends a classical subdivision technique [Dellnitz/Hohmann 1997] for the computation of such objects of finite dimensional systems to the infinite dimensional case by utilizing results on embedding techniques for infinite dimensional systems. We show how to implement this approach for the analysis of delay differential equations and illustrate the feasibility of our implementation by computing invariant sets for three different delay differential equations.
