The dynamics of the family of maps \displaystyle{f_{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta}(z)=\frac{\alpha z + \beta}{\gamma z^2 +\delta z}} in complex plane is investigated computationally. This dynamical system z_{n+1}=f_{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta}(z_n)=\frac{\alpha z_n + \beta}{\gamma z_n^2 +\delta z_n} has periodic solutions with higher periods which was absent in the real line scenario. It is also found that there are chaotic fractal and non-fractal like solutions of the dynamical systems. A few special cases of parameters are also have been taken care.
