Age at infection is often an important factor in epidemic dynamics. In this paper a disease transmission model of SIS type with age dependent infection on a heterogeneous network is discussed. The model allows the infectious rate and the recovery rate to vary and depend on the age of the infected individual at the time of infection. We address the threshold property of the basic reproduction number and present the global dynamical properties of the disease-free and endemic equilibria in the model. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the main results. The combined effects of the network structure and the age dependent factor on the disease dynamics are displayed.
