The aim of this short note is to explain how the arguments of the "closing lemma with time control" of F. Abdenur and S. Crovisier (arXiv:1111.4206) can be used to answer Question 1 of the article "Instability for the rotation set of homeomorphisms of the torus homotopic to the identity" of S. Addas-Zanata.
