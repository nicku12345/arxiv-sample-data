Quantization for probability distributions concerns the best approximation of a d-dimensional probability distribution P by a discrete probability with a given number n of supporting points. In this paper, an infinitely generated nonhomogeneous Borel probability measure P is considered on \mathbb R. For such a probability measure P, an induction formula to determine the optimal sets of n-means and the nth quantization error for every natural number n is given. In addition, using the induction formula we give some results and observations about the optimal sets of n-means for all n\geq 2.
