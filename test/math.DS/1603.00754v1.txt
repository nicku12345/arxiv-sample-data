Let X\subset A^{Z^d} be a 2-dimensional subshift of finite type. We prove that any 2-dimensional multidimensional subshift of finite type can be characterized by a square matrix of infinite dimension. We extend our result to a general d-dimensional case. We prove that the multidimensional shift space is non-empty if and only if the matrix obtained is of positive dimension. In the process, we give an alternative view of the necessary and sufficient conditions obtained for the non-emptiness of the multidimensional shift space. We also give sufficient conditions for the shift space X to exhibit periodic points.
