Let f be a germ of holomorphic diffeomorphism with an irrationally indifferent fixed point at the origin in \mathbb{C} (i.e. f(0) = 0, f'(0) = e^{2\pi i \alpha}, \alpha \in \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}). Perez-Marco showed the existence of a unique continuous monotone one-parameter family of nontrivial invariant full continua containing the fixed point called Siegel compacta, and gave a correspondence between germs and families (g_t) of circle maps obtained by conformally mapping the complement of these compacts to the complement of the unit disk. The family of circle maps (g_t) is the orbit of a locally-defined semigroup (\Phi_t) on the space of analytic circle maps which we show has a well-defined infinitesimal generator X. The explicit form of X is obtained by using the Loewner equation associated to the family of hulls (K_t). We show that the Loewner measures (\mu_t) driving the equation are 2-conformal measures on the circle for the circle maps (z \mapsto \overline{g_t(\overline{z})}).
