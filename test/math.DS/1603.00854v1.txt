We answer the question if the continuous product of square matrices M(t) over t\in [0,1] can be correctly defined. The case where all M(t) are taken from a finite set \Sigma is studied. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on \Sigma that ensure the convergence of products M(t_{0}=0)M(t_{1})\dots M(t_{N}=1) as the partition 0<t_{1}<\dots<1 refines. These conditions are properties LCP (left convergent product) and RCP (right convergent product) of the set \Sigma. That is, it suffices to require the convergence of all finite products M_{1}M_{2}\dots M_{K} and M_{K}\dots M_{2}M_{1} as K\to\infty, where M_{i}\in\Sigma. The theory of joint spectral radius is heavily used.
