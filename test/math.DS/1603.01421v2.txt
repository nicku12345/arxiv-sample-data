For H\"older continuous cocycles over an invertible, Lipschitz base, we establish the H\"older continuity of Oseledets subspaces on compact sets of arbitrarily large measure. This extends a result of Ara\'{u}jo, Bufetov, and Filip by considering possibly noninvertible cocycles, which in addition may take values in the space of compact operators on a Hilbert space. As a by-product of our work, we also show that a noninvertible cocycle with nonvanishing Lyapunov exponents exhibits nonuniformly hyperbolic behaviour (in the sense of Pesin) on a set of full measure.
