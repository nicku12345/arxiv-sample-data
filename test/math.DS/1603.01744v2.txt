Given a finite irreducible set of real d \times d matrices A_1,\ldots,A_M and a real parameter s>0, there exists a unique shift-invariant equilibrium state associated to (A_1,\ldots,A_M,s). In this article we characterise the ergodic properties of such equilibrium states in terms of the algebraic properties of the semigroup generated by the associated matrices. We completely characterise when the equilibrium state has zero entropy, when it gives distinct Lyapunov exponents to the natural cocycle generated by A_1,\ldots,A_M, and when it is a Bernoulli measure. We also give a general sufficient condition for the equilibrium state to be mixing, and give an example where the equilibrium state is ergodic but not totally ergodic. Connections with a class of measures investigated by S. Kusuoka are explored in an appendix.
