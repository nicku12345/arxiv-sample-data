In this paper we consider the one dimensional spring-block model describing earthquake faulting. By using geometric singular perturbation theory and the blow-up method we provide a detailed description of the periodicity of the earthquake episodes. In particular, the limit cycles arise from a degenerate Hopf bifurcation whose degeneracy is due to an underlying Hamiltonian structure that leads to large amplitude oscillations. We use a Poincar\'e compactification to study the system near infinity. At infinity the critical manifold loses hyperbolicity with an exponential rate. We use an adaptation of the blow-up method to recover the hyperbolicity. This enables the identification of a new attracting manifold that organises the dynamics at infinity. This in turn leads to the formulation of a conjecture on the behaviour of the limit cycles as the time-scale separation increases. We illustrate our findings with numerics and suggest an outline of the proof of this conjecture.
