Dan Rudolph showed that for an amenable group \Gamma, the generic measure-preserving action of \Gamma on a Lebesgue space has zero entropy. Here this is extended to nonamenable groups. In fact, the proof shows that every action is a factor of a zero entropy action! This uses the strange phenomena that in the presence of nonamenability, entropy can increase under a factor map. The proof uses Seward's recent generalization of Sinai's Factor Theorem, the Gaboriau-Lyons result and my theorem that for every nonabelian free group, all Bernoulli shifts factor onto each other.
