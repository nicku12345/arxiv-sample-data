For some one-dimensional discrete-time autonomous population models, local stability implies global stability of the positive equilibrismo point. One of the known techniques is the enveloping method. In this paper we extend the enveloping method to one single periodic population models. We show that, under certain conditions, "individual enveloping" implies "periodic enveloping" in one-dimensional periodic population models.
