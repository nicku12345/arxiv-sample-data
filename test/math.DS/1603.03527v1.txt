For billiards with N obstacles on a torus, we study the behavior of specific kind of its trajectories, \emph{the so called admissible trajectories}. Using the methods developed in \cite{1}, we prove that the \emph{admissible rotation set} is convex, and the periodic trajectories of admissible type are dense in the admissible rotation set. In addition, we show that the admissible rotation set is a proper subset of the general rotation set.
