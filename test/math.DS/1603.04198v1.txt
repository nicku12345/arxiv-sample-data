For a transitive countably piecewise monotone Markov interval map we consider the question whether there exists a conjugate map of constant slope. The answer varies depending on whether the map is continuous or only piecewise continuous, whether it is mixing or not, what slope we consider, and whether the conjugate map is defined on a bounded interval, half-line or the whole real line (with the infinities included).
