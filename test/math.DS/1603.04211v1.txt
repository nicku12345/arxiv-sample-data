The Fibonacci sequence \mathbb{F} is the fixed point beginning with a of morphism \sigma(a,b)=(ab,a). In this paper, we get the explicit expressions of all squares and cubes, then we determine the number of distinct squares and cubes in \mathbb{F}[1,n] for all n, where \mathbb{F}[1,n] is the prefix of \mathbb{F} of length n. By establishing and discussing the recursive structure of squares and cubes, we give algorithms for counting the number of repeated squares and cubes in \mathbb{F}[1,n] for all n, and get explicit expressions for some special n such as n=f_m (the Fibonacci number) etc., which including some known results such as in A.S.Fraenkel and J.Simpson, J.Shallit et al.
