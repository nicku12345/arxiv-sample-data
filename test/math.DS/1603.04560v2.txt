A theoretical analysis of two- and three-dimensional fractional-order Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal models is presented, focusing on stability properties and occurrence of Hopf bifurcations, with respect to the fractional order of the system chosen as bifurcation parameter. With the aim of exemplifying and validating the theoretical results, numerical simulations are also undertaken, which reveal rich bursting behavior in the three-dimensional fractional-order slow-fast system.
