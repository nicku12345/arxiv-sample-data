In this paper we study properties of endomorphisms of \mathbb P^k using a symmetric product construction (\mathbb P^1)^k/\mathfrak{S}_k \cong \mathbb P^k. Symmetric products have been used to produce examples of endomorphisms of \mathbb P^k with certain characteristics, k\geq2. In the present note, we discuss the use of these maps to enlighten arithmetic phenomena and stability phenomena in parameter spaces. In particular, we study notions of uniform boundedness of rational preperiodic points via good reduction information, k-deep postcritically finite maps, and characterize families of Latt\`es maps.
