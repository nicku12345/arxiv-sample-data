We consider semiflows in general Banach spaces motivated by monotone cyclic feedback systems or differential equations with integer-valued Lyapunov functionals. These semiflows enjoy strong monotonicity properties with respect to cones of high ranks, which imply order-related structures on the \omega-limit sets of precompact semi-orbits. We show that for a pseudo-ordered precompact semi-orbit the \omega-limit set \Omega is either ordered, or is contained in the set of equilibria, or possesses a certain ordered homoclinic property. In particular, we show that if \Omega contains no equilibrium, then \Omega itself is ordered and hence the dynamics of the semiflow on \Omega is topologically conjugate to a compact flow on \mathbb{R}^k with k being the rank. We also establish a Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson type Theorem in the case where k=2. All our results are established without the smoothness condition on the semiflow, allowing applications to such cellular or physiological feedback systems with piecewise linear vector fields and to such infinite dimensional systems where the C^1-Closing Lemma or smooth manifold theory has not been developed.
