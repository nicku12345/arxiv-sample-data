Suppose that a closed surface S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3 is an attractor, not necessarily global, for a discrete dynamical system. Assuming that its set of wild points W is totally disconnected, we prove that (up to an ambient homeomorphism) it has to be contained in a straight line. Using this result and a modification of the classical construction of a wild sphere due to Antoine we show that there exist uncountably many different 2--spheres in \mathbb{R}^3 none of which can be realized as an attractor for a homeomorphism.
