We consider here the family of semilinear parabolic problems \begin{equation*} \begin{array}{rcl} \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} u_t(x,t)&=&\Delta u(x,t) -au(x,t) + f(u(x,t)) ,\,\,\ x \in \Omega_\epsilon \,\,\,\mbox{and}\,\,\,\,\,\,t>0\,, \\ \displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial N}(x,t)&=&g(u(x,t)), \,\, x \in \partial\Omega_\epsilon \,\,\,\mbox{and}\,\,\,\,\,\,t>0\,, \end{array} \right. \end{array} \end{equation*} where  {\Omega}  is the unit square, \Omega_{\epsilon}=h_{\epsilon}(\Omega) and h_{\epsilon} is a family of diffeomorphisms converging to the identity in the C^1-norm. We show that the problem is well posed for \epsilon>0 sufficiently small in a suitable phase space, the associated semigroup has a global attractor \mathcal{A}_{\epsilon} and the family \{\mathcal{A}_{\epsilon}\} is continuous at \epsilon = 0.
