A virus dynamics model with intracellular state-dependent delay and nonlinear infection rate of Beddington-DeAngelis functional response is studied. The technique of Lyapunov functionals is used to analyze stability of an interior infection equilibrium which describes the case of both CTL and antibody immune responses activated. We consider first a particular biologically motivated class of discrete state-dependent delays. Next, the general case is investigated.
