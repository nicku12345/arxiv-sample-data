How is it possible to read the dynamical properties (ie when the time goes to infinity) of a system on numerical simulations? To try to answer this question, we study in this manuscript a model reflecting what happens when the orbits of a discrete time system f (for example an homeomorphism) are computed numerically . The computer working in finite numerical precision, it will replace f by a spacial discretization of f, denoted by f_N (where the order N of discretization stands for the numerical accuracy). In particular, we will be interested in the dynamical behaviour of the finite maps f_N for a generic system f and N going to infinity, where generic will be taken in the sense of Baire (mainly among sets of homeomorphisms or C^1-diffeomorphisms).   The first part of this manuscript is devoted to the study of the dynamics of the discretizations f_N, when f is a generic conservative/dissipative homeomorphism of a compact manifold. We show that it would be mistaken to try to recover the dynamics of f from that of a single discretization f_N : its dynamics strongly depends on the order N. To detect some dynamical features of f, we have to consider all the discretizations f_N when N goes through \mathbf N.   The second part deals with the linear case, which plays an important role in the study of C^1-generic diffeomorphisms, discussed in the third part of this manuscript. Under these assumptions, we obtain results similar to those established in the first part, though weaker and harder to prove.
