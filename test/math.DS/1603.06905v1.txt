Topological conjugateness of one dimensional unimodal dynamical systems, which are generated by interval [0, 1] into itself maps are studied. We study the smoothness and differentiability of the conjugacy of symmetrical and non-symmetrical tent maps. Also weprove the extremal property of the length of the graph of the conjugacy of symmetrical and non-symmetrical tent maps.
