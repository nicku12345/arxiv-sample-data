Let F: R^n -> R^n be a C^\infty map such that DF(x) is invertible for all x in R^n. We know that F is a local diffeomorphism but, in general, it is not globally injective. We discuss the relations between some additional hypothesis that guarantee the global injectivity of F. Further, based on one of these hypotheses, we establish a necessary condition for the existence of F: R^n -> R^n such that det DF = h, where h: R^n -> [0,\infty) is a given C^\infty function.
