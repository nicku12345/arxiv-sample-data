We consider the dynamical properties of C^{\infty}-variations of the flow on an aperiodic Kuperberg plug {\mathbb K}. Our main result is that there exists a smooth 1-parameter family of plugs {\mathbb K}_{\epsilon} for \epsilon \in (-a,a) and a<1, such that: (1) The plug {\mathbb K}_0 = {\mathbb K} is a generic Kuperberg plug; (2) For \epsilon <0, the flow in the plug {\mathbb K}_{\epsilon} has two periodic orbits that bound an invariant cylinder, all other orbits of the flow are wandering, and the flow has topological entropy zero; (3) For \epsilon > 0, the flow in the plug {\mathbb K}_{\epsilon} has positive topological entropy, and an abundance of periodic orbits.
