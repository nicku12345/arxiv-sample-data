We address the classical problem of equivalence between Kolmogorov and Bernoulli property of smooth dynamical systems. In a natural class of volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms homotopic to Anosov ("derived from Anosov") on 3-torus, we prove that Kolmogorov and Bernoulli properties are equivalent.   In our approach, we propose to study the conditional measures of volume along central foliation to recover fine ergodic properties for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. As an important consequence we obtain that there exists an almost everywhere conjugacy between any volume preserving derived from Anosov diffeomorphism of 3-torus and its linearization.   Our results also hold in higher dimensional case when central bundle is one dimensional and stable and unstable foliations are quasi-isometric.
