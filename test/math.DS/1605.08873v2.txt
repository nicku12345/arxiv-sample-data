The theorem of Le Calvez and Yoccoz states that there are no minimal homeomorphisms on the finite punctered 2-dimensional sphere S 2 . We show that this does not hold for other surfaces. Moreover, we discuss why the fast-conjugation-method fails in the most cases to construct such homeomorphisms. This article based on an old unpublished article (Quasi-Minimal, Pseudo-Minimal Systems and Dense Orbits) with incorrect results.
