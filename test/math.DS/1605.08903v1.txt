In this paper we discuss the dynamical structure of the rational family (f_t) given by f_t(z)=tz^{m}\Big(\frac{1-z}{1+z}\Big)^{n}\quad(m\ge 2,~t\ne 0). Each map f_t has two super-attracting immediate basins and two free critical points. We prove that for 0<|t|\le 1 and |t|\ge 1, either of these basins is completely invariant and at least one of the free critical points is inactive. Based on this separation we draw a detailed picture the structure of the dynamical and the parameter plane.
