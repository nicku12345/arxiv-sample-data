This paper is an extension of an earlier paper that dealt with global dynamics in autonomous triangular maps. In the current paper, we extend the results on global dynamics of autonomous triangular maps to periodic non-autonomous triangular maps. We show that, under certain conditions, the orbit of every point in a periodic non-autonomous triangular map converges to a fixed point (respectively, periodic orbit of period p) if and only if there is no periodic orbit of prime period two (respectively, periodic orbits of prime period greater than p).
