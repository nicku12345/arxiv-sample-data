Downarowicz and Maass (2008) have defined the topological rank for all Cantor minimal homeomorphisms. On the other hand, Gambaudo and Martens (2006) have expressed all Cantor minimal continuous surjections as the inverse limits of certain graph coverings. Using the aforementioned results, we previously extended the notion of topological rank to all Cantor minimal continuous surjections. In this paper, we show that taking natural extensions of Cantor minimal continuous surjections does not increase their topological ranks. Further, we apply the result to the minimal symbolic case.
