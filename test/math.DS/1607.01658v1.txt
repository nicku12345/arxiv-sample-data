We consider a map of the unit square which is not 1--1, such as the memory map studied in \cite{MwM1}. Memory maps are defined as follows: x_{n+1}=M_{\alpha}(x_{n-1},x_{n})=\tau (\alpha \cdot x_{n}+(1-\alpha )\cdot x_{n-1}), where \tau is a one-dimensional map on I=[0,1] and 0<\alpha <1 determines how much memory is being used. In this paper we let \tau  to be the symmetric tent map. To study the dynamics of M_\alpha, we consider the two-dimensional map  G_{\alpha }:[x_{n-1},x_{n}]\mapsto [x_{n},\tau (\alpha \cdot x_{n}+(1-\alpha )\cdot x_{n-1})]\, . The map G_\alpha for \alpha\in(0,3/4] was studied in \cite{MwM1}. In this paper we prove that for \alpha\in(3/4,1) the map G_\alpha admits a singular Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure. We do this by applying Rychlik's results for the Lozi map. However, unlike the Lozi map, the maps G_\alpha are not invertible which creates complications that we are able to overcome.
