This paper is devoted to study the topological invariance of several non-uniform hyperbolicity conditions of one-dimensional maps. In contrast with the case of maps with only one critical point, it is known that for maps with several critical points the Collet-Eckmann condition is not in itself invariance under topological conjugacy. We show that the Collet-Eckmann condition together with any of several slow recurrence conditions is invariant under topological conjugacy. This extends and gives a new proof of a result by Luzzatto and Wang that also applies to the complex setting.
