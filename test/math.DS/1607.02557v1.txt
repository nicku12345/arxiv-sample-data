In this paper we consider a smooth flow (\Lambda,\Phi^t) builded from suspending over a (non-invertible topologically mixing) subshift of finite type, and we equip it with an equilibrium measure \nu on \Lambda. The two main theorems are a large deviation and an escape rate result. The first theorem gives an explicit formula for X>0 and Y such that \nu\left\{x\in\Lambda: \left|\int F\circ \Phi^s (x) ds-\int F d\mu\right|>\epsilon\right\}\leq \exp(-Xt+\log t+Y) for t\gg>1\gg\epsilon>0, where F:\Lambda\to\mathbb{R} is smooth. The second theorem gives an explicit lower bound for the asymptotic behaviour of the escape rate of \nu through a small hole.
