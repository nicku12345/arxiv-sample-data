We study the smoothness of the stationary measure with respect to smooth perturbations of the iterated function scheme and the weight functions that define it. Our main theorems relate the smoothness of the perturbation of: the iterated function scheme and the weight functions; to the smoothness of the perturbation of the stationary measure. The results depend on the smoothness of: the iterated function scheme and the weights functions; and the space on which the stationary measure acts as a linear operator. As a consequence we also obtain the smoothness of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and of the Hausdorff dimension of the stationary measure.
