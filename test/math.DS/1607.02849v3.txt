Let s\in (0,1), and let F\subset \mathbb{R} be a self similar set such that 0 < \dim_H F \leq s . We prove that there exists \delta= \delta(s) >0 such that if F admits an affine embedding into a homogeneous self similar set E and 0 \leq \dim_H E - \dim_H F < \delta then (under some mild conditions on E and F) the contraction ratios of E and F are logarithmically commensurable. This provides more evidence for a Conjecture of Feng, Huang, and Rao, that states that these contraction ratios are logarithmically commensurable whenever F admits an affine embedding into E (under some mild conditions). Our method is a combination of an argument based on the approach of Feng, Huang, and Rao, with a new result by Hochman, which is related to the increase of entropy of measures under convolutions.
