In this article we develop an analogue of Aubry-Mather theory for a class of dissipative systems, namely conformally symplectic systems, and prove the existence of interesting invariant sets, which, in analogy to the conservative case, will be called the Aubry and the Mather sets. Besides describing their structure and their dynamical significance, we shall analyze their attracting/repelling properties, as well as their noteworthy role in driving the asymptotic dynamics of the system.
