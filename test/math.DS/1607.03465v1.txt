For continuous maps of compact metric spaces f:X\to X and g:Y\to Y and for various notions of topological recurrence, we study the relationship between recurrence for f and g and recurrence for the product map f\times g:X\times Y \to X\times Y. For the generalized recurrent set GR, we see that GR(f\times g)=GR(f)\times GR(g). For the nonwandering set NW, we see that NW(f\times g)\subset NW(f)\times NW(g) and give necessary and sufficient conditions on f for equality for every g. We also consider product recurrence for the chain recurrent set, the strong chain recurrent set, and the Ma\~n\'e set.
