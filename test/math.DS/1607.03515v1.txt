The structure of the set of local dimensions of a self-similar measure has been studied by numerous mathematicians, initially for measures that satisfy the open set condition and, more recently, for measures on \mathbb{R} that are of finite type.   In this paper, our focus is on finite type measures defined on the torus, the quotient space \mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Z}. We give criteria which ensures that the set of local dimensions of the measure taken over points in special classes generates an interval. We construct a non-trivial example of a measure on the torus that admits an isolated point in its set of local dimensions. We prove that the set of local dimensions for a finite type measure that is the quotient of a self-similar measure satisfying the strict separation condition is an interval. We show that sufficiently many convolutions of Cantor-like measures on the torus never admit an isolated point in their set of local dimensions, in stark contrast to such measures on \mathbb{R}. Further, we give a family of Cantor-like measures on the torus where the set of local dimensions is a strict subset of the set of local dimensions, excluding the isolated point, of the corresponding measures on \mathbb{R}.
