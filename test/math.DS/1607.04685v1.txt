An important class of `physically relevant' measures for dynamical systems with hyperbolic behavior is given by Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measures. We survey various techniques for constructing SRB measures and studying their properties, paying special attention to the geometric `push-forward' approach. After describing this approach in the uniformly hyperbolic setting, we review recent work that extends it to non-uniformly hyperbolic systems.
