Take G a locally compact second-countable group, and H a subgroup of G. Choose \mu a probability measure on G, such that the group spanned by its support is dense in G, and consider the Markov chain on the homogeneous space X=G/H with transition probability P_x=\mu *\delta_x for x\in X. Under some conditions on G, H, \mu, we know that this Markov chain is either everywhere recurrent or everywhere transient. A natural question is whether such a dichotomy is universally true. The goal of this paper is to show it is not, even when G is finitely generated, through the explicit construction of a counter example. The methods used include the study of stable laws, Gnedenko-Kolmogorov's local limit theorem for stable laws, and the study of the time of first return to equilibrium.
