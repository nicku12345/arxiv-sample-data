Let G be a real connected algebraic semi-simple Lie group, and H an algebraic subgroup of G. Let \mu be a probability measure on G, with finite exponential moment, whose support spans a Zariski-dense subsemigroup of G. Let X=G/H be the quotient of G by H. We study the Markov chain on X with transition probability P_x=\mu *\delta_x for x\in X. We prove that either for every x\in X, almost every trajectory starting from x is transient or for every x\in X, almost every trajectory starting from x is recurrent. In fact, this recurrence is uniform over all X, i.e. there exists a compact set C\subset X such that for each point x\in X, every trajectory starting in x almost surely returns to C infinitely often. Furthermore, we give a criterion for recurrence depending on G, H, and \mu.
