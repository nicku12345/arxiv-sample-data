L. A. Bunimovich and B. Z. Webb developed a theory for transforming a finite weighted graph while preserving its spectrum, referred as isospectral reduction theory. In this work we extend this theory to a class of operators on Banach spaces that include Markov type operators. We apply this theory to infinite countable weighted graphs admitting a finite structural set to calculate the stationary measures of a family of countable Markov chains.
