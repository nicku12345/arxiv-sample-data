In this paper we will consider the concept of \mathbb{P}-weakly hyperbolic iterated function systems on compact metric spaces that generalizes the concept of weakly hyperbolic iterated function systems, as defined by Edalat in \cite{E} and by Arbieto, Santiago and Junqueira in \cite{ASJ} for a more general setting where the parameter space is a compact metric space. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure of a \mathbb{P}-weakly hyperbolic IFS. Furthermore, we prove an ergodic theorem for \mathbb{P}-weakly hyperbolic IFS with compact parameter space.
