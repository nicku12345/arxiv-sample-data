A totally nonnegative matrix is a real-valued matrix whose minors are all nonnegative. In this paper, we concern with the totally nonnegative structure of the finite Toda lattice, a classical integrable system, which is expressed as a differential equation of square matrices. The Toda flow naturally translates into a (multiplicative) linear flow on the (generalized) Jacobi variety associated with some reducible rational curve X. This correspondence provides an algebro-geometric characterization of the totally positive part of the Toda equation. We prove that the totally nonnegative part of the finite Toda lattice is isomorphic to a connected component of \mathrm{Jac}(X)_{\mathbb{R}}, the real part of the generalized Jacobi variety \mathrm{Jac}(X), as semi-algebraic varieties.
