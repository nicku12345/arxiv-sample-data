We describe the multifractal nature of random weak Gibbs measures on some class of attractors associated with C^1 random dynamics semi-conjugate to a random subshift of finite type. This includes the validity of the multifractal formalism, the calculation of Hausdorff and packing dimensions of the so-called level sets of divergent points, and a 0-\infty law for the Hausdorff and packing measures of the level sets of the local dimension.
