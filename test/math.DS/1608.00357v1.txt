We generalize a result of Hochman in two simultaneous directions: Instead of realizing an effectively closed \mathbb{Z}^d action as a factor of a subaction of a \mathbb{Z}^{d+2}-SFT we realize an action of a finitely generated group analogously in any semidirect product of the group with \mathbb{Z}^2. Let H be a finitely generated group and G = \mathbb{Z}^2 \rtimes H a semidirect product. We show that for any effectively closed H-dynamical system (Y,f) where Y is a Cantor set, there exists a G-subshift of finite type (X,\sigma) such that the H-subaction of (X,\sigma) is an extension of (Y,f). In the case where f is an expansive action of a recursively presented group H, a subshift conjugated to (Y,f) can be obtained as the H-projective subdynamics of a G-sofic subshift. As a corollary, we obtain that G admits a non-empty strongly aperiodic subshift of finite type whenever the word problem of H is decidable.
