Central configurations are solutions of the equations \lambda m_j\boldsymbol{q}_j = \frac{\partial U}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_j}, where U denotes the potential function and each \boldsymbol{q}_j is a point in the d-dimensional Euclidean space E\cong {\mathbb R}^d, for j=1,\ldots, n. We show that the vector of the mutual differences \boldsymbol{q}_{ij} = \boldsymbol{q}_i - \boldsymbol{q}_j satisfies the equation -\frac{\lambda}{\alpha} \boldsymbol{q} = P_m(\Psi(\boldsymbol{q})), where P_m is the orthogonal projection over the spaces of 1-cocycles and \Psi(\boldsymbol{q}) = \frac{\boldsymbol{q}}{|\boldsymbol{q}|^{\alpha+2}}. It is shown that differences \boldsymbol{q}_{ij} of central configurations are critical points of an analogue of U, defined on the space of 1-cochains in the Euclidean space E, and restricted to the subspace of 1-cocycles. Some generalizations of well known facts follow almost immediately from this approach.
