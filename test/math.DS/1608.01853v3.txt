We prove statistical limit laws for sequences of Birkhoff sums of the type \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}v_n\circ T_n^j where T_n is a family of nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations. The key ingredient is a new martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations which is useful already in the case when the family T_n is replaced by a fixed transformation T, and which is particularly effective in the case when T_n varies with n. In addition to uniformly expanding/hyperbolic dynamical systems, our results include cases where the family T_n consists of intermittent maps, unimodal maps (along the Collet-Eckmann parameters), Viana maps, and externally forced dispersing billiards. As an application, we prove a homogenization result for discrete fast-slow systems where the fast dynamics is generated by a family of nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations.
