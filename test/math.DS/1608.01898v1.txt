Bifurcation equations, non-degeneracy and transversality conditions are obtained for the fold, transcritical, pitchfork and flip bifurcations for periodic points of one dimensional implicitly defined discrete dynamical systems. The backward Euler method and the trapezoid method for numeric solutions of ordinary differential equations fall in the category of implicit dynamical systems. Examples of bifurcations are given for some implicit dynamical systems including bifurcations for the backward Euler method when the step size is changed.
