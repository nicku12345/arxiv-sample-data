We show that genuinely higher rank expanding actions of abelian semi-groups on compact manifolds are C^{\infty}-conjugate to affine actions on infra-nilmanifolds. This is based on the classification of expanding diffeomorphisms up to \holder conjugacy by Gromov and Shub, and is similar to recent work on smooth classification of higher rank Anosov actions on tori and nilmanifolds. To prove regularity of the conjugacy in the higher rank setting, we establish exponential mixing of solenoid actions induced from semi-group actions by nilmanifold endomorphisms, a result of independent interest. We then proceed similar to the case of higher rank Anosov actions.
