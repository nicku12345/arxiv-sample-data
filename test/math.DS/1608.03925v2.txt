In this paper we introduce a new C^r-perturbation procedure, with respect to the C^r-Epstein topology, for C^r-foliations by surfaces. Using this perturbation procedure we show how one can use the existence of recurrent leaves of certain C^r-foliation \mathcal F to obtain a foliation \mathcal G, C^r-close to \mathcal F in the C^r-Epstein topology, which has a resilient leaf. In particular, one can take advantage of recurrence property to construct examples of C^r-foliations by surfaces, C^r-close to each other and such that one of them has a resilient leaf while the other is Riemannian (therefore has trivial dynamics).
