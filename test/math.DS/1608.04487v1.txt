We characterize the symbolical dynamical systems which are topologically isomorphic to the Fibonacci dynmaical system. We prove that there are infinitely many injective primitive substitutions generating a dynamical system in the Fibonacci conjugacy class. In this class there are infinitely many dynamical systems not generated by a substitution. An example is the system generated by doubling the 0's in the infinite Fibonacci word.
