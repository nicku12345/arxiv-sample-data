In this paper we study well posedness of a certain nonlinear Volterra-Fredholm dynamic integral and integro-dynamic equations on unbounded interval from arbitrary time scale. We derive the time scale analogue of certain integral inequalities of Pachpatte type and using them with Banach's fixed-point theorem to establish the results.
