It was shown by S. Kalikow and B. Weiss that, given a measure-preserving action of \mathbb{Z}^d on a probability space X and a nonnegative measurable function f on X, the probability that the sequence of ergodic averages  \frac 1 {(2k+1)^d} \sum\limits_{g \in [-k,\dots,k]^d} f(g \cdot x)  has at least n fluctuations across an interval (\alpha,\beta) can be bounded from above by c_1 c_2^n for some universal constants c_1 \in \mathbb{R} and c_2 \in (0,1), which depend only on d,\alpha,\beta. The purpose of this article is to generalize this result to measure-preserving actions of groups of polynomial growth. As the main tool we develop a generalization of effective Vitali covering theorem for groups of polynomial growth.
