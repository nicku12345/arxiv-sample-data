A {\it dynamical system\/} is a pair (X,\langle T_s\rangle_{s\in S}), where X is a compact Hausdorff space, S is a semigroup, for each s\in S, T_s is a continuous function from X to X, and for all s,t\in S, T_s\circ T_t=T_{st}. Given a point p\in\beta S, the Stone-\v Cech compactification of the discrete space S, T_p:X\to X is defined by, for x\in X, \displaystyle T_p(x)=p{-}\!\lim_{s\in S}T_s(x). We let \beta S have the operation extending the operation of S such that \beta S is a right topological semigroup and multiplication on the left by any point of S is continuous. Given p,q\in\beta S, T_p\circ T_q=T_{pq}, but T_p is usually not continuous. Given a dynamical system (X,\langle T_s\rangle_{s\in S}), and a point x\in X, we let U(x)=\{p\in\beta S:T_p(x) is uniformly recurrent\}. We show that each U(x) is a left ideal of \beta S and for any semigroup we can get a dynamical system with respect to which K(\beta S)=\bigcap_{x\in X}U(x) and c\ell K(\beta S)=\bigcap\{U(x):x\in X and U(x) is closed\}. And we show that weak cancellation assumptions guarantee that each such U(x) properly contains K(\beta S) and has U(x) \setminus c\ell K(\beta S)\neq \emptyset.
