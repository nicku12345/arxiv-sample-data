For a measure preserving dynamical system (\mathcal{X},f, \mu), we consider the time series of maxima M_n=\max\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\} associated to the process X_n=\phi(f^{n-1}(x)) generated by the dynamical system for some observable \phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}. Using a point process approach we establish weak convergence of the process Y_n(t)=a_n(M_{[nt]}-b_n) to an extremal process Y(t) for suitable scaling constants a_n,b_n\in\mathbb{R}. Convergence here taking place in the Skorokhod space \mathbb{D}(0,\infty) with the J_1 topology. We also establish distributional results for the record times and record values of the corresponding maxima process.
