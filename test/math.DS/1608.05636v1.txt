We study dynamical systems (X,G,m) with a compact metric space X and a locally compact, \sigma-compact, abelian group G. We show that such a system has discrete spectrum if and only if a certain space average over the metric is a Bohr almost periodic function. In this way, this average over the metric plays for general dynamical systems a similar role as the autocorrelation measure plays in the study of aperiodic order for special dynamical systems based on point sets.
