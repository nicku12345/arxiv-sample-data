Under a suitable bunching condition, we establish that stable holonomies inside center-stable manifolds for C^{1+\beta} diffeomorphisms are uniformly bi-Lipschitz and in fact C^{1+\text{H\"older}}. This verifies that the Pugh-Shub theory for ergodicity holds for suitably center-bunched, C^{1+\beta}, essentially accessible, partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism and verifies that the Ledrappier-Young entropy formulas hold for C^{1+\beta} diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds.
