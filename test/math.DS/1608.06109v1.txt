We present a new linearly stable solution of the Euler fluid flow on a torus. On a two-dimensional rectangular periodic domain [0,2\pi)\times[0,2\pi / \kappa) for \kappa\in\mathbb{R}^+, the Euler equations admit a family of stationary solutions given by the vorticity profiles \Omega^*(\mathbf{x})= \Gamma \cos(p_1x_1+ \kappa p_2x_2). We show linear stability for such flows when p_2=0 and \kappa \geq |p_1| (equivalently p_1=0 and \kappa{|p_2|}\leq{1}). The classical result due to Arnold is that for p_1 = 1, p_2 = 0 and \kappa \ge 1 the stationary flow is {nonlinearly} stable via the energy-Casimir method. We show that for \kappa \ge |p_1| \ge 2, p_2 = 0 the flow is linearly stable, but one cannot expect a similar nonlinear stability result. Finally we prove nonlinear instability for all equilibria satisfying p_1^2+\kappa^2{p_2^2}>\frac{{3(\kappa^2+1)}}{4(7-4\sqrt{3})}. The modification and application of a structure-preserving Hamiltonian truncation is discussed for the \kappa\neq 1 case. This leads to an explicit Lie-Poisson integrator for the truncated system.
