A continuous map f on a compact metric space X induces in a natural way the map \tilde f on the hyperspace \mathcal K(X) of all closed non-empty subsets of X. We study the question of transmission of chaos between f and \tilde f. We deal with generic, generic \varepsilon-, dense and dense \varepsilon-chaos for interval maps. We prove that all four types of chaos transmit from f to \tilde f, while the converse transmission from \tilde f to f is true for generic, generic \varepsilon- and dense \varepsilon-chaos. Moreover, the transmission of dense \varepsilon- and generic \varepsilon-chaos from \tilde f to f is true for maps on general compact metric spaces.
