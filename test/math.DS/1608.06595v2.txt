Let G~be a real Lie group and let G^\circ be the identity component of~G. Let G~act on a C^\infty real manifold~M. Assume the action is C^\infty. Assume that the fixpoint set of any nontrivial element of~G^\circ has empty interior in~M. Let n:=\dim G. Assume n\ge1. Let F be the frame bundle of~M of order n-1. We prove: there exists a G-invariant dense open subset~Q of~F such that the G-action on Q has discrete stabilizers.
