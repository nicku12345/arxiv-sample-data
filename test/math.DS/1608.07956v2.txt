In this paper, for the spatial Newtonian 2n-body problem with equal masses, by proving the minimizers of the action functional under certain symmetric, topological and monotone constraints are collision-free, we found a family of spatial double choreographies, which have the common feature that half of the masses are circling around the z-axis clockwise along a spatial loop, while the motions of the other half masses are given by a rotation of the first half around the x-axis by \pi. Both loops are simple, without any self-intersection, and symmetric with respect to the xz-plane and yz-plane. The set of intersection points between the two loops is non-empty and contained in the xy-plane. The number of such double choreographies grows exponentially as n goes to infinity.
