We study how the properties of allowing multiple positive nondegenerate equilibria (MPNE) and multiple positive linearly stable equilibria (MPSE) are inherited in chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Specifically, when is it that we can deduce that a CRN admits MPNE or MPSE based on analysis of its subnetworks? Using basic techniques from analysis we are able to identify a number of situations where MPNE and MPSE are inherited as we build up a network. Some of these modifications are known while others are new, but all results are proved using the same basic framework, which we believe will yield further results. The results are presented primarily for mass action kinetics, although with natural, and in some cases immediate, generalisation to other classes of kinetics.
