Surfaces admitting flows all whose orbits are dense are called minimal. Minimal orientable surfaces were characterized by J.C. Beni\`{e}re in 1998, leaving open the nonorientable case. This paper fills this gap providing a characterization of minimal nonorientable surfaces of finite genus. We also construct an example of a minimal nonorientable surface with infinite genus and conjecture that any nonorientable surface without combinatorial boundary is minimal.
