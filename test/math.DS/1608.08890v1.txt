The quasi-homogeneous (and in general non-homogeneous) polynomial differential systems have been studied from many different points of view. In this paper, Center-focus determination and limit cycles bifurcation for p:q homogeneous weight singular point are investigated. Some prosperities of Successive function and focus values are discussed, furthermore, the method of computing focal values is given. As an example, center-focus determination and limit cycle bifurcation for 2:3 homogeneous weight singular point are studied, three or five limit cycles in the neighborhood of origin can be obtained by different perturbations.
