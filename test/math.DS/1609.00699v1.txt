Let  G  be a connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie group and  \Gamma < G  a lattice. We prove that each ergodic diffeomorphism  \phi(x\Gamma)=uA(x)\Gamma  on the nilmanifold  G/\Gamma , where  u\in G  and  A:G\to G  is a unipotent automorphism satisfying  A(\Gamma)=\Gamma , enjoys the property of asymptotically orthogonal powers (AOP). Two consequences follow:   (i) Sarnak's conjecture on M\"obius orthogonality holds in every uniquely ergodic model of an ergodic affine unipotent diffeomorphism;   (ii) For ergodic affine unipotent diffeomorphisms themselves, the M\"obius orthogonality holds on so called typical short interval:  \frac1 M\sum_{M\leq m<2M}\left|\frac1H\sum_{m\leq n<m+H} f(\phi^n(x\Gamma))\mu (n)\right|\to 0 as  H\to\infty  and  H/M\to0  for each  x\Gamma\in G/\Gamma  and each  f\in C(G/\Gamma) .   In particular, the results in (i) and (ii) hold for ergodic nil-translations. Moreover, we prove that each nilsequence is orthogonal to the M\"obius function \mu on a typical short interval. We also study the problem of lifting of the AOP property to induced actions and derive some applications on uniform distribution.
