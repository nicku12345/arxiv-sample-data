We prove pointwise equidistribution with an error rate of each H-orbit in SL(d,\mathbf{K})/SL(d,\mathbf{Z}) for a certain proper subgroup H of horospherical group over a function field \mathbf{K}, extending a work of Kleinbock-Shi-Weiss. Moreover, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of integral solutions to the Diophantine inequalities with weights, generalizing a result of Dodson-Kristensen-Levesley. This result enables us to show pointwise equidistribution for unbounded functions of class C_\alpha, which was first introduced by Eskin-Margulis-Mozes.
