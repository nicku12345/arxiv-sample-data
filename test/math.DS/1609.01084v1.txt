In this paper we consider sufficient conditions for the existence of uniform compact global attractor for non-autonomous dynamical systems in special classes of infinite-dimensional phase spaces. The obtained generalizations allow us to avoid the restrictive compactness assumptions on the space of shifts of non-autonomous terms in particular evolution problems. The results are applied to several evolution inclusions.
