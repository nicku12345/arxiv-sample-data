We show that if the rotation set of a homeomorphism of the torus is stable under small perturbations of the dynamics, then it is a convex polygon with rational vertices. We also show that such homeomorphisms are C^0-generic and have bounded rotational deviations (even for pseudo-orbits). The results hold both in the area-preserving setting and in the general setting. When the rotation set is stable, we give explicit estimates on the type of rationals that may appear as vertices of rotation sets in terms of the stability constants.
