In this paper, we introduce the concepts of S-asymptotically \omega-periodic solutions in distribution for a class of stochastic fractional functional differential equations. The existence and uniqueness results for the S-asymptotically \omega-periodic solutions in distribution are obtained by means of the successive approximation and the Banach contraction mapping principle, respectively.
