In this paper, we investigate a class of nonlinear impulsive stochastic differential evolution equations with infinite delay in Banach space. Based on the Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem, sufficient conditions of the existence of the square mean piecewise almost periodic solutions to this type of equations are derived. Moreover, the exponential stability of the square mean piecewise almost periodic solution is investigated.
