We prove that there exists a topologically mixing homeomorphism which is completely scrambled. We also prove that for any integer n\geq 1 there is a continuum of topological dimension n supporting a transitive completely scrambled homeomorphism, and n-dimensional compactum supporting a weakly mixing completely scrambled homeomorphism. This solves a 15 year old open problem.
