We show that for every ergodic system (X,\mu,T_1,\ldots,T_d) with commuting transformations, the average \[\frac{1}{N^{d+1}} \sum_{0\leq n_1,\ldots,n_d \leq N-1} \sum_{0\leq n\leq N-1} f_1(T_1^n \prod_{j=1}^d T_j^{n_j}x)f_2(T_2^n \prod_{j=1}^d T_j^{n_j}x)\cdots f_d(T_d^n \prod_{j=1}^d T_j^{n_j}x). \] converges for \mu-a.e. x\in X as N\to\infty. If X is distal, we prove that the average \[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N} f_1(T_1^nx)f_2(T_2^nx)\cdots f_d(T_d^nx) \] converges for \mu-a.e. x\in X as N\to\infty. We also establish the pointwise convergence of averages along cubical configurations arising from a system commuting transformations. Our methods combine the existence of sated and magic extensions introduced by Austin and Host respectively with ideas on topological models by Huang, Shao and Ye.
