In this paper we provide a full topological and ergodic description of the dynamics of Filippov systems nearby a sliding Shilnikov orbit. More specifically we prove that the first return map, defined nearby this orbit, is topologically conjugate to a Bernoulli shift with infinite topological entropy. In particular, we see that for each natural number m it has infinitely many periodic points with period m.
