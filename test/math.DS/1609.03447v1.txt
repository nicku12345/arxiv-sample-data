We consider the Cucker-Smale flocking model with a singular communication weight \psi(s) = s^{-\alpha} with \alpha > 0. We provide a critical value of the exponent \alpha in the communication weight leading to global regularity of solutions or finite-time collision between particles. For \alpha \geq 1, we show that there is no collision between particles in finite time if they are placed in different positions initially. For \alpha\geq 2 we investigate a version of the Cucker-Smale model with expanded singularity i.e. with weight \psi_\delta(s) = (s-\delta)^{-\alpha}, \delta\geq 0. For such model we provide a uniform with respect to the number of particles estimate that controls the \delta-distance between particles. In case of \delta = 0 it reduces to the estimate of non-collisioness.
