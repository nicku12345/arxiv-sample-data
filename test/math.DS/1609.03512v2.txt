We prove that an Anosov flow with \mathcal{C}^{1} stable bundle mixes exponentially whenever the stable and unstable bundles are not jointly integrable. This allows us to show that if a flow is sufficiently close to a volume-preserving Anosov flow and \operatorname{dim} \mathbb{E}_s = 1, \operatorname{dim} \mathbb{E}_u \geq 2 then the flow mixes exponentially whenever the stable and unstable bundles are not jointly integrable.This implies the existence of non-empty open sets of exponentially mixing Anosov flows. As part of the proof of this result we show that \mathcal{C}^{1+} uniformly-expanding suspension semiflows (in any dimension) mix exponentially when the return time in not cohomologous to a piecewise constant.
