We investigate how spectral properties of a measure preserving system (X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T) are reflected in the multiple ergodic averages arising from that system. For certain sequences a:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N} we provide natural conditions on the spectrum \sigma(T) such that for all f_1,\ldots,f_k\in L^\infty, \begin{equation*} \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^k T^{ja(n)}f_j = \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^k T^{jn}f_j \end{equation*} in L^2-norm. In particular, our results apply to infinite arithmetic progressions a(n)=qn+r, Beatty sequences a(n)=\lfloor \theta n+\gamma\rfloor, the sequence of squarefree numbers a(n)=q_n, and the sequence of prime numbers a(n)=p_n. We also obtain a new refinement of Szemer\'edi's theorem via Furstenberg's correspondence principle.
