Akin and Kolyada in 2003 [E. Akin, S. Kolyada, Li-Yorke sensitivity, Nonlinearity 16 (2003) 1421 - 1433] introduced the notion of Li-Yorke sensitivity. They proved that every weak mixing system (X, T), where X is a compact metric space and T a continuous map of X is Li-Yorke sensitive. An example of Li-Yorke sensitive system without weak mixing factors was given in [M. \v{C}iklov\'a, Li-Yorke sensitive minimal maps, Nonlinearity 19 (2006) 517 - 529] (see also [M. \v{C}iklov\'a-Ml\'{\i}chov\'a, Li-Yorke sensitive minimal maps II, Nonlinearity 22 (2009) 1569 -1573]). In their paper, Akin and Kolyada conjectured that every minimal system with a weak mixing factor, is Li-Yorke sensitive. We provide arguments supporting this conjecture though the proof seems to be difficult.
