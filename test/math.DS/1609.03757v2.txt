We study the spectral measures of conservative mixing flows on the 2-torus having one degenerate singularity. We show that, for a sufficiently strong singularity, the spectrum of these flows is typically Lebesgue with infinite multiplicity. For this, we use two main ingredients: 1) a proof of absolute continuity of the maximal spectral type for this class of non-uniformly stretching flows that have an irregular decay of correlations, 2) a geometric criterion that yields infinite Lebesgue multiplicity of the spectrum and that is well adapted to rapidly mixing flows.
