As a particular problem within the field of non-autonomous discrete systems, we consider iterations of two quadratic maps f_{c_0}=z^2+c_0 and f_{c_1}=z^2+c_1, according to a prescribed binary sequence, which we call a \emph{template}. We study the asymptotic behavior of the critical orbits, and define the Mandelbrot set in this case as the locus for which these orbits are bounded. However, unlike in the case of single maps, this concept can be understood in several ways. For a fixed template, one may consider this locus as a subset of the parameter space in (c_0,c_1) \in \mathbb{C}^2; for fixed quadratic parameters, one may consider the set of templates which produce a bounded critical orbit. In this paper, we consider both situations, as well as \emph{hybrid} combinations of them, we study basic topological properties of these sets and interpret them in light of potential applications.
