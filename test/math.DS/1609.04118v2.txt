Let H = \mathrm{SO}(n,1) and A = \{a(t): t \in \mathbb{R}\} be a maximal \mathbb{R}-split Cartan subgroup of H. Let \Gamma \subset H \times H be a nonuniform lattice in H \times H and X_{\Gamma} : = H \times H/ \Gamma. Let A_2 : = \{ a_2(t):=a(t) \times a(t) : t \in \mathbb{R}\} \subset A\times A on X_{\Gamma} and \mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}\subset X_{\Gamma} denote the collection of points x \in X_{\Gamma} such that a_2(t)x diverges as t \rightarrow +\infty. In this note, we will show that if the Hausdorff dimension of \mathcal{D}_{\Gamma} is greater than \dim (H\times H) - 2(n-1), then \Gamma  is essentially split, namely, it contains a subgroup of finite index of form \Gamma_1 \times \Gamma_2 , where \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2 are both lattices in H.
