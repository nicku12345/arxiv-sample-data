A bifurcation from the incoherent state to the partially synchronized state of the Kuramoto-Daido model with the coupling function f(\theta ) = \sin (\theta +\alpha _1)   + h\sin 2(\theta +\alpha _2) is investigated based on the generalized spectral theory and the center manifold reduction. The dynamical system of the order parameter on a center manifold is derived under the assumption that there exists a center manifold on the dual space of a certain test function space. It is shown that the incoherent state loses the stability at a critical coupling strength K=K_c, and a stable rotating partially synchronized state appears for K>K_c. The velocity of the rotating state is different from the average of natural frequencies of oscillators when \alpha _1 \neq 0.
