In this paper, we study the spreading speeds and traveling wave solutions of the PDE  \begin{cases} u_{t}= \Delta u-\chi \nabla \cdot (u \nabla v) + u(1-u),\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^N 0=\Delta v-v+u, \ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \end{cases}  where u(x,t) and v(x,t) represent the population and the chemoattractant densities, respectively, and \chi is the chemotaxis sensitivity. It has been shown in an earlier work by the authors of the current paper that, when 0<\chi<1, for every nonnegative uniformly continuous and bounded function u_0(x), the system has a unique globally bounded classical solution (u(x,t;u_0),v(x,t;u_0)) with initial condition u(x,0;u_0)=u_0(x). Furthermore, if 0<\chi<\frac{1}{2}, then the constant steady-state solution (1,1) is asymptotically stable with respect to strictly positive perturbations. In the current paper, we show that if 0<\chi<1, then there are nonnegative constants c_{-}^*(\chi)\leq c_+^*(\chi) such that for every nonnegative initial function u_0(\cdot) with nonempty compact support  \lim_{t\to\infty} \sup_{|x|\le ct} \big[|u(x,t;u_0)-1|+|v(x,t;u_0)-1|\big]=0\ \ \forall\ 0<c<c_{-}^*(\chi)  and  \lim_{t\to\infty}\sup_{|x|\geq ct} \big[ u(x,t;u_0)+v(x,t;u_0)\big]=0\ \ \forall\ c>c_{+}^*(\chi). We also show that if 0<\chi<\frac{1}{2}, there is a positive constant c^*(\chi) such that for every c\ge c^*(\chi), the system has a traveling wave solution (u(x,t),v(x,t)) with speed c and connecting (1,1) and (0,0), that is, (u(x,t),v(x,t))=(U(x-ct),V(x-ct)) for some functions U(\cdot) and V(\cdot) satisfying (U(-\infty),V(-\infty))=(1,1) and (U(\infty),V(\infty))=(0,0). Moreover,  \lim_{\chi\to 0}c^*(\chi)=\lim_{\chi\to 0}c_+^*(\chi)=\lim_{\chi\to 0}c_-^*(\chi)=2.  We first give a detailed study in the case N=1 and next we extend these results to the case N\ge 2.
