We consider smooth actions of lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups on manifolds. We define two numbers r(G) and m(G) associated with the roots system of the Lie algebra of a Lie group G. If the dimension of the manifold is smaller than r(G), then we show the action preserves a Borel probability measure. If the dimension of the manifold is at most m(G), we show there is a quasi-invariant measure on the manifold such that the action is measurable isomorphic to a relatively measure preserving action over a standard boundary action.
