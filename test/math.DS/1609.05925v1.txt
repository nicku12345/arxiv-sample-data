We suggest a method to construct new examples of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. We begin with a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f\colon M\to M which leaves invariant a submanifold N\subset M. We assume that N is an Anosov submanifold for f, that is, the restriction f|_N is an Anosov diffeomorphism and the center distribution is transverse to TN\subset TM. By replacing each point in N with the projective space (real or complex) of lines normal to N we obtain the blow-up \hat M. Replacing M with \hat M amounts to a surgery on the neighborhood of N which alters the topology of the manifold. The diffeomorphism f induces a canonical diffeomorphism \hat f\colon \hat M\to \hat M. We prove that under certain assumptions on the local dynamics of f at N the diffeomorphism \hat f is also partially hyperbolic. We also present some modifications such as the connected sum construction which allows to "paste together" two partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms to obtain a new one. Finally, we present several examples to which our results apply.
