The Tribonacci sequence \mathbb{T} is the fixed point of the substitution \sigma(a)=ab, \sigma(b)=ac, \sigma(c)=a. The prefix of \mathbb{T} of length n is denoted by \mathbb{T}[1,n]. The main result is threefold, we give: (1) explicit expressions of the numbers of distinct squares and cubes in \mathbb{T}[1,n]; (2) algorithms for counting the numbers of repeated squares and cubes in \mathbb{T}[1,n]; (3) a discussion about \alpha-powers in \mathbb{T}[1,n] for \alpha\geq2 and n\geq1.
