We prove that an analytic quasiperiodically forced circle flow with a not super-Liouvillean base frequency and which is close enough to some constant rotation is C^{\infty} rotations reducible, provided its fibered rotation number is Diophantine with respect to the base frequency. As a corollary, we obtain that among such systems, the linearizable ones and those displaying mode-locking are locally dense for the C^\infty-topology.
