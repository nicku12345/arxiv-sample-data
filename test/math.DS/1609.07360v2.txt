A fundamental problem in the dimension theory of self-affine sets is the construction of high-dimensional measures which yield sharp lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of the set. A natural strategy for the construction of such high-dimensional measures is to investigate measures of maximal Lyapunov dimension; these measures can be alternatively interpreted as equilibrium states of the singular value function introduced by Falconer. Whilst the existence of these equilibrium states has been well-known for some years their structure has remained elusive, particularly in dimensions higher than two. In this article we give a complete description of the equilibrium states of the singular value function in the three-dimensional case, showing in particular that all such equilibrium states must be fully supported. In higher dimensions we also give a new sufficient condition for the uniqueness of these equilibrium states. As a corollary, giving a solution to a folklore open question in dimension three, we prove that for a typical self-affine set in \mathbb{R}^3, removing one of the affine maps which defines the set results in a strict reduction of the Hausdorff dimension.
