Consider a homeomorphism f defined on a compact metric space X and a continuous map \phi\colon X \to \mathbb{R}. We provide an abstract criterion, called \emph{control at any scale with a long sparse tail} for a point x\in X and the map \phi, that guarantees that any weak\ast limit measure \mu of the Birkhoff average of Dirac measures \frac1n\sum_0^{n-1}\delta(f^i(x)) is such that \mu-almost every point y has a dense orbit in X and the Birkhoff average of \phi along the orbit of y is zero.   As an illustration of the strength of this criterion, we prove that the diffeomorphisms with nonhyperbolic ergodic measures form a C^1-open and dense subset of the set of robustly transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one dimensional nonhyperbolic central direction. We also obtain applications for nonhyperbolic homoclinic classes.
