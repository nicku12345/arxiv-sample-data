Inspired by work of McMullen, we show that any orbit of the diagonal group in the space of lattices accumulates on the set of stable lattices. As consequences, we settle a conjecture of Ramharter concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the Mordell constant, and reduce Minkowski's conjecture on products of linear forms to a geometric question, yielding two new proofs of the conjecture in dimensions up to 7.
