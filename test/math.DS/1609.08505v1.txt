Let (S,\Phi) be a pair of a closed oriented surface and \Phi be a real analytic flow with finitely many singularities. Let x be a point of S with the polycycle \omega-limit set \omega(x). In this paper we give topological classification of \omega(x). Our main theorem says that \omega(x) is diffeomorphic to the boundary of a cactus in the 2-sphere S^{2}. Moreover S is a connected sum of the above S^{2} and a closed oriented surface along finitely many embedded circles which are disjoint from \omega(x). This gives a natural generalization to the higher genus of the main result of \cite{JL} for the genus 0 case. Our result is further applicable to a larger class of surface flows, a compact oriented surface with corner and a C^{1}-flow with finitely many singularities locally diffeomorphic to an analytic flow.
