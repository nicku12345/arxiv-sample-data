A simple first-principles mathematical model is developed to predict the performance of a micro photosynthetic power cell (\muPSC), an electrochemical device which generates electricity by harnessing electrons from photosynthesis in the presence of light. A lumped parameter approach is used to develop a model in which the electrochemical kinetic rate constants and diffusion effects are lumped into a single characteristic rate constant K. A non-parametric estimation of K for the \muPSC is performed by minimizing the sum square errors (SSE) between the experimental and model predicted current and voltages. The developed model is validated by comparing the model predicted v-i characteristics with experimental data not used in the parameter estimation. Sensitivity analysis of the design parameters and the operational parameters reveal interesting insights for performance enhancement. Analysis of the model also suggests that there are two different operating regimes that are observed in this \muPSC. This modeling approach can be used in other designs of \muPSCs for performance enhancement studies.
