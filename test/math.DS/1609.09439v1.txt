Let \mathfrak{X}^{1}(M) be the space of C^{1}-vector fields on M endowed with the C^{1}-topology and let \Lambda be an isolated set for a X\in\mathfrak{X}^{1}(M). In this paper, we directly prove that every X\in\mathfrak{X}^{1}(M) having the (asymptotic) average shadowing property in \Lambda has no proper attractor in \Lambda. Our proof is a direct version of the results by Gu and Ribeiro. We also show that every X\in\mathfrak{X}^{1}(M) having the (two-sided) limit shadowing property with a gap in \Lambda is topologically transitive and has the shadowing property in \Lambda.
