In a previous paper, dealing with "Applications in \mathbb{R}^1," the authors developed a new approach to the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant set of an iterated function system or IFS and studied some applications in one dimension. The key idea, which has been known in varying degrees of generality for many years, is to associate to the IFS a parametrized family of positive, linear, Perron-Frobenius operators L_s. In our context, L_s is studied in a space of C^m functions and is not compact. Nevertheless, it is has a strictly positive C^m eigenfunction v_s with positive eigenvalue \lambda_s equal to the spectral radius of L_s. Under appropriate assumptions on the IFS, the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant set of the IFS is the value s=s_* for which \lambda_s =1. To compute the Hausdorff dimension of an IFS associated to complex continued fractions, (which may arise from an infinite iterated function system), we again approximate the eigenvalue problem by a collocation method, but now using continuous piecewise bilinear functions. Using the theory of positive linear operators and explicit a priori bounds on the partial derivatives of the strictly positive eigenfunction v_s, we are able to give rigorous upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension s_*, and these bounds converge to s_* as the mesh size approaches zero. We also demonstrate by numerical computations that improved estimates can be obtained by the use of higher order piecewise tensor product polynomial approximations, although the present theory does not guarantee that these are strict upper and lower bounds. An important feature of our approach is that it also applies to the much more general problem of computing approximations to the spectral radius of positive transfer operators, which arise in many other applications.
