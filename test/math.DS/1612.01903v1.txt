From KAM Theory it follows that the measure of phase points which do not lie on Diophantine, Lagrangian, "primary" tori in a nearly--integrable, real--analytic Hamiltonian system is O(\sqrt{\varepsilon}), if \varepsilon is the size of the perturbation. In this paper we discuss how the constant in front of \sqrt{\varepsilon} depends on the unperturbed system and in particular on the phase--space domain.
