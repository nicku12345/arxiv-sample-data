In many dynamical systems, countably infinitely many invariant tori co-exist. The occurrence of quasiperiodicity on any one of these tori is sometimes sufficient to establish strong global properties, like dense trajectories and periodic points. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions for a countably infinite collection of parameterized circle diffeomorphisms to have quasiperiodic behavior on at least one of the circles, for a full Lebesgue measure set of the parameter values. As an application, we study parameterized families of skew-product maps on the torus and prove sufficient conditions for the existence of at least on quasiperiodic circle for Lebesgue-almost every parameter value.
