We consider Holder continuous cocycles over hyperbolic dynamical systems with values in the group of invertible bounded linear operators on a Banach space. We show that two fiber bunched cocycles are Holder continuously cohomologous if and only if they have Holder conjugate periodic data. The fiber bunching condition means that non-conformality of the cocycle is dominated by the expansion and contraction in the base system. We show that this condition can be established based on the periodic data of a cocycle. We also establish Holder continuity of a measurable conjugacy between a fiber bunched cocycle and one with values in a set which is compact in strong operator topology.
