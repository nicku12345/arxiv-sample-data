Let P\in Sp(2n) satisfying P^{k}=I_{2n}, we consider the minimal P-symmetric period problem of the autonomous nonlinear Hamiltonian system   \begin{equation*} \dot x(t) = JH^{\prime}(x(t)). \end{equation*} For some symplectic matrices P, we show that for any \tau>0 the above Hamiltonian system possesses a k\tau periodic solution x with k\tau being its minimal P-symmetric period provided H satisfies the Rabinowitz's conditions on the minimal period conjecture, together with that H is convex and H(Px)=H(x).
