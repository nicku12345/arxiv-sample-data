This paper is concerned with growth series for expansion complexes for finite subdivision rules. Suppose X is an expansion complex for a finite subdivision rule with bounded valence and mesh approaching 0, and let S be a seed for X. One can define a growth series for (X,S) by giving the tiles in the seed norm 0 and then using either the skinny path norm or the fat path norm to recursively define norms for the other tiles. The main theorem is that, with respect to either of these norms, the growth series for (X,S) has polynomial growth. Furthermore, the degrees of the growth rates of hyperbolic expansion complexes are dense in the ray [2,\infty).
