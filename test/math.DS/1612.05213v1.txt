We introduce a special subset of the graph of a homogeneous coupled cell network, called a projection block, and show that the network obtained from identifying this block to a single point can be used to understand the generic bifurcations of the original network. This technique is then used to describe the bifurcations in a generalized feed-forward network, in which the loop can contain more than one cell.
