Consider a stochastic process (S_{[a_i,b_i]})_{[a_i,b_i] \subset \mathbb{N}}, which is indexed by the collection of all nonempty intervals [a_i,b_i] \subset \mathbb{N} and which is stationary under translations of the intervals. It was shown by M. Hochman that, for any k \geq 1 and any interval (\alpha,\beta) \subset \mathbb{R}, one can give an `almost-exponential' bound on the size of the set where the associated process (S_{[1,n]})_{n \geq 1} has at least k fluctuations over (\alpha,\beta). It was also noticed that a similar techniques can be applied in \mathbb{Z}^d case. In this article we extend Hochman's upcrossing theorem to groups of polynomial growth.
