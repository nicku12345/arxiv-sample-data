In this paper we introduce a new compactness condition - Property (C) - for flows in (not necessary locally compact) metric spaces. For such flows a Conley type theory can be developed. For example (regular) index pairs always exist for Property-(C) flows and a Conley index can be defined. An important class of flows satisfying this compactness condition are LS-flows. We apply E-cohomology to index pairs of LS-flows and obtain the E-cohomological Conley index. We formulate a continuation principle for the E-cohomological Conley index and show that all LS-flows can be continued to LS-gradient flows. We show that the Morse homology of LS-gradient flows computes the E-cohomological Conley index. We use Lyapunov functions to define the Morse-Conley-Floer cohomology in this context, and show that it is also isomorphic to the E-cohomological Conley index.
