We prove a theorem asserting that, given a Diophantine rotation \alpha  in a torus \T ^{d} \equiv \R ^{d} / \Z ^{d}, any perturbation, small enough in the C^{\infty} topology, that does not destroy all orbits with rotation vector \alpha is actually smoothly conjugate to the rigid rotation. The proof relies on a K.A.M. scheme (named after Kolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser), where at each step the existence of an invariant measure with rotation vector \alpha assures that we can linearize the equations around the same rotation \alpha. The proof of the convergence of the scheme is carried out in the C^{\infty} category.
