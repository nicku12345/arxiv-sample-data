Let \Sigma_{A}(\mathbb{N}) be a topologically mixing countable Markov shift with the BIP property over the alphabet \mathbb{N} and f: \Sigma_{A}(\mathbb{N}) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} a potential satisfying the Walters condition with finite Gurevich pressure. Under suitable hypotheses, we prove the existence of a Large Deviation Principle for the family (\mu_{\beta})_{\beta > 0} where each \mu_{\beta} is the Gibbs measure associated to the potential \beta f. Our main theorem generalizes from finite to countable alphabets and also to a larger class of potentials a previous result of A. Baraviera, A. O. Lopes and P. Thieullen.
