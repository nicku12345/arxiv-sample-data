In this paper we study topological entropy and recurrence properties of non-autonomous dynamical system generated by a family of continuous self maps on a compact space X. Specially, we introduce the pseudo-entropy and periodic-pseudo-entropy and prove their equivalence with the topological entropy for non-autonomous dynamical systems.
