We compute the fixed point index of non-degenerate central configurations for the n-body problem in the euclidean space of dimension d, relating it to the Morse index of the gravitational potential function \bar U induced on the manifold of all maximal O(d)-orbits. In order to do so, we analyze the geometry of maximal orbit type manifolds, and compute Morse indices with respect to the mass-metric bilinear form on configuration spaces.
