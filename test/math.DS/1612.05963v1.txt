This paper aims at formulating definitions of topological stability, structural stability, and expansiveness property for an iterated function system( abbrev, IFS). It is going to show that the shadowing property is necessary condition for structural stability in IFSs. Then, it proves the previous converse demonstration with the addition of expansiveness property for IFSs. It asserts that structural stability implies shadowing property in IFSs and presents an example to reject of the converse assertion.
