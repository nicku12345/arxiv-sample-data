This paper considers the egodicity properties in iterated function systems. First, we will introduce chain mixing and chain transitive iterated function systems then some results and examples are presented to compare with these notions in discrete dynamical systems. As our main result, using adding machine maps and topological conjugacy we show that chain mixing, chain transitive and chain recurrence properties in iterated function systems are equivalent.
