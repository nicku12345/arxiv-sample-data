We consider the planar central configurations of the Newtonian \kappa n-body problem consisting in \kappa groups of n-gons where all n bodies in each group have the same mass, called (\kappa, n)-crown. We study the location and the number of central configurations when \kappa=2. For n=3 the number of central configurations varies depending on the mass ratio, whereas for n\geq 4 the number is at least three. We also prove that for n\geq 3 there always exist three disjoint regions where the configuration can be located. Finally, we study which (\kappa, n)-crowns are convex.
