The Sitnikov problem is a special case of the restricted three-body problem where the primaries moves in elliptic orbits of the two-body problem with eccentricity e\in [0,1[ and the massless body moves on a straight line perpendicular to the plane of motion of the primaries through their barycenter. It is well known that for the circular case (e=0) and a given N\in \mathbb{N} there are a finite number of nontrivial symmetric 2N\pi periodic solutions all of them parabolic and unstable (in the Lyapunov sense) if we consider the corresponding autonomous equation like a 2\pi-periodic equation. Using the method of global continuation of Leray-Schauder, J.Llibre and R.Ortega (J.Llibre \& R. Ortega, 2008) proved that these families of periodic solutions can be continued from the known 2N\pi-periodic solutions in the circular case for nonnecessarily small values of the eccentricity e and in some cases for all values of e\in \, [0,1[. However this approach does not say anything about the stability properties of this periodic solutions.   In this document we present a new method that quantifies the mentioned bifurcating families and them stabilities properties at least in first approximation. Our approach proposes two general methods: The first one is to estimate the growing of the canonical solutions for one-parametric differential equation of the form \[ \ddot{x}+a(t,\lambda)x=0, \] with a\in C^{1}([0,T] \times [0,\Lambda]). The second one gives stability criteria for one-parametric Hill's equation of the form \[ \ddot{x}+q(t,\lambda)x=0, \quad (\ast) \] where q(\cdot,\lambda) is T-periodic and q\in C^{3}(\mathbb{R}\times [0,\Lambda]), such that for \lambda=0 the equation (*) is parabolic.
