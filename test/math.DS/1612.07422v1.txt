Let f be an exact area-preserving monotone twist diffeomorphism of the infinite cylinder and P_{\omega,f}(\xi) be the associated Peierls barrier. In this paper, we give the H\"{o}lder regularity of P_{\omega,f}(\xi) with respect to the parameter f. In fact, we prove that if the rotation symbol \omega\in (\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q})\bigcup(\mathbb{Q}+)\bigcup(\mathbb{Q}-), then P_{\omega,f}(\xi) is 1/3-H\"{o}lder continuous in f, i.e. |P_{\omega,f'}(\xi)-P_{\omega,f}(\xi)|\leq C\|f'-f\|_{C^1}^{1/3} ,~~\forall \xi\in\mathbb{R} where C is a constant. Similar results also hold for the Lagrangians with one and a half degrees of freedom. As application, we give an open and dense result about the breakup of invariant circles.
