We revisit non-autonomous systems depending quasi-periodically in time within the reversible context 2 of KAM theory and obtain Whitney smooth families of invariant tori in such systems via Herman's method. The reversible KAM context 2 refers to the situation where the dimension of the fixed point manifold of the reversing involution is less than half the codimension of the invariant torus in question.
