We present new local and global dynamic bifurcation results for nonlinear evolution equations of the form u_t+A u=f_\lambda(u) on a Banach space X, where A is a sectorial operator, and \lambda\in R is the bifurcation parameter. Suppose the equation has a trivial solution branch \{(0,\lambda):\,\,\lambda\in R\}. Denote \Phi_\lambda the local semiflow generated by the initial value problem of the equation. It is shown that if the crossing number n at a bifurcation value \lambda=\lambda_0 is nonzero and moreover, S_0=\{0\} is an isolated invariant set of \Phi_{\lambda_0}, then either there is a one-sided neighborhood I_1 of \lambda_0 such that \Phi_\lambda bifurcates a topological sphere \mathbb{S}^{n-1} for each \lambda\in I_1\setminus\{\lambda_0\}, or there is a two-sided neighborhood I_2 of \lambda_0 such that the system \Phi_\lambda bifurcates from the trivial solution an isolated nonempty compact invariant set K_\lambda with 0\not\in K_\lambda for each \lambda\in I_2\setminus\{\lambda_0\}. We also prove that the bifurcating invariant set has nontrivial Conley index. Building upon this fact we establish a global dynamical bifurcation theorem. Roughly speaking, we prove that for any given neighborhood \Omega of the bifurcation point (0,\lambda_0), the connected bifurcation branch \Gamma from (0,\lambda_0) either meets the boundary \partial\Omega of \Omega, or meets another bifurcation point (0,\lambda_1). This result extends the well-known Rabinowitz's Global Bifurcation Theorem to the setting of dynamic bifurcations of evolution equations without requiring the crossing number to be odd.   As an illustration example, we consider the well-known Cahn-Hilliard equation. Some global features on dynamical bifurcations of the equation are discussed.
