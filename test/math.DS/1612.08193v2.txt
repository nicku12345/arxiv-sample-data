The Kakutani-Bebutov Theorem (1968) states that any compact metric real flow whose fixed point set is homeomorphic to a subset of \mathbb{R} embeds into the Bebutov flow, the \mathbb{R}-shift on C(\mathbb{R},[0,1]). An interesting fact is that this universal space is a function space. However, it is not compact, nor locally compact. We construct an explicit countable product of compact subspaces of the Bebutov flow which is a universal space for all compact metric real flows, with no restriction; namely, into which any compact metric real flow embeds. The result is compared to previously known universal spaces.
