The paper deals with Newton maps of complex exponential functions and a surgery tool developed by P. Ha\"issinsky. The concept of "Postcritically minimal" Newton maps of complex exponential functions are introduced, analogous to postcritically finite Newton maps of polynomials. The dynamics preserving mapping is constructed between the space of postcritically finite Newton maps of polynomials and the space of postcritically minimal Newton maps of complex exponential functions.
