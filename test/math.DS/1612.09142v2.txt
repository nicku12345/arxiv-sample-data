We consider a direct product of a suspension flow over a substitution dynamical system and an arbitrary ergodic flow and give quantitative estimates for the speed of convergence for ergodic integrals of such systems. Our argument relies on new uniform estimates of the spectral measure for suspension flows over substitution dynamical systems. The paper answers a question by Jon Chaika.
