The following well known open problem is answered in the negative: Given two compact spaces X and Y that admit minimal homeomorphisms, must the Cartesian product X\times Y admit a minimal homeomorphism as well? A key element of our construction is an inverse limit approach inspired by combination of a technique of Aarts & Oversteegen and the construction of Slovak spaces by Downarowicz & Snoha & Tywoniuk. This approach allows us also to prove the following result. Let \phi\colon M\times\mathbb{R}\to M be a continuous, aperiodic minimal flow on the compact, finite--dimensional metric space M. Then there is a generic choice of parameters c\in\mathbb{R}, such that the homeomorphism h(x)=\phi(x,c) admits a noninvertible minimal map f\colon M\to M as an almost 1-1 extension.
