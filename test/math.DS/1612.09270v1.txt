We consider the n--body problem defined on surfaces of constant negative curvature. For the case of n--equal masses we prove that the hyperbolic relative equilibria with a regular polygonal shape do not exist. In particular the Lagrangian (three equal distances) hyperbolic relative equilibria do not exist. We also show the existence of a new class of hyperbolic collinear relative equilibria for the five body problem on surfaces of constant negative curvature.
