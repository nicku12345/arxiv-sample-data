The statistical and Milnor attractors of step skew products over the Bernoulli shift are studied. For the case of the fiber a circle we prove that for a topologically generic step skew product the statistical and the Milnor attractor coincide and are Lyapunov stable. For this end we study some properties of the projection of the attractor onto the fiber, which might be of independent interest. For the case of the fiber being a segment we give a description of the Milnor attractor as the closure of the union of graphs of finitely many almost everywhere defined functions from the base of the skew product to the fiber.
