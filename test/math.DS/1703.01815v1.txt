We introduce a new measure of instability of area-preserving twist diffeomorphisms, which generalizes the notions of angle of splitting of separatrices, and flux through a gap of a Cantori. As an example of application, we establish a sharp >0 lower bound on the topological entropy in a neighbourhood of a hyperbolic, unique action-minimizing fixed point, assuming only no topological obstruction to diffusion, i.e. no homotopically non-trivial invariant circle consisting of orbits with the rotation number 0. The proof is based on a new method of precise construction of positive entropy invariant measures, applicable to more general Lagrangian systems, also in higher degrees of freedom.
