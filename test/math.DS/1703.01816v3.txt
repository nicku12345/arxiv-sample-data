Motivated by a recent result of Ciesielski and Jasinski we study periodic point free Cantor systems that are conjugate to systems with vanishing derivative everywhere, and more generally locally radially shrinking maps. Our study uncovers a whole spectrum of dynamical behaviors attainable for such systems, providing new counterexamples to the Conjecture of Edrei from 1952, first disproved by Williams in 1954.
