We say that a compact invariant set \Lambda of a C^1-vector field X on a compact boundaryless Riemannian manifold M is robustly shadowable if it is locally maximal with respect to a neighborhood U of \Lambda, and there exists a C^1-neigborhood \mathcal{U} of X such that for any Y \in \mathcal{U}, the continuation \Lambda_Y of \Lambda for Y and U is shadowable for Y_t. In this paper, we prove that any chain transitive set of a C^1-vector field on M is hyperbolic if and only if it is robustly shadowable.
