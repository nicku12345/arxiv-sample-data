In the following text we introduce specification property (stroboscopical property) for dynamical systems on uniform space. We focus on two classes of dynamical systems: generalized shifts and dynamical systems with Alexandroff compactification of a discrete space as phase space. We prove that for a discrete finite topological space X with at least two elements, a nonempty set \Gamma and a self--map \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma the generalized shift dynamical system (X^\Gamma,\sigma_\varphi): \begin{itemize} \item has (almost) weak specification property if and only if \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma   does not have any periodic point,   \item has (uniform) stroboscopical property if and only if \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma   is one-to-one. \end{itemize}
