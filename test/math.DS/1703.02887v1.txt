The dynamics about the libration points of the Hill problem is investigated analytically. In particular, the use of Lissajous variables and perturbation theory allows to reduce the problem to a one degree of freedom Hamiltonian depending on two physical parameters. The invariant manifolds structure of the Hill problem is then disclosed, yet accurate computations are limited to energy values close to that of the libration points.
