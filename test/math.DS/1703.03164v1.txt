We show there exists a constant 0<c_{0}<1 such that the dimension of every measure on [0,1], which makes the digits in the continued fraction expansion independent, is at most 1-c_{0}. This extends a result of Kifer, Peres and Weiss from 2001, which established this under the additional assumption of stationarity. For k\ge1 we prove an analogues statement for measures under which the digits form a *-mixing k-step Markov chain. This is also generalized to the case of f-expansions. In addition, we construct for each k a measure, which makes the continued fraction digits a stationary and *-mixing k-step Markov chain, with dimension at least 1-2^{3-k}.
