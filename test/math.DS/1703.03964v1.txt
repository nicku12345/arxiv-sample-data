For a two parameter family of two-dimensional piecewise linear maps and for every natural number  n  we prove not only the existence of intervals of parameters for which the respective maps are  n  times renormalizable but also we show the existence of intervals of parameters where the coexistence of at least  2^n  strange attractors takes place. This family of maps contains the two-dimensional extension of the classical one-dimensional family of tent maps.
