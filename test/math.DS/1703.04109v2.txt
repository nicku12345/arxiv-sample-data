We consider a second order non-autonomous system which can be interpreted as the Newtonian equation of motion on a Riemannian manifold under the action of time-quasiperiodic force field. The problem is to find conditions which ensures: (a) the existence of a solution taking values in a given bounded domain of configuration space and possessing a bounded derivative; (b) the hyperbolicity of such a solution; (c) the uniqueness and, as a consequence, the quasiperiodicity of such a solution. Our approach exploits ideas of Wa\.zewski topological principle. The required conditions are formulated in terms of an auxiliary convex function U. We use this function to establish the Landau type inequality for the derivative of solution, as well as to introduce the notion of U-monotonicity for the system. The U-monotonicity property of the system implies the uniqueness and the quasiperiodicity of its bounded solution. We also find the bounds for magnitude of perturbations which do not destroy the quasiperiodic solution.   The results obtained are applied to study the motion of a charged particle on a unite sphere under the action of time-quasiperiodic electric and magnetic fields.
