We prove a comprehensive version of the Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius Theorem with explicit estimates of the spectral radius of the Ruelle transfer operator and various other quantities related to spectral properties of this operator. The novelty here is that the H\"older constant of the function generating the operator appears only polynomially, not exponentially as in previous known estimates.
