The complement M\setminus L of the Lagrange spectrum L in the Markov spectrum M was studied by many authors (including Freiman, Berstein, Cusick and Flahive). After their works, we disposed of a countable collection of points in M\setminus L.   In this article, we describe the structure of M\setminus L near a non-isolated point \alpha_{\infty} found by Freiman in 1973, and we use this description to exhibit a concrete Cantor set X whose Hausdorff dimension coincides with the Hausdorff dimension of M\setminus L near \alpha_{\infty}.   A consequence of our results is the lower bound HD(M\setminus L)>0.353 on the Hausdorff dimension HD(M\setminus L) of M\setminus L. Another by-product of our analysis is the explicit construction of new elements of M\setminus L, including its largest known member c\in M\setminus L (surpassing the former largest known number \alpha_4\in M\setminus L obtained by Cusick and Flahive in 1989).
