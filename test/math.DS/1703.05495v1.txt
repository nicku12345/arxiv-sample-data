We construct a complete invariant for non-wandering surface flows with finitely many singular points but without locally dense orbits. Precisely, we show that a flow v with finitely many singular points on a compact connected surface S is a non-wandering flow without locally dense orbits if and only if S/v_{\mathrm{ex}} is a non-trivial embedded multi-graph, where the extended orbit space S/v_{\mathrm{ex}} is the quotient space defined by x \sim y if they belong to either a same orbit or a same multi-saddle connection. Moreover, collapsing edges of the non-trivial embedded multi-graph S/v_{\mathrm{ex}} into singletons, the quotient space (S/v_{\mathrm{ex}})/\sim_E is an abstract multi-graph with the Alexandroff topology with respect to the specialization order. Therefore the non-wandering flow v with finitely many singular points but without locally dense orbits can be reconstruct by finite combinatorial structures, which are the multi-saddle connection diagram and the abstract multi-graph (S/v_{\mathrm{ex}})/\sim_E with labels. Moreover, though the set of topological equivalent classes of irrational rotations (i.e. minimal flows) on a torus is uncountable, the set of topological equivalent classes of non-wandering flows with finitely many singular points but without locally dense orbits on compact surfaces is enumerable by combinatorial structures algorithmically.
