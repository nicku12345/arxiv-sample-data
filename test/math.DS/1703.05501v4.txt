We construct a complete finite invariant for surface flows of finite type. In particular, the invariant is complete for Morse-Smale flows and "generic" Hamiltonian flows. In fact, although degeneracy of singular points implies uncountably many local topological equivalence classes and the set of topological equivalence classes of minimal flows (resp. Denjoy flows) on a torus is uncountable, we enumerate the set of topological equivalence classes of flows with at most finitely many limit cycles but without non-closed recurrent orbits or degenerate singular points on a compact surface using finite labelled graphs. To enumerate such flows, we describe properties of border points of a flow without degenerate singular points on a compact surface. In particular, we show that each connected component of the complement of the "ss-multi-saddle connection diagram" is either an open disk, an open annulus, a torus, a Klein bottle, an open M\"obius band, or an open essential subset consisting of locally dense orbits. Moreover, we generalize the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem for a flow with arbitrarily many singular points on a compact surface. In fact, the \omega-limit set of any non-closed orbit is either a nowhere dense subset of singular points, a limit cycle, a limit "quasi-circuit", a locally dense Q-set, or a "quasi-Q set". In addition, for such a surface flow, we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for the closure of the union of closed orbits corresponding to the non-wandering set.
