This paper examines a continuous time dynamical system that is an extension of a discrete time dynamical system previously examined, and considers this system together in a product space with a compact subset of Euclidean space. Together, the two systems give a skew product flow. We first examine limit behavior and recurrence in our continuous time extension. We then consider analogous limit and recurrence concepts for a skew product flow, and the behavior on the Euclidean space that results.
