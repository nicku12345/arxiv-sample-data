We introduce a parametrised family of maps \{S_{\eta}\}_{\eta \in [1,2]}, called symmetric doubling maps, defined on [-1,1] by S_\eta (x)=2x-d\eta, where d\in \{-1,0,1 \}. Each map S_\eta generates binary expansions with digits -1, 0 and 1. We study the frequency of the digit 0 in typical expansions as a function of the parameter \eta. The transformations S_\eta have a natural ergodic invariant measure \mu_\eta that is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. The frequency of the digit 0 is related to the measure \mu_{\eta}([-\frac12,\frac12]) by the Ergodic Theorem. We show that the density of \mu_\eta is piecewise smooth except for a set of parameters of zero Lebesgue measure and full Hausdorff dimension and give a full description of the structure of the maximal parameter intervals on which the density is piecewise smooth. We give an explicit formula for the frequency of the digit 0 in typical signed binary expansions on each of these parameter intervals and show that this frequency depends continuously on the parameter \eta. Moreover, it takes the value \frac23 only on the interval \big[ \frac65, \frac32\big] and it is strictly less than \frac23 on the remainder of the parameter space.
