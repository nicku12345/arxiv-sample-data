In this paper, we study the dynamics of a non-autonomous dynamical system (X,\mathbb{F}) generated by a sequence (f_n) of continuous self maps converging uniformly to f. We relate the dynamics of the non-autonomous system (X,\mathbb{F}) with the dynamics of (X,f). We prove that if the family \mathbb{F} commutes with f and (f_n) converges to f at a "sufficiently fast rate", many of the dynamical properties for the systems (X,\mathbb{F}) and (X,f) coincide. In the procees we establish equivalence of properties like equicontinuity, minimality and denseness of proximal pairs (cells) for the two systems. In addition, if \mathbb{F} is feeble open, we establish equivalence of properties like transitivity, weak mixing and various forms of sensitivities. We prove that feeble openness of \mathbb{F} is sufficient to establish equivalence of topological mixing for the two systems. We prove that if \mathbb{F} is feeble open, dynamics of the non-autonomous system on a compact interval exhibits any form of mixing if and only if (X,f) exhibits identical form of mixing. We also investigate dense periodicity for the two systems. We give examples to investigate sufficiency/necessity of the conditions imposed. In the process we derive weaker conditions under which the established dynamical relation (between the two systems (X,\mathbb{F}) and (X,f)) is preserved.
