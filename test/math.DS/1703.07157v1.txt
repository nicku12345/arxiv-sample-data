We consider the infinite one-sided sequence over alphabet \{a,b\} generated by the period-doubling substitution \sigma(a)=ab and \sigma(b)=aa, denoted by \mathbb{D}. Let r_p(\omega) be the p-th return word of factor \omega. The main result of this paper is twofold. (1) For any factor \omega in \mathbb{D}, the return word sequence \{r_p(\omega)\}_{p\geq1} is \Theta_1 or \Theta_2. Both of them are substitutive sequences and determined completely in this paper. (2) For any factor \omega in \Theta_1 (resp. \Theta_2), the return word sequence \{r_p(\omega)\}_{p\geq1} is still \Theta_1 or \Theta_2. We call it the reflexivity property of the return word sequence. As an application, we introduce a notion of spectrum for studying some typical combinatorial properties, such as separated, adjacent and overlapped.
