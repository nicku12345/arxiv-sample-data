Let (X,\mathfrak{B},\mu) be a Borel probability space. Let T_n: X\rightarrow X be a sequence of continuous transformations on X. Let \nu be a probability measure on X such that \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N (T_n)_\ast \nu \rightarrow \mu in the weak-\ast topology. Under general conditions, we show that for \nu almost every x\in X, the measures \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \delta_{T_n x} get equidistributed towards \mu if N is restricted to a set of full upper density. We present applications of these results to translates of closed orbits of Lie groups on homogeneous spaces. As a corollary, we prove equidistribution of exponentially sparse orbits of the horocycle flow on quotients of SL(2,\mathbb{R}), starting from every point in almost every direction.
