As defined by W. Thurston, the core entropy of a polynomial is the entropy of the restriction to its Hubbard tree. For each d >= 2, we study the core entropy as a function on the parameter space of polynomials of degree d, and prove it varies continuously both as a function of the combinatorial data and of the coefficients of the polynomials. This generalizes a conjecture of Thurston for quadratic polynomials.
