In this article, we characterize two kinds of exceptional orbits of the geodesic flow associated with the Modular surface in terms of a two-parameter family of continued fraction expansion of endpoints of the lifts to the hyperbolic plane of the corresponding geodesics. As a consequence, we obtain an extension of Dani correspondence between homogeneous dynamics and Diophantine approximation.
