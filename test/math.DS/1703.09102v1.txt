Let BS(1,n)= \langle a,b : a b a ^{-1} = b ^n\rangle be the solvable Baumslag-Solitar group, where n \geq 2. We study representations of BS(1, n) by planar orientation preserving homeomorphisms with linear diagonalizable conjugating element. That is, we consider orientation preserving homeomorphisms f, h: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 such that h f h^{-1} = f^n, for some  n\geq 2 and we assume that h is a linear diagonalizable transformation. Assuming that f has bounded displacement, we give examples or prove rigidity theorems depending on the eigenvalues of h and give applications to toral homeomorphisms.
