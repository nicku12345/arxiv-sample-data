In this paper we prove that translation structures for which the corresponding vertical translation flows is weakly mixing and disjoint with its inverse, form a G_\delta-dense set in every non-hyperelliptic connected component of the moduli space \mathcal M. This is in contrast to hyperelliptic case, where for every translation structure the associated vertical flow is isomorphic to its inverse. To prove the main result, we study limits of the off-diagonal 3-joinings of special representations of vertical translation flows. Moreover, we construct a locally defined continuous embedding of the moduli space into the space of measure-preserving flows to obtain the G_\delta-condition.
