In this paper, we consider an equivariant Hopf bifurcation of relative periodic solutions from relative equilibria in systems of functional differential equations respecting \Gamma \times S^1-spatial symmetries. The existence of branches of relative periodic solutions together with their symmetric classification is established using the equivariant twisted \Gamma\times S^1-degree with one free parameter. As a case study, we consider a delay differential model of coupled identical passively mode-locked semiconductor lasers with the dihedral symmetry group \Gamma=D_8.
