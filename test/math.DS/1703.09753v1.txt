We study the self-semiconjugations of the Tent-map f:\, x\mapsto 1-|2x-1| for x\in [0,\, 1]. We prove that each of these semi-conjugations \xi is piecewise linear. For any n\in \mathbb{N} we denote A_n = f^{-n}(0) and describe the maps \psi:\, A_n\rightarrow [0,\, 1] such that \psi\circ f = f\circ \psi. Also we describe all possible restrictions, of self-semiconjugations of the Tent-map onto A_n and prove that for any \alpha\in A_n\setminus A_{n-1} a restriction is completely determined by its value at \alpha.
