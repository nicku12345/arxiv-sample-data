We construct a planar homogeneous self-similar measure, with strong separation, dense rotations and dimension greater than 1, such that there exist lines for which dimension conservation does not hold and the projection of the measure is singular. In fact, the set of such directions is residual and the typical slices of the measure, perpendicular to these directions, are discrete.
