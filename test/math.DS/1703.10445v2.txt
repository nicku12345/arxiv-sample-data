We study minimality for continuous actions of abelian semigroups on compact Hausdorff spaces with a free interval. First, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for such a space to admit a minimal action of a given abelian semigroup. Further, for actions of abelian semigroups we provide a trichotomy for the topological structure of minimal sets intersecting a free interval.
