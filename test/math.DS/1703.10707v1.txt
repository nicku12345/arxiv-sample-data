We consider a family of axisymmetric curves evolving by its mean curvature with driving force in the half space. We impose a boundary condition that the curves are perpendicular to the boundary for t>0, however, the initial curve intersects the boundary tangentially. In other words, the initial curve is oriented singularly. We investigate this problem by level set method and give some criteria to judge whether the interface evolution is fattening or not. In the end, we can classify the solutions into three categories and provide the asymptotic behavior in each category. Our main tools in this paper are level set method and intersection number principle.
