We prove the upper semicontinuity of the measure theoretic entropy for the geodesic flow on complete Riemannian manifolds without focal points and bounded sectional curvature. We then study the relationship between the escape of mass phenomenon and the measure theoretic entropy on finite volume nonpositively curved manifolds satisfying the Visibility axiom. We provide a general criterion for the same relation to hold between the escape of mass and the measure theoretic entropy. This gives a criterion for the existence of measures of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow on some nonpositively curved manifolds. Finally, we prove some results in the context of countable Markov shifts.
