We study in this paper several properties concerning singularities of foliations in (\mathbb{C}^3,\mathbf{0}) that are pull-back of dicritical foliations in (\mathbb{C}^2,\mathbf{0}). Particularly, we will investigate the existence of first integrals (holomorphic and meromorphic) and the dicriticalness of such a foliation. In the study of meromorphic first integrals we follow the same method used by R. Meziani and P. Sad in dimension two. While the foliations we study are pull-back of foliations in (\mathbb{C}^2,\mathbf{0}), the adaptations are not straightforward.
