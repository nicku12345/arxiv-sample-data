We study the action of the affine group G of \mathbb{R}^d on the space X_{k,\,d} of k-dimensional affine subspaces. Given a compactly-supported Zariski dense probability measure \mu on G, we show that X_{k,\,d} supports a \mu-stationary measure \nu if and only if the (k\!+\!1)^{\rm th}-Lyapunov exponent of \mu is strictly negative. In particular, when \mu is symmetric, \nu exists if and only if 2k\geq d.
