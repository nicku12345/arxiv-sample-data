Identity-homotopic self-homeomorphisms of a space of non-periodic 1-dimensional tiling are generalizations of orientation-preserving self-homeomorphisms of circles. We define the analogue of rotation numbers for such maps. In constrast to the classical situation, additional assumptions are required to make rotation numbers globally well-defined and independent of initial conditions. We prove that these conditions are sufficient, and provide counterexamples when these conditions are not met.
