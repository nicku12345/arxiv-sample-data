Let \pi\colon T\times X\rightarrow X with phase map (t,x)\mapsto tx, denoted (\pi,T,X), be a \textit{semiflow} on a compact Hausdorff space X with phase semigroup T. If each t\in T is onto, (\pi,T,X) is called surjective; and if each t\in T is 1-1 onto (\pi,T,X) is called invertible and in latter case it induces \pi^{-1}\colon X\times T\rightarrow X by (x,t)\mapsto xt:=t^{-1}x, denoted (\pi^{-1},X,T). In this paper, we show that (\pi,T,X) is equicontinuous surjective iff it is uniformly distal iff (\pi^{-1},X,T) is equicontinuous surjective. As applications of this theorem, we also consider the minimality, distality, and sensitivity of (\pi^{-1},X,T) if (\pi,T,X) is invertible with these dynamics. We also study the pointwise recurrence and Gottschalk's weak almost periodicity of \mathbb{Z}-flow with compact zero-dimensional phase space.
