We study the set of p-adic Gibbs measures of the q-states Potts model on the Cayley tree of order three. We prove the vastness of the periodic p-adic Gibbs measures for such model by showing the chaotic behavior of the correspondence Potts--Bethe mapping over \mathbb{Q}\_p for p\equiv 1 \ (\rm{mod} \ 3). In fact, for 0 < |\theta-1|\_p < |q|\_p^2 < 1, there exists a subsystem that isometrically conjugate to the full shift on three symbols. Meanwhile, for 0 < |q|\_p^2 \leq |\theta-1|\_p < |q|\_p < 1, there exists a subsystem that isometrically conjugate to a subshift of finite type on r symbols where r \geq 4. However, these subshifts on r symbols are all topologically conjugate to the full shift on three symbols. The p-adic Gibbs measures of the same model for the cases p=2,3 and the corresponding Potts--Bethe mapping are also discussed.Furthermore, for 0 < |\theta-1|\_p < |q|\_p < 1, we remark that the Potts--Bethe mapping is not chaotic when p=2,\ p=3 and p\equiv 2 \ (\rm{mod} \ 3) and we could not conclude the vastness of the periodic p-adic Gibbs measures. In a forthcoming paper with the same title, we will treat the case 0 < |q|\_p \leq |\theta-1|\_p < 1 for all p.
