For transitive shifts of finite type, and more generally for shifts with specification, it is well-known that every equilibrium state for a Holder continuous potential has positive entropy as long as the shift has positive topological entropy. We give a non-uniform specification condition under which this property continues to hold, and demonstrate that it does not necessarily hold for other non-uniform versions of specification that have been introduced elsewhere.
