In this paper we provide a new method to study global dynamics of planar quasi--homogeneous differential systems. We first prove that all planar quasi--homogeneous polynomial differential systems can be translated into homogeneous differential systems and show that all quintic quasi--homogeneous but non--homogeneous systems can be reduced to four homogeneous ones. Then we present some properties of homogeneous systems, which can be used to discuss the dynamics of quasi--homogeneous systems. Finally we characterize the global topological phase portraits of quintic quasi--homogeneous but non--homogeneous differential systems.
