This paper is devoted to the examination of the properties of the string construction for the Birkhoff billiard. Based on purely geometric considerations, string construction is suited to provide a table for the Birkhoff billiard, having the prescribed caustic. Exploiting this framework together with the properties of convex caustics, we give a geometric proof of a result by Innami first proved in 2002 by means of Aubry-Mather theory. In the second part of the paper we show that applying the string construction one can find a new collection of examples of C^2-smooth convex billiard tables with a non-smooth convex caustic.
