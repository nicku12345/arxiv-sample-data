We study the dynamics of SL_3(\mathbb{R}) and its subgroups on the homogeneous space X consisting of homothety classes of rank-2 discrete subgroups of \mathbb{R}^3. We focus on the case where the acting group is Zariski dense in either SL_3(\mathbb{R}) or SO(2,1)(\mathbb{R}). Using techniques of Benoist and Quint we prove that for a compactly supported probability measure \mu on SL_3(\mathbb{R}) whose support generates a group which is Zariski dense in SL_3(\mathbb{R}), there exists a unique \mu-stationary probability measure on X. When the Zariski closure is SO(2,1)(\mathbb{R}) we establish a certain dichotomy regarding stationary measures and discover a surprising phenomenon: The Poisson boundary can be embedded in X. The embedding is of algebraic nature and raises many natural open problems. Furthermore, motivating applications to questions in the geometry of numbers are discussed.
