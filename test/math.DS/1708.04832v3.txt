Suppose X is a finite discrete space with at least two elements, \Gamma is a nonempty countable set, and consider self--map \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma. We prove that the generalized shift \sigma_\varphi:X^\Gamma\to X^\Gamma with \sigma_\varphi((x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\Gamma})=(x_{\varphi(\alpha)})_{\alpha\in\Gamma} (for (x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\Gamma}\in X^\Gamma) is:   \bullet distributional chaotic (uniform, type 1, type 2) if and only if \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma has at least a non-quasi-periodic point,   \bullet dense distributional chaotic if and only if \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma does not have any periodic point,   \bullet transitive distributional chaotic if and only if \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma is one--to--one without any periodic point.   We complete the text by counterexamples.
