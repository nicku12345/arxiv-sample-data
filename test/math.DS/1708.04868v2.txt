Our main aim is to characterize Li-Yorke sensitivity and sensitivity of the generalized shift dynamical system (X^\Gamma,\sigma_\varphi) for finite discrete X with at least two elements, nonempty countable \Gamma and self-map \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma. We prove that the following statements are equivalent:   \bullet the generalized shift dynamical system (X^\Gamma,\sigma_\varphi) is Li-Yorke sensitive;   \bullet the generalized shift dynamical system (X^\Gamma,\sigma_\varphi) is spatiotemporally chaotic;   \bullet the generalized shift dynamical system (X^\Gamma,\sigma_\varphi) is dense chaotic;   \bullet the map \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma does not have any periodic point.   Also we see that (X^\Gamma,\sigma_\varphi) is sensitive (resp. strongly sensitive) if and only if \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma has at least one non-quasi periodic point.
