This paper studies a class of complex-valued linear systems whose state evolution dependents on both the state vector and its conjugate. The complex-valued linear system comes from linear dynamical quantum control theory and is also encountered when a normal linear system is controlled by feedback containing both the state vector and its conjugate that can provide more design freedom. By introducing the concept of bimatrix and its properties, the considered system is transformed into an equivalent real-representation system and a non-equivalent complex-lifting system, which are normal linear systems. Some analysis and design problems including solutions, controllability, observability, stability, eigenvalue assignment, stabilization, linear quadratic regulation (LQR), and state observer design are then investigated. Criterion, conditions, and algorithms are provided in terms of the coefficient bimatrices of the original system. The developed approaches are also utilized to investigate the so-called antilinear system which is a special case of the considered complex-valued linear system. The existing results on this system have been improved and some new results are established.
