We identify a family of numbers for which the Bernoulli convolution is singular. Within this family we find two countable collections of Salem numbers in the interval (1,2), and another Salem number and an algebraic integer that is neither Pisot nor Salem in (1,2). It also contains a non-Pisot, non-Salem algebraic number bigger than 3. Hence, we provide the first new explicit examples of singular Bernoulli convolutions since the work of Erd\H{o}s in 1939.
