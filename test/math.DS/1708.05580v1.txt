The Mackey--Glass equation, which was proposed to illustrate nonlinear phenomena in physiological control systems, is a classical example of a simple looking time delay system with very complicated behavior. Here we use a novel approach for chaos control: we prove that with well chosen control parameters, all solutions of the system can be forced into a domain where the feedback is monotone, and by the powerful theory of delay differential equations with monotone feedback we can guarantee that the system is not chaotic any more. We show that this domain decomposition method is applicable with the most common control terms. Furthermore, we propose an other chaos control scheme based on state dependent delays.
