For a general discrete dynamics on a Banach and Hilbert spaces we give a necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of bounded solutions under assumption that the homogeneous difference equation admits an exponential dichotomy on the semi-axes. We consider the so called resonance (critical) case when the uniqueness of solution is disturbed. We show that admissibility can be reformulated in the terms of generalised or pseudoinvertibility. As an application we consider the case when the corresponding dynamical system is e-trichotomy.
