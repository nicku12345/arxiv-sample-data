We prove that every \mathbb{Z}^{k}-action (X,\mathbb{Z}^{k},T) of mean dimension less than D/2 admitting a factor (Y,\mathbb{Z}^{k},S) of Rokhlin dimension not greater than L embeds in (([0,1]^{(L+1)D})^{\mathbb{Z}^{k}}\times Y,\sigma\times S), where D\in\mathbb{N}, L\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\} and \sigma is the shift on the Hilbert cube ([0,1]^{(L+1)D})^{\mathbb{Z}^{k}}; in particular, when (Y,\mathbb{Z}^{k},S) is an irrational \mathbb{Z}^{k}-rotation on the k-torus, (X,\mathbb{Z}^{k},T) embeds in (([0,1]^{2^kD+1})^{\mathbb{Z}^k},\sigma), which is compared to a previous result by the first named author, Lindenstrauss and Tsukamoto. Moreover, we give a complete and detailed proof of Takens' embedding theorem with a continuous observable for \mathbb{Z}-actions and deduce the analogous result for \mathbb{Z}^{k}-actions. Lastly, we show that the Lindenstrauss--Tsukamoto conjecture for \mathbb{Z}-actions holds generically, discuss an analogous conjecture for \mathbb{Z}^{k}-actions appearing in a forthcoming paper by the first two authors and Tsukamoto and verify it for \mathbb{Z}^{k}-actions on finite dimensional spaces.
