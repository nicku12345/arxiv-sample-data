In this paper, the fractional order Hegselmann-Krause type model with leadership is studied.We seek an optimal control strategy for the system to reach a consensus in such a way that the control mechanism is included in the leader dynamics. Necessary optimality conditions are obtained by the use of a fractional counterpart of Pontryagin Maximum Principle. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is illustrated by numerical examples.
