Suppose (X,\sigma) is a subshift, P_X(n) is the word complexity function of X, and {\rm Aut}(X) is the group of automorphisms of X. We show that if P_X(n)=o(n^2/\log^2 n), then {\rm Aut}(X) is amenable (as a countable, discrete group). We further show that if P_X(n)=o(n^2), then {\rm Aut}(X) can never contain a nonabelian free semigroup (and, in particular, can never contain a nonabelian free subgroup). This is in contrast to recent examples, due to Salo and Schraudner, of subshifts with quadratic complexity that do contain such a semigroup.
