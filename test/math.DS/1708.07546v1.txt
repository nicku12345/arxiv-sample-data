In this paper, we study the integrability and linearization of a class of quadratic quasi-analytic switching systems. We improve an existing method to compute the focus values and periodic constants of quasi-analytic switching systems. In particular, with our method, we demonstrate that the dynamical behaviors of quasi-analytic switching systems are more complex than that of continuous quasi-analytic systems, by showing the existence of six and seven limit cycles in the neighborhood of the origin and infinity, respectively, in a quadratic quasi-analytic switching system. Moreover, explicit conditions are obtained for classifying the centers and isochronous centers of the system.
