We identify two rather novel types of (compound) dynamical bifurcations generated primarily by interactions of an invariant attracting submanifold with stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic fixed points. These bifurcation types - inspired by recent investigations of mathematical models for walking droplet (pilot-wave) phenomena - are introduced and illustrated. Some of the one-parameter bifurcation types are analyzed in detail and extended from the plane to higher-dimensional spaces. A few applications to walking droplet dynamics are analyzed.
