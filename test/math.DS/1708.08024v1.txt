We study the analyticity of bounded solutions of systems of analytic state-dependent delay differential equations. We obtain the analyticity of solutions by transforming the system of state-dependent delay equations into an abstract ordinary differential equation in a subspace of the sequence space l^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}) and prove the existence of complex extension of the bounded solutions. An example is given to illustrate the general results.
