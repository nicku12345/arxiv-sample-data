In this paper, we explore the construction and dynamical properties of \mathcal{S}-limited shifts. An S-limited shift is a subshift defined on a finite alphabet \mathcal{A} = \{1, \ldots,p\} by a set \mathcal{S} = \{S_1, \ldots, S_p\}, where S_i \subseteq \mathbb{N} describes the allowable lengths of blocks in which the corresponding letter may appear. We give conditions for which an \mathcal{S}-limited shift is a subshift of finite type or sofic. We give an exact formula for finding the entropy of such a shift and show that an \mathcal{S}-limited shift and its factors must be intrinsically ergodic. Finally, we give some conditions for which two such shifts can be conjugate, and additional information about conjugate \mathcal{S}-limited shifts.
