The linear fractional map  g(z) = \frac{az+ b}{cz + d}  on the Riemann sphere with complex coefficients  ad-bc = 1  is and  a+d = \pm 2 , then  g  is called {\em parabolic} M\"obius map. Let  \{ b_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0}  be the solution of the parabolic M\"obius difference equation  b_{n+1} = g(b_n)  for every  n \in \mathbb{N}_0 . We show that the sequence  \{ b_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0}  has no Hyers-Ulam stability.
