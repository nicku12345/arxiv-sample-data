Hyers-Ulam stability of the difference equation with the initial point  z_0  as follows  z_{i+1} = \frac{az_i + b}{cz_i + d}  is investigated for complex numbers  a,b,c  and  d  where  ad - bc = 1 ,  c \neq 0  and a + d \in \mathbb{R} \setminus [-2,2] . The stability of the sequence  \{z_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0}  holds if the initial point is in the exterior of a certain disk of which center is  -\frac{d}{c} . Furthermore, the region for stability can be extended to the complement of some neighborhood of the line segment between  -\frac{d}{c}  and the repelling fixed point of the map  z \mapsto \frac{az + b}{cz + d} . This result is the generalization of Hyers-Ulam stability of Pielou logistic equation.
