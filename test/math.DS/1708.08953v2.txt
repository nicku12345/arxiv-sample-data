We study shrinking targets problems for discrete time flows on a homogenous space \Gamma\backslash G with G a semisimple group and \Gamma an irreducible lattice. Our results apply to both diagonalizable and unipotent flows, and apply to very general families of shrinking targets. As a special case, we establish logarithm laws for cusp excursions of unipotent flows answering a question of Athreya and Margulis.
