We establish a Garden of Eden theorem for expansive algebraic actions of amenable groups with the weak specification property, i.e. for any continuous equivariant map T from the underlying space to itself, T is pre-injective if and only if it is surjective. In particular, this applies to all expansive principal algebraic actions of amenable groups and expansive algebraic actions of Z^d with CPE.
