Let H(q,p) = \frac12 | p |^2 + V(q) be an n-degree of freedom C^r mechanical Hamiltonian on the cotangent bundle of the n-torus where r>2n+2. When the metric | * | is flat, the Nos\'e-thermostated system associated to H is shown to have a positive-measure set of invariant tori near the infinite temperature limit. This is shown to be true for all variable mass thermostats similar to Nos\'e's, too. These results complement results of Legoll, Luskin & Moeckel and the author.
