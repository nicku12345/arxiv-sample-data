We study the properties of `infinite-volume mixing' for two classes of intermittent maps: expanding maps [0,1] \longrightarrow [0,1] with an indifferent fixed point at 0 preserving an infinite, absolutely continuous measure, and expanding maps \mathbb{R}^+ \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ with an indifferent fixed point at +\infty preserving the Lebesgue measure. All maps have full branches. While certain properties are easily adjudicated, the so-called global-local mixing, namely the decorrelation of a global and a local observable, is harder to prove. We do this for two subclasses of systems. The first subclass includes, among others, the Farey map. The second class includes the standard Pomeau-Manneville map x \mapsto x+x^2 mod 1. Morevoer, we use global-local mixing to prove certain limit theorems for our intermittent maps.
