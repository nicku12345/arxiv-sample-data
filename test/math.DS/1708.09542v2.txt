In this paper, we investigate a delayed reaction-diffusion-advection equation, which models the population dynamics in the advective heterogeneous environment. The existence of the nonconstant positive steady state and associated Hopf bifurcation are obtained. A weighted inner product associated with the advection rate is introduced to compute the normal forms, which is the main difference between Hopf bifurcation for delayed reaction-diffusion-advection model and that for delayed reaction-diffusion model. Moreover, we find that the spatial scale and advection can affect Hopf bifurcation in the heterogenous environment.
