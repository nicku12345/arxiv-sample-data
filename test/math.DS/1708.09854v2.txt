In this article we show that for every collection \mathcal{C} of an even number of polynomials, all of the same degree d>2 and in general position, there exist two hyperbolic 3-orbifolds M_1 and M_2 with a M\"obius morphism \alpha:M_1\rightarrow M_2 such that the restriction of \alpha to the boundaries \partial M_1 and \partial M_2 forms a collection of maps Q in the same conformal Hurwitz class of the initial collection \mathcal{C}. Also, we discuss the relationship between conformal Hurwitz classes of rational maps and classes of continuous isomorphisms of sandwich products on the set of rational maps.
