We prove that for any non-trivial perturbation depending on any two independent harmonics of a pendulum and a rotor there is global instability. The proof is based on the geometrical method and relies on the concrete computation of several scattering maps. A complete description of the different kinds of scattering maps taking place as well as the existence of piecewise smooth global scattering maps is also provided.
