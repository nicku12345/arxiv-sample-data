We prove an inequality relating the norm of a product of matrices A_n\cdots A_1 with the spectral radii of subproducts A_j\cdots A_i with 1\leq i\leq j\leq n. Among the consequences of this inequality, we obtain the classical Berger-Wang formula as an immediate corollary, and give an easier proof of a characterization of the upper Lyapunov exponent due to I. Morris. As main ingredient for the proof of this result, we prove that for a large enough n, the product A_n\cdots A_1 is zero under the hypothesis that A_j\cdots A_i are nilpotent for all 1\leq i \leq j\leq n.
