We describe the equivalence classes of germs of generic 2-parameter families of complex vector fields \dot z = \omega_\epsilon(z) on \mathbb{C} unfolding a singular parabolic point of multiplicity k+1: \omega_0= z^{k+1} +o(z^{k+1}). The equivalence is under conjugacy by holomorphic change of coordinate and parameter. As a preparatory step, we present the bifurcation diagram of the family of vector fields \dot z = z^{k+1} + \epsilon_1 z + \epsilon_0 over \mathbb{CP}^1. This presentation is done using the new tools of periodgon and star domain. We then provide a description of the modulus space and (almost) unique normal forms for the equivalence classes of germs.
