This work focuses on the existence of quasi-periodic solutions for ordinary and delay differential equations (ODEs and DDEs for short) with an elliptic-type degenerate equilibrium point under quasi-periodic perturbations. We prove that under appropriate hypotheses there exist quasi-periodic solutions for perturbed ODEs and DDEs near the equilibrium point for most parameter values, then apply these results to the delayed van der Pol's oscillator with zero-Hopf singularity.
