We consider a class of singular ordinary differential equations describing analytic systems of arbitrary finite dimension, subject to a quasi-periodic forcing term and in the presence of dissipation. We study the existence of response solutions, i.e. quasi-periodic solutions with the same frequency vector as the forcing term, in the case of large dissipation. We assume the system to be conservative in the absence dissipation, so that the forcing term is --- up to the sign --- the gradient of a potential energy, and both the mass and damping matrices to be symmetric and positive definite. Further, we assume a non-degeneracy condition on the forcing term, essentially that the time-average of the potential energy has a strict local minimum. On the contrary, no condition is assumed on the forcing frequency; in particular we do not require any Diophantine condition. We prove that, under the assumptions above, a response solution always exist provided the dissipation is strong enough. This extends results previously available in literature in the one-dimensional case.
