Let ({\Sigma}, g) be a compact C^2 finslerian 3-manifold. If the geodesic flow of g is completely integrable, and the singular set is a tamely-embedded polyhedron, then {\pi}_1({\Sigma}) is almost polycyclic. On the other hand, if {\Sigma} is a compact, irreducible 3-manifold and {\pi}_1({\Sigma}) is infinite polycyclic while {\pi}_2({\Sigma}) is trivial, then {\Sigma} admits an analytic riemannian metric whose geodesic flow is completely integrable and singular set is a real-analytic variety. Additional results in higher dimensions are proven.
