Using the combinatorial properties of subsets of integers, a classification of metric dynamical systems was given in [V. Bergelson and T. Downarowicz, Large sets of integers and hierarchy of mixing properties of measure-preserving systems, Colloquium Mathematicum, 110(1), (2008), 117-150]. As a result, some new families emerged. Here, their counterparts in topological dynamics has been considered. The differences will be discussed and new classes of systems in topological dynamics will be introduced.
