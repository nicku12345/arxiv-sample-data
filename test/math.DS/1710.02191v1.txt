For a discrete dynamics defined by a sequence of bounded and not necessarily invertible linear operators, we give a complete characterization of exponential stability in terms of invertibility of a certain operator acting on suitable Banach sequence spaces. We connect the invertibility of this operator to the existence of a particular type of admissible exponents. For the bounded orbits, exponential stability results from a spectral property. Some adequate examples are presented to emphasize some significant qualitative differences between uniform and nonuniform behavior.
