We give a review of results on superpolynomial decay of correlations, and polynomial decay of correlations for nonuniformly expanding semiflows and nonuniformly hyperbolic flows. A self-contained proof is given for semiflows. Results for flows are stated without proof (the proofs are contained in separate joint work with Balint and Butterley). Applications include intermittent solenoidal flows, suspended Henon attractors, Lorenz attractors, and various Lorentz gas models including the infinite horizon Lorentz gas.
