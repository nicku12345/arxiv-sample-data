Unstable pressure and u-equilibrium states are introduced and investigated for a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphsim f. We define the u-pressure P^u(f, \varphi) of f at a continuous function \varphi via the dynamics of f on local unstable leaves. A variational principle for unstable pressure P^u(f, \varphi), which states that P^u(f, \varphi) is the supremum of the sum of the unstable entropy and the integral of \varphi taken over all invariant measures, is obtained. U-equilibrium states at which the supremum in the variational principle attains and their relation to Gibbs u-states are studied. Differentiability properties of unstable pressure, such as tangent functionals, Gateaux differentiability and Fr\'{e}chet differentiability and their relations to u-equilibrium states, are also considered.
