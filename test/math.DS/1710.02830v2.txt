We discuss limit distributions for hitting-time functions of certain exceptional families of asymptotically rare events for ergodic probability preserving transformations. The abstract core is an inducing argument. The latter applies, for example, to shrinking intervals around periodic points (both uniformly expanding and neutral) of certain finite measure preserving interval maps. In particular, we give a complete answer to a question raised in [FFTV].
