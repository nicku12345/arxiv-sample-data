For every group G, we show that either G has a topologically transitive action on the line \mathbb R by orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, or every orientation-preserving action of G on \mathbb R has a wandering interval. According to this result, all groups are divided into two types: transitive type and wandering type, and the types of several groups are determined. We also show that every finitely generated orderable group of wandering type is indicable. As a corollary, we show that if a higher rank lattice \Gamma is orderable, then \Gamma is of transitive type.
