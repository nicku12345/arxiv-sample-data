We give examples of endomorphisms in dimension one with infinite topological entropy which are \alpha-H\"older and (1,p)-Sobolev for all 0\leq\alpha<1 and 1\leq p<\infty. This is constructed within a family of endomorphisms with infinite topological entropy and which traverse all \alpha-H\"older and (1,p)-Sobolev classes. Finally, we also give examples of endomorphisms, also in dimension one, which lie in the big and little Zygmund classes, answering a question of M. Benedicks.
