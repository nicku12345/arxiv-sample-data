This paper surveys some recent results concerning the dynamics of two families of holomorphic correspondences, namely {\mathcal F}_a:z \to w defined by the relation \left( \frac{aw-1}{w-1} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{aw-1}{w-1} \right) \left( \frac{az +1}{z+1} \right) + \left( \frac{az+1}{z+1} \right)^2 =3, and \mathbf{f}_c(z)=z^{\beta} +c, \mbox{ where } 1<\beta=p/q \in \mathbb{Q}, which is the correspondence \mathbf{f}_c:z \to w defined by the relation (w-c)^q=z^p. Both can be regarded as generalizations of the family of quadratic maps f_c(z)=z^2+c. We describe dynamical properties for the family \mathcal{F}_a which parallel properties enjoyed by quadratic polynomials, in particular a B\"ottcher map, periodic geodesics and Yoccoz inequality, and we give a detailed account of the very recent theory of holomorphic motions for hyperbolic multifunctions in the family {\bf f}_c.
