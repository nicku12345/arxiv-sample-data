We present two generalizations of the popular diffusion maps algorithm. The first generalization replaces the drift term in diffusion maps, which is the gradient of the sampling density, with the gradient of an arbitrary density of interest which is known up to a normalization constant. The second generalization allows for a diffusion map type approximation of the forward and backward generators of general Ito diffusions with given drift and diffusion coefficients. We use the local kernels introduced by Berry and Sauer, but allow for arbitrary sampling densities. We provide numerical illustrations to demonstrate that this opens up many new applications for diffusion maps as a tool to organize point cloud data, including biased or corrupted samples, dimension reduction for dynamical systems, detection of almost invariant regions in flow fields, and importance sampling.
