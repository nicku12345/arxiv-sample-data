We study attracting graphs of step skew products from the topological and ergodic points of view where the usual contracting-like assumptions of the fiber dynamics are replaced by weaker merely topological conditions. In this context, we prove the existence of an attracting invariant graph and study its topological properties. We prove the existence of globally attracting measures and we show that (in some specific cases) the rate of convergence to these measures is exponential.
