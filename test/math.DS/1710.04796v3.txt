In this paper, we study the maximum number, denoted by H(m,n), of hyperelliptic limit cycles of the Li\'enard systems   \dot x=y, \qquad \dot y=-f_m(x)y-g_n(x), where, respectively, f_m(x) and g_n(x) are real polynomials of degree m and n, g_n(0)=0. The main results of the paper are as follows: In term of m and n of the system, we obtain the upper bound and lower bound of H(m,n) in all the possible cases. Furthermore, these upper bound can be reached in some cases.
