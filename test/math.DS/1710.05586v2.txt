We consider generalized interval exchange transformations, or briefly GIETs, that is bijections of the interval which are piecewise increasing homeomorphisms with finite branches. When all continuous branches are translations, such maps are classical interval exchange transformations, or briefly IETs. The well-known Rauzy renormalization procedure extends to a given GIET and a Rauzy renormalization path is defined, provided that the map is infinitely renormalizable. We define full families of GIETs, that is optimal finite dimensional parameter families of GIETs such that any prescribed Rauzy renormalization path is realized by some map in the family. In particular, a GIET and a IET with the same Rauzy renormalization path are semi-conjugated. This extends a classical result of Poincar\'e relating circle homeomorphisms and irrational rotations.
