Let X be a two-sided subshift on a finite alphabet endowed with a mixing probability measure which is positive on all cylinders in X. We show that there exist arbitrarily small finite overlapping union of shifted cylinders which intersect every orbit under the shift map.   We also show that for any proper subshift Y of X there exists a finite overlapping unions of shifted cylinders such that its survivor set contains Y (in particular, it can have entropy arbitrarily close to the entropy of X). Both results may be seen as somewhat counter-intuitive.   Finally, we apply these results to a certain class of hyperbolic algebraic automorphisms of a torus.
