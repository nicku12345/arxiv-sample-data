We consider a \mathcal{C}^3 family t\mapsto f_t of \mathcal{C}^4 Anosov diffeomorphisms on a compact Riemannian manifold M. Denoting by \rho_t the SRB measure of f_t, we prove that the map t\mapsto\int \theta d\rho_t is differentiable if \theta is of the form \theta(x)=h(x)\delta(g(x)-a), with \delta the Dirac distribution, g:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R} a \mathcal{C}^4 function, h:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R} a \mathcal{C}^3 function and a a regular value of g. We also require a transversality condition, namely that the intersection of the support of h with the level set \{g(x)=a\}  is foliated by 'admissible stable leaves'.
