We address the following conjecture about the existence of common zeros for commuting vector fields in dimension three: if X,Y are two C^1 commuting vector fields on a 3-manifold M, and U is a relatively compact open such that X does not vanish on the boundary of U and has a non vanishing Poincar\'e-Hopf index in U, then X and Y have a common zero inside U. We prove this conjecture when X and Y are of class C^3 and every periodic orbit of Y along which X and Y are collinear is partially hyperbolic. We also prove the conjecture, still in the C^3 setting, assuming that the flow Y leaves invariant a transverse plane field. These results shed new light on the C^3 case of the conjecture.
