In this paper we describe the topological behavior of the geodesic flow for a class of closed 3-manifolds realized as quotients of nonstrictly convex Hilbert geometries, constructed and described explicitly by Benoist. These manifolds are Finsler geometries which have isometrically embedded flats, but also some hyperbolicity and an explicit geometric structure. We prove the geodesic flow of the quotient is topologically mixing and satisfies a nonuniform Anosov closing lemma, with applications to entropy and orbit counting. We also prove entropy-expansiveness for the geodesic flow of any compact quotient of a Hilbert geometry.
