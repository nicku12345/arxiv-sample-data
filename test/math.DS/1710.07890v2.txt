Inspired by the works of Zagier, we study the probability measures \nu(t) with support on the flat tori which are the compact orbits of the maximal unipotent subgroup acting holomorphically on the positive orthonormal frame bundle \mathcal{F}({M}_D) of 3-dimensional hyperbolic Bianchi orbifolds {M}_D=\mathbb{H}^3/\widetilde{\Gamma}_D, of finite volume and with only one cusp. Here \Gamma_D=PSL(2, \mathcal{O}), where \mathcal{O} is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field of class number one.
