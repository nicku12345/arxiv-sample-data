We study how physical measures vary with the underlying dynamics in the open class of C^r, r>1, strong partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms for which the central Lyapunov exponents of every Gibbs u-state is positive. If transitive, such a diffeomorphism has a unique physical measure that persists and varies continuously with the dynamics.   A main ingredient in the proof is a new Pliss-like Lemma which, under the right circumstances, yields frequency of hyperbolic times close to one. Another novelty is the introduction of a new characterization of Gibbs cu-states. Both of these may be of independent interest.   The non-transitive case is also treated: here the number of physical measures varies upper semi-continuously with the diffeomorphism, and physical measures vary continuously whenever possible.
