We establish a closing property for thin trapped homoclinic classes. Taking advantage of this property, we proved that if the homoclinic class H(p) admits a dominated splitting T_{H(p)}M=E\oplus_{<}F, where E is thin trapped (see Definition \ref{Def:TP}) and all periodic points homoclinically related to p are uniformly F-expanding at the period (see Definition \ref{Def:expanding}), then F is expanded (see Definition \ref{Def:TP}).
