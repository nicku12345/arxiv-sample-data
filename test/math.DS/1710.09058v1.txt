The Chirikov standard map family is a one-parameter family of volume-preserving maps exhibiting hyperbolicity on a `large' but noninvariant subset of phase space. Based on this predominant hyperbolicity and numerical experiments, it is anticipated that the standard map has positive metric entropy for many parameter values. However, rigorous analysis is notoriously difficult, and it remains an open question whether the standard map has positive metric entropy for any parameter value. Here we study a problem of intermediate difficulty: compositions of standard maps with increasing parameter. When the coefficients increase to infinity at a sufficiently fast polynomial rate, we obtain a Strong Law, Central Limit Theorem, and quantitative mixing estimate for Holder observables. The methods used are not specific to the standard map and apply to a class of compositions of `prototypical' 2D maps with hyperbolicity on `most' of phase space.
