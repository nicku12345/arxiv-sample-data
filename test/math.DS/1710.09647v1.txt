Ma\~n\'e (1979) proved that if a compact metric space admits an expansive homeomorphism then it is finite dimensional. We generalize this theorem to multiparameter actions. The generalization involves mean dimension theory, which counts "averaged dimension" of a dynamical system. We prove that if T:\mathbb{Z}^k\times X\to X is expansive and if R:\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}\times X\to X commutes with T then R has finite mean dimension. When k=1, this statement reduces to Ma\~{n}\'{e}'s theorem. We also study several related issues, especially the connection with entropy theory.
