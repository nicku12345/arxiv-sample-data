We prove local limit theorems for a cocycle over a semiflow by establishing topological, mixing properties of the associated skew product semiflow. We also establish conditional rational weak mixing of certain skew product semiflows and various mixing properties including order 2 rational weak mixing of hyperbolic geodesic flows of cyclic covers.
