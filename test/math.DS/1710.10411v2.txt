We study the Turing-Hopf bifurcation and give a simple and explicit calculation formula of the normal forms for a general two-components system of reaction-diffusion equation with time delays. We declare that our formula can be automated by Matlab. At first, we extend the normal forms method given by Faria in 2000 to Hopf-zero singularity. Then, an explicit formula of the normal forms for Turing-Hopf bifurcation are given. Finally, we obtain the possible attractors of the original system near the Turing-Hopf singularity by the further analysis of the normal forms, which mainly include, the spatially non-homogeneous steady-state solutions, periodic solutions and quasi-periodic solutions.
