Since the basic theoretical framework of generalized Hamilton system is not perfect and complete, there are often some practical problems that can not be expressed by generalized Hamilton system. The generalized gradient operator is defined by the structure function on manifold to improve the basic theoretical framework of the whole generalized Hamilton system. The generalized structure Poisson bracket is defined as well on manifolds. The geometric bracket is also given, and the covariant extension form of the generalized Hamilton system directly related to the structure function, the generalized covariance, is further obtained--generalized covariant Hamilton system, It includes thorough generalized Hamiltonian system and S-dynamic system.
