In this paper we give an elementary treatment of the dynamics of skew tent maps. We divide the two-parameter space into six regions. Two of these regions are further subdivided into infinitely many regions. All of the regions are given explicitly. We find the attractor in each subregion, determine whether the attractor is a periodic orbit or is chaotic, and also determine the asymptotic fate of every point. We find that when the attractor is chaotic, it is either a single interval or the disjoint union of a finite number of intervals; when it is a periodic orbit, all periods are possible. Sometimes, besides the attractor, there exists an invariant chaotic Cantor set.
