We consider a space \mathcal{U} of 3-dimensional diffeomorphisms f with hyperbolic fixed points p the stable and unstable manifolds of which have quadratic tangencies and satisfying some open conditions and such that Df(p) has non-real expanding eigenvalues and a real contracting eigenvalue. The aim of this paper is to study moduli of diffeomorphisms in \mathcal{U}. We show that, for a generic element f of \mathcal{U}, all the eigenvalues of Df(p) are moduli and the restriction of a conjugacy homeomorphism to a local unstable manifold is a uniquely determined linear conformal map.
