Let f be a map with bounded set of singular values for which periodic dynamic rays exist and land. We prove that each non-repelling cycle is associated to a singular orbit which cannot accumulate on any other non-repelling cycle. When f has finitely many singular values this implies a refinement of the Fatou-Shishikura inequality. Our approach is combinatorial in the spirit of the approach used by [Ki00], [BCL+16] for polynomials.
