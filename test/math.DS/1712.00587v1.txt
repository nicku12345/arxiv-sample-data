The well-known theorem of Johnson, Palmer and Sell asserts that the endpoints of the Sacker--Sell spectrum of a given cocycle of invertible matrices over a topological dynamical system (M, f) are realized as Lyapunov exponents with respect to some ergodic invariant probability measure for f. In this note we establish the version of this result for quasicompact cocycles of operators acting on an arbitrary Banach space.
