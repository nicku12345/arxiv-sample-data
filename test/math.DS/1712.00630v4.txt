We define a natural topology on the collection of (equivalence classes up to scaling of) locally finite measures on a homogeneous space and prove that in this topology, pushforwards of certain infinite volume orbits equidistribute in the ambient space. As an application of our results we prove an asymptotic formula for the number of integral points in a ball on some varieties as the radius goes to infinity.
