In the inverse limit {\hat{I}}_s of a tent map f_s restricted to its core, the set \mathcal{GR} of points whose path components are bi-infinite and bi-dense has full measure with respect to the measure induced on \hat{I}_s by the unique absolutely continuous invariant measure of f_s. With respect to topology, there is a dichotomy. When the parameter s is such that the critical orbit of f_s is not dense, \mathcal{GR} contains a dense G_\delta set. In contrast, when the critical orbit of f_s is dense, the complement of \mathcal{GR} contains a dense G_\delta set.
