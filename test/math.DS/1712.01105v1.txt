In the following text we prove that for finite discrete X with at least two elements and infinite \Gamma, the generalized shift transformation semigroup ({\mathcal S},X^\Gamma) is equicontinuous (resp. has at least an equicontinuous point, is not sensitive) if and only if for all w\in\Gamma, \{\varphi(w):\sigma_\varphi\in{\mathcal S}\} is finite. We continue our study regarding distality and expansivity of ({\mathcal S},X^\Gamma).
