We prove that for some potentials (including the Newtonian one, and the potential of Helmholtz vortices in the plane) relative equilibria consisting of two homothetic regular polygons of arbitrary size can only occur if the masses at each polygon are equal. The same result is true for many regular polygons as long as the ratio between the radii of the polygons are sufficient large. Moreover, under these hypotheses, the relative equilibrium always exist.
