We study the circle homeomorphisms extensions over a strictly ergodic homeomorphism. Under a very mild restriction, we show that the fibered rotation number is locally constant on an open and dense subset. In the complement of this set, we found a dense subset in which every map is conjugate to a direct product. Our result provides a generalisation of Avila-Bochi-Damanik's result on {\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{R})-cocycles, and Jager-Wang-Zhou's result on quasi-periodically forced maps, to a broader setting.
