We extend some results of Marmi--Moussa--Yoccoz on the cohomological equations and local conjugacy classes of interval exchange maps of restricted Roth type.   In particular, we answer a question of Krikorian about the codimension of the local conjugacy class of self-similar interval exchange maps associated to the Eierlegende Wollmilchsau and the Ornithorynque.
