We prove that heterodimensional cycles can be created by unfolding a pair of homoclinic tangencies in a certain class of C-infinity diffeomorphisms. This implies the existence of a C2- open domain in the space of dynamical systems with a certain type of symmetry where systems with heterodimensional cycles are dense in C-infinity. In particular, we describe a class of three-dimensional flows with a Lorenz-like attractor such that an arbitrarily small perturbation of any such flow can belong to this domain - in this case the corresponding heterodimensional cycles belong to a chain-transitive attractor of the perturbed flow.
