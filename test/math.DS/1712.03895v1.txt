The set \mathbf{F}(d) of foliations of degree d on the complex projective plane can be identified with a Zariski's open set of a projective space of dimension (d+2)^2-2 on which acts \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}). The subset \mathbf{FP}(d) of \mathbf{F}(d) consisting of foliations of \mathbf{F}(d) with a flat Legendre transform (dual web) is a Zariski closed subset of \mathbf{F}(d). In this dissertation we study foliations of \mathbf{FP}(d) and we try to better understand the topological structure of \mathbf{FP}(3). First, we establish some effective criteria for the flatness of the dual d-web of a homogeneous foliation of degree d and we describe some explicit examples. We will see also that it is possible, under certain assumptions, to bring the study of flatness of the dual web of a general foliation to the homogeneous framework. Second, we classify up to automorphism of \mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}} the elements of \mathbf{FP}(3). More precisely, we show that up to automorphism there are 16 foliations of degree 3 with a flat Legendre transform. From this classification we deduce that \mathbf{FP}(3) has exactly 12 irreducible components.
