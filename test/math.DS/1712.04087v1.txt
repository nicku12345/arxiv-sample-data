We present pathwise flocking dynamics and local sensitivity analysis for the Cucker-Smale(C-S) model with random communications and initial data. For the deterministic communications, it is well known that the C-S model can model emergent local and global flocking dynamics depending on initial data and integrability of communication function. However, the communication mechanism between agents are not a priori clear and needs to be figured out from observed phenomena and data. Thus, uncertainty in communication is an intrinsic component in the flocking modeling of the C-S model. In this paper, we provide a class of admissible random uncertainties which allows us to perform the local sensitivity analysis for flocking and establish stability to the random C-S model with uncertain communication.
