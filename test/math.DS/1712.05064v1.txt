Some viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, can infect several types of cell populations. The age of infection can also affect the dynamics of infected cells and production of viral particles. In this work, we study a virus model with infection-age and different types of target cells which takes into account the saturation effect in antibody immune response and a general non-linear infection rate. We construct suitable Lyapunov functionals to show that the global dynamics of the model is completely determined by two critical values: the basic reproduction number of virus and the reproductive number of antibody response.
