Let a countable amenable group G act on a \zd\ compact metric space X. For two clopen subsets \mathsf A and \mathsf B of X we say that \mathsf A is \emph{subequivalent} to \mathsf B (we write \mathsf A\preccurlyeq \mathsf B), if there exists a finite partition \mathsf A=\bigcup_{i=1}^k \mathsf A_i of \mathsf A into clopen sets and there are elements g_1,g_2,\dots,g_k in G such that g_1(\mathsf A_1), g_2(\mathsf A_2),\dots, g_k(\mathsf A_k) are disjoint subsets of \mathsf B. We say that the action \emph{admits comparison} if for any clopen sets \mathsf A, \mathsf B, the condition, that for every G-invariant probability measure \mu on X we have the sharp inequality \mu(\mathsf A)<\mu(\mathsf B), implies \mathsf A\preccurlyeq \mathsf B. Comparison has many desired consequences for the action, such as the existence of tilings with arbitrarily good F{\o}lner properties, which are factors of the action. Also, the theory of symbolic extensions, known for \mathbb z-actions, extends to actions which admit comparison. We also study a purely group-theoretic notion of comparison: if every action of G on any zero-dimensional compact metric space admits comparison then we say that G has the \emph{comparison property}. Classical groups \mathbb z and \mathbb z^d enjoy the comparison property, but in the general case the problem remains open. In this paper we prove this property for groups whose every finitely generated subgroup has subexponential growth.
