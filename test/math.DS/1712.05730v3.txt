The Lorenz-96 model is widely used as a test model for various applications, such as data assimilation methods. This symmetric model has the forcing F\in\mathbb{R} and the dimension n\in\mathbb{N} as parameters and is \mathbb{Z}_n equivariant. In this paper, we unravel its dynamics for F<0 using equivariant bifurcation theory. Symmetry gives rise to invariant subspaces, that play an important role in this model. We exploit them in order to generalise results from a low dimension to all multiples of that dimension. We discuss symmetry for periodic orbits as well.   Our analysis leads to proofs of the existence of pitchfork bifurcations for F<0 in specific dimensions n: In all even dimensions, the equilibrium (F,\ldots,F) exhibits a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. In dimensions n=4k, k\in\mathbb{N}, a second supercritical pitchfork bifurcation occurs simultaneously for both equilibria originating from the previous one.   Furthermore, numerical observations reveal that in dimension n=2^qp, where q\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\} and p is odd, there is a finite cascade of exactly q subsequent pitchfork bifurcations, whose bifurcation values are independent of n. This structure is discussed and interpreted in light of the symmetries of the model.
