We consider the structure of substantially dissipative complex H\'enon maps admitting a dominated splitting on the Julia set. The dominated splitting assumption corresponds to the one-dimensional assumption that there are no critical points on the Julia set. Indeed, we prove the corresponding description of the Fatou set, namely that it consists of only finitely many components, each either attracting or parabolic periodic. In particular there are no rotation domains, and no wandering components. Moreover, we show that J = J^\star and the dynamics on J is hyperbolic away from parabolic cycles.
