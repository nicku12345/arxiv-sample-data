Explicit symmetry breaking occurs when a dynamical system having a certain symmetry group is perturbed in a way that the perturbation preserves only some symmetries of the original system. We give a geometric approach to study this phenomenon in the setting of equivariant Hamiltonian systems. A lower bound for the number of orbits of equilibria and orbits of relative equilibria which persist after a small perturbation is given. This bound is given in terms of the equivariant Lyusternik-Schnirelmann category of the group orbit.
