This paper discusses the thermodynamic properties for certain time-dependent dynamical systems. In particular, we are interested in time-dependent dynamical systems with the specification property. We show that each time-dependent dynamical system given by a sequence of surjective continuous self maps of a compact metric space with the specification property has positive topological entropy and all points are entropy point. In particular, it is proved that these systems are topologically chaotic. We will treat the dynamics of uniformly Ruelle-expanding time-dependent dynamical systems on compact metric spaces and provide some sufficient conditions that these systems have the specification property. Consequently, we conclude that these systems have positive topological entropy. This extends a result of Kawan \cite{K2}, corresponding to the case when the expanding maps are smooth, to the more general case of expanding maps. Additionally, we study the topological pressure of time-dependent dynamical systems. We obtain conditions under which the topological entropy and topological pressure of any continuous potential can be computed as a limit at a definite size scale. Finally, we study the Lipschitz regularity of the topological pressure function for expansive (uniformly Ruelle-expanding) time-dependent dynamical systems on compact metric spaces.
