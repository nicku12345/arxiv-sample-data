We show that the stable and unstable sets of non-uniformly hyperbolic horseshoes arising in some heteroclinic bifurcations of surface diffeomorphisms have the value conjectured in a previous work by the second and third authors of the present paper. Our results apply to first heteroclinic bifurcations associated to horseshoes with Hausdorff dimension <22/21 of conservative surface diffeomorphisms.
