We consider a switched system of two subsystems that are activated as the trajectory enters the regions \{(x,y):x>\bar x\} and \{(x,y):x<-\bar x\} respectively, where \bar x is a positive parameter. We prove that a regular asymptotically stable equilibrium of the associated Filippov equation of sliding motion (corresponding to \bar x=0) yields an orbitally stable limit cycle for all \bar x>0 sufficiently small. The research is motivated by an application to a dc-dc power converter, where \bar x>0 is used in place of \bar x=0 to avoid sliding motions.
