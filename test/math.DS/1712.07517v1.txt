For switched systems that switch between distinct globally stable equilibria, we offer closed-form formulas that lock oscillations in the required neighborhood of the equilibria. Motivated by non-spiking neuron models, the main focus of the paper is on the case of planar switched affine systems, where we use properties of nested cylinders coming from quadratic Lyapunov functions. In particular, for the first time ever, we use the dwell-time concept in order to give an explicit condition for non-spiking of linear neuron models with periodically switching current. An extension to the general nonlinear case is also given.
