It is well-known that random attractors of a random dynamical system are generally not unique. We show that for general pullback attractors and weak attractors, there is always a minimal (in the sense of smallest) random attractor which attracts a given family of (possibly random) sets. We provide an example which shows that this property need not hold for forward attractors. We point out that our concept of a random attractor is very general: The family of sets which are attracted is allowed to be completely arbitrary.
