In this paper, we prove the generic version of Cantor spectrum for quasi-periodic Schr\"{o}dinger operators with finitely smooth and small potentials, and we also show pure point spectrum for a class of multi-frequency C^k long-range operators on \ell^2(\Z^d). These results are based on reducibility properties of finitely differentiable quasi-periodic SL(2,\R) cocycles. More precisely, we prove that if the base frequency is Diophantine, then a C^k SL(2,\R)-valued cocycle is reducible if it is close to a constant cocycle, sufficiently smooth and the rotation number of it is Diophantine or rational with respect to the frequency.
