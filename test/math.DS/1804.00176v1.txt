In this paper we prove the following: Take any "small Mandelbrot set" and zoom in a neighborhood of a parabolic or Misiurewicz parameter in it, then we can see a quasiconformal image of a Cantor Julia set which is a perturbation of a parabolic or Misiurewicz Julia set. Furthermore, zoom in its middle part, then we can see a certain nested structure ("decoration") and finally another "smaller Mandelbrot set" appears. A similar nested structure exists in the Julia set for any parameter in the "smaller Mandelbrot set". We can also find images of a Julia sets by quasiconformal maps with dilatation arbitrarily close to 1. All the parameters belonging to these images are semihyperbolic and this leads to the fact that the set of semihyperbolic but non-Misiurewicz parameters are dense with Hausdorff dimension 2 in the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.
