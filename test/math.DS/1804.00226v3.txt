Given a maximal \mathbb{Q}-torus in SL(N,\mathbb{Q}), its orbit from identity coset in SL(N,\mathbb{R})/SL(N,\mathbb{Z}) naturally carries a possibly infinite Haar measure. We classify all possible limit measures of it when translated by a sequence of elements from SL(N,\mathbb{R}). This is a natural extension of Shapira and Zheng's work where only \mathbb{Q}-split tori are considered.
