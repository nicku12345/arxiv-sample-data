In the space of orientation-preserving circle maps that are not necessarily surjective nor injective, the rotation number does not vary continuously. Each map where one of these discontinuities occurs is itself discontinuous and we can consider the possible values of the rotation number when we modify this map only at its discontinuities. These values are always rational numbers that necessarily obey a certain arithmetic relation. In this paper we show that in several examples this relation totally characterizes the possible values of the rotation number on its discontinuities, but we also prove that in certain circumstances this relation is not sufficient for this characterization.
