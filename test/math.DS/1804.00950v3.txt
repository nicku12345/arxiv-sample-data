In this paper, we establish a KAM-theorem for ordinary differential equations with finitely differentiable vector fields and multiple degeneracies. The theorem can be used to deal with the persistence of quasi-periodic invariant tori in multiple Hopf and zero-multiple Hopf bifurcations, as well as their subordinate bifurcations, of equilibrium points of continuous dynamical systems.
