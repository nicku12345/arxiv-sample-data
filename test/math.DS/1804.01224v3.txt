Quantization for probability distributions refers broadly to estimating a given probability measure by a discrete probability measure supported by a finite number of points. We consider general geometric approaches to quantization using stationary processes arising in dynamical systems, followed by a discussion of the special cases of stationary processes: random processes and Diophantine processes. We are interested in how close stationary process can be to giving optimal n-means and n^{th} optimal mean distortion errors. We also consider different ways of measuring the degree of approximation by quantization, and their advantages and disadvantages in these different contexts.
