Let X be a Peano continuum having a free arc and let C^0(X) be the semigroup of continuous self-maps of X. A subsemigroup F\subset C^0(X) is said to be sensitive, if there is some constant c>0 such that for any nonempty open set U\subset X, there is some f\in F such that the diameter {\rm diam}(f(U))>c. We show that if X admits a sensitive commutative subsemigroup F of C^0(X) consisting of continuous open maps, then either X is an arc, or X is a circle.
