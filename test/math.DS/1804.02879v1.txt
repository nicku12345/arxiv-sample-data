In a recent paper [Adv. Math. 305:165--196, 2017], Komornik et al.~proved a long-conjectured formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the set \mathcal{U}_q of numbers having a unique expansion in the (non-integer) base q, and showed that this Hausdorff dimension is continuous in q. Unfortunately, their proof contained a gap which appears difficult to fix. This article gives a completely different proof of these results, using a more direct combinatorial approach.
