In this work at first the relation the Mittag-Lefler function to the exponential is given. The results are applied to the construction of the solution of Cauchy problem for ordinary linear operator differential equations with constant coefficients and fractional derivatives. On the example is shown that when the order of the derivatives (fractional) approaches to integers the results coincide with the classical.
