An oscillator is called isochronous if all motions have a common period. When the system is forced by a time-dependent perturbation with the same period the dynamics may change and the phenomenon of resonance can appear. In this context, resonance means that all solutions are unbounded. The theory of resonance is well known for the harmonic oscillator and we extend it to nonlinear isochronous oscillators.
