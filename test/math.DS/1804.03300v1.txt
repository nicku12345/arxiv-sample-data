Bending vibrations of thin beams and plates may be described by nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam equations with x-dependent coefficients. In this paper we investigate existence of families of time-periodic solutions to such a model using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and a differentiable Nash-Moser iteration scheme. The results hold for all parameters (\epsilon,\omega) in a Cantor set with asymptotically full measure as \epsilon\rightarrow0.
