We prove the abundance of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures for diffeomorphisms away from ones with a homoclinic tangency. This is motivated by conjectures of Palis on the existence of physical (Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measures for global dynamics. The main novelty in this paper is that we have to deeply study Gibbs cu-states in different levels. Note that we have to use random perturbations to give some upper bound of the level of Gibbs cu-states.
