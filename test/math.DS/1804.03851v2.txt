For numerical sequences taking values 0 or complex numbers of modulus 1, we define Chowla property and Sarnak property. We prove that Chowla property implies Sarnak property. We also prove that for Lebesgue almost every \beta>1, the sequence (e^{2\pi \beta^n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}} shares Chowla property and consequently is orthogonal to all topological dynamical systems of zero entropy. It is also discussed whether the samples of a given random sequence have Chowla property almost surely. Some dependent random sequences having almost surely Chowla property are constructed.
