Formulations of open physical systems within the framework of Non-Equilibrium Reversible/Irreversible Coupling (associated with the acronym "GENERIC") is related in this work with state-space realizations that are given as boundary port-Hamiltonian systems. This reformulation is carried out explicitly by splitting the dynamics of the system into a reversible contribution given by a Poisson bracket and an irreversible contribution given by a symmetric dissipation bracket, and is facilitated by the introduction of an exergy-like potential.
