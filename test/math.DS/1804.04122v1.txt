Infinitesimal contraction analysis, wherein global asymptotic convergence results are obtained from local dynamical properties, has proven to be a powerful tool for applications in biological, mechanical, and transportation systems. Thus far, the technique has been restricted to systems governed by a single smooth differential or difference equation. We generalize infinitesimal contraction analysis to hybrid systems governed by interacting differential and difference equations. Our theoretical results are illustrated on a series of examples.
