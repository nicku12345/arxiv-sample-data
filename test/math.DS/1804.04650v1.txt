We give a new and elementary proof that the number of elastic collisions of a finite number of balls in the Euclidean space is finite. We show that if there are n balls of equal masses and radii 1, and at the time of a collision between any two balls the distance between any other pair of balls is greater than n^{-n}, then the total number of collisions is bounded by n^{(5/2+\varepsilon)n}, for any fixed \varepsilon>0 and large n. We also show that if there is a number of collisions larger than n^{cn} for an appropriate c>0, then a large number of these collisions occur within a subfamily of balls that form a very tight configuration.
