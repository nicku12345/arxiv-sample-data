In this paper we analyze nonlinear dynamics of the fullerene molecule. We prove the existence of global branches of periodic solutions emerging from an icosahedral equilibrium (nonlinear normal modes). We also determine the symmetric properties of the branches of nonlinear normal modes for maximal orbit types. We find several solutions which are standing and rotating waves that propagate along the molecule with icosahedral, tetrahedral, pentagonal and triangular symmetries. We complement our theoretical results with numerical computations using Newton's method.
