We give the first example of a smooth family of real and complex maps having sensitive dependence of geometric Gibbs states at positive temperature. This family consists of quadratic-like maps that are non-uniformly hyperbolic in a strong sense. We show that for a dense set of maps in the family the geometric Gibbs states do not converge at positive temperature. These are the first examples of non-convergence at positive temperature in statistical mechanics or the thermodynamic formalism, and answers a question of van Enter and Ruszel. We also show that this phenomenon is robust: There is an open set of analytic 2-parameter families of quadratic-like maps that exhibit sensitive dependence of geometric Gibbs states at positive temperature.
