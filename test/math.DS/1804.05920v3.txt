We study expansivity and the shadowing property for finitely generated group actions on metric spaces. We consider the projecting and lifting problems for actions having these properties. We prove that every expansive action with the shadowing property is strongly GH-stable (Gromov-Hausdorff stable). Finally, we introduce sequential shadowing property for finitely generated group actions on metric spaces and show that such shadowing is strong enough to imply the spectral decomposition property.
