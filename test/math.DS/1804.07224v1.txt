We study a topological structure of a closed n-manifold M^n (n\geq 3) which admits a Morse-Smale diffeomorphism such that codimension one separatrices of saddles periodic points have no heteroclinic intersections different from heteroclinic points. Also we consider gradient like flow on M^n such that codimension one separatices of saddle singularities have no intersection at all. We show that M^n is either an n-sphere S^n, or the connected sum of a finite number of copies of S^{n-1}\otimes S^1 and a finite number of special manifolds N^n_i admitting polar Morse-Smale systems. Moreover, if some N^n_i contains a single saddle, then N^n_i is projective-like (in particular, n\in\{4,8,16\}, and N^n_i is a simply-connected and orientable manifold). Given input dynamical data, one constructs a supporting manifold M^n. We give a formula relating the number of sinks, sources and saddle periodic points to the connected sum for M^n. As a consequence, we obtain conditions for the existence of heteroclinic intersections for Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms and a periodic trajectory for Morse-Smale flows.
