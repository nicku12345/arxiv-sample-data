Let \beta>1 be a real number. In this paper, the Hausdorff dimension of sets consisting of pairs of numbers with prescribed quantitative waiting time indicators in \beta-expansions are determined. More precisely, let I be the unit interval [0,1) and write \underline{R}^\beta(x,y) and \overline{R}^\beta(x,y) as the lower and upper quantitative waiting time indicators of y by x in \beta-expansions, respectively. Define the waiting set on the plane by \[E_\beta(a,b)=\left\{(x,y)\in I^2\colon\underline{R}^\beta(x,y)=a,\overline{R}^\beta(x,y)=b\right\}.\] where 0\leq a\leq b\leq\infty, then the set E_\beta(a,b) is always of Hausdorff dimension two for any pair of numbers a and b. In addition, some generalizations for this result are also given in the last section.
