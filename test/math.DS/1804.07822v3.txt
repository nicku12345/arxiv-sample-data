We provide a topological classification of locally constant functions over subshifts of finite type via their zero-temperature measures. Our approach is to analyze the relationship between the distribution of the zero-temperature measures and the boundary of higher dimensional generalized rotation sets. We also discuss the regularity of the localized entropy function on the boundary of the generalized rotation sets.
