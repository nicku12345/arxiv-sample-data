This paper presents versions of integral input-to-state stability and integral input-to-integral-state stability for nonlinear sampled-data systems, under the low measurement rate constraint. In particular, we compensate the lack of measurements using an estimator approximately reconstructing the current state. Interestingly, under certain checkable conditions, we establish that a controller that semiglobally practically integral input-to-(integral-) state stabilizes an approximate discrete-time model of a single-rate nonlinear sampled-data system, also stabilizes the exact discrete-time model of the nonlinear sampled-data system in the same sense implemented in a dual-rate setting. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.
