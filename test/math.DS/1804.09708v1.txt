We investigate a wide class of two-dimensional hyperbolic systems with singularities, and prove the almost sure invariance principle (ASIP) for the random process generated by sequences of dynamically H\"older observables. The observables could be unbounded, and the process may be non-stationary and need not have linearly growing variances. Our results apply to Anosov diffeomorphisms, Sinai dispersing billiards and their perturbations. The random processes under consideration are related to the fluctuation of Lyapunov exponents, the shrinking target problem, etc.
