We show that a smooth sufficiently small perturbation of a \mathbb Z^m action on the torus by simultaneously Diophantine translations, is smoothly conjugate to the unperturbed action under a natural condition on the rotation sets. This generalizes recent result of Karaliolios [4] of the action generators to higher rank abelian actions, and the result of Moser [8] to higher dimensional tori.
