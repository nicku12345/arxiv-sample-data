The wave equation on network is defined by \partial_{tt}u=\Delta_{G}u+g(u), where u\in\mathbb{R}^{n} and the graph Laplacian \Delta_{G} is an operator on functions on n vertices. We suppose that g:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n} is an odd continuous function that satisfies g(0)=g^{\prime }(0)=0 and the Nagumo condition. Assuming that the graph is invariant by a subgroup of permutations \Gamma, using a \Gamma-equivariant topological invariant we prove the existence of multiple non-constant p-periodic solutions characterized by their symmetries.
