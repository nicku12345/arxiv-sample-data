For a non-trivial transcendental semigroup, escaping set I(S) is in general S-forward invariant and it is S-completely invariant if semigroup S is abelian. In the contrary of this result, we investigate completely invariant escaping set K(S) in different way even if semigroup S is not abelian and we discuss some properties and structure of such type of escaping set. Also, we establish some relations between completely invariant escaping set K(S) and the general escaping set I(S).
