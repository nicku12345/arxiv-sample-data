Let X be a topological space and \mu be a nonatomic finite measure on a \sigma-algebra \Sigma containing the Borel \sigma-algebra of X. We say \mu is weakly outer regular, if for every A \in \Sigma and \epsilon>0, there exists an open set O such that \mu(A \backslash O)=0 and \mu(O \backslash A)<\epsilon. The main result of this paper is to show that if f,g \in L^1(X,\Sigma, \mu) with \int_X f d\mu=\int_X g d\mu=1, then there exists an increasing family of open sets u(t), t\in [0,1], such that u(0)=\emptyset, u(1)=X, and \int_{u(t)} f d\mu=\int_{u(t)} g d\mu=t for all t\in [0,1]. We also study a similar problem for a finite collection of integrable functions on general finite and \sigma-finite nonatomic measure spaces.
