We consider a general concept of Daugavet property with respect to a norming subspace. This concept covers both the usual Daugavet property and its weak^* analogue. We introduce and study analogues for narrow operators and rich subspaces in this general setting and apply the results to show that a quotient of L_1[0,1] over an \ell_1-subspace can fail the Daugavet property. The latter answers a question posed to us by A. Pelczynski in the negative.
