We introduce bi-parametric fractional integrals of the Erdelyi-Kober type that generalize known Garding-Gindikin constructions associated to the cone of positive definite matrices. It is proved that the Radon transform, which maps a zonal function on the Grassmann manifold G_{n,m} of m-dimensional linear subspaces of R^n into a function on the similar manifold G_{n,k},  1\leq m<k \leq n-1, is represented as analytic continuation of the corresponding Erdelyi-Kober integral. This result shows that different Grinberg-Rubin's formulas for such transforms [GR] have, in fact, a common structure.
