We consider the stable approximation of sparse solutions to non-linear operator equations by means of Tikhonov regularization with a subquadratic penalty term. Imposing certain assumptions, which for a linear operator are equivalent to the standard range condition, we derive the usual convergence rate O(\sqrt{\delta}) of the regularized solutions in dependence of the noise level \delta. Particular emphasis lies on the case, where the true solution is known to have a sparse representation in a given basis. In this case, if the differential of the operator satisfies a certain injectivity condition, we can show that the actual convergence rate improves up to O(\delta).
