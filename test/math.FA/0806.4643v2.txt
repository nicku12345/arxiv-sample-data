For a locally compact group G, let A(G) be its Fourier algebra, let M_{cb}A(G) denote the completely bounded multipliers of A(G), and let A_{Mcb}(G) stand for the closure of A(G) in M_{cb}A(G). We characterize the norm one idempotents in M_{cb}A(G): the indicator function of a set E \subset G is a norm one idempotent in M_{cb}A(G) if and only if E is a coset of an open subgroup of G. As applications, we describe the closed ideals of A_{Mcb}(G) with an approximate identity bounded by 1, and we characterize those G for which A_{Mcb}(G) is 1-amenable in the sense of B. E. Johnson. (We can even slightly relax the norm bounds.)
