Shearlets on the cone provide Parseval frames for L^2. They also provide near-optimal approximation for the class \mathcal{E} of cartoon-like images. Moreover, there are spaces associated to them other than L^2 and there exist embeddings between these and classical spaces.   We prove approximation properties of the cone-adapted shearlets in a more general context, namely, when the target function belongs to a class or space different to \mathcal{E} and when the error is not necessarily measured in the L^2-norm but in a much wider family of smoothness space of high anisotropy.
