There are two main aims of the paper. The first one is to extend the criterion for the precompactness of sets in Banach function spaces to the setting of quasi-Banach function spaces. The second one is to extend the criterion for the precompactness of sets in the Lebesgue spaces L_p(\mathbb R^n), 1 \leq p < \infty, to the so-called power quasi-Banach function spaces. These criteria are applied to establish compact embeddings of abstract Besov spaces into quasi-Banach function spaces. The results are illustrated on embeddings of Besov spaces B^s_{p,q}(\mathbb R^n), 0<s<1, 0<p,q\leq \infty, into Lorentz-type spaces.
