The main purpose of this study is to introduce the spaces cs^{\lambda}, cs_0^{\lambda} and bs^{\lambda} which are BK-spaces of non-absolute type. We prove that these spaces are linearly isomorphic to the spaces cs, cs_0 and bs, respectively and derive some inclusion relations. Additionally, their Schauder bases have been constructed and the \alpha-,\beta- and \gamma- duals of these spaces have been computed. Finally, we characterize some matrix classes from the spaces cs^{\lambda}, cs_0^{\lambda} and bs^{\lambda} to spaces \ell_p, c and c_0, where 1\leq p\leq\infty .
