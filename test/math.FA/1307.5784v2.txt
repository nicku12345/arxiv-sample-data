We obtain exhaustive results and treat in a unified way the question of boundedness, compactness, and weak compactness of composition operators from the Bloch space into any space from a large family of conformally invariant spaces that includes the classical spaces like BMOA, Q_\alpha, and analytic Besov spaces B^p. In particular, by combining techniques from both complex and functional analysis, we prove that in this setting weak compactness is equivalent to compactness. For the operators into the corresponding "small" spaces we also characterize the boundedness and show that it is equivalent to compactness.
