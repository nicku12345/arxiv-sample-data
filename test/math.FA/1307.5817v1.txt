This paper presents new sequence spaces X(r, s, t, p ; B) for X \in \{l_\infty(p), c(p), c_0(p), l(p)\} defined by using generalized means and difference operator. It is shown that these spaces are complete paranormed spaces and the spaces X(r, s, t, p ; B) for X \in \{c(p), c_0(p), l(p)\} have Schauder basis. Furthermore, the \alpha-, \beta-, \gamma- duals of these sequence spaces are computed and also obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for some matrix transformations from X(r, s, t, p ;B) to X. Finally, some classes of compact operators on the space l_p(r, s, t ;B) are characterized by using the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness.
