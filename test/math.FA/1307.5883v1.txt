In this paper, new sequence spaces X(r, s, t ;\Delta^{(m)}) for X\in \{l_\infty, c, c_0\} defined by using generalized means and difference operator of order m are introduced. It is shown that these spaces are complete normed linear spaces and the spaces c_0(r, s, t ;\Delta^{(m)}), c(r, s, t ;\Delta^{(m)}) have Schauder basis. Furthermore, the \alpha-, \beta-, \gamma- duals of these spaces are computed and also obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for some matrix transformations from X(r, s, t ;\Delta^{(m)}) to X. Finally, some classes of compact operators on the spaces c_0(r, s, t ;\Delta^{(m)}) and l_{\infty}(r, s, t ;\Delta^{(m)}) are characterized by using the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness.
