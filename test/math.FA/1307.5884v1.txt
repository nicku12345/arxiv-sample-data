This paper presents new sequence spaces X(r, s, t, p ;\Delta) for X \in \{l_\infty(p), c(p), c_0(p), l(p)\} defined by using generalized means and difference operator. It is shown that these spaces are complete under a suitable paranorm. Furthermore, the \alpha-, \beta-, \gamma- duals of these sequence spaces are computed and also obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for some matrix transformations from X(r, s, t, p ;\Delta) to X. Finally, it is proved that the sequence space l(r, s, t, p ;\Delta) is rotund when p_n>1 for all n and has the Kadec-Klee property.
