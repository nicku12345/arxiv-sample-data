The notion of framings, recently emerging in P. G. Casazza, D. Han, and D. R. Larson, Frames for Banach spaces, in {\em The functional and harmonic analysis of wavelets and frames} (San Antonio, TX, 1999), {\em Contemp. Math}. {\bf 247} (1999), 149-182 as generalization of the reconstraction formula generated by pairs of dual frames, is in this note extended substantially. This calls on refining the basic dilation results which still being in the flavor of {\em th\'eor\`eme principal} of B. Sz-Nagy go much beyond it.
