This paper deals with new sequence spaces X(r, s, t ;\Delta)  for X\in \{l_\infty, c, c_0\} defined by using generalized means and difference operator. It is shown that these spaces are complete normed linear spaces and the spaces X(r, s, t ;\Delta) for X\in \{c, c_0\} have Schauder basis. Furthermore, the \alpha-, \beta-, \gamma- duals of these sequence spaces are computed and also established necessary and sufficient conditions for matrix transformations from X(r, s, t ;\Delta) to X.
