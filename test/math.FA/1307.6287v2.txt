If D:A \to X is a derivation from a Banach algebra to a contractive, Banach A-bimodule, then one can equip X^{**} with an A^{**}-bimodule structure, such that the second transpose D^{**}: A^{**} \to X^{**} is again a derivation. We prove an analogous extension result, where A^{**} is replaced by \F(A), the \emph{enveloping dual Banach algebra} of A, and X^{**} by an appropriate kind of universal, enveloping, normal dual bimodule of X. Using this, we obtain some new characterizations of Connes-amenability of \F(A). In particular we show that \F(A) is Connes-amenable if and only if A admits a so-called WAP-virtual diagonal. We show that when A=L^1(G), existence of a WAP-virtual diagonal is equivalent to the existence of a virtual diagonal in the usual sense. Our approach does not involve invariant means for G.
