We study general (not necessarily Hamiltonian) first-order symmetric systems J y'-B(t)y=\D(t) f(t) on an interval \cI=[a,b\rangle  with the regular endpoint a. It is assumed that the deficiency indices n_\pm(\Tmi) of the minimal relation \Tmi satisfy n_+(\Tmi)< n_-(\Tmi). We define   \l-depending boundary conditions which are analogs of separated self-adjoint boundary conditions for Hamiltonian systems. With a boundary value problem involving such conditions we associate an exit space self-adjoint extension \wt T of \Tmi and the m-function m(\cd), which is an analog of the Titchmarsh-Weyl coefficient for the Hamiltonian system. By using m-function we obtain the eigenfunction expansion with the spectral function \Si(\cd) of the minimally possible dimension and characterize the case when spectrum of \wt T is defined by \Si(\cd). Moreover, we parametrize all spectral functions in terms of a Nevanlinna type boundary parameter. Application of these results to ordinary differential operators of an odd order enables us to complete the results by Everitt and Krishna Kumar on the Titchmarsh-Weyl theory of such operators.
