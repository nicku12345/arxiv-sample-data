Let v be a submultiplicative weight. Then we prove that v satisfies GRS-condition, if and only if v\cdot e^{-\ep |\cdo |} is bounded for every positive \ep. We use this equivalence to establish identification properties between weighted Lebesgue spaces, and between certain modulation spaces and Gelfand-Shilov spaces.
