In this paper, we answer a question posed in the introduction of \cite{sub hyp} positively, i.e, we show that if T is \mathcal M-hypercyclic operator with \mathcal M-hypercyclic vector x in a Hilbert space \mathcal H, then P(Orb(T,x)) is dense in the subspace \mathcal M where P is the orthogonal projection onto \mathcal M. Furthermore, we give some relations between {\mathcal M}^{\perp}-hypercyclicity and the orthogonal projection onto {\mathcal M}^{\perp}. We also give sufficient conditions for a bilateral weighted shift operators on a Hilbert space \ell^{2}(\mathbb Z) to be subspace-hypercyclic, cosequently, there exists an operator T such that both T and T^* are subspace-hypercyclic operators. Finally, we give an \mathcal M-hypercyclic criterion for an operator T in terms of its eigenvalues.
