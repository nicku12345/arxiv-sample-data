In this paper, we establish some results about the singular points of certain non-monotone potential operators. Here is a sample: If X is an infinite-dimensional reflexive real Banach space and if T:X\to X^* is a non-monotone, closed, continuous potential operator such that the functional x\to \int_0^1T(sx)(x)ds is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous and \lim_{\|x\|\to +\infty}(\int_0^1T(sx)(x)ds+\varphi(x))=+\infty for all \varphi\in X^*, then the set of all singular points of T is not \sigma-compact.
