We present effective algorithms for uniform approximation of multivariate functions satisfying some prescribed inner structure. We extend in several directions the analysis of recovery of ridge functions f(x)=g(\langle a,x\rangle) as performed earlier by one of the authors and his coauthors. We consider ridge functions defined on the unit cube [-1,1]^d as well as recovery of ridge functions defined on the unit ball from noisy measurements. We conclude with the study of functions of the type f(x)=g(\|a-x\|_{l_2^d}^2).
