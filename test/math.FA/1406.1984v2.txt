This paper studies the Hardy-type inequalities on the discrete intervals. The first result is the variational formulas of the optimal constants. Using these formulas, one may obtain an approximating procedure and the known basic estimates of the optimal constants. The second result, which is the main innovation of this paper, is about the factor of basic upper estimates. An improved factor is presented, which is smaller than the known one and is best possible. Some comparison results are included for comparing the optimal constants on different intervals.
