We give some necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility to represent a Hermitian operator on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space (real or complex) in the form \sum_{i=1}^nQ_iP_i, where P_1,\dots,P_n, Q_1,\dots,Q_n are orthogonal projections. We show that the smallest number n=n(c) admitting the representation x=\sum_{i=1}^{n(c)}Q_iP_i for every x=x^* with \|x\|\leq c satisfies 8c+\frac83\leq n(c)\leq 8c+10. This is a partial answer to the question asked by L. W. Marcoux in 2010.
