We establish continuity and Schatten-von Neumann properties for matrix operators with matrices satisfying mixed quasi-norm estimates. These considerations also include the case when the Lebesgue and Schatten parameters are allowed to stay between 0 and 1. We use the results to deduce continuity and Schatten-von Neumann properties for pseudo-differential operators with symbols in a broad class of modulation spaces.
