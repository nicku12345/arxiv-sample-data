This is the third of a series of papers surveying some small part of the remarkable work of our friend and colleague Nigel Kalton. We have written it as part of a tribute to his memory. It does not contain new results. This time, rather than concentrating on one particular paper, we attempt to give a general overview of Nigel's many contributions to the theory of interpolation of Banach spaces, and also, significantly, quasi-Banach spaces.
