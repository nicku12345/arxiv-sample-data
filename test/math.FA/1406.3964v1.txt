We explore the possibilities of reaching the characterization of eigenfunction of Laplacian as a degenerate case of the inverse Paley-Wiener theorem (characterizing functions whose Fourier transform is supported on a compact annulus) for the Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type. Most distinguished prototypes of these spaces are the hyperbolic spaces. The statement and the proof of the main result work mutatis-mutandis for a number of spaces including Euclidean spaces and Damek-Ricci spaces.
