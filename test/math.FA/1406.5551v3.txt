We consider the space of molecules endowed with the transpose version of the Chevet-Saphar norm and we identify its dual space with the space of Lipschitz strongly p-summing operators. We also extend some old results to the category of Lipschitz mappings and we give a factorization result of Lipschitz (p,r,s)-summing operators.
