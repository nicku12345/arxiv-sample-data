We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a weight pair (v,w) governing the boundedness of the Riesz potential operator I_{\alpha} defined on a homogeneous group G from L^p_{dec,r}(w, G) to L^q(v, G), where L^p_{dec,r}(w, G) is the Lebesgue space defined for non-negative radially decreasing functions on G. The same problem is also studied for the potential operator with product kernels I_{\alpha_1, \alpha_2} defined on a product of two homogeneous groups G_1\times G_2. In the latter case weights, in general, are not of product type. The derived results are new even for Euclidean spaces.
