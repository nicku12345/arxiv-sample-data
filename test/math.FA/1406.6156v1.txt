We present a Lebesgue-type decomposition for a representable functional on a ^*-algebra into absolutely continuous and singular parts with respect to an other. This generalizes the corresponding results of S. P. Gudder for unital Banach ^*-algebras. We also prove that the corresponding absolutely continuous parts are absolutely continuous with respect to each other.
