In this article we study the basic theoretical properties of Mellin-type fractional integrals, known as generalizations of the Hadamard-type fractional integrals. We give a new approach and version, specifying their semigroup property, their domain and range. Moreover we introduce a notion of strong fractional Mellin derivatives and we study the connections with the pointwise fractional Mellin derivative, which is defined by means of Hadamard-type fractional integrals. One of the main results is a fractional version of the fundamental theorem of differential and integral calculus in the Mellin frame. In fact, in this article it will be shown that the very foundations of Mellin transform theory and the corresponding analysis are quite different to those of the Fourier transform, alone since even in the simplest non-fractional case the integral operator (i.e. the anti-differentiation operator) applied to a function f will turn out to be the R \int_0^x f(u)du=u with derivative (xd/dx)f(x). Thus the fundamental theorem in the Mellin sense is valid in this form, one which stands apart from the classical Newtonian integral and derivative. Among the applications two fractional order partial differential equations are studied.
