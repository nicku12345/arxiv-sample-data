Let E be a Riesz space and let E^{\sim} denote its order dual. The orthomorphisms Orth(E) on E, and the ideal center Z(E) of E, are naturally embedded in Orth(E^{\sim}) and Z(E^{\sim}) respectively. We construct two unital algebra and order continuous Riesz homomorphisms \[ \gamma:((Orth(E))^{\sim})_{n}^{\sim}\rightarrow Orth(E^{\sim})\text{ }% \] and \[ m:Z(E)^{\prime\prime}\rightarrow Z(E^{\sim}) \] that extend the above mentioned natural inclusions respectively. Then, the range of \gamma is an order ideal in Orth(E^{\sim}) if and only if m is surjective. Furthermore, m is surjective if and only if E has a topologically full center. (That is, the \sigma(E,E^{\sim})-closure of Z(E)x contains the order ideal generated by x for each x\in E_{+}.) As a consequence, E has a topologically full center Z(E) if and only if Z(E^{\sim})=\pi\cdot Z(E)^{\prime\prime} for some idempotent \pi\in Z(E)^{\prime\prime}.
