The notions of p-convexity and q-concavity are mostly known because of their importance as a tool in the study of isomorphic properties of Banach lattices, but they also play a role in several results involving linear maps between Banach spaces and Banach lattices. In this paper we introduce Lipschitz versions of these concepts, dealing with maps between metric spaces and Banach lattices, and start by proving nonlinear versions of two well-known factorization theorems through L_p spaces due to Maurey/Nikishin and Krivine. We also show that a Lipschitz map from a metric space into a Banach lattice is Lipschitz p-convex if and only if its linearization is p-convex. Furthermore, we elucidate why there is such a close relationship between the linear and nonlinear concepts by proving characterizations of Lipschitz p-convex and Lipschitz q-concave maps in terms of factorizations through p-convex and q-concave Banach lattices, respectively, in the spirit of the work of Raynaud and Tradacete.
