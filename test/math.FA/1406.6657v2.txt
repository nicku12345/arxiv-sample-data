It is well known that an ordered normed vector space X with normal cone X_+ has an order-preserving norm that is equivalent to the original norm. Such an equivalent order-preserving norm is given by \begin{equation} \sharp x \sharp = \max \{ d(x, X_+), d(x, - X_+)\}, \qquad x \in X. \end{equation} This paper explores the properties of this norm and of the half-norm \psi(x) = d(x,-X_+) independently of whether or not the cone is normal. We use \psi to derive comparison principles for the solutions of abstract integral equations, derive conditions for point-dissipativity of nonlinear positive maps, compare Collatz-Wielandt numbers, bounds, and order spectral radii for bounded homogeneous maps and give conditions for a local upper Collatz-Wielandt radius to have a lower positive eigenvector.
