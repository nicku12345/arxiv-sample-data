We show that Rochberg's generalizared interpolation spaces \mathscr Z^{(n)} arising from analytic families of Banach spaces form exact sequences 0\to \mathscr Z^{(n)} \to \mathscr Z^{(n+k)} \to \mathscr Z^{(k)} \to 0. We study some structural properties of those sequences; in particular, we show that nontriviality, having strictly singular quotient map, or having strictly cosingular embedding depend only on the basic case n=k=1. If we focus on the case of Hilbert spaces obtained from the interpolation scale of \ell_p spaces, then \mathscr Z^{(2)} becomes the well-known Kalton-Peck Z_2 space; we then show that \mathscr Z^{(n)} is (or embeds in, or is a quotient of) a twisted Hilbert space only if n=1,2, which solves a problem posed by David Yost; and that it does not contain \ell_2 complemented unless n=1. We construct another nontrivial twisted sum of Z_2 with itself that contains \ell_2 complemented.
