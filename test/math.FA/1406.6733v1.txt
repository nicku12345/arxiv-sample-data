A Banach space E is said to be injective if for every Banach space X and every subspace Y of X every operator t:Y\to E has an extension T:X\to E. We say that E is \aleph-injective (respectively, universally \aleph-injective) if the preceding condition holds for Banach spaces X (respectively Y) with density less than a given uncountable cardinal \aleph. We perform a study of \aleph-injective and universally \aleph-injective Banach spaces which extends the basic case where \aleph=\aleph_1 is the first uncountable cardinal. When dealing with the corresponding "isometric" properties we arrive to our main examples: ultraproducts and spaces of type C(K). We prove that ultraproducts built on countably incomplete \aleph-good ultrafilters are (1,\aleph)-injective as long as they are Lindenstrauss spaces. We characterize (1,\aleph)-injective C(K) spaces as those in which the compact K is an F_\aleph-space (disjoint open subsets which are the union of less than \aleph many closed sets have disjoint closures) and we uncover some projectiveness properties of F_\aleph-spaces.
