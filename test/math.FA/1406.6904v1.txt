Countable projective limits of countable inductive limits, called PLB-spaces, of weighted Banach spaces of continuous functions have recently been investigated by Agethen, Bierstedt and Bonet. In a previous article, the author extended their investigation to the case of holomorphic functions and characterized when spaces over the unit disc w.r.t. weights whose decay, roughly speaking, is neither faster nor slower than that of a polynomial are ultrabornological or barrelled. In this note, we prove a similar characterization for the case of weights which tend to zero logarithmically.
