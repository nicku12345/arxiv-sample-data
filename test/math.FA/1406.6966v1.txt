We prove a number of results on integrability and extendability of Lie algebras of unbounded skew-symmetric operators with common dense domain in Hilbert space. By integrability for a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, we mean that there is an associated unitary representation \mathcal{U} of the corresponding simply connected Lie group such that \mathfrak{g} is the differential of \mathcal{U}. Our results extend earlier integrability results in the literature; and are new even in the case of a single operator. Our applications include a new invariant for certain Riemann surfaces.
