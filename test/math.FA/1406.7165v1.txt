We establish a criterion to decide when a countable projective limit of countable inductive limits of normed spaces is bornological. We compare the conditions occurring within our criterion with well-known abstract conditions from the context of homological algebra and with conditions arising within the investigation of weighted PLB-spaces of continuous functions.
