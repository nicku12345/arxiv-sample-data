We consider Hilbert algebras with a supplementary Fr\'echet topology and get various extensions of the algebraic structure by using duality techniques. In particular we obtain optimal multiplier-type involutive algebras, which in applications are large enough to be of significant practical use. The setting covers many situations arising from quantization rules, as those involving square-integrable families of bounded operators.
