In this work we discuss several ways to extend to the context of Banach spaces the notion of Hilbert-Schmidt operators: p-summing operators, \gamma-summing or \gamma-radonifying operators, weakly *1-nuclear operators and classes of operators defined via factorization properties. We introduce the class PS_2(E; F) of pre-Hilbert-Schmidt operators as the class of all operators u:E\to F such that w\circ u \circ v is Hilbert-Schmidt for every bounded operator v: H_1\to E and every bounded operator w:F\to H_2, where H_1 et H_2 are Hilbert spaces. Besides the trivial case where one of the spaces E or F is a "Hilbert-Schmidt space", this space seems to have been described only in the easy situation where one of the spaces E or F is a Hilbert space.
