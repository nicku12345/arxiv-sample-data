For a given generalized Nevanlinna function Q\in N_{\kappa }\left( H \right), we study decompositions that satisfy: Q=Q_{1}+Q_{2}; Q_{i}{\in N}_{\kappa_{i}}\left( H \right), and \kappa_{1}+\kappa_{2}=\kappa , 0\le \kappa_{i}, which we call desirable decompositions. In this paper, some sufficient conditions for such decompositions of Q are given.   One of the main results is a new operator representation of \hat{Q}\left(z\right):=-{Q(z)}^{-1} if Q\left( z \right):=\Gamma_{0}^{+}\left( A-z\right)^{-1}\Gamma_{0}, where A is a bounded self-adjoint operator in a Pontryagin space. The new representation is used to get an interesting desirable decomposition of \hat{Q} and to obtain some information about singularities of \hat{Q}.
