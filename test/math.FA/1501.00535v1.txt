In this paper, we investigate the notion \phi-injectivity for Banach A-modules, where \phi is a character on A. We obtain some hereditary properties of \phi-injectivity for certain classes of Banach modules related to closed ideals. These results allow us to study \phi-injectivity of certain Banach A-modules in commutative case, specially \ell^{1}-semilattice algebras. As an application, we give an example of a non-injective Banach module which is \phi-injective for each character \phi.
