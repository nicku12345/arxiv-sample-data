We extend the well known theory of s-numbers of linear operators to homogeneous polynomials defined between Banach spaces.   Approximation, Kolmogorov and Gelfand numbers of polynomials are introduced and some well-known results of the linear and multilinear settings are obtained for homogeneous polynomials.
