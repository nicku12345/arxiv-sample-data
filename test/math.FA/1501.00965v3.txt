In this note, among other results, we find the optimal constants of the generalized Bohnenblust--Hille inequality for m-linear forms over \mathbb{R} and with multiple exponents \left( 1,2,...,2\right) , sometimes called mixed \left( \ell _{1},\ell _{2}\right) -Littlewood inequality. We show that these optimal constants are precisely \left( \sqrt{2}\right) ^{m-1} and this is somewhat surprising since a series of recent papers have shown that similar constants have a sublinear growth. This result answers a question raised by Albuquerque \textit{et al.} in a paper published in 2014 in the \textit{Journal of Functional Analysis}.
