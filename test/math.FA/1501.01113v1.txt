In this study, we define the spaces \mathcal{M}_{u}(\Delta),\mathcal{C}_{p}(\Delta),\mathcal{C}_{0p}(\Delta), \mathcal{C}_{r}(\Delta) and \mathcal{L}_{q}(\Delta) of double sequences whose difference transforms are bounded , convergent in the Pringsheim's sense, null in the Pringsheim's sense, both convergent in the Pringsheim's sense and bounded, regularly convergent and absolutely q-summable, respectively, and also examine some inclusion relations related to those sequence spaces. Furthermore, we show that these sequence spaces are Banach spaces . We determine the alpha-dual of the space \mathcal{M}_{u}(\Delta) and the \beta(v)-dual of the space \mathcal{C}_{\eta}(\Delta) of double sequences, where v,\eta\in \{p,bp,r\}. Finally, we characterize the classes (\mu:\mathcal{C}_{v}(\Delta)) for v\in \{p,bp,r\} of four dimensional matrix transformations, where \mu is any given space of double sequences.
