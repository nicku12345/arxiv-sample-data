In \cite{Troitsky:05,Korostenski:08}, the authors introduced and studied the space \mathcal M_r of regular martingales on a vector lattice and the space M_r of bounded regular martingales on a Banach lattice. In this note, we study these two spaces from the vector lattice point of view. We show, in particular, that these spaces need not be vector lattices. However, if the underlying space is order complete then \mathcal M_r is a vector lattice and M_r is a Banach lattice under the regular norm.
