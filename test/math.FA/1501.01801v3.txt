Let \Omega be a smooth bounded domain in {\mathbb R}^n, 0\textless{}s\textless{}\infty and 1\le p\textless{}\infty. We prove that C^\infty(\overline\Omega\, ; {\mathbb S}^1) is dense in W^{s,p}(\Omega ; {\mathbb S}^1) except when 1\le sp\textless{}2 and n\ge 2. The main ingredient is a new approximation method for W^{s,p}-maps when s\textless{}1. With 0\textless{}s\textless{}1, 1\le p\textless{}\infty and sp\textless{}n, \Omega a ball, and N a general compact connected manifold, we prove that C^\infty(\overline\Omega \, ; N) is dense in W^{s,p}(\Omega \, ; N) if and only if \pi\_{[sp]}(N)=0. This supplements analogous results obtained by Bethuel when s=1, and by Bousquet, Ponce and Van Schaftingen when s=2,3,\ldots [General domains \Omega have been treated by Hang and Lin when s=1; our approach allows to extend their result to s\textless{}1.] The case where s\textgreater{}1, s\not\in{\mathbb N}, is still open.
