The parallel sum A:B of two bounded positive linear operators A,B on a Hilbert space H is defined to be the positive operator having the quadratic form   \begin{equation*}   \inf\{(A(x-y)\,|\,x-y)+(By\,|\,y)\,|\,y\in H\}   \end{equation*} for fixed x\in H. The purpose of this paper is to provide a factorization of the parallel sum of the form J_APJ_A^* where J_A is the embedding operator of an auxiliary Hilbert space associated with A and B, and P is an orthogonal projection onto a certain linear subspace of that Hilbert space. We give similar factorizations of the parallel sum of nonnegative Hermitian forms, positive operators of a complex Banach space E into its topological anti-dual \bar{E}', and of representable positive functionals on a ^*-algebra.
