Our aim in this paper is to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for weighted shift operators on the Hilbert spaces \ell^{2}(\mathbb Z) and \ell^{2}(\mathbb N) to be subspace-transitive, consequently, we show that the Herrero question (D. A. Herrero. Limits of hypercyclic and supercyclic operators, J. Funct. Anal., 99 (1991)179-190) holds true even on a subspace of a Hilbert space, i.e. there exists an operator T such that both T and T^* are subspace-hypercyclic operators for some subspaces. We display the conditions on the direct sum of two invertable bilateral forward weighted shift operators to be subspace-hypercyclic.
