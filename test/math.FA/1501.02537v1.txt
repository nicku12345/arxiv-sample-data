In this paper, we prove that if T is diskcyclic operator then the closed unit disk multiplied by the union of the numerical range of all iterations of T is dense in \mathcal H. Also, if T is diskcyclic operator and |\lambda|\le 1, then T-\lambda I has dense range. Moreover, we prove that if \alpha >1, then \frac{1}{\alpha}T is hypercyclic in a separable Hilbert space \mathcal H if and only if T \oplus \alpha I_{\mathbb{C}} is diskcyclic in \mathcal H \oplus \mathbb{C}. We show at least in some cases a diskcyclic operator has an invariant, dense linear subspace or an infinite dimensional closed linear subspace, whose non-zero elements are diskcyclic vectors. However, we give some counterexamples to show that not always a diskcyclic operator has such a subspace.
