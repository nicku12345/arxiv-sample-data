Let \Gamma be a fractal h-set and {\mathbb{B}}^{{\sigma}}_{p,q}(\Gamma) be a trace space of Besov type defined on \Gamma. While we dealt in [9] with growth envelopes of such spaces mainly and investigated the existence of traces in detail in [12], we now study continuous embeddings between different spaces of that type on \Gamma. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for such an embedding to hold, and can prove in some cases complete characterisations. It also includes the situation when the target space is of type L_r(\Gamma) and, as a by-product, under mild assumptions on the h-set \Gamma we obtain the exact conditions on \sigma, p and q for which the trace space {\mathbb{B}}^{{\sigma}}_{p,q}(\Gamma) exists. We can also refine some embedding results for spaces of generalised smoothness on \mathbb R^n.
