In this paper, we show that if the direct sum of two operators is subspace-hypercyclic (satisfies subspace hypercyclic criterion), then both operators are subspace-hypercyclic (satisfy subspace hypercyclic criterion). Moreover, if an operator T satisfies subspace-hypercyclic criterion, then so T\oplus T does. Also, we obtain that under certain conditions, if T\oplus T is hypercyclic then T satisfies subspace-hypercyclic criterion and, the subspace-hypercyclic operators satisfy subspace-hypercyclic criterion which gives the "subspace-hypercyclic" analogue of Theorem 2.3. (in Hereditarily hypercyclic operators, J. Funct. Anal., 167:94--112, 1999 by P. B\'es and A. Peris).
