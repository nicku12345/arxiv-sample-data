In most classical holomorphic function spaces on the unit disk, a function f can be approximated in the norm of the space by its dilates f\_r(z):=f(rz)~(r \textless{} 1). We show that this is \emph{not} the case for the de Branges--Rovnyak spaces \cH(b). More precisely, we give an example of a non-extreme point b of the unit ball of H^\infty and a function f\in\cH(b) such that \lim\_{r\to1^-}\|f\_r\|\_{\cH(b)}=\infty. It is known that, if b is a non-extreme point of the unit ball of H^\infty, then polynomials are dense in \cH(b). We give the first constructive proof of this fact.
