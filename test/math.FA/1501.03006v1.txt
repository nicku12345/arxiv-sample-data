In this paper, we improve and generalize the operator versions of Kantorovich and Wielandt inequalities for positive linear maps on Hilbert space. Our results are more extensive and precise than many previous results due to Fu and He [Linear Multilinear Algebra, doi: 10. 1080/03081087. 2014. 880432.] and Zhang [Banach J. Math. Anal., 9 (2015), no. 1, 166-172.].
