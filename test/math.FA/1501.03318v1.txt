In this paper, we introduce and analyze a new iterative algorithm for solving a class of variational inclusions involving H-monotone operators. The strong convergence of this algorithm is proved and estimate of its convergence rate is supplied as an answer to an open question posed by Huang and Noor [Huang, Z., Noor, M. A. (2007). Equivalency of convergence between one-step iteration algorithm and two-step iteration algorithm of variational inclusions for H-monotone mappings. Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 53(10), 1567-1571.].
