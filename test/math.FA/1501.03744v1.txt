Let \alpha,\beta be orientation-preserving diffeomorphism (shifts) of \mathbb{R}_+=(0,\infty) onto itself with the only fixed points 0 and \infty and U_\alpha,U_\beta be the isometric shift operators on L^p(\mathbb{R}_+) given by U_\alpha f=(\alpha')^{1/p}(f\circ\alpha), U_\beta f=(\beta')^{1/p}(f\circ\beta), and P_2^\pm=(I\pm S_2)/2 where \[ (S_2 f)(t):=\frac{1}{\pi i}\int\limits_0^\infty \left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)^{1/2-1/p}\frac{f(\tau)}{\tau-t}\,d\tau, \quad t\in\mathbb{R}_+, \] is the weighted Cauchy singular integral operator. We prove that if \alpha',\beta' and c,d are continuous on \mathbb{R}_+ and slowly oscillating at 0 and \infty, and \[ \limsup_{t\to s}|c(t)|<1, \quad \limsup_{t\to s}|d(t)|<1, \quad s\in\{0,\infty\}, \] then the operator (I-cU_\alpha)P_2^++(I-dU_\beta)P_2^- is Fredholm on L^p(\mathbb{R}_+) and its index is equal to zero. Moreover, its regularizers are described.
