Generalized Toeplitz plus Hankel operators T(a)+H_{\alpha}(b) generated by functions a,b and a linear fractional Carleman shift \alpha changing the orientation of the unit circle \mathbb{T} are considered on the Hardy spaces H^p(\mathbb{T}), 1<p<\infty. If the functions a,b\in L^\infty(\mathbb{T}) and satisfy the condition    a(t) a(\alpha(t))=b(t) b(\alpha(t)),\quad t\in \mathbb{T},  the defect numbers of the operators T(a)+H_{\alpha}(b) are established and an explicit description of the structure of the kernels and cokernels of the operators mentioned is given.
