This paper constructs a counterexample showing that not every locally L^0--convex topology is necessarily induced by a family of L^0--seminorms. Random convex analysis is the analytic foundation for L^0--convex conditional risk measures, this counterexample, however, shows that a locally L^0--convex module is not a proper framework for random convex analysis. Further, this paper also gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a locally L^0--convex topology to be induced by a family of L^0--seminorms. Finally, we give some comments showing that based on random locally convex modules, we can establish a perfect random convex analysis to meet the needs of the study of L^0--convex conditional risk measures.
