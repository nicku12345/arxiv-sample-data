Let f,g:\Bbb{R}^{N}\rightarrow (-\infty ,\infty ] be Borel measurable, bounded below and such that \inf f+\inf g\geq 0. We prove that with  m_{f,g}:=(\inf f-\inf g)/2, the inequality ||(f-m_{f,g})^{-1}||_{\phi }+||(g+m_{f,g})^{-1}||_{\phi }\leq 4||(f\Box g)^{-1}||_{\phi } holds in every Orlicz space L_{\phi }, where f\Box g denotes the infimal convolution of f and g and where ||\cdot ||_{\phi } is the Luxemburg norm (i.e., the L^{p} norm when L_{\phi }=L^{p}).   Although no genuine reverse inequality can hold in any generality, we also prove that such reverse inequalities do exist in the form ||(f\Box g)^{-1}||_{\phi }\leq 2^{N-1}(||(\check{f}-m_{f,g})^{-1}||_{\phi }+||(\check{ g}+m_{f,g})^{-1}||_{\phi }), where \check{f} and \check{g} are suitable transforms of f and g introduced in the paper and reminiscent of, yet very different from, nondecreasing rearrangement.   Similar inequalities are proved for other extremal operations and applications are given to the long-time behavior of the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi and related equations.
