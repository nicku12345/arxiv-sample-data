This paper studies three natural pre-orders of increasing generality on the set of all completely non-unitary partial isometries with equal defect indices. We show that the problem of determining when one partial isometry is less than another with respect to these pre-orders is equivalent to the existence of a bounded (or isometric) multiplier between two natural reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. For large classes of partial isometries these spaces can be realized as the well-known model subspaces and deBranges-Rovnyak spaces. This characterization is applied to investigate properties of these pre-orders and the equivalence classes they generate.
