Let \varphi\colon X\to Y be an affine continuous surjection between compact convex sets. Suppose that the canonical copy of the space of real-valued affine continuous functions on Y in the space of real-valued affine continuous functions on X is complemented. We show that if F is a topological vector space, then f\colon Y\to F is of affine Baire class \alpha whenever the composition f\circ\varphi is of affine Baire class \alpha. This abstract result is applied to extend known results on affine Baire classes of strongly affine Baire mappings.
