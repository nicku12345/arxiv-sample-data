The classical Beurling-Helson-Lowdenslager theorem characterizes the shift-invariant subspaces of the Hardy space H^{2} and of the Lebesgue space L^{2}. In this paper, which is self-contained, we define a very general class of norms \alpha and define spaces H^{\alpha} and L^{\alpha}. We then extend the Beurling-Helson-Lowdenslager invariant subspace theorem. The idea of the proof is new and quite simple; most of the details involve extending basic well-known \left \Vert {}\right \Vert _{p}-results for our more general norms.
