For a Banach algebra  \mathcal{A} , we introduce various approximate virtual diagonals such as approximate WAP-virtual diagonal and approximate virtual diagonal. For the enveloping dual Banach algebra  F(\mathcal{A})  of  \mathcal{A} , we show that  F(\mathcal{A})  is approximately Connes-amenable if and only if  \mathcal{A}  has an approximate WAP-virtual diagonal. Further, for a discrete group  G , we show that if the group algebra  \ell^1(G)  has an approximate WAP-virtual diagonal, then it has an approximate virtual diagonal.
