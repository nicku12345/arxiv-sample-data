In this paper, we introduce a new notion of biprojectivity, called Connes-biprojective, for dual Banach algebras. We study the relation between this new notion to Connes-amenability and we show that, for a given dual Banach algebra  \mathcal{A} , it is Connes-amenable if and only if  \mathcal{A}  is Connes-biprojective and has a bounded approximate identity. Also, for an Arens regular Banach algebra  \mathcal{A} , we show that if  \mathcal{A}  is biprojective, then the dual Banach algebra  \mathcal{A} ^{**}  is Connes-biprojective.
