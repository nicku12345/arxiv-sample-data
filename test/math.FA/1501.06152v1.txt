In 2005, Abdollahi and Rejali, studied the relations between paradoxical decompositions and configurations for semigroups. In the present paper, we introduce another concept of amenability on semigroups and groups which includes amenability of semigroups and inner-amenability of groups. We have the previous known results to semigroups and groups satisfying this concept.
