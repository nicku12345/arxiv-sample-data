Given a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold N^n, we investigate whether the set of bounded Sobolev maps (W^{1, p} \cap L^\infty) (Q^m; N^n) on the cube Q^m is strongly dense in the Sobolev space W^{1, p} (Q^m; N^n) for 1 \le p \le m. The density always holds when p is not an integer. When p is an integer, the density can fail, and we prove that a quantitative trimming property is equivalent with the density. This new condition is ensured for example by a uniform Lipschitz geometry of N^n. As a byproduct, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong density of the set of smooth maps C^\infty (\overline{Q^m}; N^n) in W^{1, p} (Q^m; N^n).
