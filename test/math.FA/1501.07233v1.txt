A frame is a system of vectors S in Hilbert space \mathscr{H} with properties which allow one to write algorithms for the two operations, analysis and synthesis, relative to S, for all vectors in \mathscr{H}; expressed in norm-convergent series. Traditionally, frame properties are expressed in terms of an S-Gramian, G_{S} (an infinite matrix with entries equal to the inner product of pairs of vectors in S); but still with strong restrictions on the given system of vectors in S, in order to guarantee frame-bounds. In this paper we remove these restrictions on G_{S}, and we obtain instead direct-integral analysis/synthesis formulas. We show that, in spectral subspaces of every finite interval J in the positive half-line, there are associated standard frames, with frame-bounds equal the endpoints of J. Applications are given to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and to random fields.
