Flag kernels are tempered distributions which generalize these of Calderon-Zygmund type. For any homogeneous group \mathbb{G} the class of operators which acts on L^{2}(\mathbb{G}) by convolution with a flag kernel is closed under composition. In the case of the Heisenberg group we prove the inverse-closed property for this algebra. It means that if an operator from this algebra is invertible on L^{2}(\mathbb{G}), then its inversion remains in the class.
