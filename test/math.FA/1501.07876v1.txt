Let f be a regular non-constant symbol defined on the d-dimensional torus {\mathbb T}^d with values on the unit circle. Denote respectively by \kappa and L, its set of critical points and the associated Laurent operator on l^2({\mathbb Z}^d). Let U be a suitable unitary local perturbation of L. We show that the operator U has finite point spectrum and no singular continuous component away from the set f(\kappa). We apply these results and provide a new approach to analyze the spectral properties of GGT matrices with asymptotically constant Verblunsky coefficients. The proofs are based on positive commutator techniques. We also obtain some propagation estimates.
