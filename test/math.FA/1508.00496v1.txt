We present some extensions of classical results that involve elements of the dual of Banach spaces, such as Bishop-Phelp's theorem and James' compactness theorem, but restricting to sets of functionals determined by geometrical properties. The main result, which answers a question posed by F. Delbaen, is the following: Let E be a Banach space such that (B_{E^\ast}, \omega^\ast) is convex block compact. Let A and B be bounded, closed and convex sets with distance d(A,B) > 0. If every x^\ast \in E^\ast with \[ \sup(x^\ast,B) < \inf(x^\ast,A) \] attains its infimum on A and its supremum on B, then A and B are both weakly compact.   We obtain new characterizations of weakly compact sets and reflexive spaces, as well as a result concerning a variational problem in dual Banach spaces.
