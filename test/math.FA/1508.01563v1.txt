The aim of this paper is that of discussing Closed Graph Theorems for bornological vector spaces in a way which is accessible to non-experts. We will see how to easily adapt classical arguments of functional analysis over \mathbb{R} and \mathbb{C} to deduce Closed Graph Theorems for bornological vector spaces over any complete, non-trivially valued field, hence encompassing the non-Archimedean case too. We will end this survey by discussing some applications. In particular, we will prove de Wilde's Theorem for non-Archimedean locally convex spaces and then deduce some results about the automatic boundedness of algebra morphisms for a class of bornological algebras of interest in analytic geometry, both Archimedean (complex analytic geometry) and non-Archimedean.
