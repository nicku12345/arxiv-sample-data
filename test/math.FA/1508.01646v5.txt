Let \mathbb{H} be a separable Hilbert space. In this paper we establish a generalization of Walnut's representation and Janssen's representation of the \mathbb{H}-valued Gabor frame operator on \mathbb{H}-valued weighted amalgam spaces W_{\mathbb{H}}(L^p,L^q_v), 1 \leq p, q \leq \infty. Also we show that the frame operator is invertible on W_{\mathbb{H}}(L^p,L^q_v), 1 \leq p, q \leq \infty, if the window function is in the Wiener amalgam space W_{\mathbb{H}}(L^{\infty},L^1_w). Further, we obtain the Walnut representation and invertibility of the frame operator corresponding to Gabor superframes and multi-window Gabor frames on W_{\mathbb{H}}(L^p,L^q_v), 1 \leq p, q \leq \infty, as a special case by choosing the appropriate Hilbert space \mathbb{H}.
