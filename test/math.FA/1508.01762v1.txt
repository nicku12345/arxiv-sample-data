In this paper, the behavior of the sampling Kantorovich operators has been studied, when discontinuous signals are considered in the above sampling series. Moreover, the rate of approximation for the family of the above operators is estimated, when uniformly continuous and bounded signals are considered. Further, also the problem of the linear prediction by sampling values from the past is analyzed. At the end, the role of duration-limited kernels in the previous approximation processes has been treated, and several examples have been provided.
