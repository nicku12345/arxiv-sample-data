Let SB be the standard coding for separable Banach spaces as subspaces of C(\Delta). In these notes, we show that if \mathbb{B} \subset \text{SB} is a Borel subset of spaces with separable dual, then the assignment X \mapsto X^* can be realized by a Borel function \mathbb{B}\to \text{SB}. Moreover, this assignment can be done in such a way that the functional evaluation is still well defined (Theorem 1). Also, we prove a Borel parametrized version of Zippin's theorem, i.e., we prove that there exists Z \in \text{SB} and a Borel function that assigns for each X \in \mathbb{B} an isomorphic copy of X inside of Z (Theorem 5).
