For a unit-norm frame F = \{f_i\}_{i=1}^k in \R^n, a scaling is a vector c=(c(1),\dots,c(k))\in \R_{\geq 0}^k such that \{\sqrt{c(i)}f_i\}_{i =1}^k is a Parseval frame in \R^n. If such a scaling exists, F is said to be scalable. A scaling c is a minimal scaling if \{f_i : c(i)>0\} has no proper scalable subframe. It is known that the set of all scalings of F is a convex polytope whose vertices correspond to minimal scalings. In this paper, we provide an estimation of the number of minimal scalings of a scalable frame and a characterization of when minimal scalings are affinely dependent. Using this characterization, we can conclude that all strict scalings c=(c(1),\dots,c(k))\in \R_{> 0}^k of F have the same structural property. We also present the uniqueness of orthogonal partitioning property of any set of minimal scalings, which provides all possible tight subframes of a given scaled frame.
