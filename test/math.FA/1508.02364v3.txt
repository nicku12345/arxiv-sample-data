In this article we study atomic and molecular decompositions in 2-microlocal Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin spaces with variable integrability. We show that, in most cases, the convergence implied in such decompositions holds not only in the distributions sense, but also in the function spaces themselves. As an application, we give a simple proof for the denseness of the Schwartz class in such spaces. Some other properties, like Sobolev embeddings, are also obtained via atomic representations.
