We show that if E is an arbitrary (DFN)-space, then every nontrivial convolution operator on the Fr\'echet nuclear space \mathcal{H}(E) is mixing, in particular hypercyclic. More generally we obtain the same conclusion when E=F^{\prime}_c, where F is a separable Fr\'echet space with the approximation property. On the opposite direction we show that a translation operator on the space \mathcal{H}(\mathbb{C}^{\mathbb{N}})  is never hypercyclic.
