We show that every dominated linear operator from an Banach-Kantorovich space over atomless Dedekind complete vector lattice to a sequence Banach lattice l_p({\Gamma}) or c_0({\Gamma}) is narrow. As a conse- quence, we obtain that an atomless Banach lattice cannot have a finite dimensional decomposition of a certain kind. Finally we show that if a linear dominated operator T from lattice-normed space V to Banach- Kantorovich space W is order narrow then the same is its exact dominant \ls T\rs.
