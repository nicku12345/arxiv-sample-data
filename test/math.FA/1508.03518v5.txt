The main goal of the paper is to provide a quantitative lower bound greater than 1 for the relative projection constant \lambda(Y, X), where X is a subspace of \ell_{2p}^m space and Y \subset X is an arbitrary hyperplane. As a consequence, we establish that for every integer n \geq 4 there exists an n-dimensional normed space X such that for an every hyperplane Y and every projection P:X \to Y the inequality ||P|| > 1 + \left (8 \left ( n + 3 \right )^{5} \right )^{-30(n+3)^2} holds. This gives a non-trivial lower bound in a variation of problem proposed by Bosznay and Garay in 1986.
