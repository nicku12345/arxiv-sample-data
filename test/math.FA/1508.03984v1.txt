We study the collection of finite elements \Phi_{1}(\mathcal{U}(E,F)) in the vector lattice \mathcal{U}(E,F) of orthogonally additive, order bounded (called abstract Uryson) operators between two vector lattices E and F, where F is Dedekind complete. In particular, for an atomic vector lattice E it is proved that for a finite element in \phi\in \mathcal{U}(E,\mathbb{R}) there is only a finite set of mutually disjoint atoms, where \phi does not vanish and, for an atomless vector lattice the zero-vector is the only finite element in the band of \sigma-laterally continuous abstract Uryson functionals. We also describe the ideal \Phi_{1}(\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m)) for n,m\in\mathbb{N} and consider rank one operators to be finite elements in \mathcal{U}(E,F).
