In this paper, we obtain a minimax theorem by means of which, in turn, we prove the following result:   Let E be an infinite-dimensional reflexive real Banach space, T:E\to E a non-zero compact linear operator, \varphi:E\to {\bf R} a lower semicontinuous, convex and coercive functional, I\subset {\bf R} a compact interval, with 0\in I, \psi:I\to {\bf R} a lower semicontinuous convex function. Then, for each r>\varphi(0), one has \sup_{x\in X}\inf_{\lambda\in I}(\varphi(T(x)-\lambda x)+\psi(\lambda))=r+\psi(0)\ , where X=\{x\in E : \varphi(T(x))\leq r\}\ .
