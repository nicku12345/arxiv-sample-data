We extend to n-dimensions a characterization of the Marcinkiewicz L(p,\infty) spaces first obtained by Garsia-Rodemich in the one dimensional case. This leads to a new proof of the John-Nirenberg self-improving inequalities. We also show a related result that provides a still a new characterization of the L(p,\infty) spaces in terms of distribution functions, reflects the self-improving inequalities directly, and also characterizes L(\infty,\infty), the rearrangement invariant hull of BMO. We show an application to the study of tensor products with L(\infty,\infty) spaces, which complements the classical work of O'Neil \cite{oneil} and the more recent work of Astashkin \cite{astashkin}.
