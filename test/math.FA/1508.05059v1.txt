We prove that if  C  is a family of separable Banach spaces which is analytic with respect to the Effros-Borel structure and none member of  C  is isometrically universal for all separable Banach spaces, then there exists a separable Banach space with a monotone Schauder basis which is isometrically universal for  C  but still not for all separable Banach spaces. We also establish an analogous result for the class of strictly convex spaces.
