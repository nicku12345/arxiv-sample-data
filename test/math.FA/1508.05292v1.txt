In this paper, we are dealing with a new type of Baskakov-Schurer-Szasz operators (\ref{eq1}). Approximation properties of this operators are explored: the rate of convergence in terms of the usual moduli of smoothness is given, the convergence in certain weighted spaces is investigated. We study q-analogues of Baskakov-Schurer-Sz\'{a}sz operators and it's Stancu generalization. In the last section, we give better error estimations for the operators (\ref{eq2}) using King type approach and obtained weighted statistical approximation properties for operator (\ref{qb})
