In the present paper we discuss the approximation properties of Jain-Baskakov operators with parameter c. The present paper deals with the modified forms of the Baskakov basis functions. We establish some direct results, which include the asymptotic formula and error estimation in terms of the modulus of continuity and weighted approximation.
