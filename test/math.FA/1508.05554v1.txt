We prove that the Lorentz sequence space \ell_{\frac{2m}{m+1},1} is, in a~precise sense, optimal among all symmetric Banach sequence spaces satisfying a Bohnenblust-Hille type inequality for m-linear forms or m-homogeneous polynomials on \mathbb{C}^n. Motivated by this result we develop methods for dealing with subtle Bohnenblust-Hille type inequalities in the setting of Lorentz spaces. Based on an interpolation approach and the Blei-Fournier inequalities involving mixed type spaces, we prove multilinear and polynomial Bohnenblust-Hille type inequalities in Lorentz spaces with subpolynomial and subexponential constants. Improving a remarkable result of Balasubramanian-Calado-Queff\'elec, we show an application to the theory of Dirichlet series.
