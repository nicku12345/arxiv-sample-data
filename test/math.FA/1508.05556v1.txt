We prove Nikol'skii type inequalities which for polynomials on the n-dimensional torus \mathbb{T}^n relate the L^p-with the L^q-norm (with respect to the normalized Lebesgue measure and 0 <p <q < \infty). Among other things we show that C=\sqrt{q/p} is the best constant such that \|P\|_{L^q}\leq C^{\text{deg}(P)} \|P\|_{L^p} for all homogeneous polynomials P on \mathbb{T}^n. We also prove an exact inequality between the L^p-norm of a polynomial P on \mathbb{T}^n and its Mahler measure M(P), which is the geometric mean of |P| with respect to the normalized Lebesgue measure on \mathbb{T}^n. Using extrapolation we transfer this estimate into a Khintchine-Kahane type inequality, which, for polynomials on \mathbb{T}^n, relates a certain exponential Orlicz norm and Mahler's measure. Applications are given, including some interpolation estimates.
