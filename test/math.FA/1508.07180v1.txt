For the Dunkl operator \Lambda_\alpha (\alpha > -1/2) on the space of entire functions on the complex space C, the critical rate of growth for the integral means M_p(f,r) of their hypercyclic functions f is obtained. The rate of growth of the corresponding frequently hypercyclic functions is also analyzed.
