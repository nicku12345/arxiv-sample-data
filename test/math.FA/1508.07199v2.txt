The validity of the von-Neumann inequality for commuting n - tuples of 3\times 3 matrices remains open for n\geq 3. We give a partial answer to this question, which is used to obtain a necessary condition for the Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r interpolation problem on the polydisc \mathbb D^n. In the special case of n=2 (which follows from Ando's theorem as well), this necessary condition is made explicit. An alternative approach to the Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r interpolation problem, in the special case of n=2, adapting a theorem of Kor\'{a}nyi and Puk\'{a}nzsky is given. As a consequence, a class of polynomials are isolated for which a complete solution to the Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r interpolation problem is easily obtained. A natural generalization of the Hankel operators on the Hardy space of H^2(\mathbb T^2) then becomes apparent. Many of our results remain valid for any n\in \mathbb N, however, the computations are somewhat cumbersome for n>2 and are omitted. The inequality \lim_{n\to \infty}C_2(n)\leq 2 K^\mathbb C_G, where K_G^\mathbb C is the complex Grothendieck constant and \[C_2(n)=\sup\big\{\|p(\boldsymbol T)\|:\|p\|_{\mathbb D^n,\infty}\leq 1, \|\boldsymbol T\|_{\infty} \leq 1 \big\}\] is due to Varopoulos. Here the supremum is taken over all complex polynomials p in n variables of degree at most 2 and commuting n - tuples \boldsymbol T:=(T_1,\ldots,T_n) of contractions. We show that \[\lim_{n\to \infty}C_2(n)\leq \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} K^\mathbb C_G\] obtaining a slight improvement in the inequality of Varopoulos. We show that the normed linear space \ell^1(n), n>1, has no isometric embedding into k\times k complex matrices for any k\in \mathbb N and discuss several infinite dimensional operator space structures on it.
