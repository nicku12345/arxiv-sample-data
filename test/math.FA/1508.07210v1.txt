An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is a set of unit vectors whose coherence achieves the Welch bound, and so is as incoherent as possible. They arise in numerous applications. It is well known that real ETFs are equivalent to a certain subclass of strongly regular graphs. In this note, we give some alternative techniques for understanding this equivalence. In a later document, we will use these techniques to further generalize this theory.
