Let X be a completely regular topological space. We assign to each (set theoretic) ideal of X an (algebraic) ideal of C_B(X), the normed algebra of continuous bounded complex valued mappings on X equipped with the supremum norm. We then prove several representation theorems for the assigned ideals of C_B(X). This is done by associating a certain subspace of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification \beta X of X to each ideal of X. This subspace of \beta X has a simple representation, and in the case when the assigned ideal of C_B(X) is closed, coincides with its spectrum as a C^*-subalgebra of C_B(X). This in particular provides information about the spectrum of those closed ideals of C_B(X) which have such representations. This includes the non-vanishing closed ideals of C_B(X) whose spectrums are studied in great detail. Our representation theorems help to understand the structure of certain ideals of C_B(X). This has been illustrated by means of various examples. Our approach throughout will be quite topological and makes use of the theory of the Stone--\v{C}ech compactification.
