For any measurable set E of a measure space (X, \mu), let P_E be the (orthogonal) projection on the Hilbert space L^2(X, \mu) with the range ran \, P_E = \{f \in L^2(X, \mu) : f = 0 \ \ a.e. \ on \ E^c\} that is called a standard subspace of L^2(X, \mu). Let T be an operator on L^2(X, \mu) having increasing spectrum relative to standard compressions, that is, for any measurable sets E and F with E \subseteq F, the spectrum of the operator P_E T|_{ran \, P_E} is contained in the spectrum of the operator P_F T|_{ran \, P_F}. In 2009, Marcoux, Mastnak and Radjavi asked whether the operator T has a non-trivial invariant standard subspace. They answered this question affirmatively when either the measure space (X, \mu) is discrete or the operator T has finite rank. We study this problem in the case of trace-class kernel operators. We also slightly strengthen the above-mentioned result for finite-rank operators.
