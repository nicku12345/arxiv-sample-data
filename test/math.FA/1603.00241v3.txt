Let \mathbb{H} be a Hilbert space, E \subset \mathbb{H} be an arbitrary subset and f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \: G: E \rightarrow \mathbb{H} be two functions. We give a necessary and sufficient condition on the pair (f,G) for the existence of a \textit{convex} function F\in C^{1,1}(\mathbb{H}) such that F=f and \nabla F =G on E. We also show that, if this condition is met, F can be taken so that \textrm{Lip}(\nabla F) = \textrm{Lip}(G). We give a geometrical application of this result, concerning interpolation of sets by boundaries of C^{1,1} convex bodies in \mathbb{H}. Finally, we give a counterexample to a related question concerning smooth convex extensions of smooth convex functions with derivatives which are not uniformly continuous.
