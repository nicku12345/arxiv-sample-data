Moment problems and orthogonal polynomials, both meant in a single real variable, belong to the oldest problems in Classical Analysis. They have been developing for over a century in two parallel, mostly independent streams. During the last 20 years a rapid advancement of polynomials orthogonal in Sobolev space has been noticed; their moment counterpart seems to be not paid enough attention as it deserves. In this paper we intend to resume the theme and open the door for further, deeper study of the problem.
