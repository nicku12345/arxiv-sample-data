Let H be a separable Hilbert space, A_c:\mathcal D_c\subset H\to H a densely defined unbounded operator, bounded from below, let \mathcal D_{\min} be the domain of the closure of A_c and \mathcal D_{\max} that of the adjoint. Assume that \mathcal D_{\max} with the graph norm is compactly contained in H and that \mathcal D_{\min} has finite positive codimension in \mathcal D_{\max}. Then the set of domains of selfadjoint extensions of A_c has the structure of a finite-dimensional manifold \mathfrak {SA} and the spectrum of each of its selfadjoint extensions is bounded from below. If \zeta is strictly below the spectrum of A with a given domain \mathcal D_0\in \mathfrak {SA}, then \zeta is not in the spectrum of A with domain \mathcal D\in \mathfrak {SA} near \mathcal D_0. But \mathfrak {SA} contains elements \mathcal D_0 with the property that for every neighborhood U of \mathcal D_0 and every \zeta\in \mathbb R there is \mathcal D\in U such that \mathrm{spec}(A_\mathcal D)\cap (-\infty,\zeta)\ne \emptyset. We characterize these "spectrally unstable" domains as being those satisfying a nontrivial relation with the domain of the Friedrichs extension of A_c.
