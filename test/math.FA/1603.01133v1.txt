For a Banach space X, a sequence of Banach spaces (Y_n), and a Banach space Z with an unconditional basis, D. Alspach and B. Sari introduced a generalization of a Bourgain tree called a (\oplus_n Y_n)_Z-tree in X. These authors also prove that any separable Banach space admitting a (\oplus_n Y_n)_Z-tree with order \omega_1 admits a subspace isomorphic to (\oplus_n Y_n)_Z. In this paper we give two new proofs of this result.
