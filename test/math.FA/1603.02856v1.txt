We consider the complex solvable non-commutative two dimensional Lie algebra L, L=<y>\oplus <x>, with Lie bracket [x,y]=y, as linear bounded operators acting on a complex Hilbert space H. Under the assumption R(y) closed, we reduce the computation of the joint spectra Sp(L,E), \sigma_{\delta ,k}(L,E) and \sigma_{\pi ,k}(L,E), k= 0,1,2, to the computation of the spectrum, the approximate point spectrum, and the approximate compression spectrum of a single operator. Besides, we also study the case y^2=0, and we apply our results to the case H finite dimensional.
