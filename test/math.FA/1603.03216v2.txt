We prove that every unconditionally summable sequence in a Hilbert space can be factorized as the product of a square summable scalar sequence and a Bessel sequence. Some consequences on the representation of unconditionally convergent multipliers are obtained, thus providing positive answers to a conjecture by Balazs and Stoeva in some particular cases.
