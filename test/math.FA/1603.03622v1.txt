In this short note is on the equivalence between non-Newtonian metric (particularly multiplicative metric) and metric. We present a different proof the fact that the notion of a non-Newtonian metric space is not more general than that of a metric space. Also, we emphasize that a lot of fixed point results in the non-Newtonian metric setting can be directly obtained from their metric counterparts.
