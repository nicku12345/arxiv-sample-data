Let P be an m-homogeneous polynomial in n-complex variables x_1, \dotsc, x_n. Clearly, P has a unique representation in the form \begin{equation*} P(x)= \sum_{1 \leq j_1 \leq \dotsc \leq j_m \leq n} c_{(j_1, \dotsc, j_m)} \, x_{j_1} \dotsb x_{j_m} \,, \end{equation*} and the m"~form \begin{equation*} L_P(x^{(1)}, \dotsc, x^{(m)})= \sum_{1 \leq j_1 \leq \dotsc \leq j_m \leq n} c_{(j_1, \dotsc, j_m)} \, x^{(1)}_{j_1} \dotsb x^{(m)}_{j_m} \end{equation*} satisfies L_P(x,\dotsc, x) = P(x) for every x\in\mathbb{C}^n. We show that, although L_P in general is non-symmetric, for a large class of reasonable norms  \lVert \cdot \rVert  on \mathbb{C}^n the norm of L_P on (\mathbb{C}^n, \lVert \cdot \rVert )^m up to a logarithmic term (c \log n)^{m^2} can be estimated by the norm of P on  (\mathbb{C}^n, \lVert \cdot \rVert ); here c \ge 1 denotes a universal constant. Moreover, for the \ell_p"~norms  \lVert \cdot \rVert_p, 1 \leq p < 2 the logarithmic term in the number n of variables is even superfluous.
