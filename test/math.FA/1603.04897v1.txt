Piecewise affine functions on subsets of \mathbb R^m were studied in \cite{Ovchinnikov:02,Aliprantis:06a,Aliprantis:07a,Aliprantis:07}. In this paper we study a more general concept of a locally piecewise affine function. We characterize locally piecewise affine functions in terms of components and regions. We prove that a positive function is locally piecewise affine iff it is the supremum of a locally finite sequence of piecewise affine functions. We prove that locally piecewise affine functions are uniformly dense in C(\mathbb R^m), while piecewise affine functions are sequentially order dense in C(\mathbb R^m).   This paper is partially based on \cite{Adeeb:14}.
