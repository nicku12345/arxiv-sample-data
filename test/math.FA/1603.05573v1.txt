We show that for every weakly compact subset K of C[0,1] with finite Cantor-Bendixson rank, there is a reflexive Banach lattice E and an operator T:E\rightarrow C[0,1] such that K\subseteq T(B_E). On the other hand, we exhibit an example of a weakly compact set of C[0,1] homeomorphic to \omega^\omega+1 for which such T and E cannot exist. This answers a question of M. Talagrand in the 80's.
