Many authors have considered and investigated generalized fractional differential operators. The main object of this present paper is to define a new generalized fractional differential operator \mathfrak{T}^{\beta,\tau,\gamma}, which generalized the Srivastava-Owa operators. Moreover, we investigate of the geometric properties such as univalency, starlikeness, convexity for their normalization. Further, boundedness and compactness in some well known spaces, such as Bloch space for last mention operator also are considered. Our tool is based on the generalized hypergeometric function.
