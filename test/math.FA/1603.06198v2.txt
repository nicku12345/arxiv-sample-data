It is shown that certain lower semi-continuous maps from a paracompact space to the family of closed subsets of the bundle space of a Banach bundle admit continuous selections. This generalization of the theorem of Douady, dal Soglio-Herault, and Hofmann on the fullness of Banach bundles has applications to establishing conditions under which the induced maps between the spaces of sections of Banach bundles are onto. Another application is to a generalization of the theorem of Bartle and Graves for Banach bundle maps that are onto their images. Other applications of the selection theorem are to the study begun by Behrends and continued by Gierz of the M-ideals of the space of bounded sections. A class of Banach bundles that generalizes the class of locally trivial bundles is introduced and some properties of the Banach bundles in this class are discussed.
