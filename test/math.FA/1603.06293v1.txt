We discuss the behaviour at infinity of n-times integrated semigroups with nonquasianalytic growth and invertible generator. The results obtained extend in this setting a theorem of O. El Mennaoui on stability of bounded once integrated semigroups, and (partially) a theorem of Q. P. V\tilde{\rm u} on stability of C_0-semigroups.
