The Gurari\u{\i} space is the unique separable Banach space \mathbb{G} which is of almost universal disposition for finite-dimensional Banach spaces, which means that for every \varepsilon>0, for all finite-dimensional normed spaces E \subseteq F, for every isometric embedding {e}\colon{E}\to{\mathbb{G}} there exists an \varepsilon-isometric embedding {f}\colon{F}\to{\mathbb{G}} such that f \restriction E = e.   We show that \mathbb{G}^{\mathbb{N}} with a special sequence of semi-norms is of almost universal disposition for finite-dimensional graded Fr\'echet spaces. The construction relies heavily on the universal operator on the Gurari\u{\i} space, recently constructed by Garbuli\'nska-Wegrzyn and the third author.   This yields in particular that \mathbb{G}^{\mathbb{N}} is universal in the class of all separable Fr\'echet spaces.
