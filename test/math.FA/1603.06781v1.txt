In this paper, we introduce some new I_\lambda-lacunary statistically convergent sequence spaces of order \alpha defined by a Musielak-Orlicz function. We study some relations between I_\lambda-lacunary statistically convergence with lacunary I_\lambda-summable sequences. Moreover we also study about the I_\lambda-lacunary statistically convergence of sequences in topological groups and give some important inclusion theorems.
