Let \mu be an even measure on the real line \mathbb{R} such that c_1 \int_{\mathbb{R}}|f|^2\,dx \le \int_{\mathbb{R}}|f|^2\,d\mu \le c_2\int_{\mathbb{R}}|f|^2\,dx for all functions f in the Paley-Wiener space \mathrm{PW}_{a}. We prove that \mu is the spectral measure for the unique Hamiltonian \mathcal{H}=\left(w&00&\frac{1}{w}\right) on [0,a] generated by a weight w from the Muckenhoupt class A_2[0,a]. As a consequence of this result, we construct Krein's orthogonal entire functions with respect to \mu and prove that every positive, bounded, invertible Wiener-Hopf operator on [0,a] with real symbol admits triangular factorization.
