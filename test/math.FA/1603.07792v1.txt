We prove a trace Hardy type inequality with the best constant on the polyhedral convex cones which generalizes recent results of Alvino et al. and of Tzirakis on the upper half space. We also prove some trace Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya type inequalities which generalize the recent results of Filippas et al.. In applications, we derive some Hardy type inequalities and Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya type inequalities for fractional Laplacian. Finally, we prove the logarithmic Sobolev trace inequalities and logarithmic Hardy trace inequalities on the upper half spaces. The best constants in these inequalities are explicitly computed in the radial case.
