Let {\bf R} denote any of the following classes: upper (lower) semi-Fredholm operators, Fredholm operators, upper (lower) semi-Weyl operators, Weyl operators, upper (lower) semi-Browder operators, Browder operators. For a bounded linear operator T on a Banach space X we prove that T=T_M\oplus T_N with T_M \in {\bf R} and T_N quasinilpotent (nilpotent) if and only if T admits a generalized Kato decomposition (T is of Kato type) and 0 is not an interior point of the corresponding spectrum \sigma_{\bf R}(T)=\{\lambda \in \mathbb{C}: T-\lambda \notin {\bf R}\}. In addition, we show that every non-isolated boundary point of the spectrum \sigma_{\bf R}(T) belongs to the generalized Kato spectrum of T.
