This note is based on a series of lectures delivered in Kyoto University. This note surveys the homogeneous Besov space \dot{B}^s_{pq} on {\mathbb R}^n with 1 \le p,q \le \infty and s \in {\mathbb R} in a rather self-contained manner. Possible extensions of this type of function spaces are breifly discussed in the end of this article. In particular, the fundamental properties are stated for the spaces \dot{B}^s_{pq} with 0<p,q \le \infty and s \in {\mathbb R} and \dot{F}^s_{pq} with 0<p<\infty, 0<q \le \infty and s \in {\mathbb R} as well as nonhomogeneous coupterparts B^s_{pq} with 0<p,q \le \infty and s \in {\mathbb R} and F^s_{pq} with 0<p<\infty, 0<q \le \infty and s \in {\mathbb R}.
