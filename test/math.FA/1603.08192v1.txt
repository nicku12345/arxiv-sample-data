Let A and (-\widetilde{A}) be dissipative operators on a Hilbert space \mathcal{H} and let (A,\widetilde{A}) form a dual pair, i.e. A\subset\widetilde{A}^*, resp.\ \widetilde{A}\subset A^*. We present a method of determining the proper dissipative extensions \widehat{A} of this dual pair, i.e. A\subset \widehat{A}\subset\widetilde{A}^* provided that \mathcal{D}(A)\cap\mathcal{D}(\widetilde{A}) is dense in \mathcal{H}.   Applications to symmetric operators, symmetric operators perturbed by a relatively bounded dissipative operator and more singular differential operators are discussed.   Finally, we investigate the stability of the numerical range of the different dissipative extensions.
