We study ideals \mathcal{I} on \mathbb{N} satisfying the following Baire-type property: if X is a complete metric space and \{X_{A} \colon A \in \mathcal{I} \} is a family of nowhere dense subsets of X with X_{A} \subset X_{B} whenever A \subset B, then \bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{I}}{X_{A}} \neq X. We give several characterizations and determine the ideals having this property among certain classes like analytic ideals and P-ideals. We also discuss similar covering properties when considering families of compact and meager subsets of X.
