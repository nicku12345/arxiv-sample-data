We show a way of constructing projectional skeletons using the concept of rich families in Banach spaces which admit a projectional generator. Our next result is that a Banach space X is Asplund and weakly compactly generated if and only if there exists a commutative 1-projectional skeleton (Q_\gamma:\ \gamma\in\Gamma) on X such that (Q_\gamma{}^*:\ \gamma\in\Gamma) is a commutative 1-projectional skeleton on X^*. We consider both, real and also complex, Banach spaces.
