We prove that the uniform growth bound \omega_0(\mathcal{U}) of a discrete evolution family \mathcal{U} of bounded linear operators acting on a complex Banach space X satisfies the inequality \omega_0(\mathcal{U})c_{\mathcal{U}}(\mathcal{X})\le -1; here c_{\mathcal{U}}(\mathcal{X}) is the operator norm of a convolution operator which acts on a certain Banach space \mathcal{X} of X-valued sequences.
