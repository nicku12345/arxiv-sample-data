Let \phi be an analytic map taking the unit disk \mathbb{D} into itself. We establish that the class of composition operators f \mapsto C_\phi(f) = f \circ \phi exhibits a rather strong rigidity of non-compact behaviour on the Hardy space H^p, for 1\le p < \infty and p \neq 2. Our main result is the following trichotomy, which states that exactly one of the following alternatives holds: (i) C_\phi is a compact operator H^p \to H^p, (ii) C_\phi fixes a (linearly isomorphic) copy of \ell^p in H^p, but C_\phi does not fix any copies of \ell^2 in H^p, (iii) C_\phi fixes a copy of \ell^2 in H^p. Moreover, in case (iii) the operator C_\phi actually fixes a copy of L^p(0,1) in H^p provided p > 1. We reinterpret these results in terms of norm-closed ideals of the bounded linear operators on H^p, which contain the compact operators \mathcal K(H^p). In particular, the class of composition operators on H^p does not reflect the quite complicated lattice structure of such ideals.
