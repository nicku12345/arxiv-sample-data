Let L^m_p(R^n), p\in [1,\infty], be the homogeneous Sobolev space, and let E\subset R^n be a closed set. For each p>n and each non-negative integer m we give an intrinsic characterization of the restrictions to E of m-jets generated by functions F\in L^{m+1}_p(R^n). Our trace criterion is expressed in terms of variations of corresponding Taylor remainders of m-jets evaluated on a certain family of "well separated" two point subsets of E. For p=\infty this result coincides with the classical Whitney-Glaeser extension theorem for m-jets.   Our approach is based on a representation of the Sobolev space L^{m+1}_p(R^n), p>n, as a union of C^{m,(d)}(R^n)-spaces where d belongs to a family of metrics on R^n with certain "nice" properties. Here C^{m,(d)}(R^n) is the space of C^m-functions on R^n whose partial derivatives of order m are Lipschitz functions with respect to d.   This enables us to show that, for every non-negative integer m and every p\in (n,\infty), the very same classical linear Whitney extension operator provides an almost optimal extension of m-jets generated by L^{m+1}_p-functions.
