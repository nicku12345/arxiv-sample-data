In the present paper we study unconditionally p-converging operators and Dunford-Pettis property of order p. New characterizations of unconditionally p-converging operators and Dunford-Pettis property of order p are established. Six quantities are defined to measure how far an operator is from being unconditionally p-converging. We prove quantitative versions of relationships of completely continuous operators,unconditionally p-converging operators and unconditionally converging operators. We further investigate possible quantifications of the Dunford-Pettis property of order p.
