We introduce the concepts of Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski's property (V) of order p and Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski's property (V^{*}) of order p. It is proved that, for each 1<p<\infty, the James p-space J_{p} enjoys Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski's property (V^{*}) of order p and the James p^{*}-space J_{p^{*}} (where p^{*} denotes the conjugate number of p) enjoys Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski's property (V) of order p. We prove that both L_{1}(\mu) (\mu a finite positive measure) and l_{1} enjoy the quantitative version of Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski's property (V^{*}).
