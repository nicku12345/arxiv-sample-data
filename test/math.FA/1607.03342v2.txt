The aim of this paper is to investigate asymmetric truncated Toeplitz operators with L^2 symbols between two different model spaces given by inner functions such that one divides the other. Characterizations of these operators are given in terms of rank two operators. A description of the class of symbols for which the corresponding asymmetric truncated Toeplitz operator is equal to the zero operator is also given.
