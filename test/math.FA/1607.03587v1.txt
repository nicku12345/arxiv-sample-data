In the first part of the paper we study the structure of Banach spaces with a conditional spreading basis. The geometry of such spaces exhibit a striking resemblance to the geometry of James' space. Further, we show that the averaging projections onto subspaces spanned by constant coefficient blocks with no gaps between supports are bounded. As a consequence, every Banach space with a spreading basis contains a complemented subspace with an unconditional basis. This gives an affirmative answer to a question of H. Rosenthal.   The second part contains two results on Banach spaces X whose asymptotic structures are closely related to c_0 and do not contain a copy of \ell_1: i) Suppose X has a normalized weakly null basis (x_i) and every spreading model (e_i) of a normalized weakly null block basis satisfies \|e_1-e_2\|=1. Then some subsequence of (x_i) is equivalent to the unit vector basis of c_0. This generalizes a similar theorem of Odell and Schlumprecht, and yields a new proof of the Elton-Odell theorem on the existence of infinite (1+\varepsilon)-separated sequences in the unit sphere of an arbitrary infinite dimensional Banach space. ii) Suppose that all asymptotic models of X generated by weakly null arrays are equivalent to the unit vector basis of c_0. Then X^* is separable and X is asymptotic-c_0 with respect to a shrinking basis (y_i) of Y\supseteq X.
