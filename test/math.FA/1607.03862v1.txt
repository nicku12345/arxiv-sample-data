In this note we study restrictions on the recently introduced super-additive and sub-additive transformations, A\mapsto A^* and A\mapsto A_*, of an aggregation function A. We prove that if A^* has a slightly stronger property of being strictly directionally convex, then A=A^* and A_* is linear; dually, if A_* is strictly directionally concave, then A=A_* and A^* is linear. This implies, for example, the existence of pairs of functions f\le g sub-additive and super-additive on [0,\infty[^n, respectively, with zero value at the origin and satisfying relatively mild extra conditions, for which there exists no aggregation function A on [0,\infty[^n such that A_*=f and A^*=g.
