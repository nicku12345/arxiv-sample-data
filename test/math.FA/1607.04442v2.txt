A new subspace of Morrey spaces whose elements can be approximated by infinitely differentiable compactly supported functions is introduced. Consequently, we give an explicit description of the closure of the set of such functions in Morrey spaces. A generalization of known embeddings of Morrey spaces into weighted Lesbesgue spaces is also obtained.
