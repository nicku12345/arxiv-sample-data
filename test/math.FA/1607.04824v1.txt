Let C_b^{k,\omega}(\mathbb R^n) be the Banach space of C^k functions on \mathbb R^n bounded together with all derivatives of order \le k and with derivatives of order k having moduli of continuity majorated by c\cdot\omega, c\in\mathbb R_+, for some \omega\in C(\mathbb R_+). Let C_b^{k,\omega}(S):=C_b^{k,\omega}(\mathbb R^n)|_S be the trace space to a closed subset S\subset\mathbb R^n. The geometric predual G_b^{k,\omega}(S) of C_b^{k,\omega}(S) is the minimal closed subspace of the dual \bigl(C_b^{k,\omega}(\mathbb R^n)\bigr)^* containing evaluation functionals of points in S. We study geometric properties of spaces G_b^{k,\omega}(S) and their relations to the classical Whitney problems on the characterization of trace spaces of C^k functions on \mathbb R^n.
