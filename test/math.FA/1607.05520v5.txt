We introduce bendlets, a shearlet-like system that is based on anisotropic scaling, translation, shearing, and bending of a compactly supported generator. With shearing being linear and bending quadratic in spatial coordinates, bendlets provide what we term a second-order shearlet system. As we show in this article, the decay rates of the associated transform enable the precise characterization of location, orientation and curvature of discontinuities in piecewise constant images. These results yield an improvement over existing directional representation systems where curvature only controls the constant of the decay rate of the transform. We also detail the construction of shearlet systems of arbitrary order. A practical implementation of bendlets is provided as an extension of the ShearLab toolbox, which we use to verify our theoretical classification results.
