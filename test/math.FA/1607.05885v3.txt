We provide an intrinsic atomic characterization for 2-microlocal Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces with variable integrability on domains, B_{\p,\q}^{\bm{w}}(\Omega) and F_{\p,\q}^{\bm{w}}(\Omega), where \Omega is a regular domain. We use the already known decomposition with non-smooth atoms for the spaces B_{\p,\q}^{\bm{w}}(\rn) and F_{\p,\q}^{\bm{w}}(\rn) in order to get the main result.
