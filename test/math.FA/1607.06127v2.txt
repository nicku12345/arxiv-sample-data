In this paper, we study nonlinear embeddings between Banach spaces. More specifically, the goal of this paper is to study weaker versions of coarse and uniform embeddability, and to provide suggestive evidences that those weaker embeddings may be stronger than one would think. We do such by proving that many known results for coarse and uniform embeddings remain valid for those weaker notions of embeddings.
