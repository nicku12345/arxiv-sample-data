The possibility of getting a Radon-Nikodym type theorem and a Lebesgue-like decomposition for a non necessarily positive sesquilinear \Omega form defined on a vector space \mathcal D, with respect to a given positive form \Theta defined on \D, is explored. The main result consists in showing that a sesquilinear form \Omega is \Theta-regular, in the sense that it has a Radon-Nikodym type representation, if and only if it satisfies a sort Cauchy-Schwarz inequality whose right hand side is implemented by a positive sesquilinear form which is \Theta-absolutely continuous. In the particular case where \Theta is an inner product in \mathcal D, this class of sesquilinear form covers all standard examples. In the case of a form defined on a dense subspace \mathcal D of Hilbert space \mathcal H we give a sufficient condition for the equality \Omega(\xi,\eta)=\langle{T\xi}|{\eta}\rangle, with T a closable operator, to hold on a dense subspace of \mathcal H.
