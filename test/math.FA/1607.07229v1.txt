We study positive transfer operators R in the setting of general measure spaces \left(X,\mathscr{B}\right). For each R, we compute associated path-space probability spaces \left(\Omega,\mathbb{P}\right). When the transfer operator R is compatible with an endomorphism in \left(X,\mathscr{B}\right), we get associated multiresolutions for the Hilbert spaces L^{2}\left(\Omega,\mathbb{P}\right) where the path-space \Omega may then be taken to be a solenoid. Our multiresolutions include both orthogonality relations and self-similarity algorithms for standard wavelets and for generalized wavelet-resolutions. Applications are given to topological dynamics, ergodic theory, and spectral theory, in general; to iterated function systems (IFSs), and to Markov chains in particular.
