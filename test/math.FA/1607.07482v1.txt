We find necessary and sufficient conditions on a family \mathcal{R} = (r_i)_{i \in I} in a Boolean algebra \mathcal{B} under which there exists a unique positive probability measure \mu on \mathcal{B} such that \mu ( \bigcap_{k=1}^n \theta_k r_{i_k} ) = 2^{-n} for all finite collections of distinct indices i_1, \ldots, i_n \in I and all collections of signs \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n \in \{-1,1\}, where the product \theta x of a sign \theta by an element x \in \mathcal{B} is defined by setting 1 x = x and -1 x = - x = \mathbf{1} \setminus x. Such a family we call a complete Rademacher family. We prove that Dedekind \sigma-complete Boolean algebras admitting complete Rademacher systems of the same cardinality are isomorphic. As a consequence, we obtain that a Dedekind \sigma-complete Boolean algebra is homogeneous measurable if and only if it admits a complete Rademacher family. This new way to define a measure on a Boolean algebra allows us to define classical systems on an arbitrary Riesz space, such as Rademacher and Haar. We define a complete Rademacher system of any cardinality and a countable complete Haar system on an element e > 0 of a vector lattice E in such a way that if e is an order unit of E then the corresponding systems become complete for the entire E. We prove that if E is Dedekind complete then any complete Haar system on e is an order Schauder basis for the ideal A_e generated by e. Finally, we develop a theory of integration in a Riesz space of elements of the band B_e generated by a fixed e > 0 with respect to the measure on the Boolean algebra \mathfrak{F}_e of fragments of e generated by a complete Rademacher family on \mathfrak{F}_e. Much space is devoted to examples showing that our way of thinking is sharp (e.g., we show the essentiality of each of the condition in the definition of a Rademacher family).
