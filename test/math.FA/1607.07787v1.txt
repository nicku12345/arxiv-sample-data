We collect several open questions in Banach spaces, mostly related to measure theoretic aspects of the theory. The problems are divided into five categories: miscellaneous problems in Banach spaces (non-separable L^p spaces, compactness in Banach spaces, w^*-null sequences in dual spaces), measurability in Banach spaces (Baire and Borel \sigma-algebras, measurable selectors), vector integration (Riemann, Pettis and McShane integrals), vector measures (range and associated L^1 spaces) and Lebesgue-Bochner spaces (topological and structural properties, scalar convergence).
