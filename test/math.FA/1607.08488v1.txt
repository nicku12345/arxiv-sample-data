In this paper we characterize Birkhoff-James orthogonality of linear operators defined on a finite dimensional real Banach space  \mathbb{X}.  We also explore the symmetry of Birkhoff-James orthogonality of linear operators defined on  \mathbb{X}.  Using some of the related results proved in this paper, we finally prove that  T \in \mathbb{L}(l_{p}^2) (p \geq 2, p \neq \infty)  is left symmetric with respect to Birkhoff-James orthogonality if and only if  T  is the zero operator. We conjecture that the result holds for any finite dimensional strictly convex and smooth real Banach space  \mathbb{X},  in particular for the Banach spaces  l_{p}^{n} (p > 1, p \neq \infty).
