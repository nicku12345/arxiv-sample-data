Given a non-negative weight v, not necessarily bounded or strictly positive, defined on a domain G in the complex plane, we consider the weighted space H_v^\infty(G) of all holomorphic functions on G such that the product v|f| is bounded in G and study the question of when is such a space complete under the canonical sup-seminorm. We obtain both some necessary and some sufficient conditions in terms of the weight v, exhibit several relevant examples, and characterize completeness in the case of spaces with radial weights on balanced domains.
