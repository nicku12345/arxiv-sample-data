Let d\geq 1 be a natural number and A_0 be a d\times d expansive integral matrix with determinant \pm 2. Then A_0 is integrally similar to an integral matrix A with certain additional properties. A finite solution to the system of equations associated with the matrix A will result in an iterated sequence \{\Psi^k \chi_{[0,1)^d}\} that converges to a function \varphi_A in L^2(\R^d)-norm. With this (scaling) function \varphi_A, we will construct the Parseval's wavelet function \psi with compact support associated with matrix A_0.
