If T is a bounded linear operator acting on an infinite-dimensional Banach space X, we say that a closed subspace Y of X of both infinite dimension and codimension is an almost-invariant halfspace (AIHS) under T whenever TY\subseteq Y+E for some finite-dimensional subspace E, or, equivalently, (T+F)Y\subseteq Y for some finite-rank perturbation F:X\to X. We discuss the existence of AIHS's for various restrictions on E and F when X is a complex Banach space. We also extend some of these and other results in the literature to the setting where X is a real Banach space instead of a complex one.
