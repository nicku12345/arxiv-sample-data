In this article, we prove that if the Fourier transform of a certain integrable function on the Euclidean motion group is of finite rank, then the function has to vanish identically. Further, we explore a new variance of the uncertainty principle, the Heisenberg uniqueness pairs on the Euclidean motion group as well as on the product group \mathbb R^n\times K, where K is a compact group.
