Extending M.\ Daws' definition of ultra-amenable Banach algebras, we introduce the notion of operator ultra-amenability for completely contractive Banach algebras. For a locally compact group G, we show that the operator ultra-amenability of A(G) imposes severe restrictions on G. In particular, it forces G to be a discrete, amenable group with no infinite abelian subgroups. For various classes of such groups, this means that G is finite.
