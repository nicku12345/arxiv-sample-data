Let {\mathcal B}(H) denote the Banach algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space H with \dim H\geq 3, and let \mathcal A and \mathcal B be subsets of {\mathcal B}(H) which contain all rank one operators. Suppose F(\cdot ) is a unitary invariant norm, the pseudo spectra, the pseudo spectral radius, the C-numerical range, or the C-numerical radius for some finite rank operator C. The structure is determined for surjective maps \Phi :{\mathcal A}\rightarrow \mathcal B satisfying F(A^*B)=F(\Phi (A)^*\Phi (B)) for all A, B \in {\mathcal A}. To establish the proofs, some general results are obtained for functions F:{\mathcal F}_1(H) \cup \{0\} \rightarrow [0, +\infty), where {\mathcal F}_1(H) is the set of rank one operators in {\mathcal B}(H), satisfying (a) F(\mu UAU^*)=F(A) for a complex unit \mu, A\in {\mathcal F}_1(H) and unitary U \in {\mathcal B}(H) (b) for any rank one operator X\in {\mathcal F}_1(H) the map t\mapsto F(tX) on [0, \infty) is strictly increasing, and (c) the set \{F(X): X \in {\mathcal F}_1(H) \hbox{ and } \|X\| = 1\} attains its maximum and minimum.
