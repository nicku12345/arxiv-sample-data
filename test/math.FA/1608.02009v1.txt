Given a quasiconformal mapping f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^n with n\ge2, we show that (un-)boundedness of the composition operator {\bf C}_f on the spaces Q_{\alpha}(\mathbb R^n) depends on the index \alpha and the degeneracy set of the Jacobian J_f. We establish sharp results in terms of the index \alpha and the local/global self-similar Minkowski dimension of the degeneracy set of J_f. This gives a solution to [Problem 8.4, 3] and also reveals a completely new phenomenon, which is totally different from the known results for Sobolev, BMO, Triebel-Lizorkin and Besov spaces. Consequently, Tukia-V\"ais\"al\"a's quasiconformal extension f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^n of an arbitrary quasisymmetric mapping g:\mathbb R^{n-p}\to \mathbb R^{n-p} is shown to preserve Q_{\alpha} (\mathbb R^n) for any (\alpha,p)\in (0,1)\times[2,n)\cup(0,1/2)\times\{1\}. Moreover, Q_{\alpha}(\mathbb R^n) is shown to be invariant under inversions for all 0<\alpha<1.
