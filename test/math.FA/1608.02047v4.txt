A logarithm representation of operators is introduced as well as a concept of pre-infinitesimal generator. Generators of invertible evolution families are represented by the logarithm representation, and a set of operators represented by the logarithm is shown to be associated with analytic semigroups. Consequently generally-unbounded infinitesimal generators of invertible evolution families are characterized by a convergent power series representation.
