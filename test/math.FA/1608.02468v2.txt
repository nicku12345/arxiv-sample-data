Solving a well-known problem of Maharam, Talagrand [17] constructed an exhaustive non uniformly exhaustive submeasure, thus also providing the first example of a Maharam algebra that is not a measure algebra. To each exhaustive submeasure one can canonically assign a certain countable ordinal, its exhaustivity rank. In this paper, we use carefully constructed Schreier families and norms derived from them to provide examples of exhaustive submeasures of arbitrary high exhaustivity rank. This gives rise to uncountably many non isomorphic separable atomless Maharam algebras.
