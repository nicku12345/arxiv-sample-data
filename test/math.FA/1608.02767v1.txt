Given a discrete group and a unitary representation on a Hilbert space \mathcal{H}, we prove that the notions of operator Bracket map and Gramian coincide on a dense set of \mathcal{H}. As a consequence, combining this result with known frame theory, we can recover in a simple way all previous Bracket characterizations of Riesz and frame sequences generated by a single element under a unitary representation.
