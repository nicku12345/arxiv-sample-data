We calculate in this paper the norm of composition, multiplicative and product operator, generated by multiplicative and measurable argument transformation between two different ordinary Lebesgue-Riesz and Grand Lebesgue spaces.   We set ourselves the aim to obtain the exact expression for the norm of the considered operators by means of building of appropriate examples.
