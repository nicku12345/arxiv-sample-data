We prove the optimal estimate between the Szlenk and w^*-dentability indices of an arbitrary w^*-compact subset of the dual of a Banach space. For a given w^*-compact, convex subset K of the dual of a Banach space, we introduce a two player game the winning strategies of which determine the Szlenk index of K. We give applications to the w^*-dentability index of a Banach space and of an operator.
