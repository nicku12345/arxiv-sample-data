Homogeneous mixed-norm Triebel--Lizorkin spaces are introduced and studied with the use of a discrete wavelet transformation, the so-called \varphi-transform. This extends the classical \varphi-transform approach introduced by Frazier and Jawerth to the setting of mixed-norm spaces. Moreover, the theory of the \varphi-transform is enhanced through a precise definition of the synthesis operator, in terms of a Pettis integral, and a number of rigorous results for this operator. Especially its terms can always be summed in any order, without changing the resulting distribution.
