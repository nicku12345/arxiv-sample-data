We study functions f : (a,b) ---> R on open intervals in R with respect to various kinds of positive and negative definiteness conditions. We say that f is positive definite if the kernel f((x + y)/2) is positive definite. We call f negative definite if, for every h > 0, the function e^{-hf} is positive definite. Our first main result is a L\'evy--Khintchine formula (an integral representation) for negative definite functions on arbitrary intervals. For (a,b) = (0,\infty) it generalizes classical results by Bernstein and Horn.   On a symmetric interval (-a,a), we call f reflection positive if it is positive definite and, in addition, the kernel f((x - y)/2) is positive definite. We likewise define reflection negative functions and obtain a L\'evy--Khintchine formula for reflection negative functions on all of R. Finally, we obtain a characterization of germs of reflection negative functions on 0-neighborhoods in R.
