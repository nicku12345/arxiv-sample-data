Recent work has demonstrated that Clark's theory of unitary perturbations of the backward shift restricted to a deBranges-Rovnyak subspace of Hardy space on the disk has a natural extension to the several variable setting. In the several variable case, the appropriate generalization of the Schur class of contractive analytic functions is the closed unit ball of the Drury-Arveson multiplier algebra and the Aleksandrov-Clark measures are necessarily promoted to positive linear functionals on a symmetrized subsystem of the Cuntz-Toeplitz operator system A + A*, where A is the non-commutative disk algebra. We continue this program for vector-valued Drury-Arveson space by establishing the existence of a canonical `tight' extension of any Aleksandrov-Clark map to the full Cuntz-Toeplitz operator system. We apply this tight extension to generalize several earlier results and we characterize all extensions of the Aleksandrov-Clark maps.
