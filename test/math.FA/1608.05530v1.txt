Let A and X be Banach algebras and let X be an algebraic Banach A-module. Then the \ell^1-direct sum A\times X equipped with the multiplication (a,x)(b,y)=(ab, ay+xb+xy)\quad (a,b\in A, x,y\in X) is a Banach algebra, denoted by A\bowtie X, which will be called "\textit{a generalized module extension Banach algebra}". Module extension algebras, Lau product and also the direct sum of Banach algebras are the main examples satisfying this framework. We characterize the structure of n-dual valued (n\in\mathbb N)) derivations on A\bowtie X from which we investigate the n-weak amenability for the algebra A\bowtie X. We apply the results and the techniques of proofs for presenting some older results with simple direct proofs.
