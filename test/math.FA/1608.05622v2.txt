Let A be an operator on {a separable } Hilbert space \cH, and let G \subset \cH. It is known that - under appropriate conditions on A and G - the set of iterations F_G(A)= \{A^j \gbf \; | \; \gbf \in G, \; 0 \leq j \leq L(\gbf) \}  is a frame for \cH. We call F_G(A) a dynamical frame for \cH, and explore further its properties; in particular, we show that the canonical dual frame of F_G(A) also has an iterative set structure.   We explore the relations between the operator A, the set G and the number of iterations L which ensure that the system F_G(A) is a scalable frame. We give a general statement on frame scalability, We and study in detail the case when A is a normal operator, utilizing the unitary diagonalization in finite dimensions. In addition, we answer the question of when F_G(A) is a scalable frame in several special cases involving block-diagonal and companion operators.
