Let E be a complete uniform topological algebra with Arens-Michael normed factors \left(E_{\alpha}\right)_{\alpha\in\Lambda}. Then M\left(E\right) \cong \varprojlim M\left(E_{\alpha}\right) within an algebra isomorphism \varphi. If each factor E_{\alpha} is complete, then every multiplier of E is continuous and \varphi is a topological algebra isomorphism where M\left(E\right) is endowed with its seminorm topology.
