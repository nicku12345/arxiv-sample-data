For a tuple A=(A_1,\ A_2,\ ...,\ A_n) of elements in a unital Banach algebra {\mathcal B}, its projective joint spectrum P(A) is the collection of z\in {\mathbb C}^n such that A(z)=z_1A_1+z_2A_2+\cdots +z_nA_n is not invertible. It is known that the {\mathcal B}-valued 1-form \omega_A(z)=A^{-1}(z)dA(z) contains much topological information about the joint resolvent set P^c(A). This paper studies geometric properties of P^c(A) with respect to Hermitian metrics defined through the {\mathcal B}-valued {\em fundamental form} \Omega_A=-\omega^*_A\wedge \omega_A and its coupling with faithful states \phi on {\mathcal B}, i.e. \phi(\Omega_A). The connection between the tuple A and the metric is the main subject of this paper. In particular, it shows that the K\"{a}hlerness of the metric is tied with the commutativity of the tuple, and its completeness is related to the Fuglede-Kadison determinant.
