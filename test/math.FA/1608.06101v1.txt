Let A\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N} and \mathrm{SO}_n:=\{ U \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}:UU^t=I_n,\det U>0\} be the set of n\times n special orthogonal matrices. Define the (real) special orthogonal orbit of A by \[ O(A):=\{UAV:U,V\in\mathrm{SO}_n\}. \] In this paper, we show that the linear image of O(A) is star-shaped with respect to the origin for arbitrary linear maps L:\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}\to\mathbb{R}^\ell if n\geq 2^{\ell-1}. In particular, for linear maps L:\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}\to\mathbb{R}^2 and when A has distinct singular values, we study B\in O(A) such that L(B) is a boundary point of L(O(A)). This gives an alternative proof of a result by Li and Tam on the convexity of L(O(A)) for linear maps L:\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}\to\mathbb{R}^2.
