The main result of this paper is a proof that for any integrable function f on the torus, any sequence of its orthogonal projections (\widetilde{P}_n f) onto periodic spline spaces with arbitrary knots \widetilde{\Delta}_n and arbitrary polynomial degree converges to f almost everywhere with respect to the Lebesgue measure, provided the mesh diameter |\widetilde{\Delta}_n| tends to zero. We also give a proof of the fact that the operators \widetilde{P}_n are bounded on L^\infty independently of the knots \widetilde{\Delta}_n.
