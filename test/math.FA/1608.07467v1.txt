In this paper, we extend the notions of statistically convergence of order \beta  and strong Ces\`{a}ro summability of order \beta , and introduce the notions f-statistically convergence of order \beta  and strong Ces\`{a}ro summability of order \beta  for \beta \in \left( 0,1\right]  with respect to an unbounded modulus function f for sequences of fuzzy numbers and give some inclusion theorems.
