We investigate possible quantifications of strictly singular operators, l_{p}-strictly singular operators, c_{0}-strictly singular operators, strictly cosingular operators, l_{p}-strictly cosingular operators. We prove quantitative, even strengthening versions of well-known results about relationships of these five classes of operators and compact, weakly compact, unconditionally converging operators.
