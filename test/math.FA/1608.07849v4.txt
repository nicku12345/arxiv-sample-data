We extend the construction of Garsia-Rodemich spaces in different directions. We show that the new space \textbf{B,} introduced by Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu \cite{bbm}, can be described via a suitable scaling of the Garsia-Rodemich norms. As an application we give a new proof of the embeddings BMO\subset \textbf{B }\subset L(n^{\prime},\infty). We then generalize the Garsia-Rodemich construction and introduce the GaRo_{X} spaces associated with a rearrangement invariant space X, in such a way that GaRo_{X}=X, for a large class of rearrangement invariant spaces. The underlying inequality for this new characterization of rearrangement invariant spaces is an extension of the rearrangement inequalities of \cite{milbmo}. We introduce Gagliardo seminorms adapted to rearrangement invariant spaces and use our generalized Garsia-Rodemich construction to prove Fractional Sobolev inequalities in this context.
