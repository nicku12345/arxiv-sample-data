In this work, we study the volume ratio of the projective tensor products \ell^n_p\otimes_{\pi}\ell_q^n\otimes_{\pi}\ell_r^n with 1\leq p\leq q \leq r \leq \infty. We obtain asymptotic formulas that are sharp in almost all cases. As a consequence of our estimates, these spaces allow for a nearly Euclidean decomposition of Kashin type whenever 1\leq p \leq q\leq r \leq 2 or 1\leq p \leq 2 \leq r \leq \infty and q=2. Also, from the Bourgain-Milman bound on the volume ratio of Banach spaces in terms of their cotype 2 constant, we obtain information on the cotype of these 3-fold projective tensor products. Our results naturally generalize to k-fold products \ell_{p_1}^n\otimes_{\pi}\dots \otimes_{\pi}\ell_{p_k}^n with k\in\mathbb N and 1\leq p_1 \leq \dots\leq p_k \leq \infty.
