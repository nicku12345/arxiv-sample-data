A Fenchel-Moreau type duality for proper convex and lower semi-continuous functions f\colon X\to \overline{L^0} is established where (X,Y,\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle) is a dual pair of Banach spaces and \overline{L^0} is the set of all extended real-valued measurable functions. We provide a concept of lower semi-continuity which is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a dual representation in terms of elements in the Bochner space L^0(Y). To derive the duality result, several conditional completions and extensions are constructed.   This is an earlier version of arXiv e-print 1708.03127, where the main results were formulated in an abstract setting of conditional completions, conditional extensions and conditional real numbers.
