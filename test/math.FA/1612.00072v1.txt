In the paper we prove several inequalities involving two isotonic linear functionals. We consider inequalities for functions with variable bounds, for Lipschitz and H\" older type functions etc. These results give us an elegant method for obtaining a number of inequalities for various kinds of fractional integral operators such as for the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral operator, the Hadamard fractional integral operator, fractional hyperqeometric integral and corresponding q-integrals.
