In this paper we characterize \sqrt{2}-1-uniform J-Parseval fusion frames in a Krein space \mathbb{K}. We provide a few results regarding construction of new J-tight fusion frame from given J-tight fusion frames. We also characterize any uniformly J-definite subspace of a Krein space \mathbb{K} in terms of a J-fusion frame inequality. Finally we generalize the fundamental identity of frames in Krein space J-fusion frame setting.
