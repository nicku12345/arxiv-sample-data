Let I_{\alpha} be the bilinear fractional integral operator, B_{\alpha} be a more singular family of bilinear fractional integral operators and \vec{b}=(b,b). B\'{e}nyi et al. in \cite{B1} showed that if b\in {\rm CMO}, the {\rm BMO}-closure of C^{\infty}_{c}(\mathbb{R}^n), the commutator [b,B_{\alpha}]_{i}(i=1,2) is a separately compact operator. In this paper, it is proved that b\in {\rm CMO} is necessary for [b,B_{\alpha}]_{i}(i=1,2) is a compact operator. Also, the authors characterize the compactness of the {\bf iterated} commutator [\Pi\vec{b},I_{\alpha}] of bilinear fractional integral operator. More precisely, the commutator [\Pi\vec{b},I_{\alpha}] is a compact operator if and only if b\in {\rm CMO}.
