By generalizing a construction of Garling, for each 1\leqslant p<\infty and each normalized, nonincreasing sequence of positive numbers w\in c_0\setminus\ell_1 we exhibit an \ell_p-saturated, complementably homogeneous Banach space g(w,p) related to the Lorentz sequence space d(w,p). Using methods originally developed for studying d(w,p), we show that g(w,p) admits a unique (up to equivalence) subsymmetric basis, although when w=(n^{-\theta})_{n=1}^\infty for some 0<\theta<1, it does not admit a symmetric basis. We then discuss some additional properties of g(w,p) related to uniform convexity and superreflexivity.
