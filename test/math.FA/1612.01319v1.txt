We introduce a one-parameter family of transforms, U^t_{(m)}, t>0, from the Hilbert space of Clifford algebra valued square integrable functions on the m--dimensional sphere, L^2(S^{m},d\sigma_{m})\otimes \mathbb{C}_{m+1}, to the Hilbert spaces, {\mathcal M}L^2(\mathbb{R}^{m+1} \setminus \{0\},d\mu_t), of monogenic functions on \mathbb{R}^{m+1}\setminus \{0\} which are square integrable with respect to appropriate measures, d\mu_t. We prove that these transforms are unitary isomorphisms of the Hilbert spaces and are extensions of the Segal-Bargman coherent state transform, U_{(1)} : L^2(S^{1},d\sigma_{1}) \longrightarrow {\mathcal H}L^2({\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}},d\mu), to higher dimensional spheres in the context of Clifford analysis. In Clifford analysis it is natural to replace the analytic continuation from S^m to S^m_{\mathbb{C}} as in \cite{Ha1, St, HM} by the Cauchy--Kowalewski extension from S^m to \mathbb{R}^{m+1}\setminus \{0\}. One then obtains a unitary isomorphism from an L^2--Hilbert space to an Hilbert space of solutions of the Dirac equation, that is to a Hilbert space of monogenic functions.
