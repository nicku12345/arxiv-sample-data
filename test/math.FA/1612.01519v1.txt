The \Lambda-sequence spaces \Lambda_p for 1< p\leq\infty and its generalization \Lambda_{\hat{p}} for 1<\hat{p}<\infty, \hat{p}=(p_n) is introduced. The James constants and strong n-th James constants of \Lambda_p for 1<p\leq\infty is determined. It is proved that generalized \Lambda-sequence space \Lambda_{\hat{p}} is embedded isometrically in the Nakano sequence space l_{\hat{p}}(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}) of finite dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{n+1}. Hence it follows that sequence spaces \Lambda_p and \Lambda_{\hat{p}} possesses the uniform Opial property, property (\beta) of Rolewicz and weak uniform normal structure. Moreover, it is established that \Lambda_{\hat{p}} possesses the coordinate wise uniform Kadec-Klee property. Further necessary and sufficient conditions for element x\in S(\Lambda_{\hat{p}}) to be an extreme point of B(\Lambda_{\hat{p}}) are derived. Finally, estimation of von Neumann-Jordan and James constants of two dimensional \Lambda-sequence space \Lambda_2^{(2)} is being carried out.
