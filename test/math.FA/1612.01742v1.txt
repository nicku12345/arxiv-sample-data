Let \mathcal{P}_{K} (^{n}E; F) (resp. \mathcal{P}_{w} (^{n}E; F)) the subspace of all P\in \mathcal{P}(^{n}E; F) which are compact (resp. weakly continuous on bounded sets). We show that if \mathcal{P}_{K} (^{n}E; F) contains an isomorphic copy of c_{0}, then \mathcal{P}_{K} (^{n}E; F) is not complemented in \mathcal{P}(^{n}E; F). Likewise we show that if \mathcal{P}_{w} (^{n}E; F) contains an isomorphic copy of c_{0}, then \mathcal{P}_{w}(^{n}E; F) is not complemented in \mathcal{P}(^{n}E; F).
