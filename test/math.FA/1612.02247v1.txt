Let U_{FNA} be the class of all non-archimedean finite-dimensional Banach spaces. A non-archimedean Gurarii Banach space G over a non-archimedean valued field K is constructed, i.e. a non-archimedean Banach space G of countable type which is of almost universal disposition for the class U_{FNA}. This means: for every isometry g : X \to Y , where Y \in U_{FNA} and X is a subspace of G, and every \varepsilon \in (0,1) there exists an \varepsilon-isometry f : Y \to G such that f(g(x)) = x for all x \in X. We show that all non-archimedean Banach spaces of almost universal disposition for the class U_{FNA} are \varepsilon-isometric. Furthermore, all non-archimedean Banach spaces of almost universal disposition for the class U_{FNA} are isometrically isomorphic if and only if K is spherically complete and \{|\lambda| : \lambda \in K \setminus \{0\} \} = (0,\infty).
