In this paper, we discuss quasidense multifunctions from a Banach space into its dual, and use the two sum theorems proved in a previous paper to give various characterizations of quasidensity. We investigate the Fitzpatrick extension of such a multifunction. We prove that, for closed monotone multifunctions, quasidensity implies type (FPV) and strong maximality, and that quasidensity is equivalent to type (FP). This version differs from Version 3 in that a few minor errors have been corrected.
