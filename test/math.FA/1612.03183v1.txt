We consider the family of integral operators (K_{\alpha}f)(x) from L^p[0,1] to L^q[0,1] given by (K_{\alpha}f)(x)=\int_0^1(1-xy)^{\alpha -1}\,f(y)\,\operatorname{d}\!y, \qquad 0<\alpha<1. The main objective is to find upper bounds for the Kolmogorov widths, where the nth Kolmogorov width is the infimum of the deviation of (K_{\alpha}f) from an n-dimensional subspaces of L^p[0,1] (with the infimum taken over all n-dimensional subspaces), and is therefore a measure of how well K_{\alpha} can be approximated. We find upper bounds for the Kolmogorov widths in question that decrease faster than \exp(-\kappa \sqrt{n}) for some positive constant \kappa.
