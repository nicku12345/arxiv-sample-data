We study the properties of the Volterra and Ces\`aro operators viewed on the L^1-M\"untz space M_\Lambda^1 with range in the space of continuous functions. These operators are neither compact nor weakly compact. We estimate how far from being (weakly) compact they are by computing their (generalized) essential norm. It turns out that this latter does not depend on \Lambda and is equal to 1/2.
