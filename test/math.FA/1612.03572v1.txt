For a symmetric convex body K\subset\mathbb{R}^n, the Dvoretzky dimension k(K) is the largest dimension for which a random central section of K is almost spherical. A Dvoretzky-type theorem proved by V.~D.~Milman in 1971 provides a lower bound for k(K) in terms of the average M(K) and the maximum b(K) of the norm generated by K over the Euclidean unit sphere. Later, V.~D.~Milman and G. Schechtman obtained a matching upper bound for k(K) in the case when \frac{M(K)}{b(K)}>c(\frac{\log(n)}{n})^{\frac{1}{2}}.   In this paper, we will give an elementary proof of the upper bound in Milman-Schechtman theorem which does not require any restriction on M(K) and b(K).
