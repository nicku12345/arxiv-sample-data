If f is a symmetric complex-valued function on the m-fold Cartesian product of the set of non-negative reals and A is a positive semi-definite m\times m matrix with eigenvalues \lambda_j, we set f(A):=f(\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_m). It is shown that if [f(A_{\alpha\beta})] is positive semi-definite whenever [A_{\alpha\beta}] is a positive semi-definite matrix with positive semi-definite entries A_{\alpha\beta}, then f has a power series expansion with positive coefficients.
