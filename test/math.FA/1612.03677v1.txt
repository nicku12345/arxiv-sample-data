In this paper, it was obtained the new matrix domain with the well known classical sequence spaces and an infinite matrix. The Taylor method which known then as the circle method of order r (0 < r < 1), as an infinite matrix for the matrix domain is used. Newly constructed space is isomorphic copy of the spaces of all absolutely p-summable sequences. It is well known that Hilbert space have the nicest geometric properties. Then, it is proved that the new space is a Hilbert space for p = 2. Further, it was computed dual spaces and characterized some matrix classes of the new Taylor space in the table form. Section 3 is devoted some geometric properties of Taylor space.
