Let m,p,q\in(0,\infty) and let u,v,w be nonnegative weights. We characterize validity of the inequality   \[   \left(\int_0^\infty w(t) (f^*(t))^q \, dt \right)^\frac 1q \le C \left(\int_0^\infty v(t) \left(\int_t^\infty u(s) (f^*(s))^m \,ds \right)^\frac pm \! dt \right)^\frac 1p   \] for all measurable functions f defined on \mathbb{R}^n and provide equivalent estimates of the optimal constant C>0 in terms of the weights and exponents. The obtained conditions characterize the embedding of the Copson-Lorentz space CL^{m,p}(u,v), generated by the functional   \[   \|f\|_{{CL^{m,p}(u,v)}} := \left(\int_0^\infty v(t) \left(\int_t^\infty u(s) (f^*(s))^m \,ds \right)^\frac pm \! dt \right)^\frac 1p,   \] into the Lorentz space \Lambda^q(w). Moreover, the results are applied to describe the associated space of the Copson-Lorentz space {CL^{m,p}(u,v)} for the full range of exponents m,p\in(0,\infty).
