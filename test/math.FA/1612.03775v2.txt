Angular equivalence is introduced and shown to be an equivalence relation among the norms on a fixed real vector space. It is a finer notion than the usual (topological) notion of norm equivalence. Angularly equivalent norms share certain geometric properties: A norm that is angularly equivalent to a uniformly convex norm is itself uniformly convex. The same is true for strict convexity. Extreme points of the unit balls of angularly equivalent norms occur on the same rays, and if one unit ball is a polyhedron so is the other.   Among norms arising from inner products, two norms are angularly equivalent if and only if they are topological equivalent. But, unlike topological equivalence, angular equivalence is able to distinguish between different norms on a finite-dimensional space. In particular, no two \ell^p norms on \mathbb R^n are angularly equivalent.
