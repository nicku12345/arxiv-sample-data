We study a semigroup of weighted composition operators on the Hardy space of the disk H^2(\mathbb{D}), and more generally on the Hardy space H^2(U) attached to a simply connected domain U with smooth boundary. Motivated by conformal field theory, we establish bounds on the singular values (approximation numbers) of these weighted composition operators. As a byproduct we obtain estimates on the singular values of the restriction operator (embedding operator) H^2(V) \to H^2(U) when U \subset V and the boundary of U touches that of V. Moreover, using the connection between the weighted composition operators and restriction operators, we show that these operators exhibit an analog of the Fisher-Micchelli phenomenon for non-compact operators.
