The paper deals with singular Sturm-Liouville expressions with matrix-valued distributional coefficients. Due to a suitable regularization, the corresponding operators are correctly defined as quasi-differentials. Their resolvent convergence is investigated and all self-adjoint, maximal dissipative, and maximal accumulative extensions are described in terms of homogeneous boundary conditions of the canonical form.
