The purpose of this article is to prove a generalisation of the Besicovitch-Federer projection theorem about a characterisation of rectifiable and unrectifiable sets in terms of their projections. For an m-unrectifiable set \Sigma\subset\mathbb{R}^n having finite Hausdorff measure and \varepsilon>0, we prove that for a mapping f\in\mathcal{C}^1(U,\mathbb{R}^n) having constant, equal to m, rank of the Jacobian matrix there exists a mapping f_\varepsilon whose rank of the Jacobian matrix is also constant, equal to m, such that \|f_\varepsilon-f\|_{\mathcal{C}^1}<\varepsilon and \mathcal{H}^m(f_\varepsilon(\Sigma))=0. We derive it as a consequence of the Besicovitch-Federer theorem stating that the \mathcal{H}^m measure of a generic projection of an m-unrectifiable set \Sigma onto an m-dimensional plane is equal to zero.
