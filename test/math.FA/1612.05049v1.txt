Let E be a Frechet-Montel space and (E_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} be a finite dimensional unconditional decomposition of E with \dim(E_n)\leq k for some fixed k \in \mathbb{N} and for all n \in \mathbb{N}. Consider a sequence (x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} formed by taking an element x_n from each E_n for all n \in \mathbb{N}. Then (x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} has a subsequence which is complemented in E
