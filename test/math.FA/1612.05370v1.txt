Let \mu \in {\cal E}'({\mathbb R}^n) be a compactly supported distribution such that its support is a convex set with non-empty interior. Let X_2 be a convex domain in {\mathbb R}^n, X_1 = X_2 + supp \ \mu . Assuming that a convolution operator A: {\cal E}(X_1) \to {\cal E}(X_2) acting by the rule (Af)(x) = (\mu * f)(x) is surjective we provide a condition on a linear continuous operator B: {\cal E}(X_1) \to {\cal E}(X_2) that guarantees surjectivity of the operator A+B.
