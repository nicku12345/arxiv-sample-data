The main aim of the paper is to prove a fountain theorem without assuming the \tau-upper semicontinuity condition on the variational functional. Using this improved fountain theorem, we may deal with more general strongly indefinite elliptic problems with various sign-changing nonlinear terms. As an application, we obtain infinitely many solutions for a semilinear Schr\"odinger equation with strongly indefinite structure and sign-changing nonlinearity.
