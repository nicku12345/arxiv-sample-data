Nonstandard hulls of a vector lattice were introduced and studied in \cite{E10,E9,E7,E5,E3}. In recent paper \cite{EG}, these notions were extended to ordered vector spaces. In the present paper, following the construction of associated Banach-Kantorovich space \cite{E8}, we describe and investigate nonstandard hull of a lattice-normed space, which is a generalization of nonstandard hull of a normed space.
