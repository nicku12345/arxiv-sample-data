Configurations of subspaces like equichordal and equiisoclinic tight fusion frames, which are in some sense optimally spread apart and which also have reconstruction properties emulating those of orthonormal bases, are useful in various applications, such as wireless communications and quantum information theory. In this paper, a new construction of infinite classes of equichordal tight fusion frames built on semiregular divisible difference sets is presented. Sometimes this construction yields an equiisoclinic packing. Each of the constructed fusion frames is shown to have both a flat representation and a sparse representation. Furthermore, integrality conditions which characterize when equichordal and equiisoclinic fusion frames can have orthonormal bases with entries in a subring of the algebraic integers are proven.
