It is proved that a commutative algebra A of operators in a reflexive real Banach space has an invariant subspace if each operator T\in A satisfies the condition \|1- \varepsilon T^2\|_e \le 1 + o(\varepsilon) \text{ when } \varepsilon\searrow 0, where \|\cdot\|_e is the essential norm. This implies the existence of an invariant subspace for every commutative family of essentially selfadjoint operators in a real Hilbert space.
