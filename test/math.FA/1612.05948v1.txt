A topological space is said to be sequential if every sequentially closed subspace is closed. We consider Banach spaces with weak*-sequential dual ball. In particular, we show that if X is a Banach space with weak*-sequentially compact dual ball and Y \subset X is a subspace such that Y and X/Y have weak*-sequential dual ball, then X has weak*-sequential dual ball. As an application we obtain that the Johnson-Lindenstrauss space JL_2 and C(K) for K scattered compact space of countable height are examples of Banach spaces with weak*-sequential dual ball, answering in this way a question of A. Plichko.
