Let G be a simply connected, connected completely solvable Lie group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{p}+\mathfrak{m}. Next, let \pi be an infinite-dimensional unitary irreducible representation of G obtained by inducing a character from a closed normal subgroup P=\exp\mathfrak{p} of G. Additionally, we assume that G=P\rtimes M, M=\exp\mathfrak{m} is a closed subgroup of G, d\mu_{M} is a fixed Haar measure on the solvable Lie group M and there exists a linear functional \lambda\in\mathfrak{p}^{\ast} such that the representation \pi=\pi_{\lambda}=\mathrm{ind}_{P}^{G}\left( \chi_{\lambda}\right)  is realized as acting in L^{2}\left( M,d\mu_{M}\right) . Making no assumption on the integrability of \pi_{\lambda}, we describe explicitly a discrete subgroup \Gamma\subset G and a vector \mathbf{f}\in L^{2}\left( M,d\mu_{M}\right)  such that \pi_{\lambda }\left( \Gamma\right) \mathbf{f} is a tight frame for L^{2}\left( M,d\mu_{M}\right) . We also construct compactly supported smooth functions \mathbf{s} and discrete subsets \Gamma\subset G such that \pi_{\lambda }\left( \Gamma\right) \mathbf{s} is a frame for L^{2}\left( M,d\mu_{M}\right) .
