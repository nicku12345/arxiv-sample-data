We show a few fixed point theorems for semigroups acting on weakly compact convex subsets of Banach spaces when LUC(S), AP(S), WAP(S) or WAP(S)\cap LUC(S) have a left invariant mean. In particular, we give a characterization of semitopological semigroups that have a left invariant mean on the space of weakly almost periodic functions in terms of a fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings. It answers, in the case of Banach spaces, Question 4 of [A.T.-M. Lau, Y. Zhang, J. Funct. Anal. 263 (2012), 2949--2977] in affirmative. We also extend the fixed point theorem of R. Hsu from left reversible discrete semigroups to left amenable semitopological semigroups in Banach spaces.
