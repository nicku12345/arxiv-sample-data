Let X and Y be Banach spaces and let \Omega be a compact Hausdorff space. Denote by \mathcal{C}_{p}(\Omega,X) the space of p-continous X-valued functions, 1\leq p\leq \infty. For operators S\in\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{C}(\Omega),\mathcal{L}(X,Y)) and U\in\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{C}_{p}(\Omega,X),Y), we establish integral representation theorems with respect to a vector measure m:\Sigma\rightarrow \mathcal{L}(X,Y^{**}), where \Sigma denotes the \sigma-algebra of Borel subsets of \Omega. The first theorem extends the classical Bartle-Dunford-Schwartz representation theorem. It is used to prove the second theorem, which extends the classical Dinculeanu-Singer representation theorem, also providing to it an alternative simpler proof. For the latter (and the main) result, we build the needed integration theory, relying on a new concept of the q-semivariation, 1\leq q\leq \infty, of a vector measure m:\Sigma\rightarrow \mathcal{L}(X,Y^{**}).
