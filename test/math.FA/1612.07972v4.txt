In the deBranges-Rovnyak functional model for contractions on Hilbert space, any completely non-coisometric (CNC) contraction is represented as the adjoint of the restriction of the backward shift to a deBranges-Rovnyak space, \mathscr{H} (b), associated to a contractive analytic operator-valued function, b, on the open unit disk.   We extend this model to a large class of CNC row contractions of several copies of a Hilbert space into itself (including all CNC row contractions with commuting component operators). Namely, we completely characterize the set of all CNC row contractions, T, which are unitarily equivalent to an extremal Gleason solution for a deBranges-Rovnyak space, \mathscr{H} (b_T), contractively contained in a vector-valued Drury-Arveson space of analytic functions on the open unit ball in several complex dimensions. Here, a Gleason solution is the appropriate several-variable analogue of the adjoint of the restricted backward shift and the characteristic function, b_T, belongs to the several-variable Schur class of contractive multipliers between vector-valued Drury-Arveson spaces. The characteristic function, b_T, is a unitary invariant, and we further characterize a natural sub-class of CNC row contractions for which it is a complete unitary invariant.
