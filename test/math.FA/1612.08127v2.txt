Let X be a Banach space and K an absolutely convex, weak^\ast-compact subset of X^\ast. We study consequences of K having a large or undefined Szlenk index and subsequently derive a number of related results concerning basic sequences and universal operators. We show that if X has a countable Szlenk index then X admits a subspace Y such that Y has a basis and the Szlenk indices of Y are comparable to the Szlenk indices of X. If X is separable, then X also admits subspace Z such that the quotient X/Z has a basis and the Szlenk indices of X/Z are comparable to the Szlenk indices of X. We also show that for a given ordinal \xi the class of operators whose Szlenk index is not an ordinal less than or equal to \xi admits a universal element if and only if \xi<\omega_1; W.B. Johnson's theorem that the formal identity map from \ell_1 to \ell_\infty is a universal non-compact operator is then obtained as a corollary. Stronger results are obtained for operators having separable codomain.
