This paper constructs a Hardy-Littlewood type maximal operator adapted to the Schr\"{o}dinger operator \mathcal{L} := -\Delta + |x|^{2} acting on L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). It achieves this through the use of the Gaussian grid \Delta^{\gamma}_{0}, constructed by J. Maas, J. van Neerven and P. Portal with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator in mind. At the scale of this grid, this maximal operator will resemble the classical Hardy-Littlewood operator. At a larger scale, the cubes of the maximal function are decomposed into cubes from \Delta^{\gamma}_{0} and weighted appropriately. Through this maximal function, a new class of weights is defined, A_{p}^{+}, with the property that for any w \in A_{p}^{+}, the heat maximal operator associated with \mathcal{L} is bounded from L^{p}(w) to itself. This class contains any other known class that possesses this property. In particular, it is strictly larger than A_{p}.
