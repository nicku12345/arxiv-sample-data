The paper studies Bernstein type inequalities for restrictions of holomorphic polynomials to graphs \Gamma_f\subset\mathbb C^{n+m} of holomorphic maps f:\mathbb C^n\rightarrow\mathbb C^m. We establish general properties of exponents in such inequalities and describe some classes of graphs admitting Bernstein type inequalities of optimal exponents and of exponents of polynomial growth.
