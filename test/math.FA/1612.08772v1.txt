\newcommand{mc}[1]{\mathcal{#1}} \newcommand{D}{\mc{D}(\mc{Q},L^p,\ell_w^q)} We present a framework for the construction of structured, possibly compactly supported Banach frames and atomic decompositions for decomposition spaces. Such a space \D is defined using a frequency covering \mc{Q}=(Q_i)_{i\in I}: If (\varphi_i)_{i} is a suitable partition of unity subordinate to \mc{Q}, then \Vert g\Vert_{\D}:=\left\Vert\left(\Vert\mc{F}^{-1}(\varphi_i\hat{g})\Vert_{L^p}\right)_{i}\right\Vert_{\ell_w^q}.   We assume \mc{Q}=(T_iQ+b_i)_{i}, with T_i\in{\rm GL}(\Bbb{R}^d),b_i\in\Bbb{R}^d. Given a prototype \gamma, we consider the system \[\Psi_{c}=(L_{c\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\gamma^{[i]})_{i\in I,k\in\Bbb{Z}^d}\text{ with }\gamma^{[i]}=|\det T_i|^{1/2}\, M_{b_i}(\gamma\circ T_i^T),\] with translation L_x and modulation M_{\xi}. We provide verifiable conditions on \gamma under which \Psi_c forms a Banach frame or an atomic decomposition for \D, for small enough sampling density c>0. Our theory allows compactly supported prototypes and applies for arbitrary p,q\in(0,\infty].   Often, \Psi_c is both a Banach frame and an atomic decomposition, so that analysis sparsity is equivalent to synthesis sparsity, i.e. the analysis coefficients (\langle f,L_{c\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\gamma^{[i]}\rangle)_{i,k} lie in \ell^p iff f belongs to a certain decomposition space, iff f=\sum_{i,k}c_k^{(i)}\cdot L_{c\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\gamma^{[i]} with (c_k^{(i)})_{i,k}\in\ell^p. This is convenient if only analysis sparsity is known to hold: Generally, this only yields synthesis sparsity w.r.t. the dual frame, about which often only little is known. But our theory yields synthesis sparsity w.r.t. the well-understood primal frame.   In particular, our theory applies to \alpha-modulation spaces and inhom. Besov spaces. It also applies to shearlet frames, as we show in a companion paper.
