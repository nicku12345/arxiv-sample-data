We prove that the weak Morrey space WM^{p}_{q} is contained in the Morrey space M^{p}_{q_{1}} for 1\leq q_{1}< q\leq p<\infty. As applications, we show that if the commutator [b,T] is bounded from L^p to L^{p,\infty} for some p\in (1,\infty), then b\in \mathrm{BMO}, where T is a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator. Also, for 1<p\leq q<\infty, b\in \mathrm{BMO} if and only if [b,T] is bounded from M^{p}_{q} to WM_{q}^{p}. For b belonging to Lipschitz class, we obtain similar results.
