Global and local weighted Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities with doubling measures are established. These inequalities are key ingredients for the regularity theory and existence of strong solutions for strongly coupled parabolic and elliptic systems which are degenerate or singular because of the unboundedness of dependent and independent variables.
