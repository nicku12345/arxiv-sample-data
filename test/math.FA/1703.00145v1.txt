In this article, we give new results in the startpoint theory for quasi-pseudometric spaces. The results we present provide us with the existence of startpoint (endpoint, fixed point) for multi-valued maps defined on a bicomplete quasi-pseudometric space. We characterise the existence of startpoint and endpoint by the so-called \textit{mix-point property}. The present results extend known ones in the area.
