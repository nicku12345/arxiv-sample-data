In this article, we study multivariate generalizations of the Matsaev's conjecture in commutative and non-commutative L^p-spaces.We prove that the multivariate analogue of Matsaev's conjecture is eventually false for all 1<p<\infty. We exhibit various joint dilation results on non-commutative L^p-spaces.
