The purpose of this article is to develop a technique to estimate certain bounds for entropy numbers of diagonal operator on spaces of p-summable sequences for finite p greater than 1. The approximation method we develop in this direction works for a very general class of operators between Banach spaces, in particular reflexive spaces. As a consequence of this technique we also obtain that the entropy number of a bounded linear operator T between two separable Hilbert spaces is equal to the entropy number of the adjoint of T. This gives a complete answer to the question posed by B. Carl [4] in the setting of separable Hilbert spaces.
