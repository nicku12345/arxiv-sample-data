Let \mathcal{A} be a finite-dimensional subspace of C(\mathcal{X};\mathbb{R}), where \mathcal{X} is a locally compact Hausdorff space, and \mathsf{A}=\{f_1,\dots,f_m\} a basis of \mathcal{A}. A sequence s=(s_j)_{j=1}^m is called a moment sequence if s_j=\int f_j(x) \, d\mu(x), j=1,\dots,m, for some positive Radon measure \mu on \mathcal{X}. Each moment sequence s has a finitely atomic representing measure \mu. The smallest possible number of atoms is called the Carath\'eodory number \mathcal{C}_{\mathsf{A}}(s). The largest number \mathcal{C}_{\mathsf{A}}(s) among all moment sequences s is the Carath\'eodory number \mathcal{C}_{\mathsf{A}}. In this paper the Carath\'eodory numbers \mathcal{C}_{\mathsf{A}}(s) and \mathcal{C}_{\mathsf{A}} are studied. In the case of differentiable functions methods from differential geometry are used. The main emphasis is on real polynomials. For a large class of spaces of polynomials in one variable the number \mathcal{C}_{\mathsf{A}} is determined. In the multivariate case we obtain some lower bounds and we use results on zeros of positive polynomials to derive upper bounds for the Carath\'eodory numbers.
