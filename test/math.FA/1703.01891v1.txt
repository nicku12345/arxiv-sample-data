Let \lambda be a large enough cardinal number (assuming GCH it suffices to let \lambda=\aleph_\omega). If X is a Banach space with \text{dens}(X)\ge\lambda, which admits a coarse (or uniform) embedding into any c_0(\Gamma), then X fails to have nontrivial cotype, i.e. X contains \ell_\infty^n C-uniformly for every C>1. In the special case when X has a symmetric basis, we may even conclude that it is linearly isomorphic with c_0(\text{dens}X).
