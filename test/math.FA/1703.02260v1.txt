Consider two continuous linear operators T\colon X_1(\mu)\to Y_1(\nu) and S\colon X_2(\mu)\to Y_2(\nu) between Banach function spaces related to different \sigma-finite measures \mu and \nu. We characterize by means of weighted norm inequalities when T can be strongly factored through S, that is, when there exist functions g and h such that T(f)=gS(hf) for all f\in X_1(\mu). For the case of spaces with Schauder basis our characterization can be improved, as we show when S is for instance the Fourier operator, or the Ces\`aro operator. Our aim is to study the case when the map T is besides injective. Then we say that it is a~representing operator ---in the sense that it allows to represent each elements of the Banach function space X(\mu) by a~sequence of generalized Fourier coefficients---, providing a complete characterization of these maps in terms of weighted norm inequalities. Some examples and applications involving recent results on the Hausdorff-Young and the Hardy-Littlewood inequalities for operators on weighted Banach function spaces are also provided.
