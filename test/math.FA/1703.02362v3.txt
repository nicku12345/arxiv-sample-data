Ideals of polynomials and multilinear operators between Banach spaces have been exhaustively investigated in the last decades. In this paper, we introduce a unified (and more general) approach and propose some lines of investigation in this new framework. Among other results, we prove a Bohnenblust--Hille inequality in this more general setting.
