We give some new refinements of Heinz inequality and an improvement of the reverse Young's inequality for scalars and we use them to establish new inequalities for operators and the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of matrices. We give a uniformly and abbreviated form of the inequalities presented by Kittaneh and Mansarah, and the inequalities presented by Kai and we obtain some of their operator and matrix versions.
