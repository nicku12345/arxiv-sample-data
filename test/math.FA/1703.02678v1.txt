We show that a scalable frame does phase retrieval if and only if the hyperplanes of its orthogonal complements do phase retrieval. We then show this result fails in general by giving an example of a frame for \mathbb R^3 which does phase retrieval but its induced hyperplanes fail phase retrieval. Moreover, we show that such frames always exist in \mathbb R^d for any dimension d. We also give an example of a frame in \mathbb R^3 which fails phase retrieval but its perps do phase retrieval. We will also see that a family of hyperplanes doing phase retrieval in \mathbb R^d must contain at least 2d-2 hyperplanes. Finally, we provide an example of six hyperplanes in \mathbb R^4 which do phase retrieval.
