The well known Weyl's asymptotic formula gives an approximation to the number \mathcal{N}_{\omega} of eigenvalues (counted with multiplicities) on an interval [0,\>\omega] of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a compact Riemannian manifold {\bf M}. In this paper we approach this question from the point of view of Shannon-type sampling on compact Riemannian manifolds. Namely, we give a direct proof that \mathcal{N}_{\omega} is comparable to cardinality of certain sampling sets for the subspace of \omega-bandlimited functions on {\bf M}.
