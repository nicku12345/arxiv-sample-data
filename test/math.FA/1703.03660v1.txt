A J-frame for a Krein space \mathcal{H} is in particular a frame for \mathcal{H} (in the Hilbert space sense). But it is also compatible with the indefinite inner-product of \mathcal{H}, meaning that it determines a pair of maximal uniformly definite subspaces, an analogue to the maximal dual pair associated to an orthonormal basis in a Krein space. This work is devoted to study duality for J-frames in Krein spaces. Also, tight and Parseval J-frames are defined and characterized.
