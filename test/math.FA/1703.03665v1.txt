A J-frame is a frame \mathcal{F} for a Krein space (\mathcal{H}, [\, , \,]) which is compatible with the indefinite inner product [\, , \, ] in the sense that it induces an indefinite reconstruction formula that resembles those produced by orthonormal bases in \mathcal{H}. With every J-frame the so-called J-frame operator is associated, which is a self-adjoint operator in the Krein space \mathcal{H}. The J-frame operator plays an essential role in the indefinite reconstruction formula.   In this paper we characterize the class of J-frame operators in a Krein space by a 2\times 2 block operator representation. The J-frame bounds of \mathcal{F} are then recovered as the suprema and infima of the numerical ranges of some uniformly positive operators which are build from the entries of the 2\times 2 block representation. Moreover, this 2\times 2 block representation is utilized to obtain enclosures for the spectrum of J-frame operators, which finally leads to the construction of a square root. This square root allows a complete description of all J-frames associated with a given J-frame operator.
