Given a Furstenberg family \mathscr{F} of subsets of \mathbb{N}, an operator T on a topological vector space X is called \mathscr{F}-transitive provided for each non-empty open subsets U, V of X the set \{n\in \mathbb{Z}_+ : T^n(U)\cap V\neq\emptyset\} belongs to \mathscr{F}. We classify the topologically transitive operators with a hierarchy of \mathscr{F}-transitive subclasses by considering families \mathscr{F} that are determined by various notions of largeness and density in \mathbb{Z}_+.
