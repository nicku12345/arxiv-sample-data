In this paper we solve the problem of approximating functionals (\varphi(A)x, f) (where \varphi(A) is some function of self-adjoint operator A) on the class of elements of a Hilbert space that is defined with the help of another function \psi (A) of the operator A. In addition, we obtain a series of sharp Taikov-type additive inequalities that estimate |(\varphi(A)x, f)| with the help of \| \psi (A)x\| and \| x\|. We also present several applications of the obtained results. First, we find sharp constants in inequalities of the type used in H{\rm{\ddot{o}}}rmander theorem on comparison of operators in the case when operators are acting in a Hilbert space and are functions of a self-adjoint operator. As another application we obtain Taikov-type inequalities for functions of the operator \frac1i \frac {d}{dt} in the spaces L_2(\RR) and L_2(\TT), as well as for integrals with respect to spectral measures, defined with the help of classical orthogonal polynomials.
