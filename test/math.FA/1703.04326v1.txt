A space of entire functions of several complex variables rapidly decreasing on {\mathbb R}^n and such that their growth along i{\mathbb R}^n is majorized with the help of a family of weight functions is considered in this paper. For such space an equivalent description in terms of estimates on all of its partial derivatives as functions on {\mathbb R}^n and a Paley-Wiener type theorem are obtained.
