In this paper we introduced a new characteristics of the elements of a Hilbert space - generalized moduli of continuity \omega_\varphi(x;L_{p,V}([0,\delta])) and obtain new exact inequalities of Jackson - Stechkin type with these moduli of continuity for the approximation of elements of a Hilbert space. These results include many well-known inequalities for approximation of periodic functions by trigonometric polynomials, approximation of non-periodic functions by entire functions of exponential type, similar results for almost periodic functions, and others. A number of results is new even in these classic situations.
