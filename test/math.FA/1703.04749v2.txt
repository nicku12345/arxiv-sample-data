We characterise the class of those Banach spaces in which every convex combination of slices of the unit ball intersects the unit sphere as the class of those spaces in which every convex combination of slices of the unit ball contains two points at distance exactly two. Also, we study when the convex combinations of slices of the unit ball are relatively open or has non-empty relative interior for different topologies, studying the relationship between them and studying these properties for L_{\infty}-spaces and preduals of L_1-spaces.
