We determine the boundedness and compactness of a large class of operators, mapping from general Banach spaces of holomorphic functions into a particular type of spaces of functions determined by the growth of the functions, or the growth of the functions derivatives. The results show that the boundedness and compactness of such intrinsic operators depends only on the behaviour on the point evaluation functionals. They also generalize previous similar results about several specific classes of operators, such as the multiplication, composition and integral operators.
