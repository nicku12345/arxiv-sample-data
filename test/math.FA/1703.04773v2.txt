It is known that homogeneous polynomials on Banach spaces cannot be hypercyclic, but there are examples of hypercyclic homogeneous polynomials on some non-normable Fr\'echet spaces. We show the existence of hypercyclic polynomials on H(\mathbb C), by exhibiting a concrete polynomial which is also the first example of a frequently hypercyclic homogeneous polynomial on any F-space.   We prove that the homogeneous polynomial on  H(\mathbb C) defined as the product of a translation operator and the evaluation at 0 is mixing, frequently hypercyclic and chaotic. We prove, in contrast, that some natural related polynomials fail to be hypercyclic.
