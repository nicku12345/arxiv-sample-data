Denote by T and I_{\alpha} the bilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators and bilinear fractional integrals, respectively. In this paper, it is proved that if b_{1},b_{2}\in {\rm CMO} (the {\rm BMO}-closure of C^{\infty}_{c}(\mathbb{R}^n)), [\Pi \vec{b},T] and [\Pi\vec{b},I_{\alpha}] (\vec{b}=(b_{1},b_{2})) are all the compact operators from \mathcal{M}^{p_{0}}_{\vec{P}} (the norm of \mathcal{M}^{p_{0}}_{\vec{P}} is strictly smaller than 2-fold product of the Morrey norms) to M^{q_{0}}_{q} for some suitable indexes p_{0},p_{1},p_{2} and q_{0},q. Specially, we also show that if b_{1}=b_{2}, then b_{1}, b_{2}\in {\rm CMO} is necessary for the compactness of [\Pi\vec{b},I_{\alpha}] on Morrey space.
