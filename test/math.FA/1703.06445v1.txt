We construct a family of spline affine Riesz bases, i.e. sequences of dilations and translations generated by the special spline functions \psi_m, and we prove that their Riesz bounds are independent of m. We put \psi_0=\chi as the Haar step function and every following function \psi_{m+1} is obtained by integrating the previous function \psi_m with consequent antiperiodization. We give a representation of the spline \psi_m as a finite sum of Rademacher chaos series and we use a notion of a simple Walsh spectrum of a function in connection with orthogonality of affine systems.
