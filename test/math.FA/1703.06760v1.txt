In this paper we prove that if E and F are reflexive Banach spaces and G is a closed linear subspace of the space \mathcal{P}_{w}(^{n}E;F) of all n-homogeneous polynomials from E to F which are weakly continuous on bounded sets, then G is either reflexive or non-isomorphic to a dual space. This result generalizes \cite[Theorem 2]{FEDER} and gives the solution to a problem posed by Feder \cite[Problem 1]{FED}.
