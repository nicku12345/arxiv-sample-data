Let G be a locally compact group, and let 1\le p < \infty. Consider the weighted L^p-space L^p(G,\omega)=\{f:\int|f\omega|^p<\infty\}, where \omega:G\to \mathbb R is a positive measurable function. Under appropriate conditions on \omega, G acts on L^p(G,\omega) by translations. When is this action hypercyclic, that is, there is a function in this space such that the set of all its translations is dense in L^p(G,\omega)? H. Salas (1995) gave a criterion of hypercyclicity in the case G=\mathbb Z . Under mild assumptions, we present a corresponding characterization for a general locally compact group G. Our results are obtained in a more general setting when the translations only by a subset S\subset G are considered.
