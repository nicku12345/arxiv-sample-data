In this paper we are concerned with the recent summability notion of I-statistically pre-Cauchy real double sequences in line of Das et. al. [6] as a generalization of I-statistical convergence. Here we introduce the notion of double I-natural density and present some interesting properties of I-statistically pre-Cauchy double sequences of real numbers. Also in this paper we investigate the notion of I-statistical cluster point of double sequences in finite dimensional normed space.
