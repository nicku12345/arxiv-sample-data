In this short paper, we will show that the space of real valued uniformly continuous functions defined on a metric space (X,d) is a ring if and only if every subset A\subset X has one of the following properties:   A is Bourbaki-bounded, i.e., every uniformly continuous function on X is bounded on A. A contains an infinite uniformly isolated subset, i.e., there exist \delta>0 and an infinite subset F\subset A such that d(a,x)\geq \delta for every a\in F, x\in X.
