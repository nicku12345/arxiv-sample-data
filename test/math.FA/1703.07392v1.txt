In this paper, we give a new inequality for convex functions of real variables, and we apply this inequality to obtain considerable generalizations, refinements, and reverses of the Young and Heinz inequalities for positive scalars. Applications to unitarily invariant norm inequalities involving positive semidefinite matrices are also given.
