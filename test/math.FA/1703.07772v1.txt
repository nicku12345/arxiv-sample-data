The aim of this paper is to introduce and investigate a new class of separable Banach spaces modeled after an example of Garling from 1968. For each 1\leqslant p<\infty and each nonincreasing weight \textbf{w}\in c_0\setminus\ell_1 we exhibit an \ell_p-saturated, complementably homogeneous, and uniformly subprojective Banach space g(\textbf{w},p). We also show that g(\textbf{w},p) admits a unique subsymmetric basis despite the fact that for a wide class of weights it does not admit a symmetric basis. This provides the first known examples of Banach spaces where those two properties coexist.
