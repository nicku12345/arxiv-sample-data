Let (\Omega_1, \mathcal{F}_1, \mu_1) and (\Omega_2, \mathcal{F}_2, \mu_2) be two measure spaces and let 1 \leq p,q \leq +\infty. We give a definition of Schur multipliers on \mathcal{B}(L^p(\Omega_1), L^q(\Omega_2)) which extends the definition of classical Schur multipliers on \mathcal{B}(\ell_p,\ell_q). Our main result is a characterization of Schur multipliers in the case 1\leq q \leq p \leq +\infty. When 1 < q \leq p < +\infty, \phi \in L^{\infty}(\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2) is a Schur multiplier on \mathcal{B}(L^p(\Omega_1), L^q(\Omega_2)) if and only if there are a measure space (a probability space when p\neq q) (\Omega,\mu), a\in L^{\infty}(\mu_1, L^{p}(\mu)) and b\in L^{\infty}(\mu_2, L^{q'}(\mu)) such that, for almost every (s,t) \in \Omega_1 \times \Omega_2, \phi(s,t)=\left\langle a(s), b(t) \right\rangle. Here, L^{\infty}(\mu_1, L^{r}(\mu)) denotes the Bochner space on \Omega_1 valued in L^r(\mu). This result is new, even in the classical case. As a consequence, we give new inclusion relationships between the spaces of Schur multipliers on \mathcal{B}(\ell_p,\ell_q).
