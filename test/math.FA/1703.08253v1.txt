Let A_p(G) denote the Figa-Talamanca-Herz Banach Algebra of the locally compact group G, thus A_2(G) is the Fourier Algebra of G. If G is commutative then A_2(G)=L^1(\hat{G}){\hat{}}. Let A^r_p(G)=A_p\cap L^r(G) with norm ||u||_{A_p^r}=||u||_{A_p}+||u||_{L^r}. We investigate a property which insures not only existence of solutions to optimization problems but moreover, facility in testing that an algorithm converges to such solutions namely the RNP. Theorem(a): If G is weakly amenable then A_p^r is a dual Banach space with RNP if 1\leq r\leq p'. This does not hold if G=SL(2,R), p=2 and r>2. Theorem(b): If G is weakly amenable and second countable and A^t_p has the RNP for t=s, then it has the RNP for all 1\leq t\leq s, where s=\infty is allowed. In particular second countable noncompact groups G, for which A_p(G) has RNP, namely Fell groups, have to satisfy that A_p^r(G) has the RNP for all 1\leq r<\infty. The results are new, even if G=\mathbb{Z}, the additive integers.
