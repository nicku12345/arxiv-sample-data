A Wilson system is a collection of finite linear combinations of time frequency shifts of a square integrable function. In this paper we use the fact that a Wilson system is a shift-invariant system to explore its relationship with Gabor systems. It is well known that, starting from a tight Gabor frame for L^{2}(\mathbb{R}) with redundancy 2, one can construct an orthonormal Wilson basis for L^{2}(\mathbb{R}) whose generator is well localized in the time-frequency plane. In this paper, we show that one can construct multi-dimensional orthonormal Wilson bases starting from tight Gabor frames of redundancy 2^k where k=1, 2, ..., d. These results generalize most of the known results about the existence of orthonormal Wilson bases.
