This paper provides sufficient conditions for the boundedness of Weyl operators on modulation spaces. The Weyl symbols belong to Wiener amalgam spaces, or generalized modulation spaces, as recently renamed by their inventor Hans Feichtinger. This is the first result which relates symbols in Wiener amalgam spaces to operators acting on classical modulation spaces.
