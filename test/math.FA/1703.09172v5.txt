Motivated by a question posed by Sophie Grivaux concerning the regularity of the orbits of frequently hypercylic operators, we show the following: for any operator T on a separable metrizable and complete topological vector space X which is both frequently hypercyclic and piecewise syndetic hypercyclic, the lower density and upper Banach density of the recurrence set \{n\geq 1: T^n x\in U\} are different, for any hypercyclic vector x\in X for T, and a certain collection of non-empty open sets U\subseteq X. As an immediate consequence we got a sufficient condition for a chaotic operator to be non frequently hypercyclic.
