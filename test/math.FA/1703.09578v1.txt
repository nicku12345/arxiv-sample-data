We prove that the unitary affine Radon transform intertwines the quasi-regular representation of a class of semidirect products, built by shearlet dilation groups and translations, and the tensor product of a standard wavelet representation with a wavelet-like representation. This yields a formula for shearlet coefficients that involves only integral transforms applied to the affine Radon transform of the signal, thereby opening new perspectives in the inversion of the Radon transform.
