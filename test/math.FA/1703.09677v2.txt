This paper generalizes the classical Sz.-Nagy--Foias H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}) functional calculus for Hilbert space contractions. In particular, we replace the single contraction T with a tuple T=(T_1, \dots, T_d) of commuting bounded operators on a Hilbert space and replace H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}) with a large class of multiplier algebras of Hilbert function spaces on the unit ball in \mathbb C^d.
