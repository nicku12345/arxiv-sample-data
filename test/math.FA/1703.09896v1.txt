We find a concrete integral formula for the class of generalized Toeplitz operators T_a in Bergman spaces A^p, 1<p<\infty, studied in an earlier work by the authors. The result is extended to little Hankel operators. We give an example of an L^2-symbol a such that T_{|a|}  fails to be bounded in A^2, although T_a : A^2 \to A^2 is seen to be bounded by using the generalized definition. We also confirm that the generalized definition coincides with the classical one whenever the latter makes sense.
