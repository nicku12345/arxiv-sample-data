We prove that the uniform probability measure \mu on every (n-k)-dimensional projection of the n-dimensional unit cube verifies the variance conjecture with an absolute constant C \textrm{Var}_\mu|x|^2\leq C \sup_{\theta\in S^{n-1}}{\mathbb E}_\mu\langle x,\theta\rangle^2{\mathbb E}_\mu|x|^2,  provided that 1\leq k\leq\sqrt n. We also prove that if 1\leq k\leq n^{\frac{2}{3}}(\log n)^{-\frac{1}{3}}, the conjecture is true for the family of uniform probabilities on its projections on random (n-k)-dimensional subspaces.
