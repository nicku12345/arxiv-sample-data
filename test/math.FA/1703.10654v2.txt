In this paper, we generalize the concept of unbounded norm (un) convergence: let X be a normed lattice and Y a vector lattice such that X is an order dense ideal in Y; we say that a net (y_\alpha) un-converges to y in Y with respect to X if \Bigl\lVert\lvert y_\alpha-y\rvert \wedge x\Bigr\rVert\to 0 for every x\in X_+. We extend several known results about un-convergence and un-topology to this new setting. We consider the special case when Y is the universal completion of X. If Y=L_0(\mu), the space of all \mu-measurable functions, and X is an order continuous Banach function space in Y, then the un-convergence on Y agrees with the convergence in measure. If X is atomic and order complete and Y=\mathbb R^A then the un-convergence on Y agrees with the coordinate-wise convergence.
