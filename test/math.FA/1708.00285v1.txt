In this paper, the central BMO spaces with variable exponent are introduced. As an application, we characterize these spaces by the boundedness of commutators of Hardy operator and its dual operator on variable Lebesgue spaces. The boundedness of vector-valued commutators on Herz spaces with variable exponent are also considered.
