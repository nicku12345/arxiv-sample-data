A tuple of commuting operators (S_1,\dots,S_{n-1},P) for which the closed symmetrized polydisc \Gamma_n is a spectral set is called a \Gamma_n-contraction. We show that every \Gamma_n-contraction admits a decomposition into a \Gamma_n-unitary and a completely non-unitary \Gamma_n-contraction. This decomposition is an analogue to the canonical decomposition of a contraction into a unitary and a completely non-unitary contraction. We also find new characterizations for the set \Gamma_n and \Gamma_n-contractions.
