The idea of convex sets and various related results in 2-Probabilistic normed spaces were established in [HR]. In this paper, We obtain the concepts of convex series closedness, convex series compactness, boundedness and their interrelationships in Menger's 2-probabilistic normed space. Finally, the idea of  \mathcal{D}-  Boundedness in Menger's 2-probabilistic normed spaces and Menger's Generalized 2-Probabilistic Normed spaces are discussed.
