Let \Gamma be a rectifiable Jordan curve, let X and Y be two reflexive Banach function spaces over \Gamma such that the Cauchy singular integral operator S is bounded on each of them, and let M(X,Y) denote the space of pointwise multipliers from X to Y. Consider the Riesz projection P=(I+S)/2, the corresponding Hardy type subspaces PX and PY, and the Toeplitz operator T(a):PX\to PY defined by T(a)f=P(af) for a symbol a\in M(X,Y). We show that if X\hookrightarrow Y and a\in M(X,Y)\setminus\{0\}, then T(a)\in\mathcal{L}(PX,PY) has a trivial kernel in PX or a dense image in PY. In particular, if 1<q\le p<\infty, 1/r=1/q-1/p, and a\in L^{r}\equiv M(L^p,L^q) is a nonzero function, then the Toeplitz operator T(a), acting from the Hardy space H^p to the Hardy space H^q, has a trivial kernel in H^p or a dense image in H^q.
