Avicou, Chalendar and Partington proved that an (unbounded) operator (Af)=G\cdot f' on the classical Hardy space generates a C_0 semigroup of composition operators if and only if it generates a quasicontractive semigroup. Here we prove that if such an operator A generates a C_0 semigroup, then it is automatically a semigroup of composition operators, so that the condition of quasicontractivity of the semigroup in the cited result is not necessary. Our result applies to a rather general class of Banach spaces of analytic functions in the unit disc.
