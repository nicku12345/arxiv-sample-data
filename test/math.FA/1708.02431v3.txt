We introduce and study the notion of space of almost universal complemented disposition (a.u.c.d.) as a generalization of Kadec space. We show that every Banach space with separable dual is isometrically contained as a 1-complemented subspace of a separable a.u.c.d. space and that all a.u.c.d. spaces with 1-FDD are isometric and contain isometric 1-complemented copies of every separable Banach space with 1-FDD. We then study spaces of universal complemented disposition (u.c.d.) and provide different constructions for such spaces. We also consider spaces of u.c.d. with respect to separable spaces.
