We give sufficient conditions for the continuity in norm of the translation operator in the Musielak-Orlicz LM spaces. An application to the convergence in norm of approximate identities is given, whereby we prove density results of the smooth functions in LM, in both modular and norm topologies. These density results are then applied to obtain basic topological properties.
