This paper brings results about the behavior of sequences of eigenvalues or singular values of integral operators generated by square-integrable kernels on the real m-dimensional unit sphere, m\leq2. Under smoothness assumptions on the generating kernels, given via Laplace-Beltrami differentiability, we obtain super-exponential decay rates for the eigenvalues of the generated positive integral operators and for singular values of those integral operators which are non-positive. We show an optimal-type result and provide a list of parametric families of kernels which are of interest for numerical analysis and geostatistical communities and satisfy the smoothness assumptions for the positive case.
