We prove a characterization for the Peetre type K-functional on \mathbb{M}, a compact two-point homogeneous space, in terms the rate of approximation of a family of multipliers operator defined to this purpose. This extends the well known results on the spherical setting. The characterization is employed to show that an abstract H\"{o}lder condition or finite order of differentiability condition imposed on kernels generating certain operators implies a sharp decay rates for their eigenvalues sequences. The latest is employed to obtain estimates for the Kolmogorov n-width of unit balls in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
