We establish a Fenchel-Moreau type theorem for proper convex functions f\colon X\to \bar{L}^0, where (X, Y, \langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle) is a dual pair of Banach spaces and \bar L^0 is the space of all extended real-valued functions on a \sigma-finite measure space. We introduce the concept of stable lower semi-continuity which is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a dual representation \smash{ f(x)=\sup_{y \in L^0(Y)} \left\{\langle x, y \rangle - f^\ast(y)\right\}, \quad x\in X,}  where L^0(Y) is the space of all strongly measurable functions with values in Y, and \langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle is understood pointwise almost everywhere. The proof is based on a conditional extension result and conditional functional analysis.
