We prove that any function in GSBD^p(\Omega), with \Omega a n-dimensional open bounded set with finite perimeter, is approximated by functions u_k\in SBV(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^n)\cap L^\infty(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^n) whose jump is a finite union of C^1 hypersurfaces. The approximation takes place in the sense of Griffith-type energies \int_\Omega W(e(u)) \,\mathrm{d}x +\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(J_u), e(u) and J_u being the approximate symmetric gradient and the jump set of u, and W a nonnegative function with p-growth, p>1. The difference between u_k and u is small in L^p outside a sequence of sets E_k\subset \Omega whose measure tends to 0 and if |u|^r \in L^1(\Omega) with r\in (0,p], then |u_k-u|^r \to 0 in L^1(\Omega). Moreover, an approximation property for the (truncation of the) amplitude of the jump holds. We apply the density result to deduce \Gamma-convergence approximation \emph{\`a la} Ambrosio-Tortorelli for Griffith-type energies with either Dirichlet boundary condition or a mild fidelity term, such that minimisers are \emph{a priori} not even in L^1(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^n).
