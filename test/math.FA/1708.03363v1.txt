We study the class of (p,q)-regular operators between quasi-Banach lattices. In particular, a representation of this class as the dual of a certain tensor norm for Banach lattices is given. We also provide some factorization results for (p,q)-regular operators yielding new Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type inequalities for Banach function spaces. An extension theorem for (q, \infty)-regular operators defined on a subspace of L_q is also given.
