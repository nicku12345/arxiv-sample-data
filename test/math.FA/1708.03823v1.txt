We first unify all notions of partial injectivity appearing in the literature ---(universal) separable injectivity, (universal) \aleph-injectivity --- in the notion of (\alpha, \beta)-injectivity ((\alpha, \beta)_\lambda-injectivity if the parameter \lambda has to be specified). Then, extend the notion of space of universal disposition to space of universal (\alpha, \beta)-disposition. Finally, we characterize the 1-complemented subspaces of spaces of universal (\alpha, \beta)-disposition as precisely the spaces (\alpha, \beta)_1-injective.
