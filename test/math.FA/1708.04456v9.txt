Define  A  a unbounded self-adjoint operator on Hilbert space  X . Let  \{ A_n \}  be its resolvent approximation sequence with closed range  \mathcal{R}(A_n) (n \in \mathrm{N}) , that is,  A_n (n \in \mathrm{N})  are all self-adjoint on Hilbert space  X  and \begin{equation*} \hbox{ \raise-2mm\hbox{\textstyle s-\lim \atop \scriptstyle {n \to \infty}}} R_\lambda (A_n)   = R_\lambda (A)\quad (\lambda \in \mathrm{C} \setminus \mathrm{R}), \ \textrm{where} \ R_ \lambda(A) := (\lambda I-A)^{-1}. \end{equation*} The Moore-Penrose inverse  A^\dagger_n \in \mathcal{B}(X)  is a natural approximation to the Moore-Penrose inverse  A^\dagger . This paper shows that:  A^\dagger  is continuous and strongly converged by  \{ A^\dagger_n \}  if and only if  \sup\limits_n \Vert A^\dagger_n \Vert < +\infty . On the other hand, this result tells that arbitrary bounded computational scheme  \{ A^\dagger_n \}  induced by resolvent approximation  \{ A_n \}  is naturally instable (that is,  \sup_n \Vert A^\dagger_n \Vert = \infty ) for any self-adjoint operator equation with non-closed range, for example, free Schr\"{o}dinger operator, Schr\"{o}dinger operator with Coulumb potential and Schr\"{o}dinger operator in model of many particles. This implies the infeasibility to globally and approximately solve non-closed range self-ajoint operator equation by resolvent approximation.
