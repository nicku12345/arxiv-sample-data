The classical Strichartz estimates for the free Schr\"odinger propagator have recently been substantially generalised to estimates of the form \[ \bigg\|\sum_j\lambda_j|e^{it\Delta}f_j|^2\bigg\|_{L^p_tL^q_x}\lesssim\|\lambda\|_{\ell^\alpha} \] for orthonormal systems (f_j)_j of initial data in L^2, firstly in work of Frank--Lewin--Lieb--Seiringer and later by Frank--Sabin. The primary objective is identifying the largest possible \alpha as a function of p and q, and in contrast to the classical case, for such estimates the critical case turns out to be (p,q) = (\frac{d+1}{d},\frac{d+1}{d-1}). We consider the case of orthonormal systems (f_j)_j in the homogeneous Sobolev spaces \dot{H}^s for s \in (0,\frac{d}{2}) and we establish the sharp value of \alpha as a function of p, q and s, except possibly an endpoint in certain cases, at which we establish some weak-type estimates. Furthermore, at the critical case (p,q) = (\frac{d+1}{d-2s},\frac{d(d+1)}{(d-1)(d-2s)}) for general s, we show the veracity of the desired estimates when \alpha = p if we consider frequency localised estimates, and the failure of the (non-localised) estimates when \alpha = p; this exhibits the difficulty of upgrading from frequency localised estimates in this context, again in contrast to the classical setting.
