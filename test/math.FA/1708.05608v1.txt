The aim of this work is to study the existence of a periodic solutions of integro-differential equations d dt [x(t)-- L(x t)] = A[x(t)-- L(x t)]+ G(x t)+ t --\infty a(t-- s)x(s)ds+ f (t), (0 \le t \le 2\pi) with the periodic condition x(0) = x(2\pi), where a \in L 1 (R +). Our approach is based on the M-boundedness of linear operators, Fourier type, B s p,q-multipliers and Besov spaces.
