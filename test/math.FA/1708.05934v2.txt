In this paper, we characterize bounded, compact or Schatten class weighted composition operators acting on Bergman spaces with the exponential type weights. Moreover, we give the proof of the necessary part for the boundedness of composition operators on large weighted Bergman spaces given by Kriete and Maccluer in 1992.
