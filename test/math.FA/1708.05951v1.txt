In this paper we present some reverses of the Golden-Thompson type inequalities:   Let H and K be Hermitian matrices such that  e^s e^H \preceq_{ols} e^K \preceq_{ols} e^t e^H for some scalars s \leq t, and \alpha \in [0 , 1]. Then for all p>0 and k =1,2,\ldots, n \begin{align*} \label{}   \lambda_k (e^{(1-\alpha)H + \alpha K} ) \leq (\max \lbrace S(e^{sp}), S(e^{tp})\rbrace)^{\frac{1}{p}} \lambda_k (e^{pH} \sharp_\alpha e^{pK})^{\frac{1}{p}}, \end{align*} where A\sharp_\alpha B = A^\frac{1}{2} \big ( A^{-\frac{1}{2}} B^\frac{1}{2} A^{-\frac{1}{2}} \big) ^\alpha A^\frac{1}{2} is \alpha-geometric mean, S(t) is the so called Specht's ratio and \preceq_{ols} is the so called Olson order. The same inequalities are also provided with other constants. The obtained inequalities improve some known results.
