This paper studies Laplace's equation -\Delta\,u=0 in an exterior region U\varsubsetneq{\mathbb R}^N, when N\geq3, subject to the nonlinear boundary condition \frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}=\lambda{\left\vert{u}\right\vert}^{q-2}u+\mu{\left\vert{u}\right\vert}^{p-2}u on \partial U with 1<q<2<p<2^*.   In the function space \mathscr{H}\left(U\right), one observes when \lambda>0 and \mu\in\mathbb R arbitrary, then there exists a sequence \left\{u_k\right\} of solutions with negative energy converging to 0 as k\to\infty; on the other hand, when \lambda\in\mathbb R and \mu>0 arbitrary, then there exists a sequence \left\{\tilde{u}_k\right\} of solutions with positive and unbounded energy.   Also, associated with the p-Laplacian equation -\Delta_p\,u=0, the exterior p-harmonic Steklov eigenvalue problems are described.
