In this paper, we consider a wider class of simulation functions and present some coincidence and common fixed point results in metric spaces. Results obtained in this paper extend, generalize and unify some well-known fixed and common fixed point results. Some illustrative examples are presented. We also discuss some applications to system of integral equations and functional equations arising in dynamic programming.
