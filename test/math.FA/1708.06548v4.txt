In this paper, we first show that for a Banach space X there is a fully order reversing mapping T from {\rm conv}(X) (the cone of all extended real-valued lower semicontinuous proper convex functions defined on X) onto itself if and only if X is reflexive and linearly isomorphic to its dual X^*. Then we further prove the following generalized ``Artstein-Avidan-Milman'' representation theorem: For every fully order reversing mapping T:{\rm conv}(X)\rightarrow {\rm conv}(X) there exist a linear isomorphism U:X\rightarrow X^*, x_0^*, \;\varphi_0\in X^*, \alpha>0 and r_0\in\mathbb R so that \begin{equation}\nonumber (Tf)(x)=\alpha(\mathcal Ff)(Ux+x^*_0)+\langle\varphi_0,x\rangle+r_0,\;\;\forall x\in X, \end{equation} where \mathcal F: {\rm conv}(X)\rightarrow {\rm conv}(X^*) is the Fenchel transform. Hence, these resolve two open questions. We also show several representation theorems of fully order preserving mappings defined on certain cones of convex functions. For example, for every fully order preserving mapping S:{\rm semn}(X)\rightarrow {\rm semn}(X) there is a linear isomorphism U:X\rightarrow X so that \begin{equation}\nonumber (Sf)(x)=f(Ux),\;\;\forall f\in{\rm semn}(X),\;x\in X, \end{equation} where {\rm semn}(X) is the cone of all lower semicontinuous seminorms on X.
