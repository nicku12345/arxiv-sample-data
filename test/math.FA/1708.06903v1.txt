In this paper we'll give a connection between four competing interactions (external field, nearest neighbor, second neighbors and triples of neighbors) of models with uncountable (i.e. [0,1]) set of spin values on the Cayley tree of order two and Lyapunov integral equation. Also we'll study fixed points of Lyapunov operator with degenerate kernel which each fixed point of the operator is correspond to a {\it translation-invariant} Gibbs measure.
