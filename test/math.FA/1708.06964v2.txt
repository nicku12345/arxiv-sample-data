Let \Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^m be an open, connected and bounded set and \mathcal{A}(\Omega) be a function algebra of holomorphic functions on \Omega. In this article we study quotient Hilbert modules obtained from submodules, consisting of functions in \mathcal{M} vanishing to order k along a smooth irreducible complex analytic set \mathcal{Z}\subset\Omega of codimension at least 2, of a quasi-free Hilbert module, \mathcal{M}. Our motive is to investigate unitary invariants of such quotient modules. We completely determine unitary equivalence of aforementioned quotient modules and relate it to geometric invariants of a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles. Then, as an application, we characterize unitary equivalence classes of weighted Bergman modules over \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}^m) in terms of those of quotient modules arising from the submodules of functions vanishing to order 2 along the diagonal in \mathbb{D}^m.
