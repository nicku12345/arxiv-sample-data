In this paper we characterize the closed subspaces of L^2(\mathcal{F}) that reduce the operators of the form E^{\mathcal{A}}M_u, in which \mathcal{A} is a \sigma- subalgebra of \mathcal{F}. We show that L^2(A) reduces E^{\mathcal{A}}M_u if and only if E^{\mathcal{A}}(\chi_A)=\chi_A on the support of E^{\mathcal{A}}(|u|^2), where A\in \mathcal{F}. Also, some necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for L^2(\mathcal{B}) to reduces E^{\mathcal{A}}M_u, for the \sigma- subalgebra \mathcal{B} of \mathcal{F}.
