We consider Banach spaces equipped with a set of strongly continuous bounded semigroups satisfying certain conditions. Using these semigroups we introduce an analog of a modulus of continuity and define analogs of Besov norms. A generalization of a classical interpolation theorem is proven in which the role of Sobolev spaces is played by subspaces defined in terms of infinitesimal operators of these semigroups. We show that our assumptions about a given set of semigroups are satisfied in the case of a strongly continuous bounded representation of a Lie group. In the case of a unitary representation in a Hilbert space we consider an analog of the Laplace operator and use it to define Paley-Wiener vectors. It allows us to develop a generalization of the Shannon-type sampling in Paley-Wiener subspaces and to construct Paley-Wiener nearly Parseval frames in the entire Hilbert space. It is shown that Besov spaces defined previously in terms of the modulus of continuity can be described in terms of approximation by Paley-Wiener vectors and also in terms of the frame coefficients. Throughout the paper we extensively use theory of interpolation and approximation spaces. The paper ends with applications of our results to function spaces on homogeneous manifolds.
