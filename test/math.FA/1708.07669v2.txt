For q\in(0,1), let B_q denote the limit q-Bernstein operator. In this paper, the distance between B_q and B_r for distinct q and r in the operator norm on C[0,1] is estimated, and it is proved that 1\leqslant \|B_q-B_r\|\leqslant 2, where both of the equalities can be attained. To elaborate more, the distance depends on whether or not r and q are rational powers of each other. For example, if r^j\neq q^m for all j,m\in \mathbb{N}, then \|B_q-B_r\|=2, and if r=q^m, m\in \mathbb{N}, then \|B_q-B_r\|=2(m-1)/m.
