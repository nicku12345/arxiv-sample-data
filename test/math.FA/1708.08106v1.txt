To prove by probabilistic methods that every (n-1)-dimensional section of the unit cube in R^n has volume at most \sqrt 2, K. Ball made essential use of the inequality  \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(\frac{\sin^2 t}{t^2}\right)^pdt\leq \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt p}, \quad p\geq 1,  in which equality holds if and only if p=1.   The right side of above inequality has the correct rate of decay though the limit of the ratio of the right to left side is {\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi}}} rather then \sqrt 2. Applying Ball's methods we put all of this into the improved form of the Ball's inequality.
