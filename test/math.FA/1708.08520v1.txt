In this paper, we investigate the wavelet coefficients for function spaces \mathcal{A}_k^p=\{f: \|(i \omega)^k\hat{f}(\omega)\|_p\leq 1\}, k\in N, p\in(1,\infty) using an important quantity C_{k,p}(\psi). In particular, Bernstein type inequalities associated with wavelets are established. We obtained a sharp inequality of Bernstein type for splines, which induces a lower bound for the quantity C_{k,p}(\psi) with \psi being the semiorthogonal spline wavelets. We also study the asymptotic behavior of wavelet coefficients for both the family of Daubechies orthonormal wavelets and the family of semiorthogonal spline wavelets. Comparison of these two families is done by using the quantity C_{k,p}(\psi).
