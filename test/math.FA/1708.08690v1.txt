In this paper, we introduce the notion of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for numerical radius (BPBp-\nu) for a subclass of the space of bounded linear operators. Then, we show that certain subspaces of \mathcal{L}(L_1(\mu)) have the BPBp-\nu for every finite measure \mu . As a consequence we deduce that the subspaces of finite-rank operators, compact operators and weakly compact operators on L_1(\mu) have the BPBp-\nu.
