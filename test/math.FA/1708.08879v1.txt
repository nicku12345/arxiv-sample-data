Equi-chordal and equi-isoclinic tight fusion frames (ECTFFs and EITFFs) are both types of optimal packings of subspaces in Euclidean spaces. In the special case where these subspaces are one-dimensional, ECTFFs and EITFFs both correspond to types of optimal packings of lines known as equiangular tight frames. In this brief note, we review some of the fundamental ideas and results concerning ECTFFs and EITFFs.
