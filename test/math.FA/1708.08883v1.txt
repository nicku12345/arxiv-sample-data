Suppose that Q is a family of seminorms on a locally convex space E which determines the topology of E. We study the existence of Q-nonexpansive retractions for families of Q-nonexpansive mappings and prove that a separated and sequentially complete locally convex space E that has the weak fixed point property, has the weak fixed point property for commuting separable semitopological semigroups of Q-nonexpansive mappings. This proves the Bruck's problem [5] for locally convex spaces. Moreover, we prove the existence of Q-nonexpansive retractions for the right amenable Q-nonexpansive semigroups.
