We establish sharp affine weighted L^p Sobolev type inequalities by using the L_p Busemann-Petty centroid inequality proved by Lutwak, Yang and Zhang. Our approach consists in combining in a convenient way the latter one with a suitable family of sharp weighted L^p Sobolev type inequalities obtained by Nguyen and allows to characterize all extremizers in some cases. The new inequalities don't rely on any euclidean geometric structure.
