We prove that the bidual of a Beurling algebra on \mathbb{Z}, considered as a Banach algebra with the first Arens product, can never be semisimple. We then show that {\rm rad\,}(\ell^{\, 1}(\oplus_{i=1}^\infty \mathbb{Z})") contains nilpotent elements of every index. Each of these results settles a question of Dales and Lau. Finally we show that there exists a weight \omega on \mathbb{Z} such that the bidual of \ell^{\, 1}(\mathbb{Z}, \omega) contains a radical element which is not nilpotent.
