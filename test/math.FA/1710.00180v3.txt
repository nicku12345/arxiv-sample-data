D. Bures defined a metric \beta  on states of a C^*-algebra and this concept has been generalized to unital completely positive maps \phi : \mathcal A \to \mathcal B, where \mathcal B is either an injective C^*-algebra or a von Neumann algebra. We introduce a new distance \gamma  for the same classes of unital completely positive maps. We use in our definition the distance between representations on the same Hilbert C^*-module in contrast to the Bures metric which uses one representation and distinct vectors. This metric can be expressed in terms of a class of completely positive maps on free products of C^*-algebras and in this setting \gamma  looks like Wasserstein metric on probability measures. Surprisingly, when the range algebra \mathcal B is injective, \gamma  and \beta  are related by the following explicit formula: \beta ^2= 2-\sqrt{4- \gamma ^2} . A deep result of Choi and Li on constrained dilation is the main tool in proving this formula.
