In this paper, the concept of an N_{\theta}^{2} quasi-Cauchy sequence is introduced. We proved interesting theorems related to N_{\theta}^{2}-quasi-Cauchy sequences. A real valued function f defined on a subset A of \mathbb{R}, the set of real numbers, is N_{\theta}^{2} ward continuous on A if it preserves N_{\theta}^{2} quasi-Cauchy sequences of points in A, i.e. (f( \alpha_{k})) is an N_{\theta}^{2} quasi-Cauchy sequence whenever (\alpha_{k}) is an N_{\theta}^{2} quasi-Cauchy sequences of points in A, where a sequence (\alpha_{k}) is called N_{\theta}^{2} quasi-Cauchy if (\Delta^{2} \alpha_{k}) is an N_{\theta} quasi-Cauchy sequence where \Delta^{2}\alpha_{k}=\alpha_{k+2}-2\alpha_{k+1}+\alpha_{k} for each positive integer k.
