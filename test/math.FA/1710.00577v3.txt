Let {\mathscr A}(D) be an algebra of functions continuous in the disk D=\{z\in{\mathbb C}\,|\,\,\,|z|\leqslant 1\} and {\it holomorphic} into D. The well-known fact is that the set {\mathscr M} of its characters (homomorphisms {\mathscr A}(D)\to\mathbb C) is exhausted by the Dirac measures \{\delta_{z_0}\,|\,\,z_0\in D\} and a homeomorphism {\mathscr M}\cong D holds. We present a 3d analog of this classical result as follows.   Let B=\{x\in{\mathbb R}^3\,|\,\,|x|\leqslant 1\}. A quaternion field is a pair p=\{\alpha,u\} of a function \alpha and vector field u in the ball B. A field p is {\it harmonic} if \alpha, u are continuous in B and \nabla\alpha={\rm rot\,}u,\,{\rm div\,}u=0 holds into B. The space {\mathscr Q}(B) of such fields is not an algebra w.r.t. the relevant (point-wise quaternion) multiplication. However, it contains the commutative algebras {\mathscr A}_\omega(B)=\{p\in{\mathscr Q}(B)\,|\,\,\nabla_\omega\alpha=0,\,\nabla_\omega u=0\}\,\,(\omega\in S^2), each {\mathscr A}_\omega(B) being isometrically isomorphic to {\mathscr A}(D). This enables one to introduce a set {\mathscr M}^{\mathbb H} of the \mathbb H-valued linear functionals on {\mathscr Q}(B) ({\it \mathbb H-characters}), which are multiplicative on each {\mathscr A}_\omega(B), and prove that {\mathscr M}^{\mathbb H}=\{\delta^{\mathbb H}_{x_0}\,|\,\,x_0\in B\}\cong B, where \delta^{\mathbb H}_{x_0}(p)=p(x_0).
