In the present note we introduce tame functionals on Banach algebras. A functional f \in A^* on a Banach algebra A is tame if the naturally defined linear operator A \to A^*, a \mapsto f \cdot a factors through Rosenthal Banach spaces (i.e., not containing a copy of l_1). Replacing Rosenthal by reflexive we get a well known concept of weakly almost periodic functionals. So, always WAP(A) \subseteq Tame(A). We show that tame functionals on the group algebra l_1(G) are induced exactly by tame functions (in the sense of topological dynamics) on G for every discrete group G. That is, Tame(l_1(G))=Tame(G). Many interesting tame functions on groups come from dynamical systems theory. Recall that WAP(L_1(G))=WAP(G) (Lau 1977, \"{U}lger 1986) for every locally compact group G. It is an open question if Tame(L_1(G))=Tame(G) holds for (nondiscrete) locally compact groups.
