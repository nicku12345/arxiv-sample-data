In 1963 Gr\"unbaum introduced a following variation of the Banach-Mazur distance for arbitrary convex bodies K, L \subset \mathbb{R}^n: d_G(K, L) = \inf \{ |r| \ : \ K' \subset L' \subset rK' \} with the infimum taken over all non-degenerate affine images K' and L' of K and L respectively. In 2004 Gordon, Litvak, Meyer and Pajor proved that the maximal possible distance is equal to n, confirming the conjecture of Gr\"unbaum. In 2011 Jim\'{e}nez and Nasz\'{o}di asked if the equality d_G(K, L)=n implies that K or L is a simplex and they proved it under the additional assumption that one of the bodies is smooth or strictly convex. The aim of the paper is to give a stability result for a smooth case of the theorem of Jim\'{e}nez and Nasz\'{o}di. We prove that for each smooth convex body L there exists \varepsilon_0(L)>0 such that if d_G(K, L) \geq (1-\varepsilon)n for some 0 \leq \varepsilon \leq \varepsilon_0(L), then d_G(K, S_n) \leq 1 + 40n^3r(\varepsilon), where S_n is the simplex in \mathbb{R}^n and r(\varepsilon) is a specific function of \varepsilon depending on the modulus of the convexity of the polar body of L. As a consequence we obtain that for arbitrary convex bodies K, L \subset \mathbb{R}^n their Banach-Mazur distance is less than n^2 - 2^{-22}n^{-7}.
