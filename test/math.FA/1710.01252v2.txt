We show that the non-compact generalised analytic Volterra operators T_g, where g \in \mathit{BMOA}, have the following structural rigidity property on the Hardy spaces H^p for 1 \le p < \infty and p \neq 2: if T_g is bounded below on an infinite-dimensional subspace M \subset H^p, then M contains a subspace linearly isomorphic to \ell^p. This implies in particular that any Volterra operator T_g\colon H^p \to H^p is \ell^2-singular for p \neq 2.
