The motive behind this manuscript is to set up the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution for a fractional thermostat model for certain values of the parameter \lambda>0. We accomplish sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive solution to the model, and afterwards formulate a non-trivial example to authenticate the grounds of our obtained results. Our findings are based on certain fixed point results of contractions depending on couple of altering distance functions \phi and \psi in the setting of Banach spaces that are discussed in this sequel.
