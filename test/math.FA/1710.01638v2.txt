In a previous work, the first named author described the set \cal P of all values of the Szlenk indices of separable Banach spaces. We complete this result by showing that for any integer n and any ordinal \alpha in \cal P, there exists a separable Banach space X such that the Szlenk of the dual of order k of X is equal to the first infinite ordinal \omega for all k in \{0,..,n-1\} and equal to \alpha for k=n. One of the ingredients is to show that the Lindenstrauss space and its dual both have a Szlenk index equal to \omega. We also show that any element of \cal P can be realized as a Szlenk index of a reflexive Banach space with an unconditional basis.
