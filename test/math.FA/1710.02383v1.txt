In this note some structural properties of grand variable exponent Lebesgue/ Morrey spaces over spaces of homogeneous type are obtained. In particular, it is proved that the closure of the class of bounded functions and the closure of classical Morrey space in grand variable exponent Morrey space coincide if the measure of the underlying space is finite. Moreover, we get two different characterizations of this class. Further, duality and preduality of grand variable exponent Lebesghue space defined on quasi-metric measure spaces with sigma-finite measure are obtained, which is new even when underlying measure is finite.
