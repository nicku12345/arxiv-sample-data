Several Koml\'os like properties in Banach lattices are investigated. We prove that C(K) fails the oo-pre-Koml\'os property, assuming that the compact Hausdorff space K has a nonempty separable open subset U without isolated points such that every u\in U has countable neighborhood base. We prove also that for any infinite dimensional Banach lattice E there is an unbounded convex uo-pre-Koml\'os set C\subseteq E_+ which is not uo-Koml\'os.
