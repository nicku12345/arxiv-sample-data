In this paper, we extend the concept of absolutely Ces\`aro boundedness to the fractional case. We construct a weighted shift operator belonging to this class of operators, and we prove that if T is an absolutely Ces\`{a}ro bounded operator of order \alpha with 0<\alpha\le 1, then \| T^n\|=o(n^{\alpha}), generalizing the result obtained for \alpha =1. Moreover, if \alpha > 1, then \|T^{n}\|= O(n). We apply such results to get stability properties for the Ces\`aro means of bounded operators.
