The notion of unboundedly order converges has been recieved recently a particular attention by several authors. The main result of the present paper shows that the notion is efficient and deserves that care. It states that a vector lattice is universally complete if and only if it is unboundedly order complete. Another notion of completeness will be treated is the notion of sup-completion introduced by Donner.
