In the first part of this paper we discuss the completeness of two general classes of weighted inductive limits of spaces of ultradifferentiable functions. In the second part we study their duals and characterize these spaces in terms of the growth of convolution averages of their elements. This characterization gives a canonical way to define a locally convex topology on these spaces and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be ultrabornological. In particular, our results apply to spaces of convolutors for Gelfand-Shilov spaces.
