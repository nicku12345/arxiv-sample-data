In this paper, we introduce a concept of statistically p-quasi-Cauchyness of a real sequence in the sense that a sequence (\alpha_{k}) is statistically p-quasi-Cauchy if \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}|\{k\leq n: |\alpha_{k+p}-\alpha_{k}|\geq{\varepsilon}\}|=0 for each \varepsilon>0. A function f is called statistically p-ward continuous on a subset A of the set of real umbers \mathbb{R} if it preserves statistically p-quasi-Cauchy sequences, i.e. the sequence f(\textbf{x})=(f(\alpha_{n})) is statistically p-quasi-Cauchy whenever \boldsymbol\alpha=(\alpha_{n}) is a statistically p-quasi-Cauchy sequence of points in A. It turns out that a real valued function f is uniformly continuous on a bounded subset A of \mathbb{R} if there exists a positive integer p such that f preserves statistically p-quasi-Cauchy sequences of points in A.
