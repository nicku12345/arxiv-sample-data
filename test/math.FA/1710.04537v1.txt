In this paper we discuss the structure of weighted weak Lebesgue spaces and weighted weak Orlicz spaces on \mathbb{R}^n. First, we present sufficient and necessary conditions for inclusion relation between weighted weak Lebesgue spaces. Next, we also obtain similar results on weighted weak Orlicz spaces. One of the keys to prove our results is to use the norm of the characteristic functions of the balls in \mathbb{R}^n.
