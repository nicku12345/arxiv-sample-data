Let A = U |A| be the polar decomposition of A. The Aluthge transform of the operator A, denoted by \tilde{A}, is defined as \tilde{A} =|A|^{\frac{1}{2}} U |A|^{\frac{1}{2}}. In this paper, first we generalize the definition of Aluthge transform for non-negative continuous functions f, g such that f(x)g(x)=x\,\,(x\geq0). Then, by using of this definition, we get some numerical radius inequalities. Among other inequalities, it is shown that if A is bounded linear operator on a complex Hilbert space {\mathscr H}, then   \begin{equation*} h\left( w(A)\right) \leq \frac{1}{4}\left\Vert h\left( g^{2}\left( \left\vert A\right\vert \right) \right) +h\left( f^{2}\left( \left\vert A\right\vert \right) \right) \right\Vert +\frac{1}{2}h\left( w\left( \tilde{A}_{f,g}\right) \right) , \end{equation*} where f, g are non-negative continuous functions such that f(x)g(x)=x\,\,(x\geq 0), h is a non-negative non-decreasing convex function on [0,\infty ) and \tilde{A}_{f,g} =f(|A|) U g(|A|).
