The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of self-cyclic maps, g-coupling and Banach type g-coupling which is the generalization of couplings introduced by Choudhury et al. In our main result we prove the existence theorem of coupled coincidence point for Banach type g-couplings which extends the results by Choudhury et al. We give an example in support of our result.
