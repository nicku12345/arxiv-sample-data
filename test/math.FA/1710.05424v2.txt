We consider densely defined sectorial operators A_\pm that can be written in the form A_\pm=\pm iS+V with \mathcal{D}(A_\pm)=\mathcal{D}(S)=\mathcal{D}(V), where both S and V\geq \varepsilon>0 are assumed to be symmetric. We develop an analog to the Birmin-Krein-Vishik-Grubb (BKVG) theory of selfadjoint extensions of a given strictly positive symmetric operator, where we will construct all maximally accretive extensions A_D of A_+ with the property that \overline{A_+}\subset A_D\subset A_-^*. Here, D is an auxiliary operator from \ker(A_-^*) to \ker(A_+^*) that parametrizes the different extensions A_D. After this, we will give a criterion for when the quadratic form \psi\mapsto\mbox{Re}\langle\psi,A_D\psi\rangle is closable and show that the selfadjoint operator \widehat{V} that corresponds to the closure is an extension of V. We will show how \widehat{V} depends on D, which --- using the classical BKVG-theory of selfadjoint extensions --- will allow us to define a partial order on the real parts of A_D depending on D. Applications to second order ordinary differential operators are discussed.
