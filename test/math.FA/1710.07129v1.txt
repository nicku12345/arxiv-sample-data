We prove a two-sided transference theorem between L^{p} spherical multipliers on the compact symmetric space U/K and L^{p} multipliers on the vector space i\mathfrak{p}, where the Lie algebra of U has Cartan decomposition \mathfrak{k\oplus }i\mathfrak{p}. This generalizes the classic theorem transference theorem of deLeeuw relating multipliers on % L^{p}(\mathbb{T)} and L^{p}(\mathbb{R)}.
