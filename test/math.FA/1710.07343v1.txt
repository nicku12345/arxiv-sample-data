The notion of fractional minimal rank of a partial matrix is introduced, a quantity that lies between the triangular minimal rank and the minimal rank of a partial matrix. The fractional minimal rank of partial matrices whose bipartite graph is a minimal cycle are determined. Along the way, we determine the minimal rank of a partial block matrix with invertible given entries that lie on a minimal cycle. Some open questions are stated.
