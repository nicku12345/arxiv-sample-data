Let G be a noncompact connected Lie group and \rho be the right Haar measure of G. Let X_1,...,X_q be a family of left invariant vector fields which satisfy H\"ormander's condition, and let \Delta=-\sum_{i=1}^qX_i^2 be the corresponding subLaplacian.   For 1\leq p<\infty and \alpha\geq 0 we define the Sobolev space L^p_{\alpha}(G)={f in L^p(\rho): \Delta^{\alpha/2}f\in L^p(\rho) }, endowed with the norm \|f\|_{\alpha,p}=\|f\|_{p}+\|\Delta^{\alpha/2}f\|_p, where we denote by \|f\|_p the norm of f in L^p(\rho).   In this paper we show that for all \alpha\geq 0 and p\in (1,\infty), the space L^{\infty}\cap L^p_{\alpha}(G) is an algebra under pointwise product. Such result was proved by T. Coulhon, E. Russ and V. Tardivel-Nachef in the case when G is unimodular. We shall prove it on Lie groups, thus extending their result to the nonunimodular case.   In order to prove our main result, we need to study the boundedness of local Riesz transforms R^c_J=X_J(cI+\Delta)^{-m/2}, where c>0, X_J=X_{j_1}...X_{j_m} and j_\ell \in\{1,\dots,q\} for \ell=1,...,m. We show that if c is sufficiently large, the Riesz transform R^c_J is bounded on L^p(\rho) for every p\in (1,\infty), and prove also appropriate endpoint results involving Hardy and BMO spaces.
