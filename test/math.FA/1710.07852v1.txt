In these notes, we study nonlinear embeddings between Banach spaces which are also weakly sequentially continuous. In particular, our main result implies that if a Banach space X coarsely (resp. uniformly) embeds into a Banach space Y by a weakly sequentially continuous map, then every spreading model (e_n)_n of a normalized weakly null sequence in X satisfies \[\|e_1+\ldots+e_k\|_{\overline{\delta}_Y}\lesssim\|e_1+\ldots+e_k\|_S,\] where \overline{\delta}_Y is the modulus of asymptotic uniform convexity of Y. Among other results, we obtain Banach spaces X and Y so that X coarsely (resp. uniformly) embeds into Y, but so that X cannot be mapped into Y by a weakly sequentially continuous coarse (resp. uniform) embedding.
