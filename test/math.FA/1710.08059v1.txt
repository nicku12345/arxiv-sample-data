Let \sg_i, i=1,\ldots,n, denote reverse doubling weights on \R^d, let \cdr(\R^d) denote the set of all dyadic rectangles on \R^d (Cartesian products of usual dyadic intervals) and let K:\,\cdr(\R^d)\to[0,\8) be a~map. In this paper we give the n-linear embedding theorem for dyadic rectangles. That is, we prove the n-linear embedding inequality for dyadic rectangles \[ \sum_{R\in\cdr(\R^d)} K(R)\prod_{i=1}^n\lt|\int_{R}f_i\,{\rm d}\sg_i\rt| \le C \prod_{i=1}^n \|f_i\|_{L^{p_i}(\sg_i)} \] can be characterized by simple testing condition \[ K(R)\prod_{i=1}^n\sg_i(R) \le C \prod_{i=1}^n\sg_i(R)^{\frac{1}{p_i}} \quad R\in\cdr(\R^d), \] in the range 1<p_i<\8 and \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{p_i}>1. As a~corollary to this theorem, for reverse doubling weights, we verify a~necessary and sufficient condition for which the weighted norm inequality for the multilinear strong positive dyadic operator and for strong fractional integral operator to hold.
