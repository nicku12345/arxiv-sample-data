Let n\ge 2 be the spatial dimension. The purpose of this note is to obtain some weighted estimates for the fractional maximal operator {\mathfrak M}{\alpha} of order \alpha, 0\le\alpha<n, on the weighted Choquet-Lorentz space L^{p,q}(H_{w}^{d}), where the weight w is arbitrary and the underlying measure is the weighted d-dimensional Hausdorff content H^{d}_{w}, 0<d\le n. Concerning a dependence of two parameters \alpha and d, we establish a general form of the Fefferman-Stein type inequalities for {\mathfrak M}_{\alpha}. Our results contain the works of Adams, \cite{Ad} and of Orobitg and Verdera \cite{OV} as the special cases. Our results also imply the Tang result \cite{Ta}, if we assume the weight w is in the Muckenhoupt A_{1}-class.
