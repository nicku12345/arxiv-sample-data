We prove that an overcomplete Gabor frame in  \ell^2(\mathbf Z) by a finitely supported sequence is always linearly dependent. This is a particular case of a general result about linear dependence versus independence for Gabor systems in \ell^2(\mathbf Z) with modulation parameter 1/M and translation parameter N for some M,N\in \mathbf N, and generated by a finite sequence g in \ell^2(\mathbf Z) with K nonzero entries.
