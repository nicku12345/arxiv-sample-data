We study a certain class \mathcal{P} of positive linear functionals \varphi on L^{\infty}([1,\infty)) for which \varphi(f) = \alpha if \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} \int_1^x f(t)dt = \alpha. It turns out that translations f(x) \mapsto f(rx) on L^{\infty}([1, \infty)), where r \in [1, \infty), which are induced by the action of the multiplicative semigroup [1, \infty) on itself, plays an intrinsic role in the study of \mathcal{P}. We also deal with an analogue \mathcal{K} of \mathcal{P} of positive linear functionals on L^{\infty}([0, \infty)) partaining to the action of the additive semigroup [0, \infty) on itself. In particular, we give some expressions of maximal possible values of \mathcal{P} and \mathcal{K} for a given function respectively.
