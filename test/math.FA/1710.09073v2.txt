It is known that the classical Banach--Stone theorem does not extend to the class of AC(\sigma) spaces of absolutely continuous functions defined on compact subsets of the complex plane. On the other hand, if \sigma is restricted to the set of compact polygons, then all the corresponding AC(\sigma) spaces are isomorphic. In this paper we examine the case where \sigma is the spectrum of a compact operator, and show that in this case one can obtain an infinite family of homeomorphic sets for which the corresponding function spaces are not isomorphic.
