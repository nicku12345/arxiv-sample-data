Let {\bf A} = (A_1, \dots, A_m) be an m-tuple of bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert space {\cal H}. Their joint (p,q)-matricial range \Lambda_{p,q}({\bf A}) is the collection of (B_1, \dots, B_m) \in {\bf M}_q^m, where I_p\otimes B_j is a compression of A_j on a pq-dimensional subspace. This definition covers various kinds of generalized numerical ranges for different values of p,q,m. In this paper, it is shown that \Lambda_{p,q}({\bf A}) is star-shaped if the dimension of \cal H is sufficiently large. If \dim {\cal H} is infinite, we extend the definition of \Lambda_{p,q}({\bf A}) to \Lambda_{\infty,q}({\bf A}) consisting of (B_1, \dots, B_m) \in {\bf M}_q^m such that I_\infty \otimes B_j is a compression of A_j on a closed subspace of {\cal H}, and consider the joint essential (p,q)-matricial range \Lambda^{ess}_{p,q}({\bf A}) = \bigcap \{ {\bf cl}(\Lambda_{p,q}(A_1+F_1, \dots, A_m+F_m)): F_1, \dots, F_m \hbox{ are compact operators}\}. Both sets are shown to be convex, and the latter one is always non-empty and compact.
