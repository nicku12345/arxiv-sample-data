Gavruta introduced K-frames for Hilbert spaces to study atomic systems with respect to a bounded linear operator. There are many differences between K-frames and standard frames, so we study weaving properties of K-frames. Two frames \{\phi_{i}\}_{i \in I} and \{\psi_{i}\}_{i \in I} for a separable Hilbert space \mathcal{H} are woven if there are positive constants A \leq B such that for every subset \sigma \subset I, the family \{\phi_{i}\}_{i \in \sigma} \cup \{\psi_{i}\}_{i \in \sigma^{c}} is a frame for \mathcal{H} with frame bounds A, B. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for weaving K-frames in Hilbert spaces. It is shown that woven K-frames and weakly woven K-frames are equivalent. Finally, sufficient conditions for Paley-Wiener type perturbation of weaving K-frames are given.
