The existence of unimodular forms with small norms on sequence spaces is crucial in a variety of problems in modern analysis. We prove that the infimum of \left\Vert A\right\Vert  over all unimodular d-linear (complex or real) forms A on \ell_{p_1}^{n_{1}} \times \cdots \times \ell_{p_d}^{n_{d}}, for all p_1,\dots,p_d \in [2, \infty] and all positive integers n_1,\dots,n_d, behaves (asymptotically) as \left(n_{1}^{1/2} + \cdots + n_{d}^{1/2}\right) \prod_{j=1}^{d}n_{j}^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p_j}}. Applications to the theory of the multilinear Hardy--Littlewood inequality are also presented.
