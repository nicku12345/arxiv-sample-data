We consider a continuous version of the classical notion of Banach limits, namely, positive linear functionals on L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}_+) invariant under translations f(x) \mapsto f(x+s) of L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}_+) for every s \ge 0. We give its characterization in terms of the invariance under the operation of a certain linear mapping on L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}_+). Applications to summability methods are provided in the last section.
