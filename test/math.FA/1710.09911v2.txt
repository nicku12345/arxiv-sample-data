The aim of this paper is to present a unified theory of many Kato type representation theorems in terms of solvable forms on Hilbert spaces. In particular, for some sesquilinear forms \Omega on a dense domain \mathcal{D} one looks for an expression    \Omega(\xi,\eta)=\langle T\xi , \eta\rangle, \qquad \forall \xi\in D(T),\eta \in \mathcal{D},    where T is a densely defined closed operator with domain D(T)\subseteq \mathcal{D}. There are two characteristic aspects of solvable forms. Namely, one is that the domain of the form can be turned into a reflexive Banach space need not be a Hilbert space. The second one is the existence of a perturbation with a bounded form which is not necessarily a multiple of the inner product.
