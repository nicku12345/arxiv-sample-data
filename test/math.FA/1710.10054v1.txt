In this research article, we discuss two topics. Firstly, we introduce SCC-Map and \phi-contraction type T-coupling. By using these two definitions, we generalize \phi-contraction type coupling given by H. Aydi et al. [3] to \phi-contraction type T-coupling and proved the existence theorem of coupled coincidence point for metric spaces which are not complete. Secondly, we attempt to give an answer to an open problem presented by choudhury et al. [7] concerning the investigation of fixed point and related properties for couplings satisfying other type of inequalities. In this direction we prove the existence and uniqueness theorem of strong coupled fixed point for (\phi,\psi)-contraction type coupling. We give examples to illustrate our main results.
