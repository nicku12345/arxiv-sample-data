In this article properties of the (b, c)-inverse, the inverse along an element, the outer inverse with prescribed range and null space A^{(2)}_{T, S} and the Moore-Penrose inverse will be studied in the contexts of Banach spaces operators, Banach algebras and C^*-algebras. The main properties to be considered are the continuity, the differentiability and the openness of the sets of all invertible elements defined by all the aforementioned outer inverses but the Moore-Penrose inverse. The relationship between the (b, c)-inverse and the outer inverse A^{(2)}_{T, S} will be also characterized.
