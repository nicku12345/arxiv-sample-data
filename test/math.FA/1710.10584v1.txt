Let m \geq 1 be an integer and let H_m(\mathbb B) be the analytic functional Hilbert space on the unit ball \mathbb B \subset \mathbb C^n given by the reproducing kernel K_m(z,w) = (1 - \langle z,w \rangle)^{-m}. We prove that Toeplitz operators with pluriharmonic symbol on H_m(\mathbb B) can be characterized by an algebraic identity which extends the classical Brown-Halmos characterization of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space of the unit disc as well as corresponding results of Louhichi and Olofsson for Toeplitz operators with harmonic symbol on weighted Bergman spaces of the disc.
