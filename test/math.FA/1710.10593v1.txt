We prove decay rates for a vector-valued function f of a non-negative real variable with bounded weak derivative, under rather general conditions on the Laplace transform \hat{f}. This generalizes results of Batty-Duyckaerts (2008) and other authors in later publications. Besides the possibility of \hat{f} having a singularity of logarithmic type at zero, one novelty in our paper is that we assume \hat{f} to extend to a domain to the left of the imaginary axis, depending on a non-decreasing function M and satisfying a growth assumption with respect to a different non-decreasing function K. The decay rate is expressed in terms of M and K. We prove that the obtained decay rates are essentially optimal for a very large class of functions M and K. Finally we explain in detail how our main result improves known decay rates for the local energy of waves on exterior domains.
