Let \mathbf{T} be a pair of commuting hyponormal operators satisfying the so-called quasitriangular property  \textrm{dim} \; \textrm{ker} \; (\mathbf{T}-\boldsymbol\lambda) \ge \textrm{dim} \; \textrm{ker} \; (\mathbf{T} - {\boldsymbol\lambda})^*),  for every \boldsymbol\lambda in the Taylor spectrum \sigma(\mathbf{T}) of \mathbf{T}. We prove that the Weyl spectrum of \mathbf{T}, \omega(\mathbf{T}), satisfies the identity  \omega(\mathbf{T})=\sigma(\mathbf{T}) \setminus \pi_{00}(\mathbf{T}),  where \pi_{00}(\mathbf{T}) denotes the set of isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity.   Our method of proof relies on a (strictly 2-variable) fact about the topological boundary of the Taylor spectrum; as a result, our proof does not hold for d-tuples of commuting hyponormal operators with d>2.
