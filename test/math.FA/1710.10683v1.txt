We say that a weighted shift W_\alpha with (positive) weight sequence \alpha: \alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots is {\it moment infinitely divisible} (MID) if, for every t > 0, the shift with weight sequence \alpha^t: \alpha_0^t, \alpha_1^t, \ldots is subnormal. \ Assume that W_{\alpha} is a contraction, i.e., 0 < \alpha_i \le 1 for all i \ge 0. \ We show that such a shift W_\alpha is MID if and only if the sequence \alpha is log completely alternating. \ This enables the recapture or improvement of some previous results proved rather differently. \ We derive in particular new conditions sufficient for subnormality of a weighted shift, and each example contains implicitly an example or family of infinitely divisible Hankel matrices, many of which appear to be new.
