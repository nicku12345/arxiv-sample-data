Let S be a pure bounded rationally multicyclic subnormal operator on a separable complex Hilbert space \mathcal H and let M_z be the minimal normal extension on a separable complex Hilbert space \mathcal K containing \mathcal H. Let bpe(S) be the set of bounded point evaluations and let abpe(S) be the set of analytic bounded point evaluations. We show abpe(S) = bpe(S) \cap Int(\sigma (S)). The result affirmatively answers a question asked by J. B. Conway concerning the equality of the interior of bpe(S) and abpe(S) for a rationally multicyclic subnormal operator S. As a result, if \lambda_0\in Int(\sigma (S)) and dim(ker(S-\lambda_0)^*) = N, where N is the minimal number of cyclic vectors for S, then the range of S-\lambda_0 is closed, hence, \lambda_0 \in \sigma (S) \setminus \sigma_e (S).
