Let \nu be a finite complex measure with support in \bar {\mathbb D} and let \mathcal C\nu denote the Cauchy transform of \nu . Suppose that \nu annihilates polynomials in complex variable z and \nu |_{\partial \mathbb D} = hm, where m is the normalized Lebesgue measure on \partial {\mathbb D}. We show that, for \epsilon_0 > 0, m-almost all e^{i\theta}\in \partial {\mathbb D}, and a > 0, when r tends to 1, there exists E_r \subset B(re^{i\theta}, \frac{1-r}{4}) with analytic capacity \gamma (E_r) < \epsilon_0 \frac{1-r}{4} such that   |\mathcal C\nu (\lambda) - e^{-i\theta}h(e^{i\theta}) | \le a area-almost all \lambda \in B (re^{i\theta}, \frac{1-r}{4} ) \setminus E_r . Using this result, we provide an alternative proof of Aleman-Richter-Sundberg's Theorem on nontangential limits in P^t(\mu )-Spaces and the index of invariant subspaces.
