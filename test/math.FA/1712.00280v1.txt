It is shown that the monomials \Lambda=(z^n)_{n=0}^{\infty} are a Schauder basis of the Fr\'echet spaces A_+^{-\gamma}, \ \gamma \geq 0, that consists of all the analytic functions f on the unit disc such that (1-|z|)^{\mu}|f(z)| is bounded for all \mu > \gamma. Lusky \cite{L} proved that \Lambda is not a Schauder basis for the closure of the polynomials in weighted Banach spaces of analytic functions of type H^{\infty}. A sequence space representation of the Fr\'echet space A_+^{-\gamma} is presented. The case of (LB)-spaces A_{-}^{-\gamma}, \ \gamma > 0, that are defined as unions of weighted Banach spaces is also studied.
