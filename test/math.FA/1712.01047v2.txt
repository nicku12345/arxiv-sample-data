In this paper, we study a newly developed shearlet system on bounded domains which yields frames for H^s(\Omega) for some s\in \mathbb{N}, \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2. We will derive approximation rates with respect to H^s(\Omega) norms for functions whose derivatives admit smooth jumps along curves and demonstrate superior rates to those provided by pure wavelet systems. These improved approximation rates demonstrate the potential of the novel shearlet system for the discretization of partial differential equations. Therefore, we implement an adaptive shearlet-based algorithm for the solution of an elliptic PDE and analyze its computational complexity and convergence properties.
