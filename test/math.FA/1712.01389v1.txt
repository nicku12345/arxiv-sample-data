Let PQC stand for the set of all piecewise quasicontionus function on the unit circle, i.e., the smallest closed subalgebra of L^\infty(\mathbb{T}) which contains the classes of all piecewise continuous function PC and all quasicontinuous functions QC=(C+H^\infty)\cap(C+\overline{H^\infty}). We analyze the fibers of the maximal ideal spaces M(PQC) and M(QC) over maximal ideals from M(\widetilde{QC}), where \widetilde{QC} stands for the C^*-algebra of all even quasicontinous functions. The maximal ideal space M(\widetilde{QC}) is decribed and partitioned into various subsets corresponding to different descriptions of the fibers.
