We introduce a new class \mathcal{FV}(\Omega,E) of spaces of weighted functions on a set \Omega with values in a locally convex Hausdorff space E which covers many classical spaces of vector-valued functions like continuous, smooth, holomorphic or harmonic functions. Then we exploit the construction of \mathcal{FV}(\Omega,E) to derive sufficient conditions such that \mathcal{FV}(\Omega,E) can be linearised, i.e. that \mathcal{FV}(\Omega,E) is topologically isomorphic to the \varepsilon-product \mathcal{FV}(\Omega)\varepsilon E where \mathcal{FV}(\Omega):=\mathcal{FV}(\Omega,\mathbb{K}) and \mathbb{K} is the scalar field of E.
