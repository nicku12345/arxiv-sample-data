We study Toeplitz operators with respect to a commuting n-tuple of bounded operators which satisfies some additional conditions coming from complex geometry. Then we consider a particular such tuple on a function space. The algebra of Toeplitz operators with respect to that particular tuple becomes naturally homeomorphic to L^\infty of a certain compact subset of \mathbb C^n. Dual Toeplitz operators are characterized. En route, we prove an extension type theorem which is not only important for studying Toeplitz operators, but also has an independent interest because dilation theorems do not hold in general for n>2.
