In order to study Li-Yorke chaos by the scalar perturbation for a given bounded linear operator T on Banach spaces X, we introduce the Li-Yorke chaos translation set of T, which is defined by S_{LY}(T)=\{\lambda\in\mathbb{C};\lambda+T \text{ is Li-Yorke chaotic}\}. In this paper, some operator classes are considered, such as normal operator, compact operator, shift and so on. In particular, we show that the Li-Yorke chaos translation set of Kalisch operator on Hilbert space \mathcal{L}^2[0,2\pi] is a simple point set \{0\}.
