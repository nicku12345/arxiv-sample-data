In the practice, time variable cannot be negative. The space L^2(\Bbb R_+) of square integrable functions defined on the right half real line \Bbb R_+ models causal signal space. This paper focuses on a class of dilation-and-modulation systems in L^2(\Bbb R_+). The density theorem for Gabor systems in L^2(\Bbb R) states a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of complete Gabor systems or Gabor frames in L^2(\Bbb R) in terms of the index set alone-independently of window functions. The space L^2(\Bbb R_+) admits no nontrivial Gabor system since \Bbb R_+ is not a group according to the usual addition. In this paper, we introduce a class of dilation-and-modulation systems in L^2(\Bbb R_+) and the notion of \Theta-transform matrix. Using \Theta-transform matrix method we obtain the density theorem of the dilation-and-modulation systems in L^2(\Bbb R_+) under the condition that \log_ba is a positive rational number, where a and b are the dilation and modulation parameters respectively. Precisely, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a complete dilation-and-modulation system or dilation-and-modulation system frame in L^2(\Bbb R_+) is that \log_ba \leq 1. Simultaneously, we obtain a \Theta-transform matrix-based expression of all complete dilation-and-modulation systems and all dilation-and-modulation system frames in L^2(\Bbb R_+).
