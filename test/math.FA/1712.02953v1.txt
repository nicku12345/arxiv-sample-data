For 1 \le t < \infty , a compact subset K of the complex plane \mathbb C, and a finite positive measure \mu supported on K, R^t(K, \mu) denotes the closure in L^t (\mu ) of rational functions with poles off K. The paper examines the boundary values of functions in R^t(K, \mu) for certain compact subset K and extends the work of Aleman, Richter, and Sundberg on nontangential limits for the closure in L^t (\mu ) of analytic polynomials (Theorem A and Theorem C in \cite{ars}). We show that the Cauchy transform of an annihilating measure has some continuity properties in the sense of capacitary density. This allows us to extend Aleman, Richter, and Sundberg's results for R^t(K, \mu) and provide alternative short proofs of their theorems as special cases.
