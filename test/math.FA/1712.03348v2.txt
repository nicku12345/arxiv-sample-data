In this paper, on \mathbb{D} we define Cowen-Douglas function introduced by Cowen-Douglas operator M_\phi^* on Hardy space \mathcal{H}^2(\mathbb{D}) and we give a sufficient condition for Cowen-Douglas function, where \phi\in\mathcal{H}^\infty(\mathbb{D}). Moreover, we give some applications of Cowen-Douglas function on chaos, such as application on the inverse chaos problem for \phi(T), where \phi is a Cowen-Douglas function and T is the backward shift operator on \mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb{N}).
