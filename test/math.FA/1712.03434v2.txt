In this paper we intend to introduce the concept of c-K-g-frames, which are the generalization of K-g-frames. In addition, we prove some new results on c-K-g-frames on Hilbert spaces. Moreover, we define the related oprators of c-K-g frames. Then, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on c-K-frames to characterize them. Finally, we verify perturbation of c-K-g-frames.
