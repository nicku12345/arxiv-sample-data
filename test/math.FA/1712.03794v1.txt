We introduce generalized multipliers for left-invertible analytic operators. We show that they form a Banach algebra and characterize the commutant of such operators in its terms. In the special case, we describe the commutant of balanced weighted shift only in terms of its weights. In addition, we prove two independent criteria for reflexivity of weighted shifts on directed trees.
