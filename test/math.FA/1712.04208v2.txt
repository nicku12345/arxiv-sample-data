We introduce asymptotic analogues of the Rademacher and martingale type and cotype of Banach spaces and operators acting on them. Some classical local theory results related, for example, to the `automatic-type' phenomenon, the type-cotype duality, or the Maurey-Pisier theorem, are extended to the asymptotic setting. We also investigate operator ideals corresponding to the asymptotic subtype/subcotype. As an application of this theory, we provide a sharp version of a result of Brooker and Lancien by showing that any twisted sum of Banach spaces with Szlenk power types p and q has Szlenk power type \max\{p,q\}.
