In this paper we introduce two new classes of operators that we call strongly order continuous and strongly \sigma-order continuous operators. An operator T:E\rightarrow F between two Riesz spaces is said to be strongly order continuous (resp. strongly \sigma-order continuous), if x _\alpha \xrightarrow{uo}0 (resp. x _n \xrightarrow{uo}0) in E implies Tx _\alpha \xrightarrow{o}0 (resp. Tx _n \xrightarrow{o}0) in F. We give some conditions under which order continuity will be equivalent to strongly order continuity of operators on Riesz spaces. We show that the collection of all so-continuous linear functionals on a Riesz space E is a band of E^\sim.
