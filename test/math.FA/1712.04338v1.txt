We deduce one-parameter group properties for pseudo-differential operators \operatorname{Op} (a), where a belongs to the class \Gamma ^{(\omega _0)}_* of certain Gevrey symbols. We use this to show that there are pseudo-differential operators \operatorname{Op} (a) and \operatorname{Op} (b) which are inverses to each others, where a\in \Gamma ^{(\omega _0)}_* and b\in \Gamma ^{(1/\omega _0)}_*.   We apply these results to deduce lifting property for modulation spaces and construct explicit isomorpisms between them. For each weight functions \omega ,\omega _0 moderated by GRS submultiplicative weights, we prove that the Toeplitz operator (or localization operator) \operatorname{Tp} (\omega _0) is an isomorphism from M^{p,q}_{(\omega )} onto M^{p,q}_{(\omega /\omega _0)} for every p,q \in (0,\infty ].
