A multiplicative Hankel operator is an operator with matrix representation M(\alpha) = \{\alpha(nm)\}_{n,m=1}^\infty, where \alpha is the generating sequence of M(\alpha). Let \mathcal{M} and \mathcal{M}_0 denote the spaces of bounded and compact multiplicative Hankel operators, respectively. In this note it is shown that the distance from an operator M(\alpha) \in \mathcal{M} to the compact operators is minimized by a nonunique compact multiplicative Hankel operator N(\beta) \in \mathcal{M}_0, \|M(\alpha) - N(\beta)\|_{\mathcal{B}(\ell^2(\mathbb{N}))} = \inf \left \{\|M(\alpha) - K \|_{\mathcal{B}(\ell^2(\mathbb{N}))} \, : \, K \colon \ell^2(\mathbb{N}) \to \ell^2(\mathbb{N}) \textrm{ compact} \right\}. Intimately connected with this result, it is then proven that the bidual of \mathcal{M}_0 is isometrically isomorphic to \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{M}_0^{\ast \ast} \simeq \mathcal{M}. It follows that \mathcal{M}_0 is an M-ideal in \mathcal{M}. The dual space \mathcal{M}_0^\ast is isometrically isomorphic to a projective tensor product with respect to Dirichlet convolution. The stated results are also valid for small Hankel operators on the Hardy space H^2(\mathbb{D}^d) of a finite polydisk.
