Suppose that A is a semi-simple and commutative Banach algebra. In this paper we try to characterize the character space of the Banach algebra C_{\rm{BSE}}(\Delta(A)) consisting of all BSE-functions on \Delta(A) where \Delta(A) denotes the character space of A. Indeed, in the case that A=C_0(X) where X is a non-empty locally compact Hausdroff space, we give a complete characterization of \Delta(C_{\rm{BSE}}(\Delta(A))) and in the general case we give a partial answer. Also, using the Fourier algebra, we show that C_{\rm{BSE}}(\Delta(A)) is not a C^*-algebra in general. Finally for some subsets E of A^*, we define the subspace of BSE-like functions on \Delta(A)\cup E and give a nice application of this space related to Goldstine's theorem.
