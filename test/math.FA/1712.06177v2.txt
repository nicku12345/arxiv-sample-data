If A is an algebra with finite right global dimension, then for any automorphism \alpha and \alpha-derivation \delta the right global dimension of A[t; \alpha, \delta] satisfies \[   \text{rgld} \, A \le \text{rgld} \, A[t; \alpha, \delta] \le \text{rgld} \, A + 1. \] We extend this result to the case of holomorphic Ore extensions and smooth crossed products by \mathbb{Z} of \hat{\otimes}-algebras.
