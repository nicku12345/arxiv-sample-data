For an Arens-Michael algebra A we consider a class of A-\hat{\otimes}-bimodules which are invertible with respect to the projective bimodule tensor product. We call such bimodules topologically invertible over A. Given a Fr\'echet-Arens-Michael algebra A and an topologically invertible Fr\'echet A-\hat{\otimes}-bimodule M, we construct an Arens-Michael algebra \widehat{L}_A(M) which serves as a topological version of the Laurent tensor algebra L_A(M).   Also, for a fixed algebra B we provide a condition on an invertible B-bimodule N sufficient for the Arens-Michael envelope of L_B(N) to be isomorphic to \widehat{L}_{\widehat{B}}(\widehat{N}). In particular, we prove that the Arens-Michael envelope of an invertible Ore extension A[x, x^{-1}; \alpha] is isomorphic to \widehat{L}_{\widehat{A}}(\widehat{A}_{\widehat{\alpha}}) provided that the Arens-Michael envelope of A is metrizable.
