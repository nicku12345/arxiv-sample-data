In this paper, we introduce the notion of k^{th}-order slant little Hankel operator on the Bergman space with essentially bounded harmonic symbols on the unit disc and obtain its algebraic and spectral properties. We have also discussed the conditions under which k^{th}-order slant little Hankel operators commute.
