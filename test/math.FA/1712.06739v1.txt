The paper is devoted to frame expansions in Fr\'echet spaces. First we review some results which concern series expansions in general Fr\'echet spaces via Fr\'echet and General Fr\'echet frames. Then we present some new results on series expansions of tempered distributions and ultradistributions, and the corresponding test functions, via localized frames and coefficients in appropriate sequence spaces.
