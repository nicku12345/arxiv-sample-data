For a power bounded or polynomially bounded operator T sufficient conditions for the existence of a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace are given. The obtained hyperinvariant subspaces of T have the form of the closure of the range of \varphi(T). Here \varphi is a singular inner function, if T is polynomially bounded, or \varphi is an analytic in the unit disc function with absolutely summable Taylor coefficients and singular inner part, if T is supposed to be power bounded only.   Also, an example of a quasianalytic contraction T is given. The quasianalytic spectral set of T is not the whole unit circle \mathbb T, while \sigma(T)=\mathbb T. Proofs are based on results by Esterle, Kellay, Borichev and Volberg.
