We investigate the following property for Banach spaces. A Banach space X satisfies the Uniform Approximation on Large Subspaces (UALS) if there exists C>0 with the following property: for any A\in\mathcal{L}(X) and convex compact subset W of \mathcal{L}(X) for which there exists \varepsilon>0 such that for every x\in X there exists B\in W with \|A(x)-B(x)\|\le\varepsilon\|x\|, there exists a subspace Y of X of finite codimension and a B\in W with \|(A-B)|_Y\|_{\mathcal{L}(Y,X)}\leq C\varepsilon. We prove that a class of separable Banach spaces including \ell_p, for 1\le p< \infty, and C(K), for K countable and compact, satisfy the UALS. On the other hand every L_p[0,1], for 1\le p\le \infty and p\neq2, fails the property and the same holds for C(K), where K is an uncountable metrizable compact space. Our sufficient conditions for UALS are based on joint spreading models, a multidimensional extension of the classical concept of spreading model, introduced and studied in the present paper.
