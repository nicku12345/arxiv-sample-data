Let p be a positive number and h a function on \mathbb{R}^+ satisfying h(xy) \ge h(x) h(y) for any x, y \in \mathbb{R}^+. A non-negative continuous function f on K (\subset \mathbb{R}^+) is said to be {\it operator (p,h)-convex} if \begin{equation*}\label{def} f ([\alpha A^p + (1-\alpha)B^p]^{1/p}) \leq h(\alpha)f(A) +h(1-\alpha)f(B) \end{equation*} holds for all positive semidefinite matrices A, B of order n with spectra in K, and for any \alpha \in (0,1).   In this paper, we study properties of operator (p,h)-convex functions and prove the Jensen, Hansen-Pedersen type inequalities for them. We also give some equivalent conditions for a function to become an operator (p,h)-convex. In applications, we obtain Choi-Davis-Jensen type inequality for operator (p,h)-convex functions and a relation between operator (p,h)-convex functions with operator monotone functions.
