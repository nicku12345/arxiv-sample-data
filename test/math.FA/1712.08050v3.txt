A definition of frames in Krein spaces is proposed which extends the concept of J-frames defined by J.I. Giribet et al., J. Math. Anal. Appl. {\textbf{393}} (2012), 122-137. The principal difference consists in the fact that a J-frame is related to maximal definite subspaces \mathcal{M}_\pm which are not assumed to be uniformly definite. The latter allows one to extend the collection of J-frames. In particular, some complete J-orthogonal sequences and J-orthogonal Schauder bases can be interpreted as J-frames.
