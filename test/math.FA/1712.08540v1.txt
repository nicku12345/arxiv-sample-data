Let X be a completely regular topological space. We study closed ideals H of C_B(X), the normed algebra of bounded continuous scalar-valued mappings on X equipped with pointwise addition and multiplication and the supremum norm, which are non-vanishing, in the sense that, there is no point of X at which every element of H vanishes. This is done by studying the (unique) locally compact Hausdorff space Y associated to H in such a way that H and C_0(Y) are isometrically isomorphic. We are interested in various connectedness properties of Y. In particular, we present necessary and sufficient (algebraic) conditions for H such that Y satisfies (topological) properties such as locally connectedness, total disconnectedness, zero-dimensionality, strong zero-dimensionality, total separatedness or extremal disconnectedness.
