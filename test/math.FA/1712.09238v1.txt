In this article, we investigate the bilinear Riesz means S^{\alpha } associated to the sublaplacian on the Heisenberg group. We prove that the operator S^{\alpha } is bounded from L^{p_{1}}\times L^{p_{2}} into  L^{p} for 1\leq p_{1}, p_{2}\leq \infty  and 1/p=1/p_{1}+1/p_{2} when  \alpha  is large than a suitable smoothness index \alpha (p_{1},p_{2}). There are some essential differences between the Euclidean space and the Heisenberg group for studying the bilinear Riesz means problem. We make use of some special techniques to obtain a lower index \alpha (p_{1},p_{2}).
