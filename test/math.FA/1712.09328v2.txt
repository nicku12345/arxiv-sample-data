We prove that Krivine's Function Calculus is compatible with integration. Let (\Omega,\Sigma,\mu) be a finite measure space, X a Banach lattice, x\in X^n, and f\colon\mathbb R^n\times\Omega\to\mathbb R a function such that f(\cdot,\omega) is continuous and positively homogeneous for every \omega\in\Omega, and f(s,\cdot) is integrable for every s\in\mathbb R^n. Put F(s)=\int f(s,\omega)d\mu(\omega) and define F(x) and f(x,\omega) via Krivine's Function Calculus. We prove that under certain natural assumptions F(x)=\int f(x,\omega)d\mu(\omega), where the right hand side is a Bochner integral.
