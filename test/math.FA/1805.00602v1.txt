For a given set of n\times n matrices \mathcal F, we study the union of the C-numerical ranges of the matrices in the set \mathcal F, denoted by W_C({\mathcal F}). We obtain basic algebraic and topological properties of W_C({\mathcal F}), and show that there are connections between the geometric properties of W_C({\mathcal F}) and the algebraic properties of C and the matrices in {\mathcal F}. Furthermore, we consider the starshapedness and convexity of the set W_C({\mathcal F}). In particular, we show that if {\mathcal F} is the convex hull of two matrices such that W_C(A) and W_C(B) are convex, then the set W_C({\mathcal F}) is star-shaped. We also investigate the extensions of the results to the joint C-numerical range of an m-tuple of matrices.
