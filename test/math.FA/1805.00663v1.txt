The aim of this paper is to characterize continuous endomorphisms in the space of entire functions of exponential type of order p>0. Let A_p denote the space of entire functions of n complex variables z\in{\mathbb C}^n of order p of normal type. We consider an endomorphism F in the space, which is considered to be a DFS-space. We show that there is a unique linear differential operator P of infinite order with coefficients in the space which realizes F, that is, Ff=Pf holds for any f\in A_p. The coefficients satisfy certain growth conditions and conversely, if a formal differential operator of infinite order with coefficients in A_p satisfy these conditions, then it induces a continuous endomorphism.
