Let 1\le p<\infty. A Banach lattice E is said to be disjointly homogeneous (resp. p-disjointly homogeneous) if two arbitrary normalized disjoint sequences from E contain equivalent in E subsequences (resp. every normalized disjoint sequence contains a subsequence equivalent in E to the unit vector basis of l_p). Answering a question raised in 2014 by Flores, Hernandez, Spinu, Tradacete, and Troitsky, for each 1<p<\infty, we construct a reflexive p-disjointly homogeneous rearrangement invariant space on [0,1] whose dual is not disjointly homogeneous. Employing methods from interpolation theory, we provide new examples of disjointly homogeneous rearrangement invariant spaces; in particular, we show that there is a Tsirelson type disjointly homogeneous rearrangement invariant space, which contains no subspace isomorphic to l_p, 1\le p<\infty, or c_0.
