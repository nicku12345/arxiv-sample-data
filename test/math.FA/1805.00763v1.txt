We study the fractional maximal operator acting between Orlicz spaces. We characterise whether the operator is bounded between two given Orlicz spaces. Also a necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal target and domain spaces are established and the explicit formulas of corresponding optimal Young functions are presented.
