In a seminal work, B. Simon provided a classification of nonnegative Schr\"odinger operators -\Delta+V into subcritical and critical operators based on the long-term behaviour of the associated heat kernel. Later works by others developed an alternative subcritical/critical classification based on whether or not the operator admits a weighted spectral gap. All these works dealt only with potentials that ensured the validity of Harnack's inequality, typically potentials in L^p_{loc} for some p > \frac{N}{2}. This paper extends such a weighted spectral gap classification to a large class of locally integrable potentials V called balanced potentials here. Harnack's inequality will not hold in general for such potentials. In addition to the standard potentials in the space L^p_{loc} for some p > \frac{N}{2}, this class contains potentials which are locally bounded above or more generally, those for which the positive and negative singularities are separated as well as those for which the interaction of the positive and negative singularities is not "too strong". We also establish for such potentials, under the additional assumption that V^+ \in L^p_{loc} for some p > \frac{N}{2}, versions of the Agmon-Allegretto-Piepenbrink Principle characterising the subcritical/critical operators in terms of the cone of positive distributional super-solutions (or solutions).   A compressed version of this work has appeared in the paper : M. Lucia and S. Prashanth, Criticality theory for Schrodinger operators with singular potential, J. Differential Equations 265(2018), 3400-3440. We also remove here some restrictions imposed in section 10.3 of this paper.
