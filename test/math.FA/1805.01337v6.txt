We give a simple definition of a spectral shift function for pairs of nonpositive operators on Banach spaces and prove trace formulas of Lifshitz-Kre\u{\i}n type for a perturbation of an operator monotonic (negative complete Bernstein) function of negative and nonpositive operators on Banach spaces induced by nuclear perturbation of an operator argument. The Lipschitzness of such functions is also investigated. The results may be regarded as a contribution to a perturbation theory for Hirsch functional calculus.
