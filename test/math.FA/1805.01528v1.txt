Our aim in this paper is to attain a sharp asymptotic estimate for the greedy constant C_g[\mathcal{H}^{(p)},L_p] of the (normalized) Haar system \mathcal{H}^{(p)} in L_{p}[0,1] for 1<p<\infty. We will show that the superdemocracy constant of \mathcal{H}^{(p)} in L_{p}[0,1] grows as p^{\ast}=\max\{p,p/(p-1)\} as p^* goes to \infty. Thus, since the unconditionality constant of \mathcal{H}^{(p)} in L_{p}[0,1] is p^*-1, the well-known general estimates for the greedy constant of a greedy basis obtained from the intrinsic features of greediness (namely, democracy and unconditionality) yield that p^{\ast}\lesssim C_g[\mathcal{H}^{(p)},L_p]\lesssim (p^{\ast})^{2}. Going further, we develop techniques that allow us to close the gap between those two bounds, establishing that, in fact, C_g[\mathcal{H}^{(p)},L_p]\approx p^{\ast}.
