In this paper we describe the Euler semigroup \{e^{-t\mathbb{E}^{*}\mathbb{E}}\}_{t>0} on homogeneous Lie groups, which allows us to obtain various types of the Hardy-Sobolev and Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequalities for the Euler operator \mathbb{E}. Moreover, the sharp remainder terms of the Sobolev type inequality, maximal Hardy inequality and |\cdot|-radial weighted Hardy-Sobolev type inequality are established.
