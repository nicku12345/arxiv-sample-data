We extend to binary relational systems the notion of compact and normal structure, introduced by J.P.Penot for metric spaces, and we prove that for the involutive and reflexive ones, every commuting family of relational homomorphisms has a common fixed point. The proof is based upon the clever argument that J.B.Baillon discovered in order to show that a similar conclusion holds for bounded hyperconvex metric spaces and then refined by the first author to metric spaces with a compact and normal structure. Since the non-expansive mappings are relational homomorphisms, our result includes those of T.C.Lim, J.B.Baillon and the first author. We show that it extends the Tarski's fixed point theorem to graphs which are retracts of reflexive oriented zigzags of bounded length. Doing so, we illustrate the fact that the consideration of binary relational systems or of generalized metric spaces are equivalent.
