We give necessary and sufficient conditions for an operator A:X\to Y on a Banach space having a shrinking FDD to factor through a Banach space Z such that the Szlenk index of Z is equal to the Szlenk index of A. We also prove that for every ordinal \xi\in (0, \omega_1)\setminus\{\omega^\eta: \eta<\omega_1\text{\ a limit ordinal}\}, there exists a Banach space \mathfrak{G}_\xi having a shrinking basis and Szlenk index \omega^\xi such that for any separable Banach space X and any operator A:X\to Y having Szlenk index less than \omega^\xi, A factors through a subspace and through a quotient of \mathfrak{G}_\xi, and if X has a shrinking FDD, A factors through \mathfrak{G}_\xi.
