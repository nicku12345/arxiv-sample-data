In this work we present a definition for coherence and compatibility of multilinear mappings and homogenous polynomial classes. These definitions are more restricted than the ones proposed before. We began analyzing this new definition in a technical sense, searching for what it has in common with other approaches. Then, we moved on to a more practical analysis. Through numerous examples of different classes of multilinear mappings and homogenous polynomials we checked the limits on these proposed definitions and propose there is a vast field in which they apply.
