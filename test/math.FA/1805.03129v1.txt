The variance conjecture in Asymptotic Convex Geometry stipulates that the Euclidean norm of a random vector uniformly distributed in a (properly normalised) high-dimensional convex body K\subset {\mathbb R}^n satisfies a Poincar\'e-type inequality, implying that its variance is much smaller than its expectation. We settle the conjecture for the cases when K is the unit ball of the operator norm in classical subspaces of square matrices, which include the subspaces of self-adjoint matrices. Through the estimates we establish, we are also able to show that the unit ball of the operator norm in the subspace of real symmetric matrices or in the subspace of Hermitian matrices is not isotropic, yet is in almost isotropic position.
