We show that a bounded quasinilpotent operator T acting on an infinite dimensional Banach space has an invariant subspace if and only if there exists a rank one operator F and a scalar \alpha\in\mathbb{C}, \alpha\neq 0, \alpha\neq 1, such that T+F and T+\alpha F are also quasinilpotent. We also prove that for any fixed rank-one operator F, almost all perturbations T+\alpha F have invariant subspaces of infinite dimension and codimension.
