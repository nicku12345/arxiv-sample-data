The conditions for sequences \{f_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty} and \{g_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty} being Bessel sequences, frames or Riesz bases, can be expressed in terms of the so-called cross-Gram matrix. In this paper we investigate the cross-Gram operator, G, associated to the sequence \{\langle f_{k}, g_{j}\rangle\}_{j, k=1}^{\infty} and sufficient and necessary conditions for boundedness, invertibility, compactness and positivity of this operator are determined depending on the associated sequences. We show that invertibility of G is not possible when the associated sequences are frames but not Riesz Bases or at most one of them is Riesz basis. In the special case we prove that G is a positive operator when \{g_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty} is the canonical dual of \{f_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty}.
