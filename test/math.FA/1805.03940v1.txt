Motivated by some recently established operator Jensen-type inequalities related to a usual convexity, in the present paper we derive several more accurate operator Jensen-type inequalities for certain subclasses of convex functions. More precisely, we obtain interpolating series of Jensen-type inequalities for log-convex and non-negative superquadratic functions. In particular, we obtain the corresponding refinements of the Jensen-Mercer operator inequality for such classes of functions.
