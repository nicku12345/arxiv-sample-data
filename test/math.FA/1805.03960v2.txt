In this paper we first define the \bar{N}(p,q) summable sequence spaces and obtain some basic results related to these spaces. The necessary and sufficient conditions for infinite matrices A to map these spaces on X~~,~~X=c_0, c \text{ or } \ell_{\infty} is obtained and Hausdorff measure of noncompactness is then used to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the compactness of linear operators defined on these spaces.
