In this paper, we introduce a notion of approximate Connes-biprojectivity for dual Banach algebras. We study the relation between approximate Connes-biprojectivity, Johnson pseudo-Connes amenability and \varphi-Connes amenability. We propose a criterion to show that some certain dual triangular Banach algebras are not approximately Connes-biprojective. Next we show that for a locally compact group G, the Banach algebra M(G) is approximately Connes-biprojective if and only if G is amenable. Finally for an infinite commutative compact group G we show that the Banach algebra L^2(G) with convolution product is approximately Connes-biprojective, but it is not Connes-biprojective.
