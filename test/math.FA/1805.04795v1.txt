The purpose of this new survey paper is, among other things, to collect in one place most of the articles on cone (abstract, K-metric) spaces, published after 2007. This list can be useful to young researchers trying to work in this part of functional and nonlinear analysis. On the other hand, the existing review papers on cone metric spaces are updated.   The main contribution is the observation that it is usually redundant to treat the case when the underlying cone is solid and non-normal. Namely, using simple properties of cones and Minkowski functionals, it is shown that the problems can be usually reduced to the case when the cone is normal, even with the respective norm being monotone. Thus, we offer a synthesis of the respective fixed point problems arriving at the conclusion that they can be reduced to their standard metric counterparts. However, this does not mean that the whole theory of cone metric spaces is redundant, since some of the problems remain which cannot be treated in this way, which is also shown in the present article.
