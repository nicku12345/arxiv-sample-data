Recently, P\'{a}lfia introduced a generalized Karcher mean as a solution of an operator equation. In this article, we present several relations for this new mean.   In particular, we investigate the behavior of this generalized mean when filtered through positive linear maps, thus its information monotonicity is revealed, and operator monotone function.
