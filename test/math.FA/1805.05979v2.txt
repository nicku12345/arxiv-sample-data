We show that for every 1<n<\infty, there exits a Banach space X_n containing proximinal subspaces of codimension n but no proximinal finite codimensional subspaces of higher codimension. Moreover, the set of norm-attaining functionals of X_n contains n-dimensional subspaces, but no subspace of higher dimension. This gives a n-by-n version of the solutions given by Read and Rmoutil to problems of Singer and Godefroy. We also study the existence of strongly proximinal subspaces of finite codimension, showing that for every 1<n<\infty and 1\leqslant k <n, there is a Banach space X_{n,k} containing proximinal subspaces of finite codimension up to n but not higher, and containing strongly proximinal subspaces of finite codimension up to k but not higher. Finally, we deal with possible infinite-dimensional versions of the previous results, showing that there are \emph{non-separable} Banach spaces whose set of norm-attaining functionals contains infinite-dimensional separable linear subspaces but no non-separable subspaces.
