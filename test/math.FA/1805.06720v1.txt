In Orlicz spaces generated by convex Orlicz functions a family of norms generated by some lattice norms in \mathbb{R}^{2} are defined and studied. This family of norms includes the family of the p-Amemiya norms (1\leq p\leq\infty) studied in [10-11], [14-15] and [20]. Criteria for strict monotonicity, lower and upper local uniform monotonicities and uniform monotonicities of Orlicz spaces and their subspaces of order continuous elements, equipped with these norms, are given in terms of the generating Orlicz functions, and the lattice norm in \mathbb{R}^{2}. The problems of strict convexity and of the existence of order almost isometric as well as of order isometric copies in these spaces are also discussed.
