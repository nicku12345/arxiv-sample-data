The set D_{A_0}, of pairs of orthogonal projections (P,Q) in generic position with fixed difference P-Q=A_0, is shown to be a homogeneus smooth manifold: it is the quotient of the unitary group of the commutant \{A_0\}' divided by the unitary subgroup of the commutant \{P_0, Q_0\}', where (P_0,Q_0) is any fixed pair in D_{A_0}. Endowed with a natural reductive structure (a linear connection) and the quotient Finsler metric of the operator norm, it behaves as a classic Riemannian space: any two pairs in D_{A_0} are joined by a geodesic of minimal length. Given a base pair (P_0,Q_0), pairs in an open dense subset of D_{A_0} can be joined to (P_0,Q_0) by a {\it unique} minimal geodesic.
