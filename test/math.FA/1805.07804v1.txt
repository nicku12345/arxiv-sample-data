Very recently, Bo\v{z}in and Karapetrovi\'c solved a conjecture by proving that the norm of the Hilbert matrix operator \mathcal{H} on the Bergman space A^p is equal to \frac{\pi}{\sin(\frac{2\pi}{p})} for 2 < p < 4. In this article we present a partly new and simplified proof of this result. Moreover, we calculate the exact value of the norm of \mathcal{H} defined on the Korenblum spaces H^\infty_\alpha for 0 < \alpha \le 2/3 and an upper bound for the norm on the scale 2/3 < \alpha < 1.
