Botelho, Jamison, and Moln\'ar \cite{BJM}, and Geh\' er and \v{S}emrl \cite{GeS} have recently described the general form of surjective isometries of Grassmann spaces of all projections of a fixed finite rank on a Hilbert space H. As a straightforward consequence one can characterize surjective isometries of Grassmann spaces of projections of a fixed finite corank. In this paper we solve the remaining structural problem for surjective isometries on the set P_\infty (H) of all projections of infinite rank and infinite corank when H is separable. The proof technique is entirely different from the previous ones and is based on the study of geodesics in the Grassmannian P_\infty (H). However, the same method gives an alternative proof in the case of finite rank projections.
