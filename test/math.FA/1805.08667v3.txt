In this paper, we define and study Gevrey spaces associated with a H\"ormander family of (globally defined) vector fields and its corresponding sub-Laplacian. We show some natural relations between the various Gevrey spaces in this setting on general manifolds, and more particular properties on Lie groups with polynomial growth of the volume. In the case of the Heisenberg group and of SU(2), we show that all our descriptions coincide.
