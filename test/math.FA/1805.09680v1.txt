Let \Psi and \Sigma be bounded sets of positive kernel operators on a Banach function space L. We prove several refinements of the known inequalities \rho \left(\Psi ^{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)} \circ \Sigma ^{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)} \right) \le \rho (\Psi \Sigma) ^{\frac{1}{2}} \;\; \mathrm{and}\;\; \hat{\rho} \left(\Psi ^{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)} \circ \Sigma ^{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)} \right) \le \hat{\rho} (\Psi \Sigma) ^{\frac{1}{2}}  for the generalized spectral radius \rho and the joint spectral radius \hat{\rho}, where \Psi ^{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)} \circ \Sigma ^{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}  denotes the   Hadamard (Schur) geometric mean of the sets \Psi  and \Sigma. Furthermore, we prove that analogous inequalities hold also for the generalized essential spectral radius and the joint essential spectral radius in the case when L and its Banach dual L^* have order continuous norms.
