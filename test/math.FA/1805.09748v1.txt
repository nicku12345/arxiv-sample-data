We characterize those bounded multilinear operators that factor through a Hilbert space in terms of its behavior in finite sequences. This extends a result, essentially due to S. Kwapie\'{n}, from the linear to the multilinear setting. We prove that Hilbert-Schmidt and Lipschitz 2-summing multilinear operators naturally factor through a Hilbert space. It is also proved that the class \Gamma of all multilinear operators that factor through a Hilbert space is a maximal multi-ideal; moreover, we give an explicit formulation of a finitely generated tensor norm \gamma which is in duality with \Gamma.
