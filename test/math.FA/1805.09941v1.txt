In this paper, we consider the planar self-affine measures \mu_{M,D} generated by an expanding matrix M\in M_2(\mathbb{Z}) and an integer digit set  D=\left\{ {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 0\\ 0 \end{array}} \right),\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} \alpha_1\\ \alpha_2 \end{array}} \right),\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} \beta_1\\ \beta_2 \end{array}} \right)} \right\}  with \alpha_1\beta_2-\alpha_2\beta_1\neq0. We show that if \det(M)\notin 3\mathbb{Z}, then the mutually orthogonal exponential functions in L^2(\mu_{M,D}) is finite, and the exact maximal cardinality is given.
