For a compact set K\subset \mathbb{R}^m, we have two indexes given under simple parameters of the set K (these parameters go back to Besicovitch and Taylor in the late 50's). In the present paper we prove that with the exception of a single extreme value for each index, we have the following elementary estimate on how fast the ratio in the strong density theorem of Saks will tend to one \[ \frac{|R\cap K|}{|R|}>1-o\bigg(\frac{1}{|\log d(R)|}\bigg) \qquad \text{for a.e.} \ \ x\in K \ \ \text{and for} \ \ d(R)\to 0 \] (provided x\in R, where R is an interval in \mathbb{R}^m, d stands for the diameter and |\cdot| is the Lebesgue measure). This work is a natural sequence of [3] and constitutes a contribution to Problem 146 of Ulam [5, p. 245] (see also [8, p.78]) and Erd\"{o}s' Scottish Book `Problems' [5, Chapter 4, pp. 27-33], since it is known that no general statement can be made on how fast the density will tend to one.
