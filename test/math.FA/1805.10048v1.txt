Let X be a Riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type and T be a linear translation-invariant operator which is bounded on L^p(X). We shall show that if T is not a constant multiple of identity then there exist complex constants z such that zT is chaotic on L^p(X) when p is in the sharp range 2<p<\infty. This vastly generalizes the result that dynamics of the (perturbed) heat semigroup is chaotic on X proved in [15, 17].
