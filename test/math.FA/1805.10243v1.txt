In this paper, we study the hypercyclicity of forward and backward shifts on weighted L^p spaces of a directed tree. In the forward case, only the trivial trees may support hypercyclic shifts, in which case the classical results of Salas apply. For the backward case, nontrivial trees may support hypercyclic shifts. We obtain necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for hypercyclicity of the backward shift and, in the case of a rooted tree on an unweighted space, we show that these conditions coincide.
