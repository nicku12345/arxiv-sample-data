In this work we shall prove new results on the theory of convolution operators on spaces of entire functions. The focus is on hypercyclicity results for convolution operators on spaces of entire functions of a given type and order; and existence and approximation results for convolution equations on spaces of entire functions of a given type and order. In both cases we give a general method to prove new results that recover, as particular cases, several results of the literature. Applications of these more general results are given, including new hypercyclicity results for convolution operators on spaces on entire functions on \mathbb{C}^n.
