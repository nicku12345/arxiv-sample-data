Let n_j be a lacunary sequence of integers, such that n_{j+1}/n_j\geq r. We are interested in linear combinations of the sequence of finite Riesz products \prod_{j=1}^N(1+\cos(n_j t)). We prove that, whenever the Riesz products are normalized in L^p norm (p\geq 1) and when r is large enough, the L^p norm of such a linear combination is equivalent to the \ell^p norm of the sequence of coefficients. In other words, one can describe many ways of embedding \ell^p into L^p based on Fourier coefficients. This generalizes to vector valued L^p spaces.
