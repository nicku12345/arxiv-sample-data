A particular case of [07] was generalized from contractions to polynomially bounded operators in [G19]. Namely, it is proved in [G19] that if the unitary asymptote of a polynomially bounded operator T contains the bilateral shift of multiplicity 1, then there exists an invariant subspace \mathcal M of T such that T|_{\mathcal M} is similar to the unilateral shift of multiplicity 1. In the present paper, some corollaries of this result are given. In particular, reflexivity of polynomially bounded operators described above is proved.
