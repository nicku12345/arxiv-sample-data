Starting with the Brezis-Browder principle, we give stronger versions of many variational principles and minimal element theorems which appeared in the recent literature. Relationships among the elements of different sets of assumptions are discussed and clarified, i.e., assumptions to the metric structure of the underlying space and boundedness assumptions. New results involving set-valued maps and the increasingly popular set relations are obtained along the way.
