Grothendieck's theorem asserts that every continuous linear operator from \ell_1 to \ell_2 is absolutely (1,1)-summing. This kind of result is commonly called coincidence result. In this paper we investigate coincidence results in the multilinear setting, showing how the cotype of the spaces involved affect such results. The special role played by \ell_1 spaces is also investigated with relation to interpolation of tensor products. In particular, an open problem on the interpolation of m injective tensor products is solved.
