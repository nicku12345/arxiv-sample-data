In this paper we investigate Poincar\'e-type integral inequalities in the functional Musielak structure. We extend the ones already well known in Sobolev, Orlicz and variable exponent Sobolev spaces. We introduce conditions on the Musielak functions under which they hold. The identification with null trace functions space is given.
