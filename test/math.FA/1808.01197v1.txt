The main aim of this paper is to introduce and analyze the notions of subspace almost periodicity and subspace weak almost periodicity for C-distribution semigroups and C-distribution cosine functions in Banach spaces. We continue our previous research study of almost periodicity of abstract Volterra integro-differential equations \cite{aot}, focusing our attention on the abstract ill-posed Cauchy problems of first order.
