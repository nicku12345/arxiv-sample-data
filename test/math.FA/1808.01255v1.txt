We analyze f-frequently hypercyclic, q-frequently hypercyclic (q> 1) and frequently hypercyclic C_{0}-semigroups (q=1) defined on complex sectors, working in the setting of separable infinite-dimensional Fr\'echet spaces. Some structural results of ours are given for a general class of {\mathcal F}-frequently hypercyclic C_{0}-semigroups, as well. We investigate generalized frequently hypercyclic translation semigroups and generalized frequently hypercyclic semigroups induced by semiflows on weighted function spaces. Several illustrative examples are presented.
