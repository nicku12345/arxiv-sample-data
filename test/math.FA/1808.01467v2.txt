For each p>1 and each positive integer m we give intrinsic characterizations of the restriction of the Sobolev space W^m_p(R) and homogeneous Sobolev space L^m_p(R) to an arbitrary closed subset E of the real line. In particular, we show that the classical one dimensional Whitney extension operator is "universal" for the scale of L^m_p(R) spaces in the following sense: for every p\in(1,\infty] it provides almost optimal L^m_p-extensions of functions defined on E. The operator norm of this extension operator is bounded by a constant depending only on m. This enables us to prove several constructive W^m_p- and L^m_p-extension criteria expressed in terms of m^{th} order divided differences of functions.
