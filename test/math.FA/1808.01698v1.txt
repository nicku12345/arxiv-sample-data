Orlicz--Morrey spaces are generalizations of Orlicz spaces and Morrey spaces which were first introduced by Nakai. There are three versions of Orlicz--Morrey spaces, i.e: Nakai's (2004), Sawano--Sugano--Tanaka's (2012), and Deringoz--Guliyev--Samko's (2014) versions. On this article we will discuss the third version of weak Orlicz--Morrey space which is seen as an enlargement of third version of (strong) Orlicz--Morrey space. Similar to its first version and second version, the third version of weak Orlicz-Morrey space is considered as a generalization of weak Orlicz spaces, weak Morrey spaces, and generalized weak Morrey spaces. In this study, we will investigate some properties of the third version of weak Orlicz--Morrey spaces, especially the sufficient and necessary conditions for inclusion relations between two these spaces. One of the keys to get our result is to estimate the quasi-norm of characteristics function of open balls in \mathbb{R}^n.
