We explore extreme contractions between finite-dimensional polygonal Banach spaces, from the point of view of attainment of norm of a linear operator. We prove that if  X  is an  n- dimensional polygonal Banach space and  Y  is any Banach space and  T \in L(X,Y)  is an extreme contraction, then  T  attains norm at  n  linearly independent extreme points of  B_{X}.  Moreover, if  T  attains norm at  n  linearly independent extreme points  x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n  of  B_X  and does not attain norm at any other extreme point of  B_X,  then each  Tx_i  is an extreme point of  B_Y. We completely characterize extreme contractions between a finite-dimensional polygonal Banach space and a strictly convex Banach space. We introduce L-P property for a pair of Banach spaces and show that it has natural connections with our present study. We also prove that for any strictly convex Banach space  X  and any finite-dimensional polygonal Banach space  Y,  the pair  (X,Y)  does not have L-P property. Finally, we obtain a characterization of Hilbert spaces among strictly convex Banach spaces in terms of L-P property.
