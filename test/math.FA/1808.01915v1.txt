The main purpose of this paper is to investigate degenerate C-(ultra)distribution cosine functions in the setting of barreled sequentially complete locally convex spaces. In our approach, the infinitesimal generator of a degenerate C-(ultra)distribution cosine function is a multivalued linear operator and the regularizing operator C is not necessarily injective. We provide a few important theoretical novelties, considering also exponential subclasses of degenerate C-(ultra)distribution cosine functions.
