This note calls attention to an alternative version of the main result from [4], which can be used together with Maclaurin series expansions and trigonometric identities to show that the terraced matrices generated by the sequences \{\ln (1+1/(n+1)) : n \geq 0\}, \{\tan (1/(n+2)) : n \geq 0\}, and \{\sinh (1/(n+2)) : n \geq 0\} are hyponormal operators on \ell^2. Along the way it is also shown that the matrix generated by \{\tan (1/(n+1)) : n \geq 0\} is not a hyponormal operator on \ell^2.
