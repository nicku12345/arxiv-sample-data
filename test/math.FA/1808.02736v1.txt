In this manuscript, we claim that the newly introduced \mathcal{F}-metric space \cite[\, M.~Jleli and B.~Samet, On a new generalization of metric spaces, J. Fixed Point Theory Appl, 20(3) 2018]{JS1} is metrizable. Also, we deduce that the notions of convergence, Cauchy sequence, completeness due to Jleli and Samet for \mathcal{F}-metric spaces are equivalent with that of usual metric spaces. Moreover, we assert that the Banach contraction principle in the context of \mathcal{F}-metric spaces is a direct consequence of its standard metric counterpart.
