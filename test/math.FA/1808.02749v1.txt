In this paper, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of generalized weighted pseudo-almost automorphic solutions of abstract Volterra integro-differential inclusions in Banach spaces. The main results are devoted to the study of various types of weighted pseudo-almost periodic (automorphic) properties of convolution products. We illustrate our abstract results with some examples and possible applications.
