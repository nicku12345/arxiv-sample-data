In this paper, we examine various types of {\mathcal F}-hypercyclic ({\mathcal F}-topologically transitive) and disjoint {\mathcal F}-hypercyclic (disjoint {\mathcal F}-topologically transitive) properties of binary relations over topological spaces. We pay special attention to finite structures like simple graphs, digraphs and tournaments, providing a great number of illustrative examples.
