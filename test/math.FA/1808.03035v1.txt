We generalize the notion of M-ideals in order smooth \infty-normed spaces to "smooth p-order ideals" in order smooth p-normed spaces. We show that if V is an order smooth p-normed space and W is a closed subspace of V, then W is a smooth p-order ideal in V if and only if W^{\perp} is a smooth p'-order ideal in order smooth p'-normed space if and only if W^{\perp\perp} is a smooth p-order ideal in order smooth p-normed space V^{**}. We prove that every L-summand in order smooth 1-normed space is a smooth 1-order ideal. We find a condition under which every M-ideal in order smooth \infty-normed space is a smooth \infty-order ideal. We show that every M-ideal in order smooth \infty-normed space is smooth \infty-order ideal.
