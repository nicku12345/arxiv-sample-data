We study complex interpolation scales obtained by vector valued amalgamation and the derivations they generate. We study their trivial and singular character and obtain examples showing that the hypotheses in the main theorems of [J.M.F. Castillo, V. Ferenczi and M. Gonz\'alez, \emph{Singular exact sequences generated by complex interpolation}, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 369 (2017) 4671--4708] are not necessary.
