The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of an asymptotically almost periodic ultradistribution and asymptotically almost automorphic ultradistribution with values in a Banach space, as well as to further analyze the classes of asymptotically almost periodic and asymptotically almost automorphic distributions with values in a Banach space. We provide some applications of the introduced concepts in the analysis of systems of ordinary differential equations.
