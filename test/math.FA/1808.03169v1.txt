This paper studies the bounded approximation property (BAP) in quasi Banach spaces. In the first part of the paper we show that the kernel of any surjective operator \ell_p\to X has the BAP when X has it and 0<p\leq 1, which is an analogue of the corresponding result of Lusky for Banach spaces. We then obtain and study nonlocally convex versions of the Kadec-Pe\l czy\'nski-Wojtaszczyk complementably universal spaces for Banach spaces with the BAP.
