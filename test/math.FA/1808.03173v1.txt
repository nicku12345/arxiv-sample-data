Let X be a Banach space and let \kappa(X) denote the kernel of a quotient map \ell_1(\Gamma)\to X. We show that \Ext^2(X,X^*)=0 if and only if bilinear forms on \kappa(X) extend to \ell_1(\Gamma). From that we obtain i) If \kappa(X) is a \mathcal L_1-space then \Ext^2(X,X^*)=0; ii) If X is separable, \kappa(X) is not an \mathcal L_1 space and \Ext^2(X,X^*)=0 then \kappa(X) has an unconditional basis. This provides new insight into a question of Palamodov in the category of Banach spaces.
