A new analytic model for left-invertible operators is introduced and investigated. We show that left-invertible operator T, which satisfies certain conditions can be modelled as a multiplication operator \mathscr{M}_z on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of vector-valued analytic functions on an annulus or a disc. A similar result for composition operators in \ell^2-spaces is established.
