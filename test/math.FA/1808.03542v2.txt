Given a Banach space operator A, the isolated eigenvalues E(A) and the poles \Pi(A) (resp., eigenvalues E^a(A) which are isolated points of the approximate point spectrum and the left ploles \Pi^a(A)) of the spectrum of A satisfy \Pi(A)\subseteq E(A) (resp., \Pi^a(A)\subseteq E^a(A)), and the reverse inclusion holds if and only if E(A) (resp., E^a(A)) has empty intersection with the B-Weyl spectrum (resp., upper B-Weyl spectrum) of A. Evidently \Pi(A)\subseteq E^a(A), but no such inclusion exists for E(A) and \Pi^a(A). The study of identities E(A)=\Pi^a(A) and E^a(A)=\Pi(A), and their stability under perturbation by commuting Riesz operators, has been of some interest in the recent past. This paper studies the stability of these identities under perturbation by (non-commuting) compact operators. Examples of analytic Toeplitz operators and operators satisfying the abstract shift condition are considered.
