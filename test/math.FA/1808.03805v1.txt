We study the existence of multiplier (completely) bounded approximate identities for the Fourier algebras of some classes of hypergroups. In particular we show that, a large class of commutative hypergroups are weakly amenable with the Cowling-Haagerup constant 1. As a corollary, we answer an open question of Eymard on Jacobi hypergroups. We also characterize the existence of bounded approximate identities for the hypergroup Fourier algebras of ultraspherical hypergroups.
