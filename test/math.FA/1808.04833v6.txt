In this study, we refine the compactification presented by Witz \cite{Witz} for general semigroups to the case of bounded C_0-semigroups, involving adjoint theory for this class of operators. This approach considerably reduces the operator space in which the compactification is performed. Additionally, this approach leads to a decomposition of X^{\sun} and to an extension of ergodic results to dual semigroups.
