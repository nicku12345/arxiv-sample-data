We introduce a notion of (p,q)-dominated multilinear operators which stems from the geometrical approach provided by \Sigma-operators. We prove that (p,q)-dominated multilinear operators can be characterized in terms of their behavior on finite sequences and in terms of their relation with a Laprest\'e tensor norm. We also prove that they verify a generalization of the Pietsch's Domination Theorem and Kwapie\'n's Factorization Theorem. Also, we study the collection \mathcal{D}_{p,q} of all (p,q)-dominated multilinear operators showing that \mathcal{D}_{p,q} has a maximal ideal demeanor and that the Laprest\'e norm has a finitely generated behavior.
