We give a unified approach to handle the problem of extending functions with values in a locally convex Hausdorff space E over a field \mathbb{K}, which have weak extensions in a space \mathcal{F}(\Omega,\mathbb{K}) of scalar-valued functions on a set \Omega, to functions in a vector-valued counterpart \mathcal{F}(\Omega,E) of \mathcal{F}(\Omega,\mathbb{K}). The results obtained base upon a representation of vector-valued functions as linear continuous operators and extend results of Bonet, Frerick, Gramsch and Jord\'{a}. In particular, we apply them to obtain a sequence space representation of \mathcal{F}(\Omega,E) from a known representation of \mathcal{F}(\Omega,\mathbb{K}).
