We introduce variable exponent versions of Morreyfied Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. To that end, we prove an important convolution inequality which is a replacement for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality in the fully variable setting. Using it we obtain characterizations by means of Peetre maximal functions and use them to show the independence of the introduced spaces from the admissible system used.
