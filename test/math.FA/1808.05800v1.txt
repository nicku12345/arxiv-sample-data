Let G be a locally compact group, and let \Phi be a Young function. In this paper, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for weighted translations on the Orlicz space L^\Phi(G) to be disjoint topologically transitive. This characterization for disjoint chaos follows from the investigation on disjoint transitivity immediately.
