Following a result of Hatori, Miura and Tagaki ([4]) we give here a spectral characterization of an isomorphism from a C^\star-algebra onto a Banach algebra. We then use this result to show that a C^\star-algebra A is isomorphic to a Banach algebra B if and only if there exists a surjective function \phi:A\rightarrow B satisfying (i) \sigma\left(\phi(x)\phi(y)\phi(z)\right)=\sigma\left(xyz\right) for all x,y,z\in A (where \sigma denotes the spectrum), and (ii) \phi is continuous at \mathbf 1. A simple example shows that (i) cannot be relaxed to products of two elements, as is the case with commutative Banach algebras. Our results also elaborate on a paper ([3]) of Bre\v{s}ar and \v{S}penko.
