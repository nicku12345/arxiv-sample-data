We study Birkhoff-James orthogonality and isosceles orthogonality of bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces. We explore Birkhoff-James orthogonality of bounded linear operators in light of a new notion introduced by us and also discuss some of the possible applications in this regard. We also study isosceles orthogonality of bounded (positive) linear operators on a Hilbert space and some of the related properties, including that of operators having disjoint support. We further explore the relations between Birkhoff-James orthogonality and isosceles orthogonality in a general Banach space.
