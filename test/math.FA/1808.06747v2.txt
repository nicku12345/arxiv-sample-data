Let X be a Banach lattice. A well-known problem arising from the theory of risk measures asks when order closedness of a convex set in X implies closedness with respect to the topology \sigma(X,X_n^\sim), where X_n^\sim is the order continuous dual of X. Motivated by the solution in the Orlicz space case, we introduce two relevant properties: the disjoint order continuity property (DOCP) and the order subsequence splitting property (OSSP). We show that when X is monotonically complete with OSSP and X_n^\sim contains a strictly positive element, every order closed convex set in X is \sigma(X,X_n^\sim)-closed if and only if X has DOCP and either X or X_n^\sim is order continuous. This in turn occurs if and only if either X or the norm dual X^* of X is order continuous. We also give a modular condition under which a Banach lattice has OSSP. In addition, we also give a characterization of X for which order closedness of a convex set in X is equivalent to closedness with respect to the topology \sigma(X,X_{uo}^\sim), where X_{uo}^\sim is the unbounded order continuous dual of X.
