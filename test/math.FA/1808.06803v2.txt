In this paper we develop generalized d'Alembert's formulas for abstract fractional integro-differential equations and fractional differential equations on Banach spaces. Some examples are given to illustrate our abstract results, and the probability interpretation of these fractional d'Alembert's formulas are also given. Moreover, we also provide d'Alembert's formulas for abstract fractional telegraph equations.
