We generalize the C-numerical range W_C(T) from trace-class to Schatten-class operators, i.e. to C\in\mathcal B^p(\mathcal H) and T\in\mathcal B^q(\mathcal H) with 1/p + 1/q = 1, and show that its closure is always star-shaped with respect to the origin. For q \in (1,\infty], this is equivalent to saying that the closure of the image of the unitary orbit of T\in\mathcal B^q(\mathcal H) under any continous linear functional L\in(\mathcal B^q(\mathcal H))' is star-shaped with respect to the origin. For q=1, one has star-shapedness with respect to \operatorname{tr}(T)W_e(L), where W_e(L) denotes the essential range of L. Moreover, the closure of W_C(T) is convex if C or T is normal with collinear eigenvalues. If C and T are both normal, then the C-spectrum of T is a subset of the C-numerical range, which itself is a subset of the closure of the convex hull of the C-spectrum. This closure coincides with the closure of the C-numerical range if, in addition, the eigenvalues of C or T are collinear.
