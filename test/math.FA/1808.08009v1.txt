In this note, we study the asymptotics of the determinant \det(I_N - \beta H_N) for N large, where H_N is the N\times N restriction of a Hankel matrix H with finitely many jump discontinuities in its symbol satisfying \|H\|\leq 1. Moreover, we assume \beta\in\mathbb C with |\beta|<1 and I_N denotes the identity matrix. We determine the first order asymtoptics as N\to\infty of such determinants and show that they exhibit power-like asymptotic behaviour, with exponent depending on the height of the jumps. For example, for the N \times N truncation of the Hilbert matrix \mathbf{H} with matrix elements \pi^{-1}(j+k+1)^{-1}, where j,k\in \mathbb Z_+ we obtain  \log \det(I_N - \beta \mathbf{H}_N) = -\frac{\log N}{2\pi^2}   \big(\pi\arcsin(\beta)+\arcsin^2(\beta)+o(1)\big),\qquad N\to\infty.
