In this paper, we introduce the concept of semi-continuous g-frames in Hilbert spaces. We first construct an example of semi-continuous g-frames using the Fourier transform of the Heisenberg group and study the structure of such frames. Then, as an application we provide some fundamental identities and inequalities for semi-continuous g-frames. Finally, we present a classical perturbation result and prove that semi-continuous g-frames are stable under small perturbations.
