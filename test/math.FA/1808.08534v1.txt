We extend the result of B. Cascales at al. about expand-contract plasticity of the unit ball of strictly convex Banach space to those spaces whose unit ball is the union of all its finite-dimensional polyhedral extreme subsets. We also extend the definition of expand-contract plasticity to uniform spaces and generalize the theorem on expand-contract plasticity of totally bounded metric spaces to this new setting.
