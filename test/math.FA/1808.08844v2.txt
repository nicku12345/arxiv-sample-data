For each  \alpha > 0 , the \alpha-Bloch space is consisting of all analytic functions f on the unit disk satisfying  \sup_{|z|<1} (1-|z|^2)^\alpha |f'(z)| < + \infty. In this paper, we consider the following complex integral operator, namely the \beta-Ces\`{a}ro operator \begin{equation}   C_\beta(f)(z)=\int_{0}^{z}\frac{f(w)}{w(1-w)^{\beta}}dw \nonumber \end{equation} and its generalization, acting from the \alpha-Bloch space to itself, where f(0)=0 and \beta\in\mathbb{R}. We investigate the boundedness and compactness of the \beta-Ces\`{a}ro operators and their generalization. Also we calculate the essential norm and spectrum of these operators.
