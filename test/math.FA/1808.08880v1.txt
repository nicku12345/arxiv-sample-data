A closed subspace \mathcal{M} of the Hardy space H^2(\mathbb{D}^2) over the bidisk is called a submodule if it is invariant under multiplication by coordinate functions z_1 and z_2. Whether every finitely generated submodule is Hilbert-Schmidt is an unsolved problem. This paper proves that every finitely generated submodule \mathcal{M} containing z_1 - \varphi(z_2) is Hilbert-Schmidt, where \varphi is any finite Blaschke product. Some other related topics such as fringe operator and Fredholm index are also discussed.
