We consider a multiplicative variation on the classical Kowalski-S\l{}odkowski Theorem which identifies the characters among the collection of all functionals on a Banach algebra A. In particular we show that, if A is a C^*-algebra, and if \phi:A\mapsto\mathbb C is a continuous function satisfying \phi(\mathbf 1)=1 and \phi(x)\phi(y) \in \sigma(xy) for all x,y\in A (where \sigma denotes the spectrum), then \phi generates a corresponding character \psi_\phi on A which coincides with \phi on the principal component of the invertible group of A. We also show that, if A is any Banach algebra whose elements have totally disconnected spectra, then, under the aforementioned conditions, \phi is always a character.
