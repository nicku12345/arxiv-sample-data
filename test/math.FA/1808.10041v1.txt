In this paper we propose a different (and equivalent) norm on S^{2} ({\mathbb{D}}) which consists of functions whose derivatives are in the Hardy space of unit disk. The reproducing kernel of S^{2}({\mathbb{D}}) in this norm admits an explicit form, and it is a complete Nevanlinna-Pick kernel. Furthermore, there is a surprising connection of this norm with 3 -isometries. We then study composition and multiplication operators on this space. Specifically, we obtain an upper bound for the norm of C_{\varphi} for a class of composition operators. We completely characterize multiplication operators which are m-isometries. As an application of the 3-isometry, we describe the reducing subspaces of M_{\varphi} on S^{2}({\mathbb{D}}) when \varphi is a finite Blaschke product of order 2.
