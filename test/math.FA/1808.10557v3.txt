Let \mathcal{E} and \mathcal{F} be symmetrically \Delta-normed (in particular, quasi-normed) operator spaces affiliated with semifinite von Neumann algebras \mathcal{M}_1 and \mathcal{M}_2, respectively. We establish a noncommutative version of Abramovich's theorem \cite{A1983}, which provides the general form of normal order-preserving linear operators T:\mathcal{E} \stackrel{into}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{F} having the disjointness preserving property. As an application, we obtain a noncommutative Huijsmans-Wickstead theorem \cite{Huijsmans_W}. By establishing the disjointness preserving property for an order-preserving isometry T:\mathcal{E} \stackrel{into}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{F}, we obtain the existence of a Jordan *-monomorphism from \mathcal{M}_1 into \mathcal{M}_2 and the general form of this isometry, which extends and complements a number of existing results. In particular, we fully resolve the case when \mathcal{F} is the predual of \mathcal{M}_2 and other untreated cases in [Sukochev-Veksler, IEOT, 2018].
