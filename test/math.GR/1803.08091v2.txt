The direct product \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N} of two free monogenic semigroups contains uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic subdirect products. Furthermore, the following hold for \mathbb{N}\times S, where S is a finite semigroup. It contains only countably many pairwise non-isomorphic subsemigroups if and only if S is a union of groups. And it contains only countably many pairwise non-isomorphic subdirect products if and only if every element of S has a relative left- or right identity element.
