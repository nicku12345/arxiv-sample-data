We observe that automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups contain nilpotent non-abelian subgroups, namely H_3(\mathbb{Z}) the three-dimensional integer Heisenberg group, provided they admit a certain type of element, called an adjacent transvection. This represents a (minor) extension of a result of Charney-Vogtmann.
