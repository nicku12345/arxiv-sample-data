We show that certain representations over fields with positive characteristic of groups having CAT(0) fixed point property {\rm F}\mathcal{B}_{\widetilde{A}_n} have finite image. In particular, we obtain rigidity results for representations of the following groups: the special linear group over \mathbb{Z}, SL_k(\mathbb{Z}), the special automorphism group of a free group, {\rm SAut}(F_k), the mapping class group of a closed orientable surface, {\rm Mod}(\Sigma_g), and many other groups.   In the case of characteristic zero we show that low dimensional complex representations of groups having CAT(0) fixed point property {\rm F}\mathcal{B}_{\widetilde{A}_n} have finite image if they always have compact closure.
