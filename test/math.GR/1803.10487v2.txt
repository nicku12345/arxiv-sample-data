A quandle of cyclic type of order n with f\geq 2 fixed points is such that each of its permutations splits into f cycles of length 1 and one cycle of length n-f. In this article we prove that there is only one such connected quandle, up to isomorphism. This is a quandle of order 6 and 2 fixed points, known in the literature as octahedron quandle. We prove also that, for each f\geq 2, the non-connected versions of these quandles only occur for orders n in the range f+2 \leq n \leq 2f and that, for each f>1, there is only one such quandle of order 2f with f fixed points, up to isomorphism. Still in the range f+2 \leq n \leq 2f, we present sufficient conditions for the existence of such quandles, writing down their permutations; we also show how to obtain new quandles form old ones, leaning on the notion of common fixed point.
