Using a construction that builds a monoid from a monoid action, this paper exhibits an example of a direct product of monoids that admits a prefix-closed regular cross-section, but one of whose factors does not admit a regular cross-section; this answers negatively an open question from the theory of Markov monoids. The same construction is then used to show that for any full trios \mathfrak{C} and \mathfrak{D} such that \mathfrak{C} is not a subclass of \mathfrak{D}, there is a monoid with a cross-section in \mathfrak{C} but no cross-section in \mathfrak{D}.
