We give sufficient conditions for the non-triviality of the Poisson boundary of random walks on H(\mathbb{Z}) and its subgroups. The group H(\mathbb{Z}) is the group of piecewise projective homeomorphisms over the integers defined by Monod. For a finitely generated subgroup H of H(\mathbb{Z}), we prove that either H is solvable, or every measure on H with finite first moment that generates it as a semigroup has non-trivial Poisson boundary. In particular, we prove the non-triviality of the Poisson boundary of measures on Thompson's group F that generate it as a semigroup and have finite first moment, which answers a question by Kaimanovich.
