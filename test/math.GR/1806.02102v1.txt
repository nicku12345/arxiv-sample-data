In this paper we have investigated some properties of the power graph and commuting graph associated with a finite group, using their tree-numbers. Among other things, it has been shown that the simple group L_2(7) can be characterized through the tree-number of its power graph. Moreover, the classification of groups with power-free decomposition is presented. Finally, we have obtained an explicit formula concerning the tree-number of commuting graphs associated with the Suzuki simple groups.
