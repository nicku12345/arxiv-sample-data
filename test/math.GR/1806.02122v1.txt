The power graph \mathcal{P}(G) of a finite group G is the graph whose vertex set is G, and two elements in G are adjacent if one of them is a power of the other. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we find the complexity of a clique--replaced graph and study some applications. Second, we derive some explicit formulas concerning the complexity \kappa(\mathcal{P}(G)) for various groups G such as the cyclic group of order n, the simple groups L_2(q), the extra--special p--groups of order p^3, the Frobenius groups, etc.
