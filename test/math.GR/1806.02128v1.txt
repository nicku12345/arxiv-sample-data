Let G be a nonabelian group and n a natural number. We say that G has a strict n-split decomposition if it can be partitioned as the disjoint union of an abelian subgroup A and n nonempty subsets B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n, such that |B_i| > 1 for each i and within each set B_i, no two distinct elements commute. We show that every finite nonabelian group has a strict n-split decomposition for some n. We classify all finite groups G, up to isomorphism, which have a strict n-split decomposition for n = 1, 2, 3. Finally, we show that for a nonabelian group G having a strict n-split decomposition, the index |G:A| is bounded by some function of n.
