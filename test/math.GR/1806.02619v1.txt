Let G be a finite group of Lie type E_6 over F_q (adjoint or simply connected) and W be the Weyl group of G. We describe maximal tori T such that T has a complement in its algebraic normalizer N(G,T). It is well known that for each maximal torus T of G there exists an element w\in W such that N(G,T)/T\simeq C_W(w). When T does not have a complement isomorphic to C_W(w), we show that w has a lift in N(G,T) of the same order.
