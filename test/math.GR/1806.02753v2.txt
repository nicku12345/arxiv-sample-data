Liouville property of actions of discrete groups can be reformulated in terms of existence co-F\olner sets. Since every action of amenable group is Liouville, the property can be served as an approach for proving non-amenability. The verification of this property is conceptually different than finding a non-amenable action. There are many groups that are defined by strongly transitive actions. In some cases amenability of such groups is an open problem. We define n-Liouville property of action to be Liouville property of point-wise action of the group on the sets of cardinality n. We reformulate n-Liouville property in terms of additive combinatorics and prove it for n=1, 2. The case n\geq 3 remains open.
