A finite group P is said to be \emph{primary} if |P|=p^{a} for some prime p. We say a primary subgroup P of a finite group G satisfies the \emph{Frobenius normalizer condition} in G if N_{G}(P)/C_{G}(P) is a p-group provided P is p-group. In this paper, we determine the structure of a finite group G in which every non-subnormal primary subgroup satisfies the Frobenius normalized condition. In particular, we prove that if every non-normal primary subgroup of G satisfies the Frobenius condition, then G/F(G) is cyclic and every maximal non-normal nilpotent subgroup U of G with F(G)U=G is a Carter subgroup of G.
