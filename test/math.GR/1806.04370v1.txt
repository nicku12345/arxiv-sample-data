A dessin is an embedding of connected bipartite graph into an oriented closed surface. A dessin is regular if its group of colour- and orientation-preserving automorphisms acts transitively on the edges. In the present paper regular dessins with a nilpotent automorphism group are investigated, and attention are paid on those with the highest level of external symmetry. Depending on the algebraic theory of dessins and using group-theoretical methods, we present a classification of nilpotent groups of class two which underly a unique regular dessin.
