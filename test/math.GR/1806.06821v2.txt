We continue research into the cyclically presented groups with length three positive relators. We study small cancellation conditions and SQ-universality, we obtain the Betti numbers of the groups' abelianisations, we calculate the orders of the abelianisations of some groups, and we study isomorphism classes of the groups. Through computational experiments we assess how effective the abelianisation is as an invariant for distinguishing non-isomorphic groups.
