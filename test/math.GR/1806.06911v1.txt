The Hopf-Galois structures on normal extensions K/k with G=Gal(K/k) are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of regular subgroups N\leq B=Perm(G) that are normalized by the left regular representation \lambda(G)\leq B. Each such N corresponds to a Hopf algebra H_N=(K[N])^G that acts on K/k. Such regular subgroups N need not be isomorphic to G but must have the same order. One can subdivide the totality of all such N into collections R(G,[M]) which is the set of those regular N normalized by \lambda(G) and isomorphic to a given abstract group M where |M|=|G|. There arises an injective correspondence between the characteristic subgroups of a given N an d the set of subgroups of G stemming from the Galois correspondence between sub-Hopf algebras of H_N and intermediate fields k\subseteq F\subseteq K. We utilize this correspondence to show that for certain pairings (G,[M]), the collection R(G,[M]) must be empty.
