A skew-morphism \varphi of a finite group A is a permutation on A such that \varphi(1)=1 and \varphi(xy)=\varphi(x)\varphi^{\pi(x)}(y) for all x,y\in A where \pi:A\to\mathbb{Z}_{|\varphi|} is an integer function. A skew-morphism is smooth if \pi(\varphi(x))=\pi(x) for all x\in A. The concept of smooth skew-morphisms is a generalization of that of t-balanced skew-morphisms. The aim of the paper is to develop a general theory of smooth skew-morphisms. As an application we classify smooth skew-morphisms of the dihedral groups.
