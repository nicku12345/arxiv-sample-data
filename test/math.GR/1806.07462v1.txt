This paper presents a classification of all p-groups of order p^5 up to isomorphism. It contains a full list of their polycyclic presentations, a short introduction to the basic ideas of the methodes used to classify the groups, and a detailed proof of the adequacy and completeness of the classification and presentations presented in the paper.
