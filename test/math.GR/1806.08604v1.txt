A diagonal base of a Sylow 2-subgroup P_n(2) of symmetric group S_{2^n} is a minimal generating set of this subgroup consisting of elements with only one non-zero coordinate in the polynomial representation. For different diagonal bases Cayley graphs of P_n(2) may have different girths (i.e. minimal lengths of cycles) and thus be non-isomorphic. In presented paper all possible values of girths of Cayley graphs of P_n(2) on diagonal bases are calculated. A criterion for whenever such Cayley graph has girth equal to 4 is presented. A lower bound for the number of different non-isomorphic Cayley graphs of P_n(2) on diagonal bases is proposed.
