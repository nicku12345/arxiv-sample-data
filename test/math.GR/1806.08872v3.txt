We consider the isomorphism problem for finite abelian groups and finite meta-cyclic groups. We prove that for a dense set of positive integers n, isomorphism testing for abelian groups of black-box type of order n can be done in time polynomial in \log n. We also prove that for a dense set of orders n with given prime factors, one can test isomorphism for coprime meta-cyclic groups of black-box type of order n in time polynomial in \log n. Prior methods for these two classes of groups have running times exponential in \log n.
