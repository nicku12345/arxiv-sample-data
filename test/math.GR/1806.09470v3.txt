We study how the cohomology of a type F_\infty relatively hyperbolic group pair (G,\mathcal{P}) changes under Dehn fillings (i.e. quotients of group pairs). For sufficiently long Dehn fillings where the quotient pair (\bar{G},\bar{\mathcal{P}}) is of type F_\infty, we show that there is a spectral sequence relating the cohomology groups H^i(G,\mathcal{P};\mathbb{Z} G) and H^i\left(\bar{G},\bar{\mathcal{P}};\mathbb{Z}\bar{G}\right). As a consequence, we show that essential cohomological dimension does not increase under these Dehn fillings.
