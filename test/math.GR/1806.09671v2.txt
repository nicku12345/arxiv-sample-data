For any graph inverse semigroup G(E) we describe subsemigroups D^0=D\cup\{0\} and J^0=J\cup\{0\} of G(E) where D and J are arbitrary \mathcal{D}-class and \mathcal{J}-class of G(E), respectively. In particular, we prove that for each \mathcal{D}-class D of a graph inverse semigroup over an acyclic graph the semigroup D^0 is isomorphic to a semigroup of matrix units. Also we show that for any elements a,b of a graph inverse semigroup G(E), J_a\cdot J_b\cup J_b\cdot J_a\subset J_b^0 if there exists a path w such that s(w)\in J_a and r(w)\in J_b.
