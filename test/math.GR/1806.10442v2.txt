We consider groups defined by non-empty balanced presentations with the property that each relator is of the form R(x,y), where x and y are distinct generators and R(.,.) is determined by some fixed cyclically reduced word R(a,b) that involves both a and b. To every such presentation we associate a directed graph whose vertices correspond to the generators and whose arcs correspond to the relators. Under the hypothesis that the girth of the underlying undirected graph is at least 4, we show that the resulting groups are non-trivial and cannot be finite of rank 3 or higher. Without the hypothesis on the girth it is well known that both the trivial group and finite groups of rank 3 can arise.
