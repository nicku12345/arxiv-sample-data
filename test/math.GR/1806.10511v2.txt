We enumerate the number of isoclinism classes of semi-extraspecial p-groups with derived subgroup of order p^2. To do this, we enumerate \text{GL}(2, p)-orbits of sets of irreducible, monic polynomials in \mathbb{F}_p[x]. Along the way, we also provide a new construction of an infinite family of semi-extraspecial groups as central quotients of Heisenberg groups over local algebras.
