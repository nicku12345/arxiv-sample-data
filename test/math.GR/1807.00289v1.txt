The power graph of an arbitrary group G is a simple graph with all elements of G as its vertices and two vertices are adjacent if one is a positive power of another. In this paper, we generalize this concept to a graph whose vertices are all elements of G that generate a proper subgroup of G and two elements are adjacent if the cyclic subgroup generated by which have non-trivial intersections. We concentrate on completeness and planarity of this graph.
