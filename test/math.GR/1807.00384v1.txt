A subgroup H of a group G is said to be {pronormal} in G if H and H^g are conjugate in \langle H, H^g \rangle for every g \in G. Some problems in finite group theory, combinatorics, and permutation group theory were solved in terms of pronormality. In 2012, E. Vdovin and the third author conjectured that the subgroups of odd index are pronormal in finite simple groups. In this paper we disprove their conjecture and discuss a recent progress in the classification of finite simple groups in which the subgroups of odd index are pronormal.
