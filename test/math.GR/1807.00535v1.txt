For a classical group G of type \mathsf D_n over a field k of characteristic different from 2, we show the existence of a finitely generated regular extension R of k such that G admits outer automorphisms over R. Using this result and a construction of groups of type \mathsf A from groups of type \mathsf D, we construct new examples of groups of type ^2\mathsf A_n with n\equiv 3\bmod 4 and the first examples of type ^2\mathsf A_n with n\equiv 1\bmod 4 (n\geq 5) that are not R-trivial, hence not rational (nor stably rational).
