Given a finite group G and a subset X of G, the commuting graph of G on X, denoted by {\cal C}(G,X), is the graph that has X as its vertex set with x,y\in X joined by an edge whenever x\neq y and xy=yx. Let T be a transversal of the center Z(G) of G. When G is a finite non-abelian group and X=T\setminus Z(G), we denote the graph {\cal C}(G,X) by {\cal T}(G). In this paper, we show that {\cal T}(G) is a connected strongly regular graph if and only if G is isoclinic to an extraspecial 2-group of order at least 32. We also characterize the finite non-abelian groups G for which the graph {\cal T}(G) is disconnected strongly regular.
