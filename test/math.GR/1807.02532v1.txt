We examine the construction of Huang and Osajda that was used in their proof of the biautomaticity of Artin groups of almost large type. We describe a slightly simpler variant of that biautomatic structure, with explicit descriptions of a few small examples, and we examine some of the properties of the structure. We explain how the construction can be programmed within the GAP system.
