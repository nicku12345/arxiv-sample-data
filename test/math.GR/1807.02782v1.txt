This is the second of two papers in which we investigate the properties of displacement functions of automorphisms of free groups (more generally, free products) on the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space CV_n and its simplicial bordification. We develop a theory for both reducible and irreducible autormorphisms. As we reach the bordification of CV_n we have to deal with general deformation spaces, for this reason we developed the theory in such generality. In first paper~\cite{FMpartI} we studied general properties of the displacement functions, such as well-orderability of the spectrum and the topological characterization of min-points via partial train tracks (possibly at infinity). This paper is devoted to proving that for any automorphism (reducible or not) any level set of the displacement function is connected. As an application, this result provides a stopping procedure for brute force search algorithms in CV_n. We use this to reprove two known algorithmic results: the conjugacy problem for irreducible automorphisms and detecting irreducibility of automorphisms. Note: the two papers were originally packed together in the preprint arxiv:1703.09945. We decided to split that paper following the recommendations of a referee.
