Let m_n(G) denote the number of maximal subgroups of G of index n. An upper bound is given for the degree of maximal subgroup growth of all polycyclic metabelian groups G (i.e., for \limsup \frac{\log m_n(G)}{\log n}, the degree of polynomial growth of m_n(G)). A condition is given for when this upper bound is attained.   For G = \mathbb{Z}^k \rtimes \mathbb{Z}, where A \in GL(k,\mathbb{Z}), it is shown that m_n(G) grows like a polynomial of degree equal to the number of blocks in the rational canonical form of A. The leading term of this polynomial is the number of distinct roots (in \mathbb{C}) of the characteristic polynomial of the smallest block.
