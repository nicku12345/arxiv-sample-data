Recently, Baumslag and Wiegold proved that a finite group G is nilpotent if and only if o(xy)=o(x)o(y) for every x,y\in G of coprime order. Motivated by this result, we study the groups with the property that (xy)^G=x^Gy^G and those with the property that \chi(xy)=\chi(x)\chi(y) for every complex irreducible character \chi of G and every nontrivial x, y \in G of pairwise coprime order. We also consider several ways of weakening the hypothesis on x and y. While the result of Baumslag and Wiegold is completely elementary, some of our arguments here depend on (parts of) the classification of finite simple groups.
