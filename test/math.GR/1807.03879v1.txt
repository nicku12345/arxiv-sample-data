Two short seminal papers of Margulis used Kazhdan's property (T) to give, on the one hand, explicit constructions of expander graphs, and to prove, on the other hand, the uniqueness of some invariant means on compact simple Lie groups. These papers opened a rich line of research on expansion and spectral gap phenomena in finite and compact simple groups. In this paper we survey the history of this area and point out a number of problems which are still open.
