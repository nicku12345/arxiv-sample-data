Recently Rai obtained an upper bound for the order of the Schur multiplier of a d-generator special p-group when its derived subgroup has the maximum value  p^{\frac{1}{2}d(d-1)} for  d\geq 3  and  p\neq 2.  Here we try to obtain the Schur multiplier, the exterior square and the tensor square of such p-groups. Then we specify which ones are capable. Moreover, we give an upper bound for the order of the Schur multiplier, the exterior product and the tensor square of a d-generator special p-group  G  when  |G'|=p^{\frac{1}{2}d(d-1)-1} for  d\geq 3  and  p\neq 2.  Additionally, when  G  is of exponent  p,  we give the structure of  G.
