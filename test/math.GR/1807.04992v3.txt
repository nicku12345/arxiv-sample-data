Let G be a group. A subset F \subset G is called irreducibly faithful if there exists an irreducible unitary representation \pi of G such that \pi(x) \neq \mathrm{id} for all x \in F \smallsetminus \{e\}. Otherwise F is called irreducibly unfaithful. Given a positive integer n, we say that G has Property P(n) if every subset of size n is irreducibly faithful. Every group has P(1), by a classical result of Gelfand and Raikov. Walter proved that every group has P(2). It is easy to see that some groups do not have P(3).   We provide a complete description of the irreducibly unfaithful subsets of size n in a countable group G (finite or infinite) with Property P(n-1): it turns out that such a subset is contained in a finite elementary abelian normal subgroup of G of a particular kind. We deduce a characterization of Property P(n) purely in terms of the group structure. It follows that, if a countable group G has P(n-1) and does not have P(n), then n is the cardinality of a projective space over a finite field.   A group G has Property Q(n) if, for every subset F \subset G of size at most n, there exists an irreducible unitary representation \pi of G such that \pi(x) \ne \pi(y) for any distinct x, y in F. Every group has Q(2). For countable groups, it is shown that Property Q(3) is equivalent to P(3), Property Q(4) to P(6), and Property Q(5) to P(9). For m, n \ge 4, the relation between Properties P(m) and Q(n) is closely related to a well-documented open problem in additive combinatorics.
