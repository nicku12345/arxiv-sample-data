For a finite group G, let d(G) denote the minimal number of elements required to generate G. In this paper, given a finite almost simple group G and any maximal subgroup H of G, we determine a precise upper bound for d(H). In particular, we show that d(H)\leq 5, and that d(H)\geq 4 if and only if H occurs in a known list. This improves a result of Burness, Liebeck and Shalev. The method involves the theory of crowns in finite groups.
