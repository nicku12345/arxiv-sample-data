We construct examples of finitely generated infinite simple groups of homeomorphisms of the real line. Equivalently, these are examples of finitely generated simple left (or right) orderable groups. This answers a well known open question of Rhemtulla from 1980 concerning the existence of such groups. In fact, our construction provides a family of continuum many isomorphism types of groups with these properties.
