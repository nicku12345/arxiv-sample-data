The degree pattern of a finite group is the degree sequence of its prime graph in ascending order of vertices. We say that the problem of OD-characterization is solved for a finite group if we determine the number of pairwise nonisomorphic finite groups with the same order and degree pattern as the group under consideration. In this article the problem of OD-characterization is solved for some simple unitary groups. It was shown, in particular, that the simple unitary groups U_3(q) and U_4(q) are OD-characterizable, where q is a prime power <10^2.
