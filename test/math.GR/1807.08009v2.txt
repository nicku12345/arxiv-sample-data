We study the Cantor--Bendixson rank of the space of subgroups for members of a general class of finitely generated self-replicating branch groups. In particular, we show for G either the Grigorchuk group or the Gupta--Sidki 3 group, the Cantor--Bendixson rank of \mathrm{Sub}(G) is \omega. For each natural number n, we additionally characterize the subgroups of rank n and give a description of subgroups in the perfect kernel.
