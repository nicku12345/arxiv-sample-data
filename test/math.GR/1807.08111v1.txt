In this paper we consider all groups of order dividing p^5. We obtain the explicit structure of the non-abelian tensor square, non-abelian exterior square, tensor center, exterior center, the third homotopy group of suspension of an Eilenberg-MacLain space k(G,1)  and \triangledown(G) of such groups.
