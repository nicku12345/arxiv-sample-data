A subgroup H of a group G is said to be a TNI-subgroup if N_{G}(H)\cap H^g=1 for any g\in G\,\backslash \,N_{G}(H). Let A be an abelian group acting coprimely on the finite group G by automorphisms in such a way that C_G(A)=\{g\in G : g^a=g \, for all a\in A\} is a solvable TNI-subgroup of G. We prove that G is a solvable group with Fitting length h(G) is at most h(C_G(A))+\ell(A). In particular h(G)\leq \ell(A)+3 whenever C_G(A) is nonnormal. Here, h(G) is the Fitting length of G and \ell(A) is the number of primes dividing A counted with multiplicities.
