For a group G we consider the classifying space E_{\mathcal{VC}yc}(G) for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups. We show that an Artin group admits a finite model for E_{\mathcal{VC}yc}(G) if and only if it is virtually cyclic. This solves a conjecture of Juan-Pineda and Leary and a question of L\"uck-Reich-Rognes-Varisco for Artin groups. We then study the conjugacy growth of CAT(0) groups and show that if a CAT(0) group contains a free abelian group of rank two, its conjugacy growth is strictly faster than linear. This also yields an alternative proof for the fact that a CAT(0) cube group admits a finite model for E_{\mathcal{VC}yc}(G) if and only if it is virtually cyclic. Our last result deals with the homotopy type of the quotient space B_{\mathcal{VC}yc}(G) = E_{\mathcal{VC}yc}(G)/G. We show for a poly-\mathbb Z-group G, that B_{\mathcal{VC}yc}(G) is homotopy equivalent to a finite CW-complex if and only if G is cyclic.
