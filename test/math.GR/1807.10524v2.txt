We generalize Gruber--Sisto's construction of the coned--off graph of a small cancellation group to build a partially ordered set \mathcal{TC} of cobounded actions of a given small cancellation group whose smallest element is the action on the Gruber--Sisto coned--off graph. In almost all cases \mathcal{TC} is incredibly rich: it has a largest element if and only if it has exactly 1 element, and given any two distinct comparable actions [G\curvearrowright X] \preceq [G\curvearrowright Y] in this poset, there is an embeddeding \iota:P(\omega)\to\mathcal{TC} such that \iota(\emptyset)=[G\curvearrowright X] and \iota(\mathbb N)=[G\curvearrowright Y]. We use this poset to prove that there are uncountably many quasi--isometry classes of finitely generated group which admit two cobounded acylindrical actions on hyperbolic spaces such that there is no action on a hyperbolic space which is larger than both.
