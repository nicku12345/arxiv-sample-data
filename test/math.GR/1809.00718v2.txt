In the 1940's Graham Higman initiated the study of finite subgroups of the unit group of an integral group ring. Since then many fascinating aspects of this structure have been discovered. Major questions such as the Isomorphism Problem and the Zassenhaus Conjectures have been settled, leading to many new challenging problems. In this survey we review classical and recent results, sketch methods and list questions relevant for the state of the art.
