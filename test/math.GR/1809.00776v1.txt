The study of the poset of hyperbolic structures on a group G was initiated in a paper by C.Abbott, S.Balasubramanya and D.Osin. However, this poset is still very far from being understood and several questions remain unanswered. In this paper, we give a complete description of the poset of hyperbolic structures on the lamplighter groups and obtain some partial results about more general wreath products. As a consequence of this result, we answer two open questions regarding quasi-parabolic structures: we give an example of a group with an uncountable chain of quasi-parabolic structures and prove that the Lamplighter groups all have finitely many quasi-parabolic structures.
