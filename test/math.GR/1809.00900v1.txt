In this article we determine the number of isotopic classes of transversals of a subgroup of order 2 in  D_{2n} (n is a positive odd integer greater than 1), where isotopism classes are formed with respect to the induced right loop structures. We also determine the cyclic index of the Affine group Aff(1,p^{2}), where p is an odd prime.
