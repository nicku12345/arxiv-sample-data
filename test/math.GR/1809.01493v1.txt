Let G be the fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with Noetherian edges and locally tame vertices. We prove that G is locally tame. It follows that if a finitely presented group H has a non-trivial JSJ-decomposition over the class of its VPC(k) subgroups for k=1 or k=2, and all the vertex groups in the decomposition are flexible, then H is locally tame.
