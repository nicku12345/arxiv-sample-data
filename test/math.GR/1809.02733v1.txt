For an element g of a group G, an Engel sink is a subset \mathscr{E}(g) such that for every  x\in G  all sufficiently long commutators  [x,g,g,\ldots,g]  belong to \mathscr{E}(g). Let q be a prime, let m be a positive integer and A an elementary abelian group of order q^2 acting coprimely on a finite group G. We show that if for each nontrivial element a in  A and every element g\in C_{G}(a) the cardinality of the smallest Engel sink \mathscr{E}(g) is at most m, then the order of \gamma_\infty(G) is bounded in terms of m only. Moreover we prove that if for each a\in A\setminus \{1\} and every element g\in C_{G}(a), the smallest Engel sink \mathscr{E}(g) generates a subgroup of rank at most m, then the rank of \gamma_\infty(G) is bounded in terms of m and q only.
