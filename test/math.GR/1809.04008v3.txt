We study the question of whether it is possible to determine a finitely generated group G up to some notion of equivalence from the spectrum \mathrm{sp}(G) of G. We show that the answer is "No" in a strong sense. As the first example we present the collection of amenable 4-generated groups G_\omega, \omega\in\{0,1,2\}^\mathbb N, constructed by the second author in 1984. We show that among them there is a continuum of pairwise non-quasi-isometric groups with \mathrm{sp}(G_\omega)=[-\tfrac{1}{2},0]\cup[\tfrac{1}{2},1]. Moreover, for each of these groups G_\omega there is a continuum of covering groups G with the same spectrum. As the second example we construct a continuum of 2-generated torsion-free step-3 solvable groups with the spectrum [-1,1]. In addition, in relation to the above results we prove a version of Hulanicki Theorem about inclusion of spectra for covering graphs.
