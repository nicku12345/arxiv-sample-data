We prove that the mapping torus of a graph immersion has a word-hyperbolic fundamental group if and only if the corresponding endomorphism does not produce Baumslag-Solitar subgroups. Due to a result by Reynolds, this theorem applies to all injective endomorphisms of F_2 and nonsurjective fully irreducible endomorphisms of F_n. We also give a framework for extending the theorem to all injective endomorphisms of F_n.
