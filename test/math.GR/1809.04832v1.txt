In this paper we investigate commuting involution graphs in classical affine Weyl groups. Let W be a classical Weyl group of rank n, with \tilde W its corresponding affine Weyl group. Our main result is that if X is a conjugacy class of involutions in \tilde W, then the commuting involution graph \mathcal{C}(\tilde W, X) is either disconnected or has diameter at most n+2. This bound is known to hold for types \tilde A_n and \tilde C_n, so the main work of this paper is to prove the theorem for types \tilde B_n and \tilde D_n.
