The genus spectrum of a finite group G is a set of integers g \geq 2 such that G acts on a closed orientable compact surface \Sigma_g of genus g preserving the orientation. In this paper we complete the study of spectrum sets of finite p-groups of co-class 1, where p is an odd prime. As a consequence we prove that given an order p^n and exponent p^e, there are at the most eight genus spectrum despite the infinite growth of their isomorphism types along (n,e). Based on these results we also classify these groups which has unique stable upper genus \sigma_e(p^e) - p^e, where \sigma_e(p) is a constant that depends on p and e.
