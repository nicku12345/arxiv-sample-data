Any Neumann quasigroup (Q, \cdot) (quasigroup with Neumann identity  x \cdot(yz \cdot yx) = z is called Neumann quasigroup) can be presented in the form x\cdot y = x-y, where (Q, +) is an abelian group. Automorphism group of Neumann quasigroup coincides with the group Aut(Q, +). Any Schweizer quasigroup (quasigroup with Schweizer identity xy \cdot xz = zy is called Schweizer quasigroup) is a Neumann quasigroup and vice versa. Any Neumann quasigroup is a GA-quasigroup.
