Let G be a finite group, \pi be a set of primes, and define H_{\pi}(G) to be the subgroup generated by all elements of G which do not have prime order for every prime in \pi. In this paper, we investigate some basic properties of H_{\pi}(G) and its relationship to the Hughes subgroup. We show that for most groups, only one of three possibilities occur: H_{\pi}(G) = 1, H_{\pi}(G)=G, or H_{\pi}(G) = H_{p}(G) for some prime p \in \pi. There is only one other possibility: G is a Frobenius group whose Frobenius complement has prime order p, and whose Frobenius kernel, F, is a nonabelian q-group such that H_{\pi}(G) arises as a proper and nontrivial Hughes subgroup of F. We investigate a few restrictions on the possible choices of the primes p and q.
