Let G be a p-group and let \chi be an irreducible character of G. The codegree of \chi is given by |G:\text{ker}(\chi)|/\chi(1). If G is a maximal class p-group that is normally monomial or has at most three character degrees then the codegrees of G are consecutive powers of p. If |G|=p^n and G has consecutive p-power codegrees up to p^{n-1} then the nilpotence class of G is at most 2 or G has maximal class.
