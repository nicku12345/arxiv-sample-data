The functions F_{G}(n) measures the asymptotic behavior of residual finiteness for a finitely generated group G. In previous work \cite{Pengitore_1}, the author claimed a characterization for F_{N}(n) when N is a finitely generated nilpotent group. However, a counterexample to the above claim was communicated to the author, and subsequently, the statement of the asymptotic characterization of F_{N}(n) is incorrect. In this article, we introduce new tools to provide lower asymptotic bounds for F_{N}(n) when N is a finitely generated nilpotent group. Moreover, we introduce a class of finitely generated nilpotent groups for which the upper bound of \cite{Pengitore_1} can be improved. Finally, we construct of a class of finitely generated nilpotent groups N for which the asymptotic behavior of F_N(n) can be fully characterized.
