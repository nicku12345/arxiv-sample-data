M.Newman has asked if it is the case that whenever H and K are isomorphic subgroups of a finite solvable group G with H maximal, then K is also maximal. This question was considered in a paper of I.M. Isaacs and the second author, where (among other things) the answer was shown to be affirmative if H has an Abelian Sylow 2-subgroup. Here, we show that the answer is affirmative unless the index of H is a power of a prime less than 5 and we obtain further restrictions on the structure of a purported minimal counterexample.
