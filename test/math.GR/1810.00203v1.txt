Professor Graham Higman defined januarial as a special instance of map constructed from embedding of a coset diagram for an action of \Delta (2,\ell ,k), on finite sets yielding exactly two orbits of the product of the two generators, having equal sizes. In this paper we determine a condition for the existence of a januarial from \Delta (2,\ell ,k), the quotients of Hecke groups H_{\Lambda _{\ell }}, when acting on the projective lines over finite fields PL(F_{q}). We develope a method to find all the januarials from Hecke groups H_{\Lambda _{\ell }}, when the triangle group \Delta (2,\ell ,k) acts on PL(F_{q}). We evelove a formula for calculating genus of coset diagram depending on the fixed points. By using it, we determine genus of the januarials.
