We prove the pro-p version of the Karras, Pietrowski, Solitar, Cohen and Scott result stating that a virtually free group acts on a tree with finite vertex stabilizers. If a virtually free pro-p group G has finite centralizes of all non-trivial torsion elements more stronger statement is proved: G embeds into a free pro-p product of a free pro-p group and finite p-group. The integral p-adic representation theory is used in the proof; it replaces the Stallings theory of ends in the pro-p case.
