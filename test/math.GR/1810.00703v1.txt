This is a short introduction (in Spanish) to the study of growth in finite groups, with SL_2 as an example. Emphasis is put on developments of the decade 2005--2015, originating partly in combinatorics. Little algebraic-geometrical background is assumed, but the proofs are nevertheless presented in a relatively abstract and generalizable way.
