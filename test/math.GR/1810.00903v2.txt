We show that there is no uniform polynomial isoperimetric function for finitely presented subgroups of direct products of free groups, by producing a sequence of subgroups G_r\leq F_2^{(1)} \times \dots \times F_2^{(r)} of direct products of 2-generated free groups with Dehn functions bounded below by n^{r}. The groups G_r are obtained from the examples of non-coabelian subdirect products of free groups constructed by Bridson, Howie, Miller and Short. As a consequence we obtain that residually free groups do not admit a uniform polynomial isoperimetric function.
