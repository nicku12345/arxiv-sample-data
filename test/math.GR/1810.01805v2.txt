We introduce a model for random groups in varieties of n-periodic groups as n-periodic quotients of triangular random groups. We show that for an explicit d_{\mathrm{crit}}\in(1/3,1/2), for densities d\in(1/3,d_{\mathrm{crit}}) and for n large enough, the model produces \emph{infinite} n-periodic groups. As an application, we obtain, for every fixed large enough n, for every p\in (1,\infty) an infinite n-periodic group with fixed points for all isometric actions on L^p-spaces. Our main contribution is to show that certain random triangular groups are uniformly acylindrically hyperbolic.
