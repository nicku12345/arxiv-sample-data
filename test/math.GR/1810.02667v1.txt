This thesis takes Brady's construction of K(\pi,1)s for the braid groups as a starting point. It is widely known that this construction can - with the right ingredients - be generalized to Artin groups of finite type. Results of Bessis as well as Brady and Watt are used to establish the general construction for Artin groups of finite type. The non-crossing partition lattice in finite Coxeter groups is identified and used to generate the so called poset group. With the help of this poset group, which turns out to be isomorphic to the Artin group, a simplicial complex is constructed on which the poset group acts. It is shown that the complex itself is the universal cover of the K(\pi,1) of the Artin group of finite type and the quotient under the action is the desired K(\pi,1).
