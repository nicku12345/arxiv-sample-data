In a group G, elements a and b are conjugate if there exists g\in G such that g^{-1} ag=b. This conjugacy relation, which plays an important role in group theory, can be extended in a natural way to inverse semigroups: for elements a and b in an inverse semigroup S, a is conjugate to b, which we will write as a\sim_{\mathrm{i}} b, if there exists g\in S^1 such that g^{-1} ag=b and gbg^{-1} =a. The purpose of this paper is to study the conjugacy \sim_{\mathrm{i}} in several classes of inverse semigroups: symmetric inverse semigroups, free inverse semigroups, McAllister P-semigroups, factorizable inverse monoids, Clifford semigroups, the bicyclic monoid and stable inverse semigroups.
