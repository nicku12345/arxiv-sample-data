A group G has cube-free order if no prime to the third power divides |G|. We describe an algorithm that given two cube-free groups G and H of known order, decides whether G\cong H, and, if so, constructs an isomorphism G\to H. If the groups are input as permutation groups, then our algorithm runs in time polynomial in the input size, improving on the previous super-polynomial bound. An implementation of our algorithm is provided for the computer algebra system {\sf GAP}.
