For a group G, let \Gamma(G) denote the graph defined on the elements of G in such a way that two distinct vertices are connected by an edge if and only if they generate G. Moreover let \Gamma^*(G) be the subgraph of \Gamma(G) that is induced by all the vertices of \Gamma(G) that are not isolated. We prove that if G is a 2-generated non-cyclic abelian group then \Gamma^*(G) is connected. Moreover \mathrm{diam}(\Gamma^*(G))=2 if the torsion subgroup of G is non-trivial and \mathrm{diam}(\Gamma^*(G))=\infty otherwise. If F is the free group of rank 2, then \Gamma^*(F) is connected and we deduce from \mathrm{diam}(\Gamma^*(\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}))=\infty that \mathrm{diam}(\Gamma^*(F))=\infty.
