We generalize the positive solution of the Frobenius conjecture and refinements thereof by studying the structure of groups that admit a fix-point-free automorphism satisfying an identity.   We show, in particular, that for every polynomial r(t) = a_0 + a_1 \cdot t + \cdots + a_d \cdot t^d \in \mathbb{Z}[t] that is irreducible over \mathbb{Q}, there exist (explicit) invariants a,b,c \in \mathbb{N} with the following property. Consider a finite group with a fix-point-free automorphism {\alpha}:{G}\longrightarrow{G} and suppose that for all x \in G we have the equality x^{a_0} \cdot \alpha(x^{a_1}) \cdot \alpha^2(x^{a_2})\cdots \alpha^d(x^{a_d}) = 1_G. Then G is solvable and of the form A \cdot (B \rtimes (C \times D)), where A is an a-group, B is a b-group, C is a nilpotent c-group, and D is a nilpotent group of class at most d^{2^d}. Here, a group H is said to be an a-group (resp. b-group or c-group) if the order of every h \in H divides some natural power of a (resp. b or c).
