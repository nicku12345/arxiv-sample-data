Near-openly generated groups are introduced. It is a topological and multiplicative subclass of \mathbb R-factorizable groups. Dense and open subgroups, quotients and Raikov completion of a near-openly generated group are near-openly generated. Almost connected pro-Lie groups, lindel\" off almost metrizable groups and the spaces C_p(X) of all continuous real-valued functions on a Tychonoff space X with pointwise convergence topology are near-openly generated.   We provide characterizations of near-openly generated groups using methods of inverse spectra and topological game theory.
