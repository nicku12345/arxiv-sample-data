Conformal dimension is one of the important geometric quantities attached to a metric space. It is well known that if two Gromov hyperbolic groups are quasi-isometric, then conformal dimensions (of the canonical conformal gauge) of their Gromov boundaries are equal. In recent years it has been seen that there are some geometric properties of groups which are invariant under L^p-measure equivalence (L^p-ME) or L^p-orbit equivalence (L^p-OE). L^p-ME or L^p-OE has been studied for some classes of hyperbolic groups, for lattices in Isom(\mathbb{H}^n) (n\geq 3) by U. Bader, A. Furman and R. Sauer , for free groups by L. Bowen. In this article we start to investigate for Gromov Hyperbolic groups. In this article, we prove that for hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) Coxeter groups with boundaries having Combinatorial Loewner Property, conformal dimension (of the canonical conformal gauge) of the Gromov boundary is invariant under L^p-OE for some large p.
