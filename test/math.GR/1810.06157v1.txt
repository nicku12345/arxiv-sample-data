Let G be a split reductive algebraic group defined over a complete discrete valuation ring \mathbb{O}, with residue field \mathbb{F} and fraction field \mathbb{K}, where the fiber G_{\mathbb{F}} is geometrically standard. A balanced nilpotent section x \in \text{Lie}(G) can roughly be thought of as an \mathbb{O}-point in a \mathbb{K} nilpotent orbit such that the corresponding orbits over \mathbb{K} and \mathbb{F} have the same Bala--Carter label. In this paper, we will establish a number of results on the structure of the centralizer G^x \subseteq G of x. This includes a proof that G^x is a smooth group scheme, and that the component groups of its geometric fibers are isomorphic.
