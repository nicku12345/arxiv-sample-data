We study the dilatation of outer automorphisms of right-angled Artin groups. Given a right-angled Artin group defined on a simplicial graph: A(\Gamma) = \langle V | E \rangle and an automorphism \phi \in Out(A(\Gamma)) there is a natural measure of how fast the length of a word of A(\Gamma) grows after n iterations of \phi as a function of n, which we call the dilatation of w under \phi. We define the dilatation of \phi as the supremum over dilatations of all w \in A(\Gamma). Assuming that \phi is a pure and square map, we show that if the dilatation of \phi is positive, then either there exists a free abelian special subgroup on which that dilatation is realized; or there exists a strata of either free or free abelian groups on which the dilatation is realized.
