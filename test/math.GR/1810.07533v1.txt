Let A be a set and f:A\rightarrow A a bijective function. Necessary and sufficient conditions on f are determined which makes it possible to endow A with a binary operation * such that (A,*) is a cyclic group and f\in \mbox{Aut}(A). This result is extended to all abelian groups in case |A|=p^2, \ p a prime. Finally, in case A is countably infinite, those f for which it is possible to turn A into a group (A,*) isomorphic to {\Bbb Z}^n for some n\ge 1, and with f\in \mbox{Aut} (A), are completely characterised.
