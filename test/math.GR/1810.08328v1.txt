T\u{a}rn\u{a}uceanu described the finite groups G having exactly |G|-1 cyclic subgroups. In "Finite Groups with a Prescribed Number of Cyclic Subgroups,", we used elementary methods to completely characterize those finite groups G having exactly |G|-\Delta cyclic subgroups for \Delta=2, 3, 4 and 5. In this paper, we prove that for any \Delta >0 if G has exactly |G|-\Delta cyclic subgroups, then |G|\le 8\Delta and therefore the number of such G is finite. We then use the computer program GAP to find all G with exactly |G|-\Delta cyclic subgroups for \Delta=1,\ldots,32.
