Let \hat G be the finite simply connected version of an exceptional Chevalley group, and let V be a nontrivial irreducible module, of minimal dimension, for \hat G over its field of definition. We explore the overgroup structure of \hat G in \mathrm{GL}(V), and the submodule structure of the exterior square (and sometimes the third Lie power) of V. When \hat G is defined over a field of odd prime order p, this allows us to construct the smallest (with respect to certain properties) p-groups P such that the group induced by \mathrm{Aut}(P) on P/\Phi(P) is either \hat G or its normaliser in \mathrm{GL}(V).
