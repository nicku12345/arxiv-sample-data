We show that uniform approximate lattices in nilpotent Lie groups are subsets of model sets. This extends a theorem due to Yves Meyer about quasicrystals in Euclidean spaces. To do so we study relatively dense subsets of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups and their logarithms. We then deduce a simple criterion for the existence of an approximate lattice in a given nilpotent Lie group.
