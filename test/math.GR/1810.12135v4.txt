It is shown that the strong Atiyah conjecture and the L\"uck approximation conjecture in the space of marked groups hold for locally indicable groups. In particular, this implies that one-relator groups satisfy both conjectures. We also show that the center conjecture, the independence conjecture and the strong eigenvalue conjecture hold for these groups.   As a byproduct we prove that the group algebra of a locally indicable group over a field of characteristic zero has a Hughes-free epic division algebra and, in particular, it is embedded in a division algebra.
