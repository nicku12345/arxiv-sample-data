A left-order on a group G is a total order < on G such that for any f, g and h in G we have f < g \Leftrightarrow hf < hg. We construct a finitely generated subgroup G of \operatorname{Homeo} (I^2;\delta I^2), the group of those homeomorphisms of the disc that fix the boundary pointwise, and show G does not admit a left-order. Since any left-order on \operatorname{Homeo} (I^2;\delta I^2) would restrict to a left-order on G this shows that \operatorname{Homeo} (I^2;\delta I^2) does not admit a left-order. Since \operatorname{Homeo} (I;\delta I) admits a left-order it follows that neither G nor \operatorname{Homeo} (I^2;\delta I^2) embed in \operatorname{Homeo} (I;\delta I).
