In this paper we have examined hyperbolicity and relative hyperbolicity of \Gamma_n := \mathsf{Out}(G_n) , where G_n = A_1*...*A_n, is a finite free product and each A_i is a finite group. We have used the \mathsf{Out}(G_n) action on the Guirardel-Levitt deformation space, to find a virtual generating set and prove quasi isometric embedding of a large class of subgroups. We have used ideas from works of Mosher-Handel and Alibegovi\'c to prove non-distortion. We have used these subgroups to prove that \Gamma_n is thick for higher complexities. Thickness was developed by Behrstock-Dru\c{t}u-Mosher and thickness implies that the groups are non-relatively hyperbolic.
