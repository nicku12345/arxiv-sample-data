For each family of finite classical groups, and their associated simple quotients, we provide an explicit presentation on a specific generating set of size at most 8. Since there exist efficient algorithms to construct this generating set in any copy of the group, our presentations can be used to verify claimed isomorphisms between representations of the classical group. The presentations are available in Magma.
