In this note we show that for any powerful p-group G, the subgroup \Omega_{i}(G^{p^{j}}) is powerfully nilpotent for all i,j\geq1 when p is an odd prime, and i\geq1, j\geq2 when p=2. We provide an example to show why this modification is needed in the case p=2. Furthermore we obtain a bound on the powerful nilpotency class of \Omega_{i}(G^{p^{j}}). We give an example to show that powerfully nilpotent characteristic subgroups of powerful p-groups need not be strongly powerful.
