Let G be a finite group, and let {\rm{cd}}(G) denote the set of degrees of the irreducible complex characters of G. The degree graph \Delta(G) of G is defined as the simple undirected graph whose vertex set {\rm{V}}(G) consists of the prime divisors of the numbers in {\rm{cd}}(G), two distinct vertices p and q being adjacent if and only if pq divides some number in {\rm{cd}}(G). In this note, we provide an upper bound on the size of {\rm{V}}(G) in terms of the clique number \omega(G) (i.e., the maximum size of a subset of {\rm{V}}(G) inducing a complete subgraph) of \Delta(G). Namely, we show that |{\rm{V}}(G)|\leq{\rm{max}}\{2\omega(G)+1,\;3\omega(G)-4\}. Examples are given in order to show that the bound is best possible. This completes the analysis carried out in [1] where the solvable case was treated, extends the results in [3,4,9], and answers a question posed by the first author and H.P. Tong-Viet in [4].
