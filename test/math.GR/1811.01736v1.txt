The goal of this paper is to generalize several group theoretic concepts such as the center and commutator subgroup, central series, and ultimately nilpotence to a supercharacter theoretic setting, and to use these concepts to show that there can be a strong connection between the structure of a group and the structure of its supercharacter theories. We then use these concepts to show that the upper and lower annihilator series of J can be described in terms of certain central series for the algebra group G=1+J defined by \mathsf{S}, when \mathsf{S} is the algebra group supercharacter theory defined by Diaconis--Isaacs.
