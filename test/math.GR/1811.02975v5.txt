In this paper we study group actions on quasi-median graphs, or 'CAT(0) prism complexes', generalising the notion of CAT(0) cube complexes. We consider hyperplanes in a quasi-median graph X and define the contact graph \mathcal{C}X for these hyperplanes. We show that \mathcal{C}X is always quasi-isometric to a tree, generalising a result of Hagen, and that under certain conditions a group action G \curvearrowright X induces an acylindrical action G \curvearrowright \mathcal{C}X, giving a quasi-median analogue of a result of Behrstock, Hagen and Sisto.   As an application, we exhibit an acylindrical action of a graph product on a quasi-tree, generalising results of Kim and Koberda for right-angled Artin groups. We show that for many graph products G, the action we exhibit is the 'largest' acylindrical action of G on a hyperbolic metric space. We use this to show that the graph products of equationally noetherian groups over finite graphs of girth \geq 6 are equationally noetherian, generalising a result of Sela.
