Let G be a p-group and let \chi be an irreducible character of G. The codegree of \chi is given by |G:\text{ker}(\chi)|/\chi(1). This paper investigates the relationship between the nilpotence class of a group and the inclusion of p^2 as a codegree. If G is a finite p-group with coclass 2 and order at least p^5, or coclass 3 and order at least p^6, then G has p^2 as a codegree. With an additional hypothesis this result can be extended to p-groups with coclass n\ge 3 and order at least p^{2n}.
