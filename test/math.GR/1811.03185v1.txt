We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the group of a rational maximal bifix code Z to be isomorphic with the F-group of Z\cap F, when F is recurrent and Z\cap F is rational. The case where F is uniformly recurrent, which is known to imply the finiteness of Z\cap F, receives special attention.   The proofs are done by exploring the connections with the structure of the free profinite monoid over the alphabet of F.
