Let  G  be a finite non-solvable group with a primitive irreducible character  \chi  that vanishes on one conjugacy class. We show that  G  has a homomorphic image that is either almost simple or a Frobenius group. We also classify such groups  G  with a composition factor isomorphic to a sporadic group, an alternating group  \rm{A}_{n} ,  n\geq 5  or  \rm{PSL}_{2}(q) , where  q\geq 4  is a prime power, when  \chi  is faithful. Our results partially answer a question of Dixon and Rahnamai Barghi.
