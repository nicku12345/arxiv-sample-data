S. S. Magliveras et al. have described symmetric and public key cryptosystems based on logarithmic signatures (also known as group bases) for finite permutation groups.   In this paper we show that if G is a nontrivial finite group which is not cyclic of order a prime, or the square of a prime, then the round (or encryption) functions of these systems, that are the permutations of G induced by the exact-transversal logarithmic signatures (also known as transversal group bases), generate the full symmetric group on G.   This answers a question of S. S. Magliveras, D.R. Stinson and Tran van Trung.
