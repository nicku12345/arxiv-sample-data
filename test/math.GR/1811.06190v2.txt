We present a new algorithm that, given two matrices in GL(n,Q), decides if they are conjugate in GL(n,Z) and, if so, determines a conjugating matrix. We also give an algorithm to construct a generating set for the centraliser in GL(n,Z) of a matrix in GL(n,Q). We do this by reducing these problems respectively to the isomorphism and automorphism group problems for certain modules over rings of the form \mathcal O_K[y]/(y^l), where \mathcal O_K is the maximal order of an algebraic number field and l \in N, and then provide algorithms to solve the latter. The algorithms are practical and our implementations are publicly available in Magma.
