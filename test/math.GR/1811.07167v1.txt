It is proved that any countable abelian group D can be embedded as a centre into a m-generated group A such that the quotient group A/D is isomorphic to the free Burnside group B(m,n) of rank m>1 and of odd period n\ge665. The proof is based on some modification of the method which was used by S.I.Adian in his monograph in 1975 for a positive solution of Kontorovich's famous problem from Kourovka Notebook on the existence of a finitely generated non-commutative analogue of the additive group of rational numbers. More precisely, he proved that the desired analogues in which the intersection of any two non-trivial subgroups is infinite, can be constructed as a central extension of the free Burnside group  B (m, n) , where  m> 1 , and  n \ge665  is an odd number, using as its center the infinite cyclic group. The paper also discusses other applications of the proposed generalization of Adian's technique. In particular, we describe the free groups of the variety defined by the identity [x^n,y]=1 and the Schur multipliers of the free Burnside groups B(m,n) for any odd n\ge665.
