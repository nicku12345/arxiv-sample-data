A result of Gersten states that if G is a hyperbolic group with integral cohomological dimension \mathsf{cd}_{\mathbb{Z}}(G)=2 then every finitely presented subgroup is hyperbolic. We generalize this result for the rational case \mathsf{cd}_{\mathbb{Q}}(G)=2. In particular, our result applies to the class of torsion-free hyperbolic groups G with \mathsf{cd}_{\mathbb{Z}}(G)=3 and \mathsf{cd}_{\mathbb{Q}}(G)=2 discovered by Bestvina and Mess.
