Let X be a proper geodesic metric space. We give a new construction of the Morse Boundary that realizes its points as equivalence classes of functions on X which behave similar to the "distance to a point" function. When G=\langle S \rangle  is a finitely generated group and X=Cay(G,S), we use this construction to give a symbolic presentation of the Morse boundary as a space of "derivatives" on Cay(G,S). The collection of such derivatives naturally embeds in the shift space \mathcal{A}^G for some finite set \mathcal{A}.
