A subset \{g_1, \ldots , g_d\} of a finite group G is said to invariably generate G if the set \{g_1^{x_1}, \ldots, g_d^{x_d}\} generates G for every choice of x_i \in G. The Chebotarev invariant C(G) of G is the expected value of the random variable n that is minimal subject to the requirement that n randomly chosen elements of G invariably generate G. The authors recently showed that for each \epsilon>0, there exists a constant c_{\epsilon} such that C(G)\le (1+\epsilon)\sqrt{|G|}+c_{\epsilon}. This bound is asymptotically best possible. In this paper we prove a partial converse: namely, for each \alpha>0 there exists an absolute constant \delta_{\alpha} such that if G is a finite group and C(G)>\alpha\sqrt{|G|}, then G has a section X/Y such that |X/Y|\geq \delta_{\alpha}\sqrt{|G|}, and X/Y\cong \mathbb{F}_q\rtimes H for some prime power q, with H\le \mathbb{F}_q^{\times}.
