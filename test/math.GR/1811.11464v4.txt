We study a characteristic subgroup of finitely generated groups, consisting of elements with uniform upper bound for word-lengths. For a group G, we denote this subgroup by G_{bound}. We give sufficient criteria for triviality and finiteness of G_{bound}. We prove that if G is virtually abelian then G_{bound} is finite. In contrast with numerous examples where G_{bound} is trivial, we show that for every finite group A, there exists an infinite group G with G_{bound}=A. This group G can be chosen among torsion groups. We also study the group G_{bound}(d) of elements with uniformly bounded word-lengths for generating sets of cardinality less than d.
