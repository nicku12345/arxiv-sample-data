Hans Zassenhaus conjectured that every torsion unit of the integral group ring of a finite group G is conjugate within the rational group algebra to an element of the form \pm g with g\in G. This conjecture has been disproved recently for metabelian groups, by Eisele and Margolis. However it is known to be true for many classes of solvable groups, as for example nilpotent groups, cyclic-by-abelian groups and groups having a cyclic Sylow subgroup with abelian complement. On the other hand, it is not known whether the conjecture holds for supersolvable groups. This paper is a contribution to this question. More precisely, we study the conjecture for the class of cyclic-by-nilpotent groups with special attention to the class of cyclic-by-Hamiltonian groups. We prove the conjecture for cyclic-by-p-groups and for a large class of cyclic-by-Hamiltonian groups.
