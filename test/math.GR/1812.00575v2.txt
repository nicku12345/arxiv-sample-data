Manevitz and Weinberger proved that the existence of faithful K-Lipschitz \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}-actions implies the existence of faithful K-Lipschitz \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}-actions. The \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}-actions were constructed from suitable actions of a sufficiently large hyperfinite cyclic group {}^{\ast}\mathbb{Z}/\gamma{}^{\ast}\mathbb{Z} in the sense of nonstandard analysis. In this paper, we modify their construction, and prove that the existence of \varepsilon-faithful K-Lipschitz G_{\lambda}-actions implies the existence of \varepsilon-faithful K-Lipschitz \varinjlim G_{\lambda}-actions. In a similar way, we generalise Manevitz and Weinberger's result to injective direct limits of torsion groups.
