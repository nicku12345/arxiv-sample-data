We show that a rank reduction technique for string C-group representations first used for the symmetric groups generalizes to arbitrary settings. The technique permits us, among other things, to prove that orthogonal groups defined on d-dimensional modules over fields of even order greater than 2 possess string C-group representations of all ranks 3\leq r\leq d. The broad applicability of the rank reduction technique provides fresh impetus to construct, for suitable families of groups, string C-groups of highest possible rank. It also suggests that the alternating group {\rm Alt}(11)---the only known group having `rank gaps'---is perhaps more unusual than previously thought.
