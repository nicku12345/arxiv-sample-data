Klopsch and the author have constructed a finitely generated pro-p group G, for p an odd prime, with infinite normal Hausdorff spectrum with respect to the p-power series. They show that the normal Hausdorff spectrum of G contains an infinite interval, which answers a question of Shalev.   They indicate in their paper how their results extend to the case p=2. In this note, we provide all the details for the even case.
