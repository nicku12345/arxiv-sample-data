The word w=[x_{i_1},x_{i_2},\dots,x_{i_k}] is a simple commutator word if k\geq 2, i_1\neq i_2 and i_j\in \{1,\dots,m\}, for some m>1. For a finite group G, we prove that if i_{1} \neq i_j for every j\neq 1, then the verbal subgroup corresponding to w is nilpotent if and only if |ab|=|a||b| for any w-values a,b\in G of coprime orders. We also extend the result to a residually finite group G, provided that the set of all w-values in G is finite.
