We will describe the relationship between the indecomposable characters of the finitary symmetric group and its ergodic invariant random subgroups; and we will interpret each Thoma character as an asymptotic limit of a naturally associated sequence of characters induced from linear characters of Young subgroups of finite symmetric groups.
