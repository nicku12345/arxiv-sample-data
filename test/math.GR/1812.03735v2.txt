We continue study of subgroups of a Chevalley group G_P(\Phi,R) over a ring R with a root system \Phi and a weight lattice P, containing the elementary subgroup E_P(\Phi,K) over a subring K of R. Recently A. Bak and A. Stepanov considered the symplectic case (i. e. the case of simply connected group of type \Phi=C_l) in characteristic 2. In this article we extend their result for groups with arbitrary weight lattice of types B_l and C_l. Similarly to the work of Nuzhin that handles the case of an algebraic extension R of a nonperfect field K of bad characteristic, we use in the description a special kind of carpet subgroups. In the second half of the article we study Bruhat and Gauss decompositions for these carpet subgroups.
