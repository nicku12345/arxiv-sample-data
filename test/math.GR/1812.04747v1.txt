Let G and H be groups that act compatibly on each other. We denote by [G,H] the derivative subgroup of G under H. We prove that if the set \{g^{-1}g^h \mid g \in G, h \in H\} has m elements, then the derivative [G,H] is finite with m-bounded order. Moreover, we show that if the set of all tensors T_{\otimes}(G,H) = \{g\otimes h \mid g \in G, h\in H\} has m elements, then the non-abelian tensor product G \otimes H is finite with m-bounded order. We also examine some finiteness conditions for the non-abelian tensor square of groups.
