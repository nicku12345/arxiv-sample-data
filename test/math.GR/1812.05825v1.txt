The spectrum \omega(G) of a finite group G is the set of orders of elements of G. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a finite set \mathcal M of positive integers, outputs either an empty set or a finite simple group G. In the former case, there is no finite simple group H with \mathcal{M}=\omega(H), while in the latter case, \mathcal{M}\subseteq\omega(G) and \mathcal{M}\neq\omega(H) for all finite simple groups H with \omega(H)\neq\omega(G).
