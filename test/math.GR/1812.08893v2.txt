Suppose G is a 1-ended finitely presented group that is hyperbolic relative to \mathcal P a finite collection of 1-ended finitely presented proper subgroups of G. Our main theorem states that if the boundary \partial (G,{\mathcal P}) is locally connected and the second cohomology group H^2(P,\mathbb ZP) is free abelian for each P\in \mathcal P, then H^2(G,\mathbb ZG) is free abelian. When G is 1-ended it is conjectured that \partial (G,\mathcal P) is always locally connected. Under mild conditions on G and the members of \mathcal P the 1-ended and local connectivity hypotheses can be eliminated and the same conclusion is obtained. When G and each member of \mathcal P is 1-ended and \partial (G,\mathcal P) is locally connected, we prove that the "Cusped Space" for this pair has semistable fundamental group at \infty. This provides a starting point in our proof of the main theorem.
