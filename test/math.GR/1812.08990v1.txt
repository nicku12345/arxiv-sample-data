For a prime p, we call a positive integer n a Frobenius p-number if there exists a finite group with exactly n subgroups of order p^a for some a\ge 0. Extending previous results on Sylow's theorem, we prove in this paper that every Frobenius p-number n\equiv 1\pmod{p^2} is a Sylow p-number, i.e., the number of Sylow p-subgroups of some finite group. As a consequence, we verify that 46 is a pseudo Frobenius 3-number, that is, no finite group has exactly 46 subgroups of order 3^a for any a\ge 0.
