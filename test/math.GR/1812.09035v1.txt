We study the structure of the commensurator of a virtually abelian subgroup H in G, where G acts properly on a \mathrm{CAT}(0) space X. When X is a Hadamard manifold and H is semisimple, we show that the commensurator of H coincides with the normalizer of a finite index subgroup of H. When X is a \mathrm{CAT}(0) cube complex or a thick Euclidean building and the action of G is cellular, we show that the commensurator of H is an ascending union of normalizers of finite index subgroups of H. We explore several special cases where the results can be strengthened and we discuss a few examples showing the necessity of various assumptions. Finally, we present some applications to the constructions of classifying spaces with virtually abelian stabilizers.
