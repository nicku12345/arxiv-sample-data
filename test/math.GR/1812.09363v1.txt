The non-centralizer graph of a finite group G is the simple graph \Upsilon_G whose vertices are the elements of G with two vertices x and y are adjacent if their centralizers are distinct. The induced subgroup of \Upsilon_G associated with the vertex set G\setminus Z(G) is called the induced non-centralizer graph of G. The notions of non-centralizer and induced non-centralizer graphs were introduced by Tolue in \cite{to15}. A finite group is called regular (resp. induced regular) if its non-centralizer graph (resp. induced non-centralizer graph) is regular. In this paper we study the structure of regular groups as well as induced regular groups. Among the many obtained results, we prove that if a group G is regular (resp. induced regular) then G/Z(G) as an elementary 2-group (resp. p-group).
