Let G be a finite group of Lie type E_l with l\in\{6,7,8\} over F_q and W be the Weyl group of G. We describe all maximal tori T of G such that T has a complement in its algebraic normalizer N(G,T). Let T correspond to an element w of W. When T does not have a complement, we show that w has a lift in N(G,T) of order |w| in all considered groups, except the simply-connected group E_7(q). In the latter case we describe the elements w that have a lift in N(G,T) of order |w|.
