A limit variety is a variety that is minimal with respect to being non-finitely based. The two limit varieties of Marcel Jackson are the only known examples of limit varieties of aperiodic monoids. Our previous work had shown that there exists a limit subvariety of aperiodic monoids that is different from Marcel Jackson's limit varieties. In this paper, we introduce a new limit variety of aperiodic monoids.
