A finite p-group G is called \textit{powerful} if either p is odd and [G,G]\subseteq G^p or p=2 and [G,G]\subseteq G^4. A {\em{cover}} for a group is a collection of subgroups whose union is equal to the entire group. We will discuss covers of p-groups by powerful p-subgroups. The size of the smallest cover of a p-group by powerful p-subgroups is called the \textit{powerful covering number}. In this paper we determine the powerful covering number of the dihedral 2-groups.
