In this article, we study flag-transitive automorphism groups of non-trivial symmetric (v, k, \lambda) designs, where \lambda divides k and k\geq \lambda^2. We show that such an automorphism group is either point-primitive of affine or almost simple type, or point-imprimitive with parameters v=\lambda^{2}(\lambda+2) and k=\lambda(\lambda+1), for some positive integer \lambda. We also provide some examples in both possibilities.
