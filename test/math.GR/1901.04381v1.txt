A subgroup A of a group~G is said to be {\sl NS-supplemented} in G, if there exists a subgroup~B of G such that G=AB and whenever X~is a normal subgroup of~A and p\in \pi(B), there exists a Sylow p-subgroup~B_p of~B such that XB_p=B_pX. In this paper, we proved the supersolubility of a group with NS-supplemented non-cyclic Sylow subgroups. The solubility of a group with NS-supplemented maximal subgroups is obtained.
