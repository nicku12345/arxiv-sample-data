A generalization of the double commutator lemma for normal subgroups is shown for invariant random subgroups of a countable group acting faithfully on a Hausdorff space. As an application, we classify ergodic invariant random subgroups of topological full groups of Cantor minimal \mathbb{Z}^{d}-systems. Another corollary is that for an ergodic invariant random subgroup of a branch group, a.e. subgroup H must contain derived subgroups of certain rigid stabilizers. Such results can be applied towards classification of invariant random subgroups of Grigorchuk groups.
