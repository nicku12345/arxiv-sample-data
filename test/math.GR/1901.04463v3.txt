The famous Hanna Neumann Conjecture (now the Friedman-Mineyev theorem) gives an upper bound for the ranks of the intersection of arbitrary subgroups H and K of a non-abelian free group. It is an interesting question to `quantify' this bound with respect to the rank of H\vee K, the subgroup generated by H and K. We describe a set of realizable values (rk(H\vee K),rk(H\cap K)) for arbitrary H, K, and conjecture that this locus is complete. We study the combinatorial structure of the topological pushout of the core graphs for H and K, with the help of graphs introduced by Dicks in the context of his Amalgamated Graph Conjecture. This allows us to show that certain conditions on ranks of H\vee K, H\cap K are not realizable, thus resolving the remaining open case m=4 of Guzman's "Group-Theoretic Conjecture" in the affirmative. This in turn implies the validity of the corresponding "Geometric Conjecture" on hyperbolic 3-manifolds with a 6-free fundamental group. Finally, we prove the main conjecture describing the locus of realizable values for the case when rk(H)=2.
