We investigate the question as to when the members of a finite regular semigroup may be permuted in such a way that each member is mapped to one of its inverses. In general this is not possible. However we reformulate the problem in terms of a related graph and, using an application of Hall's Marriage Lemma, we show in particular that the finite full transformation semigroup does enjoy this property.
