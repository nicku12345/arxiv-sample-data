Let  G  be a connected reductive algebraic group over a field  k . We study the group of semilinear automorphisms Aut( G\to Spec k) consisting of algebraic automorphisms of  G  over automorphisms of  k . We focus on the exact sequence  1\to Aut G\to Aut ( G\to Spec k)\to Aut_{G}(k)\to 1 . When G is quasi-split, we show that Aut_{G}(k) is isomorphic to Aut_{\mathcal{R}(G)}(k), where \mathcal{R}(G) denotes the scheme of based root datum of G. Furthermore, the exact sequence  1\to Aut G\to Aut ( G\to Spec k)\to Aut_{G}(k)\to 1  splits if and only if the exact sequence  1\to \text{Aut }\mathcal{R}(G) \to \text{Aut }(\mathcal{R}(G) \to \text{Spec } k)\to \text{Aut}_{\mathcal{R}(G)}(k)\to 1  splits. As a corollary, we get many examples of algebraic groups  G  over  k  whose group of abstract automorphisms does not decompose as the semidirect product of  \text{Aut } G  with \text{Aut}_G(k) . We also study the same questions for inner forms of SL_n  over a local field.
