Let X be a nonempty set and X^{2} be the Cartesian square of X. Some semigroups of binary relations generated partitions of X^2 are studied. In particular, the algebraic structure of semigroups generated by the finest partition of X^{2} and, respectively, by the finest symmetric partition of X^{2} are described.
