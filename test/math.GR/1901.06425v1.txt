For a finite group G, we associate the quantity \beta(G)=\frac{|L(G)|}{|G|}, where L(G) is the subgroup lattice of G. Different properties and problems related to this ratio are studied throughout the paper. We determine the second minimum value of \beta on the class of p-groups of order p^n, where n\geq 3 is an integer. We show that the set containing the quantities \beta(G), where G is a finite (abelian) group, is dense in [0,\infty). Finally, we consider \beta to be a function on L(G) and we mark some of its properties, the main result being the classification of finite abelian p-groups G satisfying \beta(H)\leq 1, \ \forall \ H\in L(G).
