A finite group G is called *uniformly generated*, if whenever there is a (strictly ascending) chain of subgroups 1<\langle x_1\rangle<\langle x_1,x_2\rangle <\cdots<\langle x_1,x_2,\dots,x_d\rangle=G, then d is the minimal number of generators of G. Our main result classifies the uniformly generated groups without using the simple group classification. These groups are related to finite projective geometries by a result of Iwasawa on subgroup lattices.
