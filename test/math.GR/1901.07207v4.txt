For any given n,m \in \mathbb{N} with  m < n , the Johnson graph J(n,m) is defined as the graph whose vertex set is V=\{v\mid v\subseteq [n]=\{1,...,n\}, |v|=m\}, where two vertices v,w are adjacent if and only if |v\cap w|=m-1. A graph G of order n > 2 is panconnected if for every two vertices u and v, there is a u-v path of length l for every integer l with d(u,v) \leq l \leq n-1. In this paper, we prove that the Johnson graph J(n,m) is a panconnected graph.
