The first main result of this paper is that a finite transitive nonabelian characteristically simple subgroup of a wreath product in product action must lie in the base group of the wreath product. This allows us to characterize nonabelian transitive characteristically simple subgroups H of finite quasiprimitive permutation groups G. If the socle of G, denoted by \mbox{soc}(G), is nonabelian, then H lies in \mbox{soc}(G). An explicit description is given for the possibilities of H under the condition that H does not contain a nontrivial normal subgroup of \mbox{soc}(G).
