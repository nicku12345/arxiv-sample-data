Let G be a p-group and let \chi be an irreducible character of G. The codegree of \chi is given by |G:\text{ker}(\chi)|/\chi(1). Du and Lewis have shown that a p-group with exactly three codegrees has nilpotence class at most 2. Here we investigate p-groups with exactly four codegrees. If, in addition to having exactly four codegrees, G has two irreducible character degrees, G has largest irreducible character degree p^2, |G:G'|=p^2, or G has coclass at most 3, then G has nilpotence class at most 4. In the case of coclass at most 3, the order of G is bounded by p^7. With an additional hypothesis we can extend this result to p-groups with four codegrees and coclass at most 7. In this case the order of G is bounded by p^{11}.
