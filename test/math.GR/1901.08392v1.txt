We formulate and explain the extended Burrows-Wheeler transform of Mantaci et al from the viewpoint of permutations on a chain taken as a union of partial order-preserving mappings. In so doing we establish a link with syntactic semigroups of languages that are themselves cyclic semigroups. We apply the extended transform with a view to generating de Bruijn words through inverting the transform.
