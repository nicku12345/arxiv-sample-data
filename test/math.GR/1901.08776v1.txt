This paper enriches the list of properties of the congruence sequences starting from the universal relation and successively performing the operations of lower t and lower k. Three classes of completely regular semigroups, namely semigroups for which \ker{\sigma} is a cryptogroup, semigroups for which \ker{\nu} is a cryptogroup and semigroups for which \kappa is over rectangular bands, are studied. ((\omega_t)_k)_t, ((\mathcal{D}_t)_k)_t and ((\omega_k)_t)_k are found to be the least congruences on S such that the quotient semigroups are semigroups for which \ker{\sigma} is a cryptogroup, \ker{\nu} is a cryptogroup and \kappa is over rectangular bands, respectively. The results obtained present a response to three problems in Petrich and Reilly's textbook \textquoteleft\textquoteleft Completely Regular Semigroups\textquoteright\textquoteright.
