We prove that if G is a finite simple group of Lie type and S_1,\dots, S_k are subsets of G satisfying \prod_{i=1}^k|S_i|\geq|G|^c for some c depending only on the rank of G, then there exist elements g_1,\dots, g_k such that G=(S_1)^{g_1}\cdots (S_k)^{g_k}. This theorem generalizes an earlier theorem of the authors and Short. We also propose two conjectures that relate our result to one of Rodgers and Saxl pertaining to conjugacy classes in SL_n(q), as well as to the Product Decomposition Conjecture of Liebeck, Nikolov and Shalev.
