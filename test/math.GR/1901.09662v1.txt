Denote by G a finite group and let \psi(G) denote the sum of element orders in G. In 2009, H.Amiri, S.M.Jafarian Amiri and I.M.Isaacs proved that if |G|=n and G is non-cyclic, then \psi(G)<\psi(C_n), where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n. In 2018 we proved that if G is non-cyclic group of order n, then \psi(G)\leq \frac 7{11}\psi(C_n) and equality holds if n=4k with (k,2)=1 and G=(C_2\times C_2)\times C_k. In this paper we proved that equality holds if and only if n and G are as indicated above. Moreover we proved the following generalization of this result: Theorem 4. Let q be a prime and let G be a non-cyclic group of order n, with q being the least prime divisor of n. Then \psi(G)\leq \frac {((q^2-1)q+1)(q+1)}{q^5+1}\psi(C_n), with equality if and only if n=q^2k with (k,q)=1 and G=(C_q\times C_q)\times C_k. Notice that if q=2, then \frac {((q^2-1)q+1)(q+1)}{q^5+1}=\frac 7{11}.
