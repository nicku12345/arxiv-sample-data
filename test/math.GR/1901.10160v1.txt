For an arbitrary group G and arbitrary set A, we define a monoid structure on the set of all uniformly continuous functions A^G\to A and then we show that it is naturally isomorphic to the monoid of cellular automata \mathrm{CA}(G, A). This gives a new equivalent definition of a cellular automaton over the group G with alphabet set A. We use this new interpretation to give a simple proof of the theorem of Curtis-Hedlund.
