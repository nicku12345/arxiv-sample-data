The famous strongly binary Goldbach's conjecture asserts that every even number 2n \geq 8 can always be expressible as the sum of two distinct odd prime numbers. We use a new approach to dealing with this conjecture. Specifically, we apply the element order prime graphs of alternating groups of degrees 2n and 2n-1 to characterize this conjecture, and present its six group-theoretic versions; and further prove that this conjecture is true for p+1 and p-1 whenever p \geq 11 is a prime number.
