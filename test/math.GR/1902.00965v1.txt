We compute the Galois group of the splitting field  F of any irreducible and separable polynomial f(x)=x^6+ax^3+b with a,b\in K, a field with characteristic different from two. The proofs require to distinguish between two cases: whether or not the cubic roots of unity belong to K.   We also give a criterion to determine whether a polynomial as f(x) is irreducible, when F is a finite field. Moreover, at the end of the paper we also give a complete list of all the possible subfields of F.
