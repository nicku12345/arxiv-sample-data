Let F_n be a free group of finite rank n \geq 2. We prove that if H is a subgroup of F_n with \textrm{rk}(H)=2 and R is a retract of F_n, then H \cap R is a retract of H. However, for every m \geq 3 and every 1 \leq k \leq n-1, there exist a subgroup H of F_n of rank m and a retract R of F_n of rank k such that H \cap R is not a retract of H. This gives a complete answer to a question of Bergman.   Furthermore, we provide positive evidence for the inertia conjecture of Dicks and Ventura. More precisely, we prove that \textrm{rk}(H \cap \textrm{Fix}(S)) \leq \textrm{rk}(H) for every family S of endomorphisms of F_n and every subgroup H of F_n with \textrm{rk}(H) \leq 3.
