Let M be a finite dimensional modular representation of a finite group G. We consider the generating function for the non-projective part of the tensor powers of M, and we write \gamma_G(M) for the reciprocal of the radius of convergence of this power series. We investigate the properties of the invariant \gamma_G(M), using tools from representation theory, and from the theory of commutative Banach algebras.
