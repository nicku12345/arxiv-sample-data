The power graph of a group is the graph whose vertex set is the set of nontrivial elements of group, two elements being adjacent if one is a power of the other. We introduce some way for find the automorphism groups of some graphs. As an application We describe the full automorphism group of the power graph of all finite groups. Also we obtain the full automorphism group of power graph of abelian, homocyclic and nilpotent groups
