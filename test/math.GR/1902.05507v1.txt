Several elementary properties of the symmetric group S_n extend in a nice way to the full transformation monoid M_n of all maps of the set X:=\{1,2,3,\dots,n\} into itself. The group S_n turns out to be in some sense the torsion part of the monoid M_n. More precisely, there is a pretorsion theory in the category of all maps f\colon X\to X, X an arbitrary finite non-empty set, in which bijections are exactly the torsion objects.
