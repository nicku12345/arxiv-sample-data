In 1951, Higman constructed a remarkable group H=\left\langle a,b,c,d \, \left| \, b^a = b^2, c^b = c^2, d^c = d^2, a^d = a^2 \right. \right\rangle and used it to produce the first examples of infinite simple groups. By studying fixed points of certain finite state transducers, we show the conjugacy problem in H is decidable (for all inputs). Diekert, Laun and Ushakov have recently shown the word problem in H is solvable in polynomial time, using the power circuit technology of Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won. Building on this work, we show in a strongly generic setting that the conjugacy problem has a O(n^7) polynomial time solution.
