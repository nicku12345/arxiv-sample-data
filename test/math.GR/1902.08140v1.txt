We introduce a new kind of action of a relatively hyperbolic group on a CAT(0) cube complex, called a relatively geometric action. We provide an application to characterize finite-volume Kleinian groups in terms of action on cube complexes, analogous to the results of Markovic and Ha\"issinsky in the closed case.
