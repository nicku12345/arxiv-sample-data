Let q be a prime and A an elementary abelian q-group acting as a coprime group of automorphisms on a profinite group G. We show that if A is of order q^2 and some power of each element in C_G(a) is Engel in G for any a\in A^{\#}, then G is locally virtually nilpotent. Assuming that A is of order q^3 we prove that if some power of each element in C_G(a) is Engel in C_G(a) for any a\in A^{\#}, then G is locally virtually nilpotent. Some analogues consequences of quantitative nature for finite groups are also obtained.
