We adapt the commutator theory of universal algebra to the particular setting of racks and quandles, exploiting a Galois connection between congruences and certain normal subgroups of the displacement group. Congruence properties such as abelianness and centrality are reflected by the corresponding relative displacement groups, and so do the global properties, solvability and nilpotence. To show the new tool in action, we present three applications: non-existence theorems for quandles (no connected involutory quandles of order 2^k, no latin quandles of order \equiv2\pmod4), a non-colorability theorem (knots with trivial Alexander polynomial are not colorable by latin quandles), and a strengthening of Glauberman's results on Bruck loops of odd order.
