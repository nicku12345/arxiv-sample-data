To follow up on the results of [1], we propose a computationally efficient explicit cyclic decomposition of the maximal tori in the groups SL_n(q) and SU_n(q) and their projective images. We also derive some corollaries to simplify practical calculation of the maximal tori. The result is based on a generic cyclic decomposition of a finite abelian group which might also be of interest.
