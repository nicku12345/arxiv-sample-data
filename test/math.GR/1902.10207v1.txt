Let G be a Garside group endowed with the generating set \mathcal{S} of non-trivial simple elements, and let H be a parabolic subgroup of G. We determine a transversal T of H in G such that each \theta \in T is of minimal length in its right-coset, H \theta, for the word length with respect to \mathcal{S}. We show that there exists a regular language L on \mathcal{S} \cup \mathcal{S}^{-1} and a bijection \mathrm{ev} : L \to T satisfying \mathrm{lg} (U) = \mathrm{lg}_\mathcal{S}( \mathrm{ev}(U)) for all U \in L. From this we deduce that the coset growth series of H in G is rational. Finally, we show that G has fellow projections on H but does not have bounded projections on H.
