Let G,D_{0},D_{1} be finite groups such that D_{0}\trianglelefteq D_{1} are groups of automorphisms of G that contain the inner automorphisms of G. Assume that D_{1}/D_{0} has a normal 2-complement and that D_{1} acts fixed-point-freely on the set of D_{0}-conjugacy classes of involutions of G (i.e., C_{D_{1}}(a)D_{0}<D_{1} for every involution a\in G). We prove that G is solvable. We also construct a nonsolvable finite group that possesses no characteristic conjugacy class of nontrivial cyclic subgroups. This shows that an assumption on the structure of D_{1}/D_{0} above must be made in order to guarantee the solvability of G and also yields a negative answer to Problem 3.51 in the Kourovka Notebook, posed by A. I. Saksonov in 1969.
