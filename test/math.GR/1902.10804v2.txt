We show that if \mathsf V is a semigroup pseudovariety containing the finite semilattices and contained in \mathsf {DS}, then it has a basis of pseudoidentities between finite products of regular pseudowords if, and only if, the corresponding variety of languages is closed under bideterministic product. The key to this equivalence is a weak generalization of the existence and uniqueness of \mathsf J-reduced factorizations. This equational approach is used to address the locality of some pseudovarieties. In particular, it is shown that \mathsf {DH}\cap\mathsf {ECom} is local, for any group pseudovariety \mathsf H.
