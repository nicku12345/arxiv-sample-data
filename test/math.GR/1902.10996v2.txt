We study the speed of convergence to the asymptotic cone for Cayley graphs of nilpotent groups. Burago showed that \{(\mathbb{Z}^d, \frac{1}{n} \rho,id)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} converges to (\mathbb{R}^d,d_{\infty},id) and its speed is O(\frac{1}{n}) in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Later Breuillard and Le Donne gave estimates for non-abelian cases, and constructed an example whose speed of convergence is slower than O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}). For 2-step nilpotent groups, we show that if the Mal'cev completion is non-singular, then the speed of convergence is O(\frac{1}{n}) for any choice of generating set. In terms of subFinsler geometry, this condition is also equivalent to the absence of abnormal geodesics on the asymptotic cone.
