The aim of this work is to construct families of weighing matrices via their automorphism group action. This action is determined from the 0,1,2-cohomology groups of the underlying abstract group. As a consequence, some old and new families of weighing matrices are constructed. These include the Paley Conference, the Projective-Space, the Grassmannian, and the Flag-Variety weighing matrices. We develop a general theory relying on low dimensional group-cohomology for constructing automorphism group actions, and in turn obtain structured matrices that we call \emph{Cohomology-Developed matrices}. This "Cohomology-Development" generalizes the Cocyclic and Group Developments. The Algebraic structure of modules of Cohomology-Developed matrices is discussed, and an orthogonality result is deduced. We also use this algebraic structure to define the notion of \emph{Quasiproducts}, which is a generalization of the Kronecker-product.
