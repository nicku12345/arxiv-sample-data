The minimal base size b(G) for a permutation group G, is a widely studied topic in the permutation group theory. Z. Halasi and K. Podoski proved that b(G)\leq 2 for coprime linear groups. Motivated by this result and the probabilistic method used by T. C. Burness, M. W. Liebeck and A. Shalev, it was asked by L. Pyber that for coprime linear groups G\leq GL(V), whether there exists a constant c such that the probability of that a random c-tuple is a base for G tends to 1 as |V|\to\infty. While the answer to this question is negative in general, it is positive under the additional assumption that G is even primitive as a linear group. In this paper, we show that almost all 11-tuples are bases for coprime primitive linear groups.
