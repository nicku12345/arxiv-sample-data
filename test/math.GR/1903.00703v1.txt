We study the relation between the alternating product of twisted Poincar'e series of parabolic subgroups of affine Weyl groups and hyperbolic stabilizers of geodesic tubes. Moreover, from such relation, we find a length-preserving factorization of affine Weyl groups of type \tilde{A}_n and \tilde{C}_n.
