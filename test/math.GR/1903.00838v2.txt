Let m and k be integers such that |m|, \, |k| >1 and \gcd (m,k)=1. We show that all Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,mk) are non-residually finite groups hyperbolic relative to residually finite subgroups. By a result of Osin (2007), this implies that there exists a non-residually finite hyperbolic group, thus solving a long-standing open problem of Gromov (1987). We also show that all BS(m, mk) are non-Hopfian groups hyperbolic relative to Hopfian subgroups.
