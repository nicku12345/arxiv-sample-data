Let q be a prime and A a finite q-group of exponent q acting by automorphisms on a finite q'-group G. Assume that A has order at least q^3. We show that if \gamma_{\infty} (C_{G}(a)) has order at most m for any a \in A^{\#}, then the order of \gamma_{\infty} (G) is bounded solely in terms of m. If the Fitting subgroup of C_{G}(a) has index at most m for any a \in A^{\#}, then the second Fitting subgroup of G has index bounded solely in terms of m.
