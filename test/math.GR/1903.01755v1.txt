Let G be a finite non-solvable group with solvable radical Sol(G). The solvable graph \Gamma_s(G) of G is a graph with vertex set G\setminus Sol(G) and two distinct vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if \langle u, v \rangle is solvable. We show that \Gamma_s (G) is not a star graph, a tree, an n-partite graph for any positive integer n \geq 2 and not a regular graph for any non-solvable finite group G. We compute the girth of \Gamma_s (G) and derive a lower bound of the clique number of \Gamma_s (G). We prove the non-existence of finite non-solvable groups whose solvable graphs are planar, toroidal, double-toroidal, triple-toroidal or projective. We conclude the paper by obtaining a relation between \Gamma_s (G) and the solvability degree of G.
