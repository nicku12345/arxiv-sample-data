Let G be a finite group of odd order admitting an involutory automorphism \phi. We obtain two results bounding the exponent of [G,\phi]. Denote by G_{-\phi} the set \{[g,\phi]\,\vert\, g\in G\} and by G_{\phi} the centralizer of \phi, that is, the subgroup of fixed points of \phi. The obtained results are as follows.1. Assume that the subgroup \langle x,y\rangle has derived length at most d and x^e=1 for every x,y\in G_{-\phi}. Suppose that G_\phi is nilpotent of class c. Then the exponent of [G,\phi] is (c,d,e)-bounded.2. Assume that G_\phi has rank r and x^e=1 for each x\in G_{-\phi}. Then the exponent of [G,\phi] is (e,r)-bounded.
