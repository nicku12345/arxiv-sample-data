In a group G, a weak Sierpi\'nski subset is a subset E such that for some g,h\in G and a\neq b\in E, we have gE=E\smallsetminus \{a\} and hE=E\smallsetminus \{b\}. In this setting, we study the subgroup generated by g and h, and show that it has a special presentation, namely of the form G_k=\langle g,h\mid (h^{-1}g)^k\rangle unless it is free over (g,h). In addition, in such groups G_k, we characterize all weak Sierpi\'nski subsets.
