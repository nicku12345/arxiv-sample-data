We call an element of a finite general linear group  \textrm{GL}(d,q)  \emph{fat} if it leaves invariant, and acts irreducibly on, a subspace of dimension greater than d/2. Fatness of an element can be decided efficiently in practice by testing whether its characteristic polynomial has an irreducible factor of degree greater than d/2. We show that for groups G with  \textrm{SL}(d,q) \leq G \leq \textrm{GL}(d,q)  most pairs of fat elements from G generate irreducible subgroups, namely we prove that the proportion of pairs of fat elements generating a reducible subgroup, in the set of all pairs in  G \times G , is less than q^{-d+1}. We also prove that the conditional probability to obtain a pair (g_1,g_2) in G \times G which generates a reducible subgroup, given that g_1, g_2 are fat elements, is less than 2q^{-d+1}. Further, we show that any reducible subgroup generated by a pair of fat elements acts irreducibly on a subspace of dimension greater than  d/2 , and in the induced action the generating pair corresponds to a pair of fat elements.
