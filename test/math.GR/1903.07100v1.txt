This paper enriches the list of known properties of congruence sequences starting from the universal relation and successively performing the operators lower k and lower t. Two series of inverse semigroups, namely \ker{\alpha_n}-is-Clifford semigroups and \beta_n-is-over-E-unitary semigroups, are investigated. Two congruences, namely \alpha_{n+2} and \beta_{n+2}, are found to be the least \ker{\alpha_n}-is-Clifford and least \beta_n-is-over-E-unitary congruences on S, respectively. A new system of implications is established for the quasivarieties of inverse semigroups induced by the min network.
