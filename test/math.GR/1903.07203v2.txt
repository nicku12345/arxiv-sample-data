If f : \tilde{\Gamma} \rightarrow \Gamma is a covering map between connected graphs, and H is the subgroup of \pi_1(\Gamma,v) used to construct the cover, then it is well known that the group of deck transformations of the cover is isomorphic to  N(H)/H, where N(H) is the normalizer of H in \pi_1(\Gamma,v). We show that an entirely analogous result holds for immersions between connected graphs, where the subgroup H is replaced by the closed inverse submonoid of the inverse monoid L(\Gamma,v) used to construct the immersion. We observe a relationship between group actions on graphs and deck transformations of graph immersions. We also show that a graph immersion f : \tilde{\Gamma} \rightarrow \Gamma may be extended to a cover g : \tilde{\Delta} \rightarrow \Gamma in such a way that all deck transformations of f are restrictions of deck transformations of g.
