Let p be an odd prime and let J_o(X), J_r(X) and J_e(X) denote the three different versions of Thompson subgroups for a p-group X. In this article, we first prove an extension of Glauberman's replacement theorem. Secondly, we prove the following: Let G be a p-stable group and P\in Syl_p(G). Suppose that C_G(O_{p}(G))\leq O_{p}(G). If D is a strongly closed subgroup in P, then Z(J_o(D)), \Omega(Z(J_r(D))) and \Omega(Z(J_e(D))) are normal subgroups of G. Thirdly, we show the following: Let G be a \text{Qd}(p)-free group and P\in Syl_p(G). If D is a strongly closed subgroup in P, then the normalizers of the subgroups Z(J_o(D)), \Omega(Z(J_r(D))) and \Omega(Z(J_e(D))) control strong G-fusion in P. We also prove a similar result for a p-stable and p-constrained group. Lastly, we give a p-nilpotency criteria, which is an extension of Glauberman-Thompson p-nilpotency theorem.
