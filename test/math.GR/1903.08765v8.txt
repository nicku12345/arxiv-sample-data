The size of minimal generating set for commutator of Sylow 2-subgroup of alternating group was found. Given a permutational wreath product of finite cyclic groups sequence we prove that the commutator width of such groups is 1 and we research some properties of its commutator subgroup. It was shown that (Syl_2 A_{2^k})^2 = Syl'_2 (A_{2^k}), \, k>2.   A new approach to presentation of Sylow 2-subgroups of alternating group {A_{{2^{k}}}} was applied. As a result the short proof that the commutator width of Sylow 2-subgroups of alternating group {A_{{2^{k}}}}, permutation group {S_{{2^{k}}}} and Sylow p-subgroups of Syl_2 A_{p^k} (Syl_2 S_{p^k}) are equal to 1 was obtained. Commutator width of permutational wreath product B \wr C_n were investigated. It was proven that the commutator length of an arbitrary element of commutator of the wreath product of cyclic groups C_{p_i}, \, p_i\in \mathbb{N}  equals to 1. The commutator width of direct limit of wreath product of cyclic groups are found. As a corollary, it was shown that the commutator width of Sylows p-subgroups Syl_2(S_{{p^{k}}}) of symmetric S_{{p^{k}}} and alternating groups A_{{p^{k}}} p \geq 2 are also equal to 1. A recursive presentation of Sylows 2-subgroups Syl_2(A_{{2^{k}}}) of A_{{2^{k}}} was introduced. The structure of Sylows 2-subgroups commutator of symmetric and alternating groups were investigated. For an arbitrary group B an upper bound of commutator width of C_p \wr B was founded.
