In this article we study the involutions of \mathrm{O}(V,\mathrm{q}), an orthogonal group for a vector space V with quadratic form \mathrm{q} over a field of characteristic 2. The classification proceeds by discussing conjugacy classes of involutions arising as a product of transvections, involutions with respect to a hyperbolic space, and involutions acting nontrivially in the radical of V. We achieve a complete classification of the conjugacy classes of involutions when the quadratic space (V,\mathrm{q}) is non-defective, and conclude with a discussion of the defective case.
