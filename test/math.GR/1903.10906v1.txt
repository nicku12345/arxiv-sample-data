Let H be an acylindrically hyperbolic group without nontrivial finite normal subgroups. We show that any finite system S of equations with constants from H is equivalent to a single equation. We also show that the algebraic set associated with S is, up to conjugacy, a projection of the algebraic set associated with a single splitted equation (such equation has the form w(x_1,\dots,x_n)=h, where w\in F(X), h\in H). From this we deduce the following statement: Let G be an arbitrary overgroup of the above group H. Then H is verbally closed in G if and only if it is algebraically closed in G. Another corollary: If H is a non-cyclic torsion-free hyperbolic group, then every (possibly infinite) system of equations with finitely many variables and with constants from H is equivalent to a single equation.
