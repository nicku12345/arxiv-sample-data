Let a group G act properly discontinuously and cocompactly on a locally compact space X. A Hausdorff compact space Z that contains X as an open subspace has the perspectivity property if the action G\curvearrowright X extends to an action G\curvearrowright Z, by homeomorphisms, such that for every compact K\subseteq X and every element u of the unique uniform structure compatible with the topology of Z, the set \{gK: g \in G\} has finitely many non u-small sets. We describe a correspondence between the compact spaces with the perspectivity property with respect to X (and the fixed action of G on it) and the compact spaces with the perspectivity property with respect to G (and the left multiplication on itself). This generalizes a similar result for convergence group actions.
