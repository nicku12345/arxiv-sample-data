It is well known that the proportion of pairs of elements of \operatorname{SL}(n,q) which generate the group tends to 1 as q^n\to \infty. This was proved by Kantor and Lubotzky using the classification of finite simple groups. We give a proof of this theorem which does not depend on the classification.   An essential step in our proof is an estimate for the average of 1/\operatorname{ord} g when g ranges over \operatorname{GL}(n,q), which may be of independent interest. We prove that this average is \[   \exp(-(2-o(1)) \sqrt{n \log n \log q}). \]
