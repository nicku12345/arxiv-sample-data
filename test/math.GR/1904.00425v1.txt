Let G be a finite group and \psi(G)=\sum_{g\in{G}}{o(g)}. There are some results about the relation between \psi(G) and the structure of G. For instance, it is proved that if G is a group of order n and \psi(G)>\dfrac{211}{1617}\psi(C_n), then G is solvable. Herzog {\it{et al.}} in [Herzog {\it{et al.}}, Two new criteria for solvability of finite groups, J. Algebra, 2018] put forward the following conjecture:   \noindent{\bf Conjecture.} {\it {If G is a non-solvable group of order n, then {\psi(G)}\,{\leq}\,{{\dfrac{211}{1617}}{\psi(C_n)}} with equality if and only if G=A_5. In particular, this inequality holds for all non-abelian simple groups.} }   In this paper, we prove a modified version of Herzog's Conjecture.
