We define a Howe-Moore property relative to a set of subgroups. Namely, a group G has the Howe-Moore property relative to a set \mathcal{F} of subgroups if for every unitary representation \pi of G, whenever the restriction of \pi to any element of \mathcal{F} has no non-trivial invariant vectors, the matrix coefficients vanish at infinity. We prove that a semisimple group has the Howe-Moore property relatively to the family of its factors.
