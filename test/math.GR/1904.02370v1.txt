We study the impact of certain identities and probabilistic identities on the structure of finite groups. More specifically, let w be a nontrivial word in d distinct variables and let G be a finite group for which the word map w_G:G^d\rightarrow G has a fiber of size at least \rho|G|^d for some fixed \rho>0. We show that, for certain words w, this implies that G has a normal solvable subgroup of index bounded above in terms of w and \rho. We also show that, for a larger family of words w, this implies that the nonsolvable length of G is bounded above in terms of w and \rho, thus providing evidence in favor of a conjecture of Larsen. Along the way we obtain results of some independent interest, showing roughly that most elements of large finite permutation groups have large support.
