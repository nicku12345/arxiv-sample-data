Let G=\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2 and H=\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}). We prove that the action G\curvearrowright\mathbb{R}^2 is uniformly non-amenable and that the quasi-regular representation of G on \ell^2(G/H) has a uniform spectral gap. Both results are a consequence of a uniform quantitative form of ping-pong for affine transformations, which we establish here.
