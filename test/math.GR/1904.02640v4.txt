In this paper we extend the approach of M. Cavaleri to effective amenability to the class of computably enumerable groups, i.e. in particular we do not assume that groups are finitely generated. In the case of computable groups we also study complexity of the set of all effective F{\o}lner sequences and effective paradoxical decomposition. The paper is extended by an appendix written by Aleksander Ivanov, which contains a solution of a problem from the previous version.
