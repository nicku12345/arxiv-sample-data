We construct a general cohomological induction isomorphism from a uniform measure equivalence of locally compact, second countable, unimodular groups which, as a special case, yields that the graded cohomology rings of quasi-isometric, connected, simply connected, nilpotent Lie groups are isomorphic. This unifies results of Shalom and Sauer and also provides new insight into the quasi-isometry classification problem for low dimensional nilpotent Lie groups.
