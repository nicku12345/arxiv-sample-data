A finite group of order n is said to have the distinct divisor property (DDP) if there exists a permutation g_1,\ldots, g_n of its elements such that g_i^{-1}g_{i+1} \neq g_j^{-1}g_{j+1} for all 1\leq i<j<n. We show that an abelian group is DDP if and only if it has a unique element of order 2. We also describe a construction of DDP groups via group extensions by abelian groups and show that there exist infinitely many non abelian DDP groups.
