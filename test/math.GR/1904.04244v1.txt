In this paper one construction of composition formations was introduced. This construction contains formations of quasinilpotent groups, c-supersoluble groups, groups defined by ranks of chief factors and some new classes of groups. A partial answer on a question of L.\,A. Shemetkov about the intersection of \mathfrak{F}-maximal subgroups and the \mathfrak{F}-hypercenter was given for these composition formations.
