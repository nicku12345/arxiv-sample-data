In this paper we extend the notion of CP covers for groups to the field of Lie algebras, and show that despite the case of groups, all CP covers of a Lie algebra are isomorphic. Finally we show that CP covers of groups and Lie rings which are in Lazard correspondence, are in Lazard correspondence too, and the Bogomolov multipliers are isomorphic.
