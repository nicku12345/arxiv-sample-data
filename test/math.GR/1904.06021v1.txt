We introduce the notion of finite stature of a family \{H_i\} of subgroups of a group G. We investigate the separability of subgroups of a group G that splits as a graph of hyperbolic special groups with quasiconvex edge groups. We prove that when the vertex groups of G have finite stature, then quasiconvex subgroups of the vertex groups of G are separable in G. We present some partial results in a relatively hyperbolic framework.
