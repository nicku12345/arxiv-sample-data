The semigroup \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty} of all partial co-finite isometries of positive integers is studied. We describe Green's relations on the semigroup \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty}, its band and proved that \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty} is a simple E-unitary F-inverse semigroup. We described the least group congruence \mathfrak{C}_{\mathbf{mg}} on \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty} and proved that the quotient-semigroup \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty}/\mathfrak{C}_{\mathbf{mg}} is isomorphic to the additive group of integers. An example of a non-group congruence on the semigroup \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty} is presented. Also we proved that a congruence on the semigroup \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty} is a group congruence if and only if its restriction onto an isomorphic copy of the bicyclic semigroup in \mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_{\infty} is a group congruence.
