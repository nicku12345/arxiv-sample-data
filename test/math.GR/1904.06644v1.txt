We study the semigroup \textbf{{ID}}_{\infty} of all partial isometries of the set of integers \mathbb{Z}. It is proved that the quotient semigroup \textbf{{ID}}_{\infty}/\mathfrak{C}_{\textsf{mg}}, where \mathfrak{C}_{\textsf{mg}} is the minimum group congruence, is isomorphic to the group {\textsf{Iso}}(\mathbb{Z}) of all isometries of \mathbb{Z}, \textbf{{ID}}_{\infty} is an F-inverse semigroup, and \textbf{{ID}}_{\infty} is isomorphic to the semidirect product {\textsf{Iso}}(\mathbb{Z})\ltimes_\mathfrak{h}\mathscr{P}_{\!\infty}(\mathbb{Z}) of the free semilattice with unit (\mathscr{P}_{\!\infty}(\mathbb{Z}),\cup) by the group {\textsf{Iso}}(\mathbb{Z}). We give the sufficient conditions on a shift-continuous topology \tau on \textbf{{ID}}_{\infty} when \tau is discrete. A non-discrete Hausdorff semigroup topology on \textbf{{ID}}_{\infty} is constructed. Also, the problem of an embedding of the discrete semigroup \textbf{{ID}}_{\infty} into Hausdorff compact-like topological semigroups is studied.
