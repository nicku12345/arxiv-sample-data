In the paper we investigate the semigroup of monotone co-finite partial homeomorphisms of the space of the usual real line \mathbb{R}. We prove that the inverse semigroup \mathscr{P\!\!H}^+_{\!\!\operatorname{\textsf{cf}}}\!(\mathbb{R}) is factorizable and F-inverse. We describe the structure of the band of the semigroup \mathscr{P\!\!H}^+_{\!\!\operatorname{\textsf{cf}}}\!(\mathbb{R}), its two-sided ideals, maximal subgroups and Green's relations. We prove that the quotient semigroup \mathscr{P\!\!H}^+_{\!\!\operatorname{\textsf{cf}}}\!(\mathbb{R})/\mathfrak{C}_{\textsf{mg}}, where \mathfrak{C}_{\textsf{mg}} is the maximum group congruence on \mathscr{P\!\!H}^+_{\!\!\operatorname{\textsf{cf}}}\!(\mathbb{R})/\mathfrak{C}_{\textsf{mg}}, is isomorphic to the group of all oriental homeomorphisms of the space \mathbb{R}, and showe that the semigroup \mathscr{P\!\!H}^+_{\!\!\operatorname{\textsf{cf}}}\!(\mathbb{R}) is isomorphic to a semidirect product \mathscr{H}^+\!(\mathbb{R})\ltimes_\mathfrak{h}\mathscr{P}_{\!\infty}(\mathbb{R}) of the free semilattice with unit (\mathscr{P}_{\!\infty}(\mathbb{R}),\cup) by the group \mathscr{H}^+\!(\mathbb{R}).
