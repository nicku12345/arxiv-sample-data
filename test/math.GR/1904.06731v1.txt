Let \mathfrak{F} be a class of finite groups and G a finite group. Let {\cal L}_{\mathfrak{F}}(G) be the set of all subgroups A of G with A^{G}/A_{G}\in \mathfrak{F}. A chief factor H/K of G is \mathfrak{F}-central in G if (H/K)\rtimes (G/C_{G}(H/K)) \in\mathfrak{F}.   We study the structure of G under the hypothesis that every chief factor   of G between A_{G} and A^{G} is \mathfrak{F}-central in G for every subgroup A\in {\cal L}_{\mathfrak{F}}(G). As an application, we prove that a finite soluble group G is a PST-group if and only if A^{G}/A_{G}\leq Z_{\infty}(G/A_{G}) for every subgroup A\in {\cal L}_{\mathfrak{N}}(G), where \mathfrak{N} is the class of all nilpotent groups.
