Let \pi be a set of primes and \mathfrak{F} be a formation. In this article a properties of the class {\rm w}^{*}_{\pi}\mathfrak{F} of all groups G, such that \pi(G)\subseteq \pi(\mathfrak{F}) and the normalizers of all Sylow p-subgroups of G are \mathfrak{F}-subnormal in G for every p\in\pi\cap\pi(G) are investigated. It is established that {\rm w}^{*}_{\pi}\mathfrak{F} is a formation. Some hereditary saturated formations \mathfrak{F} for which {\rm w}^{*}_{\pi}\mathfrak{F}=\mathfrak{F} are founded.
