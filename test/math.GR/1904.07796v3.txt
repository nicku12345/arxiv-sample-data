We prove the Tits Alternative for groups with a bound on the order of finite subgroups, acting properly on 2-dimensional "recurrent" complexes. This class of complexes includes, among others: 2-dimensional buildings, 2-dimensional systolic complexes, B(6)-small cancellation complexes, and standard Cayley complexes for Artin groups of extra-large type. In the appendix written jointly with Jon McCammond we extend the result to a class of 2-dimensional Artin groups containing all large-type Artin groups.
