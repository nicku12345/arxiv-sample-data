A character of a group is said to be super-monomial if every primitive character inducing it is linear. It is conjectured by Isaacs that every irreducible character of an odd M-group is super-monomial. We show that all non linear irreducible characters of lowest degree of an odd M-group is super-monomial and provide cases in which one can guarantee that certain irreducible characters of normal subgroups are super-monomial. Finally, we study groups having two irreducible monomial character degrees.
