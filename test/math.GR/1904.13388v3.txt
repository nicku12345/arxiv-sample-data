In the paper we describe the class of principal quandles and show that connected quandles can be decomposed as a disjoint union of principal quandles. We also prove that simple affine quandles are finite and they can be characterized among finite simple quandles by several different equivalent properties, as for instance being doubly homogeneous (i.e. having a doubly transitive automorphism group). A complete description of finite doubly-homogeneous quandles is provided extending the result of \cite{V} and solving \cite[Problem 6.7]{2trans}. We also provide a classification of connected cyclic quandles with several fixed points independently from \cite{CQ}.
