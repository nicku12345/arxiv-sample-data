If G is a group acting geometrically on a CAT(0) cube complex X and if g \in G is an infinite-order element, we show that exactly one of the following situations occurs: (i) g defines a rank-one isometry of X; (ii) the stable centraliser SC_G(g)= \{ h \in G \mid \exists n \geq 1, [h,g^n]=1 \} of g is not virtually cyclic; (iii) \mathrm{Fix}_Y(g^n) is finite for every n \geq 1 and the sequence (\mathrm{Fix}_Y(g^n)) takes infinitely many values, where Y is a cubical component of the Roller boundary of X which contains an endpoint of an axis of g. We also show that (iii) cannot occur in several cases, providing a purely algebraic characterisation of rank-one isometries.
