In this article, we state and prove a general criterion which prevents some groups from acting properly on finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes. As an application, we show that, for every non-trivial finite group F, the lamplighter group F \wr \mathbb{F}_2 over a free group does not act properly on a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex (although it acts properly on a infinite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex). We also deduce from this general criterion that, roughly speaking, given a group G acting on a CAT(0) cube complex of finite dimension and an infinite torsion subgroup L \leq G, either the normaliser N_G(L) is close to be free abelian or, for every k \geq 1, N_G(L) contains a non-abelian free subgroup commuting with a subgroup of L of size \geq k.
