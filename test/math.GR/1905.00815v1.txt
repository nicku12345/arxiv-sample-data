Let G be a finite group and \psi(G) = \sum_{g \in G} o(g), where o(g) denotes the order of g \in G. First, we prove that if G is a group of order n and \psi(G) >31\psi(C_n)/77, where C_n is the cyclic group of order n, then G is supersolvable. This proves a conjecture of M.~{T\u{a}rn\u{a}uceanu}. Moreover, M. Herzog, P. Longobardi and M. Maj put forward the following conjecture: If H\leq G, then \psi(G) \leqslant \psi(H) |G:H|^2. In the sequel, by an example we show that this conjecture is not satisfied in general.
