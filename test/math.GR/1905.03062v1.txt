A subgroup H\leq G is said to be almost normal if every conjugate of H is commensurable to H. If H is almost normal, there is a well-defined quotient space G/H. We show that if a group G has type F_{n+1} and contains an almost normal coarse PD_n subgroup H with e(G/H)=\infty, then whenever G' is quasi-isometric to G, it contains an almost normal subgroup H' that is quasi-isometric to H. Moreover, the quotient spaces G/H and G'/H' are quasi-isometric. This generalises a theorem of Mosher-Sageev-Whyte, who prove the case in which G/H is quasi-isometric to a finite valence bushy tree. Using work of Mosher, we generalise a result of Farb-Mosher to show that for many surface group extensions \Gamma_L, any group quasi-isometric to \Gamma_L is virtually isomorphic to \Gamma_L. We also prove quasi-isometric rigidity for the class of finitely presented \mathbb{Z}-by-(\infty ended) groups.
