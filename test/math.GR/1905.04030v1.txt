The purpose of this paper is to study the generalization of inverse semigroups (without order). An ordered semigroup S is called an inverse ordered semigroup if for every a 2 S, any two inverses of a are H-related. We prove that an ordered semigroup is complete semilattice of t-simple ordered semigroups if and only if it is completely regular and inverse. Furthermore characterizations of inverse ordered semigroups have been characterized by their ordered idempotents.
