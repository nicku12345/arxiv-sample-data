For an element g of a group G, an Engel sink is a subset \mathcal{E}(g) such that for every  x\in G  all sufficiently long commutators  [x,g,g,\ldots,g]  belong to \mathcal{E}(g). We conjecture that if G is a profinite group in which every element admits a sink that is a procyclic subgroup, then G is procyclic-by-(locally nilpotent). We prove the conjecture in two cases -- when G is a finite group, or a soluble pro-p group.
