To any finite graph X (viewed as a topological space) we assosiate some explicit compact metric space {\cal X}^r(X) which we call {\it the reflection tree of graphs X}. This space is of topological dimension \le1 and its connected components are locally connected. We show that if X is appropriately triangulated (as a simplicial graph \Gamma for which X is the geometric realization) then the visual boundary \partial_\infty(W,S) of the right angled Coxeter system (W,S) with the nerve isomorphic to \Gamma is homeomorphic to {\cal X}^r(X). For each X, this yields in particular many word hyperbolic groups with Gromov boundary homeomorphic to the space {\cal X}^r(X).
