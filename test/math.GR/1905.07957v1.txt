Let G be a finite group. We consider the problem of counting simultaneous conjugacy classes of n-tuples and and simultaneous conjugacy classes of commuting n-tuples in G. Let \alpha_{G,n} denote the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes of n-tuples, and \beta_{G,n} the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes of commuting n-tuples in G. The generating functions A_G(t) = \sum_{n\geq 0} \alpha_{G,n}t^n, and B_G(t) = \sum_{n\geq 0} \beta_{G,n}t^n are rational functions of t. We show that A_G(t) determines and is completely determined by the class equation of G. We show that \alpha_{G,n} grows exponentially with growth factor equal to the cardinality of G, whereas \beta_{G,n} grows exponentially with growth factor equal to the maximum cardinality of an abelian subgroup of G. The functions A_G(t) and B_G(t) may be regarded as combinatorial invariants of the finite group G. We study dependencies amongst these invariants and the notion of isoclinism for finite groups. Indeed, we prove that the normalized functions A_G(t/|G|) and B_G(t/|G|) are invariants of isoclinism families. We compute these normalized functions A_G(t/|G|) and B_G(t/|G|) for certain finite p-groups including all isoclinism families of rank at most 5.
