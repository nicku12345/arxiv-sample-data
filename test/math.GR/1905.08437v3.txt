A variety of universal algebras is called limit if it is non-finitely based but all its proper subvarieties are finitely based. Until recently, only two explicit examples of limit varieties of monoids, constructed by Jackson, were known. Recently Zhang and Luo found the third example of such a variety. In our work, one more example of a limit variety of monoids is given.
