Every F-inverse monoid can be equipped with the unary operation which maps each element to the maximum element of its \sigma-class. In this enriched signature, the class of all F-inverse monoids forms a variety of algebraic structures. We describe universal objects in several classes of F-inverse monoids, in particular free F-inverse monoids. More precisely, for every X-generated group G we describe the initial object in the category of all X-generated F-inverse monoids F for which F/\sigma=G.
