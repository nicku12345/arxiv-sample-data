In the paper the notion of a star partial homeomorphism of a finite dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^n is introduced. We describe the structure of the semigroup \mathbf{PStH}_{\mathbb{R}^n} of star partial homeomorphisms of the space \mathbb{R}^n. The structure of the band of \mathbf{PStH}_{\mathbb{R}^n} and Green's relations on \mathbf{PStH}_{\mathbb{R}^n} are described. We show that \mathbf{PStH}_{\mathbb{R}^n} is a bisimple inverse semigroup and every non-unit congruence on \mathbf{PStH}_{\mathbb{R}^n} is a group congruence.
