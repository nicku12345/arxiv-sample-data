Denote by G a finite group and by \psi(G) the sum of element orders in G. If t is a positive integer, denote by C_t the cyclic group of order t and write \psi(t)=\psi(C_t). In this paper we proved the following Theorem A: Let G be a non-cyclic group of odd order n=qm, where q is the smallest prime divisor of n and (m,q)=1. Then the following statements hold. (1) If q=3, then \frac {\psi(G)}{\psi(|G|)}\leq \frac {85}{301}, and equality holds if and only if n=3\cdot 7\cdot m_1 with (m_1,42)=1 and G=(C_7\rtimes C_3)\times C_{m_1}, with C_7\rtimes C_3 non-abelian. (2) If q>3, then \frac {\psi(G)}{\psi(|G|)}\leq \frac {p^4+p^3-p^2+1}{p^5+1}, where p is the smallest prime bigger than q and equality holds if and only if n=qp^2m_1 with (m_1,p!)=1 and G=C_q\times C_p\times C_p \times C_{m_1}.
