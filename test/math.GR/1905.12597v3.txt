A \vee-complement of a subgroup H \leqslant \mathbb{F}_n is a subgroup K \leqslant \mathbb{F}_n such that H \vee K = \mathbb{F}_n. If we also ask K to have trivial intersection with H, then we say that K is a \oplus-complement of H. The minimum possible rank of a \vee-complement (resp. \oplus-complement) of H is called the \vee-corank (resp. \oplus-corank) of H. We use Stallings automata to study these notions and the relations between them. In particular, we characterize when complements exist, compute the \vee-corank, and provide language-theoretical descriptions of the sets of cyclic complements. Finally, we prove that the two notions of corank coincide on subgroups that admit cyclic complements of both kinds.
