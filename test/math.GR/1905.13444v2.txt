We determine the fundamental groups of symmetrizable algebraically simply connected split real Kac-Moody groups endowed with the Kac-Peterson topology. In analogy to the finite-dimensional situation, the Iwasawa decomposition G = KAU_+ provides a weak homotopy equivalence K \hookrightarrow G, implying \pi_1(G) = \pi_1(K). It thus suffices to determine \pi_1(K) which we achieve by investigating the fundamental groups of generalized flag varieties. Our results apply in all cases in which the Bruhat decomposition of the generalized flag variety is a CW decomposition - in particular, we cover the complete symmetrizable situation; the result concerning the structure of \pi_1(K) more generally also holds in the non-symmetrizable two-spherical situation.
