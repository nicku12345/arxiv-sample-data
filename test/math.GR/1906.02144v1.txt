The classical result by Dyer--Scott about fixed subgroups of finite order automorphisms of F_n being free factors of F_n is no longer true in Z^m\times F_n. Within this more general context, we prove a relaxed version in the spirit of Bestvina--Handel Theorem: the rank of fixed subgroups of finite order automorphisms is uniformly bounded in terms of m,n. We also study periodic points of endomorphisms of Z^m\times F_n, and give an algorithm to compute auto-fixed closures of finitely generated subgroups of Z^m\times F_n. On the way, we prove the analog of Day's Theorem for real elements in Z^m\times F_n, contributing a modest step into the project of doing so for any right angled Artin group (as McCool did with respect to Whitehead's Theorem in the free context).
