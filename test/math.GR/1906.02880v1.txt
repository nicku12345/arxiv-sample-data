We give a complete classification of all nonuniform congruences on orthogonal rook monoids and symplectic rook monoids. We find that there are four kinds of nonuniform congruences on the orthogonal rook monoids {OR}_n for even n\ne 4, and we describe each kind of the congruences explicitly in terms of normal subgroups of maximal subgroups. We also find that if n = 4, there are six kinds of nonuniform congruences on {OR}_4, and we describe these congruences using both \mathcal{H}-relations and certain normal subgroups of some maximal subgroups. In contrast, we find that there is only one kind of congruences on the symplectic rook monoids for all even n\ge 2.
