We show that if the Sylow p-subgroup of a finite group G is of order p, then the normalized unit group of the integral group ring of G contains a normalized unit of order pq if and only if G contains an element of order pq, where q is any prime. We use this result to answer the Prime Graph Question for most sporadic simple groups and some simple groups of Lie type, including a new infinite series of such groups. Our methods are based on the understanding of blocks of cyclic defect and Young tableaux combinatorics.
