Out(F_n):=Aut(F_n)/Inn(F_n) denotes the outer automorphism group of the rank n free group F_n. An element \phi of Out(F_n) is polynomially growing if the word lengths of conjugacy classes in F_n grow at most polynomially under iteration by \phi. We restrict attention to the subset UPG(F_n) of Out(F_n) consisting of polynomially growing elements whose action on H_1(F_n, Z) is unipotent. In particular, if \phi is polynomially growing and acts trivially on H_1(F_n,Z_3) then \phi is in UPG(F_n) and also every polynomially growing element of Out(F_n) has a positive power that is in UPG(F_n). In this paper we solve the conjugacy problem for UPG(F_n). Specifically we construct an algorithm that takes as input \phi, \psi\in UPG(F_n) and outputs YES or NO depending on whether or not there is \theta\in Out(F_n) such that \psi=\theta\phi\theta^{-1}. Further, if YES then such a \theta is produced.
