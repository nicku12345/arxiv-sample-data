Let A\neq A_1, A_2, I_{2m} be an irreducible Artin--Tits group of spherical type. We show that periodic elements of A and the elements preserving some parabolic subgroup of A act elliptically on the additional length graph \mathcal{C}_{AL}(A), an hyperbolic, infinite diameter graph associated to A constructed by Calvez and Wiest to show that A/Z(A) is acylindrically hyperbolic. We use these results to find an element g\in A such that \langle P,g \rangle\cong P* \langle g \rangle for every proper standard parabolic subgroup P of A. The length of g is uniformly bounded with respect to the Garside generators, independently of A. This allows us to show that, in contrast with the Artin generators case, the sequence \{\omega(A_n,\mathcal{S})\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}} of exponential growth rates of braid groups with respect to the Garside generating set, goes to infinity.
