As an appropriate generalisation of the features of the classical (Schein) theory of representations of inverse semigroups in \mathscr{I}_{X}, a theory of representations of inverse semigroups by homomorphisms into complete atomistic inverse algebras is developed. This class of inverse algebras includes partial automorphism monoids of entities such as graphs, vector spaces and modules. A workable theory of decompositions is reached; however complete distributivity is required for results approaching those of the classical case.
