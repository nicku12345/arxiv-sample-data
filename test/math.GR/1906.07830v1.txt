Let G be a group. We denote by \nu(G) a certain extension of the non-abelian tensor square [G,G^{\varphi}] by G \times G. We prove that if G is a finite potent p-group, then [G,G^{\varphi}] and the k-th term of the lower central series \gamma_k(\nu(G)) are potently embedded in \nu(G) (Theorem A). Moreover, we show that if G is a potent p-group, then the exponent \exp(\nu(G)) divides p \cdot \exp(G) (Theorem B). We also study the weak commutativity construction of powerful p-groups (Theorem C).
