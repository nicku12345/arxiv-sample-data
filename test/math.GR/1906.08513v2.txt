Let G be a group and write \mbox{Perm}(G) for its symmetric group. Define \mbox{Hol}(G) to be the holomorph of G, regarded as a subgroup of \mbox{Perm}(G), and let \mbox{NHol}(G) denote its normalizer. The quotient T(G) = \mbox{NHol}(G)/\mbox{Hol}(G) has been computed for various families of groups G, and in most of the known cases, it turns out to be elementary 2-abelian, except for two groups of order 16 and some groups of odd prime power order and nilpotency class two. In this paper, we shall show that T(G) is elementary 2-abelian for all finite groups G of squarefree order, and that T(G) is not a 2-group for certain finite p-groups G of nilpotency class at most p-1.
