For a strongly connected category \mathcal C with pair-wise coproducts, we introduce a cosimplicial object, which serves as a sort of resolution for computing higher derived functors of {\sf lim} : \mathrm{Ab}^{\mathcal C}\to \mathrm{Ab}. Applications involve K\"unneth theorem for higher limits and {\sf lim}-finiteness of {\bf fr}-codes. A dictionary for the {\bf fr}-codes with words of length \leq 3 is given.
