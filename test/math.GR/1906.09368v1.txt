The algebraic mapping torus M_{\Phi} of a group G with an automorphism \Phi is the HNN-extension of G in which conjugation by the stable letter performs \Phi. We classify the Dehn functions of M_{\Phi} in terms of \Phi for a number of right-angled Artin groups G, including all 3-generator right-angled Artin groups and F_k \times F_l for all k,l \geq 2.
