In the paper, we develop further the properties of Schur rings over infinite groups, with particular emphasis on the virtually cyclic group \mathcal{Z}\times\mathcal{Z}_p. We provide structure theorems for primitive sets in these Schur rings. In the case of Fermat and safe primes, a complete classification theorem is proven which states that all Schur rings over \mathcal{Z}\times\mathcal{Z}_p are traditional. We also draw analogs between Schur rings over \mathcal{Z}\times\mathcal{Z}_p and partitions of difference sets over \mathcal{Z}_p.
