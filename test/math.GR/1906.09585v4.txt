It is a longstanding conjecture that for a finite group G, the exponent of the second homology group H_2(G, \mathbb{Z}) divides the exponent of G. In this paper, we prove this conjecture for p-groups of class at most p, finite nilpotent groups of odd exponent and of nilpotency class 5, p-central metabelian p-groups, and groups considered by L. E . Wilson in \cite{LEW}. Moreover, we improve several bounds given by various authors. We achieve most of our results using an induction argument.
