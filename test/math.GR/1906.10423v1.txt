We develop practical techniques to compute with arithmetic groups H\leq \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Q}) for n>2. Our approach relies on constructing a principal congruence subgroup in H. Problems solved include testing membership in H, analyzing the subnormal structure of H, and the orbit-stabilizer problem for H. Effective computation with subgroups of \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Z}_m) is vital to this work. All algorithms have been implemented in GAP.
