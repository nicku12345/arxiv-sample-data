Strongly bounded groups are those groups for which every action by isometries on a metric space has orbits of finite diameter. Many groups have been shown to have this property, and all the known infinite examples so far have cardinality at least 2^{\aleph_0}. We produce examples of strongly bounded groups of many cardinalities, including \aleph_1, answering a question of Yves de Cornulier [4]. In fact, any infinite group embeds as a subgroup of a strongly bounded group which is, at most, two cardinalities larger.
