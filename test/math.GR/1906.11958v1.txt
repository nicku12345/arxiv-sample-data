In this work we prove that, given a simplicial graph \Gamma and a family \mathcal{G} of linear groups over a domain R, the graph product \Gamma\mathcal{G} is linear over R[\underline t], where \underline t is a tuple of finitely many linearly independent variables. As a consequence we obtain that any graph product of finitely many groups linear over the complex numbers is again a linear group over the complex numbers. This solves an open problem of Hsu and Wise in the case of faithful representations over \mathbb C.
