The operator, \chi , of weak commutativity between isomorphic groups G and G^{\varphi } was introduced by Sidki as \begin{equation*} \chi (G)=\left\langle G \cup G^{\varphi }\mid \lbrack g,g^{\varphi }]=1\,\forall \,g\in G\right\rangle \text{.} \end{equation*} It is known that the operator \chi  preserves group properties such as finiteness, solubility and also nilpotency for finitely generated groups. We prove that if G is a locally finite group with exp(G)=n, then \chi(G) is locally finite and has finite n-bounded exponent. Further, we examine some finiteness criteria for the subgroup D(G) = \langle [g_1,g_2^{\varphi}] \mid g_i \in G\rangle \leqslant \chi(G) in terms of the set \{[g_1,g_2^{\varphi}] \mid g_i \in G\}.
