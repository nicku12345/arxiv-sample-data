The goal is to extend a non-standard amenability test for groups, based on random walks and superharmonic functions, to group actions on sets, and to apply it to Thompson's group F using certain properties of extensive amenability. While no conclusive answer regarding the amenability of F is given, the approach is helpful in developing a new potentially useful criterion and testing it on a significant subclass of superharmonic functions.
