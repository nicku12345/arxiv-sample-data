Let G be a finite group admitting a coprime automorphism \phi of order n. Denote by G_{\phi} the centralizer of \phi in G and by G_{-\phi} the set \{ x^{-1}x^{\phi}; \ x\in G\}. We prove the following results.   1. If every element from G_{\phi}\cup G_{-\phi} is contained in a \phi-invariant subgroup of exponent dividing e, then the exponent of G is (e,n)-bounded.   2. Suppose that G_{\phi} is nilpotent of class c. If x^{e}=1 for each x \in G_{-\phi} and any two elements of G_{-\phi} are contained in a \phi-invariant soluble subgroup of derived length d, then the exponent of [G,\phi] is bounded in terms of c,d,e,n.
