Let F be an algebraically closed field of zero characteristic. If the transcendence degree of F over \mathbb{Q} is finite, then all Chevalley groups over F are known to possess the R_{\infty}-property. If the transcendence degree of F over \mathbb{Q} is infinite, then Chevalley groups of type A_n over F do not possess the R_{\infty}-property. In the present paper, we consider Chevalley groups of classical series B_n, C_n, D_n over F in the case when the transcendence degree of F over \mathbb{Q} is infinite, and prove that such groups do not possess the R_{\infty}-property.
