The work of Greither and Pareigis details the enumeration of the Hopf-Galois structures (if any) on a given separable field extension. For an extension L/K which is classically Galois with G=Gal(L/K) the Hopf algebras in question are of the form (L[N])^{G} where N\leq B=Perm(G) is a regular subgroup that is normalized by the left regular representation \lambda(G)\leq B. We consider the case where both G and N are isomorphic to a dihedral group D_n for any n\geq 3. Using the normal block systems inherent to the left regular representation of each D_n,(and every other regular permutation group isomorphic to D_n) we explicitly enumerate all possible such N which arise.
