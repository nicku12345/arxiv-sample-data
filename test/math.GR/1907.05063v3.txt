We introduce various probablistic finiteness conditions for profinite groups related to positive finite generation (PFG). We investigate completed group rings which are PFG as modules, and use this to answer a question of Kionke and the second author on positively finitely related groups. Using the theory of projective covers, we define and characterise a probabilistic version of the \mathrm{FP}_n property for profinite groups, called \mathrm{PFP}_n. Finally, we prove how these conditions are related to previously defined finiteness conditions and each other.
