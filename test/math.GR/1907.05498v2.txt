Every finite simple group can be generated by two elements, and Guralnick and Kantor proved that, moreover, every nontrivial element is contained in a generating pair. Groups with this property are said to be \frac{3}{2}-generated. Thompson's group V was the first finitely presented infinite simple group to be discovered. The Higman--Thompson groups V_n and the Brin--Thompson groups mV are two families of finitely presented groups that generalise V. In this paper, we prove that all of the groups V_n, V_n' and mV are \frac{3}{2}-generated. As far as the authors are aware, the only previously known examples of infinite noncyclic \frac{3}{2}-generated groups are the pathological Tarski monsters. We conclude with several open questions motivated by our results.
