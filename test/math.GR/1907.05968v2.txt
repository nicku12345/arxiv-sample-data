The local to global property for an equation \psi over a group G asks to show that \psi is solvable in G if and only if it is solvable in every finite quotient of G. In this paper we focus that in order to prove this local to global property for free groups G=F_k, it is enough to prove for k less or equal the number of parameters in \psi. In particular we use it to show that the local to global property holds for m-powers in free groups.
