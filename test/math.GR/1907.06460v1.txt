Let p be a prime, G a finite \mathcal{K}_p-group, S a Sylow p-subgroup of G and Q be a large subgroup of G in S. The aim of the Local Structure Theorem is to provide structural information about subgroups L with S \leq L, O_p(L) \not= 1 and L \not\leq N_G(Q). There is, however, one configuration where no structural information about L can be given using the methods in the proof of the Local Structure Theorem. In this paper we show that for p=2 this hypothetical configuration cannot occur. We anticipate that our theorem will be used in the programme to revise the classification of the finite simple groups.
