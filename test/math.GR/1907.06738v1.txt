We introduce the notion of strictly systolic angled complexes. They generalize Januszkiewickz and \'Swi\k{a}tkowski's 7-systolic simplicial complexes and also their metric counterparts, which appear as natural analogues to Huang and Osajda's metrically systolic simplicial complexes in the context of negative curvature. We prove that strictly systolic angled complexes and the groups that act on them geometrically, together with their finitely presented subgroups, are hyperbolic. We use these complexes to study the geometry of one-relator groups without torsion, and prove hyperbolicity of such groups under a metric small cancellation hypothesis, weaker than C'(1/6) and C'(1/4)-T(4).
