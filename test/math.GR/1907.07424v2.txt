Topological full groups originated from the theory of topological dynamical systems and have been having considerable impact on group theory in recent years. This text represents an introduction/survey on topological full groups. After development of the theoretical and historical background, it gives an account of their significance in topological dynamics and discusses their group theoretical aspects.
