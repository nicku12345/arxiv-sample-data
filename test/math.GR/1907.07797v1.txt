We generalise a key result of one-relator group theory, namely Magnus's Freiheitssatz, to partially commutative groups, under sufficiently strong conditions on the relator. The main theorem shows that under our conditions, on an element r of a partially commutative group \mathbb{G}, certain Magnus subgroups embed in the quotient G=\mathbb{G}/N(r); that if r=s^n has root s in \mathbb{G} then the order of s in G is n, and under slightly stronger conditions that the word problem of G is decidable. We also give conditions under which the question of which Magnus subgroups of \mathbb{G} embed in G reduces to the same question in the minimal parabolic subgroup of \mathbb{G} containing r. In many cases this allows us to characterise Magnus subgroups which embed in G, via a condition on r and the commutation graph of \mathbb{G}, and to find further examples of quotients G where the word and conjugacy problems are decidable. We give evidence that situations in which our main theorem applies are not uncommon, by proving that for cycle graphs with a chord \Gamma, almost all cyclically reduced elements of the partially commutative group \mathbb{G}(\Gamma) satisfy the conditions of the theorem.
