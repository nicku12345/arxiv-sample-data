We present novel constructions concerning the homology of finitely generated groups. Each construction draws on ideas of Gilbert Baumslag. There is a finitely presented acyclic group U such that U has no proper subgroups of finite index and every finitely presented group can be embedded in U. There is no algorithm that can determine whether or not a finitely presentable subgroup of a residually finite, biautomatic group is perfect. For every recursively presented abelian group A there exists a pair of groups i:P_A\hookrightarrow G_A such that i induces an isomorphism of profinite completions, where G_A is a torsion-free biautomatic group that is residually finite and superperfect, while P_A is a finitely generated group with H_2(P_A,\mathbb{Z})\cong A.
