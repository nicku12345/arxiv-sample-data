We describe homomorphisms \varphi:H\rightarrow G for which the codomain is acylindrically hyperbolic and the domain is a topological group which is either completely metrizable or locally countably compact Hausdorff. It is shown that, in a certain sense, either the image of \varphi is small or \varphi is almost continuous. We also describe homomorphisms from the Hawaiian earring group to G as above. We prove a more precise result for homomorphisms \varphi:H\rightarrow {\rm Mod}(\Sigma), where H as above and {\rm Mod}(\Sigma) is the mapping class group of a connected compact surface \Sigma. In this case there exists an open normal subgroup V\leqslant H such that \varphi(V) is finite. We also prove the analogous statement for homomorphisms \varphi:H\rightarrow {\rm Out}(G), where G is a one-ended hyperbolic group. Some automatic continuity results for relatively hyperbolic groups and fundamental groups of graphs of groups are also deduced. As a by-product, we prove that the Hawaiian earring group is acylindrically hyperbolic, but does not admit any universal acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space.
