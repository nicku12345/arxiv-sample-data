Guralnick, Kantor, Kassabov and Lubotzky (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 13.2, 2011, 391-458) [GKKL] give 3-generator 7-relator presentations of A_n and S_n with bit-length O(\log n) for n\geq5. This is the best possible bit-length, since \Omega(\log n) bits are required to specify the integer n in the input. However, the generators do not satisfy the relations.   This paper considers the relevant arguments given in [GKKL], identifies where the errors occur, and shows how they can be fixed in order to recover this result. The presentations are available in Magma.
