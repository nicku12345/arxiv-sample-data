Let G be a finite solvable group and H be a subgroup of Aut(G). Suppose that there exists an H-invariant Carter subgroup F of G such that the semidirect product FH is a Frobenius group with kernel F. We prove that the terms of the Fitting series of C_{G}(H) are obtained as the intersection of C_{G}(H) with the corresponding terms of the Fitting series of G, and the Fitting height of G may exceed the Fitting height of C_{G}(H) by at most one. As a corollary it is shown that for any set of primes \pi, the terms of the \pi-series of C_{G}(H) is obtained as the intersection of C_{G}(H) with the corresponding terms of the \pi-series of G, and the \pi-length of G may exceed the \pi-length of C_{G}(H) by at most one. They generalize the main results of \cite{Khu}.
