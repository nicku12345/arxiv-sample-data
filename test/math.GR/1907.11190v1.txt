Let n be a positive integer and let G be a group. We denote by \nu(G) a certain extension of the non-abelian tensor square G \otimes G by G \times G. Set T_{\otimes}(G) = \{g \otimes h \mid g,h \in G\}. We prove that if the size of the conjugacy class \left |x^{\nu(G)} \right| \leq n for every x \in T_{\otimes}(G), then the second derived subgroup \nu(G)'' is finite with n-bounded order. Moreover, we obtain a sufficient condition for a group to be a BFC-group.
