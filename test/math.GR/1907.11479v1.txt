It is well known that the set of values of a lower central word in a group G need not be a subgroup. For a fixed lower central word \gamma_r and for p\ge 5, Guralnick showed that if G is a finite p-group such that the verbal subgroup \gamma_r(G) is abelian and 2-generator, then \gamma_r(G) consists only of \gamma_r-values. In this paper we extend this result, showing that the assumption that \gamma_r(G) is abelian can be dropped. Moreover, we show that the result remains true even if p=3. Finally, we prove that the analogous result for pro-p groups is true.
