For a finite group G, let \Delta(G) denote the character graph built on the set of degrees of the irreducible complex characters of G. In graph theory, a perfect graph is a graph \Gamma in which the chromatic number of every induced subgraph \Delta of \Gamma equals the clique number of \Delta. In this paper, we show that the character graph \Delta(G) of a finite group G is always a perfect graph. We also prove that the chromatic number of the complement of \Delta(G) is at most three.
