For an odd prime p and a positive integer n, it is well known that there are two types of extra-special p-groups of order p^{2n+1}, first one is the Heisenberg group which has exponent p and the second one is of exponent p^2. In this article, a new way of representing the extra-special p-group of exponent p^2 is given. These representations facilitate an explicit way of finding formulae for any endomorphism and any automorphism of an extra-special p-group G for both the types. Based on these formulae, the endomorphism semigroup End(G) and the automorphism group Aut(G) are described. The endomorphism semigroup image of any element in G is found and the orbits under the action of the automorphism group Aut(G) are determined. As a consequence it is deduced that, under the notion of degeneration of elements in G, the endomorphism semigroup End(G) induces a partial order on the automorphism orbits when G is the Heisenberg group and does not induce when G is the extra-special p-group of exponent p^2. Finally we prove that the cardinality of isotropic subspaces of any fixed dimension in a non-degenerate symplectic space is a polynomial in p with non-negative integer coefficients. Using this fact we compute the cardinality of End(G).
