We study the orbits under the natural action of a permutation group G \subseteq S_n on the powerset \mathscr{P}(\{1, \dots , n\}). The permutation groups having exactly n+1 orbits on the powerset can be characterized as set-transitive groups and were fully classified in \cite{BP55}. In this paper, we establish a general method that allows one to classify the permutation groups with n+r set-orbits for a given r, and apply it to integers 2 \leq r \leq 11 using the computer algebra system GAP.
