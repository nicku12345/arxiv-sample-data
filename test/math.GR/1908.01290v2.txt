We study the cohomology of group theoretic Dehn fillings. Applying the Cohen-Lyndon property for sufficiently deep Dehn fillings of hyperbolically embedded subgroups H\hookrightarrow_h G, obtained by the second named author, we derive a spectral sequence that computes the cohomology of the corresponding Dehn filling quotients \bar G. We also establish an algebraic analog of excision, namely an isomorphism between the relative cohomology of the group pair (G, H) and its sufficiently deep Dehn filling quotient pair (\bar G, \bar H). As an application of both, under natural hypothesis, we show that if (G, H) is an orientable Poincar\'e duality pair, then its sufficiently deep Dehn filling \bar G is a orientable Poincar\'e duality group. As another application, we generalize a result of Fujiwara-Manning on simplicial volume of Dehn fillings of hyperbolic manifolds to Dehn fillings of Poincar\'e duality pairs.   We then turn to quotients of acylindrically hyperbolic groups. We generalize the results of Dahmani-Guirardel-Osin and Hull on SQ-universality and common quotients of acylindrically hyperbolic groups by adding cohomological finiteness conditions. We apply these results to obtain quotients of acylindrically hyperbolic groups with special properties. For example, we show that every acylindrically hyperbolic group G of type FP_{\infty} contains a family of acylindrically hyperbolic quotients \{G_k\}^{\infty}_{k=2} where each G_k has Kazhdan's Property (T), is of type FP_{k-1} but not of type FP_{k}.
