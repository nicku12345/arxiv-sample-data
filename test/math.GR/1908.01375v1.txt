Let G be a group. The orbits of the natural action of Aut(G) on G are called ``automorphism orbits'' of G, and the number of automorphism orbits of G is denoted by \omega(G). We prove that if G is a soluble group with finite rank such that \omega(G)< \infty, then G contains a torsion-free characteristic nilpotent subgroup K such that G = K \rtimes H, where H is a finite group. Moreover, we classify the mixed order soluble groups of finite rank such that \omega(G)=3.
