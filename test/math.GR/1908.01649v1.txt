Given a finite group G, the generating graph \Gamma(G) of G has as vertices the non-identity elements of G and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are distinct and generate G as group elements. Let G be a 2-generated finite group. We prove that \Gamma(G) is planar if and only if G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5, C_6, C_2 \times C_2, D_3, D_4, Q_8, C_4\times C_2, D_6.
