We say that a subset X quasi-isometrically boundedly generates a finitely generated group \Gamma if each element \gamma of a finite-index subgroup of \Gamma can be written as a product \gamma = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_r of a bounded number of elements of X, such that the word length of each x_i is bounded by a constant times the word length of \gamma. A. Lubotzky, S. Mozes, and M.S. Raghunathan observed in 1993 that {\rm SL}(n,{\mathbb Z}) is quasi-isometrically boundedly generated by the elements of its natural {\rm SL}(2,{\mathbb Z}) subgroups. We generalize (a slightly weakened version of) this by showing that every S-arithmetic subgroup of an isotropic, almost-simple {\mathbb Q}-group is quasi-isometrically boundedly generated by standard {\mathbb Q}-rank-1 subgroups.
