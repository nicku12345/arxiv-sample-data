In this paper we address the celebrated Albert problem for exceptional Jordan algebras (i.e. Albert algebras): Does every Albert division algebra contain a cubic cyclic subfield? We prove that for any Albert division algebra A over a field k of arbitrary characteristic, there is a suitable isotope that contains a cubic cyclic subfield. It follows from this that for any Albert division algebra A over a field k, the structure group \text{\bf Str}(A) always contains a subgroup of type ^3D_4 defined over k.
