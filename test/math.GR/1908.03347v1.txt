A remarkable result of Thompson states that a finite group is soluble if and only if its two-generated subgroups are soluble. This result has been generalized in numerous ways, and it is in the core of a wide area of research in the theory of groups, aiming for global properties of groups from local properties of two-generated (or more generally, n-generated) subgroups. We contribute an extension of Thompson's theorem from the perspective of factorized groups. More precisely, we study finite groups G = AB with subgroups A,\ B such that \langle a, b\rangle is soluble for all a \in A and b \in B. In this case, the group G is said to be an \cal S-connected product of the subgroups A and B for the class \cal S of all finite soluble groups. Our main theorem states that G = AB is \cal S-connected if and only if [A,B] is soluble. In the course of the proof we derive a result of own interest about independent primes regarding the soluble graph of almost simple groups.
