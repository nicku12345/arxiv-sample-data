Every word in a free group F induces a probability measure on every finite group in a natural manner. It is an open problem whether two words that induce the same measure on every finite group, necessarily belong to the same orbit of \mathrm{Aut}F. A special case of this problem, when one of the words is the primitive word x, was settled positively by the third author and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269]. Here we extend this result to the case where one of the words is x^d or \left[x,y\right]^{d} for an arbitrary d\in\mathbb{Z}.
