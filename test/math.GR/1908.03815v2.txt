We show that for any full and sufficiently transitive (i.e. \textit{flexible}) group G of homeomorphisms of Cantor space, \mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(G)) = \mathrm{Aut}(G). This class contains many generalisations of the Higman-Thompson groups G_{n,r}, and the Rational group \mathcal{R}_{2} of Grigorchuk, Nekrashevych, and Suchanski{\u \i}. We also demonstrate that for generalisations T_{n,r} of R. Thompson's group T, \mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(T_{n,r}))= \mathrm{Aut}(T_{n,r}). In the case of the groups G_{n,r} and T_{n,r} our results extend results of Brin and Guzm{\' a}n for Thompson's group T, and generalisations of Thompson's group F.
