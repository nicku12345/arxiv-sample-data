The MLS conjecture states that every finite simple group has a minimal logarithmic signature. The aim of this paper is proving the existence of a minimal logarithmic signature for some simple unitary groups PSU_{n}(q). We report a gap in the proof of the main result of [H. Hong, L. Wang, Y. Yang, Minimal logarithmic signatures for the unitary group U_n(q), \textit{Des. Codes Cryptogr.} \textbf{77} (1) (2015) 179--191] and present a new proof in some special cases of this result. As a consequence, the MLS conjecture is still open.
