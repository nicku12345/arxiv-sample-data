The mathematics of shuffling a deck of 2n cards with two "perfect shuffles" was brought into clarity by Diaconis, Graham and Kantor. Here we consider a generalisation of this problem, with a so-called "many handed dealer" shuffling kn cards by cutting into k piles with n cards in each pile and using k! shuffles. A conjecture of Medvedoff and Morrison suggests that all possible permutations of the deck of cards are achieved, so long as k\neq 4 and n is not a power of k. We confirm this conjecture for three doubly infinite families of integers: all (k,n) with k>n; all (k, n)\in \{ (\ell^e, \ell^f )\mid \ell \geqslant 2, \ell^e>4, f \ \mbox{not a multiple of}\ e\}; and all (k,n) with k=2^e\geqslant 4 and n not a power of 2. We open up a more general study of shuffle groups, which admit an arbitrary subgroup of shuffles.
