The following problem was originally posed by B.H. Neumann and H. Neumann. Suppose that a group G can be generated by n elements and that H is a homomorphic image of G. Does there exist, for every generating n-tuple (h_1,\ldots, h_n) of H, a homomorphism \vartheta \colon G \to H and a generating n-tuple (g_1,\ldots,g_n) of G such that (g_1^\vartheta,\ldots,g_n^\vartheta) = (h_1,\ldots,h_n)?   M.J. Dunwoody gave a negative answer to this question, by means of a carefully engineered construction of an explicit pair of soluble groups. Via a new approach we produce, for n = 2, infinitely many pairs of groups (G,H) that are negative examples to the Neumanns' problem. These new examples are easily described: G is a free product of two suitable finite cyclic groups, such as C_2 \ast C_3, and H is a suitable finite projective special linear group, such as \mathrm{PSL}(2,p) for a prime p \ge 5. A small modification yields the first negative examples (G,H) with H infinite.
