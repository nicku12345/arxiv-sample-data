The replacement property (or Steinitz Exchange Lemma) for vector spaces has a natural analog for finite groups and their generating sets. For the special case of the groups PSL(2, p), where p is a prime larger than 5, first partial results concerning the replacement property were published by Benjamin Nachman [7]. The main goal of this paper is to provide a complete answer for PSL(2, p).
