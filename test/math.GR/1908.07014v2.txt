In this note we show that the family of Cayley graphs of a finitely generated subgroup of {\rm GL}_{n_0}(\mathbb{F}_p(t)) modulo some admissible square-free polynomials is a family of expanders under certain algebraic conditions.   Here is a more precise formulation of our main result. For a positive integer c_0, we say a square-free polynomial is c_0-admissible if degree of irreducible factors of f are distinct integers with prime factors at least c_0. Suppose \Omega is a finite symmetric subset of {\rm GL}_{n_0}(\mathbb{F}_p(t)), where p is a prime more than 5. Let \Gamma be the group generated by \Omega. Suppose the Zariski-closure of \Gamma is connected, simply-connected, and absolutely almost simple; further assume that the field generated by the traces of {\rm Ad}(\Gamma) is \mathbb{F}_p(t). Then for some positive integer c_0 the family of Cayley graphs {\rm Cay}(\pi_{f(x)}(\Gamma),\pi_{f(x)}(\Omega)) as f ranges in the set of c_0-admissible polynomials is a family of expanders, where \pi_{f(t)} is the quotient map for the congruence modulo f(t).
