If w is a word in d>1 letters and G is a finite group, evaluation of w on a uniformly randomly chosen d-tuple in G gives a random variable with values in G, which may or may not be uniform. It is known that if G ranges over finite simple groups of given root system and characteristic, a positive proportion of words w give a distribution which approaches uniformity in the limit as |G| goes to infinity. In this paper, we show that the proportion is in fact 1.
