Let G be a group and Z(G) be its center. We associate a commuting graph {\Gamma}(G), whose vertex set is G\setminus Z(G) and two distinct vertices are adjacent if they commute. We say that {\Gamma}(G) is strong k star free if the k star graph is not a subgraph of {\Gamma}(G). In this paper, we characterize all strong 5 star free commuting graphs. As a byproduct, we classify all strong claw-free graphs. Also, we prove that the set of all non-abelian groups whose commuting graph is strong k star free is finite.
