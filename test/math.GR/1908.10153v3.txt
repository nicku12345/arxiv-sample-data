We suggest a modified and briefer version for the proof of Higman's embedding theorem stating that a finitely generated group can be embedded in a finitely presented group if and only if it is recursively presented. In particular, we shorten the main part of original proof establishing characterization of recursive relations in terms of benign subgroups in free groups. Also, some technical lemmas on homomorphisms are replaced by simple combinatorial observations on words in free constructions.
