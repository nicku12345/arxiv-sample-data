Let G be a finite group and P\in Syl_p(G). We denote the k'th term of the upper central series of G by Z_k(G) and the norm of G by Z^*(G). In this article, we prove that if for every tame intersection P\cap Q such that Z_{p-1}(P)<P\cap Q<P, the group N_G(P\cap Q) is p-nilpotent then N_G(P) controls p-transfer in G. For p=2, we sharpen our results by proving if for every tame intersection P\cap Q such that Z^*(P)<P\cap Q<P, the group N_G(P\cap Q) is p-nilpotent then N_G(P) controls p-transfer in G. We also obtain several corollaries which give sufficient conditions for N_G(P) to controls p-transfer in G as a generalization of some well known theorems, including Hall-Wielandt theorem and Frobenius normal complement theorem.
