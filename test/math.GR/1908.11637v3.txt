An Engel sink of an element g of a group G is a set {\mathscr E}(g) such that for every x\in G all sufficiently long commutators [...[[x,g],g],\dots ,g] belong to {\mathscr E}(g). (Thus, g is an Engel element precisely when we can choose {\mathscr E}(g)=\{ 1\}.) It is proved that if every element of a compact (Hausdorff) group G has a countable (or finite) Engel sink, then G has a finite normal subgroup N such that G/N is locally nilpotent. This settles a question suggested by J. S. Wilson.
