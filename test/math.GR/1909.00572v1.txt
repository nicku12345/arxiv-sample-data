An even Artin group is a group which has a presentation with relations of the form (st)^n=(ts)^n with n\ge 1. With a group G we associate a Lie \mathbb Z-algebra \mathcal{TG}r(G). This is the usual Lie algebra defined from the lower central series, truncated at the third rank. For each even Artin group G we determine a presentation for \mathcal{TG}r(G). Then we prove a criterion to determine whether two Coxeter matrices are isomorphic. Let c,d\in\mathbb N such that c\ge1, d\ge2 and \gcd(c,d)=1. We show that, if two even Artin groups G and G' having presentations with relations of the form (st)^n=(ts)^n with n\in\{c\}\cup\{d^k\mid k\ge1\} are such that \mathcal{TG}r(G)\simeq\mathcal{TG}r(G'), then G and G' have the same presentation up to permutation of the generators. On the other hand, we show an example of two non-isomorphic even Artin groups G and G' such that \mathcal{TG}r(G)\simeq\mathcal{TG}r(G').
