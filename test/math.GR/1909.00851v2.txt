For every prime p\geq5, we give examples of Beauville p-groups whose Beauville structures are never strongly real. This shows that there are purely non-strongly real nilpotent Beauville groups. On the other hand, we determine infinitely many Beauville 2-groups which are purely strongly real. This answers two questions formulated by Fairbairn in [8].
