For a finite group G, let \Delta(G) denote the character graph built on the set of degrees of the irreducible complex characters of G. In this paper, we determine the structure of all finite groups G with K_4-free character graph \Delta(G) having seven vertices. We also obtain a classification of all K_4-free graphs with seven vertices which can occur as character graphs of some finite groups.
