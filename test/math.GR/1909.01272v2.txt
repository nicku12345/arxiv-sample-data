Grigorchuk's Overgroup \tilde{\mathcal{G}}, is a branch group of intermediate growth. It contains the first Grigorchuk's torsion group \mathcal{G} of intermediate growth constructed in 1980, but also has elements of infinite order. It's growth is substantially greater than the growth of \mathcal{G}. The group \mathcal{G}, corresponding to the sequence (012)^\infty = 012012 ..., is a member of the family \{ G_\omega | \omega \in \Omega = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}^\mathbb{N} \} consisting of groups of intermediate growth when sequence \omega is not virtually constant. Following this construction we define the family \{ \tilde{G}_\omega, \omega \in \Omega \} of generalized overgroups. Then \tilde{\mathcal{G}} = \tilde{G}_{(012)^\infty} and G_\omega is a subgroup of \tilde{G}_\omega for each \omega \in \Omega. We prove, if \omega is eventually constant, then \tilde{G}_\omega is of polynomial growth and if \omega is not eventually constant, then \tilde{G}_\omega is of intermediate growth.
