The purpose of this note is to introduce a trick which relates the (non)-vanishing of the top-dimensional \ell 2-Betti numbers of actions with that of sub-actions. We provide three different types of applications: we prove that the \ell 2-Betti numbers of Aut(F_n) and Out(F_n) (and of their Torelli subgroups) do not vanish in degree equal to their virtual cohomological dimension, we prove that the subgroups of the 3-manifold groups have vanishing \ell 2-Betti numbers in degree 3 and 2 and we prove for instance that F_2^d \times Z has ergodic dimension d + 1.
