We answer the question by Matt Brin on the structure of diagram groups over semigroup presentation {\mathcal P}=\langle a,b,c\mid a=bc,b=ca,c=ab\rangle. In the talk on Oberwolfach workshop, Brin conjectured that the diagram group over \mathcal P with base a is isomorphic to the generalized Thompson's group F_9. We confirm this conjecture and consider some generalizations of this fact.
