By the density of a finite graph we mean its average vertex degree. For an m-generated group, the density of its Cayley graph in a given set of generators, is the supremum of densities taken over all its finite subgraphs. It is known that a group with m generators is amenable iff the density of the corresponding Cayley graph equals 2m. A famous problem on the amenability of R.\,Thompson's group F is still open. What is known due to the result by Belk and Brown, is that the density of its Cayley graph in the standard set of group generators \{x_0,x_1\}, is at least 3.5. This estimate has not been exceeded so far. For the set of symmetric generators S=\{x_1,\bar{x}_1\}, where \bar{x}_1=x_1x_0^{-1}, the same example gave the estimate only 3. There was a conjecture that for this generating set the equality holds. If so, F would be non-amenable, and the symmetric generating set had doubling property. This means that for any finite set X\subset F, the inequality |S^{\pm1}X|\ge2|X| holds. In this paper we disprove this conjecture showing that the density of the Cayley graph of F in symmetric generators S strictly exceeds 3. Moreover, we show that even larger generating set S_0=\{x_0,x_1,\bar{x}_1\} does not have doubling property.
