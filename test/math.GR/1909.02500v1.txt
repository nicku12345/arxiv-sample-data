In this paper, we give an introduction for rough groups and rough homomorphisms. Then we present some properties related to topological rough subgroups and rough subsets. We construct the product of topological rough groups and give an illustrated example. Then, we define topological rough group homomorphisms and topological rough group homeomorphisms. Finally, we introduce a rough action, a rough homogenous space and a rough kernel.
