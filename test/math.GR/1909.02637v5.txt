We prove the Horrocks theorem for unstable even-dimensional orthogonal Steinberg groups. The Horrocks theorem for Steinberg groups is one of the principal ingredients needed for the proof of the \mathrm{K}_2-analogue of Serre's problem, whose positive solution is currently known only in the linear case.
