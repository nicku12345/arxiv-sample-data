Residual finiteness growth gives an invariant that indicates how well-approximated a finitely generated group is by its finite quotients. We briefly survey the state of the subject. We then improve on the best known upper and lower bounds for lamplighter groups. Notably, any lamplighter group has super-linear residual finiteness growth. In our proof, we quantify a congruence subgroup property for lamplighter groups.
