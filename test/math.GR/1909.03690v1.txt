A group G has a Frobenius graphical representation (GFR) if there is a simple graph \varGamma whose full automorphism group is isomorphic to G and it acts on vertices as a Frobenius group. In particular, any group G with GFR is a Frobenius group and \varGamma is a Cayley graph. The existence of an infinite family of groups with GFR whose Frobenius kernel is a non-abelian 2-group has been an open question. In this paper, we give a positive answer by showing that the Higman group A(f,q_0) has a GFR for an infinite sequence of f and q_0.
