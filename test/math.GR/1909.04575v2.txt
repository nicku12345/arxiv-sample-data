Following the construction from `Degrees of growth of finitely generated groups and the theory of invariant means' we generalize the Grigorchuk's overgroup \tilde{\mathcal{G}}, studied in `On parabolic subgroups and Hecke algebras of some fractal groups' to the family \{ \tilde{G}_\omega, \omega \in \Omega = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}^\mathbb{N} \} of generalized Grigorchuk's overgroups. We consider these groups as 8-generated and describe the closure of this family in the space \mathcal{M}_8 of marked groups.
