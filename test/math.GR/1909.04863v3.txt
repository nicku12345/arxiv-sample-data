The cyclically reduced product of two words u, v, denoted u * v, is the cyclically reduced form of the concatenation of u by v. This product is not associative. Recently S. V. Ivanov has proved that the Andrews-Curtis conjecture can be restated in terms of the cyclically reduced product and cyclic permutations instead of the reduced product and conjugations. In a previous paper we have started a thorough study of * and of the structure of the set of cyclically reduced words \hat{\mathcal{F}}(X) equipped with *. In particular we have found that a certain number of properties of the free group equipped with the reduced product can be generalized to (\hat{\mathcal{F}}(X), *). In this paper we continue this study by proving that a generalized version of the associative property holds for * in a special case. In a following paper we will prove that a more general version of the associative property holds for any case.
