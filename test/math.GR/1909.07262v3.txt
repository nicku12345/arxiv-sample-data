In this paper, we propose two cryptosystems based on group rings and existing cryptosystem. First one is Elliptic ElGamal type group ring public key cryptosystem whose security is greater than security of cryptosystems based on elliptic curves discrete logarithmic problem (ECDLP). Second is ElGamal type group ring public key cryptosystem, which is analogous to ElGamal public key cryptosystem but has comparatively greater security. Examples are also given for both the proposed cryptosystems.
