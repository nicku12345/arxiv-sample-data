By means of analyzing the notion of verbal products of groups, we show that soficity, hyperlinearity, amenability, the Haagerup property, the Kazhdan's property (T) and exactness are preserved under taking k-nilpotent products of groups, while being orderable is not. We also study these properties for solvable and Burnside products of groups. We then show that if two discrete groups are sofic, (respectively have the Haagerup property), their restricted verbal wreath product arising from nilpotent, solvable and certain Burnside products is also sofic (resp. has the Haagerup Property). We also prove related results for hyperlinear, linear sofic and weak sofic approximations. Finally, we give applications combining our work with the Shmelkin embedding to show that certain quotients of free groups are sofic or have the Haagerup property.
