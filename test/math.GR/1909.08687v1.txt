One of the most studied algebraic structures with one operation is the Abelian group, which is defined as a structure whose operation satisfies the associative and commutative properties, has identical element and every element has an inverse element. In this article, we characterize the Abelian groups with other properties and we even reduce it to two the list of properties to be fulfilled by the operation. For this, we make use of properties that, in general, are hardly ever mencioned.
