This paper is a survey on the works [MS77, MS79, MS81] on maximal subgroups in finitely generated linear groups, and the works that followed it [GG08, GG13b, GG13a, Kap03, Iva92, HO16, GM16, AGS14, Sf90, Sf98, Per05, AKT16, FG18, GS17] concerning maximal subgroups of infinite index in linear groups as well as in various other groups possessing a suitable geometry or dynamics.
