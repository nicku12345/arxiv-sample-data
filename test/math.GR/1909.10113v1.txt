For all sufficiently large odd integers n, the following version of Higman's embedding theorem is proved in the variety {\cal B}_n of all groups satisfying the identity x^n=1. A finitely generated group G from {\cal B}_n has a presentation G=\langle A\mid R\rangle with a finite set of generators A and a recursively enumerable set R of defining relations if and only if it is a subgroup of a group H finitely presented in the variety {\cal B}_n. It follows that there is a 'universal' 2-generated finitely presented in {\cal B}_n group containing isomorphic copies of all finitely presented in {\cal B}_n groups as subgroups.
