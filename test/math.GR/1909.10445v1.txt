Let H(\lambda_4) be the Hecke group \langle x,y\,:\, x^2=y^4=1 \rangle and, for a square-free positive integer n, consider the subset \mathbb{Q}^*(\sqrt{-n})=\left\{(a+\sqrt{-n})/c \, | \, a,b=(a^2+n)/c \in \mathbb{Z},\, c\in 2\mathbb{Z} \right\} of the quadratic imaginary number field \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-n}). Following a line of research in the relevant literature, we study properties of the action of H(\lambda_4) on \mathbb{Q}^*(\sqrt{-n}). In particular, we calculate the number of orbits arising from this action for every such n. Some illustrative examples are also given.
