For square-free positive integers n, we study the action of the modular group \mbox{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) on the subsets \{\,\frac{a+\sqrt{-n}}{c}\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-n})\, | \, a,b=\frac{a^2+n}{c},c \in \mathbb{Z} \,\} of the imaginary quadratic number fields \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-n}). In particular, we compute the number of orbits under this action for all such n as provide an interesting congruence property of this number. An illustrative example and a C^{++} code to calculate such a number for all 1\leq n \leq 100 are also given.
