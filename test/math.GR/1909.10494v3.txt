We study the properties of groups that have presentations in which the square of each generator gives the identity and all relations are of even length. We consider the parabolic subgroups of such a group and show that every element has a factorisation with respect to a given parabolic subgroup. Furthermore, we give a counterexample, using a cluster group presentation, which demonstrates that this factorisation is not necessarily unique.
