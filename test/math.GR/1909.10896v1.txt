A partial semigroup is a set with restricted binary operation. In this work we will extend a result due to V. Bergelson and N. Hindman concerning the rich structure presented in the product space of semigroups to partial semigroup. An IP^{\star} set in a semigroup is a set that intersect every set of the form \left\{ FS(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}:x_{n}\in S\right\} . V. Bergelson and N. Hindman proved that if S_{1},S_{2},\ldots,S_{l} are finite collection of commutative semigroup, then under certain condition, an IP^{\star} set in S_{1}\times S_{2}\times\ldots\times S_{l} contains cartesian products of arbitrarily large finite substructures of the form FS\left(x_{1,n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\times FS\left(x_{2,n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\times\ldots\times FS\left(x_{l,n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}. In this work we will extend this result to countable adequate commutative partial semigroup.
