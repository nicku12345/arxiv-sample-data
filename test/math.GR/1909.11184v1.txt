The fuzzification of classical set theory came into existence when Zadeh [1] laid down the concept of a fuzzy set as a generalization of a crisp set. The objective of this paper is to extend the concept of fuzzy endomorphism to fuzzy automorphism. Notions of fuzzy inner automorphism and fuzzy inner automorphism induced by a fuzzy subgroup are introduced. Finally, we obtain the fuzzy analogues of well-known results of classical group theory.
