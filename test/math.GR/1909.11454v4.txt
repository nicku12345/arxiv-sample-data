Let G=(V,E) be a graph with the vertex-set V and the edge-set E. Let N(v) denote the set of neighbors of the vertex v of G. The graph G is called  irreducible  whenever for every v,w \in V if v \neq w, then N(v)\neq N(w). In this paper, we present a method for finding automorphism groups of connected bipartite irreducible graphs. Then, by our method, we determine automorphism groups of some classes of connected bipartite irreducible graphs, including a class of graphs which are derived from Grassmann graphs. Let a_0 be a fixed positive integer. We show that if G is a connected non-bipartite irreducible graph such that c(v,w)=|N(v)\cap N(w)|=a_0 when v,w are adjacent, whereas c(v,w) \neq a_0, when v,w are not adjacent, then G is a stable graph, that is, the automorphism group of the bipartite double cover of G is isomorphic with the group Aut(G) \times \mathbb{Z}_2. Finally, we show that the Johnson graph J(n,k) is a stable graph.
