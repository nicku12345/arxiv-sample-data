Let G be a group and Sol(G)=\{x \in G : \langle x,y \rangle \text{ is solvable for all } y \in G\}. We associate a graph \mathcal{NS}_G (called the non-solvable graph of G) with G whose vertex set is G \setminus Sol(G) and two distinct vertices are adjacent if they generate a non-solvable subgroup. In this paper we study many properties of \mathcal{NS}_G. In particular, we obtain results on vertex degree, cardinality of vertex degree set, graph realization, domination number, vertex connectivity, independence number and clique number of \mathcal{NS}_G. We also consider two groups G and H having isomorphic non-solvable graphs and derive some properties of G and H. Finally, we conclude this paper by showing that \mathcal{NS}_G is neither planar, toroidal, double-toroidal, triple-toroidal nor projective.
