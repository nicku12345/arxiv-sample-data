We study infinite approximate subgroups of soluble Lie groups. Generalising a theorem of Fried and Goldman we show that approximate subgroups are close, in a sense to be defined, to genuine connected subgroups. Building up on this result we prove a structure theorem for approximate lattices in soluble Lie groups. This extends to soluble Lie groups a theorem about quasi-crystals due to Yves Meyer.
