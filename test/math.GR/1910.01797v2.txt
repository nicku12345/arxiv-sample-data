The space of directions is a notion of boundary associated to an arbitrary totally disconnected locally compact group. We explicitly calculate the space of directions of a group acting vertex transitively with compact open vertex stabilisers on a locally finite connected hyperbolic graph. These are examples of groups where techniques from geometric group theory can be generalised from the discrete to the non-discrete case. We show the space of directions for these groups is a discrete metric space. Our results resolve a conjecture of Baumgartner, M\"oller and Willis in the affirmative.
