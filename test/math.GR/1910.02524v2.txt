A subgroup H of a group G is said to be pronormal in G if H and H^g are conjugate in \langle H, H^g \rangle for every g \in G. In this paper we classify finite simple groups E_6(q) and {}^2E_6(q) in which all the subgroups of odd index are pronormal. Thus, we complete a classification of finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type in which all the subgroups of odd index are pronormal.
