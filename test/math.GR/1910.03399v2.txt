The class of multi-EGS groups is a generalisation of the well-known Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki (GGS-)groups. Here we classify branch multi-EGS groups with the congruence subgroup property and determine the profinite completion of all branch multi-EGS groups. Additionally our results show that branch multi-EGS groups are just infinite.
