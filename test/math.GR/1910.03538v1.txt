In the present paper we prove sandwich classification for the overgroups of the subsystem subgroup E(\Delta,R) of the Chevalley group G(\Phi,R) for the three types of pair (\Phi,\Delta) (the root system and its subsystem) such that the group G(\Delta,R) is (up to torus) a Levi subgroup of the parabolic subgroup with abelian unipotent radical. Namely we show that for any such an overgroup H there exists a unique pair of ideals \sigma of the ring R such that E(\Phi,\Delta,R,\sigma)\le H\le N_{G(\Phi,R)}(E(\Phi,\Delta,R,\sigma)).
