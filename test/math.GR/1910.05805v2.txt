Let \hat{F} be a free pro-p non-abelian group, and let \Delta be a commutative Noetherian complete local ring with a maximal ideal I such that \textrm{char}(\Delta/I)=p>0. In [Zu], Zubkov showed that when p\neq2, the pro-p congruence subgroup GL_{2}^{1}(\Delta)=\ker(GL_{2}(\Delta)\overset{\Delta\to\Delta/I}{\longrightarrow}GL_{2}(\Delta/I)) admits a pro-p identity, i.e., there exists an element 1\neq w\in\hat{F} that vanishes under any continuous homomorphism \hat{F}\to GL_{2}^{1}(\Delta).   In this paper we investigate the case p=2. The main result is that when \textrm{char}(\Delta)=2, the pro-2 group GL_{2}^{1}(\Delta) admits a pro-2 identity. This result was obtained by the use of trace identities that originate in PI-theory.
