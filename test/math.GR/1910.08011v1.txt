In the present paper we prove a weak form of sandwich classification for the overgroups of the subsystem subgroup E(\Delta,R) of the Chevalley group G(\Phi,R) where \Phi is a symply laced root sysetem and \Delta is its sufficiently large subsystem. Namely we show that for any such an overgroup H there exists a unique net of ideals \sigma of the ring R such that E(\Phi,\Delta,R,\sigma)\le H\le {\mathop{\mathrm{Stab}}\nolimits}_{G(\Phi,R)}(L(\sigma)) where E(\Phi,\Delta,R,\sigma) is an elementary subgroup associated with the net and L(\sigma) is a corresponding subalgebra of the Chevalley Lie algebra.
