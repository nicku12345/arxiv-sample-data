Let \Omega be a finite set and T(\Omega) be the full transformation monoid on \Omega. The rank of a transformation t\in T(\Omega) is the natural number |\Omega t|. Given A\subseteq T(\Omega), denote by \langle A\rangle the semigroup generated by A. Let k be a fixed natural number such that 2\le k\le |\Omega|. In the first part of this paper we (almost) classify the permutation groups G on \Omega such that for all rank k transformation t\in T(\Omega), every element in S_t:=\langle G,t\rangle can be written as a product eg, where e^2=e\in S_t and g\in G. In the second part we prove, among other results, that if S\le T(\Omega) and G is the normalizer of S in the symmetric group on \Omega, then the semigroup SG is regular if and only if S is regular. (Recall that a semigroup S is regular if for all s\in S there exists s'\in S such that s=ss's.) The paper ends with a list of problems.
