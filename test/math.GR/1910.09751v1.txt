For a unital ring S, an S-linear quasigroup is a unital S-module, with automorphisms \rho and \lambda giving a (nonassociative) multiplication x\cdot y=x^\rho+y^\lambda. If S is the field of complex numbers, then ordinary characters provide a complete linear isomorphism invariant for finite-dimensional S-linear quasigroups. Over other rings, it is an open problem to determine tractably computable isomorphism invariants. The paper investigates this isomorphism problem for \mathbb{Z}-linear quasigroups. We consider the extent to which ordinary characters classify \mathbb{Z}-linear quasigroups and their representations of the free group on two generators. We exhibit non-isomorphic \mathbb{Z}-linear quasigroups with the same ordinary character. For a subclass of \mathbb{Z}-linear quasigroups, equivalences of the corresponding ordinary representations are realized by permutational intertwinings. This leads to a new equivalence relation on \mathbb{Z}-linear quasigroups, namely permutational similarity. Like the earlier concept of central isotopy, permutational similarity is intermediate between isomorphism and isotopy.
