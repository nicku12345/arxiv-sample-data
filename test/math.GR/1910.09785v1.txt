A nonempty class \mathfrak{X} of finite groups is called complete if it is closed under taking subgroups, homomorphic images and extensions. We deal with a classical problem of determining \mathfrak{X}-maximal subgroups. We consider two definitions of submaximal \mathfrak{X}-subgroups suggested by Wielandt and discuss which one better suits our task. We prove that these definitions are not equivalent yet Wielandt-Hartley's theorem holds true for either definition of \mathfrak{X}-submaximality. We also give some applications of the strong version of Wielandt-Hartley's theorem.
