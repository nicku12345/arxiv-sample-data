For a finite group G, we denote by \omega(G) the number of \operatorname{Aut}(G)-orbits on G, and by \operatorname{o}(G) the number of distinct element orders in G. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the two quantities \mathfrak{d}(G):=\omega(G)-\operatorname{o}(G) and \mathfrak{q}(G):=\omega(G)/\operatorname{o}(G), each of which may be viewed as a measure for how far G is from being an AT-group in the sense of Zhang (that is, a group with \omega(G)=\operatorname{o}(G)). We show that the index |G:\operatorname{Rad}(G)| of the soluble radical \operatorname{Rad}(G) of G can be bounded from above both by a function in \mathfrak{d}(G) and by a function in \mathfrak{q}(G) and \operatorname{o}(\operatorname{Rad}(G)). We also obtain a curious quantitative characterisation of the Fischer-Griess Monster group \operatorname{M}.
