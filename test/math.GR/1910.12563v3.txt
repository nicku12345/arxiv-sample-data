Let G be a finite abelian group written additively with identity 0, and   \Omega be an inverse closed generating subset of G such that 0\notin \Omega. We say that  \Omega  has the property \lq\lq{}us\rq\rq{} (unique summation), whenever for every 0 \neq g\in G if there are s_1,s_2,s_3, s_4 \in \Omega  such that s_1+s_2=g=s_3+s_4 , then we have \{s_1,s_2 \} = \{s_3,s_4 \}. We say that a Cayley graph \Gamma=Cay(G;\Omega) is a us-Cayley\ graph, whenever \Gamma is an abelian Cayley graph and the generating subset \Omega has the property \lq\lq{}us\rq\rq{}. In this paper, we show that if \Gamma=Cay(G;\Omega) is a us-Cayley\ graph, then Aut(\Gamma)=L(G)\rtimes A, where L(G)=\{l_v | v \in G\},  l_v: V \rightarrow V,  l_v(x)=v+x fore every  x \in G , and A is the group of all automorphisms \theta  of the group G such that \theta(\Omega)=\Omega. Then, we explicitly determine the automorphism groups of some classes of graphs, including M\"{o}bius ladders and k-array n-cubes.
