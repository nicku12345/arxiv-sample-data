We define and study a pro-p version of Sidki's weak commutativity construction. This is the pro-p group \mathfrak{X}_p(G) generated by two copies G and G^{\psi} of a pro-p group, subject to the defining relators [g,g^{\psi}] for all g \in G. We show for instance that if G is finitely presented or analytic pro-p, then \mathfrak{X}_p(G) has the same property. Furthermore we study properties of the non-abelian tensor product and the pro-p version of Rocco's construction \nu(H). We also study finiteness properties of subdirect products of pro-p groups. In particular we prove a pro-p version of the (n-1)-n-(n+1) Theorem.
