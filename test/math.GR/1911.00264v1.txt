In this paper we present some algebraic properties of subgroupoids and normal subgroupoids. We define the normalizer of a wide subgroupoid \mathcal{H} and show that, as in the case of groups, the normalizer is the greatest wide subgroupoid of the groupoid \mathcal{G} in which \mathcal{H} is normal. Furthermore, we give the definition of center and commutator and prove that both are normal subgroupoids, the first one of the union of all the isotropy groups of \mathcal{G} and the second one of \mathcal{G}. Finally, we introduce the concept of inner isomorphism of \mathcal{G} and show that the set of all the inner isomorphisms of \mathcal{G} is a normal subgroupoid, which is isomorphic to the quotient groupoid of \mathcal{G} by its center \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{G}), which extends to groupoids a well-known result in groups.
