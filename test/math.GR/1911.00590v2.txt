We study two classes of inverse semigroups built from directed graphs, namely graph inverse semigroups and a new class of semigroups that we refer to as Leavitt inverse semigroups. These semigroups are closely related to graph C^*-algebras and Leavitt path algebras. We provide a topological characterization of the universal groups of the local submonoids of these inverse semigroups. We study the relationship between the graph inverse semigroups of two graphs when there is a directed immersion between the graphs. We describe the structure of graphs that admit a directed cover or directed immersion into a circle and we provide structural information about graph inverse semigroups of finite graphs that admit a directed cover onto a bouquet of circles. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for a homomorphic image of a graph inverse semigroup to be another graph inverse semigroup. We find a presentation for the Leavitt inverse semigroup of a graph in terms of generators and relations. We describe the structure of the Leavitt inverse semigroup and the Leavitt path algebra of a graph that admits a directed immersion into a circle. We show that two graphs that have isomorphic Leavitt inverse semigroups have isomorphic Leavitt path algebras and we classify graphs that have isomorphic Leavitt inverse semigroups. As a consequence, we show that Leavitt path algebras are 0-retracts of certain matrix algebras.
