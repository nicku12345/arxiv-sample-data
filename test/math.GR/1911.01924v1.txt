Let S be a class of groups and let f_S (n) be the number of isomorphism classes of groups in S of order n. Let f(n) count the number of groups of order n up to isomorphism. The asymptotic bounds for f(n) behave differently when restricted to abelian groups, A-groups and groups in general. We survey some results and some open questions in enumeration of finite groups with a focus on enumerating within varieties of A-groups.
