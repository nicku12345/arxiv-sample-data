In this paper we introduce the definition of (k,l)-universal transversal property, which is a refinement of the definition of k-universal transversal property, which in turn is a refinement of the classic definition of k-homogeneity for permutation groups. In particular, a group possesses the (2,n)-universal transversal property if and only if it is primitive; it possesses the (2,2)-universal transversal property if and only if it is 2-homogeneous. Up to a few undecided cases, we give a classification of groups satisfying the (k,l)-universal transversal property, for k\ge 3. Then we apply this result for studying regular semigroups of partial transformations.
