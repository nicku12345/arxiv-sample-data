Given a finite simplicial graph \Gamma=(V,E) with a vertex-labelling \varphi:V\rightarrow\left\{\text{non-trivial finitely generated groups}\right\}, the graph product G_\Gamma is the free product of the vertex groups \varphi(v) with added relations that imply elements of adjacent vertex groups commute. For a quasi-isometric invariant \mathcal{P}, we are interested in understanding under which combinatorial conditions on the graph \Gamma the graph product G_\Gamma has property \mathcal{P}. In this article our emphasis is on number of ends of a graph product G_\Gamma. In particular, we obtain a complete characterization of number of ends of a graph product of finitely generated groups.
