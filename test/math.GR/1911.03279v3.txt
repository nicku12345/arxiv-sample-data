A group is said to be capable if it is the central factor of some group. In this paper, among other results we have characterized capable groups of order p^2q, for any distinct primes p, q, which extends Theorem 1.2 of S. Rashid, N. H. Sarmin, A. Erfanian, and N. M. Mohd Ali, {\em On the non abelian tensor square and capability of groups of order p^2q}, Arch. Math., \textbf{97} (2011), 299--306. We have also computed the number of distinct element centralizers of a group (finite or infinite) with central factor of order p^3, which extends Proposition 2.10 of S. M. Jafarian Amiri, H. Madadi and H. Rostami, {\em On F-groups with the central factor of order p^4}, Math. Slovaca, \textbf{67} (5) (2017), 1147--1154.
