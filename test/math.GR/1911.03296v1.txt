Given a sublinear function \kappa, the \kappa-Morse boundary \partial_\kappa G of a CAT(0) group was introduced by Qing and Rafi and shown to be a quasi-isometry invariant and a metrizable space.   In this paper, we prove several properties of the \kappa-Morse boundary that further generalize useful properties of the Gromov boundary. We first show that if X is a proper CAT(0) space, then   \partial_\kappa X is a strong visibility space. We also show that any CAT(0) group G with nonempty \kappa-boundary contains a rank one isometry; furthermore, the subspace consisting of strongly contracting rays is a dense subspace of \partial_\kappa G. These results generate several applications: any CAT(0) group with nonempty \kappa-Morse boundary is an acylindrically hyperbolic group; the collection of rank one isometries G contains is exponentially generic. Furthermore, we show that a homeomorphism f: \partial_\kappa G \to \partial_\kappa G' comes from a quasi-isometry if and only if f is Morse quasi-m\"obius and stable. Lastly, we characterize exactly when the sublinearly Morse boundary is a compact space.
