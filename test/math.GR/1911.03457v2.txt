We construct new examples of groups with cohomological dimension 2 and geometric dimension 3 with respect to the families of finite subgroups, virtually abelian groups of bounded rank, and the family of virtually poly-cyclic subgroups. Our main ingredients are the examples constructed by Brady-Leary-Nucinckis and Fluch-Leary, and Bass-Serre theory.
