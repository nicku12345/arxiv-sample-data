This research develops concepts surrounding centralizer-like subgroups associated with the n-Engel word in relation to direct product groups. Specifically, characteristics of the set of right n-Engel elements inside of direct products are explored. A proof is given demonstrating that the set of right n-Engel elements inside of the direct product of two groups is equivalent to the direct product of the set of right n-Engel elements inside of one of the groups with the set of right n-Engel elements inside of the other group. Additionally, a proof detailing a proposition from another paper written by Luise-Charlotte Kappe and Patrick Ratchford in relation to direct products follows. Further questions are explored and future questions are proposed.
