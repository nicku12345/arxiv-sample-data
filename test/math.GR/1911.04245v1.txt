New results on metric ultraproducts of finite simple groups are established. We show that the isomorphism type of a simple metric ultraproduct of groups X_{n_i}(q) (i\in I) for X\in\{{\rm PGL},{\rm PSp},{\rm PGO}^{(\varepsilon)},{\rm PGU}\} (\varepsilon=\pm) along an ultrafilter \mathcal{U} on the index set I for which n_i\to_{\mathcal{U}}\infty determines the type X and the field size q up to the possible isomorphism of a metric ultraproduct of groups {\rm PSp}_{n_i}(q) and a metric ultraproduct of groups {\rm PGO}_{n_i}^{(\varepsilon)}(q). This extends results of Thom and Wilson.
