We prove the Tits-Weiss conjecture for Albert division algebras over fields of arbitrary characteristics in the affirmative. The conjecture predicts that every norm similarity of an Albert division algebra is a product of a scalar homothety and U-operators. This conjecture is equivalent to the Kneser-Tits conjecture for simple, simply connected algebraic groups with Tits index E^{78}_{8,2}. We prove that a simple, simply connected algebraic group with Tits index E_{8,2}^{78} or E_{7,1}^{78}, defined over a field of arbitrary characteristic, is R-trivial, in the sense of Manin, thereby proving the Kneser-Tits conjecture for such groups. The Tits-Weiss conjecture follows as a consequence.
