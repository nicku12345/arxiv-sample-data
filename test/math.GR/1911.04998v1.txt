Let p>q be odd primes. We classify Bol loops and Bruck loops of order pq up to isotopism. When q does not divide p^2-1, the only Bol loop (and hence the only Bruck loop) of order pq is the cyclic group of order pq. When q divides p^2-1, there are precisely \lfloor(p-1+4q)(2q)^{-1}\rfloor Bol loops of order pq up to isotopism, including a unique nonassociative Bruck loop of order pq.
