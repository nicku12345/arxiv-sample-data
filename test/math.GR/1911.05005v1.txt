There is a one-to-one correspondence between involutory latin quandles and uniquely 2-divisible Bruck loops. Bruck loops of odd prime power order are centrally nilpotent. Using linear-algebraic approach to central extensions, we enumerate Bruck loops (and hence involutory latin quandles) of order 3^k for k\le 5, except for those loops that are central extensions of the cyclic group of order 3 by the elementary abelian group of order 3^4.   Among the constructed loops there is a Bruck loop of order 3^5 whose associated \Gamma-loop is not a commutative automorphic loop. We independently enumerate commutative automorphic loops of order 3^k for k\le 5, with the same omission as in the case of Bruck loops.
