In a semigroup S with fixed c\in S, one can construct a new semigroup (S,\cdot_c) called a \emph{variant} by defining x\cdot_c y:=xcy. Elements a,b\in S are \emph{primarily conjugate} if there exist x,y\in S^1 such that a=xy, b=yx. This coincides with the usual conjugacy in groups, but is not transitive in general semigroups. Ara\'{u}jo \emph{et al.} proved that transitivity holds in a variety \mathcal{W} of epigroups containing all completely regular semigroups and their variants, and asked if transitivity holds for all variants of semigroups in \mathcal{W}. We answer this affirmatively as part of a study of varieties and variants of epigroups.
