Let G and A be finite groups with A acting on G by automorphisms. In this paper we introduce the concept of "good action"; namely we say the action of A on G is good, if H=[H,B]C_H(B) for every subgroup B of A and every B-invariant subgroup H of G. This definition allows us to prove a new noncoprime Hall-Higman type theorem.   If A is a nilpotent group acting on the finite solvable group G with C_G(A)=1, a long standing conjecture states that h(G)\leq \ell(A) where h(G) is the Fitting height of G and \ell(A) is the number of primes dividing the order of A counted with multiplicities. As an application of our result we prove the main theorem of this paper which states that the above conjecture is true if A and G have odd order, the action of A on G is good and some other fairly general conditions are satisfied.
