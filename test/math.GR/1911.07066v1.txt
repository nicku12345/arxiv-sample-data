We give here the exact maximal subgroup growth of two classes of polycyclic groups. Let G_k = \langle x_1, x_2, ..., x_k \mid x_ix_jx_i^{-1}x_j \text{ for all } i < j \rangle. So G_k = \mathbb{Z} \rtimes (\mathbb{Z} \rtimes (\mathbb{Z} \rtimes ... \rtimes \mathbb{Z}). Then for all k \geq 2, we calculate m_n(G_k), the number of maximal subgroups of G_k of index n, exactly. Also, for infinitely many groups H_k of the form \mathbb{Z}^2 \rtimes G_2, we calculate m_n(H_k) exactly.
