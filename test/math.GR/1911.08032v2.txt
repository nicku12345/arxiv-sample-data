We study the scale function, space of directions and scale-multiplicative semigroups for restricted Burger-Mozes groups. We relate these general notions to intrinsic properties of the group. Among other things, we give a formula for the scale function; relate the space of directions to both the action on the tree and an action on a \operatorname{CAT}(0) cube complex; and construct maximal scale-multiplicative semigroups from the space of directions.
