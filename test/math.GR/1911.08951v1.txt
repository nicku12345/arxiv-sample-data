This thesis aims to serve as an introduction to the theory of quasitilings for amenable groups. In order to showcase the power of this theory, we focus on the study of the Sofic L\"uck Approximation Conjecture, which can be proven for amenable groups by making use of quasitilings. The first four chapters of the thesis are an exposition of the aforementioned topics, collected from the literature. After that, in the fifth and final chapter we present some new results related to the Sofic L\"uck Approximation Conjecture for amenable groups over discrete valuation rings and number fields.
