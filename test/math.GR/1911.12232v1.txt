In 2008, Diaconis annd Isaacs introduced the notion of a supercharacter theory of a finite group in which supercharacters replace with irreducible characters and superclasses by conjugacy classes. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for constructing supercharacter theories of a finite group by which all supercharacter theories of groups containing up to 14 conjugacy classes are calculated.
