If a group G is \pi-separable, where \pi is a set of primes, the set of irreducible characters \operatorname{B}_{\pi}(G) \cup \operatorname{B}_{\pi'}(G) can be defined. In this paper, we prove that there are variants of some classical theorems in character theory, namely the Theorem of Ito-Michler and Thompson theorem on character degrees, which involve irreducible characters in the set \operatorname{B}_{\pi}(G) \cup \operatorname{B}_{\pi'}(G).
