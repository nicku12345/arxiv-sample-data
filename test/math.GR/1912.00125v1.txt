Let G be a group, define an equivalence relation \sim as below: \forall \ g, h \in G, \ g \sim h \Longleftrightarrow |g| = |h| the set of sizes of equivalence classes with respect to this relation is called the same-order type of G and denoted by \alpha(G). And G is said a \alpha_n-group if |\alpha(G)|=n. Let \pi(G) be the set of prime divisors of the order of G. A simple group of G is called a simple K_n-group if |\pi(G)|=n. We give a new characterization of simple K_3-groups using same-order type. Indeed we prove that a nonabelian simple group G has same-order type \{r, m, n, k, l\} if and only if G \cong PSL(2,q), with q=7, 8 or 9. This result generalizes the main results in \cite{KKA}, \cite{Sh} and \cite{TZ1}. Motived by the main result in \cite{TZ1} L. J. Taghvasani and M. Zarrin put the following Conjecture 2.10: \textit{Let S be a nonabelian simple \alpha_n-group and G a \alpha_n-group such that |S|=|G|. Then S \cong G}. In this paper with a counterexample we give a negative answer to this question.
