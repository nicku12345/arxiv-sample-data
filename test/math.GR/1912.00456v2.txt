In this paper, we study the product of orders of composition factors of odd order in a composition series of a finite linear group. First we generalize a result by Manz and Wolf about the order of solvable linear groups of odd order. Then we use this result to find bounds for the product of orders of composition factors of odd order in a composition series of a finite linear group.
