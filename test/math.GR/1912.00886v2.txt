A JSJ decomposition of a group is a splitting that allows one to classify all possible splittings of the group over a certain family of edge groups. Although JSJ decompositions are not unique in general, Guirardel--Levitt have constructed a canonical JSJ decomposition for splittings of relatively hyperbolic groups over elementary subgroups, which they have used to study the outer automorphism group. In this paper we provide a more strongly canonical JSJ tree for a relatively hyperbolic group (G,\mathbb{P}), which is determined by the homeomorphism type of the Bowditch boundary. This canonical JSJ tree is a quasi-isometry invariant of (G,\mathbb{P}) and admits a natural action by the quasi-isometry group of (G,\mathbb{P}).
