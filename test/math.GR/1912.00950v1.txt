We prove that the class of finitely presented inverse monoids whose Sch\"utzenberger graphs are quasi-isometric to trees has a uniformly solvable word problem, furthermore, the languages of their Sch\"utzenberger automata are context-free. On the other hand, we show that there is a finitely presented inverse monoid with hyperbolic Sch\"utzenberger graphs and an unsolvable word problem.
