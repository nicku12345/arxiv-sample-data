It is known that simple algebraic groups of type F_4 defined over a field k are precisely the full automorphism groups of Albert algebras over k. We explore R-triviality for the group \text{\bf Aut}(A) when A is an Albert algebra. In this paper, we consider the case when A is an Albert division algebra, that arises from the first Tits construction. We prove that \text{\bf Aut}(A) is R-trivial, in the sense of Manin.
