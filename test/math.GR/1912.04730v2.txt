A few years ago the so-called oriented subgroup \vec F of the Thompson group F was introduced by V. Jones while investigating the connections between subfactors and conformal field theories. In the coding of links and knots by elements of F it corresponds exactly to the oriented ones. Thanks to the work of Golan and Sapir, \vec F provided the first example of a maximal subgroup of infinite index in F different from the parabolic subgroups that fix a point in (0,1). In this paper we investigate possible analogues of \vec F in higher Thompson groups F_k, k\geq 2, with F=F_2, introduced by Brown. Most notably, we study algebraic properties of the oriented subgroup \vec{F}_3 of F_3, as described recently by Jones, and prove in particular that it gives rise to a non-parabolic maximal subgroup of infinite index in F_3 and that the corresponding quasi-regular representation is irreducible.
