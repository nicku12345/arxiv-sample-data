Let \mathcal{G} be a Kac-Moody group functor in the sense of Tits, with associated Coxeter system (W,S). For any field F, the group \mathcal{G}(F) is finitely generated iff F is finite. We are interested in the question when G = \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{F}_q) is finitely presented. If (W,S) is 2-spherical, it is well known that this is "almost always" the case. It is conjectured that G is never finitely presented if (W,S) is not 2-spherical (which means that there exist s,t \in S with |st| = \infty), which so far (to the best of our knowledge) has only been proved for the type \tilde{A_1}, and maybe also, though we don't know a reference for this, in the case where |st| = \infty for all s \neq t \in S. In this paper, we show that G is not finitely presented for a significantly larger class of Coxeter systems which are not 2-spherical, giving much stronger evidence that the conjecture is true in general. Important tools of the proof are the twin BN-pair and the corresponding twin building associated to G = \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{F}_q).
