A group G is called mixed identity-free if for every n \in \mathbb{N} and every w \in G \ast F_n there exists a homomorphism \varphi: G \ast F_n \rightarrow G such that \varphi is the identity on G and \varphi(w) is nontrivial. In this paper, we make a modification to the construction of elementary amenable lacunary hyperbolic groups given by Ol'shanskii, Osin, and Sapir to produce finitely generated elementary amenable groups which are mixed identity-free. As a byproduct of this construction, we also obtain locally finite p-groups which are mixed identity-free.
