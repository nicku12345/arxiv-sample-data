Given any group G, the multiple holomorph \mathrm{NHol}(G) is the normalizer of the holomorph \mathrm{Hol}(G) = \rho(G)\rtimes \mathrm{Aut}(G) in the group of all permutations of G, where \rho denotes the right regular representation. The quotient T(G) = \mathrm{NHol}(G)/\mathrm{Hol}G) has order a power of 2 in many of the known cases, but there are exceptions. We shall give a new method of constructing elements (of odd order) in T(G) when G=A\rtimes C_d, where A is a group of finite exponent coprime to d and C_d is the cyclic group of order d.
