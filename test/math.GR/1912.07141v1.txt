Fenyves BCI-algebras are BCI-algebras that satisfy the Bol-Moufang identities. In this paper, the holomorphy of BCI-algebras are studied. It is shown that whenever a loop and its holomorph are BCI-algebras, the former is p-semisimple if and only if the latter is p-semisimple. Whenever a loop and its holomorph are BCI-algebras, it is established that the former is a BCK-algebra if and only if the latter has a BCK-subalgebra. Moreover, the holomorphy of the associative and some non-associative Fenyves BCI-algebras are also studied.
