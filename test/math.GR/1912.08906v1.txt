In this paper we introduce the notion of a quasi-powerful p-group for odd primes p. These are the finite p-groups G such that G/Z(G) is powerful in the sense of Lubotzky and Mann. We show that this large family of groups shares many of the same properties as powerful p-groups. For example, we show that they have a regular power structure, and we generalise a result of Fern\'andez-Alcober on the order of commutators in powerful p-groups to this larger family of groups. We also obtain a bound on the number of generators of a subgroup of a quasi-powerful p-group, expressed in terms of the number of generators of the group. We give an infinite family of examples which demonstrates this bound is close to best possible.
