This paper is dedicated to the surjective stability of the K_1-functor for Chevalley groups for the embedding D_5 into E_6. This case was already studed by Plotkin. In the present paper, we improve his result by showing that surjective stability holds under a weaker assumption on a ring. Another result of the present paper shows how the K_1-stability can help to study overgroups of subsystem subgroups.
