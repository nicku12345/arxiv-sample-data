Given an automorphism \phi:G\to G of an infinite group G, one has the twisted conjugation action of G on itself given by g.x=gx\phi(g^{-1}). The orbits of this action are the \phi-twisted conjugacy classes. The Reidemeister number R(\phi) is the number of \phi-twisted conjugacy classes in G. One says that G has the R_\infty-property if R(\phi) is infinite for every automorphism of G. We show that the groups G=GL_n(R), SL_n(R) have the R_\infty-property when R=F[t] for n\ge 2, R= F[t,t^{-1}]  for  n\ge 3 where F is a subfield of \bar{\mathbb F}_p. We also show that GL_2(\mathbb F_q[t,t^{-1}]) has the R_\infty-property.
