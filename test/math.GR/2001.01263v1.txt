The structure of finite and locally finite groups in which every element has prime power order (CP-groups) is well known. In this paper we note that the combination of our earlier results with the available information on the structure of finite CP-groups yields a detailed description of profinite groups with that property. Then we deal with two generalizations of profinite CP-groups.   Theorem 1.2. A profinite group G is virtually pro-p for some prime p if and only if for each nontrivial x in G there is a prime p (depending on x) such that the centralizer of x is virtually pro-p.   Theorem 1.3. Let G be a profinite group in which each element has either finite or prime power (possibly infinite) order. Then G is either torsion or virtually pro-p for some prime p.
