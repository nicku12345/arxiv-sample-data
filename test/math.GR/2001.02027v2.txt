A group G is said to have property R_{\infty} if for every automorphism \varphi \in {\rm Aut}(G), the cardinality of the set of \varphi-twisted conjugacy classes is infinite. Many classes of groups are known to have such property. However, very few examples are known for which R_{\infty} is {\it geometric}, i.e., if G has property R_{\infty} then any group quasi-isometric to G also has property R_{\infty}. In this paper, we give examples of groups and conditions under which R_{\infty} is preserved under commensurability. The main tool is to employ the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant.
