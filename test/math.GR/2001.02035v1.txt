A primary covering of a finite group G is a family of proper subgroups of G whose union contains the set of elements of G having order a prime power. We denote with \sigma_0(G) the smallest size of a primary covering of G, and call it the primary covering number of G. We study this number and compare it with its analogous \sigma(G), the covering number, for the classes of groups G that are solvable and symmetric.
