Let \phi:G\to G be an automorphism of a group which is a free-product of finitely many groups each of which is freely indecomposable and two of the factors contain proper finite index characteristic subgroups. We show that G has infinitely many \phi-twisted conjugacy classes. As an application, we show that if G is the fundamental group of a three-manifold that is not irreducible, then G has property R_\infty, that is, there are infinitely many \phi-twisted conjugacy classes in G for every automorphism \phi of G.
