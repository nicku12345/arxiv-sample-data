We construct a family of infinite simple groups that we call \emph{twisted Brin-Thompson groups}, generalizing Brin's higher-dimensional Thompson groups sV (s\in\mathbb{N}). We use twisted Brin-Thompson groups to prove a variety of results regarding simple groups. For example, we prove that every finitely generated group embeds quasi-isometrically as a subgroup of a two-generated simple group, strengthening a result of Bridson. We also produce examples of simple groups that contain every sV and hence every right-angled Artin group, including examples of type \textrm{F}_\infty and a family of examples of type \textrm{F}_{n-1} but not of type \textrm{F}_n, for arbitrary n\in\mathbb{N}. This provides the second known infinite family of simple groups distinguished by their finiteness properties.
