We study the minimally displaced set of irreducible automorphisms of a free group. Our main result is the co-compactness of the minimally displaced set of an irreducible automorphism with exponential growth \phi, under the action of the centraliser C(\phi). As a corollary, we get that the same holds for the action of <\phi> on Min(\phi). Finally, we prove that the minimally displaced set of an irreducible automorphism of growth rate one is consisted of a single point.
