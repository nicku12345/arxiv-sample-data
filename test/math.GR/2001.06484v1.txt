A subset \{g_1, \ldots , g_d\} of a finite group G invariably generates G if the set \{g_1^{x_1}, \ldots, g_d^{x_d}\} generates G for every choice of x_i \in G. The Chebotarev invariant C(G) of G is the expected value of the random variable n that is minimal subject to the requirement that n randomly chosen elements of G invariably generate G. The first author recently showed that C(G)\le \beta\sqrt{|G|} for some absolute constant \beta. In this paper we show that, when G is soluble, then \beta is at most 5/3. We also show that this is best possible. Furthermore, we show that, in general, for each \epsilon>0 there exists a constant c_{\epsilon} such that C(G)\le (1+\epsilon)\sqrt{|G|}+c_{\epsilon}.
