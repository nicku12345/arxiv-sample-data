A Cayley-sudoku table of a finite group G is a Cayley table for G, the body of which is partitioned into uniformly sized rectangular blocks in such a way that each group element appears exactly once in each block. A Cayley-sudoku table is pandiagonal magic provided the blocks are square and the "sum" (using the group operation) of elements in every row, column, broken diagonal, and broken antidiagonal in each block gives the group identity. We provide sufficient conditions for a group to have a pandiagonal magic Cayley-sudoku table and give some examples.
