Let G be a finite group and let \psi(G) denote the sum of element orders of G. It is well-known that the maximum value of \varphi on the set of groups of order n, where n is a positive integer, will occur at the cyclic group C_n. For nilpotent groups, we prove a natural generalization of this result, obtained by replacing the element orders of G with the element orders relative to a certain subgroup H of G.
