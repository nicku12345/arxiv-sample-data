A code algebra A_C is a nonassociative commutative algebra defined via a binary linear code C. In a previous paper, we classified when code algebras are \mathbb{Z}_2-graded axial (decomposition) algebras generated by small idempotents. In this paper, for each algebra in our classification, we obtain the Miyamoto group associated to the grading. We also show that the code algebra structure can be recovered from the axial decomposition algebra structure.
