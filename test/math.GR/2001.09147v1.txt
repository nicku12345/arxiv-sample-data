Let G be a finite group and \sigma a partition of the set of all? primes \Bbb{P}, that is, \sigma =\{\sigma_i \mid i\in I \}, where \Bbb{P}=\bigcup_{i\in I} \sigma_i and \sigma_i\cap \sigma_j= \emptyset  for all i\ne j. If n is an integer, we write \sigma(n)=\{\sigma_i \mid \sigma_{i}\cap \pi (n)\ne \emptyset \} and \sigma (G)=\sigma (|G|). We call a graph \Gamma with the set of all vertices V(\Gamma)=\sigma (G) (G\ne 1) a \sigma-arithmetic graph of G, and we associate with G\ne 1 the following three directed \sigma-arithmetic graphs: (1) the \sigma-Hawkes graph \Gamma_{H\sigma }(G) of G is a \sigma-arithmetic graph of G in which (\sigma_i, \sigma_j)\in E(\Gamma_{H\sigma }(G)) if \sigma_j\in \sigma (G/F_{\{\sigma_i\}}(G)); (2) the \sigma-Hall graph \Gamma_{\sigma Hal}(G) of G in which (\sigma_i, \sigma_j)\in E(\Gamma_{\sigma Hal}(G)) if for some Hall \sigma_i-subgroup H of G we have \sigma_j\in \sigma (N_{G}(H)/HC_{G}(H)); (3) the \sigma-Vasil'ev-Murashko graph \Gamma_{{\mathfrak{N}_\sigma }}(G) of G in which (\sigma_i, \sigma_j)\in E(\Gamma_{{\mathfrak{N}_\sigma}}(G)) if for some {\mathfrak{N}_{\sigma }}-critical subgroup H of G we have \sigma_i \in \sigma (H) and \sigma_j\in \sigma (H/F_{\{\sigma_i\}}(H)). In this paper, we study the structure of G depending on the properties of these three graphs of G.
