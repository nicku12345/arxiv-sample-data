We introduce the concept of propagating equations and focus on the case of associativity propagating in varieties of loops.   An equation \varepsilon propagates in an algebra X if \varepsilon(\overrightarrow y) holds whenever \varepsilon(\overrightarrow x) holds and the elements of \overrightarrow y are contained in the subalgebra of X generated by \overrightarrow x. If \varepsilon propagates in X then it propagates in all subalgebras and products of X but not necessarily in all homomorphic images of X. If \mathcal V is a variety, the propagating core \mathcal V_{[\varepsilon]} = \{X\in\mathcal V:\varepsilon propagates in X\} is a quasivariety but not necessarily a variety.   We prove by elementary means Goursat's Lemma for loops and describe all subdirect products of X^k and all finitely generated loops in \mathbf{HSP}(X) for a nonabelian simple loop X. If \mathcal V is a variety of loops in which associativity propagates, X is a finite loop in which associativity propagates and every subloop of X is either nonabelian simple or contained in \mathcal V, then associativity propagates in \mathbf{HSP}(X)\lor\mathcal V.   We study the propagating core \mathcal S_{[x(yz)=(xy)z]} of Steiner loops with respect to associativity. While this is not a variety, we exhibit many varieties contained in \mathcal S_{[x(yz)=(xy)z]}, each providing a solution to Rajah's problem, i.e., a variety of loops not contained in Moufang loops in which Moufang Theorem holds.
