We prove that the Bredon cohomological dimension and the virtual cohomological dimension coincide for groups that admit a cocompact model for \underline{E}G and satisfy properties (M) and (NM). Among the examples of groups satisfying these hypothesis are cocompact and arithmetic Fuchsian groups, one relator groups, the Hilbert modular group and 3-manifold groups.
