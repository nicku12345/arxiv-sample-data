An abstract group G is called totally 2-closed if H = H^{(2),\Omega} for any set \Omega with G\cong H\leq\textrm{Sym}_\Omega, where H^{(2),\Omega} is the largest subgroup of symmetric group of \Omega whose orbits on \Omega\times\Omega are the same orbits of H. In this paper, we prove that the Fitting subgroup of a totally 2-closed group is a totally 2-closed group. We also conjecture that a finite group G is totally 2-closed if and only if it is cyclic or a direct product of a cyclic group of odd order with a generalized quaternion group. We prove the conjecture in the soluble case, and reduce the general case to groups G of shape Z\cdot X, with Z = Z(G) cyclic, and X is a finite group with a unique minimal normal subgroup, which is nonabelian
