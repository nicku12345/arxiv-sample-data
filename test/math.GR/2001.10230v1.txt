The commutator length cl_G(g) of an element g \in [G,G] in the commutator subgroup of a group G is the least number of commutators needed to express g as their product.   If G is a non-abelian free groups, then given an integer n \in \mathbb{N} and an element g \in [G,G] the decision problem which determines if cl_G(g) \leq n is NP-complete. Thus, unless P=NP, there is no algorithm that computes cl_G(g) in polynomial time in terms of |g|, the wordlength of g. This statement remains true for groups which have a retract to a non-abelian free group, such as non-abelian right-angled Artin groups.   We will show these statements by relating commutator length to the \emph{cyclic block interchange distance} of words, which we also show to be NP-complete.
