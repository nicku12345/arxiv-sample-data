Given a global exponent E for a black box group \mathsf{Y} encrypting {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{F}), where \mathbb{F} is an unknown finite field of unknown odd characteristic, we construct, in probabilistic time polynomial in \log E, the isomorphisms \[ \mathsf{Y} \longleftrightarrow {\rm SL}_2(\mathsf{K}), \] where \mathsf{K} is a black box field encrypting \mathbb{F}. Our algorithm makes no reference to any additional oracles. We also give similar algorithms for black box groups encrypting {\rm PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}), {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}).
