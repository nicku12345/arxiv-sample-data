Let C(G) be the poset of cyclic subgroups of a finite group G and let \mathcal{P} be the class of p-groups of order p^n (n\geq 3). Consider the function \alpha:\mathcal{P}\longrightarrow (0, 1] given by \alpha(G)=\frac{|C(G)|}{|G|}. In this paper, we determine the second minimum value of \alpha, as well as the corresponding minimum points. Further, since the problem of finding the second maximum value of \alpha was completely solved for p=2, we focus on the case of odd primes and we outline a result in this regard.
