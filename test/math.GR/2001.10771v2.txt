Let m\leq n\in \mathbb{N}, and G\leq S_m and H\leq S_n. In this article we find conditions enabling embeddings between the symmetric R. Thompson groups V_m(G) and V_n(H). When n\equiv 1 \mod(m-1) and under some other technical conditions we find an embedding of V_n(H) in V_m(G) via topological conjugation. With the same modular condition we also generalise a purely algebraic construction of Birget from 2019 to find a group H\leq S_m and an embedding of V_m(G) in V_n(H).
