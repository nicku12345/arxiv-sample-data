G.E. Wall gave two different proofs of a remarkable result about the multilinear Lie relators satisfied by groups of prime power exponent q. He showed that if q is a power of the prime p, and if f is a multilinear Lie relator in n variables where n\neq1\operatorname{mod}(p-1), then f=0 is a consequence of multilinear Lie relators in fewer than n variables. For years I have struggled to understand his proofs, and while I still have not the slightest clue about his first proof published in the Journal of Algebra, I finally have some understanding of his second proof published in a conference proceedings. In this note I offer my insights into Wall's second proof of this theorem.
