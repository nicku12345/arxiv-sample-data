This part is made of three sections. In the first section we study the family of polynomials whose roots are 4cos2 k{\pi}, (n \geqslant 3,1 \leqslant k < \frac{n}{2}). We obtain n2 in this manner a family of orthogonal polynomials. This will permit us to study in details all the examples which follow. In the second section, we give technical formulae in order noto repeat calculations. In the third section,we give applications, first when the field K is a sub-field of R (presentations of W(H3) and W(H4)) then in the complex case (study of the complex reflection group G(p, p, n), G24 and G27).
