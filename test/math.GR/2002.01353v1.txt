Let \Gamma be a finite simple graph. If for some integer n\geqslant 4, \Gamma is a K_n-free graph whose complement has an odd cycle of length at least 2n-5, then we say that \Gamma is an n-exact graph. For a finite group G, let \Delta(G) denote the character graph built on the set of degrees of the irreducible complex characters of G. In this paper, we prove that the order of an n-exact character graph is at most 2n-1. Also we determine the structure of all finite groups G with extremal n-exact character graph \Delta(G).
