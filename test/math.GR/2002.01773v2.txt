A well-known theorem of Gustafson states that in a non-Abelian group the degree of satisfiability of xy=yx, i.e. the probability that two uniformly randomly chosen group elements x,y obey the equation xy=yx, is no larger than \frac{5}{8}. The seminal work of Antolin, Martino and Ventura (arXiv:1511.07269) on generalizing the degree of satisfiability to finitely generated groups led to renewed interest in Gustafson-style properties of other equations. Positive results have recently been obtained for the 2-Engel and metabelian identities (arXiv:1809.02997). Here we show that the degree of satisfiability of the equations xy^2=y^2x, xy^3=y^3x and xy=yx^{-1} is either 1, or no larger than 1-\varepsilon for some positive constant \varepsilon. Using the Antolin-Martino-Ventura formalism, we introduce criteria to identify which equations hold in a finite index subgroup precisely if they have positive degree of satisfiability. We deduce that the equations xy=yx^{-1} and xy^2=y^2x do not have this property.
