We study systematically groups whose marked finite quotients form a recursive set. We give several definitions, and prove basic properties of this class of groups, and in particular emphasize the link between the growth of the depth function and solvability of the word problem. We give examples of infinitely presented groups whose finite quotients can be effectively enumerated. Finally, our main result is that a residually finite group can be even not recursively presented and still have computable finite quotients, and that, on the other hand, it can have solvable word problem while still not having computable finite quotients.
