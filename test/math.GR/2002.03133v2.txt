The aim of our paper is to generalize the tangent prolongation of Lie groups to non-associative multiplications and to examine how the weak associative and weak inverse properties are transferred to the multiplication defined on the tangent bundle. We obtain that the tangent prolongation of a \mathcal{C}^r-differentiable loop (r\geq 1) is a \mathcal{C}^{r-1}-differentiable loop that acquires the classical weak inverse and weak associative properties of the initial loop.
