In this third part, we make the following hypothesis: representation R=R(\alpha,\beta,\gamma ;l) of W(p,q,r) is reducible and there exist a G-invariant non-nulle bilinear form where G=Im R. With those conditions, we know the structure of G: G'=G/N(G) is isomorphic to a finite dihedral group and N(G) is given explicitly as well as the action of G on N(G). We begin by giving conditions on p,q,r as well on \alpha,\beta,\gamma and we proove them in the appendix. The general case will be studied in the next part.
