We prove that the power word problem for the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups \mathsf{BS}(1,q) = \langle a,t \mid t a t^{-1} = a^q \rangle can be solved in \mathsf{TC}^0. In the power word problem, the input consists of group elements g_1, \ldots, g_d and binary encoded integers n_1, \ldots, n_d and it is asked whether g_1^{n_1} \cdots g_d^{n_d} = 1 holds. Moreover, we prove that the knapsack problem for \mathsf{BS}(1,q) is \mathsf{NP}-complete. In the knapsack problem, the input consists of group elements g_1, \ldots, g_d,h and it is asked whether the equation g_1^{x_1} \cdots g_d^{x_d} = h has a solution in \mathbb{N}^d.
