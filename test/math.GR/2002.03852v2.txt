For a finite group G, let \Delta(G) denote the character graph built on the set of degrees of the irreducible complex characters of G. Akhlaghi and Tong-Viet in \cite{[AT]} conjectured that if for some positive integer n, \Delta(G) is K_n-free, then \Delta(G) has at most 2n-1 vertices. In this paper, we present an example to show that this conjecture is not necessarily true for all non-solvable groups whose character graphs are K_n-free.
