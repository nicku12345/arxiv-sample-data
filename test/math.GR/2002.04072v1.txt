For a semigroup S, the covering number of S with respect to semigroups, \sigma_s(S), is the minimum number of proper subsemigroups of S whose union is S. This article investigates covering numbers of semigroups and analogously defined covering numbers of inverse semigroups and monoids. Our three main theorems give a complete description of the covering number of finite semigroups, finite inverse semigroups, and monoids (modulo groups and infinite semigroups). For a finite semigroup that is neither monogenic nor a group, its covering number is two. For all n\geq 2, there exists an inverse semigroup with covering number n, similar to the case of loops. Finally, a monoid that is neither a group nor a semigroup with an identity adjoined has covering number two as well.
