Let \Bbb P be the set of all primes. A subgroup H of a group G is called {\it \mathbb P-subnormal} in G, if either H=G, or there exists a chain of subgroups H=H_0\le H_1\le \ldots \le H_n=G, \ |H_{i}:H_{i-1}|\in \Bbb P, \ \forall i. A group G is called {\it widely supersoluble}, \mathrm{w}-supersoluble for short, if every Sylow subgroup of G is \mathbb P-subnormal in G. A group G=AB with \mathbb P-subnormal \mathrm{w}-supersoluble subgroups A and B is studied. The structure of its \mathrm{w}-supersoluble residual is obtained. In particular, it coincides with the nilpotent residual of the \mathcal{A}-residual of G. Here \mathcal{A} is the formation of all groups with abelian Sylow subgroups. Besides, we obtain new sufficient conditions for the \mathrm{w}-supersolubility of such group G.
