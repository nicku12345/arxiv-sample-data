Let G be a complex algebraic group defined over \mathbb R, which is not necessarily Zariski connected. In this article, we study the density of the images of the power maps g\to g^k, k\in\mathbb N, on real points of G, i.e., G(\mathbb R) equipped with the real topology. As a result, we extend a theorem of P. Chatterjee (\cite{Ch1}) on surjectivity of the power map for the set of semisimple elements of G(\mathbb R). We also characterize surjectivity of the power map for a disconnected group G(\mathbb R). The results are applied in particular to describe the image of the exponential map of G(\mathbb R).
