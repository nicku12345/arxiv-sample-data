A bijection f of a loop L is a half-automorphism if f(xy)\in \{f(x)f(y),f(y)f(x)\}, for any x,y\in L. A half-automorphism is nontrivial when it is neither an automorphism nor an anti-automorphism. A Chein loop L=G\cup Gu is a Moufang loop constructed from a group G and an element u of order 2 outside of G. In this paper, the half-automorphism group of finite Chein loops is described.
