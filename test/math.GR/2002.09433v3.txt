For a countable group G = <A | R> presented by its generators A and defining relations R we discuss a simple method to embed G into such a 2-generator group T that the images of generators from A are explicitly given in T, and the defining relations for T can automatically be deduced from the relations R. The obtained method is applied on particular examples of groups, and references of its application for embeddings of recursive groups into finitely presented groups are given.
