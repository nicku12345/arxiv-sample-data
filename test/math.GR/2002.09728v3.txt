In the context of Higman embeddings of recursive groups into finitely presented groups we suggest an algorithm which uses Higman operations to explicitly constructs the specific recursively enumerable sets of integer sequences arising during the embeddings. This makes the constructive Higman embedding a doable task for certain wide classes of groups. Specific auxiliary operations are introduced to make the work with Higman operations a simpler and more intuitive procedure. Also, an automated mechanism of constructive embeddings of countable groups into 2-generator groups is mentioned.
