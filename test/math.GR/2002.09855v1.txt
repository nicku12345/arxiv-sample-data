Supercharacter theory is developed by P. Diaconis and I. M. Isaacs as a natural generalization of the classical ordinary character theory. Some classical sums of number theory appear as supercharacters which are obtained by the action of certain subgroups of GLd(Zn) on Zdn. In this paper we take Zdp , p prime, and by the action of certain subgroups of GLd(Zp) we find supercharacter table of Zdp .
