We extend Burger-Mozes theory of closed, non-discrete, locally quasiprimitive automorphism groups of locally finite, connected graphs to the semiprimitive case, and develop a generalization of Burger-Mozes universal groups acting on the regular tree T_{d} of degree d. Three applications are given: First, we characterize the automorphism types which the quasi-center of a non-discrete subgroup of \mathrm{Aut}(T_{d}) may feature in terms of the group's local action. In doing so, we explicitly construct closed, non-discrete, compactly generated subgroups of \mathrm{Aut}(T_{d}) with non-trivial quasi-center, and see that Burger-Mozes theory does not extend beyond the semiprimitive case to the transitive case. We then characterize the k-closures of locally transitive subgroups of \mathrm{Aut}(T_{d}) containing an involutive inversion, and thereby partially answer two questions by Banks-Elder-Willis. Finally, we offer a new view on the Weiss conjecture.
