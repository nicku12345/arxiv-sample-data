In this fourth part, (with the notations of the preceding parts) we make the following hypothesis: (W,S) is a Coxeter system, irreducible, 2-spherical and S is finite. Let R:W\to GL(M) be a reducible reflection representation of W. Let G:= Im\,R. Each sub-space of M (\neq M) stabilize by G is contained in C_{M}(G). Let M':=M/C_{M}(G) and N(G):=\{g|g\in G,g\, \text{acts trivially on}\,M'. We call N(G) the translation sub-group of G. One of the goals of this part is to study M' and N(G).
