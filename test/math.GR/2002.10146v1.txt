Let G be a finite non-abelian group and {\Gamma}_{nc}(G) be its non-commuting graph. In this paper, we compute spectrum and energy of {\Gamma}_{nc}(G) for certain classes of finite groups. As a consequence of our results we construct infinite families of integral complete r-partite graphs. We compare energy and Laplacian energy (denoted by E({\Gamma}_{nc}(G)) and LE({\Gamma}_{nc}(G)) respectively) of {\Gamma}_{nc}(G) and conclude that E({\Gamma}_{nc}(G)) \leq LE({\Gamma}_{nc}(G)) for those groups except for some non-abelian groups of order pq. This shows that the conjecture posed in [Gutman, I., Abreu, N. M. M., Vinagre, C. T.M., Bonifacioa, A. S and Radenkovic, S. Relation between energy and Laplacian energy, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem., 59: 343--354, (2008)] does not hold for non-commuting graphs of certain finite groups, which also produces new families of counter examples to the above mentioned conjecture.
