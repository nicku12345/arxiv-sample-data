We study a class of quasimorphisms of the free group that can be expressed as infinite sums of Brooks quasimorphisms with some nice properties. We then review Heuer's framework of decompositions developed in arXiv:1710.03193, and put these quasimorphisms in that context. This allows us to prove triviality of a number of cup products in the bounded cohomology of the free group with trivial real coefficients. Finally, we introduce free products of decompositions and relate them to Rolli's quasimorphisms of free products. A technical result concerning these, which remains an open question, implies a strong triviality result for the cup product.
