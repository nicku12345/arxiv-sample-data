A well-known conjecture of Babai states that if G is a finite simple group and X is a generating set of G, then the diameter of the Cayley graph Cay(G,X) is bounded above by (\log |G|)^c for some absolute constant c. The goal of this paper is to prove such a bound for the diameter of Cay(G,X) whenever G=SL(n,p) and X is a generating set of G which contains a transvection. A natural analogue of this result is also proved for G=SL(n,K), where K can be any field.
