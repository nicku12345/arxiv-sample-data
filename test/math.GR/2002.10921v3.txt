Let \mathbb{M} be the monster group which is the largest sporadic finite simple group, and has first been constructed in 1982 by Griess. In 1985, Conway has constructed a 196884-dimensional representation \rho of \mathbb{M} with matrix coefficients in \mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]. So these matrices may be reduced modulo any (not necessarily prime) odd number p, leading to representations of \mathbb{M} in odd characteristic. The representation \rho is based on representations of two maximal subgroups G_{x0} and N_0 of \mathbb{M}. In ATLAS notation, G_{x0} has structure 2_+^{1+24}.\mbox{Co}_1 and N_0 has structure 2^{2+11+22}.( M_{24} \times S_3). Conway has constructed an explicit set of generators of N_0, but not of G_{x0}.   This paper is essentially a rewrite of Conway's construction augmented by an explicit construction of an element of G_{x0} \setminus N_0. This gives us a complete set of generators of \mathbb{M}. It turns out that the matrices of all generators of \mathbb{M} consist of monomial blocks, and of blocks which are essentially Hadamard matrices scaled by a negative power of two. Multiplication with such a generator can be programmed very efficiently if the modulus p is of shape 2^k-1.   So this paper may be considered a as programmer's reference for Conway's construction of the monster group \mathbb{M}. We have implemented representations of \mathbb{M} modulo 3, 7, 15, 31, 127, and 255.
