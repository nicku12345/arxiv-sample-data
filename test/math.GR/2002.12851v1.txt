Let PC be the group of bijections from [0, 1[ to itself which are continuous outside a finite set. Let PC be its quotient by the subgroup of finitely supported permutations. We show that the Kapoudjian class of PC vanishes. That is, the quotient map PC \rightarrow PC splits modulo the alternating subgroup of even permutations. This is shown by constructing a nonzero group homomorphism, called signature, from PC to Z 2Z. Then we use this signature to list normal subgroups of every subgroup G of PC which contains S fin and such that G, the projection of G in PC , is simple.
