A finite group G is called \psi-divisible if \psi(H)|\psi(G) for any subgroup H of G, where \psi(H) and \psi(G) are the sum of element orders of H and G, respectively. In this paper, we extend a result provided in [10], by classifying the finite groups whose all subgroups are \psi-divisible. Since the existence of \psi-divisible groups is related to the class of square-free order groups, we also study the sum of element orders and the \psi-divisibility property of ZM-groups. In the end, we introduce the concept of \psi-normal divisible group, i.e. a group for which the \psi-divisibility property is satisfied by all its normal subgroups. Using simple and quasisimple groups, we are able to construct infinitely many \psi-normal divisible groups which are neither simple nor nilpotent.
