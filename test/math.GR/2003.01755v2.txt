We define train track maps for graphs-of-groups \cal G and exhibit the precise conditions under which the fundamental finiteness properties known for classical train track maps extend to this generalization. These finiteness properties are the crucial tool to control the decrease of illegal turns under iteration of the train track map, and they are a principal ingredient in the answer to basic algorithmic questions about automorphisms induced by such train track maps on \pi_1 \cal G.
