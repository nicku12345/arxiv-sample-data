Assume that G is a finite group and let a and b be non-negative integers. We define an undirected graph \Gamma_{a,b}(G) whose vertices correspond to the elements of G^a\cup G^b and in which two tuples (x_1,\dots,x_a) and (y_1,\dots,y_b) are adjacent if and only \langle x_1,\dots,x_a,y_1,\dots,y_b \rangle =G. Our aim is to estimate the genus, the thickness and the crossing number of the graph \Gamma_{a,b}(G) when a and b are positive integers.
