Let {\rm cs}(G) denote the set of conjugacy class sizes of a group G, and let {\rm cs}^*(G)={\rm cs}(G)\setminus\{1\} be the sizes of non-central classes. We prove three results. We classify all finite groups G with {\rm cs}(G)=\{a, a+d, \dots ,a+rd\} an arithmetic progression with r\geqslant 2. (We show that {\rm cs}(G)=\{1,2,3\}.) Our most substantial result classifies all G with {\rm cs}^*(G)=\{2,4,6\}. Finally, we classify all groups G whose largest two non-central conjugacy class sizes are coprime. (Here it is not obvious but it is true that {\rm cs}^*(G) has two elements, and so is an arithmetic progression.)
