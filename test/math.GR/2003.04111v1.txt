We show that for a large class \mathcal{W} of Coxeter groups the following holds: Given a group W_\Gamma in \mathcal{W}, the automorphism group {\rm Aut}(W_\Gamma) virtually surjects onto W_\Gamma. In particular, the group {\rm Aut}(G_\Gamma) is virtually indicable and therefore does not satisfy Kazhdan's property (T). Moreover, if W_\Gamma is not virtually abelian, then the group {\rm Aut}(W_\Gamma) is large.
