Suppose G is a finite group. The set of all centralizers of 2-element subsets of G is denoted by 2-Cent(G). A group G is called (2,n)-centralizer if |2-Cent(G)| = n and primitive (2,n)-centralizer if |2-Cent(G)| = |2-Cent(\frac{G}{Z(G)})| = n, where Z(G) denotes the center of G. The aim of this paper is to present the main properties of (2,n)-centralizer groups among them a characterization of (2,n)-centralizer and primitive (2,n)-centralizer groups, n \leq 9, are given.
