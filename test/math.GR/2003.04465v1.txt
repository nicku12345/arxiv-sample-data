The automorphism groups of integral Lorentzian lattices act by isometries on hyperbolic space with finite covolume. In the case of reflective integral lattices, the automorphism groups are commensurable to arithmetic hyperbolic reflection groups. However, for a fixed dimension, there is only finitely many reflective integral Lorentzian lattices, and these can only occur in small dimensions. The goal of this note is to construct embeddings of low-dimensional integral Lorentzian lattices into unimodular Lorentzian lattices associated to right-angled reflection groups. As an application, we construct many discrete groups of \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^n) for small n which are C-special in the sense of Haglund-Wise.
