The \emph{graph of irreducible parabolic subgroups} is a combinatorial object associated to an Artin-Tits group A defined so as to coincide with the curve graph of the (n+1)-times punctured disk when A is Artin's braid group on (n+1) strands. In this case, it is a hyperbolic graph, by the celebrated Masur-Minsky's theorem. Hyperbolicity for more general Artin-Tits groups is an important open question. In this paper, we give a partial affirmative answer.   For n\geqslant 3, we prove that the graph of irreducible parabolic subgroups associated to the Artin-Tits group of spherical type B_n is also isomorphic to the curve graph of the (n+1)-times punctured disk, hence it is hyperbolic.   For n\geqslant 2, we show that the graphs of irreducible parabolic subgroups associated to the Artin-Tits groups of euclidean type \widetilde A_n and \widetilde C_n are isomorphic to some subgraphs of the curve graph of the (n+2)-times punctured disk which are not quasi-isometrically embedded. We prove nonetheless that these graphs are hyperbolic.
