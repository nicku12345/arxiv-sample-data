H\'ethelyi and K\"ulshammer showed that the number of conjugacy classes k(G) of any solvable finite group G whose order is divisible by the square of a prime p is at least (49p+1)/60. Here an asymptotic generalization of this result is established. It is proved that there exists a constant c>0 such that for any finite group G whose order is divisible by the square of a prime p we have k(G) \geq cp.
