Let G be a finite group and S be a subset of G. A bi-Cayley graph \BCay(G,S) is a simple and an undirected graph with vertex-set G\times\{1,2\} and edge-set \{\{(g,1),(sg,2)\}\mid g\in G, s\in S\}. A bi-Cayley graph \BCay(G,S) is called a \BCI-graph if for any bi-Cayley graph \BCay(G,T), whenever \BCay(G,S)\cong\BCay(G,T) we have T=gS^\sigma for some g\in G and \sigma\in\Aut(G). A group G is called a \BCI-group if every bi-Cayley graph of G is a \BCI-graph. In this paper, we showed that every \BCI-group is a \CI-group, which gives a positive answer to a conjecture proposed by Arezoomand and Taeri in \cite{arezoomand1}. Also we proved that there is no any non-Abelian 4-\BCI-simple group. In addition all \BCI-groups of order 2p, p a prime, are characterized.
