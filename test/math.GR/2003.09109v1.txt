This article concerns Burger--Mozes universal groups acting on regular trees locally like a given permutation group of finite degree. We also consider locally isomorphic generalizations of the former due to Le Boudec and Lederle. For a large class of such permutation groups and primes p we determine their local p-Sylow subgroups as well as subgroups of their p-localization, which is identified as a group of the same type in certain cases.
