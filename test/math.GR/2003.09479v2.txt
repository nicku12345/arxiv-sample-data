A subgroup H of a group G is said to be {\it pronormal} in G if H and H^g are conjugate in \langle H, H^g \rangle for each g \in G. Some problems in Finite Group Theory, Combinatorics, and Permutation Group Theory were solved in terms of pronormality, therefore, the question of pronormality of a given subgroup in a given group is of interest. Subgroups of odd index in finite groups satisfy a native necessary condition of pronormality. In this paper we continue investigations on pronormality of subgroups of odd index and consider the pronormality question for subgroups of odd index in some direct products of finite groups.   In particular, in this paper we prove that the subgroups of odd index are pronormal in the direct product G of finite simple symplectic groups over fields of odd characteristics if and only if the subgroups of odd index are pronormal in each direct factor of G. Moreover, deciding the pronormality of a given subgroup of odd index in the direct product of simple symplectic groups over fields of odd characteristics is reducible to deciding the pronormality of some subgroup H of odd index in a subgroup of \prod_{i=1}^t \mathbb{Z}_3\wr Sym_{n_i}, where each Sym_{n_i} acts naturally on \{1,\dots, n_i\}, such that H projects onto \prod_{i=1}^t Sym_{n_i}. Thus, in this paper we obtain a criterion of pronormality of a subgroup H of odd index in a subgroup of \prod_{i=1}^t \mathbb{Z}_{p_i}\wr Sym_{n_i}, where each p_i is a prime and each Sym_{n_i} acts naturally on \{1,\dots, n_i\}, such that H projects onto \prod_{i=1}^t Sym_{n_i}.
