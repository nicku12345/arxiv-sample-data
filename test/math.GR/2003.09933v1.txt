Given a group G, we write x^G for the conjugacy class of G containing the element x. A famous theorem of B. H. Neumann states that if G is a group in which all conjugacy classes are finite with bounded size, then the derived group G' is finite. We establish the following result.   Let n be a positive integer and K a subgroup of a group G such that |x^G|\leq n for each x\in K. Let H=\langle K^G\rangle be the normal closure of K. Then the order of the derived group H' is finite and n-bounded.   Some corollaries of this result are also discussed.
