We show that limit varieties of monoids recently discovered by Gusev, Zhang and Luo and their subvarieties are generated by monoids of the form M_\tau(W) for certain congruences \tau on the free monoid. The construction M_\tau(W) is a generalization of widely used Dilworth-Perkins construction. Using this construction, we find explicit generators for Gusev limit varieties and give a short reproof to the fact that Zhang-Luo limit variety is non-finitely based.
