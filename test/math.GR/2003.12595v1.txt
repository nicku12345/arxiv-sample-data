A Hurwitz generating triple for a group G is an ordered triple of elements (x,y,z) \in G^3 where x^2=y^3=z^7=xyz=1 and \langle x,y,z \rangle = G. For the finite quasisimple exceptional groups of types F_4, E_6, ^2E_6, E_7 and E_8, we provide restrictions on which conjugacy classes x, y and z can belong to if (x,y,z) is a Hurwitz generating triple. We prove that there exist Hurwitz generating triples for F_4(3), F_4(5), F_4(7), F_4(8), E_6(3) and E_7(2), and that there are no such triples for F_4(2^{3n-1}), F_4(2^{3n-2}), SE_6(7^n) and {}^2E_6(7^n) \cong {}^2SE_6(7^n), when n \geq 1.
