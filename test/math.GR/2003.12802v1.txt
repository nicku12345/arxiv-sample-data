Let p be a prime number and \mathbb{Z}_p=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}. We study finite groups with abelian derived subgroup and exponent p in terms of group extension data and their matrix presentations. We show a one-to-one correspondence between the following two sets: (i) the isoclasses of class 2 groups of exponent p and order p^{m+n} and with derived subgroup \mathbb{Z}_p^n, and (ii) the set \text{Gr}(n,\text{AS}_m(\mathbb{Z}_p))/\text{GL}_m(\mathbb{Z}_p) of orbits of \text{Gr}(n,\text{AS}_m(\mathbb{Z}_p)) under the congruence action by \text{GL}_m(\mathbb{Z}_p), where \text{Gr}(n,\text{AS}_m(\mathbb{Z}_p)) is the set of n-dimensional subspaces of anti-symmetric matrices of order m over \mathbb{Z}_p. We give a description of the orbit spaces \text{Gr}(2, \text{AS}_m(\mathbb{Z}_p))/\text{GL}_m(\mathbb{Z}_p) for all m and p by applying the theory of pencils of anti-symmetric matrices. Based on this, we show complete sets of representatives of orbits of \text{Gr}(3,\text{AS}_4(\mathbb{Z}_3))/\text{GL}_4(\mathbb{Z}_3), \text{Gr}(4, \text{AS}_4(\mathbb{Z}_3))/\text{GL}_4(\mathbb{Z}_3) and \text{Gr}(3, \text{AS}_5(\mathbb{Z}_3))/\text{GL}_5(\mathbb{Z}_3). As a consequence, we obtain a classification of corresponding class 2 groups of exponent p. In particular, we recover the classification of groups with exponent 3 and order \le 3^8.
