In Question 19.35 of the Kourovka Notebook, M. H. Hooshmand asks whether, given a finite group G and a factorization \mathrm{card}(G)= n_1\ldots n_k, one can always find subsets A_1,\ldots,A_k of G with \mathrm{card}(A_i)=n_i such that G=A_1\ldots A_k; equivalently, such that the group multiplication map A_1\times\ldots\times A_k\to G is a bijection.   We show that for G the alternating group on 4 elements, k=3, and (n_1,n_2,n_3) = (2,3,2), the answer is negative. We then generalize some of the tools used in our proof, and note an open question.
