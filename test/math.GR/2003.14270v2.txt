Let G be a non-abelian finite simple group. A famous result of Liebeck and Shalev is that there is an absolute constant c such that whenever S is a non-trivial normal subset in G then S^{k} = G for any integer k at least c \cdot (\log|G|/\log|S|). This result is generalized by showing that there exists an absolute constant c such that whenever S_{1}, \ldots , S_{k} are normal subsets in G with \prod_{i=1}^{k} |S_{i}| \geq {|G|}^{c} then S_{1} \cdots S_{k} = G.
