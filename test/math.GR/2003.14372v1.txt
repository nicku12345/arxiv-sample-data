In a seminal paper, Brin demonstrates that the outerautomorphism group of Thompson group T is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order two. In this article, building on characterisation of automorphisms of the Higman-Thompson groups G_{n,r} and T_{n,r} as groups of transducers, we give a new proof, automata theoretic in nature, of Brin's result.   We also demonstrate that the group of outerautomorphisms of Thompson's group V = G_{2,1} contains an isomorphic copy of Thompson's group F. This extends a result of the author demonstrating that whenever n \ge 3 and 1 \le r < n the outerautomorphism groups of G_{n,r} and T_{n,r} contain an isomorphic copy of F.
