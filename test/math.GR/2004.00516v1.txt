We introduce the notion of `core growth rate' for strongly synchronizing transducers. We explore some elementary properties of the core growth rate and give examples of transducers with exponential core growth rate. We conjecture that all strongly synchronizing transducers which generate an automaton group of infinite order have exponential core growth rate. There is a connection to the group of automorphisms of the one-sided shift. More specifically, the results of this article are related to the question of whether or not there can exist infinite order automorphisms of the one-sided shift with infinitely many roots.
