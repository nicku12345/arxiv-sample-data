We study when the group \mathbb Z^n\rtimes_A\mathbb Z is arithmetic where A\in GL_n(\mathbb Z) is hyperbolic and semisimple. We begin by giving a characterization of arithmeticity phrased in the language of algebraic tori, building on work of Grunewald-Platonov. We use this to prove several more concrete results that relate the arithmeticity of \mathbb Z^n\rtimes_A\mathbb Z to the reducibility properties of the characteristic polynomial of A. Our tools include algebraic tori, representation theory of finite groups, Galois theory, and the inverse Galois problem.
