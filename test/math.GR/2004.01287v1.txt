We determine the irreducible 2-modular representations of the symplectic group G=Sp_{2n}(2) whose restriction to every abelian subgroup has a trivial constituent. A similar result is obtained for maximal tori of G. There is significant information on the existence of eigenvalue 1 of elements of G in a given irreducible representation of G.
