We generalise a technical tool, originally developed by Pervova for the study of maximal subgroups in Grigorchuk and GGS groups, to all weakly branch groups satisfying a natural condition, and in particular to all branch groups. We then use this tool to prove that every maximal subgroup of infinite index of a branch group is also a branch group. As a further application of this result, we show that every maximal subgroup of the Basilica group is of finite index.
