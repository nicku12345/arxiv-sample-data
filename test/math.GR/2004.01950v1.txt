We examine the subgroup D(G) of a transitive permutation group G which is generated by the derangements in G. Our main results bound the index of this subgroup: we conjecture that, if G has degree n and is not a Frobenius group, then |G:D(G)|\leqslant\sqrt{n}-1; we prove this except when G is a primitive affine group. For affine groups, we translate our conjecture into an equivalent form regarding |H:R(H)|, where H is a linear group on a finite vector space and R(H) is the subgroup of H generated by elements having eigenvalue~1.   If G is a Frobenius group, then D(G) is the Frobenius kernel, and so G/D(G) is isomorphic to a Frobenius complement. We give some examples where D(G)\ne G, and examine the group-theoretic structure of G/D(G); in particular, we construct groups G in which G/D(G) is not a Frobenius complement.
