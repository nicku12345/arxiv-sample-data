Frobenius groups are an object of fundamental importance in finite group theory. As such, several generalizations of these groups have been considered. Some examples include: A Frobenius--Wielandt group is a triple (G,H,L) where H/L is {\it almost} a Frobenius complement for G; A Camina pair is a pair (G,N) where N is {\it almost} a Frobenius kernel for G; A Camina triple is a triple (G,N,M) where (G,N) and (G,M) are {\it almost} Camina pairs. In this paper we study triples (G,N,M) where (G,N) and (G,M) are {\it almost} Frobenius groups.
