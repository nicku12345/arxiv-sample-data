In this paper we discuss graph inverse semigroups which are constucted from a directed graphs and study several interesting properties of graph inverse semigroups such as the nature of its idempotents, the structure of semilattice of idempotents and the like. A necessary and sufficient condition on directed graphs to have the corresponding graph inverse semigroups are primitive inverse semigroups is provided. Further the general form of elements in local submonoids of the graph inverse semigroups and the Green s relations in graph inverse semigroups in graph theoretic terms are also described
