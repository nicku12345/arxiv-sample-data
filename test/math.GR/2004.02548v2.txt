We study finite transitive permutation groups G\leqslant\operatorname{Sym}(\Omega) such that all orbits of the conjugation action on G of the normaliser of G in \operatorname{Sym}(\Omega) have size bounded by some constant. Our results extend recent results, due to the first author, on finite abstract groups G such that all orbits of the natural action of the automorphism group \operatorname{Aut}(G) on G have size bounded by some constant.
