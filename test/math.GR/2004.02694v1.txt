Let G be a finite group, \mu be the M\"obius function on the subgroup lattice of G, and \lambda be the M\"obius function on the poset of conjugacy classes of subgroups of G. It was proved by Pahlings that, whenever G is solvable, the property \mu(H,G)=[N_{G^\prime}(H):G^{\prime}\cap H]\cdot\lambda(H,G) holds for any subgroup H of G. It is known that this property does not hold in general; for instance it does not hold for every simple groups, the Mathieu group M_{12} being a counterexample. In this paper we investigate the relation between \mu and \lambda for some classes of non-solvable groups; among them, the minimal non-solvable groups. We also provide several examples of groups not satisfying the property.
