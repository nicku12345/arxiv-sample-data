The aim of the article is to provide a characterization of Kazhdan's property (T) for locally compact, second countable pairs of groups H\subset G in terms of actions on infinite, \sigma-finite measure spaces. It is inspired by the recent characterization of the Haagerup property by similar actions due to T. Delabie, A. Zumbrunnen and the author.
