We study Schreier dynamical systems associated with a vast family of groups that hosts many known examples of groups of intermediate growth. We are interested in the orbital graphs for the actions of these groups on d-regular rooted trees and on their boundaries, viewed as topological spaces or as spaces with measure. They form interesting families of finitely ramified graphs, and we study their combinatorics, their isomorphism classes and their geometric properties, such as growth and the number of ends.
