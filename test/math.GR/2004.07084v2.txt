Given any group G, the normalizer \mathrm{Hol}(G) of the subgroup of left translations in the group of all permutations on G is called the holomorph, and the normalizer \mathrm{NHol}(G) of \mathrm{Hol}(G) in turn is called the multiple holomorph. The quotient T(G) = \mathrm{NHol}(G)/\mathrm{Hol}(G) has been computed for various families of groups G in the literature. In this paper, we shall supplement the existing results by considering finite split metacyclic p-groups G  with p an odd prime. We are able to give a closed formula for the order of T(G) when G satisfies some mild conditions. Our work gives a new family of groups G for which T(G) is not a 2-group.
