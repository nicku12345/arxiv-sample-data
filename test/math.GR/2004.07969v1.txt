In this work we study some structural properties of the group \eta^q(G, H), q a non-negative integer, which is an extension of the q-tensor product G \otimes^q H), where G and H are normal subgroups of some group L. We establish by simple arguments some closure properties of \eta^q(G,H) when G and H belong to certain Schur classes. This extends similar results concerning the case q = 0 found in the literature. Restricting our considerations to the case G = H, we compute the q-tensor square D_n \otimes^q D_n for q odd, where D_n denotes the dihedral group of order 2n. Upper bounds to the exponent of G \otimes^q G are also established for nilpotent groups G of class \leq 3, which extend to all q \geq 0 similar bound found by Moravec in [21].
