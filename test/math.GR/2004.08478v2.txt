Let 1 \le r < n be integers. We give a proof that the group \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}({X_{n}^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma_{n}}) of automorphisms of the one-sided shift on n letters embeds naturally as a subgroup \mathcal{h}_{n} of the outer automorphism group \mathop{\mathrm{Out}}(G_{n,r}) of the Higman-Thompson group G_{n,r}. From this, we can represent the elements of \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}({X_{n}^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma_{n}}) by finite state non-initial transducers admitting a very strong synchronizing condition.   Let H \in \mathcal{H}_{n} and write |H| for the number of states of the minimal transducer representing H. We show that H can be written as a product of at most |H| torsion elements. This result strengthens a similar result of Boyle, Franks and Kitchens, where the decomposition involves more complex torsion elements and also does not support practical \textit{a priori} estimates of the length of the resulting product.   We also give new proofs of some known results about \mathop{\mathrm{Aut}}({X_{n}^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma_{n}}).
