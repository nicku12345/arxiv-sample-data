Let k be an algebraically closed field, G a linear algebraic group over k and \varphi\in Aut(G), the group of all algebraic group automorphisms of G. Two elements x, y of G are said to be \varphi-twisted conjugate if y=gx\varphi(g)^{-1} for some g\in G. In this paper we prove that for a connected non-solvable linear algebraic group G over k, the number of its \varphi-twisted conjugacy classes is infinite for every \varphi\in Aut(G).
