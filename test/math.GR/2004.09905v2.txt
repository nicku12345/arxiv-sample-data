An odd Coxeter group W is one which admits a Coxeter system (W,S) for which all the exponents m_{ij} are either odd or infinity. The paper investigates the family of odd Coxeter groups whose associated labeled graphs \mathcal{V}_{(W,S)} are trees. It is known that two Coxeter groups in this family are isomorphic if and only if they admit Coxeter systems having the same rank and the same multiset of finite exponents. In particular, each group in this family is isomorphic to a group that admits a Coxeter system whose associated labeled graph is a star shaped tree. We give the complete description of the automorphism group of this group, and derive a sufficient condition for the splitting of the automorphism group as a semi-direct product of the inner and the outer automorphism groups. As applications, we prove that Coxeter groups in this family satisfy the R_\infty-property and are (co)-Hopfian. We compare structural properties, automorphism groups, \R_\infty-property and (co)-Hopfianity of a special odd Coxeter group whose only finite exponent is three with the braid group and the twin group.
