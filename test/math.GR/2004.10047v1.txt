Let G be a group. A function G\rightarrow G of the form x\mapsto x^{\alpha}g for a fixed automorphism \alpha of G and a fixed g\in G is called an affine map of G. In this paper, we study finite groups G with an affine map of large order. More precisely, we show that if G admits an affine map of order larger than \frac{1}{2}|G|, then G is solvable of derived length at most 3. We also show that more generally, for each \rho\in\left(0,1\right], if G admits an affine map of order at least \rho|G|, then the largest solvable normal subgroup of G has derived length at most 4\lfloor\log_2(\rho^{-1})\rfloor+3.
