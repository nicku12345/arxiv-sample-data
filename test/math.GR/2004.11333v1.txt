A {\it graph product} G on a graph \Gamma is a group defined as follows: For each vertex v of \Gamma there is a corresponding non-trivial group G_v. The group G is the quotient of the free product of the G_v by the commutation relations [G_v,G_w]=1 for all adjacent v and w in \Gamma. A finitely presented group G has {\it semistable fundamental group at \infty} if for some (equivalently any) finite connected CW-complex X with \pi_1(X)=G, the universal cover \tilde X of X has the property that any two proper rays in \tilde X are properly homotopic. The class of finitely presented groups with semistable fundamental group at \infty is known to contain many other classes of groups, but it is a 40 year old question as to whether or not all finitely presented groups have semistable fundamental group at \infty. Our main theorem is a combination result. It states that if G is a graph product on a finite graph \Gamma and each vertex group is finitely presented, then G has non-semistable fundamental group at \infty if and only if there is a vertex v of \Gamma such that G_v is not semistable, and the subgroup of G generated by the vertex groups of vertices adjacent to v is finite (equivalently lk(v) is a complete graph and each vertex group of lk(v) is finite). Hence if one knows which vertex groups of G are not semistable and which are finite, then an elementary inspection of \Gamma determines whether or not G has semistable fundamental group at \infty.
