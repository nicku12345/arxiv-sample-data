Let H \leq S_n be an intransitive group with orbits \Omega_1, \Omega_2, \ldots ,\Omega_k. Then certainly H is a subdirect product of the direct product of its projections on each orbit, H|_{\Omega_1} \times H|_{\Omega_2} \times \ldots \times H|_{\Omega_k}. Here we provide a polynomial time algorithm for computing the finest partition P of the H-orbits such that H = \prod_{c \in P} H|_c and demonstrate its usefulness in some applications.
