A right Engel sink of an element g of a group G is a set {\mathscr R}(g) such that for every x\in G all sufficiently long commutators [...[[g,x],x],\dots ,x] belong to {\mathscr R}(g). (Thus, g is a right Engel element precisely when we can choose {\mathscr R}(g)=\{ 1\}.) It is proved that if every element of a compact (Hausdorff) group G has a countable (or finite) right Engel sink, then G has a finite normal subgroup N such that G/N is locally nilpotent.
