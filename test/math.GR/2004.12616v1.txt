Let G be a connected reductive group defined over \mathbb F_q. Fix an integer M\geq 2, and consider the power map x\mapsto x^M on G. We denote the image of G(\mathbb F_q) under this map by G(\mathbb F_q)^M and estimate what proportion of regular semisimple, semisimple and regular elements of G(\mathbb F_q) it contains. We prove that as q\to\infty, all of these proportions are equal and provide a formula for the same. We also calculate this more explicitly for the groups \text{GL}(n,q) and \text{U}(n,q).
