The proper subgroup B of the group G is called {\it strongly embedded}, if 2\in\pi(B) and 2\notin\pi(B \cap B^g) for any element g \in G \setminus B  and, therefore,  N_G(X) \leq B for any 2-subgroup  X \leq B . An element a of a group G is called {\it finite} if for all  g\in G  the subgroups  \langle a, a^g \rangle  are finite. In the paper, it is proved that the group with finite element of order 4 and strongly embedded subgroup isomorphic to the Borel subgroup of U_3(Q) over a locally finite field Q of characteristic 2 is locally finite and isomorphic to the group U_3(Q).   Keywords: A strongly embedded subgroup of a unitary type, subgroups of Borel, Cartan, involution, finite element.
