In this note, we unify and extend various concepts in the area of G-complete reducibility, where G is a reductive algebraic group. By results of Serre and Bate--Martin--R\"{o}hrle, the usual notion of G-complete reducibility can be re-framed as a property of an action of a group on the spherical building of the identity component of G. We show that other variations of this notion, such as relative complete reducibility and \sigma-complete reducibility, can also be viewed as special cases of this building-theoretic definition, and hence a number of results from these areas are special cases of more general properties.
