Let G be a nonabelian group. We say that G has an abelian partition, if there exists a partition of G into commuting subsets A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n of G, such that |A_i|\geqslant 2 for each i=1, 2, \ldots, n. This paper investigates problems relating to group with abelian partitions. Among other results, we show that every finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an abelian partition and also isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with no abelian partition. We also find bounds for the minimum number of partitions for several families of groups which admit abelian partitions -- with exact calculations in some cases. Finally, we examine how the size of partitions with the minimum number of parts behaves with respect to the direct product.
