We observe that the lift of Thompson's group T to the real line is finitely presented and contains the additive group \mathbb{Q} of the rational numbers. This gives an explicit realization of the Higman embedding theorem for \mathbb{Q}, answering a Kourovka notebook question of Martin Bridson and Pierre de la Harpe.   We also prove that \mathbb{Q} can be embedded into a finitely presented simple group, explicitly realizing the Boone-Higman theorem for \mathbb{Q}. Specifically, we describe a simple group T\!\hspace{0.1em}\mathcal{A} of homeomorphisms of the circle that contains \mathbb{Q}, and we prove that T\!\hspace{0.1em}\mathcal{A} is two-generated and has type \mathrm{F}_\infty. Our method for proving finiteness properties extends existing techniques to allow for groups of homeomorphisms that are locally more complicated than the standard Thompson groups.
