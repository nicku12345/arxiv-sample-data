Let m\leq n be positive integers and \mathfrak X a class of groups which is closed for subgroups, quotient groups and extensions. Suppose that a finite group G satisfies the condition that for every two subsets M and N of cardinalities m and n, respectively, there exist x \in M and y \in N such that \langle x, y \rangle\in \mathfrak X. Then either G\in \mathfrak X or |G|\leq \left(\frac{180}{53}\right)^m(n-1).
