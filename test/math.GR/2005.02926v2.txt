Let (R, \Delta) be an odd form algebra. We show that the unitary Steinberg group \mathrm{StU}(R, \Delta) is a crossed module over the odd unitary group \mathrm U(R, \Delta) in two major cases: if the odd form algebra has a free orthogonal hyperbolic family satisfying a local stable rank condition and if the odd form algebra is sufficiently isotropic and quasi-finite. The proof uses only elementary localization techniques in terms of pro-groups.
