The congruence subgroup problem for a finitely generated group \Gamma and G\leq Aut(\Gamma) asks whether the map \hat{G}\to Aut(\hat{\Gamma}) is injective, or more generally, what is its kernel C\left(G,\Gamma\right)? Here \hat{X} denotes the profinite completion of X. In the case G=Aut(\Gamma) we denote C\left(\Gamma\right)=C\left(Aut(\Gamma),\Gamma\right).   Let \Gamma be a finitely generated group, \bar{\Gamma}=\Gamma/[\Gamma,\Gamma], and \Gamma^{*}=\bar{\Gamma}/tor(\bar{\Gamma})\cong\mathbb{Z}^{(d)}. Denote Aut^{*}(\Gamma)=\textrm{Im}(Aut(\Gamma)\to Aut(\Gamma^{*}))\leq GL_{d}(\mathbb{Z}). In this paper we show that when \Gamma is nilpotent, there is a canonical isomorphism C\left(\Gamma\right)\simeq C(Aut^{*}(\Gamma),\Gamma^{*}). In other words, C\left(\Gamma\right) is completely determined by the solution to the classical congruence subgroup problem for the arithmetic group Aut^{*}(\Gamma).   In particular, in the case where \Gamma=\Psi_{n,c} is a finitely generated free nilpotent group of class c on n elements, we get that C(\Psi_{n,c})=C(\mathbb{Z}^{(n)})=\{e\} whenever n\geq3, and C(\Psi_{2,c})=C(\mathbb{Z}^{(2)})=\hat{F}_{\omega} = the free profinite group on countable number of generators.
