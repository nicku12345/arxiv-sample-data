Let w be a word in k variables. For a finite nilpotent group G, a conjecture of Amit states that N_w(1) \ge |G|^{k-1}, where N_w(1) is the number of k-tuples (g_1,...,g_k)\in G^{(k)} such that w(g_1,...,g_k)=1. Currently, this conjecture is known to be true for groups of nilpotency class 2. Here we consider a generalized version of Amit's conjecture, and prove that N_w(g) \ge |G|^{k-2}, where g is a w-value in G, for finite groups G of odd order and nilpotency class 2. If w is a word in two variables, we further show that N_w(g) \ge |G|, where g is a w-value in G for finite groups G of nilpotency class 2. In addition, for p a prime, we show that finite p-groups G, with two distinct irreducible complex character degrees, satisfy the generalized Amit conjecture for words w_k =[x_1,y_1]...[x_k,y_k] with k a natural number; that is, for g a w_k-value in G we have N_{w_k}(g) \ge |G|^{2k-1}.   Finally, we discuss the related group properties of being rational and chiral, and show that every finite group of nilpotency class 2 is rational.
