Let G be a finite group, and let cs(G) be the set of conjugacy class sizes of G. Recalling that an element g of G is called a \emph{vanishing element} if there exists an irreducible character of G taking the value 0 on g, we consider one particular subset of cs(G), namely, the set vcs(G) whose elements are the conjugacy class sizes of the vanishing elements of G. Motivated by the results in \cite{BLP}, we describe the class of the finite groups G such that vcs(G) consists of a single element \emph{under the assumption that G is supersolvable or G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup} (in particular, groups of odd order are covered). As a particular case, we also get a characterization of finite groups having a single vanishing conjugacy class size \emph{which is either a prime power or square-free}.
