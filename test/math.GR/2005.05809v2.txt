Given a finite group  G , we study certain regular subgroups of the group of permutations of  G , which occur in the classification theories of two types of algebraic objects: Hopf-Galois structures admitted by a Galois extension of fields with Galois group isomorphic to  G  and skew left braces with multiplicative group isomorphic to  G . We partition this collection of subgroups in different ways, and use the interplay between these partitions to translate structural information between the two theories. In particular, we show that in some cases the isomorphism class of the Hopf algebra giving a Hopf-Galois structure is determined by the corresponding skew left brace. As applications of our results, we classify the isomorphically distinct Hopf algebras that give Hopf-Galois structures on a Galois extension of degree  pq , and give a new approach to the classification of skew left braces of order  pq , for  p>q  prime numbers.
