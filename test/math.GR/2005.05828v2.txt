Let G be a finite group. Define a graph on the set G^{\#} = G \setminus \{ 1 \} by declaring distinct elements x,y\in G^{\#} to be adjacent if and only if \langle x,y\rangle is cyclic. Denote this graph by \Delta(G). The graph \Delta(G) has appeared in the literature under the names cyclic graph and deleted enhanced power graph. If G and H are nontrivial groups, then \Delta(G\times H) is completely characterized. In particular, if \Delta(G\times H) is connected, then a diameter bound is obtained, along with an example meeting this bound. Also, necessary and sufficient conditions for the disconnectedness of \Delta(G\times H) are established.
