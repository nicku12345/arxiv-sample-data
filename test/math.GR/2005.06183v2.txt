We prove that every countable left-ordered group embeds into a finitely generated left-ordered simple group. Moreover, if the first group has a computable left-order, then the simple group also has a computable left-order.   We also obtain a Boone-Higman-Thompson type theorem for left-orderable groups with recursively enumerable positive cones. These embeddings are Frattini embeddings, and isometric whenever the initial group is finitely generated.   Finally, we reprove Thompson's theorem on word problem preserving embeddings into finitely generated simple groups and observe that the embedding is isometric.
