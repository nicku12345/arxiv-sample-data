We prove that linear groups over rings of non-commutative Laurent polynomials D_{\tau} have Tits systems with the corresponding affine Weyl groups and have universal central extensions if |Z(D)|\geq 5 and |Z(D)|\neq 9. We also determine structures of K_1-groups and identify generators of K_2-groups.
