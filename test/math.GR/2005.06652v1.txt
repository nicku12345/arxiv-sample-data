We prove that every uniform approximate homomorphism from a discrete amenable group into a symmetric group is uniformly close to a homomorphism into a slightly larger symmetric group. That is, amenable groups are uniformly flexibly stable in permutations. This answers affirmatively a question of Kun and Thom and a slight variation of a question of Lubotzky. We also give a negative answer to Lubotzky's original question by showing that the group \mathbb{Z} is not uniformly strictly stable. Furthermore, we show that \text{SL}_{r}(\mathbb{Z}), r\geq3, is uniformly flexibly stable, but the free group F_{r}, r\geq 2, is not. We define and investigate a probabilistic variant of uniform stability that has an application to property testing.
