To a finitely generated profinite group G, a formal Dirichlet series P_G(s)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb N} {a_n(G)}/{n^s} is associated, where a_n(G)=\sum_{|G:H|=n}\mu(H, G) and \mu(H,G) denotes the M\"obius function of the lattice of open subgroups of G. Its formal inverse P_G^{-1}(s) is the probabilistic zeta function of G. When G is prosoluble, every coefficient of (P_G(s))^{-1} is nonnegative. In this paper we discuss the general case and we produce % existence of a non-prosoluble example and We construct a non-prosoluble finitely generated group G with the same property.
