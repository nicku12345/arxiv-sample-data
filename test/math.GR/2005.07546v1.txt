Given a group G of homeomorphism of a first-countable Hausdorff space \mathcal{X}, we prove that if the action of G on \mathcal{X} is minimal and has rigid stabilisers that act locally minimally, then the neighbourhood stabilisers of any two points in \mathcal{X} are conjugated by a homeomorphism of \mathcal{X}. This allows us to study stabilisers of points in many classes of groups, such as topological full groups of Cantor minimal systems, Thompson groups, branch groups, and groups acting on trees with almost prescribed local actions.
