We investigate the operation of torus surgery on tori embedded in S^4. Key questions include which 4-manifolds can be obtained in this way, and the uniqueness of such descriptions. As an application we construct embeddings of 3-manifolds into 4-manifolds by viewing Dehn surgery as a cross section of a surgery on a surface. In particular, we give new embeddings of homology spheres into S^4.
