We generalize the idea of unknotting knots to Seifert surfaces. We define an operation called ribbon twist which serves as the equivalent of a crossing change for knots. A Seifert surface is considered untwisted, the equivalent to unknotted, if it is isotopic to a standardly embedded n-fold punctured torus. A Seifert surface is said to be twist trivial if it can be untwisted by ribbon twists. We show that canonical Seifert surfaces are twist trivial.
