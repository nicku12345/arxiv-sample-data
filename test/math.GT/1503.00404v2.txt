A 2-dimensional braid over an oriented surface-knot F is presented by a graph called a chart on a surface diagram of F. We consider 2-dimensional braids obtained by an addition of 1-handles equipped with chart loops. We introduce moves of 1-handles with chart loops, called 1-handle moves, and we investigate how much we can simplify a 2-dimensional braid by using 1-handle moves. Further, we show that an addition of 1-handles with chart loops is an unbraiding operation.
