This paper is devoted to the study of prime alternating +achiral knots. In the case of arborescent knots, we prove in the +AAA Visibility Theorem 5.1, that the symmetry is visible on some (not necessarily minimal) projection and that it is realized by a homeomorphism of order 4. In the general case (arborescent or not), if the prime alternating knot has no minimal projection on which the +achirality is visible, we prove that the order of +achirality is necessarily equal to 4.
