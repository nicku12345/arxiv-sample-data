We give upper bounds of the Matveev complexities of two-bridge link complements by constructing their spines explicitly. In particular, we determine the complexities for an infinite sequence of two-bridge links corresponding to the continued fractions of the form [2,1,...,1,2]. We also give upper bounds for the 3-manifolds obtained as meridian-cyclic branched coverings of the 3-sphere along two-bridge links.
