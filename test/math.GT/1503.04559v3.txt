Let F_g denote a closed oriented surface of genus g. A set of simple closed curves is called a filling of F_g if its complement is a disjoint union of discs. The mapping class group \text{Mod}(F_g) of genus g acts on the set of fillings of F_g. The union of the curves in a filling forms a graph on the surface which is a so-called decorated fat graph. It is a fact that two fillings of F_g are in the same \text{Mod}(F_g)-orbit if and only if the corresponding fat graphs are isomorphic. We prove that any filling of F_2 whose complement is a single disc (i.e., a so-called minimal filling) has either three or four closed curves and in each of these two cases, there is a unique such filling up to the action of \text{Mod}(F_2).   We provide a constructive proof to show that the minimum number of discs in the complement of a filling pair of F_2 is two. Finally, given positive integers g and k with (g, k)\neq (2, 1), we construct a filling pair of F_g such that the complement is a union of k topological discs.
