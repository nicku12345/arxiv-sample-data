We prove that the Gromov boundary of every hyperbolic group is homeomorphic to some Markov compactum. Our reasoning is based on constructing a sequence of covers of \partial G, which is quasi-G-invariant wrt. the ball N-type (defined by Cannon) for N sufficiently large. We also ensure certain additional properties for the inverse system representing \partial G, leading to a finite description which defines it uniquely.   By defining a natural metric on the inverse limit \lim K_n and proving it to be bi-Lipschitz equivalent to an accordingly chosen visual metric on \partial G, we prove that our construction enables providing a simplicial description of the natural quasi-conformal structure on \partial G. We also point out that the initial system of covers can be modified so that all the simplexes in the resulting inverse system are of dimension less than or equal to \dim \partial G.   We also generalize --- from the torsion-free case to all finitely generated hyperbolic groups --- a theorem guaranteeing the existence of a finite representation of \partial G of another kind, namely a semi-Markovian structure (which can be understood as an analogue of the well-known automatic structure of G itself).
