We construct maps on hat Heegaard Floer homology for cobordisms decorated with graphs. The graph TQFT allows for cobordisms with disconnected ends. Our construction uses Juh\'{a}sz's sutured Floer TQFT. We compute the maps for several elementary graph cobordisms. As an application, we compute the action of the fundamental group on hat Heegaard Floer homology.
