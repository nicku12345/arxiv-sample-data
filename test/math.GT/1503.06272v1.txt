In this article we construct a family of knot surgery 4-manifolds admitting arbitrarily many nonisomorphic Lefschetz fibration structures with the same genus fiber. We obtain such families by performing knot surgery on an elliptic surface E(2) using connected sums of fibered knots obtained by Stallings twist from a slice knot 3_1 \sharp 3^*_1.   By comparing their monodromy groups induced from the corresponding monodromy factorizations, we show that they admit mutually nonisomorphic Lefschetz fibration structures.
