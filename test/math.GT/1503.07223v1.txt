We introduce generalized arrow diagrams and generalized Reidemeister moves for diagrams of links in Seifert fibered spaces. We give a presentation of the fundamental group of the link complement. As a corollary we are able to compute the first homology group of the complement and the twisted Alexander polynomials of the link.
