We show that the Thurston norm of any irreducible 3-manifold can be detected using twisted Reidemeister torsions corresponding to integral representations and also corresponding to representations over finite fields. In particular our result holds for all graph manifolds, these are not covered by the earlier work of the first author and Vidussi.
