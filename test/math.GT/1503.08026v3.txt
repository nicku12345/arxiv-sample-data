Polyak showed that any Milnor's \overline{\mu}-invariant of length 3 can be represented as a combination of Conway polynomials of knots obtained by certain band sum of the link components. On the other hand, Habegger and Lin showed that Milnor invariants are also invariants for string links, called \mu-invariants. We show that any Milnor's {\mu}-invariant of length \leq k+2 can be represented as a combination of the HOMFLYPT polynomials of knots obtained from the string link by some operation, if all {\mu}-invariants of length \leq k vanish. Moreover, {\mu}-invariants of length 3 are given by a combination of the Conway polynomials and linking numbers without any vanishing assumption.
