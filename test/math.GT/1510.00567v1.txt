Let M be a 3-manifold, compact with boundary and \Gamma its fundamental group. Consider a complex reductive algebraic group G. The character variety X(\Gamma,G) is the GIT quotient \mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,G)//G of the space of morphisms \Gamma\to G by the natural action by conjugation of G. In the case G=\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb C) this space has been thoroughly studied.   Following work of Thurston, as presented by Culler-Shalen, we give a lower bound for the dimension of irreducible components of X(\Gamma,G) in terms of the Euler characteristic \chi(M) of M, the number t of torus boundary components of M, the dimension d and the rank r of G. Indeed, under mild assumptions on an irreducible component X_0 of X(\Gamma,G), we prove the inequality \mathrm{dim}(X_0)\geq t \cdot r - d\chi(M).
