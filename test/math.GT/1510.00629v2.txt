The main goal of this note is to provide evidence that the first rational homology of the Johnson subgroup K_{g,1} of the mapping class group of a genus g surface with one marked point is finite-dimensional. Building on work of Dimca-Papadima, we use symplectic representation theory to show that, for all g > 3, the completion of H_1(K_{g,1},\mathbb{Q}) with respect to the augmentation ideal in the rational group algebra of \mathbb{Z}^{2g} is finite-dimensional. We also show that the terms of the Johnson filtration of the mapping class group have infinite-dimensional rational homology in some degrees in almost all genera, generalizing a result of Akita.
