We prove that links with meridional rank 3 whose 2-fold branched covers are graph manifolds are 3-bridge links. This gives a partial answer to a question by S. Cappell and J. Shaneson on the relation between the bridge numbers and meridional ranks of links. To prove this, we also show that the meridional rank of any satellite knot is at least 4.
