We consider the orientation-preserving actions of finite groups G on pairs (S^3, \Gamma), where \Gamma is a connected graph of genus g>1, embedded in S^3. For each g we give the maximum order m_g of such G acting on (S^3, \Gamma) for all such \Gamma\subset S^3. Indeed we will classify all graphs \Gamma\subset S^3 which realize these m_g in different levels: as abstract graphs and as spatial graphs, as well as their group actions.   Such maximum orders without the condition "orientation-preserving" are also addressed.
