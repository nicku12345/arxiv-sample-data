Given \phi a pseudo-Anosov map, let \ell_\mathcal{T}(\phi) denote the translation length of \phi in the Teichm\"uller space, and let \ell_\mathcal{C}(\phi) denote the stable translation length of \phi in the curve graph. Gadre--Hironaka--Kent--Leininger showed that, as a function of Euler characteristic \chi(S), the minimal possible ratio \tau(\phi) = \frac{\ell_\mathcal{T}(\phi)}{\ell_\mathcal{C}(\phi)} is \log(|\chi(S)|), up to uniform additive and multiplicative constants. In this short note, we introduce a new construction of such ratio optimizers and demonstrate their abundance in the mapping class group. Further, we show that ratio optimizers can be found arbitrarily deep into the Johnson filtration as well as in the point pushing subgroup.
