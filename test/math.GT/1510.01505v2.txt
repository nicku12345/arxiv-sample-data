We study subgroups of {\rm PU}(2,1) generated by two non-commuting unipotent maps A and B whose product AB is also unipotent. We call \mathcal{U} the set of conjugacy classes of such groups. We provide a set of coordinates on \mathcal{U} that make it homeomorphic to \mathbb{R}^2 . By considering the action on complex hyperbolic space \mathbf{H}^2_{\mathbb{C}} of groups in \mathcal{U}, we describe a two dimensional disc {\mathcal Z} in \mathcal{U} that parametrises a family of discrete groups. As a corollary, we give a proof of a conjecture of Schwartz for (3,3,\infty)-triangle groups. We also consider a particular group on the boundary of the disc {\mathcal Z} where the commutator [A,B] is also unipotent. We show that the boundary of the quotient orbifold associated to the latter group gives a spherical CR uniformisation of the Whitehead link complement.
