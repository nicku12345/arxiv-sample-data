Fox coloring provides a combinatorial framework for studying dihedral representations of the knot group. The less well-known concept of Dehn coloring captures the same data. Recent work of Carter-Silver-Williams clarifies the relationship between the two focusing on how one transitions between Fox and Dehn colorings. In our work, we relate Dehn coloring to the dimer model for knots showing that Dehn coloring data is encoded by a certain weighted balanced overlaid Tait graph. Using Kasteleyn theory, we provide graph theoretic methods for computing the determinant and Smith normal form of a knot. These constructions are closely related to Kauffman's work on a state sum for the Alexander polynomial.
