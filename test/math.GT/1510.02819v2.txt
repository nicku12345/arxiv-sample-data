The Khovanov homology of a link in S^3 and the Heegaard Floer homology of its branched double cover are related through a spectral sequence constructed by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o. This spectral sequence has topological applications but is difficult to compute. We build an isomorphic spectral sequence whose underlying filtered complex is as simple as possible: it has the same rank as the Khovanov chain group. We show that this spectral sequence is not isomorphic to Szab\'o's combinatorial spectral sequence, which Seed and Szab\'o conjectured to be equivalent to Ozsv\'ath-\Szabo's. The discrepancy leads us to define a variation of Szab\'o's theory for links embedded in a thickened annulus. We conclude with a refinement of Seed and Szab\'o's conjecture for the new theory.
