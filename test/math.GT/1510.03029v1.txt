We introduce and study a new class of homotopy spheres called Farrell-Jones spheres. Using Farrell-Jones sphere we construct examples of closed negatively curved manifolds M^{2n}, where n=7 or 8, which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to complex hyperbolic manifolds, thereby giving a partial answer to a question raised by C.S. Aravinda and F.T. Farrell. We show that every exotic sphere not bounding a spin manifold (Hitchin sphere) is a Farrell-Jones sphere. We also discuss the relationship between inertia groups of \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n and Farrell-Jones spheres.
