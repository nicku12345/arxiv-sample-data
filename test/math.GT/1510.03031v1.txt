Let M^{2n} denote a closed (n-1)-connected smoothable topological 2n-manifold. We show that the group \mathcal{C}(M^{2n}) of concordance classes of smoothings of M^{2n} is isomorphic to the group of smooth homotopy spheres \overline{\Theta}_{2n} for n=4 or 5, the concordance inertia group I_c(M^{2n})=0 for n=3, 4, 5 or 11 and the homotopy inertia group I_h(M^{2n})=0 for n=4. On the way, following Wall's approach \cite{Wal67} we present a new proof of the main result in \cite{KS07}, namely, for n=4, 8 and H^{n}(M^{2n};\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}, the inertia group I(M^{2n})\cong \mathbb{Z}_2. We also show that, up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, M^{8} has at most two distinct smooth structures; M^{10} has exactly six distinct smooth structures and then show that if M^{14} is a \pi-manifold, M^{14} has exactly two distinct smooth structures.
