We classify, up to diffeomorphism, all closed smooth manifolds homeomorphic to the complex projective n-space \mathbb{C}\textbf{P}^n, where n=3 and 4. Let M^{2n} be a closed smooth 2n-manifold homotopy equivalent to \mathbb{C}\textbf{P}^n. We show that, up to diffeomorphism, M^{6} has a unique differentiable structure and M^{8} has at most two distinct differentiable structures. We also show that, up to concordance, there exist at least two distinct differentiable structures on a finite sheeted cover N^{2n} of \mathbb{C}\textbf{P}^n for n=4, 7 or 8 and six distinct differentiable structures on N^{10}.
