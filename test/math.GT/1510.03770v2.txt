Let \mathcal{A} be a central hyperplane arrangement in \mathbb{C}^{n+1} and H_i,i=1,2,...,d be the defining equations of the hyperplanes of \mathcal{A}. Let f=\prod_i H_i. There is a global Milnor fibration F\hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus \mathcal{A} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{C}^*, where F is called the Milnor fiber and can be identified as the affine hypersurface f=1 in \mathbb{C}^{n+1}.   Many open questions have been raised subject to F. In particular, it has been conjectured that the integral homology, or the characteristic polynomial, hence the Betti numbers, of F are also determined by the intersection lattice L(\mathcal{A}).   In this paper, we find a combinatorial upper bound for the first the characteristic polynomial of the Milnor fiber for central hyperplane arrangements, which improves existing results in the study. As a corollary, we obtain a combinatorial obstruction for trivial algebraic monodromy of the first homology of Milnor fiber. Calculations and comparisons to known examples computed using Fox calculus will be provided.
