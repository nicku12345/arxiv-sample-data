We give an explicit formula for the action of the Dehn twist along a simple closed curve in a compact connected oriented surface on the completion of the filtered skein modules. To do this, we introduce filtrations of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra and the Kauffman bracket skein modules on the surface.
