Tomova, along with results of Bachman and Schleimer, showed that any high distance knot has a stair-step bridge spectrum. In this paper, we compute the bridge spectra and distance of generalized Montesinos knots. In particular, we produce the first example of a class of knots which attain the stair-step bridge spectra but are not high distance, by computing the bridge spectra of certain pretzel knots and Montesinos knots.
