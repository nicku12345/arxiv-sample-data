For a 3-manifold M with boundary, we study the Kauffman module with indeterminate equal to -1+\epsilon where \epsilon^2=0. We conjecture an explicit relation between this module and the Reidemeister torsion of M which we prove in particular cases. As a maybe useful tool, we then introduce a notion of twisted self-linking and prove that it satisfies the Kauffman relations at first order. These questions come from considerations on asymptotics of quantum invariants.
