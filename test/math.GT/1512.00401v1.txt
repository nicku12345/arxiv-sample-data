We define an operation on homology {B}^4 which we call an n-twist annulus modification. We give a new construction of smoothly slice knots and exotically slice knots via n-twist annulus modifications. As an application, we present a new example of a smoothly slice knot with non-slice derivatives. Such examples were first discovered by Cochran and Davis. Also, we relate n-twist annulus modifications to n-fold annulus twists which was first introduced by Osoinach, then has been used by Abe and Tange to construct smoothly slice knots. Furthermore we consider n-twist annulus modifications in more general setting to show that any exotically slice knot can be obtained by the image of the unknot in the boundary of a smooth 4-manifold homeomorphic to {B}^4 after an annulus modification.
