Virtual knot theory is a generalization of knot theory which is based on Gauss chord diagrams and link diagrams on closed oriented surfaces. A twisted knot is a generalization of a virtual knot, which corresponds to a link diagram on a possibly non-orientable surface. In this paper, we discuss an invariant of twisted links which is obtained from the JKSS invariant of virtual links by use of double coverings. We also discuss some properties of double covering diagrams.
