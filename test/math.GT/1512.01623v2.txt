This paper is an exposition of the relationship between Witten's Chern-Simons functional integral and the theory of Vassiliev Invariants of knots and links in three dimensional space. We conceptualize the functional integral in terms of equivalence classes of functionals of gauge fields and we do not use measure theory. This approach makes it possible to discuss the mathematics intrinsic to the functional integral rigorously and without functional integration. Applications to loop quantum gravity are discussed. We thank the organizers of the Conference on 60 Years of Yang-Mills Gauge Field Theories (25 to 28 May 2015) for the invitation and opportunity to speak about these ideas in Singapore.
