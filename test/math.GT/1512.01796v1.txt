In this paper, it is shown that every point in the hyperbolic 3-space is moved at a distance at least 0.5\log\left(12\cdot 3^{k-1}-3\right) by one of the isometries of length at most k\geq 2 in a 2-generator Klenian group \Gamma which is torsion-free, not co-compact and contains no parabolic. Also some lower bounds for the maximum of hyperbolic displacements given by symmetric subsets of isometries in purely loxodromic finitely generated free Kleinian groups are conjectured.
