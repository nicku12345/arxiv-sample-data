Koberda proved that if a graph \Gamma is a full subgraph of a curve graph \mathcal{C}(S) of an orientable surface S, then the right-angled Artin group A(\Gamma) on \Gamma is a subgroup of the mapping class group {\rm Mod}(S) of S. On the other hand, for a sufficiently complicated surface S, Kim-Koberda gave a graph \Gamma which is not contained in \mathcal{C}(S), but A(\Gamma) is a subgroup of {\rm Mod}(S). In this paper, we prove that if \Gamma is a full subgraph of a disk graph \mathcal{D}(H) of a handlebody H, then A(\Gamma) is a subgroup of the handlebody group {\rm Mod}(H) of H. Further, we show that there is a graph \Gamma which is not contained in some disk graphs, but A(\Gamma) is a subgroup of the corresponding handlebody groups.
