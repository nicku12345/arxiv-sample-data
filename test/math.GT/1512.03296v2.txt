In this article, it is proved that the eigenvalue variety of the exterior of a nontrivial, non-Hopf, Brunnian link in \mathbb{S}^{3} contains a nontrivial component of maximal dimension. This generalises, for Brunnian links, the nontriviality of the A-polynomial of a nontrivial knot in \mathbb{S}^{3}.
