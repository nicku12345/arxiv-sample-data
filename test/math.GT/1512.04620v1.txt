In May 2015, a conference entitled "Groups, Geometry, and 3-manifolds" was held at the University of California, Berkeley. The organizers asked participants to suggest problems and open questions, related in some way to the subject of the conference. These have been collected here, roughly divided by topic. The name (or names) attached to each question is that of the proposer, though many of the questions have been asked before.
