Let C(2n, 3) be the family of two bridge knots of slope (4n+1)/(6n+1). We calculate the volumes of the C(2n, 3) cone-manifolds using the Schl\"{a}fli formula. We present the concrete and explicit formula of them. We apply the general instructions of Hilden, Lozano, and Montesinos-Amilibia and extend the Ham, Mednykh, and Petrov's methods. As an application, we give the volumes of the cyclic coverings over those knots. For the fundamental group of C( 2n, 3), we take and tailor Hoste and Shanahan's. As a byproduct, we give an affirmative answer for their question whether their presentation is actually derived from Schubert's canonical 2-bridge diagram or not.
