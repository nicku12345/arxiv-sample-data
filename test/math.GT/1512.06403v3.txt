Addressing a question going back to Gromov, we show that, for an open, contractible manifold M of dimension at least 6, the following conditions are equivalent:   - M admits a geodesically complete CAT(-1) metric;   - M admits a geodesically complete CAT(0) metric;   - M is pseudo-collarable;   - M can be collapsed.   By work of Guilbault, this implies that the CAT(-1) property of a contractible manifold is purely determined by the structure at infinity. It also yields many new contractible manifolds that admit CAT(-1) metrics, and demonstrates that contractible manifolds of the Whitehead type can never admit a complete CAT(-1) metric.
