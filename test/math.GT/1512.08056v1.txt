We study some properties of decomposable exact Lagrangian cobordisms between Legendrian links in \mathbb{R}^3 with the standard contact structure. In particular, for any decomposable exact Lagrangian filling L of a Legendrian link K, we may obtain a normal ruling of K associated with L. We prove that the associated normal rulings must have even number of clasps. As a result, we give a particular Legendrian (4,-(2n+5))-torus knot, for each n \geq 0, which does not have a decomposable exact Lagrangian filling because it has only 1 normal ruling and this normal ruling has odd number of clasps.
