We give explicit formulae for the volumes of hyperbolic cone-manifolds of double twist knots, a class of two-bridge knots which includes twist knots and two-bridge knots with Conway notation C(2n,3). We also study the Riley polynomial of a class of one-relator groups which includes two-bridge knot groups.
