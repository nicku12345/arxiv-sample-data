We study the convergence of earthquake paths and horocycle paths in the Gardiner-Masur compactification of Teichm\"uller space. We show that an earthquake path directed by a uniquely ergodic or simple closed measured geodesic lamination converges to the Gardiner-Masur boundary. Using the embedding of flat metrics into the space of geodesic currents, we prove that a horocycle path in Teichm\"uller space, induced by a quadratic differential whose vertical measured foliation is unique ergodic, converges to the Gardiner-Masur boundary and to the Thurston boundary.
