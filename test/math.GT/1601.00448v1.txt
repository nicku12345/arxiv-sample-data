Let M_n be a homology 3-sphere obtained by \frac1n-Dehn surgery along a (p,q)-torus knot. We consider a polynomial \sigma_{(p,q,n)}(t) whose zeros are the inverses of the Reideimeister torsion of M_n for \mathit{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})-irreducible representations. We give an explicit formula of this polynomial by using Tchebychev polynomials of the first kind. Further we also give a 3-term relations of these polynomials.
