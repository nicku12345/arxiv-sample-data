We calculate the Chern-Simons invariants of the hyperbolic orbifolds of the knot with Conway's notation C(2n, 3) using the Schl\"{a}fli formula for the generalized Chern-Simons function on the family of C(2n,3) cone-manifold structures. We present the concrete and explicit formula of them. We apply the general instructions of Hilden, Lozano, and Montesinos-Amilibia and extend the Ham and Lee's methods. As an application, we calculate the Chern-Simons invariants of cyclic coverings of the hyperbolic C(2n,3) orbifolds.
