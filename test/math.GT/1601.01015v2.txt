In this paper, we show that any non-arithmetic hyperbolic 2-bridge link complement admits no hidden symmetries. As a corollary, we conclude that a hyperbolic 2-bridge link complement cannot irregularly cover a hyperbolic 3-manifold. By combining this corollary with the work of Boileau and Weidmann, we obtain a characterization of 3-manifolds with non-trivial JSJ-decomposition and rank two fundamental groups. We also show that the only commensurable hyperbolic 2-bridge link complements are the figure-eight knot complement and the 6_{2}^{2} link complement. Our work requires a careful analysis of the tilings of \mathbb{R}^{2} that come from lifting the canonical triangulations of the cusps of hyperbolic 2-bridge link complements.
