A non-trivial slope r on a knot K in S^3 is called a characterizing slope if whenever the result of r-surgery on a knot K' is orientation preservingly homeomorphic to the result of r-surgery on K, then K' is isotopic to K. Ni and Zhang ask: for any hyperbolic knot K, is a slope r = p/q with |p| + |q| sufficiently large a characterizing slope? In this article we answer this question in the negative by demonstrating that there is a hyperbolic knot K in S^3 which has infinitely many non-characterizing slopes. As the simplest known example, the hyperbolic knot 8_6 has no integral characterizing slopes.
