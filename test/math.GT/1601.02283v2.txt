Let M be a smooth connected orientable closed surface and f_0\in C^\infty(M) a function having only critical points of the A_\mu-types, \mu\in\mathbb N. Let {\mathcal F}={\mathcal F}(f_0) be the set of functions f\in C^\infty(M) having the same types of local singularities as those of f_0. We describe the homotopy type of the space \mathcal F, endowed with the C^\infty-topology, and its decomposition into orbits of the action of the group of "left-right changings of coordinates".
