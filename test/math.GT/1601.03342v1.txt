Let S_{g,n} be a surface of genus g  with n marked points. Let X be a complete hyperbolic metric on S_{g,n} with n cusps. Every isotopy class [\gamma] of a closed curve \gamma \in \pi_{1}(S_{g,n}) contains a unique closed geodesic on X.   Let \ell_{\gamma}(X) denote the hyperbolic length of the geodesic representative of \gamma on X. In this paper, we study the asymptotic growth of the lengths of closed curves of a fixed topological type on S_{g,n}. As an application, one can obtain the asymptotics of the growth of s^{k}_{X}(L), the number of closed curves of length \leq L on X with at most k self-intersections. We also discuss properties of random pants decomposition of large length on X. Both these results are based on ergodic properties of the earthquake flow on a natural bundle over the moduli space \mathcal{M}_{g,n} of hyperbolic surfaces of genus g with n cusps.
