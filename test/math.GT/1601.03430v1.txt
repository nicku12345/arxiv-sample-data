(Original version of PhD thesis, submitted in Spring 2009 to Harvard University. Provides a solution of the p > k^2 case, corresponding to Berge families I-VI, of the "Lens space realization problem" later solved in entirety by Greene.) In the 1980's, Berge proved that a certain collection of knots in S^3 admitted lens space surgeries, a list which Gordon conjectured was exhaustive. More recently, J. Rasmussen used techniques from Heegaard Floer homology to translate the related problem of classifying simple knots in lens spaces admitting L-space homology sphere surgeries into a combinatorial number theory question about the data (p,q,k) associated to a knot of homology class k \in H_1(L(p,q)) in the lens space L(p,q). In the following paper, we solve this number theoretic problem in the case of p > k^2.
