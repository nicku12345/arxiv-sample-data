We define polynomial tangle invariants \nabla_T^s via Kauffman states and Alexander codes and investigate some of their properties. In particular, we prove symmetry relations for \nabla_T^s of 4-ended tangles and deduce that the multivariable Alexander polynomial is invariant under Conway mutation. The invariants \nabla_T^s can be interpreted naturally via Heegaard diagrams for tangles. This leads to a categorified version of \nabla_T^s: a Heegaard Floer homology \widehat{\operatorname{HFT}} for tangles, which we define as a bordered sutured invariant. We discuss a bigrading on \widehat{\operatorname{HFT}} and prove symmetry relations for \widehat{\operatorname{HFT}} of 4-ended tangles that echo those for \nabla_T^s.
