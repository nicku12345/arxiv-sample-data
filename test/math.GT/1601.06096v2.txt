Let N_{g} denote a closed nonorientable surface of genus g. For g \geq 2 the mapping class group \mathcal{M}(N_{g}) is generated by Dehn twists and one crosscap slide (Y-homeomorphism) or by Dehn twists and a crosscap transposition. Margalit and Schleimer observed that Dehn twists have nontrivial roots. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a root of a crosscap slide and a crosscap transposition.
