We introduce a notion of "quasi-right-veering" for closed braids, which plays an analogous role to "right-veering" for open books. We show that a transverse link K in a contact 3-manifold (M,\xi) is non-loose if and only if every braid representative of K with respect to every open book decomposition that supports (M,\xi) is quasi-right-veering. We also show that several definitions of "right-veering" closed braids are equivalent.
