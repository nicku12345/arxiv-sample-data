We prove a decomposition formula for twisted Blanchfield pairings of 3-manifolds. As an application we show that the twisted Blanchfield pairing of a 3-manifold obtained from a 3-manifold Y with a representation \phi: Z[\pi_1(Y)] \to R, infected by a knot J along a curve \eta with \phi(\eta) \neq 1, splits orthogonally as the sum of the twisted Blanchfield pairing of Y and the ordinary Blanchfield pairing of the knot J, with the latter tensored up from Z[t,t^{-1}] to R.
