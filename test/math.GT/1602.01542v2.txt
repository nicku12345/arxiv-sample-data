We present various examples of cosmetic bandings on knots and links, that is, bandings on knots and links leaving their types unchanged. As a byproduct, we give a hyperbolic knot which admits exotic chirally cosmetic surgeries yielding hyperbolic manifolds. This gives a counterexample to a conjecture raised by Bleiler, Hodgson and Weeks.
