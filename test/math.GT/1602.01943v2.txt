We classify compact oriented 5-manifolds with free fundamental group and \pi_{2} a torsion free abelian group in terms of the second homotopy group considered as \pi_1-module, the cup product on the second cohomology of the universal covering, and the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the universal covering. We apply this to the classification of simple boundary links of 3-spheres in S^5. Using this we give a complete algebraic picture of closed 5-manifolds with free fundamental group and trivial second homology group.
