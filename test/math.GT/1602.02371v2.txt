We consider the cosmetic surgery problem for two-bridge knots in the 3-sphere. It is seen that all the two-bridge knots at most 9 crossings other than 9_{27} = S(49,19)=C[2,2,-2,2,2,-2] admits no purely cosmetic surgery pairs. Then we show that any two-bridge knot of the Conway form [2x,2,-2x,2x,2,-2x] with x \ge 1 admits no cosmetic surgery pairs yielding homology 3-spheres, where 9_{27} appears for x=1. Our advantage to prove this is using the SL(2,\mathbb{C}) Casson invariant.
