The Jones polynomial V_{L}(t) for an oriented link L is a one-variable Laurent polynomial link invariant discovered by Jones. For any integer n\ge 3, we show that: (1) the difference of Jones polynomials for two oriented links which are C_{n}-equivalent is divisible by \left(t-1\right)^{n}\left(t^{2}+t+1\right)\left(t^{2}+1\right), and (2) there exists a pair of two oriented knots which are C_{n}-equivalent such that the difference of the Jones polynomials for them equals \left(t-1\right)^{n}\left(t^{2}+t+1\right)\left(t^{2}+1\right).
