In this paper, we give definitions of three kinds of minimal charts, and we investigate properties of minimal charts and establish fundamental theorems characterizing minimal charts. To classify charts with two or three crossings we use the fundamental theorems. In the future paper, we give an numeration of the charts with two crossings.
