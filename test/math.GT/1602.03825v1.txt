The first part of this article is a general introduction to the the theory of representation spaces of discrete groups into SL(n,C). Special attention is paid to knot groups. In Section 2 we discuss the difference between the tangent space at the representation variety, and the representation scheme. We give an example of Lubotzky and Magid of a non scheme reduced representation (see Example 2.18). In the second part recent results about the representation and character varieties of knot groups into SL(n,C) with n \ge 3 are presented. This second part concerns mostly joint work with L. Ben Abdelghani, O. Medjerab, V. Mu{\~n}os and J. Porti.
