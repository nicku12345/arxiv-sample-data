We define a Khovanov homotopy type for sl_2(\mathbb{C}) colored links and quantum spin networks and derive some of its basic properties. In the case of n-colored B-adequate links, we show a stabilization of the homotopy types as the coloring n\rightarrow\infty, generalizing the tail behavior of the colored Jones polynomial. Finally, we also provide an alternative, simpler stabilization in the case of the colored unknot.
