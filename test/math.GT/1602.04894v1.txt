In this paper, we describe the relation between the study of closed connected surfaces embedded in S^3 and the theory of handlebody-knots. By Fox's theorem, a pair of handlebody-knots is associated to a closed connected surface embedded in S^3 in the sense that their exterior components are pairwise homeomorphic. We show that for every handlebody-knot pair associated to a genus two "prime bi-knotted" surface, one is irreducible, and the other is reducible. Furthermore, for given two genus two handlebody-knots H_1 and H_2 satisfying certain conditions, we will construct a "prime bi-knotted" surface whose associated handlebody-knot pair coincides with H_1 and H_2.
