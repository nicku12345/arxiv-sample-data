A closed, orientable, splitting surface in an oriented 3-manifold is a topologically minimal surface of index n if its associated disk complex is (n-2)-connected but not (n-1)-connected. A critical surface is a topologically minimal surface of index 2. In this paper, we use an equivalent combinatorial definition of critical surfaces to construct the first known critical bridge spheres for nontrivial links.
