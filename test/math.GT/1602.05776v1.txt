For each surface S of genus g>2 we construct pairs of conjugate pseudo-Anosov maps, \varphi_1 and \varphi_2, and two non-equivalent covers p_i: \tilde S \longrightarrow S, i=1,2, so that the lift of \varphi_1 to \tilde S with respect to p_1 coincides with that of \varphi_2 with respect to p_2. The mapping tori of the \varphi_i and their lift provide examples of pairs of hyperbolic 3-manifolds so that the first is covered by the second in two different ways.
