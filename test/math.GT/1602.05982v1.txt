In [2], N.Dutertre and T. Fukui used Viro's integral calculus to study the topology of stable maps f:M\rightarrow N between two smooth manifolds M and N. They also discussed several applications to Morin maps. In particular, in Theorem 6.2 [2], they show an equality relating the Euler characteristic of a compact manifold M and the Euler characteristic of the singular sets of a Morin map defined on M.   In this paper we show how Morse theory for manifolds with boundary can be applied to the study of the singular sets of a Morin map in order to obtain a new proof of Dutertre-Fukui's Theorem when N=\mathbb{R}^n.
