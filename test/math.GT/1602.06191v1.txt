Ribbon tangles are proper embeddings of tori and cylinders in the 4-ball~B^4, "bounding" 3-manifolds with only ribbon disks as singularities. We construct an Alexander invariant \mathsf{A} of ribbon tangles equipped with a representation of the fundamental group of their exterior in a free abelian group G. This invariant induces a functor in a certain category \mathsf{R}ib_G of tangles, which restricts to the exterior powers of Burau-Gassner representation for ribbon braids, that are analogous to usual braids in this context. We define a circuit algebra \mathsf{C}ob_G over the operad of smooth cobordisms, inspired by diagrammatic planar algebras introduced by Jones, and prove that the invariant \mathsf{A} commutes with the compositions in this algebra. On the other hand, ribbon tangles admit diagrammatic representations, throught welded diagrams. We give a simple combinatorial description of \mathsf{A} and of the algebra \mathsf{C}ob_G, and observe that our construction is a topological incarnation of the Alexander invariant of Archibald. When restricted to diagrams without virtual crossings, \mathsf{A} provides a purely local description of the usual Alexander poynomial of links, and extends the construction by Bigelow, Cattabriga and the second author.
