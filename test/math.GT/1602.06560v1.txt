Let us denote by \mathcal K_n the hyperspace of all convex bodies of \mathbb R^n equipped with the Hausdorff distance topology. An affine invariant point p is a continuous and Aff(n)-equivariant map p:\mathcal K_n\to \mathbb R^n, where Aff(n) denotes the group of all nonsingular affine maps of \mathbb R^n. For every K\in\mathcal K_n, let \mathfrak{P}_n(K)=\{p(K)\in\mathbb R^n\mid p\text{ is an affine invariant point}\} and \mathfrak{F}_n(K)=\{x\in\mathbb R^n\mid gx=x\text{ for every }g\in Aff(n)\text{ such that }gK=K\}. In 1963, B. Gr\"unbaum conjectured that \mathfrak{P}_n(K)=\mathfrak{F}_n(K) . After some partial results, the conjecture was recently proven by O. Mordhorst. In this short note we give a rather different, simpler and shorter proof of this conjecture, based merely on the topology of the action of Aff(n) on \mathcal K_n.
