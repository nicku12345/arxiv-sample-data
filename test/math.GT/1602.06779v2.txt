Let f\colon M\to N be a proper map between two aspherical compact orientable 3-manifolds with empty or toroidal boundary. We assume that N is not a closed graph-manifold. Suppose that f induces an epimorphism on fundamental groups. We show that f is homotopic to a homeomorphism if one of the following holds: either for any finite-index subgroup \Gamma of \pi_1(N) the ranks of \Gamma and of f_*^{-1}(\Gamma) agree, or for any finite cover \tilde{N} of N the Heegaard genus of \tilde{N} and the Heegaard genus of the pull-back cover \tilde{M} agree.
