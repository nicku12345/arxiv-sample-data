In this paper we first present the construction of the new 2-variable classical link invariants arising from the Yokonuma-Hecke algebras {\rm Y}_{d,n}(q), which are not topologically equivalent to the Homflypt polynomial. We then present the algebra {\rm FTL}_{d,n}(q) which is the appropriate Temperley-Lieb analogue of {\rm Y}_{d,n}(q), as well as the related 1-variable classical link invariants, which in turn are not topologically equivalent to the Jones polynomial. Finally, we present the algebra of braids and ties which is related to the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra, and also its quotient, the partition Temperley-Lieb algebra {\rm PTL}_n(q) and we prove an isomorphism of this algebra with a subalgebra of {\rm FTL}_{d,n}(q).
