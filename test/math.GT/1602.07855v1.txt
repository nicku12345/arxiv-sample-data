We introduce the notion of a ribbon-clasp surface-link, which is a generalization of a ribbon surface-link. We generalize the notion of a normal form on embedded surface-links to the case of immersed surface-links and prove that any (immersed) surface-link can be described in a normal form. It is known that an embedded surface-link is a ribbon surface-link if and only if it can be described in a symmetric normal form. We prove that an (immersed) surface-link is a ribbon-clasp surface-link if and only if it can be described in a symmetric normal form. We also introduce the notion of a ribbon-clasp normal form, which is a simpler version of a symmetric normal form.
