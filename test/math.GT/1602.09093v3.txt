The mapping class group of a surface \S acts on the set of closed geodesics on \S. This action preserves self-intersection number. In this paper, we count the orbits of curves with at most K self-intersections, for each K \geq 1. (The case when K=0 is already known.) We also restrict our count to those orbits that contain geodesics of length at most L, for each L >0. This result complements a recent result of Mirzakhani, which gives the asymptotic growth of the number of closed geodesics of length at most L in a single mapping class group orbit. Furthermore, we develop a new, combinatorial approach to studying geodesics on surfaces, which should be of independent interest.
