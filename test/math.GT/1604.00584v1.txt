Extending Culler-Shalen theory, Hara and the second author presented a way to construct certain kinds of branched surfaces in a 3-manifold from an ideal point of a curve in the \operatorname{SL}_n-character variety. There exists an essential surface in some 3-manifold known to be not detected in the classical \operatorname{SL}_2-theory. We prove that every connected essential surface in a 3-manifold is given by an ideal point of a rational curve in the \operatorname{SL}_n-character variety for some n.
