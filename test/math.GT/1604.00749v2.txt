For any pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism on a closed orientable surface S of genus greater than one, it is known by the work of Bers and Thurston that the topological entropy agrees with the translation distance on the Teichm\"uller space with respect to the Teichm\"uller metric. In this paper, we consider random walks on the mapping class group of S. The drift of a random walk is defined as the translation distance of the random walk. We define the topological entropy of a random walk and prove that it almost surely agrees with the drift on the Teichm\"uller space with respect to the Teichm\"uller metric.
