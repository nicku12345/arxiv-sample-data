We study totally geodesic planes in hyperbolic 3-manifolds M having incompressible core and degenerate ends. We prove a Ratner-type phenomenon: a closed minimal PSL(2,R)-invariant subset of M is either an immersed totally geodesic surface or all of M. We also show that for an arbitrary infinite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold M without parabolics and with finitely generated fundamental group, the number of compact totally geodesic surfaces in M is finite.
