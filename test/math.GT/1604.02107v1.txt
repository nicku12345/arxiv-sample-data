We give a complete characterization of the topological slice status of odd 3-strand pretzel knots, proving that an odd 3-strand pretzel knot is topologically slice if and only if either it is ribbon or has trivial Alexander polynomial. (By work of [FS85], a nontrivial odd 3-strand pretzel knot K cannot both be ribbon and have \Delta_K(t)=1.) We also show that topologically slice even 3-strand pretzel knots (except perhaps for members of Lecuona's exceptional family of [Lec13]) must be ribbon. These results follow from computations of the Casson-Gordon 3-manifold signature invariants associated to the double branched covers of these knots.
