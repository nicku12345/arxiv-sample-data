The coarse category was established by Roe to distill the salient features of the large-scale approach to metric spaces and groups that was started by Gromov. In this paper, we use the language of coarse spaces to define coarse versions of asymptotic property C and decomposition complexity. We prove that coarse property C implies coarse property A; we also show that these coarse versions share many of the features of their metric analogs such as preservation by products or unions.
