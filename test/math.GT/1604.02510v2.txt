We revisit the issue of the existence of infinitely many distinct prime knots with the same Alexander invariant. We present infinitely many distinct families, each family made up of infinitely many distinct knots. Within each family, the Alexander invariant is the same. Unlike other examples in the literature, ours are elementary and based on a sub-collection of pretzel knots with three tassels.
