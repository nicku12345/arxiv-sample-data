The Turaev genus defines a natural filtration on knots where Turaev genus zero knots are precisely the alternating knots. We show that the signature of a Turaev genus one knot is determined by the number of components in its all-A Kauffman state, the number of positive crossings, and its determinant. We also show that either the leading or trailing coefficient of the Jones polynomial of a Turaev genus one link (or an almost alternating link) has absolute value one.
