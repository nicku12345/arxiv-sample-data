We show that there exists a \mathbb{Z}^\infty-summand in the subgroup of the knot concordance group generated by knots with trivial Alexander polynomial. To this end we use the invariant Upsilon \Upsilon recently introduced by Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz and Szab\'o using knot Floer homology. We partially compute \Upsilon of (n,1)-cable of the Whitehead double of the trefoil knot. For this computation of \Upsilon, we determine a sufficient condition for two satellite knots to have identical \Upsilon for any pattern with nonzero winding number.
