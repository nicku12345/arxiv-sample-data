Let \beta:=\sigma_1\sigma_2^{-1} be a braid in B_3, where B_3 is the braid group on 3 strings and \sigma_1, \sigma_2 are the standard Artin generators. We use Gauss diagram formulas to show that for each natural number n not divisible by 3 the knot which is represented by the closure of the braid \beta^n is algebraically slice if and only if n is odd. As a consequence, we deduce some properties of Lucas numbers.
