In this paper, we study the behavior of \Upsilon_K(t) under the cabling operation, where \Upsilon_K(t) is the knot concordance invariant defined by Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o, associated to a knot K\subset S^3. The main result is an inequality relating \Upsilon_K(t) and \Upsilon_{K_{p,q}}(t), which generalizes the inequalities of Hedden and Van Cott on the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o \tau-invariant. As applications, we give a computation of \Upsilon_{(T_{2,-3})_{2,2n+1}}(t) for n\geq 8, and we also show that the set of iterated (p,1)-cables of Wh^{+}(T_{2,3}) for any p\geq 2 span an infinite-rank summand of topologically slice knots.
