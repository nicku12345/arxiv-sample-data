Let {a,b} and {c,d} be two pairs of bounding simple closed curves on an oriented surface which intersect nontrivialy. We prove that if these pairs are invariant under the action of an orientation reversing involution, then the corresponding bounding pair maps generate a free group. This supports the conjecture stated by C. Leininger and D. Margalit that any pair of elements of the Torelli group either commute or generate a free group.
