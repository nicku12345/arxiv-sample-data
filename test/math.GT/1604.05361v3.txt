Any two knots admit orientation preserving homeomorphic Seifert surfaces, as can be seen by stabilizing. There is a generalization of a Seifert surface to the setting of links called a C-complex. In this paper, we ask when two links will admit orientation preserving homeomorphic C-complexes. In the case of 2-component links, we find that the pairwise linking number provides a complete obstruction. In the case of links with 3 or more components and zero pairwise linking number, Milnor's triple linking number provides a complete obstruction.
