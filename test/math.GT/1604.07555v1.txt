In this paper, we introduce an equivalence relation on the set of local moves and classify local moves, called the extended ST-moves, up to the equivalence. Moreover, by inducing a binary relation on the set of equivalence classes of local moves, we show that an extended ST-move realizes the crossing change or the SH(2)-move. In addition, for any oriented knot and two extended ST-moves, we disscus the magnitude relation between the unknotting numbers of the knot via the moves, and show that there is an extended ST-move except SH-moves so that the knot can be transformed into the trivial knot by the single extended ST-move. Finally, we provide some examples of ST-moves with the binary relation.
