We determine the Thurston's geometry possesed by any Seifert fibered conemanifold structure in a Seifert manifold with orbit space S^2 and no more than three exceptional fibres, whose singular set, composed by fibres, has at most 3 components which can include exceptional or general fibres (the total number of exceptional and singular fibres is less or equal than three). We also give the method to obtain the holonomy of that structure. We apply these results to three families of Seifert manifolds, namely, spherical, Nil manifolds and manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery in a torus knot K_{(r,s)}. As a consequence we generalize to all torus knots the results obtained in \cite{LM2015} for the case of the left handle trefoil knot. We associate a plot to each torus knot for the different geometries, in the spirit of Thurston.
