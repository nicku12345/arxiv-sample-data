Let D be a diagram of an alternating knot with unknotting number one. The branched double cover of S^3 branched over D is an L-space obtained by half integral surgery on a knot K_D. We denote the set of all such knots K_D by \mathcal D. We characterize when K_D\in \mathcal D is a torus knot, a satellite knot or a hyperbolic knot. In a different direction, we show that for a given n>0, there are only finitely many L-space knots in \mathcal D with genus less than n.
