The problem of which Gauss diagram can be realized by knots is an old one and has been solved in several ways. In this paper, we present a direct approach to this problem. We show that the needed conditions for realizability of a Gauss diagram can be interpreted as follows "the number of exits = the number of entrances" and the sufficient condition is based on Jordan curve Theorem.
