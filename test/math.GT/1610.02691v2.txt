We extend the Kamada-Miyazawa polynomial to virtual singular links, which is valued in \mathbb{Z}[A^2, A^{-2}, h]. The decomposition of the resulting polynomial into two components, one in \mathbb{Z}[A^2, A^{-2}] and the other in \mathbb{Z}[A^2, A^{-2}]h yields the decomposition of the Kauffman-Jones polynomial of virtual singular links into two components, one in \mathbb{Z}[A^2, A^{-2}] and the other in \mathbb{Z}[A^2, A^{-2}]A^2, where both components are invariants for virtual singular links.
