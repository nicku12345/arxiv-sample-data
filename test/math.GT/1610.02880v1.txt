Any generalized distance-squared mapping of equidimensional case has singularities, and their singularity types are wrapped into mystery in higher dimensional cases. Any generalized distance-squared mapping of equidimensional case is not injective. Nevertheless, in this paper, it is shown that the non-singular property or the injective property of a mapping is preserved by composing a generic generalized distance-squared mapping of equidimensional case.
