We generalize three invariants, first discovered by A. Henrich, to the long and/or framed virtual knot case. These invariants are all finite-type invariants of order one, and include a universal one. The generalization will require us to extend the notion of a based matrix of a virtual string, first introduced by V. Turaev and later generalized by Henrich, to the long and framed cases.
