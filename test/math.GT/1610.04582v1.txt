We show that the limiting Khovanov chain complex of any infinite positive braid categorifies the Jones-Wenzl projector. This result extends Lev Rozansky's categorification of the Jones-Wenzl projectors using the limiting complex of infinite torus braids. We also show a similar result for the limiting Lipshitz-Sarkar-Khovanov homotopy types of the closures of such braids. Extensions to more general infinite braids are also considered.
