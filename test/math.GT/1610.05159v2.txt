Let \Gamma be a finitely generated group and G a real form of \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C}). We propose a definition for the G-character variety of \Gamma as a subset of the \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C})-character variety of \Gamma. We consider two anti-holomorphic involutions of the \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C}) character variety and show that an irreducible representation with character fixed by one of them is conjugate to a representation taking values in a real form of \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C}). We study in detail an example: the \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{C}), \mathrm{SU}(2,1) and \mathrm{SU}(3) character varieties of the free product \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}.
