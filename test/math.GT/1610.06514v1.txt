Przytycki has shown that the size \mathcal{N}_{k}(S) of a maximal collection of simple closed curves that pairwise intersect at most k times on a topological surface S grows at most as a polynomial in |\chi(S)| of degree k^{2}+k+1. In this paper, we narrow Przytycki's bounds by showing that  \mathcal{N}_{k}(S) =O \left( \frac{ |\chi|^{3k}}{ ( \log |\chi| )^2 } \right) ,  In particular, the size of a maximal 1-system grows sub-cubically in |\chi(S)|. The proof uses a circle packing argument of Aougab-Souto and a bound for the number of curves of length at most L on a hyperbolic surface. When the genus g is fixed and the number of punctures n grows, we can improve our estimates using a different argument to give  \mathcal{N}_{k}(S) \leq O(n^{2k+2}) .  Using similar techniques, we also obtain the sharp estimate \mathcal{N}_{2}(S)=\Theta(n^3) when k=2 and g is fixed.
