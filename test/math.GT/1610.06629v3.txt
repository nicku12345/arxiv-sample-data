If X is an orientable, strongly minimal PD_4-complex and \pi_1(X) has one end then it has no nontrivial locally-finite normal subgroup. Hence if \pi is a 2-knot group then (a) if \pi is virtually solvable then either \pi has two ends or \pi\cong\Phi, with presentation \langle{a,t}|ta=a^2t\rangle, or \pi is torsion-free and polycyclic of Hirsch length 4; (b) either \pi has two ends, or \pi has one end and the centre \zeta\pi is torsion-free, or \pi has infinitely many ends and \zeta\pi is finite; and (c) the Hirsch-Plotkin radical \sqrt\pi is nilpotent.
