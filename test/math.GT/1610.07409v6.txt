We study the geometry of the Thurston metric on the Teichm\"uller space \mathcal{T}(S) of hyperbolic structures on a surface S. Some of our results on the coarse geometry of this metric apply to arbitrary surfaces S of finite type; however, we focus particular attention on the case where the surface is a once-punctured torus, S_{1,1}. In that case, our results provide a detailed picture of the infinitesimal, local, and global behavior of the geodesics of the Thurston metric, as well as an analogue of Royden's theorem.
