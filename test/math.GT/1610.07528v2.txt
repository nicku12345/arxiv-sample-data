We use the geometry of the Farey graph to give an alternative proof of the fact that if A \in GL_2\mathbb Z and G_A=\mathbb Z^2 \rtimes_A \mathbb Z is generated by two elements, there is a single Nielsen equivalence class of 2-element generating sets for G_A unless A is conjugate to \pm \left(\begin {smallmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end {smallmatrix}\right ), in which case there are two.
