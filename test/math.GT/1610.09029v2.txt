We show that a decorated knot concordance \mathcal{C} from K_0 to K_1 induces an \mathbb{F}[U]-module homomorphism \[G_{\mathcal{C}}: HFK^{-}(-S^3,K_0) \to HFK^{-}(-S^3,K_1)\] which preserves the Alexander and absolute \mathbb{Z}_2-Maslov gradings. Our construction generalizes the concordance maps induced on \widehat{HFK} studied by Juh\'asz and Marengon, but uses the description of HFK^{-} as a direct limit of maps between sutured Floer homology groups discovered by Etnyre, Vela-Vick, and Zarev.
