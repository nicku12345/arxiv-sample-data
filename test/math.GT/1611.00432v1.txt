We discuss how the global geometry and topology of manifolds depend on different group actions of their fundamental groups, and in particular, how properties of a non-trivial compact 4-dimensional cobordism M whose interior has a complete hyperbolic structure depend on properties of the variety of discrete representations of the fundamental group of its 3-dimensional boundary \partial M. In addition to the standard conformal ergodic action of a uniform hyperbolic lattice on the round sphere S^{n-1} and its quasiconformal deformations in S^n, we present several constructions of unusual actions of such lattices on everywhere wild spheres (boundaries of quasisymmetric embeddings of the closed n-ball into S^n), on non-trivial (n-1)-knots in S^{n+1}, as well as actions defining non-trivial compact cobordisms with complete hyperbolic structures in its interiors. We show that such unusual actions always correspond to discrete representations of a given hyperbolic lattice from "non-standard" components of its varieties of representations (faithful or with large kernels of defining homomorphisms).
