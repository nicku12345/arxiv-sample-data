In this paper we prove that for all n=4k-2, k\ge2 there exists a closed smooth complex hyperbolic manifold M with real dimension n having non-trivial \pi_1(\mathcal{T}^{<0}(M)). \mathcal{T}^{<0}(M) denotes the Teichm\"uller space of all negatively curved Riemannian metrics on M, which is the topological quotient of the space of all negatively curved metrics modulo the space of self-diffeomorphisms of M that are homotopic to the identity.
