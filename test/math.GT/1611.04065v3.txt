In a previous paper, V\'ertesi and the first author used grid-like Heegaard diagrams to define tangle Floer homology, which associates to a tangle T a differential graded bimodule \widetilde{\mathrm{CT}} (T). If L is obtained by gluing together T_1, \dotsc, T_m, then the knot Floer homology \hat{\mathrm{HFK}}(L) of L can be recovered from \widetilde{\mathrm{CT}} (T_1), \dotsc, \widetilde{\mathrm{CT}} (T_m). In the present paper, we prove combinatorially that tangle Floer homology satisfies unoriented and oriented skein relations, generalizing the skein exact triangles for knot Floer homology.
