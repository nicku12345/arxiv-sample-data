We construct, for m\geq 6 and 2n\leq m, closed manifolds M^{m} with finite nonzero \varphi(M^{m},S^{n}), where \varphi(M,N) denotes the minimum number of critical points of a smooth map M\to N. We also give some explicit families of examples for even m\geq 6, n=3, taking advantage of the Lie group structure on S^3. Moreover, there are infinitely many such examples with \varphi(M^{m},S^{n})=1. Eventually we compute the signature of the manifolds M^{2n} occurring for even n.
