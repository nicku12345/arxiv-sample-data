We introduce invariants of Hurwitz equivalence classes with respect to arbitrary group G. The invariants are constructed from any right G-modules M and any G-invariant bilinear function on M, and are of bilinear forms. For instance, when G is the mapping class group of the closed surface, \mathcal{M}_g, we get an invariant of 4-dimensional Lefschetz fibrations over the 2-sphere. Moreover, the construction is applicable for the quantum representations of \mathcal{M}_g  derived from Chern-Simons field theory. We compute the associated invariants in some cases, and find infinitely many Lefschetz fibrations which have the same Seiberg-Witten invariant and are homeomorphic but not mutually isomorphic as fibrations.
