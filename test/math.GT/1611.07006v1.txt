Using computational techniques we tabulate prime knots up to five crossings in the solid torus and the infinite family of lens spaces L(p,q). For these knots we calculate the second and third skein module and establish which prime knots in the solid torus are amphichiral. Most knots are distinguished by the skein modules. For the handful of cases where the skein modules fail to detect inequivalent knots, we calculate and compare the hyperbolic structures of the knot complements. We were unable to resolve a handful of 5-crossing cases for p\geq 13.
