We show that if the connected sum of two knots with coprime Alexander polynomials is doubly slice, then the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o correction terms as smooth double sliceness obstructions vanish for both knots. Recently, Jeffrey Meier gave smoothly slice knots that are topologically doubly slice, but not smoothly doubly slice. As an application, we give a new example of such knots that is distinct from Meier's knots modulo doubly slice knots.
