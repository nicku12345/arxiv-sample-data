For an orientable surface S of finite topological type with genus g \geq 3, we construct a finite set of curves whose union of iterated rigid expansions is the curve graph of S. The set constructed, and the method of rigid expansion, are closely related to Aramayona and Leiniger's finite rigid set, and in fact a consequence of our proof is that Aramayona and Leininger's set also exhausts the curve graph via rigid expansions.
