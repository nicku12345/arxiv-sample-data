Suppose S_{1} and S_{2} are orientable surfaces of finite topological type such that S_{1} has genus at least 3 and the complexity of S_{1} is an upper bound of the complexity of S_{2}. Let \varphi : \mathcal{C}(S_{1}) \rightarrow \mathcal{C}(S_{2}) be an edge-preserving map; then S_{1} is homeomorphic to S_{2}, and in fact \varphi is induced by a homeomorphism. To prove this, we use several simplicial properties of rigid expansions, which we prove here.
