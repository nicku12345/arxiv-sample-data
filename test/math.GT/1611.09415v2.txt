Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o used the knot filtration on \widehat{CF}(S^3) to define the \tau-invariant for knots in the 3-sphere. In this article, we generalize their construction and define a collection of \tau-invariants associated to a knot K in a rational homology sphere Y. We then show that some of these invariants provide lower bounds for the genus of a surface with boundary K properly embedded in a negative definite 4-manifold with boundary Y..
