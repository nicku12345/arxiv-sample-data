Let S_{1} and S_{2} be connected orientable surfaces of genus g_{1}, g_{2} \geq 3, n_{1},n_{2} \geq 0 punctures, and empty boundary. Let also \varphi: \mathcal{HT}(S_{1}) \rightarrow \mathcal{HT}(S_{2}) be an edge-preserving alternating map between their Hatcher-Thurston graphs. We prove that g_{1} \leq g_{2} and that there is also a multicurve of cardinality g_{2} - g_{1} contained in every element of the image. We also prove that if n_{1} = 0 and g_{1} = g_{2}, then the map \widetilde{\varphi} obtained by filling the punctures of S_{2}, is induced by a homeomorphism of S_{1}.
