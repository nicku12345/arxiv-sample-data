This paper proves that every oriented non-disk Seifert surface F for a knot K in S^3 is smoothly concordant to a Seifert surface F^{\prime} for a hyperbolic knot K^{\prime} of arbitrarily large volume. This gives a new and simpler proof of the result of Friedl and of Kawauchi that every knot is S-equivalent to a hyperbolic knot of arbitrarily large volume. The construction also gives a new and simpler proof of the result of Silver and Whitten and of Kawauchi that for every knot K there is a hyperbolic knot K^{\prime} of arbitrarily large volume and a map of pairs f:(S^3,K^{\prime})\rightarrow (S^3,K) which induces an epimorphism on the knot groups. An example is given which shows that knot Floer homology is not an invariant of Seifert surface concordance. The paper also proves that a set of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds with unbounded Haken numbers has unbounded volumes.
