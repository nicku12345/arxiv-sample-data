We give a new, elementary proof that Khovanov homology with \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}--coefficients is invariant under Conway mutation. This proof also gives a strategy to prove Baldwin and Levine's conjecture that \delta--graded knot Floer homology is mutation--invariant. Using the Clifford module structure on \widetilde{\text{HFK}} induced by basepoint maps, we carry out this strategy for mutations on a large class of tangles. Let L' be a link obtained from L by mutating the tangle T. Suppose some rational closure of T corresponding to the mutation is the unlink on any number of components. Then L and L' have isomorphic \delta--graded \widehat{\text{HFK}}-groups over \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} as well as isomorphic Khovanov homology over \mathbb{Q}. We apply these results to establish mutation--invariance for the infinite families of Kinoshita-Terasaka and Conway knots. Finally, we give sufficient conditions for a general Khovanov-Floer theory to be mutation--invariant.
