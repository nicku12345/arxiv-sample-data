In this paper we investigate the unlinking numbers of 10-crossing links. We make use of various link invariants and explore their behaviour when crossings are changed. The methods we describe have been used previously to compute unlinking numbers of links with crossing number at most 9. Ultimately, we find the unlinking numbers of all but 2 of the 287 prime, non-split links with crossing number 10.
