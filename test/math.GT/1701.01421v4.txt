Let K be a tunnel number one knot in M, where M is either S^3, S^2\times S^1, or a connected sum of S^2\times S^1 with a lens space. We prove that if a Dehn surgery on K yields a lens space, then K is a doubly primitive knot in M. For M = S^3 this resolves the tunnel number one Berge Conjecture. For M = S^2\times S^1 this resolves a conjecture of Greene and Baker-Buck-Lecuona for tunnel number one knots.
