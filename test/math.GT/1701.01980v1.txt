In this note we study the Seifert rational homology spheres with two complementary legs, i.e. with a pair of invariants whose fractions add up to one. We give a complete classification of the Seifert manifolds with 3 exceptional fibers and two complementary legs which bound rational homology balls. The result translates in a statement on the sliceness of some Montesinos knots.
