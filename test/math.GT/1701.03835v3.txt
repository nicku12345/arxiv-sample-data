A twisted torus knot is a knot obtained from a torus knot by twisting adjacent strands by full twists. The twisted torus knots lie in F, the genus 2 Heegaard surface for S^3. Primitive/primitive and primitive/Seifert knots lie in F in a particular way. Dean gives sufficient conditions for the parameters of the twisted torus knots to ensure they are primitive/primitive or primitive/Seifert. Using Dean's conditions, Doleshal shows that there are infinitely many twisted torus knots that are fibered and that there are twisted torus knots with distinct primitive/Seifert representatives with the same slope in F. In this paper, we extend Doleshal's results to show there is a four parameter family of positive twisted torus knots. Additionally, we provide new examples of twisted torus knots with distinct representatives with the same surface slope in F.
