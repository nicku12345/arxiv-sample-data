In the Khovanov homology of links, presence of \mathbb{Z}_2-torsion is a very common phenomenon. Finite number of examples of knots with \mathbb{Z}_n-torsion for n>2 were also known, none for n>8. In this paper, we prove that there are infinite families of links whose Khovanov homology contains \mathbb{Z}_n-torsion for 2 < n < 9 and \mathbb{Z}_{2^s}-torsion for s < 24. We also introduce 4-braid links with \mathbb{Z}_3-torsion which are counterexamples to the PS braid conjecture. We also provide an infinite family of knots with \mathbb{Z}_5-torsion in reduced Khovanov homology and \mathbb{Z}_3-torsion in odd Khovanov homology.
