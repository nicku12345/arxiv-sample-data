In this paper we present in a topological way the construction of the orientable surface with only one end and infinite genus, called \emph{The Infinite Loch Ness Monster}. In fact, we introduce a flat and hyperbolic construction of this surface. We discuss how the name of this surface has evolved and how it has been historically understood.
