We study small Seifert possibly chiral cosmetic surgeries on not necessarily null-homologous knot in rational homology spheres. Using PSL_2(\mathbb{C})-character variety theory we give a sharp bound on the number of slopes producing the same small Seifert manifold if the ambient manifold satisfies some representation theoretic conditions.
