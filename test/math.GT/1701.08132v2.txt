We introduce subgroups {\mathcal{B}}_g< {\mathcal H}_g of the mapping class group Mod(\Sigma_g) of a closed surface of genus g \ge 0 with a Cantor set removed, which are extensions of Thompson's group V by a direct limit of mapping class groups of compact surfaces of genus g.   We first show that both {\mathcal{B}}_g and {\mathcal H}_g are finitely presented, and that {\mathcal H}_g is dense in Mod(\Sigma_g). We then exploit the relation with Thompson's groups to study properties {\mathcal B}_g and {\mathcal H}_g in analogy with known facts about finite-type mapping class groups. For instance, their homology coincides with the stable homology of the mapping class group of genus g, every automorphism is geometric, and every homomorphism from a higher-rank lattice has finite image.   In addition, the same connection with Thompson's groups will also prove that {\mathcal B}_g and {\mathcal H}_g are not linear and do not have Kazhdan's Property (T), which represents a departure from the current knowledge about finite-type mapping class groups.
