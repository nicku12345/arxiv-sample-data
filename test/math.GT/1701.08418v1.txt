We introduce a Kauffman-Jones type polynomial \mathcal{L}_{\gamma}(A) for a curve \gamma on an oriented surface, whose endpoints are on the boundary of the surface. The polynomial \mathcal{L}_{\gamma}(A) is a Laurent polynomial in one variable A and is an invariant of the homotopy class of \gamma. As an application, we obtain an estimate in terms of the span of \mathcal{L}_{\gamma}(A) for the minimum self-intersection number of a curve within its homotopy class. We then give a chord diagrammatic description of \mathcal{L}_{\gamma}(A) and show some computational results on the span of \mathcal{L}_{\gamma}(A).
