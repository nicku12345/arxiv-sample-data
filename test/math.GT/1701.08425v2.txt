In this note, we complete the classification of quasi-alternating Montesinos links. We show that the quasi-alternating Montesinos links are precisely those identified independently by Qazaqzeh-Chbili-Qublan and Champanerkar-Ording. A consequence of our proof is that a Montesinos link L is quasi-alternating if and only if its double branched cover is an L-space, and bounds both a positive definite and a negative definite 4-manifold with vanishing first homology.
