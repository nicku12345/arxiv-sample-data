We introduce a multiple conjugation biquandle, and show that it is the universal algebra to define a semi-arc coloring invariant for handlebody-links. A multiple conjugation biquandle is a generalization of a multiple conjugation quandle. We extend the notion of n-parallel biquandle operations for any integer n, and show that any biquandle gives a multiple conjugation biquandle with them.
