In this work we study the decomposability property of branched coverings of degree d odd, over the projective plane, where the covering surface has Euler characteristic \leq 0. The latter condition is equivalent to say that the defect of the covering is greater than d. We show that, given a datum \mathscr{D}=\{D_{1},\dots,D_{s}\} with an even defect greater than d, it is realizable by an indecomposable branched covering over the projective plane. The case when d is even is known.
