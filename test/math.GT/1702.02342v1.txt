In [Tohoku Math. J. 62 (2010), 45--53] the second author showed that, except for a few cases, the order N of a cyclic group of self-homeomorphisms of a closed orientable topological surface S_g of genus g \geq 2 determines the group up to a topological conjugation, provided that N\geq 3g. The first author et al. undertook in [Collect. Math. 67 (2016), 415--429] a more general problem of topological classification of such group actions for N>2(g-1). In [Rev. R. Acad. Cienc. Exactas Fis. Nat., Ser. A. Mat. (RACSAM) 110 (2016), 303--320] we considered the analogous problem for closed non-orientable surfaces, and in [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 220 (2016) 465--481] - the problem of classification of cyclic actions generated by an orientation reversing self-homeomorphism. The present paper, in which we deal with topological classification of actions on bordered surfaces of finite cyclic groups of order N>p-1, where p is the algebraic genus of the surface, completes our project of topological classification of "large" cyclic actions on compact surfaces. We apply obtained results to solve the problem of uniqueness of the actions realising the solutions of the so called minimum genus and maximum order problems for bordered surfaces.
