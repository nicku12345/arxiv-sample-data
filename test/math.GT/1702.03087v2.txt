The symmetries of surfaces which can be embedded into the symmetries of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^3 are easier to feel by human's intuition. We give the maximum order of finite group actions on (\mathbb{R}^3, \Sigma) among all possible embedded closed/bordered surfaces with given geometric/algebraic genus >1 in \mathbb{R}^3. We also identify the topological types of the bordered surfaces realizing the maximum order, and find simple representative embeddings for such surfaces.
