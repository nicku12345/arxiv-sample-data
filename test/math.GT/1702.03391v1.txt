S. Nelson, M. Orrison, V. Rivera {\cite{S}} modified Kauffman's construction of bracket. Their invariant \Phi^{\beta}_X takes value in a finite ring Z_2[t]/(1+t+t^3). In this paper, the author generalizes this invariant. The new invariant takes value in a polynomial ring. Furthermore, for a tricolorable link diagram, the author gives a bracket invariant which gives lower bound on number of crossings with different (same) colors.
