Let n, q and r be positive integers, and let K_N^n be the n-skeleton of an (N-1)-simplex. We show that for N sufficiently large every embedding of K_N^n in \mathbb{R}^{2n+1} contains a link L_1\cup\cdots\cup L_r consisting of r disjoint n-spheres, such that the linking number link(L_i,L_j) is a nonzero multiple of q for all i\neq j. This result is new in the classical case n=1 (graphs embedded in \mathbb{R}^3) as well as the higher dimensional cases n\geq 2; and since it implies the existence of a link L_1\cup\cdots\cup L_r such that |link(L_i,L_j)|\geq q for all i\neq j, it also extends a result of Flapan et al. from n=1 to higher dimensions. Additionally, for r=2 we obtain an improved upper bound on the number of vertices required to force a two-component link L_1\cup L_2 such that link(L_1,L_2) is a nonzero multiple of q. Our new bound has growth O(nq^2), in contrast to the previous bound of growth O(\sqrt{n}4^nq^{n+2}).
