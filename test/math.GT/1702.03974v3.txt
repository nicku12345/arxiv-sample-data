We give a method for constructing many pairs of distinct knots K_0 and K_1 such that the two 4-manifolds obtained by attaching a 2-handle to B^4 along K_i with framing zero are diffeomorphic. We use the d-invariants of Heegaard Floer homology to obstruct the smooth concordance of some of these K_0 and K_1, thereby disproving a conjecture of Abe in [Abe16]. As a consequence, we obtain a proof that there exist patterns P in solid tori such that P(K) is not always concordant to P(U) \# K and yet whose action on the smooth concordance group is invertible.
