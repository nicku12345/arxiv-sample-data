The manifold which admits a genus-2 reducible Heegaard splitting is one of the 3-sphere, \mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1, lens spaces and their connected sums. For each of those manifolds except most lens spaces, the mapping class group of the genus-2 splitting was shown to be finitely presented. In this work, we study the remaining generic lens spaces, and show that the mapping class group of the genus-2 Heegaard splitting is finitely presented for any lens space by giving its explicit presentation. As an application, we show that the fundamental groups of the spaces of the genus-2 Heegaard splittings of lens spaces are all finitely presented.
