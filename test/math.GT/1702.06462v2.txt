In this paper we introduce the concept of a space-efficient knot mosaic. That is, we seek to determine how to create knot mosaics using the least number of non-blank tiles necessary to depict the knot. This least number is called the tile number of the knot. We determine strict bounds for the tile number of a knot in terms of the mosaic number of the knot. In particular, if t is the tile number of a prime knot with mosaic number m, then 5m-8 \leq t \leq m^2-4 if m is even and 5m-8 \leq t \leq m^2-8 if m is odd. We also determine the tile number of several knots and provide space-efficient knot mosaics for each of them.
