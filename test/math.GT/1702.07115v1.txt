An open book decomposition of a 3-manifold M induces a Heegaard splitting for M, and the minimal genus among all Heegaard splittings induced by open book decompositions is called the \emph{open book genus} of M. It is conjectured by Ozbagci \cite{O} that the open book genus is additive under the connected sum of 3-manifolds. In this paper, we prove that a non-prime 3-manifold which has open book genus 2 is homeomorphic to L(p,1)\#L(q,1) for some integers p,q\neq\pm1, that is, it has non-trivial prime pieces of open book genus 1. In particular, there cannot be a counter-example to additivity of the open book genus such that the connected sum has open book genus 2.
