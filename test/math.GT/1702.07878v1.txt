A knot complement admits a pseudo-hyperbolic structure by solving Thurston's gluing equations for an octahedral decomposition. It is known that a solution to these equations can be described in terms of region variables, also called w-variables. In this paper, we consider the case when pinched octahedra appear as a boundary parabolic solution in the decomposition. A w-solution with pinched octahedra induces a solution for a new knot obtained by changing the crossing or inserting a tangle at the pinched place. We discuss this phenomenon with corresponding holonomy representations and give some examples including ones obtained from connected sum.
