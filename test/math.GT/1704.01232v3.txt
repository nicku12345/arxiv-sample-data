This is the first step of the two steps to enumerate the minimal charts with two crossings. For a label m of a chart \Gamma we denote by \Gamma_m the union of all the edges of label m and their vertices. For a minimal chart \Gamma with exactly two crossings, we can show that the two crossings are contained in \Gamma_\alpha\cap\Gamma_\beta for some labels \alpha<\beta. In this paper, we study the structure of a disk D not containing any crossing but satisfying \Gamma\cap \partial D\subset\Gamma_{\alpha+1}\cup \Gamma_{\beta-1}.
