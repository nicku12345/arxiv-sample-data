For the alternating knots or links, mutations do not change the arc index. In the case of nonalternating knots, some semi-alternating knots or links have this property. We mainly focus on the problem of mutation invariance of the arc index for nonalternating knots which are not semi-alternating. In this paper, we found families of infinitely many mutant pairs/triples of Montesinos knots with the same arc index.
