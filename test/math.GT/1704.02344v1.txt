We examine the conjecture, due to Champanerkar, Kofman, and Purcell that \text{vol}(K) < 2 \pi \log \det (K) for alternating hyperbolic links, where \text{vol}(K) = \text{vol}(S^3\backslash K) is the hyperbolic volume and \det(K) is the determinant of K. We prove that the conjecture holds for 2-bridge links, alternating 3-braids, and various other infinite families. We show the conjecture holds for highly twisted links and quantify this by showing the conjecture holds when the crossing number of K exceeds some function of the twist number of K.
