We compute different versions of link Floer homology HFL^{-} and \widehat{HFL} for any L-space link with two components. The main approach is to compute the h-function of the filtered chain complex which is determined by the Alexander polynomials of every sublink of the L-space link. As an application, Thurston polytope and Thurston norm of any 2-component L-space link are explicitly determined by Alexander polynomials of the link and the link components.
