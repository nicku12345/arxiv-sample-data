In this paper we provide a classification of fundamental group elements representing simple closed curves on the punctured Klein bottle, Similar to the Birman-Series classification of curves on the punctured torus[1]. In the process, an explicit description of the mapping class group is given. We then apply this to give a counterexample the simple loop conjecture for representations from the Klein bottle group to PGL(2,R).
