It is well known that an arbitrary closed orientable 3-manifold can be realized as the unique boundary of a compact orientable 4-manifold, that is, any closed orientable 3-manifold is cobordant to zero. In this paper, we consider the geometric cobordism problem: a hyperbolic 3-manifold is geometrically bounding if it is the only boundary of a totally geodesic hyperbolic 4-manifold. However, there are very rare geometrically bounding closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds according to the previous research [11,13]. Let v \approx 4.3062\ldots be the volume of the regular right-angled hyperbolic dodecahedron in \mathbb{H}^{3}, for each n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+} and each odd integer k in [1,5n+3], we construct a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M with \beta^1(M)=k and vol(M)=16nv that bounds a totally geodesic hyperbolic 4-manifold. The proof uses small cover theory over a sequence of linearly-glued dodecahedra and some results of Kolpakov-Martelli-Tschantz [9].
