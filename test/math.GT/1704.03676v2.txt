The mixed braid groups B_{2,n}, \ n \in \mathbb{N}, with two fixed strands and n moving ones, are known to be related to the knot theory of certain families of 3-manifolds. In this paper we define the mixed Hecke algebra \mathrm{H}_{2,n}(q) as the quotient of the group algebra {\mathbb Z}\, [q^{\pm 1}] \, B_{2,n} over the quadratic relations of the classical Iwahori-Hecke algebra for the braiding generators. We furhter provide a potential basis \Lambda_n for \mathrm{H}_{2,n}(q), which we prove is a spanning set for the \mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm 1}]-additive structure of this algebra. The sets \Lambda_n,\ n \in \mathbb{Z} appear to be good candidates for an inductive basis suitable for the construction of Homflypt-type invariants for knots and links in the above 3-manifolds.
