Let PB_n(S_{g,p}) be the pure braid group of a genus g>1 surface with p punctures. In this paper we prove that any surjective homomorphism PB_n(S_{g,p})\to PB_m(S_{g,p}) factors through one of the forgetful homomorphisms. We then compute the automorphism group of PB_n(S_{g,p}), extending Irmak, Ivanov and McCarthy's result to the punctured case. Surprisingly, in contrast to the n=1 case, any automorphism of PB_n(S_{g,p}), n>1 is geometric.
