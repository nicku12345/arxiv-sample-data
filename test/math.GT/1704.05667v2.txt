We show that the reduced quantum hyperbolic invariants of pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms of punctured surfaces are intertwiners of local representations of the quantum Teichm\"uller spaces. We characterize them as the only intertwiners that satisfy certain natural cut-and-paste operations of topological quantum field theories and such that their traces define invariants of mapping tori.
