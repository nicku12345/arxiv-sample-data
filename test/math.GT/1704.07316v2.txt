Based on the results of the second author, we define an equivariant version of Lee and Bar-Natan homology for periodic links and show that there exists an equivariant spectral sequence from the equivariant Khovanov homology to equivariant Lee homology. As a result we obtain new obstructions for a link to be periodic. These obstructions generalize previous results of Przytycki and of the second author.
