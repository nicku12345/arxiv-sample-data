We give a formula of the connected component decomposition of the Alexander quandle: \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm1}]/(f_1(t),\ldots, f_k(t))=\bigsqcup^{a-1}_{i=0}\mathrm{Orb}(i), where a=\gcd (f_1(1),\ldots, f_k(1)). We show that the connected component \mathrm{Orb}(i) is isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm1}]/J with an explicit ideal J. By using this, we see how a quandle is decomposed into connected components for some Alexander quandles. We introduce a decomposition of a quandle into the disjoint union of maximal connected subquandles. In some cases, this decomposition is obtained by iterating a connected component decomposition. We also discuss the maximal connected sub-multiple conjugation quandle decomposition.
