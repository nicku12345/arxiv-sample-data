The simplicial volume of oriented closed connected smooth manifolds that admit a non-trivial smooth S^1-action vanishes. In the present work we prove a version of this result for the integral foliated simplicial volume of aspherical manifolds: The integral foliated simplicial volume of aspherical oriented closed connected smooth manifolds that admit a non-trivial smooth S^1-action vanishes. Our proof uses the geometric construction of Yano's proof for ordinary simplicial volume as well as the parametrised uniform boundary condition for S^1.
