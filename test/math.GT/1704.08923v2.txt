An (m,n)-branched twist spin is a fibered 2-knot in S^4 which is determined by a 1-knot K and coprime integers m and n. For a 1-knot, Lin proved that the number of irreducible SL(2,\mathbb{C})-metabelian representations of the knot group of a 1-knot up to conjugation is determined by the knot determinant of the 1-knot. In this paper, we prove that the number of irreducible SL(2,\mathbb{C})-metabelian representations of the knot group of an (m,n)-branched twist spin up to conjugation is determined by the determinant of a 1-knot in the orbit space by comparing a presentation of the knot group of the branched twist spin with the Lin's presentation of the knot group of the 1-knot.
