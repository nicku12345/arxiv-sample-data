Kricker defined an invariant of knots in homology 3-spheres which is a rational lift of the Kontsevich integral, and proved with Garoufalidis that this invariant satisfies splitting formulas with respect to a surgery move called null-move. We define a functorial extension of the Kricker invariant and prove splitting formulas for this functorial invariant with respect to null Lagrangian-preserving surgery, a generalization of the null-move. We apply these splitting formulas to the Kricker invariant.
