Given a connect sum of link diagrams, there is an isomorphism which decomposes unnormalized Khovanov chain groups for the product in terms of normalized chain groups for the factors; this isomorphism is straightforward to see on the level of chains. Similarly, any plumbing x*y of Kauffman states carries an isomorphism of the chain subgroups generated by the enhancements of x*y, x, y:   \[   \mathcal{C}_R(x*y)\to   \left(\mathcal{C}_{R,p\to1}(x)\otimes \mathcal{C}_{R,p\to1}(y)\right)\oplus\left(\mathcal{C}_{R,p\to0}(x)\otimes \mathcal{C}_{R,p\to0}(y)\right). \] We apply this plumbing of chains to to prove that every homogeneously adequate state has enhancements X^\pm in distinct j-gradings whose A-traces (which we define) represent nonzero Khovanov homology classes over \mathbb{F}_2, and that this is also true over \mathbb{Z} when all A-blocks' state surfaces are two-sided. We construct X^\pm explicitly.
