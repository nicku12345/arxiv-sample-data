\begin{abstract} The reduced Burau representation is a natural action of the braid group B_n on the first homology group H_1({\tilde{D}}_n;\mathbb{Z}) of a suitable infinite cyclic covering space {\tilde{D}}_n of the n--punctured disc D_n. It is known that the Burau representation is faithful for n\le 3 and that it is not faithful for n\ge 5. We use forks and noodles homological techniques and Bokut--Vesnin generators to analyze the problem for n=4. We present a Conjecture implying faithfulness and a Lemma explaining the implication. We give some arguments suggesting why we expect the Conjecture to be true. Also, we give some geometrically calculated examples and information about data gathered using a C\texttt{++} program.
