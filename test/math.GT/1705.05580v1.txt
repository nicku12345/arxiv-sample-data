Extended welded links are a generalization of Fenn, Rim\'{a}nyi, and Rourke's welded links. Their braided counterpart are extended welded braids, which are closely related to ribbon braids and loop braids. In this paper we prove versions of Alexander and Markov's theorems for extended welded braids and links, following Kamada's approach to the case of welded objects.
