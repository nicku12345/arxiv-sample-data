We relate some terms on the boundary of the Newton polygon of the Alexander polynomial \Delta(x,y) of a rational link to the number and length of monochromatic twist sites in a particular diagram that we call the standard form. Normalize \Delta(x,y) so that no x^{-1} or y^{-1} terms appear, but x^{-1}\Delta(x,y) and y^{-1}\Delta(x,y) have negative exponents, and so that terms of even total degree are positive and terms with odd total degree are negative. If the rational link has a reduced alternating diagram with no self crossings, then \Delta(-1, 0) = 1. If the standard form of the rational link has m monochromatic twist sites, and the j^{\textrm{th}} monochromatic twist site has \hat{q}_j crossings, then \Delta(-1, 0) = \prod_{j=1}^{m}(\hat{q}_j+1). Our proof employs Kauffman's clock moves and a lattice for the terms of \Delta(x,y) in which the y-power cannot decrease.
