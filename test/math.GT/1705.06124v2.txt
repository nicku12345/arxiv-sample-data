We survey the problem of separation under conjugacy and malnormality of the abelian peripheral subgroups of an orientable, irreducible 3-manifold X. We shall focus on the relation between this problem and the existence of acylindrical splittings of \pi_1(X) as an amalgamated product or HNN-extension along the abelian subgroups corresponding to the JSJ-tori.
