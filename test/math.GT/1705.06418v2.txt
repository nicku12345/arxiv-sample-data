We analyze all monodromies of genus one fibered knots that possess clean or once-unclean arcs, and use this to determine all manifolds containing genus one fibered knots with generalized crossing changes resulting in another genus one fibered knot, and classify all such generalized crossing changes between two genus one, fibered knots.
