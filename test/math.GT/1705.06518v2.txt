We consider complex projective structures on Riemann surfaces and their groups of projective automorphisms. We show that the structures achieving the maximal possible number of projective automorphisms allowed by their genus are precisely the Fuchsian uniformizations of Hurwitz surfaces by hyperbolic metrics. More generally we show that Galois Bely\u{\i} curves are precisely those Riemann surfaces for which the Fuchsian uniformization is the unique complex projective structure invariant under the full group of biholomorphisms.
