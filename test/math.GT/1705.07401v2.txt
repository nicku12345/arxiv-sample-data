We consider partial matchings, which are finite graphs consisting of edges and vertices of degree zero or one. We consider transformations between two states of partial matchings. We introduce a method of presenting a transformation between partial matchings. We introduce the notion of the lattice presentation of a partial matching, and the lattice polytope associated with a pair of lattice presentations, and we investigate transformations with minimal area.
