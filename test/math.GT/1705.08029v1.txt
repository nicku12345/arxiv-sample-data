A natural class of coloring complexes X on closed manifold M^n is investigated that gives a holonomy map \mbox{Hol}_X: \pi_1(M) \to S_{n+1}. By a k-multilayer complex construction the holonomy map may be defined to any finite permutation group   \mbox{Hol}_X: \pi_1(M) \to S_{n+k}, k>0. Under isotopy of X and surgery on B^n \subset M^n a holonomy class of complexes [X] is defined with [X]=[Y] \iff \mbox{Hol}_X = \mbox{Hol}_Y. It is also shown that for any homeomorphism f:\pi_1(M) \to S_{n+1} there is a complex X on M with \mbox{Hol}_X =f. These results are applied to express the 4-color Theorem and the Poincar\'e Conjecture as the existence and uniqueness, respectively, of a certain holonomy class. Several other applications are suggested.
