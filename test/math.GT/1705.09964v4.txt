We establish a relation between the "large r" asymptotics of the Turaev-Viro invariants TV_r and the Gromov norm of 3-manifolds. We show that for any orientable, compact 3-manifold M, with (possibly empty) toroidal boundary, \log |TV_r (M)| is bounded above by a function linear in r and whose slope is a positive universal constant times the Gromov norm of M. The proof combines TQFT techniques, geometric decomposition theory of 3-manifolds and analytical estimates of 6j-symbols.   We obtain topological criteria that can be used to check whether the growth is actually exponential; that is one has \log| TV_r (M)|\geqslant B \ r, for some B>0. We use these criteria to construct infinite families of hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose SO(3) Turaev-Viro invariants grow exponentially. These constructions are essential for the results of [DK:AMU] where the authors make progress on a conjecture of Andersen, Masbaum and Ueno about the geometric properties of surface mapping class groups detected by the quantum representations.   We also study the behavior of the Turaev-Viro invariants under cutting and gluing of 3-manifolds along tori. In particular, we show that, like the Gromov norm, the values of the invariants do not increase under Dehn filling and we give applications of this result on the question of the extent to which relations between the invariants TV_r and hyperbolic volume are preserved under Dehn filling.   Finally we give constructions of 3-manifolds, both with zero and non-zero Gromov norm, for which the Turaev-Viro invariants determine the Gromov norm.
