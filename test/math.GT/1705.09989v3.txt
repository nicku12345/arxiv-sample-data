For embedded 2-spheres in a 4-manifold sharing the same embedded transverse sphere homotopy implies isotopy, provided the ambient 4-manifold has no \BZ_2-torsion in the fundamental group. This gives a generalization of the classical light bulb trick to 4-dimensions, the uniqueness of spanning discs for a simple closed curve in S^4 and \pi_0(\Diff_0(S^2\times D^2)/\Diff_0(B^4))=1. In manifolds with \BZ_2-torsion, one surface can be put into a normal form relative to the other.
