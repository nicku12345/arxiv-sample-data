Twisting a knot K in S^3 along a disjoint unknot c produces a twist family of knots \{K_n\} indexed by the integers. Comparing the behaviors of the Seifert genus g(K_n) and the slice genus g_4(K_n) under twistings, we prove that if g(K_n) - g_4(K_n) < C for some constant C for infinitely many integers n > 0 or g(K_n) / g_4(K_n) \to 1 as n \to \infty, then either the winding number of K about c is zero or the winding number equals the wrapping number. As a key application, if \{K_n\} or the mirror twist family \{\overline{K_n}\} contains infinitely many tight fibered knots, then the latter must occur. We further develop this to show that c is a braid axis of K if and only if both \{K_n\} and \{\overline{K_n}\} each contain infinitely many tight fibered knots. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for \{ K_n \} to contain infinitely many L-space knots, and show (modulo a conjecture) that satellite L-space knots are braided satellites.
