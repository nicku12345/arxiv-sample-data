We present explicit algorithms for simplifying the topology of indefinite fibrations on 4-manifolds, which include broken Lefschetz fibrations and indefinite Morse 2-functions. The algorithms consist of sequences of moves, which modify indefinite fibrations in smooth 1-parameter families. In particular, given an arbitrary broken Lefschetz fibration, we show how to turn it to one with directed and embedded round (indefinite fold) image, and to one with all the fibers and the round locus connected. We also show how to realize any given null-homologous 1-dimensional submanifold with prescribed local models for its components as the round locus of such a broken Lefschetz fibration. These algorithms allow us to give purely topological and constructive proofs of the existence of simplified broken Lefschetz fibrations and Morse 2-functions on general 4-manifolds, and a theorem of Auroux-Donaldson-Katzarkov on the existence of broken Lefschetz pencils with directed embedded round image on near-symplectic 4-manifolds. We moreover establish a correspondence between broken Lefschetz fibrations and Gay-Kirby trisections of 4-manifolds, and show the existence of simplified trisections on all 4-manifolds. Building on this correspondence, we provide several new constructions of trisections, including infinite families of genus-3 trisections with homotopy inequivalent total spaces, and exotic same genera trisections of 4-manifolds in the homeomorphism classes of complex rational surfaces.
