We study chirally cosmetic surgeries, that is, a pair of Dehn surgeries on a knot producing homeomorphic 3-manifolds with opposite orientations. Several constraints on knots and surgery slopes to admit such surgeries are given. Our main ingredients are the original and the SL(2,\mathbb{C}) version of Casson invariants. As applications, we give a complete classification of chirally cosmetic surgeries on alternating knots of genus one.
