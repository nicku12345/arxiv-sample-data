We use classical techniques to answer some questions raised by Daniele Celoria about almost-concordance of knots in arbitrary closed 3-manifolds. We first prove that, given Y^3 \neq S^3, for any non-trivial element g\in \pi_1(Y) there are infinitely many distinct smooth almost-concordance classes in the free homotopy class of the unknot. In particular we consider these distinct smooth almost-concordance classes on the boundary of a Mazur manifold and we show none of these distinct classes bounds a PL-disk in the Mazur manifold, but all the representatives we construct are topologically slice. We also prove that all knots in the free homotopy class of S^1 \times pt in S^1 \times S^2 are smoothly concordant.
