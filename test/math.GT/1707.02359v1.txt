In this paper, we investigate simultaneous properties of a convex integrand \gamma and its dual \delta. The main results are the following three.   (1) For a C^\infty convex integrand \gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+, its dual convex integrand \delta: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ is of class C^\infty if and only if \gamma is a strictly convex integrand.   (2) Let \gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ be a C^\infty strictly convex integrand. Then, \gamma is stable if and only if its dual convex integrand \delta: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ is stable.   (3) Let \gamma: S^n\to \mathbb{R}_+ be a C^\infty strictly convex integrand. Suppose that \gamma is stable. Then, for any i (0\le i\le n), a point \theta_0\in S^n is a non-degenerate critical point of \gamma with Morse index i if and only if its antipodal point -\theta_0\in S^n is a non-degenerate critical point of the dual convex integrand \delta with Morse index (n-i).
