We consider branched coverings which are simple in the sense that any point of the target has at most one singular preimage. The cobordism classes of k-fold simple branched coverings between n-manifolds form an abelian group Cob^1(n,k). Moreover, Cob^1(*,k) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty} Cob^1(n,k) is a module over \Omega^{SO}_*. We construct a universal k-fold simple branched covering, and use it to compute this module rationally. As a corollary, we determine the rank of the groups Cob^1(n,k). In the case n = 2 we compute the group Cob^1(2,k), give a complete set of invariants and construct generators.
