Given a flexible n-gon with generic side lengths, the moduli space of its configurations in \mathbb{R}^2 as well as in \mathbb{R}^3 is a smooth manifold. It is equipped with n \textit{tautological} line bundles whose definition is motivated by M. Kontsevich's tautological bundles over \mathcal{M}_{0,n}. We study their Euler classes, first Chern classes and intersection numbers, that is, top monomials in Chern (Euler) classes. The latter are interpreted geometrically as the signed numbers of some \textit{triangular configurations} of the flexible polygon.
