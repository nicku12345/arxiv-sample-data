We establish a relationship between the knot symmetries and the automorphisms of the knot quandle. We identify the homeomorphisms of the pair (S^{3},K) that induce the (anti)automorphisms of the fundamental quandle Q(K). We show that every quandle (anti)automorphism of Q(K) is induced by a homeomorphism of the pair (S^{3},K). As an application of those results, we are able to explore some symmetry properties of a knot based on the presentation of its fundamental quandle, which is easily derived from a knot diagram.
