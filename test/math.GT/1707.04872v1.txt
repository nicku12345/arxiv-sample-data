We prove that loose Legendrian knots in a rational homology contact 3-sphere, satisfying some additional hypothesis, are Legendrian isotopic if and only if they have the same classical invariants. The proof requires a result of Dymara on loose Legendrian knots and Eliashberg's classification of overtwisted contact structures on 3-manifolds.
