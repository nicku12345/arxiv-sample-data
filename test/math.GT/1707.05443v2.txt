A link is almost alternating if it is non-alternating and has a diagram that can be transformed into an alternating diagram via one crossing change. We give formulas for the first two and last two potential coefficients of the Jones polynomial of an almost alternating link. Using these formulas, we show that the Jones polynomial of an almost alternating link is nontrivial. We also show that either the first two or last two coefficients of the Jones polynomial of an almost alternating link alternate in sign. Finally, we describe conditions that ensure an almost alternating diagram has the fewest number of crossings among all almost alternating diagrams of the link.
