Let M be a hyperbolic fibered 3-manifold with b_1(M) \geq 2 and let S be a fiber with pseudo-Anosov monodromy \psi. We show that there exists a sequence (R_n, \psi_n) of fibers and monodromies contained in the fibered cone of (S,\psi) such that the asymptotic translation length of \psi_n on the curve complex \mathcal{C}(R_n) behaves asymptotically like 1/|\chi(R_n)|^2. As applications, we can reprove the previous result by Gadre--Tsai that the minimal asymptotic translation length of a closed surface of genus g asymptotically behaves like 1/g^2. We also show that this also holds for the cases of hyperelliptic mapping class group and hyperelliptic handlebody group.
