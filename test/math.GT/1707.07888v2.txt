A branched covering surface-knot over an oriented surface-knot F is a surface-knot in the form of a branched covering over F. A branched covering surface-knot over F is presented by a graph called a chart on a surface diagram of F. For a branched covering surface-knot, an addition of 1-handles equipped with chart loops is a simplifying operation which deforms the chart to the form of the union of free edges and 1-handles with chart loops. We investigate properties of such simplifications.
