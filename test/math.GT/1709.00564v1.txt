A virtual n-string is a chord diagram with n core circles and a collection of arrows between core circles. We consider virtual n-strings up to virtual homotopy, compositions of flat virtual Reidemeister moves on chord diagrams.   Given a virtual 1-string \alpha, Turaev associated a based matrix that encodes invariants of the virtual homotopy class of \alpha. We generalize Turaev's method to associate a multistring based matrix to virtual n-strings, addressing an open problem of Turaev and constructing similar invariants for virtual homotopy classes of virtual n-strings.
