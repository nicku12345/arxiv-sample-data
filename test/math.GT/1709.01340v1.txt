A virtual n-string \alpha is a collection of n oriented smooth generic loops on a surface M. A stabilization of \alpha is a surgery that results in attaching a handle to M along disks avoiding \alpha, and the inverse operation is a destabilization of \alpha. We consider virtual n-strings up to virtual homotopy, i.e., sequences of stabilizations, destabilizations, and homotopies of \alpha.   Recently, Cahn proved that any virtual 1-string can be virtually homotoped to a genus-minimal and crossing-minimal representative by monotonically decreasing both genus and the number of self-intersections. We generalize her result to the case of connected non-parallel n-strings.   Cahn also proved that any two crossing-irreducible representatives of a virtual 1-string are related by Type 3 moves, stabilizations, and destabilizations. Kadokami claimed that this held for virtual n-strings in general, but Gibson found a counterexample for 5-strings. We show that Kadokami's statement holds for connected non-parallel n-strings and exhibit a counterexample for 3-strings.
