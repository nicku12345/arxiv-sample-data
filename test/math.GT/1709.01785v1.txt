Solving tangle equations is deeply connected with studying enzyme action on DNA. The main goal of this paper is to solve the system of tangle equations N(O+X_1)=b_1 and N(O+X_2)=b_2 \# b_3, where X_1 and X_2 are rational tangles, and b_i is a 2-bridge link, for i=1,2,3, with b_2 and b_3 nontrivial. We solve this system of equations under the assumption \widetilde{O}, the double branched cover of O, is not hyperbolic, i.e.O is not \pi-hyperbolic. Besides, we also deal with tangle equations involving 2-bridge links only under the assumption O is an algebraic tangle.
