We prove that the cardinality of the torsion subgroups in homology of a closed hyperbolic manifold of any dimension can be bounded by a doubly exponential function of its diameter. It would follow from a conjecture by Bergeron and Venkatesh that the order of growth in our bound is sharp.   We also determine how the number of non-commensurable closed hyperbolic manifolds of dimension at least 3 and bounded diameter grows. The lower bound implies that the fraction of arithmetic manifolds tends to zero as the diameter goes up.
