The Brieskorn manifolds B(p,q,r) are the r-fold cyclic coverings of the 3-sphere S^{3} branched over the torus knot T(p,q). The generalised Sieradski groups S(m,p,q) are groups with m-cyclic pre\-sen\-tation G_{m}(w), where defining word w has a special form, depending of p and q. In particular, S(m,3,2) = G_{m}(w) is the group with m generators x_{1}, \ldots, x_{m} and m defining relations w(x_{i}, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2})=1, where w(x_{i}, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}) = x_{i} x_{i+2} x_{i+1}^{-1}. Presentations of S(2n,3,2) in a certain form G_{n}(w) were investigated by Howie and Williams. They proved that the n-cyclic presentations are geometric, i.e., correspond to the spines of closed orientable 3-manifolds. We establish an analogous result for the groups S(2n,5,2). It is shown that in both cases the manifolds are n-fold cyclic branched coverings of lens spaces. To classify some of constructed manifolds we used the Matveev's computer program "Recognizer".
