In this paper, we first give a new simple proof to the elimination theorem of definite fold by homotopy for generic smooth maps of manifolds of dimension strictly greater than 2 into the 2--sphere or into the real projective plane. Our new proof has the advantage that it is not only constructive, but is also algorithmic: the procedures enable us to construct various explicit examples. We also study simple stable maps of 3--manifolds into the 2--sphere without definite fold. Furthermore, we prove the non-existence of singular Legendre fibrations on 3--manifolds, answering negatively to a question posed in our previous paper.
