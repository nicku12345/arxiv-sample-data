In this article, we investigate the cobordism maps on periodic Floer homology (PFH). In the first part of the paper, we define the cobordism maps on PFH via Seiberg Witten theory as well as the isomorphism between PFH and Seiberg Witten cohomology. Furthermore, we show that the maps satisfy the holomorphic curve axiom. In the second part of the paper, we give an alternative definition of these maps by using holomorphic curve method, provided that the symplectic cobordisms are Lefschetz fibration satisfying certain nice conditions. Under additionally certain monotonicity assumptions, we show that these two definitions are equivalent.
