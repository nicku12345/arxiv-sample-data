We study the minimal crossing number c(K_{1}\# K_{2}) of composite knots K_{1}\# K_{2}, where K_1 and K_2 are prime, by relating it to the minimal crossing number of spatial graphs, in particular the 2n-theta curve \theta_{K_{1},K_{2}}^n that results from tying n of the edges of the planar embedding of the 2n-theta graph into K_1 and the remaining n edges into K_2. We prove that for large enough n we have c(\theta_{K_1,K_2}^n)=n(c(K_1)+c(K_2)). We also formulate additional relations between the crossing numbers of certain spatial graphs that, if satisfied, imply the additivity of the crossing number or at least give a lower bound for c(K_1\# K_2).
