For a given knot, we study the minimal number of positive eigenvalues of the double branched cover over spanning surfaces for the knot. The value gives a lower bound for various genera, the dealternating number and the alternation number of knots, and we prove that Batson's bound for the non-orientable 4-genus gives an estimate of the value. In addition, we use the value to give a necessary condition for being quasi-alternating.
