We study the family \Omega^1(-1^s) of rational 1--forms on the Riemann sphere, having exactly -s \leq -2 simple poles. Three equivalent (2s-1)--dimensional complex atlases on \Omega^1(-1^s), using coefficients, zeros--poles and residues--poles of the 1--forms, are recognized. A rational 1--form is isochronous when all their residues are purely imaginary. We prove that the subfamily \mathcal{RI}\Omega^1(-1^s) of isochronous 1--forms is a (3s-1)--dimensional real analytic submanifold in the complex manifold \Omega^1(-1^s). The complex Lie group PSL(2,\mathbb{C}) acts holomorphically on \Omega^1(-1^s). For s \geq 3, the PSL(2,\mathbb{C})--action is proper on \Omega^1(-1^s) and \mathcal{RI}\Omega^1(-1^s). Therefore, the quotients \Omega^1(-1^s)/PSL(2,\mathbb{C}) and \mathcal{RI}\Omega^1(-1^s)/PSL(2,\mathbb{C}) admit a stratification by orbit types. Using an explicit set of PSL(2,\mathbb{C})--invariant functions, we give realizations for the quotients \Omega^1(-1^s)/PSL(2,\mathbb{C}) and \mathcal{RI}\Omega^1(-1^s)/PSL(2,\mathbb{C}).
