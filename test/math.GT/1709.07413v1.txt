Let {\mathfrak M} be a closed, orientable, hyperbolic 3-orbifold whose singular set is a link, and such that \pi_1({\mathfrak M}) contains no hyperbolic triangle group. We show that if the underlying manifold |{\mathfrak M}| is irreducible, and |{\mathfrak M}| is irreducible for every two-sheeted (orbifold) covering \widetilde{\mathfrak M} of {\mathfrak M}, and if {\rm vol} {\mathfrak M}\le1.72, then \dim H_1({\mathfrak M};{\mathbb Z}_2)\le 15. Furthermore, if {\rm vol} {\mathfrak M}\le1.22 then \dim H_1({\mathfrak M};{\mathbb Z}_2)\le 11, and if {\rm vol} {\mathfrak M}\le0.61 then \dim H_1({\mathfrak M};{\mathbb Z}_2)\le 7. The proof is an application of results that will be used in the sequel to this paper to obtain qualitatively similar results without the assumption of irreducibility of |{\mathfrak M}| and |\widetilde{\mathfrak M}|.
