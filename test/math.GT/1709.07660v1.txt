Let \Gamma be the fundamental group of a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold M with toric cusps. We define the \omega-Borel invariant \beta_n^\omega(\rho_\omega) associated to a representation \rho_\omega: \Gamma \rightarrow SL(n,\mathbb{C}_\omega), where \mathbb{C}_\omega is a field which can be constructed as a quotient of a suitable subset of \mathbb{C}^\mathbb{N} with the data of a non-principal ultrafilter \omega on \mathbb{N} and a real divergent sequence \lambda_l such that \lambda_l \geq 1. Since a sequence of \omega-bounded representations \rho_l into SL(n,\mathbb{C}) determines a representation \rho_\omega into SL(n,\mathbb{C}_\omega), for n=2 we study the relation between the invariant \beta^\omega_2(\rho_\omega) and the sequence of Borel invariants \beta_2(\rho_l). We conclude by showing that if a sequence of representations \rho_l:\Gamma \rightarrow SL(2,\mathbb{C}) induces a representation \rho_\omega:\Gamma \rightarrow SL(2,\mathbb{C}_\omega) which determines a reducible action on the asymptotic cone C_\omega(\mathbb{H}^3,d/\lambda_l,O) with non-trivial length function, then it holds \beta^\omega_2(\rho_\omega)=0.
