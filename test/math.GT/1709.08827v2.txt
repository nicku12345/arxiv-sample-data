Given a 2-crossing minimal chart \Gamma, a minimal chart with two crossings, set \alpha=\min\{~i~|~there exists an edge of label i containing a white vertex\}, and \beta=\max\{~i~|~there exists an edge of label i containing a white vertex\}. In this paper we study the structure of a neighbourhood of \Gamma_\alpha\cup\Gamma_\beta, and propose a normal form for 2-crossing minimal n-charts, here \Gamma_\alpha and \Gamma_\beta mean the union of all the edges of label \alpha and \beta respectively.
