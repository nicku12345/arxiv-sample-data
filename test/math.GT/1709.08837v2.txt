A flat plumbing basket is a surface consisting a disk and finitely many bands which are contained in distinct pages of the trivial open book decomposition of \mathbf{S}^{3}. In this paper, we construct a Legendrian link from a flat plumbing basket, and we describe a relation among the self-linking number, the Thurston-Bennequin number and the flat plumbing basket number of the link. As a corollary, we determine the flat plumbing basket numbers of torus links.
