Let M_n be the topological moduli space of all parallel n-cables of long framed oriented knots in 3-space. We construct in a combinatorial way for each natural number n>1 a 1-cocycle R_n which represents a non trivial class in H^1(M_n; \mathbb{Z} [x_1,x_2,...,x_1^{-1},x_2^{-1},...]), where the number of variables x_m depends on n. To each generic point in M_n we associate in a canonical way an arc {\em scan} in M_n, such that R_n(scan) is already a polynomial knot invariant. We show that R_3(scan) detects the non-invertibility of the knot 8_{17} in a very simple way and without using the knot group.   There are two well-known canonical loops in M_n for each parallel n-cable of a long framed knot K: Gramain's loop {\em rot} and the Fox-Hatcher loop {\em fh}. The calculation of R_n is of at most quartic complexity for these loops with respect to the number of crossings of K for each fixed n. It follows from results of Hatcher that K is not a torus knot if the rational function R_n(fh(K))/R_n(rot(K)) is not constant for each n>1.    \oplus_n R_n is a natural candidate in order to separate all classes in H_1(M_1;\mathbb{Q}) \cong H_1(M_n;\mathbb{Q}), and in particular to distinguish all knot types \pi_0(M_1).
