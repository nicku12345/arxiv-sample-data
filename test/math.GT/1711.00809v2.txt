We use Nathanson's g-adic representation of integers to relate metric properties of Cayley graphs of the integers with respect to various infinite generating sets S to problems in additive number theory. If S consists of all powers of a fixed integer g, we find explicit formulas for the smallest positive integer of a given length. This is related to finding the smallest positive integer expressible as a fixed number of sums and differences of powers of g. We also consider S to be the set of all powers of all primes and bound the diameter of Cayley graph by relating it to Goldbach's conjecture.
