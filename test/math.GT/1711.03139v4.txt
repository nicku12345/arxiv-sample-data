We produce new cohomology for non-uniform arithmetic lattices \Gamma<SO(p,q) using a technique of Millson--Raghunathan. From this, we obtain new characteristic classes of manifold bundles with fiber a closed 4k-dimensional manifold M with indefinite intersection form of signature (p,q). These classes are defined on a finite cover of BDiff(M) and are shown to be nontrivial for M=\#_g(S^{2k}\times S^{2k}). In this case, the classes produced live in degree g and are independent from the algebra generated by the stable (i.e. MMM) classes. We also give an application to bundles with fiber a K3 surface.
