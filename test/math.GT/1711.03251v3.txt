Andersen, Masbaum and Ueno conjectured that certain quantum representations of surface mapping class groups should send pseudo-Anosov mapping classes to elements of infinite order (for large enough level r). In this paper, we relate the AMU conjecture to a question about the growth of the Turaev-Viro invariants TV_r of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We show that if the r-growth of |TV_r(M)| for a hyperbolic 3-manifold M that fibers over the circle is exponential, then the monodromy of the fibration of M satisfies the AMU conjecture. Building on earlier work \cite{DK} we give broad constructions of (oriented) hyperbolic fibered links, of arbitrarily high genus, whose SO(3)-Turaev-Viro invariants have exponential r-growth. As a result, for any g>n\geqslant 2, we obtain infinite families of non-conjugate pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, acting on surfaces of genus g and n boundary components, that satisfy the AMU conjecture.   We also discuss integrality properties of the traces of quantum representations and we answer a question of Chen and Yang about Turaev-Viro invariants of torus links.
