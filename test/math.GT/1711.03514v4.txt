We use Kirk's invariant of link maps S^2\sqcup S^2\to S^4 and its variations due to Koschorke and Kirk-Livingston to deduce results about classical links. Namely, we give a new proof of the Nakanishi-Ohyama classification of two-component links in S^3 up to \Delta-link homotopy. We also prove its version for string links, which is due (in a slightly different form) to Fleming-Yasuhara. The proofs do not use Clasper Theory.
