A stable smooth map f:N\to M is called "k-realizable" if its composition with the inclusion M\subset M\times\Bbb R^k is C^0-approximable by smooth embeddings; and a "k-prem" if the same composition is C^\infty-approximable by smooth embeddings, or equivalently if f lifts vertically to a smooth embedding N\to M\times\Bbb R^k.   It is obvious that if f is a k-prem, then it is k-realizable. We refute the long-standing conjecture that the converse is always true. Namely, for each n=4k+3\ge 15 there exists a stable smooth immersion S^n\to\Bbb R^{2n-7} that is 3-realizable but is not a 3-prem.   We also prove the converse in a wide range of cases. A k-realizable stable smooth fold map N^n\to\Bbb R^{2n-q} is a k-prem if q\le n and q\le 2k-3; or if q<n/2 and k=1; or if q\in\{2k-1,\,2k-2\} and k\in\{2,4,8\} and n is sufficiently large.
