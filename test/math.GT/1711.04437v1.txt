In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the colored HOMFLY polynomial of the figure eight knot associated with the symmetric representation. We establish an analogous asymptotic expansion for the colored HOMFLY polynomial. From the asymptotic behavior we show that the Chern-Simons invariants and twisted Reidemeister torsion can be obtained with suitable modification of the case of colored Jones polynomial.
