Given a diagram for a trisection of a 4-manifold X, we describe the homology and the intersection form of X in terms of the three subgroups of H_1(\Sigma;\mathbb{Z}) generated by the three sets of curves and the intersection pairing on the diagram surface \Sigma. This includes explicit formulas for the second and third homology groups of X as well an algorithm to compute the intersection form. Moreover, we show that all (g;k,0,0)-trisections admit "algebraically trivial" diagrams.
