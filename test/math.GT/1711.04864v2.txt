We study the Chabauty compactification of two families of closed subgroups of SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p). The first family is the set of all parahoric subgroups of SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p). Although the Chabauty compactification of parahoric subgroups is well studied, we give a different and more geometric proof using various Levi decompositions of SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p). Let C be the subgroup of diagonal matrices in SL(n, \mathbb{Q}_p). The second family is the set of all SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p)-conjugates of C. We give a classification of the Chabauty limits of conjugates of C using the action of SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p) on its associated Bruhat--Tits building and compute all of the limits for n\leq 4 (up to conjugacy). In contrast, for n\geq 7 we prove there are infinitely many SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p)-nonconjugate Chabauty limits of conjugates of C. Along the way we construct an explicit homeomorphism between the Chabauty compactification in \mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{Q}_p) of SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p)-conjugates of the p-adic Lie algebra of C and the Chabauty compactification of SL(n,\mathbb{Q}_p)-conjugates of C.
