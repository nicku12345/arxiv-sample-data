We construct an infinite family \{ C_{n,k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty} of corks of Mazur type satisfying 2n\leq \mathrm{sc}^{\mathrm{sp}}(C_{n,k})\leq O(n^{3/2}) for any positive integer n. Furthermore, using these corks, we construct an infinite family \{(W_{n,k},W'_{n,k})\}_{k=1}^{\infty} of exotic pairs of 4-manifolds with boundary whose special shadow-complexities satisfy the above inequalities. We also discuss exotic pairs with small shadow-complexity.
