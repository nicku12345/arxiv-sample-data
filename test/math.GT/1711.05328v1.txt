For a Catalan state C of a lattice crossing L\left( m,n\right)  with no returns on one side, we find its coefficient C\left( A\right)  in the Relative Kauffman Bracket Skein Module expansion of L\left( m,n\right) . We show, in particular, that C\left( A\right)  can be found using the plucking polynomial of a rooted tree with a delay function associated to C. Furthermore, for C with returns on one side only, we prove that C\left( A\right)  is a product of Gaussian polynomials, and its coefficients form a unimodal sequence.
