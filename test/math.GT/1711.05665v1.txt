We prove that any rigid representation of \pi_1\Sigma_g in \mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1) with Euler number at least g is necessarily semi-conjugate to a discrete, faithful representation into \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R}). Combined with earlier work of Matsumoto, this precisely characterizes Fuchsian actions by a topological rigidity property. Though independent, this work can be read as an introduction to the companion paper {\em rigidity and geometricity for surface group actions on the circle}, by the same authors.
