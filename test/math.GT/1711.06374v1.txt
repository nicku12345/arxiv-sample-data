In 1974, Thurston proved that, up to isotopy, every automorphism of closed orientable surface is either periodic, reducible, or pseudo-Anosov. The latter case has lead to a rich theory with applications ranging from dynamical systems to low dimensional topology. Associated with every pseudo-Anosov map is a real number \lambda > 1 known as the stretch factor. Thurston showed that every stretch factor is an algebraic unit but it is unknown exactly which units can appear as stretch factors. In this paper we show that every Salem number has a power that is the stretch factor of a pseudo-Anosov map arising from a construction due to Thurston. We also show that every totally real number field K is of the form K = \mathbb{Q}(\lambda + \lambda^{-1}), where \lambda is the stretch factor of a pseudo-Anosov map arising from Thurston's construction.
