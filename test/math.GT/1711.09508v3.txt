We introduce a generalization of the Lisca-Ozsv\'ath-Stipsicz-Szab\'o Legendrian invariant \mathfrak L to links in every rational homology sphere, using the collapsed version of link Floer homology. We represent a Legendrian link L in a contact 3-manifold (M,\xi) with a diagram D, given by an open book decomposition of (M,\xi) adapted to L, and we construct a chain complex cCFL^-(D) with a special cycle in it denoted by \mathfrak L(D). Then, given two diagrams D_1 and D_2 which represent Legendrian isotopic links, we prove that there is a map between the corresponding chain complexes, that induces an isomorphism in homology and sends \mathfrak L(D_1) into \mathfrak L(D_2). Moreover, a connected sum formula is also proved and we use it to give some applications about non-loose Legendrian links; that are links such that the restriction of \xi on their complement is tight.
