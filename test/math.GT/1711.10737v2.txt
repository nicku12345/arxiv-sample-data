In this sequel to earlier papers by three of the authors, we obtain a new bound on the complexity of a closed 3--manifold, as well as a characterisation of manifolds realising our complexity bounds. As an application, we obtain the first infinite families of minimal triangulations of Seifert fibred spaces modelled on Thurston's geometry \widetilde{\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})}.
