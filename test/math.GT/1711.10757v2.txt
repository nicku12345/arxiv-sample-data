Every closed geodesic \gamma on a surface has a canonically associated knot \widehat\gamma in the projective unit tangent bundle. We study, for \gamma filling, the volume of the associated knot complement with respect to its unique complete hyperbolic metric. We provide a lower bound for the volume relative to the number of homotopy classes of \gamma-arcs in each pair of pants of a pants decomposition of the surface.
