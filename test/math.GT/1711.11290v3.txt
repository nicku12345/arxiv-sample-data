In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the colored Jones polynomials and the Turaev-Viro invariants for the figure eight knot. More precisely, we consider the M-th colored Jones polynomials evaluated at (N+1/2)-th root of unity with a fixed limiting ratio, s, of M and (N+1/2). We find out the asymptotic expansion formula (AEF) of the colored Jones polynomials of the figure eight knot with s close to 1. Nonetheless, we show that the exponential growth rate of the colored Jones polynomials of the figure eight knot with s close to 1/2 is strictly less than those with s close to 1. It is known that the Turaev Viro invariant of the figure eight knot can be expressed in terms of a sum of its colored Jones polynomials. Our results show that this sum is asymptotically equal to the sum of the terms with s close to 1. As an application of the asymptotic behavior of the colored Jones polynomials, we obtain the asymptotic expansion formula for the Turaev-Viro invariants of the figure eight knot. Finally, we suggest a possible generalization of our approach so as to relate the AEF for the colored Jones polynomials and the AEF for the Turaev-Viro invariants for general hyperbolic knots.
