The decomposability of a Cartesian product of two nondecomposable manifolds into products of lower dimensional manifolds is studied. For 3-manifolds we obtain an analog of a result due to Borsuk for surfaces, and in higher dimensions we show that similar analogs do not exist unless one imposes further restrictions such as simple connectivity.
