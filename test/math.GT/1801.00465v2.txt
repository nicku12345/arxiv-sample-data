We study the space C(a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n) of hyperbolic 2-spheres with cone points of prescribed apex curvatures 2a_0,2a_1,\dots,2a_n\in]0,2\pi[ and some related spaces. For n=3, we get a detailed description of such spaces. The euclidean 2-spheres were considered by W. P. Thurston: for n=4, the corresponding spaces provide the famous 7 examples of nonarithmetic compact holomorphic 2-ball quotients previously constructed by Deligne-Mostow.
