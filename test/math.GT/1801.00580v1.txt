We introduce a formula for the action of Dehn twists on the HOMFLY-PT type skein module of a surface. As an application of the formula to mapping class group, we give an embedding from the Torelli group of a surface \Sigma_{g,1} of genus g with non-empty connected boundary into the completed HOMFLY-PT type skein algebra. As an application of the formula to integral homology 3-spheres, we construct an invariant z(M) \in \mathbb{Q} [\rho ] [[h]] for an integral homology 3-sphere M. The invariant z(M) \mod (h^{n+1}) is a finite type invariant of order n.
