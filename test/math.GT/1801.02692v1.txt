We show that the 3-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus 2 two-bridge knot K_{[-2q,2s,-2t,2l]} is an L-space and its fundamental group is not left-orderable. Therefore the family of 3-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus 2 two-bridge knot K_{[-2q,2s,-2t,2l]} verifies the L-space conjecture. We also show that if K_{[2k,-2l]} is a 2-bridge knot with k\geq 2, l>0, then the fundamental group of the 5-fold cyclic branched cover of K_{[2k,-2l]} is not left-orderable, which will complete the proof that the fundamental group of the 5-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus one two-bridge knot is not left-orderable.
