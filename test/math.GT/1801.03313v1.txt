We describe two locally finite graphs naturally associated to each knot type K, called Reidemeister graphs. We determine several local and global properties of these graphs and prove that in one case the graph-isomorphism type is a complete knot invariant up to mirroring. Lastly, we introduce another object, relating the Reidemeister and Gordian graphs, and determine some of its properties.
