These notes grew out of our learning and applying the methods of Fock and Goncharov concerning moduli spaces of real projective structures on surfaces with ideal triangulations. We give a self-contained treatment of Fock and Goncharov's description of the moduli space of framed marked properly convex projective structures with minimal or maximal ends, and deduce results of Marquis and Goldman as consequences. We also discuss the Poisson structure on moduli space and its relationship to Goldman's Poisson structure on the character variety.
