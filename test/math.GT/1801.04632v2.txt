Let D be an oriented link diagram with the set of regions \operatorname{r}_{D}. We define a symmetric map (or matrix) \operatorname{\tau}_{D}\colon\operatorname{r}_{D}\times \operatorname{r}_{D} \to \mathbb{Z}[x] that gives rise to an invariant of oriented links, based on a slightly modified S-equivalence of Trotter and Murasugi in the space of symmetric matrices. In particular, for real x, the negative signature of \operatorname{\tau}_{D} corrected by the writhe is conjecturally twice the Tristram--Levine signature function, where 2x=\sqrt{t}+\frac1{\sqrt{t}} with t being the indeterminate of the Alexander polynomial.
