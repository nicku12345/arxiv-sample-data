Based in the isomorphism between Lie algebroid cohomology and piecewise smooth cohomology, it is proved that the Rham cohomology of a locally trivial Lie groupoid G on a smooth manifold M is isomorphic to the piecewise Rham cohomology of G, in which G and M are manifolds without boundary and M is smoothly triangulated by a finite simplicial complex K such that, for each simplex \Delta of K, the inverse images of \Delta by the source and target mappings of G are transverses submanifolds in the ambient space G. As a consequence, it is shown that the piecewise de Rham cohomology of G does not depend on the triangulation of the base.
