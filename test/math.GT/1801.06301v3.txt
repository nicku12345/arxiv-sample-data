This is a sequel to [arXiv:1708.09092v2]. For an oriented trivalent graph G without source or sink embedded in S^3, we prove that the \mathfrak{gl}(1| 1)-Alexander polynomial \underline{\Delta}(G, c) defined by Viro satisfies a series of relations, which we call MOY-type relations in [arXiv:1708.09092v2]. As a corollary we show that the Alexander polynomial \Delta_{(G, c)}(t) studied in [arXiv:1708.09092v2] coincides with \underline{\Delta}(G, c) for a positive coloring c of G, where \Delta_{(G, c)}(t) is constructed from certain regular covering space of the complement of G in S^3 and it is the Euler characteristic of the Heegaard Floer homology of G that we studied before. When G is a plane graph, we provide a topological interpretation to the vertex state sum of \underline{\Delta}(G, c) by considering a special Heegaard diagram of G and the Fox calculus on the Heegaard surface.
