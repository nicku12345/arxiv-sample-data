In this paper we study some consequences of the author's classification of graph manifolds by their profinite fundamental groups. In particular we study commensurability, the behaviour of knots, and relation to mapping classes. We prove that the exteriors of graph knots are distinguished among all 3-manifold groups by their profinite fundamental groups. We also prove a strong conjugacy separability result for certain mapping classes of surfaces.
