We consider Lie groups {\rm SU}(n,1) and {\rm Sp}(n,1) that act as the isometries of the complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces respectively. We classify pairs of semisimple elements in {\rm Sp}(n,1) and {\rm SU}(n,1) up to conjugacy. This gives local parametrization of the representations \rho in Hom(F_2, G)/G such that both \rho(x) and \rho(y) are hyperbolics, where F_2=\langle x, y\rangle, G={\rm Sp}(n,1) or {\rm SU}(n,1). We use the {\rm PSp}(n,1)-configuration space M(n,i,m-i) of ordered m-tuples of points on \overline{{\bf H}_{\mathbb H}^n}, where first i points in an m-tuple are null points, to classify the semisimple pairs. Further, we also classify points on M(n,i,m-i).
