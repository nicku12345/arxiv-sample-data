In this paper, we introduce the (co)homology group of a multiple conjugation biquandle. It is the (co)homology group of the prismatic chain complex, which is related to the homology of foams introduced by J. S. Carter, modulo a certain subchain complex. We construct invariants for S^1-oriented handlebody-links using 2-cocycles. When a multiple conjugation biquandle X\times\mathbb{Z}_{\operatorname{type}X_Y} is obtained from a biquandle X using n-parallel operations, we provide a 2-cocycle (or 3-cocycle) of the multiple conjugation biquandle X\times\mathbb{Z}_{\operatorname{type}X_Y} from a 2-cocycle (or 3-cocycle) of the biquandle X equipped with an X-set Y.
