We discuss recent results and open questions on the broad theme of (Nielsen) realization problems. Beyond realizing subgroups of mapping class groups, there are many other natural instances where one can ask if a surjection from a group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold to another group admits a section over particular subgroups. This survey includes many open problems, and some short proofs of new results that are illustrative of key techniques; drawing attention to parallels between problems arising in different areas.
