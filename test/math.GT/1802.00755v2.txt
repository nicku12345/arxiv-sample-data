Let S be a closed surface of genus g. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between hyperbolic cone-structure on S and representations of the fundamental group into \text{PSL}_2\Bbb R. We consider surfaces of genus greater than g and we show that, under suitable conditions, every representation \rho:\pi_1 S\longrightarrow \text{PSL}_2\Bbb R with Euler number \mathcal{E}(\rho)=\pm\big(\chi(S)+1\big) arises as holonomy of a hyperbolic cone-structure \sigma on S with a single cone point of angle 4\pi. From this result, we derive that for surfaces of genus 2 every representation with \mathcal{E}(\rho)=\pm1 arises as the holonomy of some hyperbolic cone-structure.
