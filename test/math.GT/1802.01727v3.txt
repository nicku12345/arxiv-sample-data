We introduce the notion of ascent sliceness of virtual knots. A representative of a virtual knot is an embedding  S^1 \hookrightarrow \Sigma_{g} \times I , for  \Sigma_g  a closed connected oriented surface of genus  g ; the virtual knot represented is slice if there exists a pair consisting of a disc  D  and an oriented  3 -manifold  M , such that  D \hookrightarrow M \times I ,  \partial M = \Sigma_{g} , and  \partial D = S^1  (the image of the embedding).   This definition of sliceness exemplifies that a cobordism of virtual links is a pair consisting of a surface and a  3 -manifold; in addition to analysing the surfaces, as is done in classical knot theory, we may analyse the  3 -manifolds appearing in cobordisms between virtual knots. In particular, consider a Morse function on the  3 -manifold  M : away from critical points the level sets are surfaces, and we may ask how the genus of these surfaces changes as we move through the cobordism. Roughly, a slice virtual knot  K  with genus-minimal representative  S^1 \hookrightarrow \Sigma_{g} \times I  is ascent slice if, given any disc and  3 -manifold pair  ( D, M )  as above, and any Morse function  f : M \rightarrow I , the surface  \Sigma_{g+1}  appears as a level set of  f .   We use an augmented version of doubled Khovanov homology to define a property which implies ascent sliceness for slice virtual knots of minimal supporting genus  1 .
