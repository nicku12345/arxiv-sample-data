We use Heegaard Floer homology to define an invariant of homology cobordism. This invariant is isomorphic to a summand of the reduced Heegaard Floer homology of a rational homology sphere equipped with a spin structure and is analogous to Stoffregen's connected Seiberg-Witten Floer homology. We use this invariant to study the structure of the homology cobordism group and, along the way, compute the involutive correction terms for certain families of three-manifolds.
