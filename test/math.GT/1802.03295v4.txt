We define a functor \mathcal{Q} from the category of multiple conjugation biquandles to that of multiple conjugation quandles. We show that for any multiple conjugation biquandle X, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of X-colorings and that of \mathcal{Q}(X)-colorings diagrammatically for any handlebody-link and spatial trivalent graph. In particular, we prove that the set of G-family of Alexander biquandles colorings is isomorphic to that of G-family of Alexander quandles colorings as modules.
