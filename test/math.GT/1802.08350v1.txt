We investigate the geometry of closed, orientable, hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose fundamental groups are k-free for a given integer k\ge 3. We show that any such manifold M contains a point P of M with the following property: If S is the set of elements of \pi_1(M,P) represented by loops of length <\log(2k-1), then for every subset T \subset S, we have {\rm rank}\ T \le k-3. This generalizes to all k\ge3 results proved in [6] and [10], which have been used to relate the volume of a hyperbolic manifold to its topological properties, and it strictly improves on the result obtained in [11] for k=5. The proof avoids the use of results about ranks of joins and intersections in free groups that were used in [10] and [11].
