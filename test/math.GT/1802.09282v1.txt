In this paper we extend previous results concerning the behaviour of JSJ decompositions of closed 3-manifolds with respect to the profinite completion to the case of compact 3-manifolds with boundary.   We also illustrate an alternative and perhaps more natural approach to part of the original theorem, using relative cohomology to analyse the actions of an-annular atoroidal groups on profinite trees.
