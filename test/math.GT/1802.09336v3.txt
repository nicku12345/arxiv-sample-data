Two related constructions are studied: (1) The diagonal complex \mathcal{D} and its barycentric subdivision \mathcal{BD} related to a \textit{punctured} oriented surface F equipped with a number of labeled marked points. (2) The symmetric diagonal complex \mathcal{D}^{inv} and its barycentric subdivision \mathcal{BD}^{inv} related to a symmetric (=with an involution) oriented surface F equipped with a number of (symmetrically placed) labeled marked points. Eliminating a puncture gives rise to a bundle whose fibers are homeomorphic to a surgery of the surface F. The bundle can be viewed as the "universal curve with holes". The symmetric complex is shown to be homotopy equivalent to the complex of a punctured surface obtained by a surgery of the initial symmetric surface.
