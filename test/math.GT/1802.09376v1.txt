We prove that, in order to derive the HOMFLYPT skein module of the lens spaces L(p,1) from the HOMFLYPT skein module of the solid torus, \mathcal{S}({\rm ST}), it suffices to solve an infinite system of equations obtained by imposing on the Lambropoulou invariant X for knots and links in the solid torus, braid band moves that are performed only on the first moving strand of elements in a set \Lambda^{aug}, augmenting the basis \Lambda of \mathcal{S}({\rm ST}).
