Let  \text{Mod}(S_g) denote the mapping class group of the closed orientable surface S_g of genus g\geq 2. Given a finite subgroup H \leq \text{Mod}(S_g), let \text{Fix}(H) denote the set of fixed points induced by the action of H on the Teichm\"{u}ller space \text{Teich}(S_g). The Nielsen realization problem, which was answered in the affirmative by S. Kerckhoff, asks whether \text{Fix}(H) \neq \emptyset, for any given H. In this paper, we give an explicit description of \text{Fix}(H), when H is cyclic. As consequences of our main result, we provide alternative proofs for two well known results, namely a result of Harvey on \text{dim}(\text{Fix}(H)), and a result of Gilman that characterizes irreducible finite order actions. Finally, we derive a correlation between the orders of irreducible cyclic actions and the filling systems on surfaces.
