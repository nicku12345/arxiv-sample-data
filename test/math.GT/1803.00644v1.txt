A \emph{generalized dunce hat} is a 2-dimensional polyhedron created by attaching the boundary of a disk \Delta to a circle J via a map f:\partial \Delta \to J with the property that there is a point v \in J such that f^{-1}(\{v\}) is a finite set containing at least 3 points and f maps each component of \partial \Delta - f^{-1}(\{v\}) homeomorphically onto J - \{v\}. \textbf{Theorem:} No generalized dunce hat is the union of two proper subpolyhedra that each have finite first homology groups. This result undermines a strategy for proving that the interior of the Mazur compact contractible 4-manifold M is \emph{splittable in the sense of Gabai} (i.e., \intr(M) = U \cup V where U, V and U \cap V are each homeomorphic to Euclidean 4-space).
