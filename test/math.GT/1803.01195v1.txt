In \cite{HigherGnk}, the author has constructed natural maps from fundamental groups of topological spaces (restricted configuration spaces) to the groups G_{n}^{k}. In the present paper, we show that in the case of n=k+1, the group G_{k+1}^{k} is isomorphic to the fundamental group of some (quotient space of) some configuration space. In particular, this leads to the solution of word and conjugacy problems in G_{4}^{3} and sheds light on G_{k+1}^{k} for higher k.
