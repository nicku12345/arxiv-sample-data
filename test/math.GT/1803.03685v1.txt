We give a simple example showing that a knot or link diagram that lies in the {\mathbb{Z}}^2 lattice is not necessarily the projection of a lattice stick knot or link in the {\mathbb{Z}}^3 lattice, and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for when a knot or link diagram that lies in the {\mathbb{Z}}^2 lattice is in fact the projection of a lattice stick knot or link.
