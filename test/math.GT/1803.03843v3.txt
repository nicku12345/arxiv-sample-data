Take transverse immersions f from a disjoint unin of the three 4-spheres S^4_1, S^4_2, and S^4_3 into S^6 with the following properties:   (1) The restriction of f to S^4_i is an embedding,   (2) The intersection of f(S^4_i) and f(S^4_j) is not empty and connected,   (3)The intersection among f(S^4_1), f(S^4_2), and f(S^4_3) is not empty.   Then we obtain three surface-links L_i=(S^4_i\cap S^4_j, S^4_i\cap S^4_k) in S^4_i, where (i,j,k)=(1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2). We prove that, we have the equality \beta(L_1)+\beta(L_2)+\beta(L_3)=0, where \beta(L_i) is the Sato-Levine invariant of L_i, if all L_i are semi-boundary links.
