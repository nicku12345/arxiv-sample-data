To every oriented link L, we associate a topologically defined biquandle \widehat{\mathcal{B}}_{L}, which we call the topological biquandle of L. The construction of \widehat{\mathcal{B}}_{L} is similar to the topological description of the fundamental quandle given by Matveev. We find a presentation of the topological biquandle and explain how it is related to the fundamental biquandle of the link.
