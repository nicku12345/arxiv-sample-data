The Thurston norm of a 3-manifold measures the complexity of surfaces representing two-dimensional homology classes. We study the possible unit balls of Thurston norms of 3-manifolds M with b_1(M) = 2, and whose fundamental groups admit presentations with two generators and one relator. We show that even among this special class, there are 3-manifolds such that the unit ball of the Thurston norm has arbitrarily many faces.
