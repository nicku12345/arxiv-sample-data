An automorphism f of a closed orientable surface \Sigma is said to be extendable over the 3-sphere S^3 if f extends to an automorphism of the pair (S^3, \Sigma) with respect to some embedding \Sigma \hookrightarrow S^3. We prove that if an automorphism of a genus-2 surface \Sigma is extendable over S^3, then f extends to an automorphism of the pair (S^3, \Sigma) with respect to an embedding \Sigma \hookrightarrow S^3 such that \Sigma bounds genus-2 handlebodies on both sides. The classification of essential annuli in the exterior of genus-2 handlebodies embedded in S^3 due to Ozawa and the second author plays a key role.
