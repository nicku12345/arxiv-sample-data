We introduce two sequences of two-variable polynomials \{ L^n_K (t, \ell)\}_{n=1}^{\infty} and \{ F^n_K (t, \ell)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, expressed in terms of index value of a crossing and n-dwrithe value of a virtual knot K, where t and \ell are variables. Basing on the fact that n-dwrithe is a flat virtual knot invariant we prove that L^n_K and F^n_K are virtual knot invariants containing Kauffman affine index polynomial as a particular case. Using L^n_K we give sufficient conditions when virtual knot does not admit cosmetic crossing change.
