In this note, we study deformations of discrete and Zariski dense subgroups of SU(2, 1) in quaternionic hyperbolic space. Specifi- cally we consider two examples coming from representations of 3-manifold groups (the figure eight knot and Whitehead links complement) and show opposite behavior: one is not deformable outside U(2,1), while the other has a big space of deformations in Sp(2, 1).
