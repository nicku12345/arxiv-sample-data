Even Artin groups generalize right-angled Artin groups by allowing the labels in the defining graph to be even. In this paper a complete characterization of quasi-projective even Artin groups is given in terms of their defining graphs. Also, it is shown that quasi-projective even Artin groups are realizable by K(pi,1) quasi-projective spaces.
