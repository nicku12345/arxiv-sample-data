After Fossas-Parlier, we consider two graphs \mathcal{G}_{0}(S) and \mathcal{G}_{\infty}(S), constructed from multicurves on connected, orientable surfaces of infinite-type. Our first result asserts that \mathcal{G}_{\infty}(S) has finite diameter, which extends a result of Fossas-Parlier. Next, we prove that the group of (label-preserving) automorphisms of \mathcal{G}_{0}(S) is the extended mapping class group of S, which may be regarded as an infinite-type analog of a theorem of Margalit about pants complexes.
