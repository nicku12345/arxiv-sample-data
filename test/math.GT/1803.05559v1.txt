Let a be a real number satisfying 0<a<\pi. We denote by M_n(a) the configuration space of regular spherical n-gons with side-lengths a. The purpose of this paper is to determine \chi (M_n(a)) for all a and odd n. To do so, we construct a manifold X_n and a function \mu: X_n \to \mathbf{R} such that \mu^{-1}(a)=M_n(a). In fact, the function \mu is different from the well-known "wall-crossing" function. We determine the index of each critical point of \mu. Since a level set is obtained by successive Morse surgeries, we can determine \chi (M_n(a)).
