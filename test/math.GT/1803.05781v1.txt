We prove that there are rational homology balls B_p smoothly embedded in the 2-handlebodies associated to certain knots. Furthermore we show that, if we rationally blow up the 2-handlebody along the embedded rational homology ball B_p, then the resulting 4-manifold cannot be obtained just by a sequence of ordinary blow ups from the 2-handlebody under a certain mild condition.
