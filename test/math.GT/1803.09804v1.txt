Let \Sigma be a surface with negative Euler characteristic, genus at least one and at most one boundary component. We prove that the skein algebra of \Sigma over the field of rational functions can be algebraically generated by a finite number of simple closed curves that are naturally associated to certain generators of the mapping class group of \Sigma. The action of the mapping class group on the skein algebra gives canonical relations between these generators. From this, we conjecture a presentation for a skein algebra of \Sigma.
