In this paper we study the boundary at infinity of the curve complex \mathcal{C}(S) of a surface S of finite type and the relative Teichm\"{u}ller space \mathcal{T}_{el}(S) obtained from the Teichm\"{u}ller space by collapsing each region where a simple closed curve is short to be a set of diameter 1. \mathcal{C}(S) and \mathcal{T}_{el}(S) are quasi-isometric, and Masur-Minsky have shown that \mathcal{C}(S) and \mathcal{T}_{el}(S) are hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov. We show that the boundary at infinity of \mathcal{C}(S) and \mathcal{T}_{el}(S) is the space of topological equivalence classes of minimal foliations on S.
