We study decomposition into simple arcs (i. e., arcs without self-intersections) for diagrams of knots and spatial graphs. In this paper, it is proved in particular that if no edge of a finite spatial graph G is a knotted loop, then there exists a plane diagram D of G such that (i) each edge of G is represented by a simple arc of D and (ii) each vertex of G is represented by a point on the boundary of the convex hull of D. This generalizes the conjecture of S. Jablan and L. Radovi\'{c} stating that each knot has a meander diagram, i. e., a diagram composed of two simple arcs whose common endpoints lie on the boundary of the convex hull of the diagram. Also, we prove another conjecture of Jablan and Radovi\'{c} stating that each 2-bridge knot has a semi-meander minimal diagram, i. e., a minimal diagram composed of two simple arcs.
