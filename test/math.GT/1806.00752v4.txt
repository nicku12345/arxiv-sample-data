In this paper we will make use of the Mackaay-Vaz approach to the universal \mathfrak{sl}_3-homology to define a family of cycles (called \beta_3-invariants) which are transverse braid invariants. This family includes Wu's \psi_{3}-invariant. Furthermore, we analyse the vanishing of the homology classes of the \beta_3-invariants and relate it to the vanishing of Plamenevskaya's and Wu's invariants. Finally, we use the \beta_3-invariants to produce some Bennequin-type inequalities.
