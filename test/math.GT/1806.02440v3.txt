Band surgery is an operation relating pairs of knots or links in the three-sphere. We prove that if two quasi-alternating knots K and K' of the same square-free determinant are related by a band surgery, then the absolute value of the difference in their signatures is either 0 or 8. This obstruction follows from a more general theorem about the difference in the Heegaard Floer d-invariants for pairs of L-spaces that are related by distance one Dehn fillings and satisfy a certain condition in first homology. These results imply that T(2, 5) is the only torus knot T(2, m) with m square-free that admits a chirally cosmetic banding, i.e. a band surgery operation to its mirror image. We conclude with a discussion on the scarcity of chirally cosmetic bandings.
