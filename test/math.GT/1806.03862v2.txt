Betten and Riesinger constructed Parallelisms of \mathop{\rm PG}(3,\mathbb R) with automorphism group \mathop{\rm SO}(3,\mathbb R) by applying the reducible \mathop{\rm SO}(3,\mathbb R)-action to a rotational Betten spread. This was generalized by the present author so as to include oriented parallelisms (i.e., parallelisms of oriented lines). In this way, a much larger class of examples was produced. Here we show that, apart from Clifford parallelism, these are the only topological parallelisms admitting an automorphism group of dimension 3 or larger. In particular, we show that a topological parallelism admitting the irreducible action of \mathop{\rm SO}(3,\mathbb R) is Clifford.
