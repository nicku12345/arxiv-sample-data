In his celebrated paper "Generic projections", John Mather has given a striking transversality theorem and its applications on generic projections. On the other hand, in this paper, two transversality theorems on generic linearly perturbed C^r mappings are shown (r\geq 1). Moreover, some applications of the two theorems are also given.
