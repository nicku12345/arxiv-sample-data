We consider circle packings and, more generally, Delaunay circle patterns - arrangements of circles arising from a Delaunay decomposition of a finite set of points - on surfaces equipped with a complex projective structure. Motivated by a conjecture of Kojima, Mizushima and Tan, we prove that the forgetful map sending a complex projective structure admitting a circle packing with given nerve (resp. a Delaunay circle pattern with given nerve and intersection angles) to the underlying complex structure is proper.
