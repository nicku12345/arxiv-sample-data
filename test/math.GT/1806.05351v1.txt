We study embedded spheres in 4-manifolds (2-knots) via doubly pointed trisection diagrams, showing that such descriptions are unique up to stabilization and handleslides, and we describe how to obtain trisection diagrams for certain cut-and-paste operations along 2-knots directly from doubly pointed trisection diagrams. The operations described are classical surgery, Gluck surgery, blowdown, and (\pm4)-rational blowdown, and we illustrate our techniques and results with many examples.
