Combining the results by Birman and Goldberg, it was proved the normal closure of the pure braid group of the disk P_n(D) in the pure braid group of the torus P_n(T) is the commutator subgroup [P_n(T),P_n(T)]. In this paper we are going to study the case for full braid groups: i.e. the normal closure of B_n(D) in B_n(T), which turns out to have an interesting geometric description.
