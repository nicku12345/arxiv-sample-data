We introduce the notion of a "state function" for framed tangles in a disk. After choosing a finite set of states for each marked disk, a state function is a projection from the vector space spanned by all tangles to the vector space spanned by the states, that is local, and topologically invariant. Given the states for the Kauffman bracket, and the quantum SU(3)-invariant we classify all state functions, and then compare our results to the literature.
