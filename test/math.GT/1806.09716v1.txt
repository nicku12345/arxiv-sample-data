For a nontrivial knot K, Negami found an upper bound on the stick number s(K) in terms of its crossing number c(K) which is s(K) \leq 2 c(K). Later, Huh and Oh utilized the arc index \alpha(K) to present a more precise upper bound s(K) \leq \frac{3}{2} c(K) + \frac{3}{2}. Furthermore, Kim, No and Oh found an upper bound on the equilateral stick number s_{=}(K) as follows; s_{=}(K) \leq 2 c(K) +2. As a sequel to this research program, we similarly define the stick number s(G) and the equilateral stick number s_{=}(G) of a spatial graph G, and present their upper bounds as follows;  s(G) \leq \frac{3}{2} c(G) + 2e + \frac{3b}{2} -\frac{v}{2},   s_{=}(G) \leq 2 c(G) + 2e + 2b - k,  where e and v are the number of edges and vertices of G, respectively, b is the number of bouquet cut-components, and k is the number of non-splittable components.
