In this paper, we introduce a bisected vertex leveling of a plane graph. Using this planar embedding, we present elementary proofs of the well-known upper bounds in terms of the minimal crossing number on braid index b(L) and arc index \alpha(L) for any knot or non-split link L, which are b(L) \leq \frac{1}{2} c(L) + 1 and \alpha(L) \leq c(L) + 2. We also find a quadratic upper bound of the minimal crossing number of delta diagrams of L.
