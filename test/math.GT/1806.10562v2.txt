We prove that twisted correction terms in Heegaard Floer homology provide lower bounds on the Thurston norm of certain cohomology classes determined by the strong concordance class of a 2-component link L in S^3. We then specialise this procedure to knots in S^2\times S^1, and obtain a lower bound on their geometric winding number. Furthermore we produce an obstruction for a knot in S^3 to have untwisting number 1. We then provide an infinite family of null-homologous knots with increasing geometric winding number, on which the bound is sharp.
