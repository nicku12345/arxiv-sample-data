Any traversally generic vector flow on a compact manifold X with boundary leaves some residual structure on its boundary \d X. A part of this structure is the flow-generated causality map C_v, which takes a region of \d X to the complementary region. By the Holography Theorem from \cite{K4}, the map C_v allows to reconstruct X together with the unparametrized flow. The reconstruction is a manifestation of holographic description of the flow.   In the paper, we introduce and study the holographic structures on a given closed manifold Y, which mimics \d X. We generalize the Holography Theorem so that is stated in terms of fillable holographic structures on Y. Such structures are intimately linked with traversally generic vector flows on manifolds X whose boundary is Y. We conclude with few observations about the richness of holographic structures on smooth exotic spheres.
