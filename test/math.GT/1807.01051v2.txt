Let b be a pseudo-Anosov braid whose permutation has a fixed point and let M_b be the mapping torus by the pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism defined on the genus 0 fiber F_b associated with b. This paper describes a structure of the fibered cone \mathcal{C} of F for M_b. We prove that there is a 2-dimensional subcone \mathcal{C}_0 contained in the fibered cone  \mathcal{C} of F_b such that the fiber F_a for each primitive integral class a \in \mathcal{C}_0 has genus 0. We also give a constructive description of the monodromy  \phi_a: F_a \rightarrow F_a of the fibration on M_b over the circle, and consequently provide a construction of many sequences of pseudo-Anosov braids with small normalized entropies. As an application we prove that the smallest entropy among skew-palindromic braids with n strands is comparable to 1/n, and the smallest entropy among elements of the odd/even spin mapping class groups of genus g is comparable to 1/g.
