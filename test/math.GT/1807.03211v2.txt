In this paper we consider ultra-parallel complex hyperbolic triangle groups of type [m_1,m_2,0], i.e. groups of isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane, generated by complex reflections in three ultra-parallel complex geodesics two of which intersect on the boundary. We prove some discreteness and non-discreteness results for these groups and discuss the connection between the discreteness results and ellipticity of certain group elements.
