We explore properties of braids such as their fractional Dehn twist coefficients, right-veeringness, and quasipositivity, in relation to the transverse invariant from Khovanov homology defined by Plamenevskaya for their closures, which are naturally transverse links in the standard contact 3-sphere. For any 3-braid \beta, we show that the transverse invariant of its closure does not vanish whenever the fractional Dehn twist coefficient of \beta is strictly greater than one. We show that Plamenevskaya's transverse invariant is stable under adding full twists on n or fewer strands to any n-braid, and use this to detect families of braids that are not quasipositive. Motivated by the question of understanding the relationship between the smooth isotopy class of a knot and its transverse isotopy class, we also exhibit an infinite family of pretzel knots for which the transverse invariant vanishes for every transverse representative, and conclude that these knots are not quasipositive.
