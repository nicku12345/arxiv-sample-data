We make a detailed study of various (quadratic and linear) Morse-Bott trace functions on the orthogonal groups O(n). We describe the critical loci of the quadratic trace function Tr(AXBX^T) and determine their indices via perfect fillings of tables associated with the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of A and B. We give a simplified treatment of T. Frankel's analysis of the linear trace function on SO(n), as well as a combinatorial explanation of the relationship between the mod 2 Betti numbers of SO(n) and those of the Grassmannians \mathbb{G}(2k,n) obtained from this analysis. We review the basic notions of Morse-Bott cohomology in a simple case where the set of critical points has two connected components. We then use these results to give a new Morse-theoretic computation of the mod 2 Betti numbers of SO(n).
