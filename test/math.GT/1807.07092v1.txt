In 2003, Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o defined the concordance invariant \tau for knots in oriented 3-manifolds as part of the Heegaard Floer homology package. In 2011, Sarkar gave a combinatorial definition of \tau for knots in S^3 and a combinatorial proof that \tau gives a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot. Recently, Harvey and O'Donnol defined a relatively bigraded combinatorial Heegaard Floer homology theory for transverse spatial graphs in S^3 which extends knot Floer homology. We define a \mathbb{Z}-filtered chain complex for balanced spatial graphs whose associated graded chain complex has homology determined by Harvey and O'Donnol's graph Floer homology. We use this to show that there is a well-defined \tau invariant for balanced spatial graphs generalizing the \tau knot concordance invariant. In particular, this defines a \tau invariant for links in S^3. Using techniques similar to those of Sarkar, we show that our \tau invariant gives an obstruction to a link being slice.
