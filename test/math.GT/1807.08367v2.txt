We construct infinite families of closed hyperbolic surfaces that are local maxima for the systole function on their respective moduli spaces. The systole takes values along a linearly divergent sequence (L_n)_{n\geq 1} at these local maxima. The only surface corresponding to L_1\approx 3.057 is the Bolza surface in genus 2. For every genus g\geq 13, we obtain either one or two local maxima in \mathcal{M}_g whose systoles have length L_2\approx 5.909. For each n\geq 3, there is an arithmetic sequence of genera (g_k)_{k\geq 1} such that the number of local maxima of the systole function in \mathcal{M}_{g_k} at height L_n grows super-exponentially in g_k. In particular, level sets of the systole function can have an arbitrarily large number of connected components. Many of the surfaces we construct have trivial automorphism group, and are the first examples of local maxima with this property.
