We concoct a uniform treatment of mapping class groups with Thompson's groups and to generalize them. We give a description of the outer automorphism group of free groups as the isotropy group of a groupoid, akin to the mapping class groupoid of Mosher and Penner. We also illustrate some arithmetic aspects of these groupoids.
