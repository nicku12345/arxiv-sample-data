Let QI(\mathbb{R}) denote the group of all quasi-isometries f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}. Let Q_+( \text{and}~ Q_-) denote the subgroup of QI(\mathbb{R}) consisting of elements which are identity near -\infty (resp. +\infty). We denote by QI^+(\mathbb R) the index 2 subgroup of QI(\mathbb R) that fixes the ends +\infty, -\infty. We show that QI^+(\mathbb R)\cong Q_+\times Q_-. Using this we show that the center of the group QI(\mathbb{R}) is trivial.
