In this paper, we develop new techniques for understanding surfaces in \mathbb{CP}^2 via bridge trisections. Trisections are a novel approach to smooth 4-manifold topology, introduced by Gay and Kirby, that provide an avenue to apply 3-dimensional tools to 4-dimensional problems. Meier and Zupan subsequently developed the theory of bridge trisections for smoothly embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds. The main application of these techniques is a new proof of the Thom conjecture, which posits that algebraic curves in \mathbb{CP}^2 have minimal genus among all smoothly embedded, oriented surfaces in their homology class. This new proof is notable as it completely avoids any gauge theory or pseudoholomorphic curve techniques.
