We establish an inequality which gives strong restrictions on when the standard definite plumbing intersection lattice of a Seifert fibered space over S^2 can embed into a standard diagonal lattice, and give two applications. First, we answer a question of Neumann-Zagier on the relationship between Donaldson's theorem and Fintushel-Stern's R-invariant. We also give a short proof of the characterisation of Seifert fibered spaces which smoothly bound rational homology S^1 \times D^3's.
