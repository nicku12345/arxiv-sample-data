We continue our computation, using a combinatorial method based on Gronthendieck's dessins d'enfant, of the number of (weak) equivalence classes of surface branched covers matching certain specific branch data. In this note we concentrate on data with the surface of genus g as source surface, the sphere as target surface, 3 branching points, degree 2k, and local degrees over the branching points of the form [2,...,2], [2h+1,3,2,...,2], [d_1,...,d_l]. We compute the corresponding (weak) Hurwitz numbers for several values of g and h, getting explicit arithmetic formulae in terms of the d_i's.
