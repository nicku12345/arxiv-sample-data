A slope p/q is a characterising slope for a knot K in S^3 if the oriented homeomorphism type of p/q-surgery on K determines K uniquely. We show that when K is a hyperbolic knot its set of characterising slopes contains all but finitely many slopes p/q with q \geq 3. We prove stronger results for hyperbolic L-space knots, showing that all but finitely many non-integer slopes are characterising. The proof is obtained by combining Lackenby's proof that for a hyperbolic knot any slope p/q with q sufficiently large is characterising with genus bounds derived from Heegaard Floer homology.
