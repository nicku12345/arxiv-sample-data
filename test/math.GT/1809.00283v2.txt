This paper provides further investigation of the concept of shape m_{\rm simpl}-fibrators (previously introduced by the author). The main results identify shape m_{\rm simpl}-fibrators among direct products of Hopfian manifolds. First it is established that every closed orientable manifold homotopically determined by \pi_1 with coperfectly Hopfian group (a new class of Hopfian groups that are introduced here) is a shape m_{\rm simpl}o-fibrator if it is a codimension-2 fibrator (Theorem 5.4). The main result (Theorem 6.2) states that the direct product of two closed orientable manifolds (of different dimension) homotopically determined by \pi_1 and with coperfectly Hopfian fundamental groups (one normally incommensurable with the other one) is a shape m_{\rm simpl}o-fibrator, if it is a Hopfian manifold and a codimension-2 fibrator.
