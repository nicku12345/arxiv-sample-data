In this paper, we introduce the annular instanton Floer homology which is defined for links in a thickened annulus. It is an analogue of the annular Khovanov homology. A spectral sequence whose second page is the annular Khovanov homology and which converges to the annular instanton Floer homology is constructed. As an application of this spectral sequence, we prove that the annular Khovanov homology detects the unlink in the thickened annulus (assuming all the components are null-homologous). Another application is a new proof of Grigsby and Ni's result that tangle Khovanov homology distinguishes braids from other tangles.
