In previous work, we introduced a natural \mathcal{A}_{\infty}-structure on the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-monopole Floer chain complex of a closed, oriented three-manifold Y, and showed that it is non-formal in the simplest case in which Y is the three-sphere S^3. In this paper, we provide explicit descriptions of several Massey products induced on homology, and discuss how they can be used to compute the \mathrm{Pin}(2)-monopole Floer homology of connected sums in many concrete examples.
