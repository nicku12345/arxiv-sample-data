The nonorientable 4-genus \gamma_4(K) of a knot K is the smallest first Betti number of any nonorientable surface properly embedded in the 4-ball, and bounding the knot K. We study a conjecture proposed by Batson about the value of \gamma_4 for torus knots, which can be seen as a nonorientable analogue of Milnor's Conjecture for the orientable 4-genus of torus knots. We prove the conjecture for many infinite families of torus knots, by relying on a lower bound for \gamma_4 formulated by Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o. As a side product we obtain new closed formulas for the signature of torus knots.
