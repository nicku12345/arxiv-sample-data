The purpose of this paper is to give a sufficient condition for (strong) stability of non-proper smooth functions (with respect to the Whitney C^\infty--topology). We introduce the notion of end-triviality of smooth mappings, which concerns behavior of mappings around the ends of the source manifolds, and show that a Morse function is stable if it is end-trivial at any point in its discriminant. We further show that a Morse function f:N\to \mathbb{R} is strongly stable (i.e. there exists a continuous mapping g\mapsto (\Phi_g,\phi_g)\in\operatorname{Diff}(N)\times \operatorname{Diff}(\mathbb{R}) such that \phi_g\circ g\circ \Phi_g =f for any g close to f) if (and only if) f is quasi-proper. This result yields existence of a strongly stable but not infinitesimally stable function. Applying our result on stability, we also show that a locally stable Nash function on \mathbb{R}^n is stable if it satisfies some mild condition on its gradient, and as a corollary, that the following non-proper function is stable (where k\in \{1,\ldots,n-1\}): \[ G_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i^2 -\sum_{j=k+1}^n x_j^2. \]
