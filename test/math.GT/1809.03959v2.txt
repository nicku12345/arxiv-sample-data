We construct taut foliations in every closed 3-manifold obtained by r-framed Dehn surgery along a positive 3-braid knot K in S^3, where r < 2g(K)-1 and g(K) denotes the Seifert genus of K. This confirms a prediction of the L-space Conjecture. For instance, we produce taut foliations in every non-L-space obtained by surgery along the pretzel knot P(-2,3,7), and indeed along every pretzel knot P(-2,3,q), for q a positive odd integer. This is the first construction of taut foliations for every non-L-space obtained by surgery along an infinite family of hyperbolic L-space knots. Additionally, we construct taut foliations in every closed 3-manifold obtained by r-framed Dehn surgery along a positive 1-bridge braid in S^3, where r <g(K).
