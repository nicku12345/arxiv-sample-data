The Heegaard genus of a 3-manifold, as well as the growth of Heegaard genus in its finite sheeted cover spaces, has extensively been studied in terms of algebraic, geometric and topological properties of the 3-manifold. This note shows that analogous results concerning the trisection genus of a smooth, orientable 4-manifold have more general answers than their counterparts for 3-manifolds. In the case of hyperbolic 4-manifolds, upper and lower bounds are given in terms of volume and a trisection of the Davis manifold is described.
