The theory of welded and extended welded knots is a generalization of classical knot theory. Welded (resp. extended welded) knot diagrams include virtual crossings (resp. virtual crossings and wen marks) and are equivalent under an extended set of Reidemeister-type moves.   We present a new class of invariants for welded and extended welded knots and links using a multi-skein relation, following Z. Yang's approach for virtual knots. Using this skein-theoretic approach, we find sufficient conditions on the coefficients to obtain invariance under the extended Reidemeister moves appropriate to welded and extended welded links.
