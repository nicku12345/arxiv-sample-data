We study the TQFT mapping class group representations for surfaces with boundary associated with the SU(2) gauge group, or equivalently the quantum group U_q(\Sl(2)). We show that at a prime root of unity, these representations are all irreducible. We also examine braid group representations for transcendental values of the quantum parameter, where we show that the image of every mapping class group is Zariski dense.
