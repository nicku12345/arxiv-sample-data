We define combinatorial invariants of Legendrian and transverse links in universally tight lens spaces using grid diagrams, generalizing [OST08] and prove that they are equivalent to the invariants defined in [BVVV13] and [LOSS09]. We use these combinatorial invariants to characterize index one grid diagrams for knots in lens spaces which admit surgeries to the 3-sphere and discuss a potential application to the Berge conjecture.
