In this paper, we show that any convex affine domain with a nonempty limit sets on the boundary under the action of the identity component of the automorphism group cannot cover a compact affine manifold with a parallel volume, which is a positive answer to the Markus conjecture for convex case. Consequently, we show that the Markus conjecture is true for convex affine manifolds of dimension \leq 5.
