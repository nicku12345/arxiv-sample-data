We show that for X a proper \mathrm{CAT}(-1) space there is a maximal open subset of the horofunction compactification of X\times X with respect to the maximum metric that compactifies the diagonal action of an infinite quasi-convex group of the isometries of X. We also consider the product action of two quasi-convex representations of an infinite hyperbolic group on the product of two different proper \mathrm{CAT}(-1) spaces.
