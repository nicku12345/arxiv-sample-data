We study groups of germs of complex diffeomorphisms having a property called irreducibility. The notion is motivated by the similar property of the fundamental group of the complement of na irreducible hypersurface in the complex projective space. Natural examples of such groups of germ maps are given by holonomy groups and monodromy groups of integrable systems (foliations) under certain conditions. We prove some finiteness results for these groups extending previous results in [CL]. Applications are given to the framework of germs of holomorphic foliations. We prove the existence of first integrals under certain irreducibility or more general conditions on the tangent cone of the foliation after a punctual blow-up.
