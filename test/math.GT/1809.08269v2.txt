We extend the construction of upsilon-type invariants to null-homologous knots in rational homology three-spheres. By considering m-fold cyclic branched covers with m a prime power, this extension provides new knot concordance invariants \Upsilon_m^C (K) of knots in S^3. We give computations of these invariants for some families of alternating knots and reprove some independence results in the smooth concordance group.
