This paper studies twisted signature invariants of knots, with a view towards obstructions to knot concordance. Given a knot K and a representation \rho of the knot group, we define a twisted signature function \sigma_{K,\rho} \colon S^1 \to \mathbb{Z}. This invariant satisfies many of the same algebraic properties as the classical Levine-Tristram signature \sigma_K. When the representation is abelian, \sigma_{K,\rho} recovers \sigma_K, while for appropriate metabelian representations, \sigma_{K,\rho} is closely related to the Casson-Gordon invariants. Additionally, we prove satellite formulas for \sigma_{K,\rho}, which gives us a framework to explicitly compute metabelian signatures of algebraic knots. As an application, we show that the knot T_{2,3;2,15}\#T_{2,13}\#-T_{2,3;2,13}\#-T_{2,15} is not slice, as was first proved by Hedden, Kirk and Livingston. The construction of the twisted signature function relies on the twisted Blanchfield pairings as well as on an isometry classification of linking forms over \mathbb{R}[t^{\pm 1}] and \mathbb{C}[t^{\pm 1}].
