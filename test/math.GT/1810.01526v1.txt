Let \widetilde{K} be a 2-periodic knot in S^3 with quotient K. We prove a rank inequality between the knot Floer homology of \widetilde{K} and the knot Floer homology of K using a spectral sequence of Hendricks, Lipshitz and Sarkar. We also conjecture a filtered refinement of this inequality, for which we give computational evidence, and produce applications to the Alexander polynomials of \widetilde{K} and K.
