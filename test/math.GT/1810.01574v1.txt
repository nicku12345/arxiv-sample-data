A pants-block decomposition of a 3-manifold is similar to a triangulation of a 3-manifold in many aspects. In this paper we show that any two pants-block decompositions of a 3-manifold are related by a finite sequence of moves which are called P-moves. The P-moves between pants-block decompositions are similar to the Pachner moves between triangulations. Moreover, we also give a list of types of P-moves. The main tools we used in this paper are the Morse 2-functions, Reeb complexes and a new 2-dimensional complex called P-complex.
