The \mathbb{Z}_{2}-equivariant Heegaard Floer cohomlogy \widehat{HF}_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}(\Sigma(K)) of a knot K in S^{3}, constructed by Hendricks, Lipshitz, and Sarkar, is an isotopy invariant which is defined using bridge diagrams of K drawn on a sphere. We prove that \widehat{HF}_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}(\Sigma(K)) can be computed from knot Heegaard diagrams of K and show that it is a strong Heegaard invariant. As a topolocial application, we construct a transverse knot invariant \hat{\mathcal{T}}_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}(K) as an element of \widehat{HFK}_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}(\Sigma(K),K), which is a refinement of \widehat{HF}_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}(\Sigma(K)), and show that it is a refinement of both the LOSS invariant \hat{\mathcal{T}}(K) and the \mathbb{Z}_{2}-equivariant contact class c_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}(\xi_{K}).
