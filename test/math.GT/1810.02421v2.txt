Let \varphi :\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{C} be an integrable holomorphic function on the unit disk \mathbb{D} and D_{\varphi}:\mathbb{D}\to T(\mathbb{D}) the Teichm\"uller disk in the universal Teichm\"uller space T(\mathbb{D}). For a positive t it is known that D_{\varphi}(t)\to [\mu_{\varphi}]\in PML_b(\mathbb{D}) as t\to 1, where \mu_{\varphi} is a bounded measured lamination representing a point on the Thurston boundary of T(\mathbb{D}). We extend this result by showing that D_{\varphi}\colon \mathbb{D}\to T(\mathbb{D}) extends as a continuous map from the closed disk \overline{\mathbb{D}} to the Thurston bordification. In addition, we prove that the rate of convergence of D_{\varphi}(\lambda ) when \lambda\to e^{i\theta} is independent of the type of the approach to e^{i\theta}\in\partial\mathbb{D}.
