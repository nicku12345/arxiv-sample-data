This paper describes a mechanism by which a traversally generic flow v on a smooth connected manifold X with boundary produces a compact CW-complex \mathcal T(v), which is homotopy equivalent to X and such that X embeds in \mathcal T(v)\times \mathbf R. The CW-complex \mathcal T(v) captures some residual information about the smooth structure on X (such as the stable tangent bundle of X). Moreover, \mathcal T(v) is obtained from a simplicial \emph{origami map} O: D^n \to \mathcal T(v), whose source space is a disk D^n \subset \partial X of dimension n = \dim(X) -1. The fibers of O have the cardinality (n+1) at most.   The knowledge of the map O, together with the restriction to D^n of a Lyapunov function f:X \to \mathbf R for v, make it possible to reconstruct the topological type of the pair (X, \mathcal F(v)), were \mathcal F(v) is the 1-foliation, generated by v. This fact motivates the use of "holography" in the title.
