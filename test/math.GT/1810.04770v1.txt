Using an obstruction based on Donaldson's theorem, we derive strong restrictions on when a Seifert fibered space Y = F(e; \frac{p_1}{q_1}, \ldots, \frac{p_k}{q_k}) over an orientable base surface F can smoothly embed in S^4. This allows us to classify precisely when Y smoothly embeds provided e > k/2, where e is the normalized central weight and k is the number of singular fibers. Based on these results and an analysis of the Neumann-Siebenmann invariant \overline{\mu}, we make some conjectures concerning Seifert fibered spaces which embed in S^4. Finally, we also provide some applications to doubly slice Montesinos links, including a classification of the smoothly doubly slice odd pretzel knots up to mutation.
