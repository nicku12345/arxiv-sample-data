We show that the three-dimensional homology cobordism group admits an infinite-rank summand. It was previously known that the homology cobordism group contains a \mathbb{Z}^\infty-subgroup and a \mathbb{Z}-summand. Our proof proceeds by introducing an algebraic variant of the involutive Heegaard Floer package of Hendricks-Manolescu and Hendricks-Manolescu-Zemke. This is inspired by an analogous argument in the setting of knot concordance due to the second author.
