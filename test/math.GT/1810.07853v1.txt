Given a knot K we may construct a group G_n(K) from the fundamental group of K by adjoining an nth root of the meridian that commutes with the corresponding longitude. For n\geq2 these "generalised knot groups" determine K up to reflection (Nelson and Neumann, 2008; arXiv:0804.0807).   The second author has shown that for n\geq2, the generalised knot groups of the square knot SK and the granny knot GK can be distinguished by counting homomorphisms into a suitably chosen finite group (arXiv:0706.1807). We extend this result to certain generalised knot groups of square and granny knot analogues SK_{a,b}=T_{a,b}\# T_{-a,b}, GK_{a,b}=T_{a,b}\# T_{a,b}, constructed as connect sums of (a,b)-torus knots of opposite or identical chiralities. More precisely, for coprime a,b\geq2 and n satisfying a certain coprimality condition with a and b, we construct an explicit finite group G (depending on a, b and n) such that G_n(SK_{a,b}) and G_n(GK_{a},b) can be distinguished by counting homomorphisms into G. The coprimality condition includes all n\geq2 coprime to ab. The result shows that the difference between these two groups can be detected using a finite group.
