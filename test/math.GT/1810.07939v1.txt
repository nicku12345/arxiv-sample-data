Let G be a group with a finite balanced presentation P. We associate a Heegaard Floer homology group \widehat{HF}_P(G) with the pair (G,P) based on some extra choices and technical assumptions. We show that \widehat{HF}_P(G) is independent from these choices and also is invariant under stable Andrews-Curtis transformations on P, based on two claims which are not settled in this paper.
