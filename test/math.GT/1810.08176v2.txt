For each integral homology sphere Y, a function \Gamma_Y on the set of integers is constructed. It is established that \Gamma_Y depends only on the homology cobordism of Y and it recovers the Fr{\o}yshov invariant. A relation between \Gamma_Y and Fintushel-Stern's R-invariant is stated. It is shown that the value of \Gamma_Y at each integer is related to the critical values of the Chern-Simons functional. Some topological applications of \Gamma_Y are given. In particular, it is shown that if \Gamma_Y is trivial, then there is no simply connected homology cobordism from Y to itself.
