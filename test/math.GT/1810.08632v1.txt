A parametric curve \gamma of class C^n on the n-sphere is said to be nondegenerate (or locally convex) when \det\left(\gamma(t),\gamma'(t),\cdots,\gamma^{(n)}(t)\right)>0 for all values of the parameter t. We orthogonalize this ordered basis to obtain the Frenet frame \mathfrak{F}_{\gamma} of \gamma assuming values in the orthogonal group \operatorname{SO}_{n+1} (or its universal double cover, \operatorname{Spin}_{n+1}), which we decompose into Schubert or Bruhat cells. To each nondegenerate curve \gamma we assign its itinerary: a word w in the alphabet S_{n+1}\smallsetminus\{e\} that encodes the succession of non open Schubert cells pierced by the complete flag of \mathbb{R}^{n+1} spanned by the columns of \mathfrak{F}_{\gamma}. Without loss of generality, we can focus on nondegenerate curves with initial and final flags both fixed at the (non oriented) standard complete flag. For such curves, given a word w, the subspace of curves following the itinerary w is a contractible globally collared topological submanifold of finite codimension. By a construction reminiscent of Poincar\'e duality, we define abstract cell complexes mapped into the original space of curves by weak homotopy equivalences. The gluing instructions come from a partial order in the set of words. The main aim of this construction is to attempt to determine the homotopy type of spaces of nondegenerate curves for n>2. The reader may want to contrast the present paper's combinatorial approach with the geometry-flavoured methods of previous works.
