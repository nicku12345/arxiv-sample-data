For an oriented diagram of a link L in the 3-sphere, Cho and Murakami defined the potential function whose critical point, slightly different from the usual sense, corresponds to a boundary parabolic \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})-representation of \pi_1(S^3 \setminus L). They also showed that the volume and Chern-Simons invariant of such a representation can be computed from the potential function with its partial derivatives. In this paper, we extend the potential function to a \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})-representation that is not necessarily boundary parabolic. Under a mild assumption, it leads us to a combinatorial formula for computing the volume and Chern-Simons invariant of a \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})-representation of a closed 3-manifold.
