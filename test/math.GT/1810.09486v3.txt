We extend some properties of random walks on hyperbolic groups to random walks on convergence groups. In particular we prove that if a convergence group G acts on a compact metrizable space M with the convergence property then we can provide G\cup M with a compact topology such that random walks on G converge almost surely to points in M. Furthermore we prove that if G is finitely generated and the random walk has finite entropy and finite logarithmic moment with respect to the word metric, then M, with the corresponding hitting measure, can be seen as a model for the Poisson boundary of G.
