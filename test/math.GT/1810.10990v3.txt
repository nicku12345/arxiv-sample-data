In this paper we extend Y.Eliashberg's h-principle to arbitrary generic smooth maps of smooth manifolds. Namely, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous map of smooth manifolds of the same dimension to be homotopic to a generic map with a prescribed Thom-Boardman singularity \Sigma^I at each point and with no other critical points. In dimension 3 we rephrase these conditions in terms of the Stiefel-Whitney classes and the cohomology classes of the given loci of folds, cusps and swallowtail points.
