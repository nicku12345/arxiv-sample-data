In this paper, I construct the holonomy extension locus of a \mathbb{Q}-homology solid torus which is an analog of its translation extension locus. Using extension loci, I study \mathbb{Q}-homology 3-spheres coming from Dehn fillings of \mathbb{Q}-homology solid tori and construct intervals of orderable Dehn fillings.
