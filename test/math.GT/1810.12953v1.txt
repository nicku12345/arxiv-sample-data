We prove an effective version of a theorem relating curve complex distance to electric distance in hyperbolic 3-manifolds, up to errors that are polynomial in the complexity of the underlying surface. We use this to give an effective proof of a result regarding maps between curve complexes of surfaces induced by finite covers. As applications, we effectively relate the electric circumference of a fibered manifold to the curve complex translation length of its monodromy, and we give quantitative bounds on virtual specialness for cube complexes dual to curves on surfaces.
