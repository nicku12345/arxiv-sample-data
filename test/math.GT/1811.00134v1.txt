We show that the bordered-sutured Floer invariant of the complement of a tangle in an arbitrary 3-manifold Y, with minimal conditions on the bordered-sutured structure, satisfies an unoriented skein exact triangle. This generalizes a theorem by Manolescu for links in S^3. We give a theoretical proof of this result by adapting holomorphic polygon counts to the bordered-sutured setting, and also give a combinatorial description of all maps involved and explicitly compute them. We then show that, for Y = S^3, our exact triangle coincides with Manolescu's. Finally, we provide a graded version of our result, explaining in detail the grading reduction process involved.
