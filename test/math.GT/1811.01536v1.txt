We describe a scheme for constructing generating sets for Kronheimer and Mrowka's singular instanton knot homology for the case of knots in lens spaces. The scheme involves Heegaard-splitting a lens space containing a knot into two solid tori. One solid torus contains a portion of the knot consisting of an unknotted arc, as well as holonomy perturbations of the Chern-Simons functional used to define the homology theory. The other solid torus contains the remainder of the knot. The Heegaard splitting yields a pair of Lagrangians in the traceless SU(2)-character variety of the twice-punctured torus, and the intersection points of these Lagrangians comprise the generating set that we seek. We illustrate the scheme by constructing generating sets for several example knots. Our scheme is a direct generalization of a scheme introduced by Hedden, Herald, and Kirk for describing generating sets for knots in S^3 in terms of Lagrangian intersections in the traceless SU(2)-character variety for the 2-sphere with four punctures.
