We study the convergence of volume-normalized Betti numbers in Benjamini-Schramm convergent sequences of non-positively curved manifolds with finite volume. In particular, we show that if X is an irreducible symmetric space of noncompact type, X \neq \mathbb H^3, and (M_n) is any Benjamini-Schramm convergent sequence of finite volume X-manifolds, then the normalized Betti numbers b_k(M_n)/vol(M_n) converge for all k.   As a corollary, if X has higher rank and (M_n) is any sequence of distinct, finite volume X-manifolds, the normalized Betti numbers of M_n converge to the L^2 Betti numbers of X. This extends our earlier work with Nikolov, Raimbault and Samet, where we proved the same convergence result for uniformly thick sequences of compact X-manifolds.
