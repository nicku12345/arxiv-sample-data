One of the open problems in quantitative topology is as follows. Given homotopic mappings f_0,f_1: S^m\rightarrow S^n of Lipschitz constant L build the (asymptotically) simplest homotopy f_\bullet: S^m\times[0,1]\rightarrow S^n between them. The present paper resolves this problem for the first formerly open case m=3, n=2 constructing a homotopy f_\bullet with Lipschitz constant O(L).
