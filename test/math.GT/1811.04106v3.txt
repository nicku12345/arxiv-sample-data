This paper extends the results from the author's previous paper to consider finite, fiber- and orientation- preserving group actions on closed, orientable Seifert manifolds M that fiber over a non-orientable base space. An orientable base space double cover \tilde{M} of M is constructed and then an isomorphism between the fiber- and orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of {M} and the fiber- and orientation-preserving actions on \tilde{M} that preserve the orientation on the fibers and commute with the covering translation is shown. This result and previous results lead to a construction of all actions that satisfy a condition on the obstruction term and the structure of the finite groups that can act on M.
