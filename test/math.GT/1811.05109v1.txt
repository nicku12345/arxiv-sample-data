The union of singular orbits of an effective locally smooth circle action on the 4-sphere consists of two 2-knots, K and K^{\prime}, intersecting at two points transversely. Each of K and K^{\prime} is called a branched twist spin. A twist spun knot is an example of a branched twist spin. The Gluck twists along branched twist spins are studied by Fintushel, Gordon and Pao. In this paper, we determine the 2-knot obtained from K by the Gluck twist along K^{\prime}. As an application, we give infinitely many pairs of inequivalent branched twist spins whose complements are homeomorphic.
