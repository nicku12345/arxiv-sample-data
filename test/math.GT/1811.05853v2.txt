We examine surgery on a knot in S^3 to determine surgery obstructions to Seifert fibered integral homology spheres. We find such surgery obstructions using Heegaard Floer, Knot Floer homology and the mapping cone formula for computing Heegaard Floer homology of surgery on a knot. Here however, we take a different approach and use the number of singular fibers of a Seifert fibered integral homology sphere, which is the toroidal structure, to find obstructions. This approach allows us to show that genus one knots cannot yield Seifert fibered integral homology spheres with six or more singular fibers. Some other obstructions are also presented for higher genus knots.
