A well-known conjecture of Rasmussen states that for any knot K in S^{3}, the rank of the reduced Khovanov homology of K is greater than or equal to the rank of the reduced knot Floer homology of K. This rank inequality is supposed to arise as the result of a spectral sequence from Khovanov homology to knot Floer homology. Using an oriented cube of resolutions construction for a homology theory related to knot Floer homology, we prove this conjecture.
