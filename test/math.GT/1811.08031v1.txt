We prove that, up to homeomorphism, any graph subject to natural necessary conditions on orientation and the number of cycles can be realized as the Reeb graph of a Morse function on a given closed manifold M. Along the way, we show that the Reeb number \mathcal{R}(M), i.e. the maximal number of cycles among all Reeb graphs of functions on M, is equal to the corank of fundamental group \pi_1(M), thus extending a previous result of Gelbukh to the non-orientable case.
