We investigate the problem of characterising the family of strongly quasipositive links which have definite symmetrised Seifert forms and apply our results to the problem of determining when such a link can have an L-space cyclic branched cover. In particular, we show that if \delta_n = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \ldots \sigma_{n-1} is the dual Garside element and b = \delta_n^k P \in B_n is a strongly quasipositive braid whose braid closure \widehat b is definite, then k \geq 2 implies that \widehat b is one of the torus links T(2, q), T(3,4), T(3,5) or pretzel links P(-2, 2, m), P(-2,3,4). Applying Theorem 1.1 of our previous paper we deduce that if one of the standard cyclic branched covers of \widehat b is an L-space, then \widehat b is one of these links. We show by example that there are strongly quasipositive braids \delta_n P whose closures are definite but not one of these torus or pretzel links. We also determine the family of definite strongly quasipositive 3-braids and show that their closures coincide with the family of strongly quasipositive 3-braids with an L-space branched cover.
