We show that if K is a fibered ribbon knot in S^3=\partial B^4 bounding ribbon disk D, then with a transversality condition the fibration on S^3\setminus\nu(K) extends to a fibration of B^4\setminus\nu(D). This partially answers a question of Casson and Gordon. In particular, we show the fibration always extends when D has exactly two local minima. More generally, we construct movies of singular fibrations on 4-manifolds and describe a sufficient property of a movie to imply the underlying 4-manifold is fibered over S^1.
