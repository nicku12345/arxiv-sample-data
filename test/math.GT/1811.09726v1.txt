We present four models for a random graph and show that, in each case, the probability that a graph is intrinsically knotted goes to one as the number of vertices increases. We also argue that, for k \geq 18, most graphs of order k are intrinsically knotted and, for k \geq 2n+9, most of order k are not n-apex. We observe that p(n) = 1/n is the threshold for intrinsic knotting and linking in Gilbert's model.
