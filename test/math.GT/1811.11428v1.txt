Let M be a closed n-dimensional manifold, n > 2, whose first real cohomology group H 1 (M ; R) is non-zero. We present a general method for constructing a Morse 1-form \alpha on M , closed but non-exact, and a pseudo-gradient X such that the differential \partial X of the Novikov complex of the pair (\alpha, X) has at least one incidence coefficient which is an infinite series. This is an application of our previous study of the homoclinic bifurcation of pseudo-gradients of multivalued Morse functions.
