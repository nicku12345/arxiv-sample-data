In this paper, we explore the interplay between contact structures and sutured monopole Floer homology. First, we study the behavior of contact elements, which were defined by Baldwin and Sivek, under the operation of performing Floer excisions, which was introduced to the context of sutured monopole Floer homology by Kronheimer and Mrowka. We then compute the sutured monopole Floer homology of some special balanced sutured manifolds, using tools closely related to contact geometry. For application, we obtain an exact triangle for the oriented skein relation in monopole theory and derive a connected sum formula for sutured monopole Floer homology.
