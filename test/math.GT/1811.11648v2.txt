This paper is a survey on the theory of knotoids and braidoids. Knotoids are open ended knot diagrams in surfaces and braidoids are geometric objects analogous to classical braids, forming a counterpart theory to the theory of knotoids in the plane. We survey through the fundamental notions and existing works on these objects as well as their applications in the study of proteins.
