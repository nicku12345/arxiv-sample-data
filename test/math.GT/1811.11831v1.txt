In this paper we construct families of homology spheres which bound 4-manifolds with intersection forms isomorphic to -E_8. We show that these families have arbitrary large correction terms. This result says that among homology spheres, the difference of the maximal rank of minimal sub-lattice of definite filling and the maximal rank of even definite filling is arbitrarily large.
