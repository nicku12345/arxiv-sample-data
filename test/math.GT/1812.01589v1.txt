2-stratifolds are a generalization of 2-manifolds that occur as objects in applications such as in TDA. These spaces can be described by an associated bicoloured labelled graph. In previous papers we obtained a classification of 1-connected trivalent 2-stratifolds. In this paper we classify trivalent 2-stratifolds that have fundamental group \mathbb{Z}. This classification implicitly gives an efficient algorithm that applies to a bicoloured labelled graph to decide wether the associated 2-stratifold has fundamental group \mathbb{Z}.
