We study the knot invariant called trunk, as defined by Ozawa, and the relation of the trunk of a satellite knot with the trunk of its companion knot. Our first result is {\rm trunk}(K) \geq n \cdot {\rm trunk}(J) where {\rm trunk}(\cdot) denotes the trunk of a knot, K is a satellite knot with companion J, and n is the winding number of K. To upgrade winding number to wrapping number, which we denote by m, we must include an extra factor of \frac{1}{2} in our second result {\rm trunk}(K) > \frac{1}{2} m\cdot {\rm trunk}(J) since m \geq n. We also discuss generalizations of the second result.
