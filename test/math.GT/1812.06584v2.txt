We revisit Rozansky's construction of Khovanov homology for links in S^2\times S^1, extending it to define Khovanov homology Kh(L) for links L in M^r=#^r(S^2\times S^1) for any r. The graded Euler characteristic of Kh(L) can be used to recover WRT invariants at certain roots of unity, and also recovers the evaluation of L in the skein module \mathcal{S}(M^r) of Hoste and Przytycki when L is null-homologous in M^r. The construction also allows for a clear path towards defining a Lee's homology Kh'(L) and associated s-invariant for such L, which we will explore in an upcoming paper. We also give an equivalent construction for the Khovanov homology of the knotification of a link in S^3 and show directly that this is invariant under handle-slides, in the hope of lifting this version to give a stable homotopy type for such knotifications in a future paper.
