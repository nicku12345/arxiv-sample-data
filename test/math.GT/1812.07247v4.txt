Let \mathbb F=\mathbb R, \mathbb C or \mathbb H. Let {\bf H}_{\mathbb F}^n denote the n-dimensional \mathbb F-hyperbolic space. Let {\rm U}(n,1; \mathbb F) be the linear group that acts by the isometries. A subgroup G of {\rm U}(n,1; \mathbb F) is called \emph{Zariski dense} if it does not fix a point on the closure of the \mathbb F-hyperbolic space, and neither it preserves a totally geodesic subspace of it. We prove that a Zariski dense subgroup G of {\rm U}(n,1; \mathbb F) is discrete if for every loxodromic element g \in G, the two generator subgroup \langle f, g \rangle is discrete, where f \in {\rm U}(n,1; \mathbb F) is a test map not necessarily from G.
