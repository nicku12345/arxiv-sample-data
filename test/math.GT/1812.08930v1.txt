We study petal diagrams of knots, which provide a method of describing knots in terms of permutations in a symmetric group S_{2n+1}. We define two classes of moves on such permutations, called trivial petal additions and crossing exchanges, which do not change the isotopy class of the underlying knot. We prove that any two permutations which represent isotopic knots can be related by a sequence of these moves and their inverses.
