We work on the notions of rail arcs and rail isotopy in \mathbb{R}^3, and we introduce the notions of rail knotoid diagrams and their equivalence. Our main result is that two rail arcs in \mathbb{R}^3 are rail isotopic if and only if their knotoid diagram projections onto the plane of the two lines which we call rails, are equivalent. We also make a connection between the rail isotopy in \mathbb{R}^3 and the knot theory of the handlebody of genus 2.
