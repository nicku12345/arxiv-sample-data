Kjuchukova's \Xi_p invariant gives a ribbon obstruction for Fox p-colored knots. The invariant is derived from dihedral branched covers of 4-manifolds, and is needed to calculate the signatures of these covers, when singularities on the branching sets are present. In this note, we give an algorithm for evaluating \Xi_p from a colored knot diagram, and compute a couple of examples.
