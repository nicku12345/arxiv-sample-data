Lee homology (a variant of Khovanov homology) over \mathbb{Q} possesses the "canonical generators" as its basis. The generators (Lee's classes) [\alpha(D, o)] are constructed combinatorially from an oriented link diagram D, one for each alternative orientation o on D. Let R be an integral domain. There exists a family of link homology theory \{ H_c(-; R) \}_{c \in R}, where Khovanov's theory corresponds to c = 0 and Lee's theory corresponds to c = 2. For each c \in R \setminus 0, Lee's classes [\alpha(D, o)] can be defined as elements in H_c(D; R), but when c is not invertible then they do not form a basis; in fact they are divisible by c-powers. We define the c-divisibility k_c(D) of [\alpha(D, o)] with o the given orientation of D. For any link L and its diagram D, we prove that \bar{s}_c(L) := 2k_c(D) + w(D) - r(D) + 1 is a link invariant, where w is the writhe, and r is the number of Seifert circles. We pose the question whether \bar{s}_c coincides with Rasmussen's s-invariant. There are several evidences that support the affirmative answer. For instance, \bar{s}_c is a link concordance invariant, and the Milnor conjecture can be reproved using \bar{s}_c. Also for the special case (R, c) = (\mathbb{Q}[h], h), our \bar{s}_c actually coincides with s as knot invariants.
