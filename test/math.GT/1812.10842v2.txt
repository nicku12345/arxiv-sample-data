Let K\subset S^3 be a Fox p-colored knot and assume K bounds a locally flat surface S\subset B^4 over which the given p-coloring extends. This coloring of S induces a dihedral branched cover X\to S^4. Its branching set is a closed surface embedded in S^4 locally flatly away from one singularity whose link is K. When S is homotopy ribbon and X a definite four-manifold, a condition relating the signature of X and the Murasugi signature of K guarantees that S in fact realizes the four-genus of K. We exhibit an infinite family of knots K_m with this property, each with a {Fox 3-}colored surface of minimal genus m. As a consequence, we classify the signatures of manifolds X which arise as dihedral covers of S^4 in the above sense.
