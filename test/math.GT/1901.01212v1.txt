Fleming and Foisy recently proved the existence of a digraph whose every embedding contains a 4-component link, and left open the possibility that a directed graph with an intrinsic n-component link might exist. We show that, indeed, this is the case. In fact, much as Flapan, Mellor, and Naimi show for graphs, knotting and linking are arbitrarily complex in directed graphs. Specifically, we prove the analog for digraphs of the main theorem of their paper: for any n and \alpha, every embedding of a sufficiently large complete digraph in \mathbb{R}^3 contains an oriented link with components Q_1, \ldots, Q_n such that, for every i \neq j, |\mathrm{lk}(Q_i,Q_j)| \geq \alpha and |a_2(Q_i)| \geq \alpha, where a_2(Q_i) denotes the second coefficient of the Conway polynomial of Q_i.
