We determine p-colorability of the paradromic rings. These rings arise by generalizing the well-known experiment of bisecting a Mobius strip. Instead of joining the ends with a single half twist, use m twists, and, rather than bisecting (n = 2), cut the strip into n sections. We call the resulting collection of thin strips P(m,n). By replacing each thin strip with its midline, we think of P(m,n) as a link, that is, a collection of circles in space. Using the notion of p-colorability from knot theory, we determine, for each m and n, which primes p can be used to color P(m,n).   Amazingly, almost all admit 0, 1, or an infinite number of prime colorings! This is reminiscent of solutions sets in linear algebra. Indeed, the problem quickly turns into a study of the eigenvalues of a large, nearly diagonal matrix.   Our paper combines this explicit calculation in linear algebra with a survey of several ideas from knot theory including colorability and torus links.
