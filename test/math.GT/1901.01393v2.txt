We define the stabilizing number \operatorname{sn}(K) of a knot K \subset S^3 as the minimal number n of S^2 \times S^2 connected summands required for K to bound a nullhomotopic locally flat disc in D^4 \# n S^2 \times S^2. This quantity is defined when the Arf invariant of K is zero. We show that \operatorname{sn}(K) is bounded below by signatures and Casson-Gordon invariants and bounded above by the topological 4-genus g_4^{\operatorname{top}}(K). We provide an infinite family of examples with \operatorname{sn}(K)<g_4^{\operatorname{top}}(K).
