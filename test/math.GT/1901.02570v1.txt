In a recent paper, Lin, Ruberman and Saveliev proved a splitting formula expressing the Seiberg-Witten invariant \lambda_{SW}(X) of a smooth 4-manifold with rational homology of S^1\times S^3 in terms of the Fr{\o}yshov invariant h(X) and a Lefschetz number in reduced monopole Floer homology. In this note we observe that a similar splitting formula holds in reduced instanton Floer homology.
