The Masur domain is a subset of the space of projective measured geodesic laminations on the boundary of a 3-manifold M. This domain plays an important role in the study of the hyperbolic structures on the interior of M. In this paper, we define an extension of the Masur domain and explain that it shares a lot of properties with the Masur domain.
