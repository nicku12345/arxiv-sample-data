Let B be a M\"obius band and f:B \to \mathbb{R} be a Morse map taking a constant value on \partial B, and \mathcal{S}(f,\partial B) be the group of diffeomorphisms h of B fixed on \partial B and preserving f in the sense that f\circ h = f. Under certain assumptions on f we compute the group \pi_0\mathcal{S}(f,\partial B) of isotopy classes of such diffeomorphisms. In fact, those computations hold for functions f:B\to\mathbb{R} whose germs at critical points are smoothly equivalent to homogeneous polynomials \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R} without multiple factors.   Together with previous results of the second author this allows to compute similar groups for certain classes of smooth functions f:N\to\mathbb{R} on non-orientable surfaces N.
