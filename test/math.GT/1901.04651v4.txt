Goldman parametrizes the \mathrm{PSL}_3(\mathbb{R})-Hitchin component of a closed oriented hyperbolic surface of genus g by 16g-16 parameters. Among them, 10g-10 coordinates are canonical. We prove that the \mathrm{PSL}_3(\mathbb{R})-Hitchin component equipped with the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman symplectic form admits a global Darboux coordinate system such that the half of its coordinates are canonical Goldman coordinates. To this end, we show a version of the action-angle principle and the Zocca-type decomposition formula for the symplectic form of H. Kim and Guruprasad-Huebschmann-Jeffrey-Weinstein given to symplectic leaves of the Hitchin component.
