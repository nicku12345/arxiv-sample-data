Gay and Kirby introduced trisections which describe any closed oriented smooth 4-manifold X as a union of three four-dimensional handlebodies. A trisection is encoded in a diagram, namely three collections of curves in a closed oriented surface \Sigma, guiding the gluing of the handlebodies. Any morphism \varphi from \pi_1(X) to a finitely generated free abelian group induces a morphism on \pi_1(\Sigma). We express the twisted homology and Reidemeister torsion of (X;\varphi) in terms of the first homology of (\Sigma;\varphi) and the three subspaces generated by the collections of curves. We also express the intersection form of (X;\varphi) in terms of the intersection form of (\Sigma;\varphi).
