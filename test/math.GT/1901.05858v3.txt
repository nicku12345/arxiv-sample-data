Let X^4 and Y^4 be smooth manifolds and f: X\to Y a branched cover with branching set B. Classically, if B is smoothly embedded in Y, the signature \sigma(X) can be computed from data about Y, B and the local degrees of f. When f is an irregular dihedral cover and B\subset Y smoothly embedded away from a cone singularity whose link is K, the second author gave a formula for the contribution \Xi(K) to \sigma(X) resulting from the non-smooth point. We extend the above results to the case where Y is a {\it topological} four-manifold and B is locally flat, away from the possible singularity. Owing to the presence of non-locally-flat points on B, X in this setting is a stratified pseudomanifold, and we use the Intersection Homology signature of X, \sigma_{IH}(X). For any knot K whose determinant is not \pm 1, a homotopy ribbon obstruction is derived from \Xi(K), providing a new technique to potentially detect slice knots that are not ribbon.
