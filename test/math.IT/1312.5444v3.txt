Denoising methods require some assumptions about the signal of interest and the noise. While most denoising procedures require some knowledge about the noise level, which may be unknown in practice, here we assume that the signal expansion in a given dictionary has a distribution that is more heavy-tailed than the noise. We show how this hypothesis leads to a stopping criterion for greedy pursuit algorithms which is independent from the noise level. Inspired by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning, we propose a strategy to reduce the variance of greedy estimates by averaging pursuits obtained from randomly subsampled dictionaries. We call this denoising procedure Blind Random Pursuit Denoising (BIRD). We offer a generalization to multidimensional signals, with a structured sparse model (S-BIRD). The relevance of this approach is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental MEG signals where, without any parameter tuning, BIRD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms even when they are informed by the noise level. Code is available to reproduce all experiments.
