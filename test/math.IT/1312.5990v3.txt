We prove two results on the universality of polar codes for source coding and channel communication. First, we show that for any polar code built for a source P_{X,Z} there exists a slightly modified polar code - having the same rate, the same encoding and decoding complexity and the same error rate - that is universal for every source P_{X,Y} when using successive cancellation decoding, at least when the channel P_{Y|X} is more capable than P_{Z|X} and P_X is such that it maximizes I(X;Y) - I(X;Z) for the given channels P_{Y|X} and P_{Z|X}. This result extends to channel coding for discrete memoryless channels. Second, we prove that polar codes using successive cancellation decoding are universal for less noisy discrete memoryless channels.
