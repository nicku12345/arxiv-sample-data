Complex orthogonal design (COD) with parameter [p, n, k] is a combinatorial design used in space-time block codes (STBCs). For STBC, n is the number of antennas, k/p is the rate, and p is the decoding delay. A class of rate 1/2 COD called balanced complex orthogonal design (BCOD) has been proposed by Adams et al., and they constructed BCODs with rate k/p = 1/2 and decoding delay p = 2^m for n=2m. Furthermore, they prove that the constructions have optimal decoding delay when m is congruent to 1, 2, or 3 module 4. They conjecture that for the case m \equiv 0 \pmod 4, 2^m is also a lower bound of p. In this paper, we prove this conjecture.
