Integrated information theory is a mathematical, quantifiable theory of conscious experience. The linchpin of this theory, the \phi measure, quantifies a system's irreducibility to disjoint parts. Purely as a measure of irreducibility, we pinpoint three concerns about \phi and propose a revised measure, \psi, which addresses them. Our measure \psi is rigorously grounded in Partial Information Decomposition and is faster to compute than \phi.
