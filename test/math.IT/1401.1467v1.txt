We consider two quantities that measure complexity of binary strings: \mathit{KA}(x) is defined as the minus logarithm of continuous a priori probability on the binary tree, and \mathit{KP}(x) denotes prefix complexity of a binary string x. In this paper we answer a question posed by Joseph Miller and prove that there exists an infinite binary sequence \omega such that the sum of 2^{\mathit{KA}(x)-\mathit{KP}(x)} over all prefixes x of \omega is infinite. Such a sequence can be chosen among characteristic sequences of computably enumerable sets.
