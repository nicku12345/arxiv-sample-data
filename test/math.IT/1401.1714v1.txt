The analogies between successive interference cancellation (SIC) in slotted ALOHA framework and iterative belief-propagation erasure-decoding, established recently, enabled the application of the erasure-coding theory and tools to design random access schemes. This approach leads to throughput substantially higher than the one offered by the traditional slotted ALOHA. In the simplest setting, SIC progresses when a successful decoding occurs for a single user transmission. In this paper we consider a more general setting of a channel with capture and explore how such physical model affects the design of the coded random access protocol. Specifically, we assess the impact of capture effect in Rayleigh fading scenario on the design of SIC-enabled slotted ALOHA schemes. We provide analytical treatment of frameless ALOHA, which is a special case of SIC-enabled ALOHA scheme. We demonstrate both through analytical and simulation results that the capture effect can be very beneficial in terms of achieved throughput.
