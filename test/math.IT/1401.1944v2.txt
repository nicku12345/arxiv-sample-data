This paper examines the efficiency of spatial and frequency dimensions in serving multiple users in the downlink of a small cell wireless network with randomly deployed access points. For this purpose, the stochastic geometry framework is incorporated, taking into account the user distribution within each cell and the effect of sharing the available system resources to multiple users. An analysis of performance in terms of signal-to-interference-ratio and achieved user rate is provided that holds under the class of non-cooperative multiple access schemes. In order to obtain concrete results, two simple instances of multiple access schemes are considered. It is shown that performance depends critically on both the availability of frequency and/or spatial dimensions as well as the way they are employed. In particular, increasing the number of available frequency dimensions alone is beneficial for users experiencing large interference, whereas increasing spatial dimensions without employing frequency dimensions degrades performance. However, best performance is achieved when both dimensions are combined in serving the users.
