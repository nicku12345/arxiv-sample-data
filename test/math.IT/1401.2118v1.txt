We investigate the capacity of the Q-frequency S-user vector adder channel (channel with intensity information) introduced by Chang and Wolf. Both coordinated and uncoordinated types of transmission are considered. Asymptotic (under the conditions Q \to \infty, S = \gamma Q and 0 < \gamma < \infty) upper and lower bounds on the relative (per subchannel) capacity are derived. The lower bound for the coordinated case is shown to increase when \gamma grows. At the same time the relative capacity for the uncoordinated case is upper bounded by a constant.
