A new approach toward the noncoherent communications over the time varying fading channels is presented. In this approach, the relationship between the input signal space and the output signal space of a correlatively changing fading channel is shown to be a nonlinear mapping between manifolds of different dimensions. Studying this mapping, it is shown that using nonlinear decoding algorithms for single input-multiple output (SIMO) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, extra numbers of degrees of freedom (DOF) are available. We call them the nonlinear degrees of freedom.
