This work presents another look at an analog network coding scheme for multi-user spread-spectrum communication systems. Our proposed system combines coding and cooperation between a relay and users to boost the throughput and to exploit interference. To this end, each pair of users, \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{B}, that communicate with each other via a relay \mathcal{R} shares the same spreading code. The relay has two roles, it synchronizes network transmissions and it broadcasts the combined signals received from users. From user \mathcal{B}'s point of view, the signal is decoded, and then, the data transmitted by user \mathcal{A} is recovered by subtracting user \mathcal{B}'s own data. We derive the analytical performance of this system for an additive white Gaussian noise channel with the presence of multi-user interference, and we confirm its accuracy by simulation.
