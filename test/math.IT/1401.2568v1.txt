In this paper, communication of a Multivariate Gaussian over a Gaussian Multiple Access Channel is studied. Distributed zero-delay joint source-channel coding (JSCC) solutions to the problem are given. Both nonlinear and linear approaches are discussed. The performance upper bound (signal-to-distortion ratio) for arbitrary code length is also derived and Zero-delay cooperative JSCC is briefly addressed in order to provide an approximate bound on the performance of zero-delay schemes. The main contribution is a nonlinear hybrid discrete-analog JSSC scheme based on distributed quantization and a linear continuous mapping named Distributed Quantizer Linear Coder (DQLC). The DQLC has promising performance which improves with increasing correlation, and is robust against variations in noise level. The DQLC exhibits a constant gap to the performance upper bound as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes large for any number of sources and values of correlation. Therefore it outperforms a linear solution (uncoded transmission) in any case when the SNR gets sufficiently large.
