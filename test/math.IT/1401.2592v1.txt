In a K-user Gaussian interference channel, it has been shown that if for each user the desired signal strength is no less than the sum of the strengths of the strongest interference from this user and the strongest interference to this user (all values in dB scale), then treating interference as noise (TIN) is optimal from the perspective of generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF) and achieves the entire channel capacity region to within a constant gap. In this work, we show that for such TIN-optimal interference channels, even if the message set is expanded to include an independent message from each transmitter to each receiver, operating the new channel as the original interference channel and treating interference as noise is still optimal for the sum capacity up to a constant gap. Furthermore, we extend the result to the sum-GDoF optimality of TIN in the general setting of X channels with arbitrary numbers of transmitters and receivers.
