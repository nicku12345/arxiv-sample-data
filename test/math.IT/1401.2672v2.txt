In this paper, we introduce a model of a single-failure locally recoverable distributed storage system. This model appears to give rise to a problem seemingly dual of the well-studied index coding problem. The relation between the dimensions of an optimal index code and optimal distributed storage code of our model has been established in this paper. We also show some extensions to vector codes.
