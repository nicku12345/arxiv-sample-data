Erasure list decoding was introduced to correct a larger number of erasures with output of a list of possible candidates. In the present paper, we consider both random linear codes and algebraic geometry codes for list decoding erasure errors. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, we show that, for arbitrary 0<R<1 and \epsilon>0 (R and \epsilon are independent), with high probability a random linear code is an erasure list decodable code with constant list size 2^{O(1/\epsilon)} that can correct a fraction 1-R-\epsilon of erasures, i.e., a random linear code achieves the information-theoretic optimal trade-off between information rate and fraction of erasure errors. Secondly, we show that algebraic geometry codes are good erasure list-decodable codes. Precisely speaking, for any 0<R<1 and \epsilon>0, a q-ary algebraic geometry code of rate R from the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower can correct 1-R-\frac{1}{\sqrt{q}-1}+\frac{1}{q}-\epsilon fraction of erasure errors with list size O(1/\epsilon). This improves the Johnson bound applied to algebraic geometry codes. Furthermore, list decoding of these algebraic geometry codes can be implemented in polynomial time.
