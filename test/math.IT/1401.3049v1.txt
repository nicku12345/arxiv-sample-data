In this paper, we study the problem of physical layer security in a large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (LS-MIMO) relaying system. The advantage of LS-MIMO relaying systems is exploited to enhance both wireless security and spectral efficiency. In particular, the challenging issue incurred by short interception distance is well addressed. Under very practical assumptions, i.e., no eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and imperfect legitimate channel CSI, this paper gives a thorough investigation of the impact of imperfect CSI in two classic relaying systems, i.e., amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) systems, and obtain explicit expressions of secrecy outage capacities for both cases. Finally, our theoretical claims are validated by the numerical results.
