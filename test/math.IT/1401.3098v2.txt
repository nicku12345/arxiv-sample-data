In this work we investigate the network MIMO techniques of interference alignment (IA) and fully adaptive joint transmission coordinated multipoint (CoMP) in an indoor very small cell environment. Our focus is on the overheads in a system with quantized channel state feedback from the receiver to the transmitter (based on the 802.11ac standard) and on the impact of non-ideal hardware. The indoor office scenario should be the most favourable case in terms of the required feedback rates due to the large coherence bandwidth and coherence time of the channel. The evaluations are done using a real-world wireless testbed with three BSs and three MSs all having two antennas. The signal to noise ratio in the measurements is very high, 35-60dB, due to the short transmission range. Under such conditions radio hardware impairments becomes a major limitation on the performance. We quantify the impact of these impairments. For a 23ms update interval the overhead is 2.5% and IA and CoMP improves the sum throughput 27% and 47% in average (over the reference schemes e.g. TDMA MIMO), under stationary conditions. When two people are walking in the measurement area the throughput improvements drops to 16% and 45%, respectively.
