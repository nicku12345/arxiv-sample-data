We present a modified compute-and-forward scheme which utilizes Channel State Information at the Transmitters (CSIT) in a natural way. The modified scheme allows different users to have different coding rates, and use CSIT to achieve larger rate region. This idea is applicable to all systems which use the compute-and-forward technique and can be arbitrarily better than the regular scheme in some settings.
