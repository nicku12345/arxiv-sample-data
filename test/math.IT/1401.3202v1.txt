We present bounds and a closed-form high-SNR expression for the capacity of multiple-antenna systems affected by Wiener phase noise. Our results are developed for the scenario where a single oscillator drives all the radio-frequency circuitries at each transceiver (common oscillator setup), the input signal is subject to a peak-power constraint, and the channel matrix is deterministic. This scenario is relevant for line-of-sight multiple-antenna microwave backhaul links with sufficiently small antenna spacing at the transceivers. For the 2 by 2 multiple-antenna case, for a Wiener phase-noise process with standard deviation equal to 6 degrees, and at the medium/high SNR values at which microwave backhaul links operate, the upper bound reported in the paper exhibits a 3 dB gap from a lower bound obtained using 64-QAM. Furthermore, in this SNR regime the closed-form high-SNR expression is shown to be accurate.
