The problem of jamming on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian channels is investigated in this paper. In the case of a single target legitimate signal, we show that the existing result based on the simplification of the system model by neglecting the jamming channel leads to losing important insights regarding the effect of jamming power and jamming channel on the jamming strategy. We find a closed-form optimal solution for the problem under a positive semi-definite (PSD) condition without considering simplifications in the model. If the condition is not satisfied and the optimal solution may not exist in closed-form, we find the optimal solution using a numerical method and also propose a suboptimal solution in closed-form as a close approximation of the optimal solution. Then, the possibility of extending the results to solve the problem of multi-target jamming is investigated for four scenarios, i.e., multiple access channel, broadcasting channel, multiple transceiver pairs with orthogonal transmissions, and multiple transceiver pairs with interference, respectively. It is shown that the proposed numerical method can be extended to all scenarios while the proposed closed-form solutions for jamming may be applied in the scenarios of the multiple access channel and multiple transceiver pairs with orthogonal transmissions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
