Diffusion-based molecular communication over nanonetworks is an emerging communication paradigm that enables nanomachines to communicate by using molecules as the information carrier. For such a communication paradigm, Concentration Shift Keying (CSK) has been considered as one of the most promising techniques for modulating information symbols, owing to its inherent simplicity and practicality. CSK modulated subsequent information symbols, however, may interfere with each other due to the random amount of time that molecules of each modulated symbols take to reach the receiver nanomachine. To alleviate Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) problem associated with CSK, we propose a new modulation technique called Zebra-CSK. The proposed Zebra-CSK adds inhibitor molecules in CSK-modulated molecular signal to selectively suppress ISI causing molecules. Numerical results from our newly developed probabilistic analytical model show that Zebra-CSK not only enhances capacity of the molecular channel but also reduces symbol error probability observed at the receiver nanomachine.
