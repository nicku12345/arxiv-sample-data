In a full-duplex 3-way \Delta channel, three transceivers communicate to each other, so that a number of six messages is exchanged. In a Y-channel, however, these three transceivers are connected to an intermediate full-duplex relay. Loop-back self-interference is suppressed perfectly. The relay forwards network-coded messages to their dedicated users by means of interference alignment (IA) and signal alignment. A conceptual channel model with cyclic shifts described by a polynomial ring is considered for these two related channels. The maximally achievable rates in terms of the degrees of freedom measure are derived. We observe that the Y-channel and the 3-way \Delta channel provide a Y-\Delta product relationship. Moreover, we briefly discuss how this analysis relates to spatial IA and MIMO IA.
