Suppose {\bf x} is any exactly k-sparse vector in \mathbb{C}^{n}. We present a class of phase measurement matrix A in \mathbb{C}^{m\times n}, and a corresponding algorithm, called SUPER, that can resolve {\bf x} up to a global phase from intensity measurements |A{\bf x}| with high probability over A. Here |A{\bf x}| is a vector of component-wise magnitudes of A{\bf x}. The SUPER algorithm is the first to simultaneously have the following properties: (a) it requires only {\cal O}(k) (order-optimal) measurements, (b) the computational complexity of decoding is {\cal O}(k\log k) (near order-optimal) arithmetic operations.
