In many practical applications such as direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and line spectral estimation, the sparsifying dictionary is usually characterized by a set of unknown parameters in a continuous domain. To apply the conventional compressed sensing to such applications, the continuous parameter space has to be discretized to a finite set of grid points. Discretization, however, incurs errors and leads to deteriorated recovery performance. To address this issue, we propose an iterative reweighted method which jointly estimates the unknown parameters and the sparse signals. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is developed by iteratively decreasing a surrogate function majorizing a given objective function, which results in a gradual and interweaved iterative process to refine the unknown parameters and the sparse signal. Numerical results show that the algorithm provides superior performance in resolving closely-spaced frequency components.
