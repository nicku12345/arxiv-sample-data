This paper addresses the topic of robust Bayesian compressed sensing over finite fields. For stationary and ergodic sources, it provides asymptotic (with the size of the vector to estimate) necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of required measurements to achieve vanishing reconstruction error, in presence of sensing and communication noise. In all considered cases, the necessary and sufficient conditions asymptotically coincide. Conditions on the sparsity of the sensing matrix are established in presence of communication noise. Several previously published results are generalized and extended.
