Motivated by the rank modulation scheme, a recent work by Sala and Dolecek explored the study of constraint codes for permutations. The constraint studied by them is inherited by the inter-cell interference phenomenon in flash memories, where high-level cells can inadvertently increase the level of low-level cells.   In this paper, the model studied by Sala and Dolecek is extended into two constraints. A permutation \sigma \in S_n satisfies the \emph{two-neighbor k-constraint} if for all 2 \leq i \leq n-1 either |\sigma(i-1)-\sigma(i)|\leq k or |\sigma(i)-\sigma(i+1)|\leq k, and it satisfies the \emph{asymmetric two-neighbor k-constraint} if for all 2 \leq i \leq n-1, either \sigma(i-1)-\sigma(i) < k or \sigma(i+1)-\sigma(i) < k. We show that the capacity of the first constraint is (1+\epsilon)/2 in case that k=\Theta(n^{\epsilon}) and the capacity of the second constraint is 1 regardless to the value of k. We also extend our results and study the capacity of these two constraints combined with error-correction codes in the Kendall's \tau metric.
