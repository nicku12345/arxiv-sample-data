Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is an inter-cell interference coordination scheme that is being actively researched for emerging wireless cellular networks. In this work, we consider hexagonal tessellation based planned FFR deployments, and derive expressions for the coverage probability and normalized average rate for the downlink. In particular, given reuse \frac{1}{3} (FR3 ) and reuse 1 (FR1) regions, and a Signal-to-Interference-plus-noise-Ratio (SINR) threshold S_{th} which decides the user assignment to either the FR1 or FR3 regions, we theoretically show that: (i) The optimal choice of S_{th} which maximizes the coverage probability is S_{th} = T, where T is the required target SINR (for ensuring coverage), and (ii) The optimal choice of S_{th} which maximizes the normalized average rate is given by the expression S_{th}=\max(T, T'), where T' is a function of the path loss exponent and the fade parameters. For the optimal choice of S_{th}, we show that FFR gives a higher rate than FR1 and a better coverage probability than FR3. The impact of frequency correlation over the sub-bands allocated to the FR1 and FR3 regions is analysed, and it is shown that correlation decreases the average rate of the FFR network. Numerical results are provided, and these match with the analytical results.
