Coverage probability and rate expressions are theoretically compared for the following cases: (i). Both the user channel and the N interferers are independent and non identical Nakagami-m distributed random variables (RVs). (ii). The N interferers are correlated Nakagami-m RVs. It is analytically shown that the coverage probability in the presence of correlated interferers is greater than or equal to the coverage probability in the presence of non-identical independent interferers when the shape parameter of the channel between the user and its base station is not greater than one. It is further analytically shown that the average rate in the presence of correlated interferers is greater than or equal to the average rate in the presence of non-identical independent interferers. Simulation results are provided and these match with the obtained theoretical results. The utility of our results are also discussed.
