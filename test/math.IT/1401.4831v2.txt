We apply several state-of-the-art techniques developed in recent advances of counting algorithms and statistical physics to study the spatial mixing property of the two-dimensional codes arising from local hard (independent set) constraints, including: hard-square, hard-hexagon, read/write isolated memory (RWIM), and non-attacking kings (NAK). For these constraints, the strong spatial mixing would imply the existence of polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for computing the capacity. It was previously known for the hard-square constraint the existence of strong spatial mixing and PTAS. We show the existence of strong spatial mixing for hard-hexagon and RWIM constraints by establishing the strong spatial mixing along self-avoiding walks, and consequently we give PTAS for computing the capacities of these codes. We also show that for the NAK constraint, the strong spatial mixing does not hold along self-avoiding walks.
