In this paper, a new proof for the degrees of freedom (DoF) region of the K-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) with no channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and perfect channel state information at the receivers (CSIR) is provided. Based on this proof, the capacity region of a certain class of MIMO BC with channel distribution information at the transmitter (CDIT) and perfect CSIR is derived. Finally, an outer bound for the DoF region of the MIMO interference channel (IC) with no CSIT is provided.
