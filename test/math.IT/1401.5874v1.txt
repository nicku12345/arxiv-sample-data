Let \underline{a} and \underline{b} be primitive sequences over \mathbb{Z}/(p^e) with odd prime p and e\ge 2. For certain compressing maps, we consider the distribution properties of compressing sequences of \underline{a} and \underline{b}, and prove that \underline{a}=\underline{b} if the compressing sequences are equal at the times t such that \alpha(t)=k, where \underline{\alpha} is a sequence related to \underline{a}. We also discuss the s-uniform distribution property of compressing sequences. For some compressing maps, we have that there exist different primitive sequences such that the compressing sequences are s-uniform. We also discuss that compressing sequences can be s-uniform for how many elements s.
