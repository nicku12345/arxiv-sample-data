Spatial coupling was proved to improve the belief-propagation (BP) performance up to the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) performance. This paper addresses an extended class of spatially coupled (SC) systems. A potential function is derived for characterizing a lower bound on the BP performance of the extended SC systems, and shown to be different from the potential for the conventional SC systems. This may imply that the BP performance for the extended SC systems does not coincide with the MAP performance for the corresponding uncoupled system. SC bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) is also investigated as an application of the extended SC systems.
