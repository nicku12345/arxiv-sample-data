Now-a-days, intense research is going on two-hop wireless link under different fading conditions with its remedial measures. In this paper work, a two-hop link under three different conditions is considered: (i) MIMO on both hops, (ii) MISO in first hop and SIMO in second hop and finally (iii) SIMO in first hop and MISO in second hop. The three models used here give the flexibility of using STBC (Space Time Block Coding) and combining scheme on any of the source to relay (S- R) and relay to destination (R-D) link. Even incorporation of Transmitting Antenna Selection (TAS) is possible on any link. Here, the variation of SER (Symbol Error Rate) is determined against mean SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of R-D link for three different modulation schemes: BPSK, 8-PSK and 16-PSK, taking the number of antennas and SNR of S-R link as parameters under Nakagami -m fading condition.
