A new generalised approach for multiple correlated sources over a wiretap network is investigated. A basic model consisting of two correlated sources where each produce a component of the common information is initially investigated. There are several cases that consider wiretapped syndromes on the transmission links and based on these cases a new quantity, the information leakage at the source/s is determined. An interesting feature of the models described in this paper is the information leakage quantification. Shannon's cipher system with eavesdroppers is incorporated into the two correlated sources model to minimize key lengths. These aspects of quantifying information leakage and reducing key lengths using Shannon's cipher system are also considered for a multiple correlated source network approach. A new scheme that incorporates masking using common information combinations to reduce the key lengths is presented and applied to the generalised model for multiple sources.
