Consider the following framework of universal decoding suggested in [MerhavUniversal]. Given a family of decoding metrics and random coding distribution (prior), a single, universal, decoder is optimal if for any possible channel the average error probability when using this decoder is better than the error probability attained by the best decoder in the family up to a subexponential multiplicative factor. We describe a general universal decoder in this framework. The penalty for using this universal decoder is computed. The universal metric is constructed as follows. For each metric, a canonical metric is defined and conditions for the given prior to be normal are given. A sub-exponential set of canonical metrics of normal prior can be merged to a single universal optimal metric. We provide an example where this decoder is optimal while the decoder of [MerhavUniversal] is not.
