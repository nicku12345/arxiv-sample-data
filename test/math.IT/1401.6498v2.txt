In this paper, we propose a new cooperation model for discrete memoryless multiple access channels. Unlike in prior cooperation models (e.g., conferencing encoders), where the transmitters cooperate directly, in this model the transmitters cooperate through a larger network. We show that under this indirect cooperation model, there exist channels for which the increase in sum-capacity resulting from cooperation is significantly larger than the rate shared by the transmitters to establish the cooperation. This result contrasts both with results on the benefit of cooperation under prior models and results in the network coding literature, where attempts to find examples in which similar small network modifications yield large capacity benefits have to date been unsuccessful.
