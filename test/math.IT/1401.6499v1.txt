In this paper, we consider transmitter optimization in multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel with common and secret messages. The secret message is intended for K users and it is transmitted with perfect secrecy with respect to J eavesdroppers which are also assumed to be legitimate users in the network. The common message is transmitted at a fixed rate R_{0} and it is intended for all K users and J eavesdroppers. The source operates under a total power constraint. It also injects artificial noise to improve the secrecy rate. We obtain the optimum covariance matrices associated with the common message, secret message, and artificial noise, which maximize the achievable secrecy rate and simultaneously meet the fixed rate R_{0} for the common message.
