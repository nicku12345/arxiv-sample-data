The possible state space dimension increases exponentially with respect to the number of qubits. This feature makes the quantum state tomography expensive and impractical for identifying the state of merely several qubits. The recent developed approach, compressed sensing, gives us an alternative to estimate the quantum state with fewer measurements. It is proved that the estimation then can be converted to a convex optimization problem with quantum mechanics constraints. In this paper we present an alternating augmented Lagrangian method for quantum convex optimization problem aiming for recovering pure or near pure quantum states corrupted by sparse noise given observables and the expectation values of the measurements. The proposed algorithm is much faster, robust to outlier noises (even very large for some entries) and can solve the reconstruction problem distributively. The simulations verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm and compare it to the conventional least square and compressive quantum tomography using Dantzig method.
