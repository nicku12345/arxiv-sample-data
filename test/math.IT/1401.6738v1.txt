This paper establishes the capacity region of a class of broadcast channels with random state in which each channel component is selected from two possible functions and each receiver knows its state sequence. This channel model does not fit into any class of broadcast channels for which the capacity region was previously known and is useful in studying wireless communication channels when the fading state is known only at the receivers. The capacity region is shown to coincide with the UV outer bound and is achieved via Marton coding.
