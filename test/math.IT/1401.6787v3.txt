This paper studies the capacity of the peak-and-average-power-limited Gaussian channel when its output is quantized using a dithered, infinite-level, uniform quantizer of step size \Delta. It is shown that the capacity of this channel tends to that of the unquantized Gaussian channel when \Delta tends to zero, and it tends to zero when \Delta tends to infinity. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, it is shown that, when the peak-power constraint is absent, the low-SNR asymptotic capacity is equal to that of the unquantized channel irrespective of \Delta. Furthermore, an expression for the low-SNR asymptotic capacity for finite peak-to-average-power ratios is given and evaluated in the low- and high-resolution limit. It is demonstrated that, in this case, the low-SNR asymptotic capacity converges to that of the unquantized channel when \Delta tends to zero, and it tends to zero when \Delta tends to infinity. Comparing these results with achievability results for (undithered) 1-bit quantization, it is observed that the dither reduces capacity in the low-precision limit, and it reduces the low-SNR asymptotic capacity unless the peak-to-average-power ratio is unbounded.
