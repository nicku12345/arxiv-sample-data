This paper derives fundamental limits on the performance of compressive classification when the source is a mixture of Gaussians. It provides an asymptotic analysis of a Bhattacharya based upper bound on the misclassification probability for the optimal Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) classifier that depends on quantities that are dual to the concepts of diversity-order and coding gain in multi-antenna communications. The diversity-order of the measurement system determines the rate at which the probability of misclassification decays with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the low-noise regime. The counterpart of coding gain is the measurement gain which determines the power offset of the probability of misclassification in the low-noise regime. These two quantities make it possible to quantify differences in misclassification probability between random measurement and (diversity-order) optimized measurement. Results are presented for two-class classification problems first with zero-mean Gaussians then with nonzero-mean Gaussians, and finally for multiple-class Gaussian classification problems. The behavior of misclassification probability is revealed to be intimately related to certain fundamental geometric quantities determined by the measurement system, the source and their interplay. Numerical results, representative of compressive classification of a mixture of Gaussians, demonstrate alignment of the actual misclassification probability with the Bhattacharya based upper bound. The connection between the misclassification performance and the alignment between source and measurement geometry may be used to guide the design of dictionaries for compressive classification.
