In many wireless systems, the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) can not be learned until after a transmission has taken place and is thereby outdated. In this paper, we study the benefits of delayed CSIT on a block-fading channel at finite blocklength. First, the achievable rates of a family of codes that allows the number of codewords to expand during transmission, based on delayed CSIT, are characterized. A fixed-length and a variable-length characterization of the rates are provided using the dependency testing bound and the variable-length setting introduced by Polyanskiy et al. Next, a communication protocol based on codes with expandable message space is put forth, and numerically, it is shown that higher rates are achievable compared to coding strategies that do not benefit from delayed CSIT.
