Capacity computations are presented for Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling in the presence of interference from neighboring frequency bands. It is shown that Shannon's sinc pulses maximize the spectral efficiency for a multi-access channel, where spectral efficiency is defined as the sum rate in bits per second per Hertz. Comparisons using root raised cosine pulses show that the spectral efficiency decreases monotonically with the roll-off factor. At high signal-to-noise ratio, these pulses have an additive gap to capacity that increases monotonically with the roll-off factor.
