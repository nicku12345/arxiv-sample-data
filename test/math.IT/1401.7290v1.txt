We study LDPC codes for the channel with input {x}\in \mathbb{F}_q^m and output {y}={x}+{z}\in \mathbb{F}_q^m. The aim of this paper is to evaluate decoding performance of q^m-ary non-binary LDPC codes for large m. We give density evolution and decoding performance evaluation for regular non-binary LDPC codes and spatially-coupled (SC) codes. We show the regular codes do not achieve the capacity of the channel while SC codes do.
