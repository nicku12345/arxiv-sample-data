We will discuss superimposed codes and non-adaptive group testing designs arising from the potentialities of compressed genotyping models in molecular biology. The given paper was motivated by the 30th anniversary of D'yachkov-Rykov recurrent upper bound on the rate of superimposed codes published in 1982. We were also inspired by recent results obtained for non-adaptive threshold group testing which develop the theory of superimposed codes
