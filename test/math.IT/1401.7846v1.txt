In this paper, the problem of optimal power allocation in Cognitive Radio (CR) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems is treated. The focus is on providing limited feedback solutions aiming at maximizing the secondary system rate subject to a constraint on the average interference caused to primary communication. The limited feedback solutions are obtained by reducing the information available at secondary transmitter (STx) for the link between STx and the secondary receiver (SRx) as well as by limiting the level of available information at STx that corresponds to the link between the STx and the primary receiver PRx. Monte Carlo simulation results are given that allow to quanitfy the performance achieved by the proposed algorithms.
