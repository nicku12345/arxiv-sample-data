In this paper, we propose a recursive method for finding Costas arrays that relies on a particular formation of Costas arrays from similar patterns of smaller size. By using such an idea, the proposed algorithm is able to dramatically reduce the computational burden (when compared to the exhaustive search), and at the same time, still can find all possible Costas arrays of given size. Similar to exhaustive search, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented in parallel computing. The efficiency of the method is discussed based on theoretical and numerical results.
