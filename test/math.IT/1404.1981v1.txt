We propose an Iterative Detection and Decoding (IDD) scheme with Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems for block-fading F = 2 and fast fading Rayleigh channels. An IDD receiver with soft information processing that exploits the code structure and the behaviour of the log likelihood ratios (LLR)'s is developed. Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) and with Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) schemes are considered. The soft \textit{a posteriori} output of the decoder in a block-fading channel with Root-Check LDPC codes has allowed us to create a new strategy to improve the Bit Error Rate (BER) of a MIMO IDD scheme. Our proposed strategy in some scenarios has resulted in up to 3dB of gain in terms of BER for block-fading channels and up to 1dB in fast fading channels.
