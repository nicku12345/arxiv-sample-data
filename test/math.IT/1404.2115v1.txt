This paper presents a physical model for Single Carrier-Frequency Division Mutliple Access (SC-FDMA). We specifically show that by using mutlirate signal processing we derive a general time domain description of Localised SC-FDMA systems relying on circular convolution. This general model has the advantage of encompassing different implementations with flexible rates as well as additional frequency precoding such as spectral shaping. Based on this time-domain model, we study the Power Spectral Density (PSD) and the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR). Different implementations of SC-FDMA are investigated and analytical expressions of both PSD and SINR compared to simulations results.
