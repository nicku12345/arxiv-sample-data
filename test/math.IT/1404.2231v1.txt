Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the parity-based approach for distributed joint source channel coding (DJSCC) with decoder side information is described in this paper. The parity-based approach is theoretical limit achievable. Different edge degree distributions are used for source variable nodes and parity variable nodes. Particularly, the codeword-averaged density evolution (CADE) is presented for asymmetrically correlated nonuniform sources over the asymmetric memoryless transmission channel. Extensive simulations show that the splitting of variable nodes can improve the coding efficiency of suboptimal codes and lower the error floor.
