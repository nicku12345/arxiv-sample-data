In this paper, the posterior matching scheme proposed by Shayevits and Feder is extended to the Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback, and the error probabilities and achievable rate region are derived for this coding strategy by using the iterated random function theory. A variant of the Ozarow-Leung code for the general two-user broadcast channel with feedback can be realized as a special case of our coding scheme. Furthermore, for the symmetric Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback, our coding scheme achieves the linear-feedback sum-capacity like the LQG code and outperforms the Kramer code.
