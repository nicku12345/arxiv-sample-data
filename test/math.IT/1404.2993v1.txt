In this paper, we obtain a new class of p-ary binomial bent functions which are determined by Kloosterman sums. The bentness of another three classes of functions is characterized by some exponential sums and some results in \cite{Linian2013} are generalized. Furthermore we obtain, in some special cases, some bent functions are determined by Kloosterman sums.
