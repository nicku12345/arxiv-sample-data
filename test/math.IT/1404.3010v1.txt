We consider the uplink of a multiuser massive MIMO system wherein a base station (BS) having M antennas communicates coherently with K single antenna user terminals (UTs). We study the energy efficiency of this system while taking the transceiver power consumption at the UTs and the BS into consideration. For a given spectral efficiency R and fixed transceiver power consumption parameters, we propose and analyze the problem of maximizing the energy efficiency as a function of (M,K). For the maximum ratio combining (MRC) detector at the BS we show that with increasing R, (M,K) can be adaptively increased in such a way that the energy efficiency converges to a positive constant as R \rightarrow \infty ((M,K) is increased in such a way that a constant per-user spectral efficiency R/K is maintained). This is in contrast to the fixed (M,K) scenario where the energy efficiency is known to converge to zero as R \rightarrow \infty. We also observe that for large R, the optimal (M,K) maximizing the energy efficiency is such that, the total power consumed by the power amplifiers (PA) in all the K UTs is a small fraction of the total system power consumption.
