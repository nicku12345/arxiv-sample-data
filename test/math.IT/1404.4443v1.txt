The market trends towards the use of smaller dish antennas for TV satellite receivers, as well as the growing density of broadcasting satellites in orbit require the application of robust adjacent satellite interference (ASI) cancellation algorithms at the receivers. The wider beamwidth of a small size dish and the growing number of satellites in orbit impose an overloaded scenario, i.e., a scenario where the number of transmitting satellites exceeds the number of receiving antennas. For such a scenario, we present a two stage receiver to enhance signal detection from the satellite of interest, i.e., the satellite that the dish is pointing to, while reducing interference from neighboring satellites. Towards this objective, we propose an enhanced List-based Group-wise Search Detection (LGSD) receiver architecture that takes into account the spatially correlated additive noise and uses the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) maximization criterion to improve detection performance. Simulations show that the proposed receiver structure enhances the performance of satellite systems in the presence of ASI when compared to existing methods.
