We investigate the secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) of a two-transmitter Gaussian multiple access channel with multiple antennas at the transmitters, the legitimate receiver with the existence of an unknown number of eavesdroppers each with a number of antennas less than or equal to a known value N_E. The channel matrices between the legitimate transmitters and the receiver are available everywhere, while the legitimate pair does not know the eavesdroppers' channels matrices. We provide the exact sum SDoF for the considered system. A new comprehensive upperbound is deduced and a new achievable scheme based on utilizing jamming is exploited. We prove that Cooperative Jamming is SDoF optimal even without the instantaneous eavesdropper CSI available at the transmitters.
