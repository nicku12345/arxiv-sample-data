We study correlated jamming in joint source-channel communication systems. An i.i.d. source is to be communicated over a memoryless channel in the presence of a correlated jammer with non-causal knowledge of user transmission. This user-jammer interaction is modeled as a zero sum game. A set of conditions on the source and the channel is provided for the existence of a Nash equilibrium for this game, where the user strategy is uncoded transmission and the jammer strategy is i.i.d jamming. This generalizes a well-known example of uncoded communication of a Gaussian sources over Gaussian channels with additive jamming. Another example, of a Binary Symmetric source over a Binary Symmetric channel with jamming, is provided as a validation of this result.
