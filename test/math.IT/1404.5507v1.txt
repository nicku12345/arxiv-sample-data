We study the problem of channel resolvability for fixed i.i.d. input distributions and discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), and derive the strong converse theorem for any DMCs that are not necessarily full rank. We also derive the optimal second-order rate under a condition. Furthermore, under the condition that a DMC has the unique capacity achieving input distribution, we derive the optimal second-order rate of channel resolvability for the worst input distribution.
