We show how Gabidulin codes can be list decoded by using a parametrization approach. For this we consider a certain module in the ring of linearized polynomials and find a minimal basis for this module using the Euclidean algorithm with respect to composition of polynomials. For a given received word, our decoding algorithm computes a list of all codewords that are closest to the received word with respect to the rank metric.
