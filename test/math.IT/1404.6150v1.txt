This paper describes a direct conversion receiver applying compressed sensing with the objective to relax the analog filtering requirements seen in the traditional architecture. The analog filter is cumbersome in an \gls{IC} design and relaxing its requirements is an advantage in terms of die area, performance and robustness of the receiver. The objective is met by a selection of sampling pattern matched to the prior knowledge of the frequency placement of the desired and interfering signals. A simple numerical example demonstrates the principle. The work is part of an ongoing research effort and the different project phases are explained.
