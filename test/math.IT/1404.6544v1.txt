The recent commercial trends towards using smaller dish antennas for satellite receivers, and the growing density of broadcasting satellites, necessitate the application of robust adjacent satellite interference (ASI) cancellation schemes. This orbital density growth along with the wider beamwidth of a smaller dish have imposed an overloaded scenario at the satellite receiver, where the number of transmitting satellites exceeds the number of receiving elements at the dish antenna. To ensure successful operation in this practical scenario, we propose a satellite receiver that enhances signal detection from the desired satellite by mitigating the interference from neighboring satellites. Towards this objective, we propose a reduced complexity list-based group-wise search detection (RC-LGSD) receiver under the assumption of spatially correlated additive noise. To further enhance detection performance, the proposed satellite receiver utilizes a newly designed whitening filter to remove the spatial correlation amongst the noise parameters, while also applying a preprocessor that maximizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Extensive simulations under practical scenarios show that the proposed receiver enhances the performance of satellite broadcast systems in the presence of ASI compared to existing methods.
