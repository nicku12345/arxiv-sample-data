With millimeter wave bands emerging as a strong candidate for 5G cellular networks, next-generation systems may be in a unique position where spectrum is plentiful. To assess the potential value of this spectrum, this paper derives scaling laws on the per mobile downlink feasible rate with large bandwidth and number of nodes, for both Infrastructure Single Hop (ISH) and Infrastructure Multi-Hop (IMH) architectures. It is shown that, for both cases, there exist \emph{critical bandwidth scalings} above which increasing the bandwidth no longer increases the feasible rate per node. These critical thresholds coincide exactly with the bandwidths where, for each architecture, the network transitions from being degrees-of-freedom-limited to power-limited. For ISH, this critical bandwidth threshold is lower than IMH when the number of users per base station grows with network size. This result suggests that multi-hop transmissions may be necessary to fully exploit large bandwidth degrees of freedom in deployments with growing number of users per cell.
