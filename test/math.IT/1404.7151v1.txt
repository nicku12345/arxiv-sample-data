Min-Sum decoding is widely used for decoding LDPC codes in many modern digital video broadcasting decoding due to its relative low complexity and robustness against quantization error. However, the suboptimal performance of the Min-Sum affects the integrated performance of wireless receivers. In this paper, we present the idea of adapting the scaling factor of the Min-Sum decoder with iterations through a simple approximation. For the ease of implementation the scaling factor can be changed in a staircase fashion. The stair step is designed to optimize the decoder performance and the required storage for its different values. The variable scaling factor proposed algorithm produces a non-trivial improvement of the performance of the Min-Sum decoding as verified by simulation results.
