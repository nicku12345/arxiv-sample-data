In this paper, the Cramer Rao bound (CRB) for range estimation between two underwater nodes is calculated under a Gaussian noise assumption on the measurements. The nodes can measure their depths, their mutual time of flight, and they have access to noisy sound speed samples at different depths. The effect of each measurement on the CRB will be analyzed, and it will be shown that for long distances, the effect of the sound speed measurement noise is dominant, and its impact depends on the positions of the nodes, actual sound speed profile, the number of sound speed samples, and the depths at which the sound speed samples are gathered.
