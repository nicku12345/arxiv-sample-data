Subspace codes have received an increasing interest recently due to their application in error-correction for random network coding. In particular, cyclic subspace codes are possible candidates for large codes with efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. In this paper we consider such cyclic codes and provide constructions of optimal codes for which their codewords do not have full orbits. We further introduce a new way to represent subspace codes by a class of polynomials called subspace polynomials. We present some constructions of such codes which are cyclic and analyze their parameters.
