OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)provides the promising physical layer for 4G and 3GPP LTE Systems in terms of efficient use of bandwidth and data rates. This paper highlights the implementation of OFDM in Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T). It mainly focuses on the timing offset problem present in OFDM systems and its proposed solution using Cyclic Prefix (CP) as a modified SC (Schmidl and COX) algorithm. It also highlights the timing synchronization as well as performance comparison through bit error rate. Synchronization issues in OFDM are important and can lead to information loss if not properly addressed. Simulations were performed to implement DVB-T system and to compare different synchronization methods under certain distribution model.
