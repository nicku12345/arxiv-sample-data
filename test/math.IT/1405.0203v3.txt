We study the capacity region of the two-user Binary Fading (or Erasure) Interference Channel where the transmitters have no knowledge of the channel state information. We develop new inner-bounds and outer-bounds for this problem. We identify three regimes based on the channel parameters: weak, moderate, and strong interference regimes. Interestingly, this is similar to the generalized degrees of freedom of the two-user Gaussian interference channel where transmitters have perfect channel knowledge. We show that for the weak interference regime, treating interference as erasure is optimal while for the strong interference regime, decoding interference is optimal. For the moderate interference regime, we provide new inner and outer bounds. The inner-bound is based on a modification of the Han-Kobayashi scheme for the erasure channel, enhanced by time-sharing. We study the gap between our inner-bound and our outer-bounds for the moderate interference regime and compare our results to that of the Gaussian interference channel. Deriving our new outer-bounds has three main steps. We first create a contracted channel that has fewer states compared to the original channel, in order to make the analysis tractable. We then prove the Correlation Lemma that shows an outer-bound on the capacity region of the contracted channel also serves as an outer-bound for the original channel. Finally using the Conditional Entropy Leakage Lemma, we derive our outer-bound on the capacity region of the contracted channel.
