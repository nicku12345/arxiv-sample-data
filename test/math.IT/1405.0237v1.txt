In this paper, we provide a new approach to estimating the error of reconstruction from \Sigma\Delta quantized compressed sensing measurements.   Our method is based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) of a certain projection of the measurement matrix.   Our result yields simple proofs and a slight generalization of the best-known reconstruction error bounds for Gaussian and subgaussian measurement matrices.
