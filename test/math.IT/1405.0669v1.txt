In this work we study the effect of oscillator phase noise on the uplink performance of a massive multiple-input multiple output system. Specifically, we consider an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based uplink transmission and analyze two scenarios: (a) all the base station (BS) antennas are fed by a common oscillator, and (b) each of the BS antennas is fed by a different oscillator. For the scenarios considered, we derive the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio on each subcarrier and analyze the ergodic capacity when a linear receiver is used. Furthermore, we propose a phase noise tracking algorithm based on Kalman filtering that mitigates the effect of phase noise on the system performance.
