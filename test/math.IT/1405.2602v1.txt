Let R be a finite commutative chain ring with unique maximal ideal \langle \gamma\rangle, and let n be a positive integer coprime with the characteristic of R/\langle \gamma\rangle. In this paper, the algebraic structure of cyclic codes of length n over R is investigated. Some new necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of nontrivial self-dual cyclic codes are provided. An enumeration formula for the self-dual cyclic codes is also studied.
