This paper addresses the problem of measuring complexity from embedded attractors as a way to characterize changes in the dynamical behaviour of different types of systems by observing their outputs. With the aim of measuring the stability of the trajectories of the attractor along time, this paper proposes three new estimations of entropy that are derived from a Markov model of the embedded attractor.
