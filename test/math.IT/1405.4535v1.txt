A set \{a_i\:|\: 1\leq i \leq k\} of non-negative integers is a Golomb ruler if differences a_i-a_j, for any i \neq j, are all distinct. A set of I disjoint Golomb rulers (DGR) each being a J-subset of \{1,2,\cdots, n\} is called an (I,J,n)-DGR. Let H(I, J) be the least positive n such that there is an (I,J,n)-DGR. In this paper, we propose a series of conjectures on the constructions and structures of DGR. The main conjecture states that if A is any set of positive integers such that |A| = H(I, J), then there are I disjoint Golomb rulers, each being a J-subset of A, which generalizes the conjecture proposed by Koml{\'o}s, Sulyok and Szemer{\'e}di in 1975 on the special case I = 1. These conjectures are computationally verified for some values of I and J through modest computation. Eighteen exact values of H(I,J) and ten upper bounds on H(I,J) are obtained by computer search for 7 \leq I \leq 13 and 10 \leq J \leq 13. Moveover for I > 13 and 10 \leq J \leq 13, H(I,J)=IJ are determined without difficulty.
