Transmitter switching can provide resiliency and robustness to a communication system with multiple energy harvesting transmitters. However, excessive transmitter switching will bring heavy control overhead. In this paper, a geometric projection-based transmitter switching policy is proposed for a communication system with multiple energy harvesting transmitters and one receiver, which can reduce the number of switches. The results show that the proposed transmitter switching policy outperforms several heuristic ones.
