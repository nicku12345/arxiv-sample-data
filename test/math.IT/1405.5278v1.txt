Let m, k be positive integers, p be an odd prime and \pi  be a primitive element of \mathbb{F}_{p^m}. In this paper, we determine the weight distribution of a family of cyclic codes \mathcal{C}_t over \mathbb{F}_p, whose duals have two zeros \pi^{-t} and -\pi^{-t}, where t satisfies t\equiv \frac{p^k+1}{2}p^\tau \ ({\rm mod}\ \frac{p^m-1}{2})  for some \tau \in \{0,1,\cdots, m-1\}.
