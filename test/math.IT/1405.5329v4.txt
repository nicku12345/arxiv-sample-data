The amount of information lost in sub-Nyquist sampling of a continuous-time Gaussian stationary process is quantified. We consider a combined source coding and sub-Nyquist reconstruction problem in which the input to the encoder is a noisy sub-Nyquist sampled version of the analog source. We first derive an expression for the mean squared error in the reconstruction of the process from a noisy and information rate-limited version of its samples. This expression is a function of the sampling frequency and the average number of bits describing each sample. It is given as the sum of two terms: Minimum mean square error in estimating the source from its noisy but otherwise fully observed sub-Nyquist samples, and a second term obtained by reverse waterfilling over an average of spectral densities associated with the polyphase components of the source. We extend this result to multi-branch uniform sampling, where the samples are available through a set of parallel channels with a uniform sampler and a pre-sampling filter in each branch. Further optimization to reduce distortion is then performed over the pre-sampling filters, and an optimal set of pre-sampling filters associated with the statistics of the input signal and the sampling frequency is found. This results in an expression for the minimal possible distortion achievable under any analog to digital conversion scheme involving uniform sampling and linear filtering. These results thus unify the Shannon-Whittaker-Kotelnikov sampling theorem and Shannon rate-distortion theory for Gaussian sources.
