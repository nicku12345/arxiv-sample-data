In phase retrieval, the goal is to recover a signal \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{C}^N from the magnitudes of linear measurements \mathbf{Ax}\in\mathbb{C}^M. While recent theory has established that M\approx 4N intensity measurements are necessary and sufficient to recover generic \mathbf{x}, there is great interest in reducing the number of measurements through the exploitation of sparse \mathbf{x}, which is known as compressive phase retrieval. In this work, we detail a novel, probabilistic approach to compressive phase retrieval based on the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. We then present a numerical study of the proposed PR-GAMP algorithm, demonstrating its excellent phase-transition behavior, robustness to noise, and runtime. Our experiments suggest that approximately M\geq 2K\log_2(N/K) intensity measurements suffice to recover K-sparse Bernoulli-Gaussian signals for \mathbf{A} with i.i.d Gaussian entries and K\ll N. Meanwhile, when recovering a 6k-sparse 65k-pixel grayscale image from 32k randomly masked and blurred Fourier intensity measurements at 30~dB measurement SNR, PR-GAMP achieved an output SNR of no less than 28~dB in all of 100 random trials, with a median runtime of only 7.3 seconds. Compared to the recently proposed CPRL, sparse-Fienup, and GESPAR algorithms, our experiments suggest that PR-GAMP has a superior phase transition and orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes as the sparsity and problem dimensions increase.
