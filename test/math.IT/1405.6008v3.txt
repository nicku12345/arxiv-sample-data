We present the first two sub-quadratic complexity decoding algorithms for one-point Hermitian codes. The first is based on a fast realisation of the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm by using state-of-the-art algorithms from computer algebra for polynomial-ring matrix minimisation. The second is a Power decoding algorithm: an extension of classical key equation decoding which gives a probabilistic decoding algorithm up to the Sudan radius. We show how the resulting key equations can be solved by the same methods from computer algebra, yielding similar asymptotic complexities.
