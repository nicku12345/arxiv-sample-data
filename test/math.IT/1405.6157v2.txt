Batch codes are a family of codes that represent a distributed storage system (DSS) of n nodes so that any batch of t data symbols can be retrieved by reading at most one symbol from each node. Fractional repetition codes are a family of codes for DSS that enable efficient uncoded repairs of failed nodes. In this work these two families of codes are combined to obtain fractional repetition batch (FRB) codes which provide both uncoded repairs and parallel reads of subsets of stored symbols. In addition, new batch codes which can tolerate node failures are considered. This new family of batch codes is called erasure combinatorial batch codes (ECBCs). Some properties of FRB codes and ECBCs and examples of their constructions based on transversal designs and affine planes are presented.
