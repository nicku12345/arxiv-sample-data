In this paper we estimate the performance of 2by3 MIMOMCCDMA system using convolution code in MATLAB which highly reduces BER by increasing the efficiency of system. MIMO and MCCDMA system combination is used to reduce bit error rate and also for forming a new system called MCCDMA which is multi user and multiple access schemes used to increase the performance of the system. MCCDMA system is a narrowband flat fading in nature which converts frequency selective to numerous narrowband flat fading multiple parallel sub-carriers to increase the efficiency of the system. Now this MCCDMA system can also be enhanced by grouping with 2by3 MIMO system which utilizes ZF decoder at the receiver to decrease BER in which half rate convolutionally encoded Alamouti STBC block code is used for channel encoding scheme as transmit diversity of MIMO with multiple transmit antenna. And convolution encoder is also used as source encoder or FEC encoder in MIMOMCCDMA. Advantage of using MIMO-MC-CDMA using convolution code is due to reduce complexity of system and also for reducing BER and finally to increase gain of system. Now after this we examine system in various modulation techniques like, 8PSK, 16QAM, QPSK, 32QAM, 8QAM and 64QAM using MATLAB in Rayleigh fading channel.
