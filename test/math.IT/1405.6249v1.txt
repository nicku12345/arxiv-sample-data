In this paper, we focus on the two-user Gaussian interference channel (GIC), and study the Han-Kobayashi (HK) coding/decoding strategy with the objective of designing low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. A code optimization algorithm is proposed which adopts a random perturbation technique via tracking the average mutual information. The degree distribution optimization and convergence threshold computation are carried out for strong and weak interference channels, employing binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). Under strong interference, it is observed that optimized codes operate close to the capacity boundary. For the case of weak interference, it is shown that via the newly designed codes, a nontrivial rate pair is achievable, which is not attainable by single user codes with time-sharing. Performance of the designed LDPC codes are also studied for finite block lengths through simulations of specific codes picked from the optimized degree distributions.
