We propose a new Write-Once-Memory (WOM) coding scheme based on source polarization. By applying a source polarization transformation on the to-be-determined codeword, the proposed WOM coding scheme encodes information into the bits in the high-entropy set. We prove in this paper that the proposed WOM codes are capacity-achieving. WOM codes have found many applications in modern data storage systems, such as flash memories.
