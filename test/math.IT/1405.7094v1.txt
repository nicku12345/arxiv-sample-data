Consistent reconstruction is a method for producing an estimate \widetilde{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d of a signal x\in \mathbb{R}^d if one is given a collection of N noisy linear measurements q_n = \langle x, \varphi_n \rangle + \epsilon_n, 1 \leq n \leq N, that have been corrupted by i.i.d. uniform noise \{\epsilon_n\}_{n=1}^N. We prove mean squared error bounds for consistent reconstruction when the measurement vectors \{\varphi_n\}_{n=1}^N\subset \mathbb{R}^d are drawn independently at random from a suitable distribution on the unit-sphere \mathbb{S}^{d-1}. Our main results prove that the mean squared error (MSE) for consistent reconstruction is of the optimal order \mathbb{E}\|x - \widetilde{x}\|^2 \leq K\delta^2/N^2 under general conditions on the measurement vectors. We also prove refined MSE bounds when the measurement vectors are i.i.d. uniformly distributed on the unit-sphere \mathbb{S}^{d-1} and, in particular, show that in this case the constant K is dominated by d^3, the cube of the ambient dimension. The proofs involve an analysis of random polytopes using coverage processes on the sphere.
