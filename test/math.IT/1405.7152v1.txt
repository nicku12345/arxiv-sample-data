We show how Gabidulin codes can be list decoded by using an iterative parametrization approach. For a given received word, our decoding algorithm processes its entries one by one, constructing four polynomials at each step. This then yields a parametrization of interpolating solutions for the data so far. From the final result a list of all codewords that are closest to the received word with respect to the rank metric is obtained.
