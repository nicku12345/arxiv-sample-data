The compound broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCC) generalizes the BCC by modeling the uncertainty of the channel. For the compound BCC, it is only known that the actual channel realization belongs to a pre-specified uncertainty set of channels and that it is constant during the whole transmission. For reliable and secure communication is necessary to operate at a rate pair within the compound BCC capacity region. Therefore, the question whether small variations of the uncertainty set lead to large losses of the compound BCC capacity region is studied. It is shown that the compound BCC model is robust, i.e., the capacity region depends continuously on the uncertainty set.
