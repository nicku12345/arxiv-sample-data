A lossy source code \mathcal{C} with rate R for a discrete memoryless source S is called subset-universal if for every 0<R'< R, almost every subset of 2^{nR'} of its codewords achieves average distortion close to the source's distortion-rate function D(R'). In this paper we prove the asymptotic existence of such codes. Moreover, we show the asymptotic existence of a code that is subset-universal with respect to all sources with the same alphabet.
