Simultaneous estimation of range and angle of close emitters usually requires a multidimensional search. This paper offers an algorithm to improve the position of an element of any array designed on the basis of some certain or random rules. In the proposed method one element moves on its original direction, i.e., keeping the vertical distance to each source, to reach the constellation with less CRB. The performance of this method has been demonstrated through simulation and a comparison of the CRB with receptive signals covariance matrix determinant has been made before and after the use of this method.
