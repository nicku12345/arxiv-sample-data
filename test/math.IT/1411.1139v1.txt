In this work we explore possibilities for coding and decoding tailor-made for mean squared error evaluation of error in contexts such as image transmission. To do so, we introduce a loss function that expresses the overall performance of a coding and decoding scheme for discrete channels and that exchanges the usual goal of minimizing the error probability to that of minimizing the expected loss. In this environment we explore the possibilities of using ordered decoders to create a message-wise unequal error protection (UEP), where the most valuable information is protected by placing in its proximity information words that differ by a small valued error. We give explicit examples, using scale-of-gray images, including small-scale performance analysis and visual simulations for the BSMC.
