Power models are needed to assess the power consumption of cellular Base Station (BS) on an abstract level. Currently available models are either too simplified to cover necessary aspects or overly complex. We provide a parameterized linear power model which covers the individual aspects of a BS which are relevant for a power consumption analysis, especially the transmission bandwidth and the number of radio chains. Details reflecting the underlying architecture are abstracted in favor of simplicity and applicability. We identify current power-saving techniques of cellular networks for which this model can be used. Furthermore, the parameter set of typical commercial BS is provided and compared to the underlying complex model. The complex model is well approximated while only using a fraction of the input parameters.
