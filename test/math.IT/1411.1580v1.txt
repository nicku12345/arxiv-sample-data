While the impact of finite-rate feedback on the capacity of fading channels has been extensively studied in the literature, not much attention has been paid to this problem under secrecy constraint. In this work, we study the ergodic secret capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna-eavesdropper (MIMOME) wiretap channel with quantized channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and perfect CSI at the legitimate receiver, under the assumption that only the statistics of eavesdropper CSI is known at the transmitter. We refine the analysis of the random vector quantization (RVQ) based artificial noise (AN) scheme in [1], where a heuristic upper bound on the secrecy rate loss, when compared to the perfect CSI case, was given. We propose a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity. We show that the lower bound and the secrecy capacity with perfect CSI coincide asymptotically as the number of feedback bits and the AN power go to infinity. For practical applications, we propose a very efficient quantization codebook construction method for the two transmit antennas case.
