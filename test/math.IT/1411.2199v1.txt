In low-intermediate-frequency (low-IF) receivers, I/Q imbalance (IQI) causes interference on the desired signal from the blocker signal transmitted over the image frequencies. Conventional approaches for data-aided IQI estimation in zero-IF receivers are not applicable to low-IF receivers. In zero-IF receivers, IQI induces self-interference where the pilots of the image interference are completely identified. However, in low IF receivers, the image interference originates from a foreign signal whose training sequence timing and structure are neither known nor synchronized with the desired signal. We develop a data-aided subspace method for the estimation of IQI parameters in low-IF receivers in the presence of unknown fading channel. Our approach does not require the knowledge of the interference statistics, channel model nor noise statistics. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other blind IQI compensation approaches.
