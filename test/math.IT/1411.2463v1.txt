In this paper, we propose a polar coding scheme for secure communication over the multiple-input, single-output, single-antenna eavesdropper (MISOSE) fading channel. We consider the case of block fading channels with known eavesdropper channel state information (CSI) and the case of fading channels with known eavesdropper channel distribution information (CDI). We use the artificial noise assisted secure precoding method to maximize the secrecy capacity in the first case, and to overcome the unawareness of the eavesdropper CSI in the second case. We show that our proposed scheme can provide both reliable and secure communication over the MISOSE channel with low encoding and decoding complexity.
