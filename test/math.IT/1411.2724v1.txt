The simultaneous wireless transfer of information and power with the help of a relay equipped with multiple antennas is considered in this letter, where a harvest-and-forward strategy is proposed. In particular, the relay harvests energy and obtains information from the source with the radio-frequent signals by jointly using the antenna selection (AS) and power splitting (PS) techniques, and then the processed information is amplified and forwarded to the destination relying on the harvested energy. This letter jointly optimizes AS and PS to maximize the achievable rate for the proposed strategy. Considering the joint optimization is according to the non-convex problem, a two-stage procedure is proposed to determine the optimal ratio of received signal power split for energy harvesting, and the optimized antenna set engaged in information forwarding. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the two-stage procedure, and demonstrate that the proposed harvest-and-forward strategy outperforms the conventional amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying and the direct transmission.
