We assume a full-duplex (FD) cooperative network subject to hostile attacks and undergoing composite fading channels. We focus on two scenarios: \textit{a)} the transmitter has full CSI, for which we derive closed-form expressions for the \textit{average secrecy rate}; and \textit{b)} the transmitter only knows the CSI of the legitimate nodes, for which we obtain closed-form expressions for the \textit{secrecy outage probability}. We show that secure FD relaying is feasible, even under strong self-interference and in the presence of sophisticated multiple antenna eavesdropper.
