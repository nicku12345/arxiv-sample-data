In this paper we consider the generalization of binary spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes to finite fields GF(q), q\geq 2, and develop design rules for q-ary SC-LDPC code ensembles based on their iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding thresholds, with particular emphasis on low-latency windowed decoding (WD). We consider transmission over both the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGNC) and present results for a variety of (J,K)-regular SC-LDPC code ensembles constructed over GF(q) using protographs. Thresholds are calculated using protograph versions of q-ary density evolution (for the BEC) and q-ary extrinsic information transfer analysis (for the BIAWGNC). We show that WD of q-ary SC-LDPC codes provides significant threshold gains compared to corresponding (uncoupled) q-ary LDPC block code (LDPC-BC) ensembles when the window size W is large enough and that these gains increase as the finite field size q=2^m increases. Moreover, we demonstrate that the new design rules provide WD thresholds that are close to capacity, even when both m and W are relatively small (thereby reducing decoding complexity and latency). The analysis further shows that, compared to standard flooding-schedule decoding, WD of q-ary SC-LDPC code ensembles results in significant reductions in both decoding complexity and decoding latency, and that these reductions increase as m increases. For applications with a near-threshold performance requirement and a constraint on decoding latency, we show that using q-ary SC-LDPC code ensembles, with moderate q>2, instead of their binary counterparts results in reduced decoding complexity.
