In this paper we study the identification of a time-varying linear system from its response to a known input signal. More specifically, we consider systems whose response to the input signal is given by a weighted superposition of delayed and Doppler shifted versions of the input. This problem arises in a multitude of applications such as wireless communications and radar imaging. Due to practical constraints, the input signal has finite bandwidth B, and the received signal is observed over a finite time interval of length T only. This gives rise to a delay and Doppler resolution of 1/B and 1/T. We show that this resolution limit can be overcome, i.e., we can exactly recover the continuous delay-Doppler pairs and the corresponding attenuation factors, by solving a convex optimization problem. This result holds provided that the distance between the delay-Doppler pairs is at least 2.37/B in time or 2.37/T in frequency. Furthermore, this result allows the total number of delay-Doppler pairs to be linear up to a log-factor in BT, the dimensionality of the response of the system, and thereby the limit for identifiability. Stated differently, we show that we can estimate the time-frequency components of a signal that is S-sparse in the continuous dictionary of time-frequency shifts of a random window function, from a number of measurements, that is linear up to a log-factor in S.
