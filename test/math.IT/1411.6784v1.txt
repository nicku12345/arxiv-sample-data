Let {\cal C} be a q-ary code of length n and size M, and {\cal C}(i) = \{{\bf c}(i) \ | \ {\bf c}=({\bf c}(1), {\bf c}(2), \ldots, {\bf c}(n))^{T} \in {\cal C}\} be the set of ith coordinates of {\cal C}. The descendant code of a sub-code {\cal C}^{'} \subseteq {\cal C} is defined to be {\cal C}^{'}(1) \times {\cal C}^{'}(2) \times \cdots \times {\cal C}^{'}(n). In this paper, we introduce a multimedia analogue of codes with the identifiable parent property (IPP), called multimedia IPP codes or t-MIPPC(n, M, q), so that given the descendant code of any sub-code {\cal C}^{'} of a multimedia t-IPP code {\cal C}, one can always identify, as IPP codes do in the generic digital scenario, at least one codeword in {\cal C}^{'}. We first derive a general upper bound on the size M of a multimedia t-IPP code, and then investigate multimedia 3-IPP codes in more detail. We characterize a multimedia 3-IPP code of length 2 in terms of a bipartite graph and a generalized packing, respectively. By means of these combinatorial characterizations, we further derive a tight upper bound on the size of a multimedia 3-IPP code of length 2, and construct several infinite families of (asymptotically) optimal multimedia 3-IPP codes of length 2.
