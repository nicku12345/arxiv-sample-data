Binary multimedia identifiable parent property codes (binary t-MIPPCs) are used in multimedia fingerprinting schemes where the identification of users taking part in the averaging collusion attack to illegally redistribute content is required. In this paper, we first introduce a binary strong multimedia identifiable parent property code (binary t-SMIPPC) whose tracing algorithm is more efficient than that of a binary t-MIPPC. Then a composition construction for binary t-SMIPPCs from q-ary t-SMIPPCs is provided. Several infinite series of optimal q-ary t-SMIPPCs of length 2 with t = 2, 3 are derived from the relationships among t-SMIPPCs and other fingerprinting codes, such as \overline{t}-separable codes and t-MIPPCs. Finally, combinatorial properties of q-ary 2-SMIPPCs of length 3 are investigated, and optimal q-ary 2-SMIPPCs of length 3 with q \equiv 0, 1, 2, 5 \pmod 6 are constructed.
