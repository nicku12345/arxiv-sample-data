Sparse signals can be recovered from a reduced set of samples by using compressive sensing algorithms. In common methods the signal is recovered in the sparse domain. A method for the reconstruction of sparse signal which reconstructs the remaining missing samples/measurements is recently proposed. The available samples are fixed, while the missing samples are considered as minimization variables. Recovery of missing samples/measurements is done using an adaptive gradient-based algorithm in the time domain. A new criterion for the parameter adaptation in this algorithm, based on the gradient direction angles, is proposed. It improves the algorithm computational efficiency. A theorem for the uniqueness of the recovered signal for given set of missing samples (reconstruction variables) is presented. The case when available samples are a random subset of a uniformly or nonuniformly sampled signal is considered in this paper. A recalculation procedure is used to reconstruct the nonuniformly sampled signal. The methods are illustrated on statistical examples.
