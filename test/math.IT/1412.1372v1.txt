In this paper, the effects of oscillator phase-noise with arbitrary spectral characteristics on self-interference cancellation capability of a full-duplex radio transceiver are addressed, and design considerations are given for oscillator designers for optimized PLL design for full-duplex radio application. The paper first gives a full-duplex transceiver model that inherently mitigates most of the phase-noise effect from the self-interference signal. The remaining effect of the phase noise is then analysed. Closed-form solutions for the self-interference power are then derived. In the simulations part, a practical phase-locked loop type oscillator is used, which is based on the arbitrary mask phase-noise model. Analytical derivations are verified with the simulations, and the self-interference cancellation performance is thoroughly studied with various parameters. Design considerations are finally given for oscillator design for full-duplex radio transceivers, with the help of tangible parameters of the phase-locked loop type oscillators.
