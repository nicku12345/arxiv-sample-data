Let B be an unknown linear evolution process on \mathbb C^d\simeq l^2(\mathbb Z_d) driving an unknown initial state x and producing the states \{B^\ell x, \ell = 0,1,\ldots\} at different time levels. The problem under consideration in this paper is to find as much information as possible about B and x from the measurements Y=\{x(i), Bx(i), \dots, B^{\ell_i}x(i): i \in \Omega\subset \mathbb Z^d\}. If B is a "low-pass" convolution operator, we show that we can recover both B and x, almost surely, as long as we double the amount of temporal samples needed in \cite{ADK13} to recover the signal propagated by a known operator B. For a general operator B, we can recover parts or even all of its spectrum from Y. As a special case of our method, we derive the centuries old Prony's method \cite{BDVMC08, P795, PP13} which recovers a vector with an s-sparse Fourier transform from 2s of its consecutive components.
