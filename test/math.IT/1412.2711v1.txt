In a K-user Gaussian interference channel, it has been shown by Geng et al. that if for each user the desired signal strength is no less than the sum of the strengths of the strongest interference from this user and the strongest interference to this user (all values in dB scale), then power control and treating interference as noise (TIN) is optimal from the perspective of generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) and achieves the entire channel capacity region to within a constant gap. In this work, we generalize the optimality of TIN to compound networks. We show that for a K-user compound Gaussian interference channel, if in every possible state for each receiver, the channel always satisfies the TIN-optimality condition identified by Geng et al., then the GDoF region of the compound channel is the intersection of the GDoF regions of all possible network realizations, which is achievable by power control and TIN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a general K-user compound interference channel, regardless of the number of states of each receiver, we can always construct a counterpart K-user regular interference channel that has the same TIN region as the original compound channel. The regular interference channel has only one state for each receiver, which may be different from all of the original states. Solving the GDoF-based power control problem for the compound channel is equivalent to solving the same problem in its regular counterpart. Exploring the power control problem further we develop a centralized power control scheme for K-user compound interference channels, to achieve all the Pareto optimal GDoF tuples. Finally, based on this scheme, we devise an iterative power control algorithm which requires at most K updates to obtain the globally optimal power allocation for any feasible GDoF tuple.
