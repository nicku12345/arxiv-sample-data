This paper considers the problem of recovering the delays and amplitudes of a weighted superposition of pulses. This problem is motivated by a variety of applications such as ultrasound and radar. We show that for univariate and bivariate stream of pulses, one can recover the delays and weights to any desired accuracy by solving a tractable convex optimization problem, provided that a pulse-dependent separation condition is satisfied. The main result of this paper states that the recovery is robust to additive noise or model mismatch.
