In the current paper we consider the Helical Cone Beam CT. This scanning method exposes the patient to large quantities of radiation and results in very large amounts of data being collected and stored. Both these facts are prime motivators for the development of an efficient, reduced rate, sampling pattern. We calculate bounds on the support in the frequency domain of the collected data and use these to suggest an efficient sampling pattern. A reduction of up to a factor of 2 in sampling rate is suggested. Indeed, we show that reconstruction quality is not affected by this reduction of sampling rates.
