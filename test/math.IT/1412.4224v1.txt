We consider channel/subspace tracking systems for temporally correlated millimeter wave (e.g., E-band) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Our focus is given to the tracking algorithm in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environment, where the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with hybrid analog/digital precoder and combiner, respectively. In the absence of straightforward time-correlated channel model in the millimeter wave MIMO literature, we present a temporal MIMO channel evolution model for NLoS millimeter wave scenarios. Considering that conventional MIMO channel tracking algorithms in microwave bands are not directly applicable, we propose a new channel tracking technique based on sequentially updating the precoder and combiner. Numerical results demonstrate the superior channel tracking ability of the proposed technique over independent sounding approach in the presented channel model and the spatial channel model (SCM) adopted in 3GPP specification.
