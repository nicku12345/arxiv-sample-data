The Arimoto algorithm computes the Gallager function \max_Q {E}_{0}^{}(\rho,Q) for a given channel {P}_{}^{}(y \,|\, x) and parameter \rho, by means of alternating maximization. Along the way, it generates a sequence of input distributions {Q}_{1}^{}(x), {Q}_{2}^{}(x), ... , that converges to the maximizing input {Q}_{}^{*}(x). We propose a stochastic interpretation for the Arimoto algorithm. We show that for a random (i.i.d.) codebook with a distribution {Q}_{k}^{}(x), the next distribution {Q}_{k+1}^{}(x) in the Arimoto algorithm is equal to the type ({Q}') of the feasible transmitted codeword that maximizes the conditional Gallager exponent (conditioned on a specific transmitted codeword type {Q}'). This interpretation is a first step toward finding a stochastic mechanism for on-line channel input adaptation.
