This study proposes a novel precoding scheme for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). The base station (BS) and the MIMO relay station (RS) are both equipped with the same codebook of unitary matrices. According to each element of the codebook, we create a latent precoding matrix pair, namely a BS precoding matrix and an RS precoding matrix. The RS precoding matrix is formed by multiplying the appropriate unitary matrix from the codebook by a power scaling factor. Based on the given CSI and a block of transmit symbols, the optimum precoding matrix pair, within the class of all possible latent precoding matrix pairs derived from the various unitary matrices, is selected by a suitable selection mechanism for transmission, which is designed to minimize the squared Euclidean distance between the pre-estimated received vector and the true transmit symbol vector. We develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE) design algorithm for the construction of the latent precoding matrix pairs. In the proposed scheme, rather than sending the complete processing matrix, only the index of the unitary matrix and its power scaling factor are sent by the BS to the RS. This significantly reduces the overhead. Simulation results show that compared to other recently reported precoding algorithms the proposed precoding scheme is capable of providing improved robustness against the effects of CSI estimation errors and multiuser interference.
