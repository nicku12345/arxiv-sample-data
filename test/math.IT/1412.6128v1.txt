Binary t-frameproof codes (t-FPCs) are used in multimedia fingerprinting schemes where the identification of authorized users taking part in the averaging collusion attack is required. In this paper, a binary strongly \bar{t}-separable code (\bar{t}-SSC) is introduced to improve such a scheme based on a binary t-FPC. A binary \bar{t}-SSC has the same traceability as a binary t-FPC but has more codewords than a binary t-FPC. A composition construction for binary \bar{t}-SSCs from q-ary \bar{t}-SSCs is described, which stimulates the research on q-ary \bar{t}-SSCs with short length. Several infinite series of optimal q-ary \bar{2}-SSCs of length 2 are derived from the fact that a q-ary \bar{2}-SSC of length 2 is equivalent to a q-ary \bar{2}-separable code of length 2. Combinatorial properties of q-ary \bar{2}-SSCs of length 3 are investigated, and a construction for q-ary \bar{2}-SSCs of length 3 is provided. These \bar{2}-SSCs of length 3 have more than 12.5\% codewords than 2-FPCs of length 3 could have.
