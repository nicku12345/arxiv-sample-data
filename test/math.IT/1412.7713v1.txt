This work investigates the joint design of fronthaul compression and precoding for the downlink of Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RANs). In a C-RAN, a central unit (CU) performs the baseband processing for a cluster of radio units (RUs) that receive compressed baseband samples from the CU through low-latency fronthaul links. Most previous works on the design of fronthaul compression and precoding assume constant channels and instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the CU. This work, in contrast, concentrates on a more practical scenario with block-ergodic channels and considers either instantaneous or stochastic CSI at the CU. Moreover, the analysis encompasses both the Compression-After-Precoding (CAP) and the Compression-Before-Precoding (CBP) schemes. With the CAP approach, which is the standard C-RAN solution, the CU performs channel coding and precoding and then the CU compresses and forwards the resulting baseband signals on the fronthaul links to the RUs. With the CBP scheme, instead, the CU does not perform precoding but rather forwards separately the information messages of a subset of mobile stations (MSs) along with the compressed precoding matrices to the each RU, which then performs precoding. Optimization algorithms over fronthaul compression and precoding for both CAP and CBP are proposed that are based on a stochastic successive upper-bound minimization approach. Via numerical results, the relative merits of the two strategies under either instantaneous or stochastic CSI are evaluated as a function of system parameters such as fronthaul capacity and channel coherence time.
