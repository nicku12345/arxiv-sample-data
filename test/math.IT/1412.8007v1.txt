This paper highlights security issues that can arise when incorrect assumptions are made on the capabilities of an eavesdropper. In particular, we analyze a channel model based on a split Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Corresponding security parameters are chosen based on this channel model, and assumptions on the eavesdroppers capabilities. A gradual relaxation of the restrictions on the eavesdropper's capabilities will be made, and the resulting loss of security will be quantified. An alternative will then be presented that is based on stochastic encoding and creating artificially noisy channels through the usage of private keys. The artificial channel will be constructed through a deterministic process that will be computationally intractable to reverse.
