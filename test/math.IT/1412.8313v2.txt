This paper investigates the system achievable rate and optimization for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with an energy harvesting (EH) relay. Firstly we propose a time switchingbased relaying (TSR) protocol to enable the simultaneous information processing and energy harvesting at the relay. Then, we discuss its achievable rate performance theoretically and formulated an optimization problem to maximize the system achievable rate. As the problem is difficult to solve, we design an Augmented Lagrangian Penalty Function (ALPF) method for it. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical results and the effectiveness of the ALPF method.
