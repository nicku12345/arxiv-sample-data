This paper first present a new general completely perturbed compressed sensing (CS) model y=(A+E)(x+u)+e,called \emph{noise folding based on general completely perturbed CS system},~where y\in R^m,~u \in R^m,~u\neq 0,~e\in R^m, A\in R^{m\times n},~m\ll n,~E\in R^{m\times n} with incorporating general nonzero perturbation E to sensing matrix A and noise u into signal x simultaneously based on the standard CS model y=Ax+e.~Our constructions mainly will whiten the new proposed CS model and explore into RIP,~coherence for A+E of the new CS model after being whitened.
