The binary adder is a two-user multiple access channel whose inputs are binary and whose output is the real sum of the inputs. While the Shannon capacity region of this channel is well known, little is known regarding its zero-error capacity region, and a large gap remains between the best inner and outer bounds. In this paper, we provide an improved outer bound for this problem. To that end, we introduce a soft variation of the Saur-Perles-Shelah Lemma, that is then used in conjunction with an outer bound for the Shannon capacity region with an additional common message.
