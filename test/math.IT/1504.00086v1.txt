The restricted isometry property (RIP) has become well-known in the compressed sensing community. Recently, a weaken version of RIP was proposed for exact sparse recovery under weak moment assumptions. In this note, we prove that the weaken RIP is also sufficient for \textsl{stable and robust} sparse recovery by linking it with a recently introduced robust width property in compressed sensing. Moreover, we show that it can be widely apply to other compressed sensing instances as well.
