In this paper we study the quantization stage that is implicit in any compressed sensing signal acquisition paradigm. We propose using Sigma-Delta quantization and a subsequent reconstruction scheme based on convex optimization. We prove that the reconstruction error due to quantization decays polynomially in the number of measurements. Our results apply to arbitrary signals, including compressible ones, and account for measurement noise. Additionally, they hold for sub-Gaussian (including Gaussian and Bernoulli) random compressed sensing measurements, as well as for both high bit-depth and coarse quantizers, and they extend to 1-bit quantization. In the noise-free case, when the signal is strictly sparse we prove that by optimizing the order of the quantization scheme one can obtain root-exponential decay in the reconstruction error due to quantization.
