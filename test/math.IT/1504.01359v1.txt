We consider ten linear rank inequalities, which always hold for ranks of vector subspaces, and look at them as group inequalities. We prove that groups of order pq, for p,q two distinct primes, always satisfy these ten group inequalities. We give partial results for groups of order p^2q, and find that the symmetric group S_4 is the smallest group that yield violations, for two among the ten group inequalities.
