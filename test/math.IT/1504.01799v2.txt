In this paper we introduce a nonextensive quantum information theoretic measure which may be defined between any arbitrary number of density matrices, and we analyze its fundamental properties in the spectral graph-theoretic framework. Unlike other entropic measures, the proposed quantum divergence is symmetric, matrix-convex, theoretically upper-bounded, and has the advantage of being generalizable to any arbitrary number of density matrices, with a possibility of assigning weights to these densities.
