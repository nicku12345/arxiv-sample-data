Energy Efficiency (EE) is a big issue in 5th Generation Wireless Communications (5G) on condition that the number of access User Equipments (UEs) are exploding and more antennas should be equipped in one Base Station (BS). In EE studies, prior literatures focus on the energy consumption of single separated BS coverage area or through scheduling mechanism or network coding method. But some other elements are ignored in those literatures, such as the energy consumption of machine room, circuit, etc. In this paper, to be more closer to the reality, based on the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), we modify its traditional structure for easier layout of sleeping mechanism in the real world, study the EE issue within a comprehensive view while taking more elements into consideration. We modified the traditional C-RAN structure with the purpose of much easily adopting the sleeping mechanism with on-off selection method. Afterwards, the EE issue is modeled into a mathematical optimizing problem and its solution is given by a tractable method. The analysis of sum capacity in one cluster of this modified structure is addressed first. Then based on the analysis, the EE issue is studied with a comprehensive view while taking more elements into consideration. In the next step, we convert it into an optimization problem and give its solution with the sleeping techniques. Comparing with prior works, this proposal is of better performance for the merit of comprehensive vision and easier layout characteristic.
