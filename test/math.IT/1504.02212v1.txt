Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has been proposed to enhance the Spectrum Efficiency (SE) and cell-edge capacity. This paper considers the massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) encoding. The close-form expression of capacity of the massive MIMO with NOMA is given here. Apart from the previous Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) method, the Power Hard Limiter (PHD) is introduced here for better reality implement.
