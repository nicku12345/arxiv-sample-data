The paper suggests a method of optimal extension of one-sided semi-infinite sequences of a general type by traces of band-limited sequences in deterministic setting, i.e. without probabilistic assumptions. The method requires to solve a closed linear equation in the time domain connecting the past observations of the underlying process with the future values of the band-limited process.   Robustness of the solution with respect to the input errors and data truncation is established in the framework of Tikhonov regularization.
