In this paper, the problem of optimal maximum likelihood detection in a single user single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel with phase noise at the receiver is considered. The optimal detection rules under training are derived for two operation modes, namely when the phase increments are fully correlated among the M receiver antennas (synchronous operation) and when they are independent (non-synchronous operation). The phase noise increments are parameterized by a very general distribution, which includes the Wiener phase noise model as a special case. It is proven that phase noise creates a symbol-error-rate (SER) floor for both operation modes. In the synchronous operation this error floor is independent of M, while it goes to zero exponentially with M in the non-synchronous operation.
