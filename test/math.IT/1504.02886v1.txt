Two major relay-selection strategies widely applied in cooperative decode-and-forward (DF) relaying networks, namely, reactive relay selection (RRS) and proactive relay selection (PRS), are generally looked upon as independent and studied separately. In this paper, RRS and PRS are proven to be equivalent with respect to the end-to-end outage probability from the first principle, i.e. their respective relay-selection criteria. On the other hand, RRS is shown to be superior to PRS with respect to the end-to-end symbol error rate. Afterwards, a case study of a general DF relaying system, subject to co-channel interferences and additive white Gaussian noise at both the relaying nodes and the destination, is performed to explicitly illustrate the aforementioned outage equivalence. These fundamental relations provide intuitive yet insightful performance benchmarks for comparing various applications of these two relay-selection strategies.
