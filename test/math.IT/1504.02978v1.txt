In this paper, we consider the asymptotic and finite-length performance of block Markov superposition transmission~(BMST) of short codes, which can be viewed as a new class of spatially coupled~(SC) codes with the generator matrices of short codes~(referred to as {\em basic codes}) coupled. A modified extrinsic information transfer~(EXIT) chart analysis that takes into account the relation between mutual information~(MI) and bit-error-rate~(BER) is presented to study the convergence behavior of BMST codes. Using the modified EXIT chart analysis, we investigate the impact of various parameters on BMST code performance, thereby providing theoretical guidance for designing and implementing practical BMST codes suitable for sliding window decoding. Then, we present a performance comparison of BMST codes and SC low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes on the basis of equal decoding latency. Also presented is a comparison of computational complexity. Simulation results show that, under the equal decoding latency constraint, BMST codes using the repetition code as the basic code can outperform (3,6)-regular SC-LDPC codes in the waterfall region but have a higher computational complexity.
