Unicast communication over a network of M-parallel relays in the presence of an eavesdropper is considered. The relay nodes, operating under individual power constraints, amplify and forward the signals received at their inputs. The problem of the maximum secrecy rate achievable with AF relaying is addressed. Previous work on this problem provides iterative algorithms based on semidefinite relaxation. However, those algorithms result in suboptimal performance without any performance and convergence guarantees. We address this problem for three specific network models, with real-valued channel gains. We propose a novel transformation that leads to convex optimization problems. Our analysis leads to (i)a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the optimal secure AF rate for two of the models and (ii) a closed-form expression for the optimal secure rate for the other.
