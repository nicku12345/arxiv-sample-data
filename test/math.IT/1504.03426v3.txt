This paper presents the first network-coded multiple access (NCMA) system prototype operated on high-order modulations up to 16-QAM. NCMA jointly exploits physical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost throughput of multipacket reception systems. Direct generalization of the existing NCMA decoding algorithm, originally designed for BPSK, to high-order modulations, will lead to huge performance degradation. The throughput degradation is caused by the relative phase offset between received signals from different nodes. To circumvent the phase offset problem, this paper investigates an NCMA system with multiple receive antennas at the access point (AP), referred to as MIMO-NCMA. We put forth a low-complexity symbol-level NCMA decoder that, together with MIMO, can substantially alleviate the performance degradation induced by relative phase offset. To demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of MIMO-NCMA for high-order modulations, we implemented our designs on software-defined radio. Our experimental results show that the throughput of QPSK MIMO-NCMA is double that of both BPSK NCMA and QPSK MUD at SNR=10dB. For higher SNRs at which 16-QAM can be supported, the throughput of MIMO-NCMA can be as high as 3.5 times that of BPSK NCMA. Overall, this paper provides an implementable framework for high-order modulated NCMA.
