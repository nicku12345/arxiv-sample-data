Gallager and Van Voorhis have found optimal prefix-free codes \kappa(K) for a random variable K that is geometrically distributed: \Pr[K=k] = p(1-p)^k for k\ge 0. We determine the asymptotic behavior of the expected length {\rm Ex}[{\#\kappa(K)}] of these codes as p\to 0: {\rm Ex}[{\#\kappa(K)}] = \log_2 {1\over p} + \log_2 \log 2 + 2 + f\left(\log_2 {1\over p} + \log_2 \log 2\right) + O(p), where f(z) = 4\cdot 2^{-2^{1-\{z\}}} - \{z\} - 1, and \{z\} = z - \lfloor z\rfloor is the fractional part of z. The function f(z) is a periodic function (with period 1) that exhibits small oscillations (with magnitude less than 0.005) about an even smaller average value (less than 0.0005).
