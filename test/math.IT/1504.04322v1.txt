In this paper, we consider the bacterial point-to-point communication problem with one transmitter and one receiver by considering the ligand receptor binding process. The most commonly investigated signalling model, referred to as the Level Scenario (LS), uses one type of a molecule with different concentration levels for signaling. An alternative approach is to employ multiple types of molecules with a single concentration level, referred to as the Type Scenario (TS). We investigate the trade-offs between the two scenarios for the ligand receptor from the capacity point of view. For this purpose, we evaluate the capacity using numerical algorithms. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the capacity of the ligand receptor using a Binomial Channel (BIC) model using symmetrized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. A lower bound is also derived when the environment noise is negligible. Finally, we analyse the effect of blocking of a receptor by a molecule of a different type, by proposing a new Markov model in the multiple-type signalling.
