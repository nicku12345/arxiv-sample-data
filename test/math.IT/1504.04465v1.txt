We propose a probabilistic handshake mechanism for all-to-all broadcast coded slotted ALOHA. We consider a fully connected network where each user acts as both transmitter and receiver in a half-duplex mode. Users attempt to exchange messages with each other and to establish one-to-one handshakes, in the sense that each user decides whether its packet was successfully received by the other users: After performing decoding, each user estimates in which slots the resolved users transmitted their packets and, based on that, decides if these users successfully received its packet. The simulation results show that the proposed handshake algorithm allows the users to reliably perform the handshake. The paper also provides some analytical bounds on the performance of the proposed algorithm which are in good agreement with the simulation results.
