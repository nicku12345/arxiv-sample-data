Network switches and routers need to serve packet writes and reads at rates that challenge the most advanced memory technologies. As a result, scaling the switching rates is commonly done by parallelizing the packet I/Os using multiple memory units. For improved read rates, packets can be coded with an [n,k] MDS code, thus giving more flexibility at read time to achieve higher utilization of the memory units. In the paper, we study the usage of [n,k] MDS codes in a switching environment. In particular, we study the algorithmic problem of maximizing the instantaneous read rate given a set of packet requests and the current layout of the coded packets in memory. The most interesting results from practical standpoint show how the complexity of reaching optimal read rate depends strongly on the writing policy of the coded packets.
