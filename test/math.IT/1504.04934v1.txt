In this paper, we study the symmetry of polar codes on symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels (B-DMC). The symmetry property of polar codes is originally pointed out in Arikan's work for general B-DMC channels. With the symmetry, the output vector y_1^N (N be the block length) can be divided into equivalence classes in terms of their transition probabilities. In this paper, we present a new frame of analysis on the symmetry of polar codes for B-DMC channels. Theorems are provided to characterize the symmetries among the received vectors.
