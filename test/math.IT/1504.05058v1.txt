Fast-decodable distributed space-time codes are constructed by adapting the iterative code construction introduced in [1] to the N -relay multiple-input multiple-output channel, leading to the first fast-decodable distributed space-time codes for more than one antenna per user. Explicit constructions are provided alongside with a performance comparison to non-iterated (non-) fast-decodable codes.
