We introduce a "one shot" random access procedure where users can send a message without a priori synchronizing with the network. In this procedure a common overloaded control channel is used to jointly detect sparse user activity and sparse channel profiles. The detected information is subsequently used to demodulate the data in dedicated frequency slots. We analyze the system theoretically and provide a link between achievable rates and standard compressing sensing estimates in terms of explicit expressions and scaling laws. Finally, we support our findings with simulations in an LTE-A-like setting allowing "one shot" sparse random access of 100 users in 1ms.
