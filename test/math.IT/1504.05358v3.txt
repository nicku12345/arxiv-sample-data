A strong motivation of charging depleted battery can be an enabler for network capacity increase. In this light we propose a spatial attraction cellular network (SAN) consisting of macro cells overlaid with small cell base stations that wirelessly charge user batteries. Such a network makes battery depleting users move toward the vicinity of small cell base stations. With a fine adjustment of charging power, this user spatial attraction (SA) improves in spectral efficiency as well as load balancing. We jointly optimize both enhancements thanks to SA, and derive the corresponding optimal charging power in a closed form by using a stochastic geometric approach.
