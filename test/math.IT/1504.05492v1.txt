In this note, we present an information diffusion inequality derived from an elementary argument, which gives rise to a very general Fano-type inequality. The latter unifies and generalizes the distance-based Fano inequality and the continuous Fano inequality established in [Corollary 1, Propositions 1 and 2, arXiv:1311.2669v2], as well as the generalized Fano inequality in [Equation following (10); T. S. Han and S. Verd\'u. Generalizing the Fano inequality. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 40(4):1247-1251, July 1994].
