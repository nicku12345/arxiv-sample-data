Low-complexity carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation and compensation in multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a challenging problem. The existing CFO estimation algorithms incur tremendous increase in complexity with increasing number of base station (BS) antennas, M and number of user terminals (UTs) K (i.e. massive MIMO regime). In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel low-complexity algorithm for CFO estimation which uses the pilot signal received at the BS during special uplink slots. The total per-channel use complexity of the proposed algorithm increases only linearly with increasing M and is independent of K. Analysis reveals that the CFO estimation accuracy can be considerably improved by increasing M and K (i.e. massive MIMO regime). For example, for a fixed K and a fixed training length, the required per-user radiated power during uplink training decreases as \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} with increasing M.
