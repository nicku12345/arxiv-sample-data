We consider simultaneously identifying the membership and locations of point sources that are convolved with different low-pass point spread functions, from the observation of their superpositions. This problem arises in three-dimensional super-resolution single-molecule imaging, neural spike sorting, multi-user channel identification, among others. We propose a novel algorithm, based on convex programming, and establish its near-optimal performance guarantee for exact recovery by exploiting the sparsity of the point source model as well as incoherence between the point spread functions. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
