This paper presents a hardware architecture of fast simplified successive cancellation (fast-SSC) algorithm for polar codes, which significantly reduces the decoding latency and dramatically increases the throughput. Algorithmically, fast-SSC algorithm suffers from the fact that its decoder scheduling and the consequent architecture depends on the code rate; this is a challenge for rate-compatible system. However, by exploiting the homogeneousness between the decoding processes of fast constituent polar codes and regular polar codes, the presented design is compatible with any rate. The scheduling plan and the intendedly designed process core are also described. Results show that, compared with the state-of-art decoder, proposed design can achieve at least 60% latency reduction for the codes with length N = 1024. By using Nangate FreePDK 45nm process, proposed design can reach throughput up to 5.81 Gbps and 2.01 Gbps for (1024, 870) and (1024, 512) polar code, respectively.
