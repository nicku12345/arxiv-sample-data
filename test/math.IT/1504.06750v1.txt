The constructive interference concept in the downlink of multiple-antenna systems is addressed in this paper. The concept of the joint exploitation of the channel state information (CSI) and data information (DI) is discussed. Using symbol-level precoding, the interference between data streams is transformed Under certain conditions into useful signal that can improve the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) of the downlink transmissions. In the previous work, different constructive interference precoding techniques have been proposed for the MPSK scenario. In this context, a novel constructive interference precoding technique that tackles the transmit power minimization (min-power) with individual SINR constraints at each user's receivers is proposed assuming MQAM modulation. Extensive simulations are performed to validate the proposed technique.
