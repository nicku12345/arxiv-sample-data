Packet erasure codes are today a real alternative to replication in fault tolerant distributed storage systems. In this paper, we propose the Mojette erasure code based on the Mojette transform, a formerly tomographic tool. The performance of coding and decoding are compared to the Reed-Solomon code implementations of the two open-source reference libraries namely ISA-L and Jerasure 2.0. Results clearly show better performances for our discrete geometric code compared to the classical algebraic approaches. A gain factor up to 2 is measured in comparison with the ISA-L Intel . Those very good performances allow to deploy Mojette erasure code for hot data distributed storage and I/O intensive applications.
