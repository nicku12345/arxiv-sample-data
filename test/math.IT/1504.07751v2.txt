In this letter, the performance of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is investigated from an information theoretic perspective. The relationships among the capacity region of broadcast channels and two rate regions achieved by NOMA and time-division multiple access (TDMA) are illustrated first. Then, the performance of NOMA is evaluated by considering TDMA as the benchmark, where both the sum rate and the individual user rates are used as the criteria. In a wireless downlink scenario with user pairing, the developed analytical results show that NOMA can outperform TDMA not only for the sum rate but also for each user's individual rate, particularly when the difference between the users' channels is large.
