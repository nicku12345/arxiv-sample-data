In this article, we study skew cyclic codes over ring R=\mathbb{F}_{q}+v\mathbb{F}_{q}+v^{2}\mathbb{F}_{q}, where q=p^{m}, p is an odd prime and v^{3}=v. We describe generator polynomials of skew cyclic codes over this ring and investigate the structural properties of skew cyclic codes over R by a decomposition theorem. We also describe the generator polynomials of the duals of skew cyclic codes. Moreover, the idempotent generators of skew cyclic codes over \mathbb{F}_{q} and R are considered.
