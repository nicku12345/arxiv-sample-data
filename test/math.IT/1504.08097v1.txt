In this paper, we study the linear codes over the commutative ring R=\F_{q}+v\F_{q}+v^{2}\F_{q} and their Gray images, where v^{3}=v. We define the Lee weight of the elements of R, we give a Gray map from R^{n} to \F^{3n}_{q} and we give the relation between the dual and the Gray image of a code. This allows us to investigate the structure and properties of self-dual cyclic, formally self-dual and the Gray image of formally self-dual codes over R. Further, we give several constructions of formally self-dual codes over R
