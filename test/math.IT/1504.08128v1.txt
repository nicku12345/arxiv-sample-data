In this paper, we will study some connections between Hilbert al- gebras and binary block-codes.With these codes, we can eassy obtain orders which determine suplimentary properties on these algebras. We will try to emphasize how, using binary block-codes, we can provide examples of classes of Hilbert algebras with some properties, in our case, classes of semisimple Hilbert algebras and classes of local Hilbert algebras.
