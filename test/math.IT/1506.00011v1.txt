We characterize group symmetries of poly-phase complementary code matrices (CCMs), which we use to classify CCMs in terms of their equivalence classes. We also present classification results for CCMs of dimension N\times 4 where N=2,3,4,5,6. Finally, we present a new construction to generate quad-phase CCMs from ternary CCMs and compare this to other existing constructions that focus on generating CCMs from those of smaller dimensions.
