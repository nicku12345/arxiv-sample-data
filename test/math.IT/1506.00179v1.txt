We study Sigma-Delta (\Sigma\Delta) quantization of oversampled bandlimited functions. We prove that digitally integrating blocks of bits and then down-sampling, a process known as decimation, can efficiently encode the associated \Sigma\Delta bit-stream. It allows a large reduction in the bit-rate while still permitting good approximation of the underlying bandlimited function via an appropriate reconstruction kernel. Specifically, in the case of stable rth order \Sigma\Delta schemes we show that the reconstruction error decays exponentially in the bit-rate. For example, this result applies to the 1-bit, greedy, first-order \Sigma\Delta scheme.
