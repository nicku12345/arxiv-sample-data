We study the problem of jointly sparse support recovery with 1-bit compressive measurements in a sensor network. Sensors are assumed to observe sparse signals having the same but unknown sparse support. Each sensor quantizes its measurement vector element-wise to 1-bit and transmits the quantized observations to a fusion center. We develop a computationally tractable support recovery algorithm which minimizes a cost function defined in terms of the likelihood function and the l_{1,\infty} norm. We observe that even with noisy 1-bit measurements, jointly sparse support can be recovered accurately with multiple sensors each collecting only a small number of measurements.
