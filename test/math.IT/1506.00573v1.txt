Recording experiments and decoding algorithms are presented for evaluating the bit-error-rate of state-of-the-art magnetic bitpatterned media. The recording experiments are performed with a static tester and conventional hard-disk-drive heads. As the reader dimensions are larger than the bit dimensions in both the down-track and the cross-track directions, a two-dimensional bit decoding algorithm is required. Two such algorithms are presented in details together with the methodology implemented to accurately retrieve island positions during recording. Using these techniques, a 1.6 Td/in^2 magnetic bit pattern media is demonstrated to support 2D bit error rates below 1e-2 under shingled magnetic recording conditions.
