In this paper, we study the impact of frequency-selectivity on the gap between the required per-user transmit power in the residual CFO scenario (i.e. after CFO estimation/compensation at the base-station (BS) from [6]) and that in the ideal/zero CFO scenario, for a fixed per-user information rate, in single-carrier massive MU-MIMO uplink systems with the TR-MRC receiver. Information theoretic analysis reveals that this gap decreases with increasing frequency-selectivity of the channel. Also, in the residual CFO scenario, an \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{M}) array gain is still achievable (M is the number of BS antennas) in frequency-selective channels with imperfect channel estimates.
