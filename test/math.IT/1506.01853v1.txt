In this paper, we study resource allocation for a full-duplex (FD) radio base station serving multiple half-duplex (HD) downlink and uplink users simultaneously. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account minimum required receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) for downlink and uplink communication and maximum tolerable SINRs at potential eavesdroppers. The proposed optimization framework enables secure downlink and uplink communication via artificial noise generation in the downlink for interfering the potential eavesdroppers. We minimize the weighted sum of the total downlink and uplink transmit power by jointly optimizing the downlink beamformer, the artificial noise covariance matrix, and the uplink transmit power. We adopt a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach to obtain a tractable solution for the considered problem. The tightness of the SDP relaxation is revealed by examining a sufficient condition for the global optimality of the solution. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance achieved by the proposed scheme and the significant transmit power savings enabled optimization of the artificial noise covariance matrix.
