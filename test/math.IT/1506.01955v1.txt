Linear Complementary Dual codes (LCD) are binary linear codes that meet their dual trivially. We construct LCD codes using orthogonal matrices, self-dual codes, combinatorial designs and Gray map from codes over the family of rings R_k. We give a linear programming bound on the largest size of an LCD code of given length and minimum distance. We make a table of lower bounds for this combinatorial function for modest values of the parameters.
