We investigate if feedback can increase the capacity of an energy harvesting communication channel where a transmitter powered by an exogenous energy arrival process and equipped with a finite battery communicates to a receiver over a memoryless channel. For a simple special case where the energy arrival process is deterministic and the channel is a BEC, we explicitly compute the feed-forward and feedback capacities and show that feedback can strictly increase the capacity of this channel. Building on this example, we also show that feedback can increase the capacity when the energy arrivals are i.i.d. known noncausally at the transmitter and the receiver.
