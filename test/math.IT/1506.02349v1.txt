We consider the complexities of repair algorithms for locally repairable codes and propose a class of codes that repair single node failures using addition operations only, or codes with addition based repair. We construct two families of codes with addition based repair. The first family attains distance one less than the Singleton-like upper bound, while the second family attains the Singleton-like upper bound.
