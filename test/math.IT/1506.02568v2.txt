The expicit restricted isometry property (RIP) measurement matrices are needed in practical application of compressed sensing in signal processing. RIP matrices from Reed-Solomon codes, BCH codes, orthogonal codes, expander graphs have been proposed and analysised. On the other hand binary constant weight codes have been studied for many years and many optimal or near-optimal small weight and ditance constant weight codes have been determined. In this paper we propose a new deterministic construction of RIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing from binary and ternary contant weight codes. The sparse orders and the number of budged rows in the new constant-weight-code-based RIP matrices can be arbitrary. These contant-weight-code based RIP matrices have better parameters compared with the DeVore RIP matrices when the sizes are small.
