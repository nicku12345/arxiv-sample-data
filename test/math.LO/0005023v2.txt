We introduce the notion of a meromorphic group, weakening somewhat Fujiki's definition We prove that a meromorphic group is meromorphically an extension of a complex torus by a linear algebraic group, generalizing results in [Fujiki, 1978]. A special case of this result, as well as one of the ingredients in the proof, is that a strongly minimal "modular" meromorphic group is a complex torus, answering a question of Hrushovski. As a consequence, we show that a simple compact complex manifold has algebraic and Kummer dimension zero if an only if its generic type is trivial.
