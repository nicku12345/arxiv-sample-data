We develop in this paper the theory of covers for Hausdorff properly \bigvee -definable manifolds with definable choice in an o-minimal structure \N. In particular, we show that given an \N-definably connected \N-definable group G we have 1\to \pi_1(G)\to \tilde{G}\stackrel{p}\to G\to 1 in the category of strictly properly \bigvee -definable groups with strictly properly \bigvee -definable homomorphisms, where \pi_1(G) is the o-minimal fundamental group of G.
