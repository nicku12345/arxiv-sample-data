A Hausdorff topological space X is van der Waerden if for every sequence (x_n)_n in X there is a converging subsequence (x_n)_{n in A} where subset A of omega contains arithmetic progressions of all finite lengths. A Hausdorff topological space X is Hindman if for every sequence (x_n)_n in X there is an IP-converging subsequence (x_n)_{n in FS(B)} for some infinite subset B of omega. We show that the continuum hypothesis implies the existence of a van der Waerden space which is not Hindman.
