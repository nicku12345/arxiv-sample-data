We strengthen non-structure theorems for almost free Abelian groups by studying long Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games between a fixed group of cardinality lambda and a free Abelian group. A group is called epsilon-game-free if the isomorphism player has a winning strategy in the game (of the described form) of length epsilon in lambda. We prove for a large set of successor cardinals lambda=mu^+ existence of nonfree (mu*omega_1)-game-free groups of cardinality lambda. We concentrate on successors of singular cardinals.
