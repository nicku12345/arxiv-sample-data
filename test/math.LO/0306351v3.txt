We obtain general estimates for exponential integrals of the form \[ E_f(y)=\int_{\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{n}}\psi(\sum_{j=1}^r y_j f_j(x))|dx|, \] where the f_j are restricted power series over \mathbb{Q}_p, y_j\in\mathbb{Q}_p, and \psi a nontrivial additive character on \mathbb{Q}_p. We prove that if (f_1,...,f_r) is a dominant map, then |E_f(y)| < c|y|^{\alpha} for some c>0 and \alpha<0, uniform in y, where |y|=\max(|y_i|)_i. In fact, we obtain similar estimates for a much bigger class of exponential integrals. To prove these estimates we introduce a new method to study exponential sums, namely, we use the theory of p-adic subanalytic sets and p-adic integration techniques based on p-adic cell decomposition. We compare our results to some elementarily obtained explicit bounds for E_f with f_j polynomials.
