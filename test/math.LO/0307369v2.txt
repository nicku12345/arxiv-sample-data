Let A\sub \R^{n+r} be a set definable in an o-minimal expansion \S of the real field, A' \sub \R^r be its projection, and assume that the non-empty fibers A_a \sub \R^n are compact for all a \in A' and uniformly bounded, {\em i.e.} all fibers are contained in a ball of fixed radius B(0,R). If L is the Hausdorff limit of a sequence of fibers A_{a_i}, we give an upper-bound for the Betti numbers b_k(L) in terms of definable sets explicitly constructed from a fiber A_a. In particular, this allows to establish effective complexity bounds in the semialgebraic case and in the Pfaffian case. In the Pfaffian setting, Gabrielov introduced the {\em relative closure} to construct the o-minimal structure \S_\pfaff generated by Pfaffian functions in a way that is adapted to complexity problems. Our results can be used to estimate the Betti numbers of a relative closure (X,Y)_0 in the special case where Y is empty.
