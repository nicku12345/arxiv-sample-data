We first determine the maximal clones on a set X of infinite regular cardinality which contain all permutations but not all unary functions, extending a result of Heindorf's for countably infinite X. If |X| is countably infinite or weakly compact, this yields a list of all maximal clones containing the permutations since in that case the maximal clones above the unary functions are known. We then generalize a result of Gavrilov's to obtain on all infinite X a list of all maximal submonoids of the monoid of unary functions which contain the permutations.
