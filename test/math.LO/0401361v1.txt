We say that a first order formula \Phi defines a graph G if \Phi is true on G and false on every graph G' non-isomorphic with G. Let D(G) be the minimal quantifier rank of a such formula. We prove that, if G is a tree of bounded degree or a Hamiltonian (equivalently, 2-connected) outerplanar graph, then D(G)=O(\log n), where n denotes the order of G. This bound is optimal up to a constant factor. If h is a constant, for connected graphs with no minor K_h and degree O(\sqrt n/\log n), we prove the bound D(G)=O(\sqrt n). This result applies to planar graphs and, more generally, to graphs of bounded genus.
