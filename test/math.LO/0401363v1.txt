Given a graph G, we consider a game where two players, A and B, alternatingly color edges of G in red and in blue respectively. Let l(G) be the maximum number of moves in which B is able to keep the red and the blue subgraphs isomorphic, if A plays optimally to destroy the isomorphism. This value is a lower bound for the duration of any avoidance game on G under the assumption that B plays optimally. We prove that if G is a path or a cycle of odd length n, then \Omega(\log n)\le l(G)\le O(\log^2 n). The lower bound is based on relations with Ehrenfeucht games from model theory. We also consider complete graphs and prove that l(K_n)=O(1).
