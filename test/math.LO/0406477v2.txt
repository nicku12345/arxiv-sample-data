We improve the known results about the complexity of the relation of isomorphism between separable Banach spaces up to Borel reducibility, and we achieve this using the classical spaces c_0, \ell_p and L_p, 1 \leq p <2. More precisely, we show that the relation E_{K_{\sigma}} is Borel reducible to isomorphism and complemented biembeddability between subspaces of c_0 or \ell_p, 1 \leq p <2. We show that the relation E_{K_{\sigma}} \otimes =^+ is Borel reducible to isomorphism, complemented biembeddability, and Lipschitz equivalence between subspaces of L_p, 1 \leq p <2.
