We give a combinatorial equivalent to the existence of a non-free hereditarily separable group of cardinality aleph_1. This can be used, together with a known combinatorial equivalent of the existence of a non-free Whitehead group, to prove that it is consistent that every Whitehead group is free but not every hereditarily separable group is free. We also show that the fact that Z is a p.i.d. with infinitely many primes is essential for this result.
