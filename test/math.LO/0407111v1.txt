A Banach space contains either a minimal subspace or a continuum of incomparable subspaces. General structure results for analytic equivalence relations are applied in the context of Banach spaces to show that if E_0 does not reduce to isomorphism of the subspaces of a space, in particular, if the subspaces of the space admit a classification up to isomorphism by real numbers, then any subspace with an unconditional basis is isomorphic to its square and hyperplanes and has an isomorphically homogeneous subsequence.
