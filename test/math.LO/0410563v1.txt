We study the quasi-endomorphism ring of infinitely definable subgroups in separably closed fields. Based on the results we obtain, we are able to prove a Mordell-Lang theorem for Drinfeld modules of finite characteristic. Using specialization arguments we are able to prove also a Mordell-Lang theorem for Drinfeld modules of generic characteristic.
