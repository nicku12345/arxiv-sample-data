For every variety of algebras and every algebras in these variety we can consider an algebraic geometry. Algebras may be many sorted (not necessarily one sorted) algebras. A set of sorts is fixed for each variety. This theory can be applied to the variety of representations of groups over fixed commutative ring with unit. We consider a representation as two sorted algebra. We concentrate on the case of the action type algebraic geometry of representations of groups. In this case algebraic sets are defined by systems of action type equations and equations in the acting group are not considered. This is the special case, which cannot be deduced from the general theory. In this paper the following basic notions are introduced: action type geometrical equivalence of two representations, action type quasi-identity in representations, action type quasi-variety of representations, action type Noetherian variety of representations, action type geometrically Noetherian representation, action type logically Noetherian representation.
