In this paper we generalize to unbounded convex subsets C of hyperbolic spaces results obtained by W.A. Kirk and R. Espinola on approximate fixed points of nonexpansive mappings in product spaces (C\times M)_\infty, where M is a metric space and C is a nonempty, convex, closed and bounded subset of a normed or a CAT(0)-space. We extend the results further, to families (C_u)_{u\in M} of unbounded convex subsets of a hyperbolic space. The key ingredient in obtaining these generalizations is a uniform quantitative version of a theorem due to Borwein, Reich and Shafrir, obtained by the authors in a previous paper using techniques from mathematical logic. Inspired by that, we introduce in the last section the notion of uniform approximate fixed point property for sets C and classes of self-mappings of C. The paper ends with an open problem.
