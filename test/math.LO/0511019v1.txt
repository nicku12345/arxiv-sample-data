In this paper we obtain a quadratic bound on the rate of asymptotic regularity for the Krasnoselski-Mann iterations of nonexpansive mappings in CAT(0)-spaces, whereas previous results guarantee only exponential bounds. The method we use is to extend to the more general setting of uniformly convex hyperbolic spaces a quantitative version of a strengthening of Groetsch's theorem obtained by Kohlenbach using methods from mathematical logic (so-called ``proof mining'').
