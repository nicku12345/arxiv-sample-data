We give a presentation of various results on zero-groups in o-minimal structures together with some new observations. In particular we prove that if G is a definably connected definably compact group in an o-minimal expansion of a real closed field, then for any maximal definably connected abelian subgroup T of G, G is the union of the conjugates of T. This can be seen as a generalization of the classical theorem that a compact connected Lie group is the union of the conjugates of any of its maximal tori.
