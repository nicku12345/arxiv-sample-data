Presented, in this monograph, are the results of the U. S. Naval Academy Mathematical Logic Course Project. The propositional and predicate calculus is presented in a unique manner. All aspects are rigorously established using the the fewest mathematical techniques. The propositional calculus is expanded considerably and many of the proof methods are used to establish the predicate calculus results. Consequnce operators are also introduced. Further, the material is considered to be a terminal experience and is directed towards applications such as logic-networks, procedures to determine the validity of arguments, the simple consistency of some sets of hypotheses, some concrete and abstract model theory and, by the Compactness Theorem, the generation of infinitesimals, ultrawords and ultralogics.
