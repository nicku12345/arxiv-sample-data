Let ^*\mathbb{R} be a nonstandard extension of \mathbb{R} and \rho be a positive infinitesimal in ^*\mathbb{R}. We show how to create a variety of isomorphisms between A. Robinson's field of asymptotic numbers ^\rho\mathbb{R} and the Hahn field \hat{^\rho\mathbb{R}}(t^\mathbb{R}), where \hat{^\rho\mathbb{R}} is the residue class field of ^\rho\mathbb{R}. Then, assuming that ^*\mathbb{R} is fully saturated we show that \hat{^\rho\mathbb{R}} is isomorphic to ^*\mathbb{R} and so ^\rho\mathbb{R} contains a copy of ^*\mathbb{R}. As a consequence (that is important for applications in non-linear theory of generalized functions) we show that every two fields of asymptotic numbers corresponding to different scales are isomorphic.
