Two important classes of quantum structures, namely orthomodular posets and orthomodular lattices, can be characterized in a classical context, using notions like partial information and points of view. Using the formalism of representation systems, we show that these quantum structures can be obtained by expressing conditions on the existence of particular points of view, of particular ways to observe a system.
