We use Shelah's theory of possible cofinalities in order to solve a problem about ultrafilters.   THEOREM. Suppose that  \lambda  is a singular cardinal,  \lambda ' < \lambda , and the ultrafilter D is  \kappa -decomposable for all regular cardinals  \kappa  with  \lambda ' < \kappa < \lambda . Then D is either  \lambda -decomposable, or  \lambda ^+-decomposable.   We give applications to topological spaces and to abstract logics.
