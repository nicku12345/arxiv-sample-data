In this paper we prove a single exponential upper bound on the number of possible homotopy types of the fibres of a Pfaffian map, in terms of the format of its graph. In particular we show that if a semi-algebraic set S \subset {\R}^{m+n}, where \R is a real closed field, is defined by a Boolean formula with s polynomials of degrees less than d, and \pi: {\R}^{m+n} \to {\R}^n is the projection on a subspace, then the number of different homotopy types of fibres of \pi does not exceed s^{2(m+1)n}(2^m nd)^{O(nm)}. As applications of our main results we prove single exponential bounds on the number of homotopy types of semi-algebraic sets defined by fewnomials, and by polynomials with bounded additive complexity. We also prove single exponential upper bounds on the radii of balls guaranteeing local contractibility for semi-algebraic sets defined by polynomials with integer coefficients.
