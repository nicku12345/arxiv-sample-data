The logical depth of a graph G is the minimum quantifier depth of a first order sentence defining G up to isomorphism in the language of the adjacency and the equality relations. We consider the case that G is a dissection of a convex polygon or, equivalently, a biconnected outerplanar graph. We bound the logical depth of a such G from above by a function of combinatorial parameters of the dual tree of G.
