A space X is said to be \kappa-resolvable (resp. almost \kappa-resolvable) if it contains \kappa dense sets that are pairwise disjoint (resp. almost disjoint over the ideal of nowhere dense subsets). X is maximally resolvable iff it is \Delta(X)-resolvable, where \Delta(X) = \min\{|G| : G \ne \emptyset {open}\}.   We show that every crowded monotonically normal (in short: MN) space is \omega-resolvable and almost \mu-resolvable, where \mu = \min\{2^{\omega}, \omega_2 \}. On the other hand, if \kappa is a measurable cardinal then there is a MN space X with \Delta(X) = \kappa such that no subspace of X is \omega_1-resolvable.   Any MN space of cardinality < \aleph_\omega is maximally resolvable. But from a supercompact cardinal we obtain the consistency of the existence of a MN space X with |X| = \Delta(X) = \aleph_{\omega} such that no subspace of X is \omega_2-resolvable.
