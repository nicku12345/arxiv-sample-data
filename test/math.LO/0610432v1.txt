Nagata conjectured that every M-space is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of the product of a countably compact space and a metric space. This conjecture was refuted by Burke and van Douwen, and A. Kato, independently.   However, we can show that there is a c.c.c. poset P of size 2^{\omega} such that in V^P Nagata's conjecture holds for each first countable regular space from the ground model (i.e. if a first countable regular space X\in V is an M-space in V^P then it is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of the product of a countably compact space and a metric space in V^P). In fact, we show that every first countable regular space from the ground model has a first countable countably compact extension in V^P, and then apply some results of Morita. As a corollary, we obtain that every first countable regular space from the ground model has a maximal first countable extension in model V^P.
