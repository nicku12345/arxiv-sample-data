We present a Banach space \mathfrak X with a Schauder basis of length \omega\_1 which is saturated by copies of c\_0 and such that for every closed decomposition of a closed subspace X=X\_0\oplus X\_1, either X\_0 or X\_1 has to be separable. This can be considered as the non-separable counterpart of the notion of hereditarily indecomposable space. Indeed, the subspaces of \mathfrak X have ``few operators'' in the sense that every bounded operator T:X \to \mathfrak{X} from a subspace X of \mathfrak{X} into \mathfrak{X} is the sum of a multiple of the inclusion and a \omega\_1-singular operator, i.e., an operator S which is not an isomorphism on any non-separable subspace of X. We also show that while \mathfrak{X} is not distortable (being c\_0-saturated), it is arbitrarily \omega\_1-distortable in the sense that for every \lambda>1 there is an equivalent norm \||\cdot \|| on \mathfrak{X} such that for every non-separable subspace X of \mathfrak{X} there are x,y\in S\_X such that \||\cdot \|| / \||\cdot \||\ge \la.
