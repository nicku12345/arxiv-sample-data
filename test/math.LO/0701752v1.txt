Let A be an infinitely generated free abelian group. We prove that the automorphism group \aut A first-order interprets the full second-order theory of the set |A| with no structure. In particular, this implies that the automorphism groups of two infinitely generated free abelian groups A_1,A_2 are elementarily equivalent if and only if the sets |A_1|,|A_2| are second-order equivalent.
