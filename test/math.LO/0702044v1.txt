It is proved that (elementary) Chevalley groups G_\pi (\Phi,K) and G_{\pi'}(\Phi',K') (or E_\pi (\Phi,K) and E_{\pi'}(\Phi',K')) over infinite fields K and K' of characteristics \ne 2, with weight lattices \Lambda and \Lambda', respectively, are elementarily equivalent if and only if the root systems \Phi and \Phi' are isomorphic, the fields K and K' are elementarily equivalent, the lattices \Lambda and \Lambda' coincide.
