We study model-theoretic and stability-theoretic properies of the nonabelian free group in the light of Sela's recent result on stability and results announced by Bestvina and Feighn. We point out analogies between the free group and so-called bad groups of finite Morley rank and we prove non CM-triviality of the free group.
