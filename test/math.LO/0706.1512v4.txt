The mean ergodic theorem is equivalent to the assertion that for every function K and every epsilon, there is an n with the property that the ergodic averages A_m f are stable to within epsilon on the interval [n,K(n)]. We show that even though it is not generally possible to compute a bound on the rate of convergence of a sequence of ergodic averages, one can give explicit bounds on n in terms of K and || f || / epsilon. This tells us how far one has to search to find an n so that the ergodic averages are "locally stable" on a large interval. We use these bounds to obtain a similarly explicit version of the pointwise ergodic theorem, and show that our bounds are qualitatively different from ones that can be obtained using upcrossing inequalities due to Bishop and Ivanov. Finally, we explain how our positive results can be viewed as an application of a body of general proof-theoretic methods falling under the heading of "proof mining."
