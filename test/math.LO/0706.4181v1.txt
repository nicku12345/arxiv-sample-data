In his article "A discrete form of the theorem that each field endomorphism of \mathbb{R} (\mathbb{Q}_p) is the identity", Tyszka introduce a logical property which is equivalent to algebraicity in \mathbb{R} and in \mathbb{Q}_p. Amazingly, the property is no longer equivalent to algebraicity in \mathbb{C}. This article present a similirar property which is equivalent to algebraicity in any field of characteristic zero which is also a Banach space, and prove a weaker equivalency for fields of positive charcteristic (which are also Banach spaces).
