We undertake a case study of two series of nonclassical Zariski geometries. We show that these geometries can be realised as representations of certain noncommutative C^*-algebras and introduce a natural limit construction which for each of the two series produces a classical U(1)-gauge field over a 2-dimensional Riemann surface.
