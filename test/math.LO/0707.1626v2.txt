This paper provides a fixed point theorem for asymptotically nonexpansive mappings in uniformly convex hyperbolic spaces as well as new effective results on the Krasnoselski-Mann iterations of such mappings. The latter were found using methods from logic and the paper continues a case study in the general program of extracting effective data from prima-facie ineffective proofs in the fixed point theory of such mappings.
