The complete first order theories of the exponential differential equations of semiabelian varieties are given. It is shown that these theories also arises from an amalgamation-with-predimension construction in the style of Hrushovski. The theory includes necessary and sufficient conditions for a system of equations to have a solution. The necessary condition generalizes Ax's differential fields version of Schanuel's conjecture to semiabelian varieties. There is a purely algebraic corollary, the "Weak CIT" for semiabelian varieties, which concerns the intersections of algebraic subgroups with algebraic varieties.
