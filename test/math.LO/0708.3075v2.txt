Julia Robinson has given a first-order definition of the rational integers \mathbb Z in the rational numbers \mathbb Q by a formula (\forall \exists \forall \exists)(F=0) where the \forall-quantifiers run over a total of 8 variables, and where F is a polynomial.   We show that for a large class of number fields, not including \mathbb Q, for every \epsilon>0, there exists a set of primes \cal S of natural density exceeding 1-\epsilon, such that \mathbb Z can be defined as a subset of the ``large'' subring \{x \in K : \ord_{\mathfrak p}x >0, \forall \mathfrak p \not \in \cal S \} of K by a formula of the form (\exists \forall \exists)(F=0) where there is only one \forall-quantifier, and where F is a polynomial.
