Coherence with respect to Kelly-Mac Lane graphs is proved for categories that correspond to the multiplicative fragment without constant propositions of classical linear first-order predicate logic without or with mix. To obtain this result, coherence is first established for categories that correspond to the multiplicative conjunction-disjunction fragment with first-order quantifiers of classical linear logic, a fragment lacking negation. These results extend results published in previous two books by the authors, where coherence was established for categories of the corresponding fragments of propositional classical linear logic, which are related to proof nets, and which could be described as star-autonomous categories without unit objects.
