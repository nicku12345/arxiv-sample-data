We prove that the first-order theory of any function field K of characteristic p>2 is undecidable in the language of rings without parameters. When K is a function field in one variable whose constant field is algebraic over a finite field, we can also prove undecidability in characteristic 2. The proof uses a result by Moret-Bailly about ranks of elliptic curves over function fields.
