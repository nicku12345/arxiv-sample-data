The paper provides an introduction to the field of Algebraic Set Theory (AST). AST is a flexible categorical framework for studying different kinds of set theories: both classical and constructive, predicative and impredicative. We discuss the basic results in this area, with a particular emphasis on applications to the constructive set theories IZF and CZF. (This paper is a summary of a tutorial on categorical logic given by the second named author at the Logic Colloquium 2006 in Nijmegen.)
