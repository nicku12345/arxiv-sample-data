This paper is the first in a series of three, the aim of which is to lay the foundations of algebraic geometry over the free metabelian Lie algebra F. In the current paper we introduce the notion of a metabelian Lie U-algebra and establish connections between metabelian Lie U-algebras and special matrix Lie algebras. We define the \Delta -localisation of a metabelian Lie U-algebra A and the direct module extension of the Fitting's radical of A and show that these algebras lie in the universal closure of A.
