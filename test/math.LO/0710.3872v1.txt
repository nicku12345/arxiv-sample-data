This paper is the second in a series of three, the aim of which is to construct algebraic geometry over a free metabelian Lie algebra F. For the universal closure of free metabelian Lie algebra of finite rank r \ge 2 over a finite field k we find a convenient set of axioms in the language of Lie algebras L and the language L_{F} enriched by constants from F. We give a description of:   * The structure of finitely generated algebras from the universal closure of F_r in both L and L_{F_r}   * The structure of irreducible algebraic sets over F_r  and respective coordinate algebras.   We also prove that the universal theory of a free metabelian Lie algebra over a finite field is decidable in both languages.
