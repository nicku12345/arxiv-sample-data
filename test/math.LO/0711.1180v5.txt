Tao has recently proved that if T_1,...,T_l are commuting, invertible, measure-preserving transformations on a dynamical system then for any L^\infty functions f_1,...,f_l, the average \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\prod_{i\leq l}f_i\circ T^n_i converges in the L^2 norm. Tao's proof is unusual in that it translates the problem into a more complicated statement about the combinatorics of finite spaces by using the Furstenberg correspondence "backwards". In this paper, we give an ergodic proof of this theorem, essentially a translation of Tao's argument to the ergodic setting. In order to do this, we develop two new variations on the usual Furstenberg correspondence, both of which take recurrence-type statements in one dynamical system and give equivalent statements in a different dynamical system with desirable properties.
