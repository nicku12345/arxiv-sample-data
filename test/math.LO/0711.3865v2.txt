This second part of the paper strengthens the descent theory described in the first part to rational maps, arbitrary base fields, and dynamics given by correspondences. We obtain in particular a decomposition of any difference field extension into a tower of finite, field-internal and one-based difference field extensions. This is needed in order to obtain the "dynamical Northcott" Theorem 1.11 of Part I in sharp form.
