We show that a minimal nonalgebraic simple groups of finite Morley rank has Prufer rank at most 2, and eliminates tameness from Cherlin and Jaligot's past work on minimal simple groups. The argument given here begins with the strongly embedded minimal simple configuration of Borovik, Burdges and Nesin. The 0-unipotence machinery of Burdges's thesis is used to analyze configurations involving nonabelian intersections of Borel subgroups. The number theoretic punchline of Cherlin and Jaligot has been replaced with a new genericity argument.
