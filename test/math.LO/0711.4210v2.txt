We show that a minimal counter example to the Cherlin-Zilber Algebraicity Conjecture for simple groups of finite Morley rank has Prufer 2-rank at most two. This article covers the signalizer functor theory and identifies the groups of Lie rank at least three; leaving the uniqueness case analysis to previous articles. This result signifies the end of the general methods used to handle large groups; hereafter each individual group PSL_2, PSL_3, PSp_4, and G_2 will require its own identification theorem.
