We reconsider some classical natural semantics of integers (namely iterators of functions, cardinals of sets, index of equivalence relations), in the perspective of Kolmogorov complexity. To each such semantics one can attach a simple representation of integers that we suitably effectivize in order to develop an associated Kolmogorov theory. Such effectivizations are particular instances of a general notion of "self-enumerated system" that we introduce in this paper. Our main result asserts that, with such effectivizations, Kolmogorov theory allows to quantitatively distinguish the underlying semantics. We characterize the families obtained by such effectivizations and prove that the associated Kolmogorov complexities constitute a hierarchy which coincides with that of Kolmogorov complexities defined via jump oracles and/or infinite computations. This contrasts with the well-known fact that usual Kolmogorov complexity does not depend (up to a constant) on the chosen arithmetic representation of integers, let it be in any base unary, binary et so on. Also, in a conceptual point of view, our result can be seen as a mean to measure the degree of abstraction of these diverse semantics.
