We deal with two forms of the "uniqueness cases" in the classification of large simple K^*-groups of finite Morley rank of odd type, where large means the m_2(G) at least three. This substantially extends results known for even larger groups having \Prufer 2-rank at least three, to cover the two groups \PSp_4 and \G_2. With an eye towards distant developments, we carry out this analysis for L^*-groups which is substantially broader than the K^* setting.
