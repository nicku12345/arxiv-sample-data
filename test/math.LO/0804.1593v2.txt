In 2003, Kechris, Pestov and Todorcevic showed that the structure of certain separable metric spaces - called ultrahomogeneous - is closely related to the combinatorial behavior of the class of their finite metric spaces. The purpose of the present paper is to explore the different aspects of this connection.
