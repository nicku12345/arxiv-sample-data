We give a negative answer to a question of Erdos and Hajnal: it is consistent that GCH holds and there is a colouring c:[{\omega_2}]^2\to 2 establishing \omega_2 \not\to [(\omega_1;{\omega})]^2_2 such that some colouring g:[\omega_1]^2\to 2 can not be embedded into c. It is also consistent that 2^{\omega_1} is arbitrarily large, and a function g establishes 2^{\omega_1} \not\to [(\omega_1,\omega_2)]^2_{\omega_1} such that there is no uncountable g-rainbow subset of 2^{\omega_1}. We also show that for each k\in {\omega} it is consistent with Martin's Axiom that the negative partition relation \omega_1 \not\to^* [(\omega_1;\omega_1)]_{k-bdd} holds.
