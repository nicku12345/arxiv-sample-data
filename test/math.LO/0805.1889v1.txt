Let p be a fixed prime. An Abelian p-group is an Abelian group (not necessarily finitely generated) in which every element has for its order some power of p. The countable Abelian p-groups are classified by Ulm's theorem, and Khisamiev characterized the Abelian p-groups with computable copies. A computable structure A is said to be \Delta^0_\alpha categorical if for any computable structure B isomorphic to A there is a \Delta^0_\alpha function witnessing that the two are isomorphic.   The present paper seeks to characterize \Delta^0_\alpha categoricity for Abelian p-groups, and results of this kind are given for broad classes of Abelian p-groups and values of \alpha. The remaining open cases are exhaustively described.
