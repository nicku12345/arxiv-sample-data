Let \ee>0 and \fff be a family of finite subsets of the Cantor set \ccc. Following D. H. Fremlin, we say that \fff is \ee-filling over \ccc if \fff is hereditary and for every F\subseteq\ccc finite there exists G\subseteq F such that G\in\fff and |G|\geq\ee |F|. We show that if \fff is \ee-filling over \ccc and C-measurable in [\ccc]^{<\omega}, then for every P\subseteq\ccc perfect there exists Q\subseteq P perfect with [Q]^{<\omega}\subseteq\fff. A similar result for weaker versions of density is also obtained.
