We show that for every separable Banach space X, either \spw(X) (the set of all spreading models of X generated by weakly-null sequences in X, modulo equivalence) is countable, or \spw(X) contains an antichain of the size of the continuum. This answers a question of S. J. Dilworth, E. Odell and B. Sari.
