We characterize those classes \ccc of separable Banach spaces admitting a separable universal space Y (that is, a space Y containing, up to isomorphism, all members of \ccc) which is not universal for all separable Banach spaces. The characterization is a byproduct of the fact, proved in the paper, that the class \mathrm{NU} of non-universal separable Banach spaces is strongly bounded. This settles in the affirmative the main conjecture form \cite{AD}. Our approach is based, among others, on a construction of \llll_\infty-spaces, due to J. Bourgain and G. Pisier. As a consequence we show that there exists a family \{Y_\xi:\xi<\omega_1\} of separable, non-universal, \llll_\infty-spaces which uniformly exhausts all separable Banach spaces. A number of other natural classes of separable Banach spaces are shown to be strongly bounded as well.
