We prove a structural property of the class of unconditionally saturated separable Banach spaces. We show, in particular, that for every analytic set \aaa, in the Effros-Borel space of subspaces of C[0,1], of unconditionally saturated separable Banach spaces, there exists an unconditionally saturated Banach space Y, with a Schauder basis, that contains isomorphic copies of every space X in the class \aaa.
