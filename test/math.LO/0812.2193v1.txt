We study how the existence in an algebraic lattice L of a chain of a given type is reflected in the join-semilattice K(L) of its compact elements. We show that for every chain \alpha of size \kappa, there is a set \B of at most 2^{\kappa} join-semilattices, each one having a least element such that an algebraic lattice L contains no chain of order type I(\alpha) if and only if the join-semilattice K(L) of its compact elements contains no join-subsemilattice isomorphic to a member of \B. We show that among the join-subsemilattices of [\omega]^{<\omega} belonging to \B, one is embeddable in all the others. We conjecture that if \alpha is countable, there is a finite set \B.
