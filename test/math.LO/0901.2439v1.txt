This paper illustrates the relationship between boolean propositional algebra and semirings, presenting some results of partial ordering on boolean propositional algebras, and the necessary conditions to represent a boolean propositional subalgebra as equivalent to a corresponding boolean propositional algebra. It is also shown that the images of a homomorphic function on a boolean propositional algebra have the relationship of boolean propositional algebra and its subalgebra. The necessary and sufficient conditions for that homomorphic function to be onto-order preserving, and also an extension of boolean propositional algebra, are explored.
