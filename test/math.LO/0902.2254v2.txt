n infinite two-player zero-sum game with a Borel winning set, in which the opponent's actions are monitored eventually but not necessarily immediately after they are played, is determined. The proof relies on a representation of the game as a stochastic game with perfect information, in which Chance operates as a delegate for the players and performs the randomizations for them, and on Martin's Theorem about the determinacy of such games.
