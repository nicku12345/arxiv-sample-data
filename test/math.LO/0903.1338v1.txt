We classify the algebraic combinatorial geometries of arbitrary field extensions of transcendence degree greater than 4 and describe their groups of automorphisms. Our results and proofs extend similar results and proofs by Evans and Hrushovski in the case of algebraically closed fields. The classification of projective planes in algebraic combinatorial geometries in arbitrary fields of characteristic zero will also be given.
