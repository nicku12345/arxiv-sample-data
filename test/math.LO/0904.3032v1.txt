We prove that in a connected group of finite Morley rank the centralizers of decent tori are connected. We then apply this result to the analysis of minimal connected simple groups of finite Morley rank. Our applications include general covering properties by Borel subgroups, the description of Weyl groups and the analysis of toral automorphisms.
