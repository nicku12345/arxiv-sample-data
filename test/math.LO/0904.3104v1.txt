We discuss the existence of complete accumulation points of sequences in products of topological spaces. Then we collect and generalize many of the results proved in Parts I, II and IV.   The present Part VI is complementary to Part V to the effect that here we deal, say, with uniformity, complete accumulation points and  \kappa -(\lambda)-compactness, rather than with regularity, [ \lambda, \mu ]-compactness and  \kappa - (\lambda, \mu)-compactness. Of course, if we restrict ourselves to regular cardinals, Parts V (for  \lambda = \mu) and Part VI essentially coincide.
