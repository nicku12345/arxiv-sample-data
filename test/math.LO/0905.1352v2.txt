Both algebraic and computational approaches for dealing with similarity spaces are well known in generalized rough set theory. However, these studies may be said to have been confined to particular perspectives of distinguishability in the context. In this research, the essence of an algebraic semantics that can deal with all possible concepts of distinguishability over similarity spaces is progressed. Key to this is the addition of choice-related operations to the semantics that have connections with modal logics as well. Among these we focus on a semantics that is based on local clear distinguishability over similarity spaces.
