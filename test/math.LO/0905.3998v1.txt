In the refinement calculus, monotonic predicate transformers are used to model specifications for (imperative) programs. Together with a natural notion of simulation, they form a category enjoying many algebraic properties. We build on this structure to make predicate transformers into a de notational model of full linear logic: all the logical constructions have a natural interpretation in terms of predicate transformers (i.e. in terms of specifications). We then interpret proofs of a formula by a safety property for the corresponding specification.
