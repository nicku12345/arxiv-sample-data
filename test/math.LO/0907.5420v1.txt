We consider functions of natural numbers which allow a combinatorial interpretation as density functions (speed) of classes of relational structures, s uch as Fibonacci numbers, Bell numbers, Catalan numbers and the like. Many of these functions satisfy a linear recurrence relation over \mathbb Z or {\mathbb Z}_m and allow an interpretation as counting the number of relations satisfying a property expressible in Monadic Second Order Logic (MSOL).   C. Blatter and E. Specker (1981) showed that if such a function f counts the number of binary relations satisfying a property expressible in MSOL then f satisfies for every m \in \mathbb{N} a linear recurrence relation over \mathbb{Z}_m.   In this paper we give a complete characterization in terms of definability in MSOL of the combinatorial functions which satisfy a linear recurrence relation over \mathbb{Z}, and discuss various extensions and limitations of the Specker-Blatter theorem.
