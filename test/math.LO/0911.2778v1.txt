For f \colon [0,1] \rar \real^{+}, consider the relation \mathbf{E}_{f} on [0,1]^{\omega} defined by (x_{n}) \mathbf{E}_{f} (y_{n}) \Leftrightarrow \sum_{n < \omega} f(|y_{n} - x_{n}|) < \infty. We study the Borel reducibility of Borel equivalence relations of the form \mathbf{E}_{f}. Our results indicate that for every 1 \leq p < q < \infty, the order \leq_{B} of Borel reducibility on the set of equivalence relations \{\bE \colon \bE_{\Id^{p}} \leq_{B} \bE \leq_{B} \bE_{\Id^{q}}\} is more complicated than expected, e.g. consistently every linear order of cardinality continuum embeds into it.
