This paper is concerned with the values of Harish-Chandra characters of a class of positive-depth, toral, very supercuspidal representations of p-adic symplectic and special orthogonal groups, near the identity element. We declare two representations equivalent if their characters coincide on a specific neighbourhood of the identity (which is larger than the neighbourhood on which Harish-Chandra local character expansion holds). We construct a parameter space B (that depends on the group and a real number r>0) for the set of equivalence classes of the representations of minimal depth r satisfying some additional assumptions. This parameter space is essentially a geometric object defined over \Q. Given a non-Archimedean local field \K with sufficiently large residual characteristic, the part of the character table near the identity element for G(\K) that comes from our class of representations is parameterized by the residue-field points of B. The character values themselves can be recovered by specialization from a constructible motivic exponential function. The values of such functions are algorithmically computable. It is in this sense that we show that a large part of the character table of the group G(\K) is computable.
