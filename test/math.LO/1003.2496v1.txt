We show that it is consistent that the continuum is as large as you wish, and for each uncountable cardinal \kappa below the continuum, there are a subset T of the reals and a family A of countable subsets of T such that (1) both T and A have cardinality \kappa, (2) |\bar{a}\cap T|=\kappa for each a\in A, (3) for each uncountable subset of T contains some elements of A, and so (i) there is an almost disjoint family of subsets of the reals with size and chromatic number \kappa, (ii) there is a locally compact, locally countable T_2 space with cardinality spectrum \{\omega,\kappa\}.
