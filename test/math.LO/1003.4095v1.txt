We show that any non abelian free group \F is strongly \aleph_0-homogeneous, i.e. that finite tuples of elements which satisfy the same first-order properties are in the same orbit under \Aut(\F). We give a characterization of elements in finitely generated groups which have the same first-order properties as a primitive element of the free group. We deduce as a consequence that most hyperbolic surface groups are not \aleph_0-homogeneous.
