We introduce a covering notion depending on two cardinals, which we call \mathcal O - [ \mu, \lambda ]-compactness, and which encompasses both pseudocompactness and many other generalizations of pseudocompactness. For Tychonoff spaces, pseudocompactness turns out to be equivalent to \mathcal O - [ \omega, \omega ]-compactness. We provide several characterizations of \mathcal O - [ \mu, \lambda ]-compactness, and we discuss its connection with D-pseudocompactness, for D an ultrafilter. We analyze the behaviour of the above notions with respect to products. Finally, we show that our results hold in a more general framework, in which compactness properties are defined relative to an arbitrary family of subsets of some topological space X.
