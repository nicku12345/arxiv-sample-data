G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem is proved for Herbrand consistency of some arithmetical theories with bounded induction, by using a technique of logarithmic shrinking the witnesses of bounded formulas, due to Z. Adamowicz [Herbrand consistency and bounded arithmetic, \textit{Fundamenta Mathematicae} 171 (2002) 279--292]. In that paper, it was shown that one cannot always shrink the witness of a bounded formula logarithmically, but in the presence of Herbrand consistency, for theories {\rm I\Delta_0+\Omega_m} with m\geqslant 2, any witness for any bounded formula can be shortened logarithmically. This immediately implies the unprovability of Herbrand consistency of a theory T\supseteq {\rm I\Delta_0+\Omega_2} in T itself.   In this paper, the above results are generalized for {\rm I\Delta_0+\Omega_1}. Also after tailoring the definition of Herbrand consistency for {\rm I\Delta_0} we prove the corresponding theorems for {\rm I\Delta_0}. Thus the Herbrand version of G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem follows for the theories {\rm I\Delta_0+\Omega_1} and {\rm I\Delta_0}.
