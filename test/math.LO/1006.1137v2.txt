This paper has been withdrawn by the author. In this short paper I introduce a concept of possibility in order to vindicate Everett's Theory of many worlds. The main idea is that there is only one world: the real. After the wave-collapse, we have again only one world, but many possible worlds which have a different grade of possibility. In this sense 'possible' exclude the 'reality', opposing a long modal tradition.
