In this paper we analyse some notions of amoeba for tree forcings. In particular we introduce an amoeba-Silver and prove that it satisfies quasi pure decision but not pure decision. Further we define an amoeba-Sacks and prove that it satisfies the Laver property. We also show some application to regularity properties. We finally present a generalized version of amoeba and discuss some interesting associated questions.
