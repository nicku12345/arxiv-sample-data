We study dp-minimal infinite profinite groups that are equipped with a uniformly definable fundamental system of open subgroups. We show that these groups have an open subgroup A such that either A is a direct product of countably many copies of \mathbb{F}_p for some prime p, or A is of the form A \cong \prod_p \mathbb{Z}_p^{\alpha_p} \times A_p where \alpha_p < \omega and A_p is a finite abelian p-group for each prime p. Moreover, we show that if A is of this form, then there is a fundamental system of open subgroups such that the expansion of A by this family of subgroups is dp-minimal. Our main ingredient is a quantifier elimination result for a class of valued abelian groups. We also apply it to (\mathbb{Z},+) and we show that if we expand (\mathbb{Z},+) by any chain of subgroups (B_i)_{i<\omega}, we obtain a dp-minimal structure. This structure is distal if and only if the size of the quotients B_i/B_{i+1} is bounded.
