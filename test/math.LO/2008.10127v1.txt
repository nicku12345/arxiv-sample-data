We investigate what collections of c.e.\ Turing degrees can be realised as the collection of elements of a separating \Pi^0_1 class of c.e.\ degree. We show that for every c.e.\ degree \mathbf{c}, the collection \{\mathbf{c}, \mathbf{0}'\} can be thus realized. We also rule out several attempts at constructing separating classes realizing a unique c.e.\ degree. For example, we show that there is no \emph{super-maximal} pair: disjoint c.e.\ sets A and B whose separating class is infinite, but every separator of c.e.\ degree is a finite variant of either A or \overline{B}.
