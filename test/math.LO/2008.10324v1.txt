In this paper, we study several propositional team logics that are closed under unions, including propositional inclusion logic. We prove that all these logics are expressively complete, and we introduce sound and complete systems of natural deduction for these logics. We also show that these and many other expressively complete propositional team logics with the locality property enjoy the (uniform) interpolation property.
