K\"onig's edge coloring theorem says that a bipartite graph with maximal degree n has an edge coloring with no more than n colors. We explore the computability theory and Reverse Mathematics aspects of this theorem. Computable bipartite graphs with degree bounded by n have computable edge colorings with n+1 colors, but the theorem that there is an edge coloring with n colors is equivalent to WKLo over RCAo. This gives an additional proof of a theorem of Hirst: WKLo is equivalent over RCAo to the principle that every countable bipartite n-regular graph is the union of n complete matchings. We describe open questions related to Vizing's edge coloring theorem and a countable form of Birkhoff's theorem.
