Beklemishev introduced an ordinal notation system for the Feferman-Sch\"utte ordinal \Gamma_0 based on the autonomous expansion of provability algebras. In this paper we present the logic \textbf{BC} (for Bracket Calculus). The language of \textbf{BC} extends said ordinal notation system to a strictly positive modal language. Thus, unlike other provability logics, \textbf{BC} is based on a self-contained signature that gives rise to an ordinal notation system instead of modalities indexed by some ordinal given a priori. The presented logic is proven to be equivalent to \textbf{RC}_{\Gamma_0}, that is, to the strictly positive fragment of \textbf{GLP}_{\Gamma_0}. We then define a combinatorial statement based on \textbf{BC} and show it to be independent of the theory \textbf{ATR}_0 of Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion, a theory of second order arithmetic far more powerful than Peano Arithmetic.
