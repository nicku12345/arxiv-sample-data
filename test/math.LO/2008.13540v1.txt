A Kaufmann model is an \omega_1-like, recursively saturated, rather classless model of \mathrm{PA}. Such models were constructed by Kaufmann under \diamondsuit and Shelah showed they exist in \mathrm{ZFC} by an absoluteness argument. Kaufmann models are an important witness to the incompactness of \omega_1 similar to Aronszajn trees. In this paper we look at some set theoretic issues related to this motivated by the seemingly na\"{i}ve question of whether such a model can be ``killed" by forcing without collapsing \omega_1. We show that the answer to this question is independent of \mathrm{ZFC} and closely related to similar questions about Aronszajn trees. As an application of these methods we also show that it is independent of \mathrm{ZFC} whether or not Kaufmann models can be axiomatized in the logic L_{\omega_1, \omega} (Q) where Q is the quantifier ``there exists uncountably many".
