In this paper we continue to study varieties of K-lattices, focusing on their bounded versions. These (bounded) commutative residuated lattices arise from a specific kind of construction: the {\em twist-product} of a lattice. Twist-products were first considered by Kalman in 1958 to deal with order involutions on plain lattices, but the extension of this concept to residuated lattices has attracted some attention lately.
