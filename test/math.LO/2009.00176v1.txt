We show that intuitionistic quantifiers admit the following temporal interpretation: \forall x A is true at a world w iff A is true at every object in the domain of every future world, and \exists x A is true at w iff A is true at some object in the domain of some past world. For this purpose we work with a predicate version of the well-known tense propositional logic \sf S4.t. The predicate logic \sf Q^\circ S4.t is obtained by weakening the axioms of the standard predicate extension \sf QS4.t of \sf S4.t along the lines Corsi weakened \sf QK to \sf Q^\circ K. The G\"odel translation embeds the predicate intuitionistic logic \sf IQC into \sf QS4 fully and faithfully. We provide a temporal version of the G\"odel translation and prove that it embeds \sf IQC into \sf Q^\circ S4.t fully and faithfully; that is, we show that a sentence is provable in \sf IQC iff its translation is provable in \sf Q^\circ S4.t. Faithfulness is proved using syntactic methods, while we prove fullness utilizing the generalized Kripke semantics of Corsi.
