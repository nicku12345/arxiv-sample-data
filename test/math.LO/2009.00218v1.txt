In a recent paper we showed that intuitionistic quantifiers admit the following temporal interpretation: "always in the future" (for \forall) and "sometime in the past" (for \exists). In this paper we study this interpretation for the monadic fragment \sf MIPC of the intuitionistic predicate logic. It is well known that \sf MIPC is translated fully and faithfully into the monadic fragment \sf MS4 of the predicate \sf S4 (G\"{o}del translation). We introduce a new tense extension of \sf S4, denoted by \sf TS4, and provide an alternative full and faithful translation of \sf MIPC into \sf TS4, which yields the temporal interpretation of monadic intuitionistic quantifiers mentioned above. We compare this new translation with the G\"{o}del translation by showing that both \sf MS4 and \sf TS4 can be translated fully and faithfully into a tense extension of \sf MS4, which we denote by \sf MS4.t. This is done by utilizing the algebraic and relational semantics for the new logics introduced. As a byproduct, we prove the finite model property (fmp) for \sf MS4.t and show that the fmp for the other logics involved can be derived as a consequence of the fullness and faithfulness of the translations considered.
