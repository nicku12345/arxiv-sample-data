Cohesive powers of computable structures are effective analogs of ultrapowers, where cohesive sets play the role of ultrafilters. Let \omega, \zeta, and \eta denote the respective order-types of the natural numbers, the integers, and the rationals when thought of as linear orders. We investigate the cohesive powers of computable linear orders, with special emphasis on computable copies of \omega. If \mathcal{L} is a computable copy of \omega that is computably isomorphic to the standard presentation of \omega, then every cohesive power of \mathcal{L} has order-type \omega + \zeta\eta. However, there are computable copies of \omega, necessarily not computably isomorphic to the standard presentation, having cohesive powers not elementarily equivalent to \omega + \zeta\eta. For example, we show that there is a computable copy of \omega with a cohesive power of order-type \omega + \eta. Our most general result is that if X \subseteq \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\} is either a \Sigma_2 set or a \Pi_2 set, thought of as a set of finite order-types, then there is a computable copy of \omega with a cohesive power of order-type \omega + \sigma(X \cup \{\omega + \zeta\eta + \omega^*\}), where \sigma(X \cup \{\omega + \zeta\eta + \omega^*\}) denotes the shuffle of the order-types in X and the order-type \omega + \zeta\eta + \omega^*. Furthermore, if X is finite and non-empty, then there is a computable copy of \omega with a cohesive power of order-type \omega + \sigma(X).
