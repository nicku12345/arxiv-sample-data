We study the notion of non-trivial elementary embeddings j : V \rightarrow V under the assumption that V satisfies ZFC without Power Set but with the Collection Scheme. We show that no such embedding can exist under the additional assumption that it is cofinal and either V_{\textrm{crit}(j)} is a set or that the Dependent Choice Schemes holds. We then study failures of instances of collection in symmetric submodels of class forcings.
