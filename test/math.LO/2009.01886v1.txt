We prove that any suitable generalization of Laver forcing to the space  \kappa^\kappa, for uncountable regular \kappa, necessarily adds a Cohen \kappa-real. We also study a dichotomy and an ideal naturally related to generalized Laver forcing. Using this dichotomy, we prove the following stronger result: if  \kappa^{<\kappa}=\kappa, then every <\kappa-distributive tree forcing on \kappa^\kappa adding a dominating \kappa-real which is the image of the generic under a continuous function in the ground model, adds a Cohen \kappa-real. This is a contribution to the study of generalized Baire spaces and answers a question from arXiv:1611.08140
