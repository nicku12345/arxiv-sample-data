Continuing the previous paper, we study the Strong Downward L\"owenheim-Skolem Theorems (SDLSs) of the stationary logic and their variations. It has been shown that the SDLS for the ordinary stationary logic with weak second-order parameters down to <\aleph_2 is equivalent to the conjunction of CH and Cox's Diagonal Reflection Principle for internally clubness. We show that the SDLS for the stationary logic without weak second-order parameters down to <2^{\aleph_0} implies that the size of the continuum is \aleph_2. In contrast, an internal interpretation of the stationary logic can satisfy the SDLS down to <2^{\aleph_0} under the continuum being of size >\aleph_2. This SDLS is shown to be equivalent to an internal version of the Diagonal Reflection Principle down to an internally stationary set of size <2^{\aleph_0}. We also consider a {\cal P}_\kappa\lambda version of the stationary logic and show that the SDLS for this logic in internal interpretation for reflection down to <2^{\aleph_0} is consistent under the assumption of the consistency of ZFC + "the existence of a supercompact cardinal" and this SDLS implies that the continuum is (at least) weakly Mahlo. These three "axioms" in terms of SDLS are consequences of three instances of a strengthening of generic supercompactness which we call Laver-generic supercompactness. Existence of a Laver-generic supercompact cardinal in each of these three instances also fixes the cardinality of the continuum to be \aleph_1 or \aleph_2 or very large respectively. We also show that the existence of one of these generic large cardinals implies the "++" version of the corresponding forcing axiom.
