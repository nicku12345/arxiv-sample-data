This paper has two parts. The first is concerned with a variant of a family of games introduced by Holy and Schlicht, that we call \emph{Welch games}. Player II having a winning strategy in the Welch game of length \omega on \kappa is equivalent to weak compactness. Winning the game of length 2^\kappa is equivalent to \kappa being measurable. We show that for games of intermediate length \gamma, II winning implies the existence of precipitous ideals with \gamma-closed, \gamma-dense trees.   The second part shows the first is not vacuous. For each \gamma between \omega and \kappa^+, it gives a model where II wins the games of length \gamma, but not \gamma^+. The technique also gives models where for all \omega_1< \gamma\le\kappa there are \kappa-complete, normal, \kappa^+-distributive ideals having dense sets that are \gamma-closed, but not \gamma^+-closed.
