The methodology used here might provide a neat method of examining paradoxes and ways to circumvent them. Most of the known set theoretic paradoxes (Russell's, Cantor's, Burali-Forti's,..) can be paralleled here and examined. This account will shed the light on a particular application of this method that appears to elude paradoxes; an application that have shortcomings that will be illustrated here and suggestions to solutions are proposed. First I'll present the exposition of the theory, and then speak about its background and the aims behind it and how it can extend our knowledge of overcoming paradoxes.
