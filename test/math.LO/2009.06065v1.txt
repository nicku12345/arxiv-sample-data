For an arbitrary forcing class \Gamma, the \Gamma-fragment of Todorcevic's strong reflection principle SRP is isolated in such a way that (1) the forcing axiom for \Gamma implies the \Gamma-fragment of SRP, (2) the stationary set preserving fragment of SRP is the full principle SRP, and (3) the subcomplete fragment of SRP implies the major consequences of the subcomplete forcing axiom. Along the way, some hitherto unknown effects of (the subcomplete fragment of) SRP on mutual stationarity are explored, and some limitations to the extent to which fragments of SRP may capture the effects of their corresponding forcing axioms are established.
