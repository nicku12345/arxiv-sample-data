We show that after forcing with a countable support iteration or a finite product of Sacks or splitting forcing over L, every analytic hypergraph on a Polish space admits a \mathbf{\Delta}^1_2 maximal independent set. As a main application we get the consistency of \mathfrak{r} = \mathfrak{u} = \mathfrak{i} = \omega_2 together with the existence of a \Delta^1_2 ultrafilter, a \Pi^1_1 maximal independent family and a \Delta^1_2 Hamel basis. This solves open problems of Brendle, Fischer and Khomskii and the author. We also show in ZFC that \mathfrak{d} \leq \mathfrak{i}_{cl}.
