In 2012, the second author introduced and studied the variety \mathcal{I} of implication zroupoids that generalize De Morgan algebras and \lor-semilattices with 0. An algebra \mathbf A = \langle A, \to, 0 \rangle, where \to is binary and 0 is a constant, is called an \emph{implication zroupoid} (\mathcal{I}-zroupoid, for short) if \mathbf A satisfies:   (x \to y) \to z \approx [(z' \to x) \to (y \to z)']', where x' : = x \to 0, and  0'' \approx 0.   Let \mathcal{I} denote the variety of implication zroupoids and \mathbf A \in \mathcal{I}. For x,y \in \mathbf A, let x \land y := (x \to y')' and x \lor y := (x' \land y')'. In an earlier paper we had proved that if \mathbf A \in \mathcal{I}, then the algebra \mathbf A_{mj} = \langle A, \lor, \land \rangle is a bisemigroup. In this paper we generalize the notion of semi-distributivity from lattices to bisemigroups and prove that, for every \mathbf A \in \mathcal{I}, the bisemigroup \mathbf A_{mj} is semidistributive. Secondly, we generalize the Whitman Property from lattices to bisemigroups and prove that the subvariety \mathcal{MEJ} of \mathcal I, defined by the identity: x \land y \approx x \lor y, satisfies the Whitman Property.
