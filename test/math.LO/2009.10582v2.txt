We consider recognizability for Infinite Time Blum-Shub-Smale machines, a model of infinitary computability introduced in Koepke and Seyfferth [KS]. In particular, we show that the lost melody theorem (originally proved for ITTMs in Hamkins and Lewis [HL]), i.e. the existence of non-computable, but recognizable real numbers, holds for ITBMs, that ITBM-recognizable real numbers are hyperarithmetic and that both ITBM-recognizable and ITBM-unrecognizable real numbers appear at every level of the constructible hierarchy below L_{\omega_{1}^{\text{CK}}} at which new real numbers appear at all.
