We introduce a realisability semantics for infinitary intuitionistic set theory that employs Ordinal Turing Machines (OTMs) as realisers. We show that our notion of OTM-realisability is sound with respect to certain systems of infinitary intuitionistic logic, and that all axioms of infinitary Kripke-Platek set theory are realised. As an application of our technique, we show that the propositional admissible rules of (finitary) intuitionistic Kripke-Platek set theory are exactly the admissible rules of intuitionistic propositional logic.
