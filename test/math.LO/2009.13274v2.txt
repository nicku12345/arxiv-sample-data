This document include my comments on Nathan Bowler's proof that every stratified formula is equivalent to an acyclic formula. The whole proof of Nathan's is quoted exactly as it's presented in his messages to me. The comments are edits of clarifying e-mail messages that I have sent to Thomas Forster as well as e-mail correspondence with Nathan Bowler. Minor technical issues are addressed too.
