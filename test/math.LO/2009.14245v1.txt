If \kappa is regular and 2^{<\kappa}\leq\kappa^+, then the existence of a weakly presaturated ideal on \kappa^+ implies \square^*_\kappa. This partially answers a question of Foreman and Magidor about the approachability ideal on \omega_2. As a corollary, we show that if there is a presaturated ideal I on \omega_2 such that \mathcal{P}(\omega_2)/I is semiproper, then CH holds. We also show some barriers to getting the tree property and a saturated ideal simultaneously on a successor cardinal from conventional forcing methods.
