We introduce proper display calculi for basic monotonic modal logic, the conditional logic CK and a number of their axiomatic extensions. These calculi are sound, complete, conservative and enjoy cut elimination and subformula property. Our proposal applies the multi-type methodology in the design of proper display calculi, starting from a semantic analysis which motivates syntactic translations from single-type non-normal modal logics to multi-type normal poly-modal logics.
