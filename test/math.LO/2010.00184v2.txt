The notion of a \textbf{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}-filtered} object, where \mathcal{C} is some (typically small) collection of objects in a Grothendieck category, has become ubiquitous since the solution of the Flat Cover Conjecture around the year 2000. We introduce the \textbf{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}-Filtration Game of length \boldsymbol{\omega_1}} on a module, paying particular attention to the case where \mathcal{C} is the collection of all countably presented, projective modules. We prove that Martin's Maximum implies the determinacy of many \mathcal{C}-Filtration Games of length \omega_1, which in turn imply the determinacy of certain Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'{e} games of length \omega_1; this allows a significant strengthening of a theorem of Mekler-Shelah-Vaananen \cite{MR1191613}. Also, Martin's Maximum implies that if R is a countable hereditary ring, the class of \textbf{\boldsymbol{\sigma}-closed potentially projective modules}---i.e., those modules that are projective in some \sigma-closed forcing extension of the universe---is closed under <\aleph_2-directed limits. We also give an example of a (ZFC-definable) class of abelian groups that, under the ordinary subgroup relation, constitutes an Abstract Elementary Class (AEC) with L\"owenheim-Skolem number \aleph_1 in some models in set theory, but fails to be an AEC in other models of set theory.
