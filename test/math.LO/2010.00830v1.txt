A numbering of a countable family S is a surjective map from the set of natural numbers \omega onto S. The paper studies Rogers semilattices, i.e. upper semilattices induced by the reducibility between numberings, for families S\subset P(\omega). Working in set theory ZF+DC+PD, we obtain the following results on families from various levels of the analytical hierarchy.   For a non-zero number n, by E^1_n we denote \Pi^1_n if n is odd, and \Sigma^1_n if n is even. We show that for a finite family S of E^1_n sets, its Rogers E^1_n-semilattice has the greatest element if and only if S contains the least element under set-theoretic inclusion. Furthermore, if S does not have the \subseteq-least element, then the corresponding Rogers E^1_n-semilattice is upwards dense.
