We study the influence of strong forcing axioms on the complexity of the non-stationary ideal on \omega_2 and its restrictions to certain cofinalities. Our main result shows that the strengthening MM^{++} of Martin's Maximum does not decide whether the restriction of the non-stationary ideal on \omega_2 to sets of ordinals of countable cofinality is \Delta_1-definable by formulas with parameters in H(\omega_3). The techniques developed in the proof of this result also allow us to prove analogous results for the full non-stationary ideal on \omega_2 and strong forcing axioms that are compatible with CH. Finally, we answer a question of S. Friedman, Wu and Zdomskyyshow by showing that the \Delta_1-definability of the non-stationary ideal on \omega_2 is compatible with arbitrary large values of the continuum function at \omega_2.
