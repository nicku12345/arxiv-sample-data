We prove that every abstract elementary class (a.e.c.) with LST number \kappa and vocabulary \tau of cardinality \leq \kappa can be axiomatized in the logic {\mathbb L}_{\beth_2(\kappa)^{+++},\kappa^+}(\tau). In this logic an a.e.c. is therefore an EC class rather than merely a PC class. This constitutes a major improvement on the level of definability previously given by the Presentation Theorem. As part of our proof, we define the \emph{canonical tree} \mathcal S={\mathcal S}_{\mathcal K} of an a.e.c. \mathcal K. This turns out to be an interesting combinatorial object of the class, beyond the aim of our theorem. Furthermore, we study a connection between the sentences defining an a.e.c. and the relatively new infinitary logic L^1_\lambda.}
