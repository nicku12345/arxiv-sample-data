We investigate continuous functions definable in a definably complete uniformly locally o-minimal expansion of the second kind of a densely linearly ordered abelian group (DCULOAS structure).   We prove a variant of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem for uniformly continuous definable functions and the following assertion: Consider the parameterized function f:C \times P \rightarrow M which is equi-continuous with respect to P. The projection image of the set at which f is discontinuous to the parameter space P is of dimension smaller than \dim P when C is closed and bounded.   In addition, we demonstrate that an archimedean DCULOAS structure which enjoys definable Tietze extension property is o-minimal. In the appendix, we show that an o-minimal expansion of an ordered group is not semi-bounded if and only if it enjoys definable Tietze extension property.
