The main goal of this paper is to formulate a constructive analogue of Ackermann's observation about finite set theory and arithmetic. We will see that Heyting arithmetic is bi-interpretable with \mathsf{CZF^{fin}}, the finitary version of \mathsf{CZF}. We also examine bi-interpretability between subtheories of finitary \mathsf{CZF} and Heyting arithmetic based on the modification of Fleischmann's hierarchy of formulas, and the set of hereditarily finite sets over \mathsf{CZF}, which turns out to be a model of \mathsf{CZF^{fin}} but not a model of finitary \mathsf{IZF}.
