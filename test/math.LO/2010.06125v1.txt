We show it is consistent that there is a Souslin tree S such that after forcing with S, S is Kurepa and for all clubs C \subset \omega_1, S\upharpoonright C is rigid. This answers Fuchs's questions in Club degrees of rigidity and almost Kurepa trees. Moreover, we show it is consistent with \diamondsuit that for every Souslin tree there is a dense X \subset S which does not have a copy of S. This is related to a question due to Baumgartner.
