In this Part I, we shall prove the consistency of arithmetic without complete induction from a point of view of strong negation, using its embedding to the tableau system \bf SN of constructive arithmetic with strong negation without complete induction, for which two types of cut elimination theorems hold. One is \bf SN-cut elimination theorem for the full system \bf SN. The other is \bf PCN-cut elimination theorem for a proposed subsystem \bf PCN of \bf SN. The disjunction property and the E-theorem (existence property) for \bf SN are also proved. As a novelty, we shall give a simple proof of a restricted version of \bf SN-cut elimination theorem as an application of the disjunction property, using \bf PCN-cut elimination theorem.
