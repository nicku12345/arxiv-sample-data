We give category-theoretic reformulations of stability, NIP, NTP, and non-dividing by observing that their characterisations in terms of indiscernible sequences are naturally expressed as Quillen lifting properties %(negation) of certain morphisms associated with linear orders, in a certain category extending the categories of topological spaces and of simplicial sets. This suggests an approach to a homotopy theory for model theory.
