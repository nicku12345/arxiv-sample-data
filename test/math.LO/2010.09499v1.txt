We develop a systematic algorithmic framework that unites global and local classification problems for functional separable spaces and apply it to attack classification problems concerning the Banach space C[0,1] of real-valued continuous functions on the unit interval. We prove that the classification problem for continuous (binary) regular functions among almost everywhere linear, pointwise linear-time Lipshitz functions is \Sigma^0_2-complete. We show that a function f\colon [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} is (binary) transducer if and only if it is continuous regular; interestingly, this peculiar and nontrivial fact was overlooked by experts in automata theory. As one of many consequences, our \Sigma^0_2-completeness result covers the class of transducer functions as well. Finally, we show that the Banach space C[0,1] of real-valued continuous functions admits an arithmetical classification among separable Banach spaces. Our proofs combine methods of abstract computability theory, automata theory, and functional analysis.
