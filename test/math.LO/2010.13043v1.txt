In this paper, we investigate properties of countable stationary towers. We derive the regularity properties of sets of reals in L(\mathbf R) from some properties of countable stationary towers without explicit use of strong large cardinals such as Woodin cardinals. We also introduce the notion of semiprecipitousness and investigate its relation to precipitousness and presaturation of countable stationary towers. We show that precipitousness of countable stationary towers of weakly compact height implies the regularity properties of sets of reals in L(\mathbf R).
