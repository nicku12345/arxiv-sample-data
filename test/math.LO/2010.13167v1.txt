We prove that every quasi-Hopfian finitely presented structure A has a d-\Sigma_2 Scott sentence, and that if in addition A is computable and Aut(A) satisfies a natural computable condition, then A has a computable d-\Sigma_2 Scott sentence. This unifies several known results on Scott sentences of finitely presented structures and it is used to prove that other not previously considered algebraic structures of interest have computable d-\Sigma_2 Scott sentences. In particular, we show that every right-angled Coxeter group of finite rank has a computable d-\Sigma_2 Scott sentence, as well as any strongly rigid Coxeter group of finite rank. Finally, we show that the free projective plane of rank 4 has a computable d-\Sigma_2 Scott sentence, thus exhibiting a natural example where the assumption of quasi-Hopfianity is used (since this structure is not Hopfian).
