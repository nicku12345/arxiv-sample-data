We study definable topological dynamics of some algebraic group actions over an arbitrary NIP field K. We show that the Ellis group of the universal definable flow of \mathrm{SL}_2(K) is non-trivial if the multiplicative group of K is not type-definably connected, providing a way to find multiple counterexamples to the Ellis group conjecture, particularly in the case of dp-minimal fields. We also study some structure theory of algebraic groups over K with definable f-generics.
