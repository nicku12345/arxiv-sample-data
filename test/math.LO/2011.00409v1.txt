The Singular Cardinal Hypothesis (SCH) is one of the most classical combinatorial principles in set theory. It says that if \kappa is singular strong limit, then 2^{\kappa}=\kappa^+. We prove that given a singular cardinal \kappa of cofinality \eta in the ground model, which is a limit of suitable large cardinals, there is a forcing extension such that \kappa becomes \aleph_\eta, and SCH fails at \kappa. Our large cardinal assumption is below the existence of a superstrong cardinal. In our model we also obtain a very good scale.
