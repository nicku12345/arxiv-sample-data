It was proved recently that Telg\'arsky's conjecture, which concerns partial information strategies in the Banach-Mazur game, fails in models of \mathsf{GCH}+\square. The proof introduces a combinatorial principle that is shown to follow from \mathsf{GCH}+\square, namely:   \triangledown: Every separative poset \mathbb P with the \kappa-cc contains a dense sub-poset \mathbb D such that |\{ q \in \mathbb D \,:\, p \text{ extends } q \}| < \kappa for every p \in \mathbb P.   We prove this principle is independent of \mathsf{GCH} and \mathsf{CH}, in the sense that \triangledown does not imply \mathsf{CH}, and \mathsf{GCH} does not imply \triangledown assuming the consistency of a huge cardinal.   We also consider the more specific question of whether \triangledown holds with \mathbb P equal to the weight-\aleph_\omega measure algebra. We prove, again assuming the consistency of a huge cardinal, that the answer to this question is independent of \mathsf{ZFC}+\mathsf{GCH}.
