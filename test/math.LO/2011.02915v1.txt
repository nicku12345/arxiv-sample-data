Dag Normann and the author have recently initiated the study of the logical and computational properties of the uncountability of \mathbb{R} formalised as the statement \textsf{NIN} (resp. \textsf{NBI} that there is no injection (resp. bijection) from [0,1] to \mathbb{N}. On one hand, these principles are hard to prove relative to the usual scale based on comprehension and discontinuous functionals. On the other hand, these principles are among the weakest principles on a new complimentary scale based on (classically valid) continuity axioms from Brouwer's intuitionistic mathematics. We continue the study of \textsf{NIN} and \textsf{NBI} relative to the latter scale, connecting these principles with theorems about Baire classes, metric spaces, and unordered sums. The importance of the first two topics requires no explanation, while the final topic's main theorem, i.e. that when they exist, unordered sums are (countable) series, has the rather unique property of implying \textsf{NIN} formulated with the Cauchy criterion, and (only) \textsf{NBI} when formulated with limits. This study is undertaken within Ulrich Kohlenbach's framework of higher-order Reverse Mathematics.
