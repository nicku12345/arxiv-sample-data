We present variants of Goodstein's theorem that are equivalent to arithmetical comprehension and to arithmetical transfinite recursion, respectively, over a weak base theory. These variants differ from the usual Goodstein theorem in that they (necessarily) entail the existence of complex infinite objects. As part of our proof, we show that the Veblen hierarchy of normal functions on the ordinals is closely related to an extension of the Ackermann function by direct limits.
