Every countable structure has a sentence of the infinitary logic \mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega} which characterizes that structure up to isomorphism among countable structures. Such a sentence is called a Scott sentence, and can be thought of as a description of the structure. The least complexity of a Scott sentence for a structure can be thought of as a measurement of the complexity of describing the structure. We begin with an introduction to the area, with short and simple proofs where possible, followed by a survey of recent advances.
