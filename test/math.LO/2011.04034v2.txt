We define the new notion of a  \mu-uniformly-counter-collapsed structure using which we introduce a theory  \mathbb{T}_\mu  serving as the first example of a strictly  \text{NSOP}_3  theory. This answers a question posed in [DS04] and reappeared in [SU08] and [MS16]. The existence of such a theory provides a better understanding of the hierarchy of unstable theories without the strict order property.
