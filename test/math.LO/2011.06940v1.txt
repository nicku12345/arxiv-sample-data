Cie\'sli\'nski asked whether compositional truth theory with the additional axiom that all propositional tautologies are true is conservative over Peano Arithmetic. We provide a partial answer to this question, showing that if we additionally assume that truth predicate agrees with arithmetical truth on quantifier-free sentences, the resulting theory is as strong as \Delta_0-induction for the compositional truth predicate, hence non-conservative. On the other hand, it can be shown with a routine argument that the principle of quantifier-free correctness is itself conservative.
