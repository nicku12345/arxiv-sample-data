In this note we show first that the first-order logic IK^\omega is sound with regard to the models obtained continuum-valued \L{}ukasiewicz-models for first-order languages by treating the quantifiers as infinitary strong disjunction/conjunction rather than infinitary weak disjunction/conjunction. We then proceed to show that these models cannot be used to provide a new consistency proof for the theory of truth IKT^\omega obtained by expanding IK^\omega with transparent truth since the models are incompatible with transparent truth. Moreover, we also show that whether or not this inconsistency can be reproduced in the sequent calculus for IKT^\omega depends on how vacuous quantification is treated.
