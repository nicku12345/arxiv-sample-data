A first-order structure \mathfrak{A} is called monadically stable iff every expansion of \mathfrak{A} by unary predicates is stable. In this article we give a classification of the class \mathcal{M} of \omega-categorical monadically stable structures in terms of their automorphism groups. We prove in turn that \mathcal{M} is smallest class of structures which contains the one-element pure set, closed under isomorphisms, and closed under taking finitely disjoint unions, infinite copies, and finite index first-order reducts. Using our classification we show that every structure in \mathcal{M} is first-order interdefinable with a finitely bounded homogeneous structure. We also prove that every structure in \mathcal{M} has finitely many reducts up to interdefinability, thereby confirming Thomas' conjecture for the class \mathcal{M}.
