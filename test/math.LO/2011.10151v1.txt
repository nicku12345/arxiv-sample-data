Despite being fairly powerful, finite non-deterministic matrices are unable to characterize some logics of formal inconsistency, such as those found between mbCcl and Cila. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose here restricted non-deterministic matrices (in short, RNmatrices), which are non-deterministic algebras together with a subset of the set of valuations closed under substitutions. This allows to characterize not only mbCcl and Cila (which is equivalent, up to language, to da Costa's logic C1 ) but the whole hierarchy of da Costa's calculi Cn. This produces a novel and simple decision procedure for these logics. Finally, we generalize these finite RNmatrices to others based on arbitrary Boolean algebras, through the notion of restricted swap structures.
