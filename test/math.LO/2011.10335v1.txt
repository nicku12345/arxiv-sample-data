Suppose that \widetilde{\mathbb R} is an o-minimal expansion of the real field in which restricted power functions are definable. We show that if \widehat{\mathbb R} is both a reduct (in the sense of definability) of the expansion \widetilde{\mathbb R}^{\mathbb R} of \widetilde{\mathbb R} by all real power functions and an expansion (again in the sense of definability) of \widetilde{\mathbb R}, then, provided that \widetilde{\mathbb R} and \widehat{\mathbb R} have the same field of exponents, they define the same sets. This can be viewed as a polynomially bounded version of an old conjecture of van den Dries and Miller.
