This paper introduces two sequent calculi for intuitionistic strong L\"ob logic {\sf iSL}_\Box: a terminating sequent calculus {\sf G4iSL}_\Box based on the terminating sequent calculus {\sf G4ip} for intuitionistic propositional logic {\sf IPC} and an extension {\sf G3iSL}_\Box of the standard cut-free sequent calculus {\sf G3ip} without structural rules for {\sf IPC}. One of the main results is a syntactic proof of the cut-elimination theorem for {\sf G3iSL}_\Box. In addition, equivalences between the sequent calculi and Hilbert systems for {\sf iSL}_\Box are established. It is known from the literature that {\sf iSL}_\Box is complete with respect to the class of intuitionistic modal Kripke models in which the modal relation is transitive, conversely well-founded and a subset of the intuitionistic relation. Here a constructive proof of this fact is obtained by using a countermodel construction based on a variant of {\sf G4iSL}_\Box. The paper thus contains two proofs of cut-elimination, a semantic and a syntactic proof.
