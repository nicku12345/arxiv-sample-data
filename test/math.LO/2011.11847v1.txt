This paper provides a method to obtain terminating analytic calculi for a large class of intuitionistic modal logics. For a given logic L with a cut-free calculus G that is an extension of G3ip the method produces a terminating analytic calculus that is an extension of G4ip and equivalent to G. G4ip has been introduced by Dyckhoff in 1992 as a terminating analogue of the calculus G3ip for intuitionistic propositional logic. Thus this paper can be viewed as an extension of Dyckhoff's work to intuitionistic modal logic.
