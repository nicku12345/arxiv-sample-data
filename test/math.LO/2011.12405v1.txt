Fix an abelian group \Gamma and an injective endomorphism F \colon \Gamma \to \Gamma. Improving on the results of Bell and Moosa, new characterizations are here obtained for the existence of spanning sets, F-automaticity, and F-sparsity. The model theoretic status of these sets is also investigated, culminating with a combinatorial description of the F-sparse sets that are stable in (\Gamma, +), and a proof that the expansion of (\Gamma, +) by any F-sparse set is NIP. These methods are also used to show for prime p\ge 7 that the expansion of (\mathbb{F}_p[t], +) by multiplication restricted to t^\mathbb{N} is NIP.
