Cousin's lemma is a compactness principle that naturally arises when studying the gauge integral, a generalisation of the Lebesgue integral. We study the axiomatic strength of Cousin's lemma for various classes of functions, using Friedman and Simpson's reverse mathematics in second-order arithmetic. We prove that, over \mathsf{RCA}_0:   (i) Cousin's lemma for continuous functions is equivalent to the system \mathsf{WKL}_0;   (ii) Cousin's lemma for Baire 1 functions is at least as strong as \mathsf{ACA}_0;   (iii) Cousin's lemma for Baire 2 functions is at least as strong as \mathsf{ATR}_0.
