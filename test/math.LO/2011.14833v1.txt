We initiate an investigation of structures on the set of real numbers having the property that path components of definable sets are definable. All o\nobreakdash-\hspace{0pt}minimal structures on (\mathbb{R},<) have the property, as do all expansions of (\mathbb{R},+,\cdot,\mathbb{N}). Our main analytic-geometric result is that any such expansion of (\mathbb{R},<,+) by boolean combinations of open sets (of any arities) either is o\nobreakdash-\hspace{0pt}minimal or defines an isomorph of (\mathbb N,+,\cdot\,). We also show that any given expansion of (\mathbb{R}, <, +,\mathbb{N}) by subsets of \mathbb{N}^n (n allowed to vary) has the property if and only if it defines all arithmetic sets. Variations arise by considering connected components or quasicomponents instead of path components.
