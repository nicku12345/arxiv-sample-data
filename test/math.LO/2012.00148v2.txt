Contact algebra is one of the main tools in region-based theory of space. In \cite{dmvw1, dmvw2,iv,i1} it is generalized by dropping the operation Boolean complement. Furthermore we can generalize contact algebra by dropping also the operation meet. Thus we obtain structures, called contact join-semilattices (CJS) and structures, called distributive contact join-semilattices (DCJS). We obtain a set-theoretical representation theorem for CJS and a relational representation theorem for DCJS. As corollaries we get also topological representation theorems. We prove that the universal theory of CJS and of DCJS is the same and is decidable.
