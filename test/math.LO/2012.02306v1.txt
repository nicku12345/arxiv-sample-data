We prove that every \textsf{MAD }family can be destroyed by a proper forcing that preserves P-points. With this result, we prove that it is consistent that \omega_{1}=\mathfrak{u}<\mathfrak{a,} solving a nearly 20 year old problem of Shelah and a problem of Brendle. We will also present a simple proof of a result of Blass and Shelah that the inequality \mathfrak{u<s} is consistent.
