Let M be a tame mouse modelling ZFC. We show that M satisfies ``there is a real x such that every set is OD in x'', and that the restriction of the extender sequence of M to the interval [\omega_1^M,\infty) is definable without parameters over the universe of M. We show that M has universe H[X], where H=\mathrm{HOD}^M and X=M|\omega_1^M is the initial segment of M of height \omega_1^M (including the restriction of M's extender sequence through \omega_1^M), and that H is the universe of a premouse over some t\subseteq\omega_2^M. We also show that M has no proper grounds via strategically \sigma-closed forcings.   We then extend some of these results partially to non-tame mice, including a proof that many natural \varphi-minimal mice model ``V=\mathrm{HOD}'', assuming a certain fine structural hypothesis whose proof has almost been given elsewhere.
