Measuring says that for every sequence (C_\delta)_{\delta<\omega_1} with each C_\delta being a closed subset of \delta there is a club C\subseteq\omega_1 such that for every \delta\in C, a tail of C\cap\delta is either contained in or disjoint from C_\delta. In our JSL paper "Measuring club-sequences together with the continuum large" we claimed to prove the consistency of Measuring with 2^{\aleph_0} being arbitrarily large, thereby answering a question of Justin Moore. The proof in that paper was flawed. In the presented corrigendum we provide a correct proof of that result. The construction works over any model of ZFC+CH and can be described as the result of performing a finite-support forcing construction with side conditions consisting of suitable symmetric systems of models with markers.
