We consider how changes in transfinite machine architecture can sometimes alter substantially their capabilities. We approach the subject by answering three open problems touching on: firstly differing halting time considerations for machines with multiple as opposed to single heads, secondly space requirements, and lastly limit rules. We: 1) use admissibility theory, \Sigma_{2}-codes and \Pi_{3}-reflection properties in the constructible hierarchy to classify the halting times of ITTMs with multiple independent heads; the same for Ordinal Turing Machines which have \tmop{On} length tapes; 2) determine which admissible lengths of tapes for transfinite time machines with long tapes allow the machine to address each of their cells - a question raised by B. Rin; 3) characterise exactly the strength and behaviour of transfinitely acting Blum-Shub-Smale machines using a \tmop{Liminf} rule on their registers - thereby establishing there is a universal such machine. This is in contradistinction to the machine using a `continuity' rule which fails to be universal.
