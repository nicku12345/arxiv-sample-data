Bilattices, which provide an algebraic tool for simultaneously modelling knowledge and truth, were introduced by N.D. Belnap in a 1977 paper entitled 'How a computer should think'. Prioritised default bilattices include not only Belnap's four values, for `true' (t), `false'(f), `contradiction' (\top) and `no information' (\bot), but also indexed families of default values for simultaneously modelling degrees of knowledge and truth. Prioritised default bilattices have applications in a number of areas including artificial intelligence.   In our companion paper, we introduced a new family of prioritised default bilattices, \mathbf J_n, for n \in \omega, with \mathbf J_0 being Belnap's seminal example. We gave a duality for the variety \mathcal V_n generated by \mathbf J_n, with the objects of the dual category \mathcal X_n being multi-sorted topological structures.   Here we study the dual category in depth. We give an axiomatisation of the category \mathcal X_n and show that it is isomorphic to a category \mathcal Y_n of single-sorted topological structures. The objects of \mathcal Y_n are Priestley spaces endowed with a continuous retraction in which the order has a natural ranking. We show how to construct the Priestley dual of the underlying bounded distributive lattice of an algebra in \mathcal V_n via its dual in \mathcal Y_n; as an application we show that the size of the free algebra \mathbf F_{\mathcal V_n}(1) is given by a polynomial in n of degree 6.
