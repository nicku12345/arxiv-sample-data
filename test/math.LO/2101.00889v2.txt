Let M be a \lambda-indexed (that is, Jensen indexed) premouse. We prove that M is iterable with respect to standard \lambda-iteration rules iff M is iterable with respect to a natural version of Mitchell-Steel iteration rules. Using this equivalence, we describe a background construction for \lambda-indexed mice, analogous to traditional background constructions for Mitchell-Steel indexed mice, and which absorbs Woodin cardinals from the background universe.   We also prove some facts regarding the correspondence between standard iteration trees and u-iteration trees on premice with Mitchell-Steel indexing.
