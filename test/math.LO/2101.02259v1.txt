In the first part of this paper we analyzed finite non-deterministic matrix semantics for propositional non-normal modal logics as an alternative to the standard Kripke's possible world semantics. This kind of modal systems characterized by finite non-deterministic matrices was originally proposed by Ju. Ivlev in the 70's. The aim of this second paper is to introduce a formal non-deterministic semantical framework for the quantified versions of some Ivlev-like non-normal modal logics. It will be shown that several well-known controversial issues of quantified modal logics, relative to the identity predicate, Barcan's formulas, and de dicto and de re modalities, can be tackled from a new angle within the present framework.
