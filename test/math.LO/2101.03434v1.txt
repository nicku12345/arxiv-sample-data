I prove several independence results in the choiceless ZF+DC theory which separate algebraic and non-algebraic consequences of the axiom of choice. As an example, let E be an equivalence relation resulting from a turbulent Polish group action, let X be a Polish field, and let F be a countable subfield. It is consistent with the choiceless theory ZF+DC that X has a transcendence basis over F and E does not have a selector.
