A translation from Spanish into French of a paper by N. Cuesta published in 1954. The paper deals mainly with partially, and totally, ordered sets. Two subjects are specially dealt with: Construction of new ordered sets starting from a family of those. Completion of ordered sets by tools akin to Dedekind cuts. Curiously enough, the so-called surreal numbers (later defined by Conway, in 1974) are already there, thirty years before.
