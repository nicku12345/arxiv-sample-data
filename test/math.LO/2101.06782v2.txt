We state conditions for which a definable local homomorphism between two locally definable groups \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{G^{\prime}} can be uniquely extended when \mathcal{G} is simply connected (Theorem 2.1). As an application of this result we obtain an easy proof of [3, Thm. 9.1] (see Corollary 2.2). We also prove that Theorem 10.2 in [3] also holds for any definably connected definably compact semialgebraic group G not necessarily abelian over a sufficiently saturated real closed field R; namely, that the o-minimal universal covering group \widetilde{G} of G is an open locally definable subgroup of \widetilde{H\left(R\right)^{0}} for some R-algebraic group H (Thm. 3.3). Finally, for an abelian definably connected semialgebraic group G over R, we describe \widetilde{G} as a locally definable extension of subgroups of the o-minimal universal covering groups of commutative R-algebraic groups (Theorem 3.4)
