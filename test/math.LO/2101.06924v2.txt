Let n\in\omega. The weak choice principle \operatorname{RC}_n states that for every infinite set x there is an infinite subset y\subseteq x with a choice function on [y]^n:=\{z\subseteq y\mid \lvert z\rvert =n\}. \operatorname{C}_n^- states that for every infinite family of n-element sets, there is an infinite subfamily \mathcal{G}\subseteq\mathcal{F} with a choice function. \operatorname{LOC}_n^- and \operatorname{WOC}_n^- are the same statement but we assume that the family \mathcal{F} is linearly orderable (\operatorname{LOC}_n^-) or well-orderable (\operatorname{WOC}_n^-).   In the first part of this paper we will give a full characterization of when the implication \operatorname{RC}_m\Rightarrow \operatorname{WOC}_n^- with m,n\in\omega holds in \operatorname{ZF}. We will prove the independence results by using suitable Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation models. In the second part of we will show some generalizations. In particular we will show that \operatorname{RC}_5\Rightarrow \operatorname{LOC}_5^- and \operatorname{RC}_6\Rightarrow \operatorname{C}_3^-, answering two open questions from Halbeisen and Tachtsis. Furthermore we will show that \operatorname{RC}_6\Rightarrow \operatorname{C}_9^- and \operatorname{RC}_7\Rightarrow \operatorname{LOC}_7^-.
