We investigate the lower bound of the consistency strength of \mathsf{CZF} with Full Separation \mathsf{Sep} and a Reinhardt set, a constructive analogue of Reinhardt cardinals. We show that \mathsf{CZF+Sep} with a Reinhardt set interprets \mathsf{ZF^-} with a cofinal elementary embedding j:V\prec V. We also see that \mathsf{CZF+Sep} with a Reinhardt set interprets \mathsf{ZF^-} with a model of \mathsf{ZF+WA_0}, the Wholeness axiom for bounded formulas.
