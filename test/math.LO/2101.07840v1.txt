For every natural number n we introduce a new weak choice principle \mathrm{nRC_{fin}}: Given any infinite set x, there is an infinite subset y\subseteq x and a selection function f that chooses an n-element subset from every finite z\subseteq y containing at least n elements. By constructing new permutation models built on a set of atoms obtained as Fra\"iss\'e limits, we will study the relation of \mathrm{nRC_{fin}} to the weak choice principles \mathrm{RC_m} (that has already been studied by Montenegro, Halbeisen and Tachtsis): Given any infinite set x, there is an infinite subset y\subseteq x with a choice function f on the family of all m-element subsets of y. Moreover, we prove a stronger analogue of Montenegros results when we study the relation between \mathrm{nRC_{fin}} and \mathrm{kC_{fin}^-} which is defined by: Given any infinite family \mathcal{F} of finite sets of cardinality greater than k, there is an infinite subfamily \mathcal{A}\subseteq \mathcal{F} with a selection function f that chooses a k-element subset from each A\in\mathcal{A}.
