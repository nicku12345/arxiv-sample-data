The Posner-Robinson Theorem states that for any reals Z and A such that Z \oplus 0' \leq_\mathrm{T} A and 0 <_\mathrm{T} Z, there exists B such that A \equiv_\mathrm{T} B' \equiv_\mathrm{T} B \oplus Z \equiv_\mathrm{T} B \oplus 0'. Consequently, any nonzero Turing degree \operatorname{deg}_\mathrm{T}(Z) is a Turing jump relative to some B. Here we prove the hyperarithmetical analog, based on an unpublished proof of Slaman, namely that for any reals Z and A such that Z \oplus \mathcal{O} \leq_\mathrm{T} A and 0 <_\mathrm{HYP} Z, there exists B such that A \equiv_\mathrm{T} \mathcal{O}^B \equiv_\mathrm{T} B \oplus Z \equiv_\mathrm{T} B \oplus \mathcal{O}. As an analogous consequence, any nonhyperarithmetical Turing degree \operatorname{deg}_\mathrm{T}(Z) is a hyperjump relative to some B.
