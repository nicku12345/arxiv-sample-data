The {\em tetravalent modal logic} (\cal TML) is one of the two logics defined by Font and Rius (\cite{FR2}) (the other is the {\em normal tetravalent modal logic} {\cal TML}^N) in connection with Monteiro's tetravalent modal algebras. These logics are expansions of the well--known {\em Belnap--Dunn's four--valued logic} that combine a many-valued character (tetravalence) with a modal character. In fact, \cal TML is the logic that preserve degrees of truth with respect to tetravalent modal algebras. As Font and Rius observed, the connection between the logic \cal TML and the algebras is not so good as in {\cal TML}^N, but, as a compensation, it has a better proof-theoretic behavior, since it has a strongly adequate Gentzen calculus (see \cite{FR2}). In this work, we prove that the sequent calculus given by Font and Rius does not enjoy the cut--elimination property. Then, using a general method proposed by Avron, Ben-Naim and Konikowska (\cite{Avron02}), we provide a sequent calculus for \cal TML with the cut--elimination property. Finally, inspired by the latter, we present a {\em natural deduction} system, sound and complete with respect to the tetravalent modal logic.
