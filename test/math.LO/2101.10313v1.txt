The minimum classical extension S^{+g} of a constructive theory S based on intuitionistic logic is defined by adding to S the G\"odel negative interpretations of its classically correct mathematical axioms. First and second order (primitive recursive) intuitionistic arithmetic are their own minimum classical extensions, but intuitionistic recursive analysis cannot even prove the negative interpretation of its quantifier-free countable choice axiom. Variants of Kuroda's double negation shift schema (including the G\"odel-Dyson-Kreisel axiom equivalent to the weak completeness of intuitionistic predicate logic) and weak comprehension principles provide neat characterizations of the minimum classical extensions of many classically correct subsystems of Kleene's intuitionistic analysis I which are of interest to constructive mathematicians. Some questions are left open.
