We introduce trace definability, a weak notion of interpretability, and trace equivalence, a weak notion of equivalence for first order structures and theories. In particular we get an interesting weak equivalence notion for \mathrm{NIP} theories. We describe a close connection to indiscernible collapse. We also show that if Q is a divisible subgroup of (\mathbb{R};+) and \mathcal{Q} is a dp-rank one expansion of (Q;+,<) then exactly one of the following holds: \mathrm{Th}(\mathcal{Q}) trace defines \mathrm{RCF} or \mathcal{Q} is trace equivalent to a reduct of an ordered vector space.
