Shelah showed that the existence of free subsets over internally approachable subalgebras follows from the failure of the PCF conjecture on intervals of regular cardinals. We show that a stronger property called the Approachable Bounded Subset Property can be forced from the assumption of a cardinal \lambda for which the set of Mitchell orders \{ o(\mu) \mid \mu < \lambda\} is unbounded in \lambda.   Furthermore, we study the related notion of continuous tree-like scales, and show that such scales must exist on all products in canonical inner models. We use this result, together with a covering-type argument, to show that the large cardinal hypothesis from the forcing part is optimal.
