In \cite{MacResField} the second author gave a systematic analysis of definability and decidability for rings \mathcal M/p\mathcal M, where \mathcal M is a model of Peano Arithmetic and p is a prime in \mathcal M. In the present paper we extend those results to the more difficult case of \mathcal M/p^k\mathcal M, where \mathcal M is a model of Peano Arithmetic, p is a prime in \mathcal M, and k>1. In \cite{MacResField} work of Ax on finite fields was used, here we use in addition work of Ax on ultraproduct of p-adics.
