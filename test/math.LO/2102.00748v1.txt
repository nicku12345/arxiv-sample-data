Let M denote the Merimovich's model in which for each infinite cardinal \lambda, 2^\lambda=\lambda^{+3}. We show that in M the following hold:   (1) Shelah's strong hypothesis fails at all singular cardinals, indeed, \forall \lambda (\lambda is a singular cardinal \Rightarrow pp(\lambda)=\lambda^{+3}).   (2) For each singular cardinal \lambda there is an inner model N of M such that M and N have the same bounded subsets of \lambda, \lambda is a singular cardinal in N, (\lambda^{+i})^N=(\lambda^{+i})^M, for i=1,2,3, and N \models 2^\lambda=\lambda^{+}. Thus it is possible to add many new fresh subsets to \lambda without adding any new bounded subsets to \lambda.
