Let \mathcal M=\langle K;O\rangle be a real closed valued field and let k be its residue field. We prove that every interpretable field in \mathcal M is definably isomorphic to either K, K(\sqrt{-1}), k, or k(\sqrt{-1}). The same result holds when K is a model of T, for T an o-minimal expansion of a real closed field, and O is a T-convex subring.   The proof is direct and does not make use of known results about elimination of imaginaries in valued fields.
