We introduce and develop a topological semantics of conservativity logics and interpretability logics. We prove the topological compactness theorem of consistent normal extensions of the conservativity logic \mathbf{CL} by extending Shehtman's ultrabouquet construction method to our framework. As a consequence, we prove that several extensions of \mathbf{CL} such as \mathbf{IL}, \mathbf{ILM}, \mathbf{ILP} and \mathbf{ILW} are strongly complete with respect to our topological semantics.
