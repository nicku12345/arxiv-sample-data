We describe the extension of normal iteration strategies with appropriate condensation properties to strategies for stacks of normal trees, with full normalization. Given a regular uncountable cardinal \Omega and an (m,\Omega+1)-iteration strategy \Sigma for a premouse M such that \Sigma and M both have appropriate condensation properties, we extend \Sigma to a strategy \Sigma^* for the (m,\Omega,\Omega+1)^*-iteration game such that for all \lambda<\Omega and all stacks \vec{\mathcal{T}}=\left<\mathcal{T}_\alpha\right>_{\alpha<\lambda} via \Sigma^*, consisting of normal trees \mathcal{T}_\alpha, each of length {<\Omega}, there is a corresponding normal tree \mathcal{X} via \Sigma with M^{\vec{\mathcal{T}}}_\infty=M^{\mathcal{X}}_\infty, along with agreement of iteration maps when there are no drops in model or degree on main branches. We also use the methods to analyze the comparison of multiple iterates via such a common strategy.
