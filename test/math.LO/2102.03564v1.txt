The Baire algebra of a topological space X is the quotient of the algebra of all subsets of X modulo the meager sets. We show that this Boolean algebra can be endowed with a natural closure operator satisfying the standard properties of the topological one, resulting in a closure algebra which we denote {\bf Baire}(X). We identify the modal logic of such algebras to be the well-known system \sf S5, and prove soundness and strong completeness for the cases where X is crowded and either completely metrizable and continuum-sized or locally compact Hausdorff. We also show that every extension of \sf S5 is the modal logic of a subalgebra of {\bf Baire}(X), and that soundness and strong completeness also holds in the language with the universal modality.
