We present three classes of abstract prearithmetics, \{\mathbf{A}_M\}_{M \geq 1}, \{\mathbf{A}_{-M,M}\}_{M \geq 1}, and \{\mathbf{B}_M\}_{M \geq 0}. The first one is weakly projective with respect to the conventional nonnegative real Diophantine arithmetic \mathbf{R_+}=(\mathbb{R}_+,+,\times,\leq_{\mathbb{R}_+}), while the other two are weakly projective with respect to the conventional real Diophantine arithmetic \mathbf{R}=(\mathbb{R},+,\times,\leq_{\mathbb{R}}). In addition, we have that every \mathbf{A}_M and every \mathbf{B}_M are a complete totally ordered semiring, while every \mathbf{A}_{-M,M} is not. We show that the weak projection of any series in \mathbf{R_+} converges in \mathbf{A}_M, for any M \geq 1, and that the weak projection of any non-oscillating series in \mathbf{R} converges in \mathbf{A}_{-M,M}, for any M \geq 1, and in \mathbf{B}_M, for all M \in \mathbb{R}_+. We also prove that working in \mathbf{A}_M and in \mathbf{A}_{-M,M}, for any M \geq 1, allows to overcome a version of the paradox of the heap, while working in \mathbf{B}_M does not.
