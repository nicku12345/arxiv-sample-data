It is well-known fact that there exists 1-1 correspondence between so-called double (or flou) sets and intuitionistic sets (also known as orthopairs). At first glance, these two concepts seem to be irreconcilable. However, one must remember that algebraic operations in these two classes are also defined differently. Hence, the expected compatibility is possible. Contrary to this approach, we combine standard definition of double set with operations which are typical for intuitionistic sets. We show certain advantages and limitations of this viewpoint. Moreover, we suggest an interpretation of our sets and operations in terms of logic, data clustering and multi-criteria decision making. As a result, we obtain a structure of discussion between several participants who propose their "necessary" and "allowable" requirements or propositions.
