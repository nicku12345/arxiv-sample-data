We apply the technology developed in the 80s by Avraham, Rubin, and Shelah, to prove that the following is consistent with ZFC: there exists an uncountable, separable metric space X with rational distances, such that every uncountable partial 1-1 function from X to X is an isometry on an uncountable subset. This space contains a dense copy of the rational Urysohn space, and is homogeneous with respect to finite subspaces. We prove similar results for some other classes of structures, and in some cases show that the models we obtain are, in some sense, canonical.
