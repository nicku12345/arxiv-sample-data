In this paper, we propose a generalization of Continuous Logic ([BBHU08]) where the distances take values in suitable co-quantales (in the way as it was proposed in [Fla97]). By assuming suitable conditions (e.g., being co-divisible, co-Girard and a V-domain), we provide, as test questions, a proof of a version of the Tarski-Vaught test (Proposition 3.35) and Los Theorem (Theorem 3.62) in our setting.
