The Jump Inversion Theorem says that for every real A \ge_T 0' there is a real B such that A \equiv_T B' \equiv_T B \oplus 0'. A known refinement of this theorem says that we can choose B to be a member of any special \Pi^0_1 subclass of \{0,1\}^\omega. We now consider the possibility of analogous refinements of two other well-known theorems: the Join Theorem -- for all reals A and Z such that A \ge_T Z \oplus 0' and Z >_T 0, there is a real B such that A \equiv_T B' \equiv_T B \oplus 0' \equiv_T B \oplus Z -- and the Pseudojump Inversion Theorem -- for all reals A \ge_T 0' and every e \in \omega, there is a real B such that A \equiv_T B \oplus W_e^B \equiv_T B \oplus 0'. We show that in these theorems, B can be found in some special \Pi^0_1 subclasses of \{0,1\}^\omega but not in others.
