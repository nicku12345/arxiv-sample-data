Given a subset of X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n} we can associate with every point x\in \mathbb{R}^{n} a vector space V of maximal dimension with the property that for some ball centered at x, the subset X coincides inside the ball with a union of hyperplanes parallel with V. A point is singular if V has dimension 0. In an earlier paper we proved that a (\mathbb{R}, +,< ,\mathbb{Z})-definable relation X is actually definable in (\mathbb{R}, +,< ,1) if and only if the number of singular points is finite and every rational section of X is (\mathbb{R}, +,< ,1)-definable, where a rational section is a set obtained from X by fixing some component to a rational value. Here we show that we can dispense with the hypothesis of X being (\mathbb{R}, +,< ,\mathbb{Z})-definable by assuming that the components of the singular points are rational numbers. This provides a topological characterization of first-order definability in the structure (\mathbb{R}, +,< ,1).
