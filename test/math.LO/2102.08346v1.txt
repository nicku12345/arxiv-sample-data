The Hilbert program was actually a specific approach for proving consistency. Quantifiers were supposed to be replaced by \epsilon-terms. \epsilon{x}A(x) was supposed to denote a witness to \exists{x}A(x), arbitrary if there is none. The Hilbertians claimed that in any proof in a number-theoretic system S, each \epsilon-term can be replaced by a numeral, making each line provable and true. This implies that S must not only be consistent, but also 1-consistent (\Sigma_{1}^{0}-correct). Here we show that if the result is supposed to be provable within S, a statement about all \Pi_{2}^{0} statements that subsumes itself within its own scope must be provable, yielding a contradiction. The result resembles G\"odel's but arises naturally out of the Hilbert program itself.
