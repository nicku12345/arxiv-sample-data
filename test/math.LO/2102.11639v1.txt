We prove undecidability and pinpoint the place in the arithmetical hierarchy for commutative action logic, that is, the equational theory of commutative residuated Kleene lattices (action lattices), and infinitary commutative action logic, the equational theory of *-continuous action lattices. Namely, we prove that the former is \Sigma_1^0-complete and the latter is \Pi_1^0-complete. Thus, the situation is the same as in the more well-studied non-commutative case. The methods used, however, are different: we encode infinite and circular computations of counter (Minsky) machines.
