We introduce the family of axioms \operatorname{Slice}_\kappa, which claim existence of non-trivial decompositions of the form \{2^{<\kappa} \cap V_\alpha |\; \alpha<\kappa\}, for sets 2^{<\kappa}, where \{V_\alpha|\; \alpha<\kappa \} is a sequence of transitive models of set theory. We study compatibility of these axioms with versions of Martin's Axiom, and in particular show that \operatorname{Slice}_{\omega_1} is consistent only with some very weak form of MA.
