Vardanyan's Theorem states that quantified provability logic is \Pi^0_2-complete, and in particular impossible to recursively axiomatize for consistent theories containing a minimum of arithmetic. However, the proof of this fact cannot be performed in a strictly positive signature. The logic QRC_1 was previously introduced as a candidate first-order provability logic. Here we show that QRC_1 is indeed complete with respect to arithmetical semantics. This is achieved via a Solovay-type construction applied to constant domain Kripke models. As a corollary we conclude that QRC_1 is also the quantified provability logic of HA.
