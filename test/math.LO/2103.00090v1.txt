Two types of approximation to the paradoxical Russell Set are presented, one approximating it from below, one from above. It is shown that any lower approximation gives rise to a better approximation containing it, and that any upper approximation contains a distinct better approximation. The Russell Paradox is then seen to be the claim that two of these processes of better approximations stop, and at the same set. I claim that this shows the unrestricted Axiom of Comprehension to be, not a coherent intuition worthy of rescue from a mysterious paradox, but simply wishful thinking.
