The class of linearly ordered sets with one order preserving unary operation has the Strong Amalgamation Property (SAP). The class of linearly ordered sets with one strict order preserving unary operation has AP but not SAP. The class of linearly ordered sets with two order preserving unary operations has not AP. For every set F, the class of linearly ordered sets with an F-indexed family of automorphisms has SAP. Corresponding results are proved in the case of order reversing operations. Various subclasses of the above classes are considered and some model-theoretical consequences are presented.
