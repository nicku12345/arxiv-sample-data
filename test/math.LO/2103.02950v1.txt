Louveau showed that if a Borel set in a Polish space happens to be in a Borel Wadge class \Gamma, then its \Gamma-code can be obtained from its Borel code in a hyperarithmetical manner. We extend Louveau's theorem to Borel functions: If a Borel function on a Polish space happens to be a \Sigma_t-function, then one can effectively find its \Sigma_t-code hyperarithmetically relative to its Borel code. More generally, we prove extension-type, domination-type, and decomposition-type variants of Louveau's theorem for Borel functions.
