We show that every definable subset of an uncountably categorical pseudofinite structure has pseudofinite cardinality which is polynomial (over the rationals) in the size of any strongly minimal subset, with the degree of the polynomial equal to the Morley rank of the subset. From this fact, we show that classes of finite structures whose ultraproducts all satisfy the same uncountably categorical theory are polynomial R-mecs as well as N-dimensional asymptotic classes, where N is the Morley rank of the theory.
