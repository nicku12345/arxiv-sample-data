For \mu, \kappa infinite, say \mathcal{A}\subseteq [\kappa]^\kappa is a (\mu,\kappa)-maximal independent family if whenever \mathcal{A}_0 and \mathcal{A}_1 are pairwise disjoint non-empty in [\mathcal{A}]^{<\mu} then \bigcap\mathcal{A}_0\backslash\bigcup\mathcal{A}_1 \not= \emptyset, \mathcal{A} is maximal under inclusion among families with this property, and moreover all such Booelan combinations have size \kappa. We denote by \mathfrak{sp}_{\mathfrak i}(\mu,\kappa) the set of all cardinalities of such families, and if non-empty, we let \mathfrak{i}_\mu(\kappa) be its minimal element. Thus, \mathfrak{i}_\mu(\kappa) (if defined) is a natural higher analogue of the independence number on \omega for the higher Baire spaces. In this paper, we study \mathfrak{sp}_{\mathfrak i}(\mu,\kappa) for \mu,\kappa uncountable. Among others, we show that:   (1) The property \mathfrak{sp}_{\mathfrak i}(\mu,\kappa)\neq\emptyset cannot be decided on the basis of ZFC plus large cardinals.   (2) Relative to a measurable, it is consistent that: (a) (\exists \kappa{>}\omega) \, \mathfrak{i}_{\kappa}(\kappa)<2^\kappa; (b) (\exists \kappa{>}\omega)\,\kappa^+<\mathfrak{i}_{\omega_1}(\kappa)<2^\kappa. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first example of a (\mu,\kappa)-maximal independent family of size strictly between \kappa^+ and 2^\kappa, for uncountable \kappa.   (3) \mathfrak{sp}_{\mathfrak i}(\mu,\kappa) cannot be quite arbitrary.
