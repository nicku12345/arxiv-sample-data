For I a proper, countably complete ideal on P(X) for some set X, can the quotient Boolean algebra P(X)/I be complete? This question was raised by Sikorski in 1949. By a simple projection argument as for measurable cardinals, it can be assumed that X is an uncountable cardinal kappa, and that I is a kappa-complete ideal on P(kappa) containing all singletons. In this paper we provide consequences from and consistency results about completeness.
