Based on computer simulations Wolfram presented in several papers conjectured classifications of cellular automata into 4 types. He distinguishes the 4 classes of cellular automata by the evolution of the pattern generated by applying a cellular automaton to a finite input. Wolfram's qualitative classification is based on the examination of a large number of simulations. In addition to this classification based on the rate of growth, he conjectured a similar classification according to the eventual pattern. We consider here one formalization of his rate of growth suggestion. After completing our major results (based only on Wolfram's work), we investigated other contributions to the area and we report the relation of some of them to our discoveries.
