A system of uniform families on an infinite subset M of \nn is a collection (\cca_{\xi})_{\xi<\omega_1} of families of finite subsets of \nn (where, \cca_k consists of all k--element subset of M, for k\in \nn) with the properties that each \cca_{\xi} is thin (i.e. it does not contain proper initial segments of any of its element) and the Cantor--Bendixson index, defined for \cca_{\xi}, is equal to \xi+1 and stable when we restrict ourselves to any subset of M. We indicate how to extend the generalized Schreier families to a system of uniform families. Using that notion we establish the correct (countable) ordinal index generalization of the classical Ramsey theorem (which corresponds to the finite ordinal indices).
