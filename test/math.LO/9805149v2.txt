Suppose that \lambda=\lambda^{<\lambda} \ge\aleph_0, and we are considering a theory T. We give a criterion on T which is sufficient for the consistent existence of \lambda^{++} universal models of T of size \lambda^+ for models of T of size \le\lambda^+, and is meaningful when 2^{\lambda^+}>\lambda^{++}. In fact, we work more generally with abstract elementary classes. The criterion for the consistent existence of universals applies to various well known theories, such as triangle-free graphs and simple theories.   Having in mind possible applications in analysis, we further observe that for such \lambda, for any fixed \mu>\lambda^+ regular with \mu=\mu^{\lambda^+}, it is consistent that 2^\lambda=\mu and there is no normed vector space over {\Bbf Q} of size <\mu which is universal for normed vector spaces over {\Bbf Q} of dimension \lambda^+ under the notion of embedding h which specifies (a,b) such that \norm{h(x)}/\norm{x}\in (a,b) for all x.
