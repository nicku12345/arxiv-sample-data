In this paper we prove that any strongly embedded subgroup of a K*-group G of finite Morley rank and odd type that does not interpret any bad field is solvable if its Pruefer 2-rank is at least 2. If the normal 2-rank of G is at least 3 this has two important consequences: If G contains a non-solvable centraliser of an involution, then G does not contain any proper 2-generated core and centralisers of involutions have trivial cores.
