This paper gives a characterisation of the group G_2(K) over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic not 2 inside the class of simple K*-groups of finite Morley rank not interpreting a bad field using the structure of centralizers of involutions. This implies a general characterisation of tame K*-groups od odd type whose centralizers have a certain natural structure.
