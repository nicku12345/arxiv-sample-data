The apparently trifling unexpected hanging paradox has generated an enormous philosophical literature. We introduce the mathematician to this literature, paying special attention to aspects that involve nontrivial mathematics. This xxx version of the paper contains an exhaustive bibliography that the editors of the Monthly deemed too lengthy to publish. The bibliography will be continually updated and readers are encouraged to inform the author of any omissions that they discover.
