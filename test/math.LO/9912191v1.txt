A group homomorphism eta:H-->G is called a localization of H if every homomorphism phi:H-->G can be `extended uniquely' to a homomorphism Phi:G-->G in the sense that Phi eta=phi.   Libman showed that a localization of a finite group need not be finite. This is exemplified by a well-known representation A_n-->SO_{n-1}(R) of the alternating group A_n, which turns out to be a localization for n even and n>9. Dror Farjoun asked if there is any upper bound in cardinality for localizations of A_n. In this paper we answer this question and prove, under the generalized continuum hypothesis, that every non abelian finite simple group H, has arbitrarily large localizations. This shows that there is a proper class of distinct homotopy types which are localizations of a given Eilenberg--Mac Lane space K(H,1) for any non abelian finite simple group H.
