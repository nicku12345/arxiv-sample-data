We provide a quasilinear time algorithm for the p-center problem with an additive error less than or equal to 3 times the input graph's hyperbolic constant. Specifically, for the graph G=(V,E) with n vertices, m edges and hyperbolic constant \delta, we construct an algorithm for p-centers in time O(p(\delta+1)(n+m)\log(n)) with radius not exceeding r_p + \delta when p \leq 2 and r_p + 3\delta when p \geq 3, where r_p are the optimal radii. Prior work identified p-centers with accuracy r_p+\delta but with time complexity O((n^3\log n + n^2m)\log(diam(G))) which is impractical for large graphs.
