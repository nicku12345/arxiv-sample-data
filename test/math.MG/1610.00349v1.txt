Let M be a compact d-dimensional Riemannian manifold without a boundary. Given E \subset M, let \Delta_{\rho}(E)=\{\rho(x,y): x,y \in E \}, where \rho is the Riemannian metric on M. Let \Delta_{\rho}^x denote the pinned distance set, namely, \{\rho(x,y): y \in E \} with x \in E. We prove that if the Hausdorff dimension of E is greater than \frac{d+1}{2}, then there exist many x \in E such that the Lebesgue measure of \Delta^x_{\rho}(E) is positive. This result was previously established by Peres and Schlag in the Euclidean setting. The main result is deduced from a variable coefficient Euclidean formulation, which can be used to study a variety of geometric problems. We extend our result to the setting of chains studied in \cite{BIT15} and obtain a pinned estimate in this context. Moreover, we point out that our scheme is quite universal in nature and this idea will be exploited in variety of settings in the sequel.
