We present a new algorithmic approach that can be used to determine whether a given quadruple (f_0,f_1,f_2,f_3) is the f-vector of any convex 4-dimensional polytope. By implementing this approach, we classify the f-vectors of 4-polytopes in the range f_0+f_3\le22.   In particular, we thus prove that there are f-vectors of cellular 3-spheres with the intersection property that are not f-vectors of any convex 4-polytopes, thus answering a question that may be traced back to the works of Steinitz (1906/1922). In the range f_0+f_3\le22, there are exactly three such f-vectors with f_0\le f_3, namely (10,32,33,11), (10,33,35,12), and (11,35,35,11).
