Kira Adaricheva and Madina Bolat have recently proved that if U_0 and U_1 are circles in a triangle with vertices A_0,A_1,A_2, then there exist j\in \{0,1,2\} and k\in\{0,1\} such that U_{1-k} is included in the convex hull of U_k\cup(\{A_0,A_1, A_2\}\setminus\{A_j\}). We give a short new proof for this result, and we point out that a straightforward generalizaton for shperes fails.
