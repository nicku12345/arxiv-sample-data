Skeletal polyhedra and polygonal complexes are finite or infinite periodic structures in 3-space with interesting geometric, combinatorial, and algebraic properties. These structures can be viewed as finite or infinite periodic graphs (nets) equipped with a polyhedral superstructure imposed by the faces, allowed to be skew, zigzag, or helical. The article describes skeletal structures with maximal symmetry.
