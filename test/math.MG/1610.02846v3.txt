The chromatic number \chi(\mathbb{R}^n) of the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^n is the smallest number of colors sufficient for coloring all points of the space in such a way that any two points at the distance 1 have different colors. In 1972 Larman--Rogers proved that \chi(\mathbb{R}^n) \leq (3 + o(1))^n. We give a new proof of this bound.
