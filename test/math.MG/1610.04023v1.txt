We show that for any 1\leq p\leq\infty, the family of random vectors uniformly distributed on hyperplane projections of the unit ball of \ell_p^n verify the variance conjecture  \textrm{Var}\,|X|^2\leq C\max_{\xi\in S^{n-1}}\mathbb{E}\langle X,\xi\rangle^2\mathbb{E}|X|^2,  where C depends on p but not on the dimension n or the hyperplane. We will also show a general result relating the variance conjecture for a random vector uniformly distributed on an isotropic convex body and the variance conjecture for a random vector uniformly distributed on any Steiner symmetrization of it. As a consequence we will have that the class of random vectors uniformly distributed on any Steiner symmetrization of an \ell_p^n-ball verify the variance conjecture.
