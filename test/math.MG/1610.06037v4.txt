A convex quadrilateral, Q, is called a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral if the intersection point of the diagonals of Q coincides with the midpoint of at least one of the diagonals of Q. A parallelogram, P, is a special case of a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral since the diagonals of P bisect one another. We prove two results about ellipses inscribed in midpoint diagonal quadrilaterals, which generalize properties of ellipses inscribed in parallelograms involving convex quadrilaterals. First, Q is a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral if and only if each ellipse inscribed in Q has tangency chords which are parallel to one of the diagonals of Q. Second, Q is a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral if and only if each ellipse inscribed in Q has a pair of conjugate diameters parallel to the diagonals of Q. Finally, we show that there is a unique ellipse, E_I, of minimal eccentricity incribed in a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral, Q, and we show that the equal conjugate diameters of E_I are parallel to the diagonals of Q.
