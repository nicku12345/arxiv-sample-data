For any metric d on \mathbb{R}^2, an (\mathbb{R}^2,d)-geometric graph is a graph whose vertices are points in \mathbb{R}^2, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is at most 1. If d=\|.\|_{\infty}, the metric derived from the L_{\infty} norm, then (\mathbb{R} ^2,\|.\|_{\infty})-geometric graphs are precisely those graphs that are the intersection of two unit interval graphs. We refer to (\mathbb{R}^2,\|.\|_{\infty})-geometric graphs as square geometric graphs. We represent a characterization of square geometric graphs. Using this characterization we provide necessary conditions for the class of square geometric B_{a,b}-graphs, a generalization of cobipartite graphs. Then by applying some restrictions on these necessary conditions we obtain sufficient conditions for B_{a,b}-graphs to be square geometric.
