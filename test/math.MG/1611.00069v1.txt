Square metrics F=\frac{(\alpha+\beta)^2}{\alpha} are a special class of Finsler metrics. It is the rate kind of metric category to be of excellent geometrical properties. In this paper, we discuss the so-called singular square metrics F=\frac{(b\alpha+\beta)^2}{\alpha}. A characterization for such metrics to be of vanishing Douglas curvature is provided. Moreover, many analytical examples are achieved by using a special kinds of metrical deformations called \beta-deformations.
