We say that two sets S,T\subset\{1,2,\dots,n\} are chord separated if there does not exist a cyclically ordered quadruple a,b,c,d of integers satisfying a,c\in S-T and b,d\in T-S. This is a weaker version of Leclerc and Zelevinsky's weak separation. We show that every maximal by inclusion collection of pairwise chord separated sets is also maximal by size. Moreover, we prove that such collections are precisely vertex label collections of fine zonotopal tilings of the three-dimensional cyclic zonotope. In our construction, plabic graphs and square moves appear naturally as horizontal sections of zonotopal tilings and their mutations respectively.
