We prove that if any \lfloor3d/2 \rfloor or fewer elements of a finite family of linear operators \mathbb K^d\to \mathbb K^d (\mathbb K is an arbitrary field) have a common eigenvector then all operators in the family have a common eigenvector. Moreover, \lfloor 3d/2\rfloor cannot be replaced by a smaller number. Also, we study the following problem, achieving partial results: prove that if any l=O(d) or fewer elements of a finite family of linear operators \mathbb K^d\to \mathbb K^d have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then all operators in the family have a common non-trivial invariant subspace.
