In 1994, Jan Pelant proved that a metric property related to the notion of paracompactness called the uniform Stone property characterizes a metric space's uniform embeddability into c_0(\kappa) for some cardinality \kappa. In this paper it is shown that coarse Lipschitz embeddability of a metric space into c_0(\kappa) can be characterized in a similar manner. It is also shown that coarse, uniform, and bi-Lipschitz embeddability into c_0(\kappa) are equivalent notions for normed linear spaces.
