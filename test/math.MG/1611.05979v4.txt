 \newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}} \newcommand{\lat}{\mathcal{L}} We prove a conjecture due to Dadush, showing that if \lat \subset \R^n is a lattice such that \det(\lat') \ge 1 for all sublattices \lat' \subseteq \lat, then \[ \sum_{\vec y \in \lat} e^{-t^2 \|\vec y\|^2} \le 3/2 \; , \] where t := 10(\log n + 2). From this we also derive bounds on the number of short lattice vectors and on the covering radius.
