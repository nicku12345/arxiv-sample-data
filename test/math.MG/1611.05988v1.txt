Asymptotic property C was introduced by Dranishnikov to study spaces with infinite asymptotic dimension. We show that asymptotic property C is preserved by infinite products. We also show that countable restricted direct products of countable groups with finite asymptotic dimension have asymptotic property C. Then we introduce hyperbolic property C, an infinite dimensional version of hyperbolic dimension.
