We introduce and discuss the concept of \emph{n-distance}, a generalization to n elements of the classical notion of distance obtained by replacing the triangle inequality with the so-called simplex inequality  d(x_1, \ldots, x_n)~\leq~K\, \sum_{i=1}^n d(x_1, \ldots, x_n)_i^z{\,}, \qquad x_1, \ldots, x_n, z \in X,  where K=1. Here d(x_1,\ldots,x_n)_i^z is obtained from the function d(x_1,\ldots,x_n) by setting its ith variable to z. We provide several examples of n-distances, and for each of them we investigate the infimum of the set of real numbers K\in\left]0,1\right] for which the inequality above holds. We also introduce a generalization of the concept of n-distance obtained by replacing in the simplex inequality the sum function with an arbitrary symmetric function.
