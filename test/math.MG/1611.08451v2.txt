We construct box spaces of a free group that do not coarsely embed into a Hilbert space, but do not contain coarsely embedded expanders. We do this by considering two sequences of subgroups of the free group: one which gives rise to a box space which forms an expander, and another which gives rise to a box space that can be coarsely embedded into a Hilbert space. We then take certain intersections of these subgroups, and prove that the corresponding box space contains generalized expanders. We show that there are no coarsely embedded expanders in the box space corresponding to our chosen sequence by proving that a box space that covers another box space of the same group that is coarsely embeddable into a Hilbert space cannot contain coarsely embedded expanders.
