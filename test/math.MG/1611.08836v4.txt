The evolute of a smooth curve in an m-dimensional Euclidean space is the locus of centers of its osculating spheres, and the evolute of a spatial polygon is the polygon whose consecutive vertices are the centers of the spheres through the consecutive (m+1)-tuples of vertices of the original polygon. We study the iterations of these evolute transformations. This work continues the recent study of similar problems in dimension two, see arXiv:1510.07742. Here is a sampler of our results. The set of n-gons with fixed directions of the sides, considered up to parallel translation, is an (n-m)-dimensional vector space, and the second evolute transformation is a linear map of this space. If n=m+2, then the second evolute is homothetic to the original polygon, and if n=m+3, then the first and the third evolutes are homothetic. In general, each eigenvalue of the second evolute map has double multiplicity. We also study curves, with cusps, in 3-dimensional Euclidean space and their evolutes. We provide continuous analogs of the results obtained for polygons, and present a class of curves which are homothetic to their second evolutes; these curves are spatial analogs of the classical hypocycloids.
