Let K_0 be a compact convex subset of the plane \mathbb R^2, and assume that K_1\subseteq \mathbb R^2 is similar to K_0, that is, K_1 is the image of K_0 with respect to a similarity transformation \mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^2. Kira Adaricheva and Madina Bolat have recently proved that if K_0 is a disk and both K_0 and K_1 are included in a triangle with vertices A_0, A_1, and A_2, then there exist a j\in \{0,1,2\} and a k\in\{0,1\} such that K_{1-k} is included in the convex hull of K_k\cup(\{A_0,A_1, A_2\}\setminus\{A_j\}). Here we prove that this property characterizes disks among compact convex subsets of the plane. Actually, we prove even more since we replace "similar" by "isometric" (also called "congruent"). Circles are the boundaries of disks, so our result also gives a characterization of circles.
