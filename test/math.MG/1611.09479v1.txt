The set of points in a metric space is called an s-distance set if pairwise distances between these points admit only s distinct values. Two-distance spherical sets with the set of scalar products \{\alpha, -\alpha\}, \alpha\in[0,1), are called equiangular. The problem of determining the maximum size of s-distance sets in various spaces has a long history in mathematics. We suggest a new method of bounding the size of an s-distance set in compact two-point homogeneous spaces via zonal spherical functions. This method allows us to prove that the maximum size of a spherical two-distance set in \mathbb{R}^n, n\geq 7, is \frac{n(n+1)}2 with possible exceptions for some n=(2k+1)^2-3, k \in \mathbb{N}. We also prove the universal upper bound \sim \frac 2 3 n a^2 for equiangular sets with \alpha=\frac 1 a and, employing this bound, prove a new upper bound on the size of equiangular sets in all dimensions. Finally, we classify all equiangular sets reaching this new bound.
