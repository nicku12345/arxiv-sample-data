For a unimodular random graph (G,\rho), we consider deformations of its intrinsic path metric by a (random) weighting of its vertices. This leads to the notion of the conformal growth exponent of (G,\rho), which is the best asymptotic degree of volume growth of balls that can be achieved by such a reweighting. Under moment conditions on the degree of the root, we show that the conformal growth exponent of a unimodular random graph bounds its almost sure spectral dimension. This has interesting consequences for many low-dimensional models.   The consequences in dimension two are particularly strong. It establishes that models like the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT) and quadrangulation (UIPQ) almost surely have spectral dimension at most two. It also establishes a conjecture of Benjamini and Schramm (2001) by extending their Recurrence Theorem from planar graphs to arbitrary families of H-minor free graphs. More generally, it strengthens the work of Gurel-Gurevich and Nachmias (2013) who established recurrence for distributional limits of planar graphs when the degree of the root has exponential tails.   We further present a general method for proving subdiffusivity of the random walk on a large class of models, including UIPT and UIPQ, using only the volume growth profile of balls in the intrinsic metric.
