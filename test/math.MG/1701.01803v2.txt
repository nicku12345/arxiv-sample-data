In this paper, we will establish an elliptic local Li-Yau gradient estimate for weak solutions of the heat equation on metric measure spaces with generalized Ricci curvature bounded from below. One of its main applications is a sharp gradient estimate for the logarithm of heat kernels. These results seem new even for smooth Riemannian manifolds.
