We prove that for any 1 \le k<n and s\le 1, the union of any nonempty s-Hausdorff dimensional family of k-dimensional affine subspaces of {\mathbb R}^n has Hausdorff dimension k+s. More generally, we show that for any 0 < \alpha \le k, if B \subset {\mathbb R}^n and E is a nonempty collection of k-dimensional affine subspaces of {\mathbb R}^n such that every P \in E intersects B in a set of Hausdorff dimension at least \alpha, then \dim B \ge 2 \alpha - k + \min(\dim E, 1), where \dim denotes the Hausdorff dimension. As a consequence, we generalize the well known Furstenberg-type estimate that every \alpha-Furstenberg set has Hausdorff dimension at least 2 \alpha; we strengthen a theorem of Falconer and Mattila; and we show that for any 0 \le k<n, if a set A \subset {\mathbb R}^n contains the k-skeleton of a rotated unit cube around every point of {\mathbb R}^n, or if A contains a k-dimensional affine subspace at a fixed positive distance from every point of {\mathbb R}^n, then the Hausdorff dimension of A is at least k + 1.
