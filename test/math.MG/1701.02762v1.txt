Let T\subset{\mathbb R}^n be a fixed set. By a scaled copy of T around x\in{\mathbb R}^n we mean a set of the form x+rT for some r>0.   In this survey paper we study results about the following type of problems: How small can a set be if it contains a scaled copy of T around every point of a set of given size? We will consider the cases when T is circle or sphere centered at the origin, Cantor set in {\mathbb R}, the boundary of a square centered at the origin, or more generally the k-skeleton (0\le k<n) of an n-dimensional cube centered at the origin or the k-skeleton of a more general polytope of {\mathbb R}^n.   We also study the case when we allow not only scaled copies but also scaled and rotated copies and also the case when we allow only rotated copies.
