We use the recently established existence and regularity of area and energy minimizing discs in metric spaces to obtain canonical parametrizations of metric surfaces. Our approach yields a new and conceptually simple proof of a well-known theorem of Bonk and Kleiner on the existence of quasisymmetric parametrizations of linearly locally connected, Ahlfors 2-regular metric 2-spheres. Generalizations and applications to the geometry of such surfaces are described.
