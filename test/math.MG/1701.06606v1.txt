We consider mixed integer linear programs where free integer variables are expressed in terms of nonnegative continuous variables. When this model only has two integer variables, Dey and Louveaux characterized the intersection cuts that have infinite split rank. We show that, for any number of integer variables, the split rank of an intersection cut generated from a bounded convex set P is finite if and only if the integer points on the boundary of P satisfy a certain "2-hyperplane property". The Dey-Louveaux characterization is a consequence of this more general result.
