We solve the classical problem of Plateau in every metric space which is 1-complemented in an ultra-completion of itself. This includes all proper metric spaces as well as many locally non-compact metric spaces, in particular, all dual Banach spaces, some non-dual Banach spaces such as L^1, all Hadamard spaces, and many more. Our results generalize corresponding results of Lytchak and the second author from the setting of proper metric spaces to that of locally non-compact ones. We furthermore solve the Dirichlet problem in the same class of spaces. The main new ingredient in our proofs is a suitable generalization of the Rellich-Kondrachov compactness theorem, from which we deduce a result about ultra-limits of sequences of Sobolev maps.
