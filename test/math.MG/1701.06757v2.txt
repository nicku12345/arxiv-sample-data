A compact hyperbolic "cobweb" manifold (hyperbolic space form) of symbol Cw(6,6,6) will be constructed in Fig.1,4,5 as a representant of a presumably infinite series Cw(2p,2p,2p) (3 \le p \in \bN natural numbers). This is a by-product of our investigations \cite{MSz16}. In that work dense ball packings and coverings of hyperbolic space \HYP have been constructed on the base of complete hyperbolic Coxeter orthoschemes \mathcal{O}=W_{uvw} and its extended reflection groups \bG (see diagram in Fig.~3. and picture of fundamental domain in Fig.~2). Now u=v=w=6 (=2p). Thus the maximal ball contained in Cw(6,6,6), moreover its minimal covering bal l (so diameter) can also be determined. The algorithmic procedure provides us with the proof of our statements.
