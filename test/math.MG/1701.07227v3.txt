Suppose that \{G_n\} is a sequence of finite graphs such that each G_n is the tangency graph of a sphere packing in \mathbb{R}^d. Let \rho_n be a uniformly random vertex of G_n and suppose that (G,\rho) is the distributional limit of \{(G_n,\rho_n)\} in the sense of Benjamini and Schramm. Then the conformal growth exponent of (G,\rho) is at most d. In other words, there exists a unimodular "unit volume" weighting of the graph metric on (G,\rho) such that the volume growth of balls in the weighted path metric is bounded by a polynomial of degree d. This generalizes to limits of graphs that can be "coarsely" packed in an Ahlfors d-regular metric measure space.   Using our previous work, this implies that, under moment conditions on the degree of the root \rho,the almost sure spectral dimension of G is at most d. This fact was known previously only for graphs packed in \mathbb{R}^2 (planar graphs), and the case of d > 2 eluded approaches based on extremal length. In the process of bounding the spectral dimension, we establish that the spectral measure of (G,\rho) is dominated by a variant of the d-dimensional Weyl law.
