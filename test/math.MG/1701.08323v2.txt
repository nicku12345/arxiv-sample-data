Let (x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} be a sequence on the torus \mathbb{T} (normalized to length 1). We show that if there exists a sequence of positive real numbers (t_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} converging to 0 such that \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}{ \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{m,n = 1}^{N}{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{t_N}} \exp{\left(- \frac{1}{t_N} (x_m - x_n)^2 \right)}} } = \sqrt{\pi}, then (x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} is uniformly distributed. This is especially interesting when t_N is close to N^{-2} since the size of the sum is then mostly determined by local gaps at scale \sim N^{-1}. A similar argument can then be used to show equidistribution of sequences with Poissonian pair correlation, which recovers a recent result of Aistleitner, Lachmann \& Pausinger and Grepstad \& Larcher. The general form of the result is proven on arbitrary compact manifolds (M,g) where the role of the exponential function is played by the heat kernel e^{t\Delta}: for all x_1, \dots, x_N \in M and all t>0 \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{m,n=1}^N {[e^{t\Delta}\delta_{x_m}](x_n)} \geq \frac{1}{vol(M)} and equality is attained as N \rightarrow \infty if and only if (x_n)_{n=1}^\infty equidistributes.
