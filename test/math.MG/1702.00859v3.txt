Let n be a sufficiently large natural number and let B be an origin-symmetric convex body in R^n in the \ell-position, and such that the normed space (R^n,\|\cdot\|_B) admits a 1-unconditional basis. Then for any \varepsilon\in(0,1/2], and for random c\varepsilon\log n/\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}-dimensional subspace E distributed according to the rotation-invariant (Haar) measure, the section B\cap E is (1+\varepsilon)-Euclidean with probability close to one. This shows that the "worst-case" dependence on \varepsilon in the randomized Dvoretzky theorem in the \ell-position is significantly better than in John's position. It is a previously unexplored feature, which has strong connections with the concept of superconcentration introduced by S. Chatterjee. In fact, our main result follows from the next theorem: Let B be as before and assume additionally that B has a smooth boundary and {\mathbb E}_{\gamma_n}\|\cdot\|_B\leq n^c\,{\mathbb E}_{\gamma_n}\big\|{\rm grad}_B(\cdot)\big\|_2 for a small universal constant c>0, where {\rm grad}_B(\cdot) is the gradient of \|\cdot\|_B and \gamma_n is the standard Gaussian measure in R^n. Then for any p\in[1,c\log n] the p-th power of the norm \|\cdot\|_B^p is \frac{C}{\log n}--superconcentrated in the Gauss space.
