Until now, little was known about properties of small cells in a Poisson hyperplane tessellation. The few existing results were either heuristic or applying only to the two dimensional case and for very specific size functionals and directional distributions. This paper fills this gap by providing a systematic study of small cells in a Poisson hyperplane tessellation of arbitrary dimension, arbitrary directional distribution \varphi and with respect to an arbitrary size functional \Sigma. More precisely, we investigate the distribution of the typical cell Z, conditioned on the event \{\Sigma(Z)<a\}, where a\to0 and \Sigma is a size functional, i.e. a functional on the set of convex bodies which is continuous, not identically zero, homogeneous of degree k>0, and increasing with respect to set inclusion. We focus on the number of facets and the shape of such small cells. We show in various general settings that small cells tend to minimize the number of facets and that they have a non degenerated limit shape distribution which depends on the size \Sigma and the directional distribution. We also exhibit a class of directional distribution for which cells with small inradius do not tend to minimize the number of facets.
