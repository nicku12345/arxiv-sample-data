We obtain a topological and equivariant classification of closed, connected three-dimensional Alexandrov spaces admitting a local isometric circle action. We show, in particular, that such spaces are homeomorphic to connected sums of some closed 3-manifold with a local circle action and finitely many copies of the suspension of the real projective plane.
