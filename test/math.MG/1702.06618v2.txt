We discuss the notion of sublinearly bilipschitz equivalences (SBE), which generalize quasi-isometries, allowing some additional terms that behave sublinearly with respect to the distance from the origin. Such maps were originally motivated by the fact they induce bilipschitz homeomorphisms between asymptotic cones. We prove here that for hyperbolic groups, they also induce H\"older homeomorphisms between the boundaries. This yields many basic examples of hyperbolic groups that are pairwise non-SBE. Besides, we check that subexponential growth is an SBE-invariant.   The central part of the paper addresses nilpotent groups. While classification up to sublinearly bilipschitz equivalence is known in this case as a consequence of Pansu's theorems, its quantitative version is not. We introduce a computable algebraic invariant e=e_G<1 for every such group G, and check that G is O(r^e)-bilipschitz equivalent to its associated Carnot group. Here r\mapsto r^e is a quantitive sublinear bound.   Finally, we define the notion of large-scale contractable and large-scale homothetic metric spaces. We check that these notions imply polynomial growth under general hypotheses, and formulate conjectures about groups with these properties.
