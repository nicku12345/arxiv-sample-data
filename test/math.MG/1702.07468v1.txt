We study configuration spaces of linkages whose underlying graph are polygons with diagonal constrains, or more general, partial two-trees. We show that (with an appropriate definition) the oriented area is a Bott-Morse function on the configuration space. Its critical points are described and Bott-Morse indices are computed. This paper is a generalization of analogous results for polygonal linkages (obtained earlier by G. Khimshiashvili, G. Panina, and A. Zhukova).
