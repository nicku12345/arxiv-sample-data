Let P_n be an n-dimensional regular polytope from one of the three infinite series (regular simplices, regular crosspolytopes, and cubes). Project P_n onto a random, uniformly distributed linear subspace of dimension d\geq 2. We prove that the expected number of k-dimensional faces of the resulting random polytope is an increasing function of n. As a corollary, we show that the expected number of k-faces of the Gaussian polytope is an increasing function of the number of points used to generate the polytope. Similar results are obtained for the symmetric Gaussian polytope and the Gaussian zonotope.
