For X a metric space and r>0 a scale parameter, the Vietoris-Rips complex VR_<(X;r) (resp. VR_\leq(X;r)) has X as its vertex set, and a finite subset \sigma\subseteq X as a simplex whenever the diameter of \sigma is less than r (resp. at most r). Though Vietoris-Rips complexes have been studied at small choices of scale by Hausmann and Latschev, they are not well-understood at larger scale parameters. In this paper we investigate the homotopy types of Vietoris-Rips complexes of ellipses Y=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2~|~(x/a)^2+y^2=1\} of small eccentricity, meaning 1<a\le\sqrt{2}. Indeed, we show there are constants r_1 < r_2 such that for all r_1 < r< r_2, we have VR_<(X;r)\simeq S^2 and VR_\leq(X;r)\simeq \bigvee^5 S^2, though only one of the two-spheres in VR_\leq(X;r) is persistent. Furthermore, we show that for any scale parameter r_1 < r < r_2, there are arbitrarily dense subsets of the ellipse such that the Vietoris-Rips complex of the subset is not homotopy equivalent to the Vietoris-Rips complex of the entire ellipse. As our main tool we link these homotopy types to the structure of infinite cyclic graphs.
