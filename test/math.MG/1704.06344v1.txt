Trace classes of Sobolev-type functions in metric spaces are subject of this paper. In particular, functions on domains whose boundary has an upper codimension-\theta bound are considered. Based on a Poincar\'e inequality, existence of a Borel measurable trace is proven whenever the power of integrability of the "gradient" exceeds \theta. The trace T is shown to be a compact operator mapping a Sobolev-type space on a domain into a Besov space on the boundary. Sufficient conditions for T to be surjective are found and counterexamples showing that surjectivity may fail are also provided. The case when the exponent of integrability of the "gradient" is equal to \theta, i.e., the codimension of the boundary, is also discussed. Under some additional assumptions, the trace lies in L^\theta on the boundary then. Essential sharpness of these extra assumptions is illustrated by an example.
