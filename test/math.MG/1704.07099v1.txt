Let A be an expanding d\times d matrix with integer entries and {\mathcal D}\subset {\mathbb Z}^d be a finite digit set. Then the pair (A, {\mathcal D}) defines a unique integral self-affine set K=A^{-1}(K+{\mathcal D}). In this paper, by replacing the Euclidean norm with a pseudo-norm w in terms of A, we construct a hyperbolic graph on (A, {\mathcal D}) and show that K can be identified with the hyperbolic boundary. Moreover, if (A, {\mathcal D}) safisfies the open set condition, we also prove that two totally disconnected integral self-affine sets are Lipschitz equivalent if an only if they have the same w-Hausdorff dimension, that is, their digit sets have equal cardinality. We extends some well-known results in the self-similar sets to the self-affine sets.
