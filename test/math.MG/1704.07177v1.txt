The Ehrhart polynomial and the reciprocity theorems by Ehrhart \& Macdonald are extended to tensor valuations on lattice polytopes. A complete classification is established of tensor valuations of rank up to eight that are equivariant with respect to the special linear group over the integers and translation covariant. Every such valuation is a linear combination of the Ehrhart tensors which is shown to no longer hold true for rank nine.
