Given a compact set E \subset \mathbb{R}^{d - 1}, d \geq 1, write K_{E} := [0,1] \times E \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}. A theorem of C. Bishop and J. Tyson states that any set of the form K_{E} is minimal for conformal dimension: if (X,d) is a metric space and f \colon K_{E} \to (X,d) is a quasisymmetric homeomorphism, then \dim_{\mathrm{H}} f(K_{E}) \geq \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K_{E}. We prove that the measure-theoretic analogue of the result is not true. For any d \geq 2 and 0 \leq s < d - 1, there exist compact sets E \subset \mathbb{R}^{d - 1} with 0 < \mathcal{H}^{s}(E) < \infty such that the conformal dimension of \nu, the restriction of the (1 + s)-dimensional Hausdorff measure on K_{E}, is zero. More precisely, for any \epsilon > 0, there exists a quasisymmetric embedding F \colon K_{E} \to \mathbb{R}^{d} such that \dim_{\mathrm{H}} F_{\sharp}\nu < \epsilon.
