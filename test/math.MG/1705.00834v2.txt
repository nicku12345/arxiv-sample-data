From any two median spaces X,Y, we construct a new median space X \circledast Y, referred to as the diadem product of X and Y, and we show that this construction is compatible with wreath products in the following sense: given two finitely generated groups G,H and two (equivariant) coarse embeddings into median spaces X,Y, there exist a(n equivariant) coarse embedding G\wr H \to X \circledast Y. As an application, we prove that \alpha_1(G \wr H) \geq \min(\alpha_1(G),\alpha_1(H))/2 \text{ for all finitely generated groups G,H,} where \alpha_1(\cdot) denotes the \ell^1-compression. As an other consequence, we recover several well-known theorems related to the Hilbertian geometry of wreath products from a unified point of view: the characterisation of wreath products satisfying Kazhdan's property (T) or the Haagerup property, as well as their discrete versions (FW) and (PW).
