In this paper, we address the following algebraic generalization of the bipartite stable set problem. We are given a block-structured matrix (partitioned matrix) A = (A_{\alpha \beta}), where A_{\alpha \beta} is an m_{\alpha} by n_{\beta} matrix over field {\bf F} for \alpha=1,2,\ldots,\mu and \beta = 1,2,\ldots,\nu. The maximum vanishing subspace problem (MVSP) is to maximize \sum_{\alpha} \dim X_{\alpha} + \sum_{\beta} \dim Y_{\beta} over vector subspaces X_{\alpha} \subseteq {\bf F}^{m_{\alpha}} for \alpha=1,2,\ldots,\mu and Y_{\beta} \subseteq {\bf F}^{n_{\beta}} for \beta = 1,2,\ldots,\nu such that each A_{\alpha \beta} vanishes on X_{\alpha} \times Y_{\beta} when A_{\alpha \beta} is viewed as a bilinear form {\bf F}^{m_{\alpha}} \times {\bf F}^{n_{\beta}} \to {\bf F}. This problem arises from a study of a canonical block-triangular form of A by Ito, Iwata, and Murota~(1994), and is closely related to the noncommutative rank of a matrix with indeterminates. We prove that a weighted version (WMVP) of MVSP can be solved in psuedo polynomial time, provided arithmetic operations on {\bf F} can be done in constant time. Our proof is a novel combination of submodular optimization on modular lattice and convex optimization on CAT(0)-space. We present implications of this result on block-triangularization of partitioned matrix.
