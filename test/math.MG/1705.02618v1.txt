In this paper we provide an alternative reduction theory for real, binary forms with no real roots. Our approach is completely geometric, making use of the notion of hyperbolic center of mass in the upper half-plane. It appears that our model compares favorably with existing reduction theories, at least in certain aspects related to the field of definition. Various tools and features of hyperbolic geometry that are interesting in themselves, but also relevant for our and various other reduction theories papers (\cite{julia} and \cite{SC}), are also treated in detail and in a self-contained way here.
