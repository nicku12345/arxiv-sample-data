In 3- and 4-dimensional hyperbolic spaces there are four, respectively five, regular mosaics with bounded cells. A belt can be created around an arbitrary base vertex of a mosaic. The construction can be iterated and a growing ratio can be determined by using the number of the cells of the considered belts. In this article we determine these growing ratios for each mosaic in a generalized way.
