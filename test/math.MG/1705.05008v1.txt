Suppose (M^{n},g) is a Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, and let h_{d}(M) be the dimension of the space of harmonic functions with polynomial growth of growth order at most d. Colding and Minicozzi proved that h_{d}(M) is finite. Later on, there are many researches which give better estimates of h_{d}(M). We study the behavior of h_{d}(M) when d is large in this paper. More precisely, suppose that (M^{n},g) has maximal volume growth and has a unique tangent cone at infinity, then when d is sufficiently large, we obtain some estimates of h_{d}(M) in terms of the growth order d, the dimension n and the the asymptotic volume ratio \alpha=\lim_{R\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\mathrm{Vol}(B_{p}(R))}{R^{n}}. When \alpha=\omega_{n}, i.e., (M^{n},g) is isometric to the Euclidean space, the asymptotic behavior obtained in this paper recovers a well-known asymptotic property of h_{d}(\mathbb{R}^{n}).
