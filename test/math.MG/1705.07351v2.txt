We consider the sound ranging problem, which is to find the position of the source-point from the moments when the wave-sphere of linearly, with time, increasing radius reaches the sensor-points, in the infinite-dimensional separable Euclidean space H, and describe the solving methods, for entire space and for its unit sphere. In the former case, we give some sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the solution. We also provide two examples with the sets of sensors being a basis of H: 1st, when sound ranging problem and so-called dual problem both have single solutions, and 2nd, when sound ranging problem has two distinct solutions.
