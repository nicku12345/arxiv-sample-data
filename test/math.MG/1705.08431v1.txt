We provide an algebraic description of the Teichm\"uller space and moduli space of flat metrics on a closed manifold or orbifold and study its boundary, which consists of (isometry classes of) flat orbifolds to which the original object may collapse. It is also shown that every closed flat orbifold can be obtained by collapsing closed flat manifolds, and the collapsed limits of closed flat 3-manifolds are classified.
