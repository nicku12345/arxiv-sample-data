The main result: for every sequence \{\omega_m\}_{m=1}^\infty of positive numbers (\omega_m>0) there exists an isometric embedding F:[0,1]\to L_1[0,1] which is nowhere differentiable, but for each t\in [0,1] the image F_t is infinitely differentiable on [0,1] with bounds \max_{x\in[0,1]}|F_t^{(m)}(x)|\le\omega_m and has an analytic extension to the complex plane which is an entire function.
