A family of homothets of an o-symmetric convex body K in d-dimensional Euclidean space is called a Minkowski arrangement if no homothet contains the center of any other homothet in its interior. We show that any pairwise intersecting Minkowski arrangement of a d-dimensional convex body has at most 2\cdot 3^d members. This improves a result of Polyanskii (arXiv:1610.04400). Using similar ideas, we also give a proof the following result of Polyanskii: Let K_1,\dots,K_n be a sequence of homothets of the o-symmetric convex body K, such that for any i<j, the center of K_j lies on the boundary of K_i. Then n\leq O(3^d d).
