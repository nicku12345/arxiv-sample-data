We characterize preserved extreme points of Lipschitz-free spaces \mathcal{F}(X) in terms of simple geometric conditions on the underlying metric space (X,d). Namely, each preserved extreme point corresponds to a pair of points p,q in X such that the triangle inequality d(p,q)\leq d(p,r)+d(q,r) is uniformly strict for r away from p,q. For compact X, this condition reduces to the triangle inequality being strict. This result gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of N. Weaver that compact spaces are concave if and only if they have no triple of metrically aligned points.
