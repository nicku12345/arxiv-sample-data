We study a notion of generalized H\"older continuity for functions on \mathbb{R}^d. We show that for any bounded function f of bounded support and any r>0, the r-oscillation of f defined as osc_r f (x):= \sup_{B_r(x)} f - \inf_{B_r(x)} f is automatically generalized H\"older continuous, and we give an estimate for the appropriate (semi)norm. This is motivated by applications in the theory of dynamical systems.
