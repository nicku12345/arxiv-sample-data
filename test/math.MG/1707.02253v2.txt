Let X_1,\ldots,X_n be i.i.d.\ random points in the d-dimensional Euclidean space sampled according to one of the following probability densities:  f_{d,\beta} (x) = \text{const} \cdot (1-\|x\|^2)^{\beta}, \quad \|x\|\leq 1, \quad \text{(the beta case)}  and  \tilde f_{d,\beta} (x) = \text{const} \cdot (1+\|x\|^2)^{-\beta}, \quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d, \quad \text{(the beta' case).}  We compute exactly the expected intrinsic volumes and the expected number of facets of the convex hull of X_1,\ldots,X_n. Asymptotic formulae where obtained previously by Affentranger [The convex hull of random points with spherically symmetric distributions, 1991]. By studying the limits of the beta case when \beta\downarrow -1, respectively \beta \uparrow +\infty, we can also cover the models in which X_1,\ldots,X_n are uniformly distributed on the unit sphere or normally distributed, respectively. We obtain similar results for the random polytopes defined as the convex hulls of \pm X_1,\ldots,\pm X_n and 0,X_1,\ldots,X_n. One of the main tools used in the proofs is the Blaschke-Petkantschin formula.
