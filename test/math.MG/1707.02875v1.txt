The paper considers systems of contraction similarities in \mathbb R^d sending a given polyhedron P to polyhedra P_i\subset P, whose non-empty intersections are singletons and contain the common vertices of those polyhedra, while the intersection hypergraph of the system is acyclic. It is proved that the attractor K of such system is a dendrite in \mathbb R^d. The ramification points of such dendrite fave finite order whose upper bound depends only on the polyhedron P, and the set of the cut points of the dendrite K is equal to the dimension of the whole K iff K is a Jordan arc.
