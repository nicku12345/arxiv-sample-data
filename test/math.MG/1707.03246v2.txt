Let K \subset \mathbb R^n be a convex body with barycenter at the origin. We show there is a simplex S \subset K having also barycenter at the origin such that \left(\frac{vol(S)}{vol(K)}\right)^{1/n} \geq \frac{c}{\sqrt{n}}, where c>0 is an absolute constant. This is achieved using stochastic geometric techniques. Precisely, if K is in isotropic position, we present a method to find centered simplices verifying the above bound that works with very high probability.   As a consequence, we provide correct asymptotic estimates on an old problem in convex geometry. Namely, we show that the simplex S_{min}(K) of minimal volume enclosing a given convex body K \subset \mathbb R^n, fulfills the following inequality \left(\frac{vol(S_{min}(K))}{vol(K)}\right)^{1/n} \leq d \sqrt{n}, for some absolute constant d>0. Up to the constant, the estimate cannot be lessened.
