A classification of \operatorname{SL}(n) and translation covariant Minkowski valuations on log-concave functions is established. The moment vector and the recently introduced level set body of log-concave functions are characterized. Furthermore, analogs of the Euler characteristic and volume are characterized as \operatorname{SL}(n) and translation invariant valuations on log-concave functions.
