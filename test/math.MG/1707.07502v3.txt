The "Mahler volume" is, intuitively speaking, a measure of how "round" a centrally symmetric convex body is. In one direction this intuition is given weight by a result of Santalo, who in the 1940s showed that the Mahler volume is maximized, in a given dimension, by the unit sphere and its linear images, and only these. A counterpart to this result in the opposite direction is proposed by a conjecture, formulated by Kurt Mahler in the 1930s and still open in dimensions 4 and greater, asserting that the Mahler volume should be minimized by a cuboid. In this article we present a seemingly new proof of the 2-dimensional case of this conjecture via the probabilistic method. The central idea is to show that either deleting a random pair of edges from a centrally symmetric convex polygon, or deleting a random pair of vertices, reduces the Mahler volume with positive probability.
