Benjamini and Schramm (1996) used circle packing to prove that every transient, bounded degree planar graph admits non-constant harmonic functions of finite Dirichlet energy. We refine their result, showing in particular that for every transient, bounded degree, simple planar triangulation T and every circle packing of T in a domain D, there is a canonical, explicit bounded linear isomorphism between the space of harmonic Dirichlet functions on T and the space of harmonic Dirichlet functions on D.
