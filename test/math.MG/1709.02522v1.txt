In this paper, we show that the strong embeddability has fibering permanence property and is preserved under the direct limit for the metric space. Moreover, we show the following result: let G is a finitely generated group with a coarse quasi-action on a metric space X. If X has finite asymptotic dimension and the quasi-stabilizers are strongly embeddable, then G is also strongly embeddable.
