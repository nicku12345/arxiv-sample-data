We present a simple construction of an acute set of size 2^{d-1}+1 in \mathbb{R}^d for any dimension d. That is, we explicitly give 2^{d-1}+1 points in the d-dimensional Euclidean space with the property that any three points form an acute triangle. It is known that the maximal number of such points is less than 2^d. Our result significantly improves upon a recent construction, due to Dmitriy Zakharov, with size of order \varphi^d where \varphi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.618 is the golden ratio.
