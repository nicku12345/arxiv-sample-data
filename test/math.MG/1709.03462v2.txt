We give a complete description of the horofunction boundary of finite-dimensional \ell_p spaces for 1\leq p\leq \infty. We also study the variation norm on \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{N}}, \mathcal{N}=\{1,...,N\}, and the corresponding horofunction boundary. As a consequence, we describe the horofunctions for Hilbert's projective metric on the interior of the standard cone \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{N}}_{+} of \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{N}}.
