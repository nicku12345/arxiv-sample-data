A compact circle-packing P of the Euclidean plane is a set of circles which bound mutually disjoint open discs with the property that, for every circle S\in P, there exists a maximal indexed set \{A_{0},\ldots,A_{n-1}\}\subseteq P so that, for every i\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}, the circle A_{i} is tangent to both circles S and A_{i+1\mod n}.   We show that there exist at most 13617 pairs (r,s) with 0<s<r<1 for which there exist a compact circle-packing of the plane consisting of circles with radii s, r and 1.   We discuss computing the exact values of such 0<s<r<1 as roots of polynomials and exhibit a selection of compact circle-packings consisting of circles of three radii. We also discuss the apparent infeasibility of computing \emph{all} these values on contemporary consumer hardware with the methods employed in this paper.
