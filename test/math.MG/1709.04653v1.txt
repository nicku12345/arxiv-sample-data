Let d \geq 2 and d - 1 < s < d. Let \mu be a compactly supported Radon measure in \mathbb{R}^{d} with finite s-energy. I prove that the radial projections \pi_{x\sharp}\mu of \mu are absolutely continuous with respect to \mathcal{H}^{d - 1} for every centre x \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus \operatorname{spt} \mu, outside an exceptional set of dimension at most 2(d - 1) - s. This is sharp. In fact, for x outside an exceptional set as above, \pi_{x\sharp}\mu \in L^{p}(S^{d - 1}) for some p > 1.
