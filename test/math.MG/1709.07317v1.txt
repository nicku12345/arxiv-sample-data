In this review, we count and classify certain sublattices of a given lattice, as motivated by crystallography. We use methods from algebra and algebraic number theory to find and enumerate the sublattices according to their index. In addition, we use tools from analytic number theory to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding counting functions. Our main focus lies on similar sublattices and coincidence site lattices, the latter playing an important role in crystallography. As many results are algebraic in nature, we also generalise them to \mathbb{Z}-modules embedded in \mathbb{R}^d.
