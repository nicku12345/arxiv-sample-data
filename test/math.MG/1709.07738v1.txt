Given a probability measure on a finitely generated group, its Martin boundary is a way to compactify the group using the Green function of the corresponding random walk. It is known from the work of W. Woess that when a finitely supported random walk on a free product of abelian groups is adapted to the free product structure, the Martin boundary coincides with the geometric boundary. The main goal of this paper is to deal with non-adapted finitely supported random walks, for which there is no explicit formula for the Green function. Nevertheless, we show that the Martin boundary still coincides with the geometric boundary. We also prove that the Martin boundary is minimal.
