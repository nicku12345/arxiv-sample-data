New tilings of certain subsets of \mathbb{R}^{M} are studied, tilings associated with fractal blow-ups of certain similitude iterated function systems (IFS). For each such IFS with attractor satisfying the open set condition, our construction produces a usually infinite family of tilings that satisfy the following properties: (1) the prototile set is finite; (2) the tilings are repetitive (quasiperiodic); (3) each family contains self-similartilings, usually infinitely many; and (4) when the IFS is rigid in an appropriate sense, the tiling has no non-trivial symmetry; in particular the tiling is non-periodic.
