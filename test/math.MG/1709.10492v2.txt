In this paper we study the \Z/2 action on real Grassmann manifolds G_{n}(\R^{2n}) and \widetilde{G}_{n}(\R^{2n}) given by taking (appropriately oriented) orthogonal complement. We completely evaluate the related \Z/2 Fadell--Husseini index utilizing a novel computation of the Stiefel--Whitney classes of the wreath product of a vector bundle. These results are used to establish the following geometric result about the orthogonal shadows of a convex body: For n=2^a (2 b+1), k=2^{a+1}-1, C a convex body in \R^{2n}, and k real valued functions \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k continuous on convex bodies in \R^{2n} with respect to the Hausdorff metric, there exists a subspace V\subseteq\R^{2n} such that projections of C to V and its orthogonal complement V^{\perp} have the same value with respect to each function \alpha_i, which is \alpha_i (p_V(C))=\alpha_i (p_{V^\perp} (C)) for all 1\leq i\leq k.
