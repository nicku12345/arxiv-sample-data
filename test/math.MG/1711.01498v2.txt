This paper uses a connection between bounded remainder sets in \mathbb{R}^d and cut-and-project sets in \mathbb{R} together with the fact that each one-dimensional Pisot substitution sequence is bounded distance equivalent to some lattice in order to construct several bounded remainder sets with fractal boundary. Moreover it is shown that there are cut-and-project sets being not bounded distance equivalent to each other even if they are locally indistinguishable, more precisely: even if they are contained in the same hull.
