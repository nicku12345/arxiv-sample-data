Here we construct the conformal mappings with the help of continuous fractions approximations. These approximations converge to the algebraic roots \sqrt[N]{z} for N \in \mathbb{N} and z from the right half-plane of the complex plane. We estimate both the convergence rate and the compact set of convergence. Also we give the examples that illustrate the introduced technique of a conformal mapping construction.
