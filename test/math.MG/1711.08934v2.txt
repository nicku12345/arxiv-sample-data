For e \in S^{2}, the unit sphere in \mathbb{R}^3, let \pi_{e} be the orthogonal projection to e^{\perp} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}, and let W \subset \mathbb{R}^{3} be any 2-plane, which is not a subspace. We prove that if K \subset \mathbb{R}^{3} is a Borel set with \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \leq \tfrac{3}{2}, then \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \pi_{e}(K) = \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K for \mathcal{H}^{1} almost every e \in S^{2} \cap W, where \mathcal{H}^{1} denotes the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure and \dim_{\mathrm{H}} the Hausdorff dimension. This was known earlier, due to J\"arvenp\"a\"a, J\"arvenp\"a\"a, Ledrappier and Leikas, for Borel sets K \subset \mathbb{R}^{3} with \dim_{\mathrm{H}} K \leq 1. We also prove a partial result for sets with dimension exceeding 3/2, improving earlier bounds by D. Oberlin and R. Oberlin.
