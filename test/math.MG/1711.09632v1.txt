A new class of continuous valuations on the space of convex functions on \mathbb{R}^n is introduced. On smooth convex functions, they are defined for i=0,\dots,n by \begin{equation*} u\mapsto \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \zeta(u(x),x,\nabla u(x))\,[\operatorname{D}^2 u(x)]_i\,{\rm d} x \end{equation*} where \zeta\in C(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n) and [\operatorname{D}^2 u]_i is the ith elementary symmetric function of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, \operatorname{D}^2 u, of u. Under suitable assumptions on \zeta, these valuations are shown to be invariant under translations and rotations on convex and coercive functions.
