We provide a general framework for the study of valuations on Banach lattices. This complements and expands several recent works about valuations on function spaces, including L_p(\mu), Orlicz spaces and spaces C(K) of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. In particular, we study decomposition properties, boundedness and integral representation of continuous valuations.
