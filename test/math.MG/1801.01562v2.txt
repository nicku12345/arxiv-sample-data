Given a metric space X and a function f: X \to \mathbb{R}, the Reeb construction gives metric a space X_f together with a quotient map X \to X_f. Under suitable conditions X_f becomes a metric graph and can therefore be used as a graph approximation to X. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance from X_f to X is bounded by the half of the metric distortion of the quotient map. In this paper we consider the case where X is a compact Riemannian manifold and f is an excellent Morse function. In this case we provide bounds on the distortion of the quotient map which involve the first Betti number of the original space and a novel invariant which we call thickness.
