We consider some class of homeomorphisms of domains of Euclidean space, which are more general than quasiconformal mappings. For these homeomorphisms, we have obtained theorems on local behavior of it's inverse mappings in a given domain. Under some additional conditions, we proved results about behavior of mappings mentioned above in the closure of the domain.
