The following strengthening of the Elton-Odell theorem on the existence of a (1+\epsilon)-separated sequences in the unit sphere S_X of an infinite dimensional Banach space X is proved: There exists an infinite subset S\subseteq S_X and a constant d>1, satisfying the property that for every x,y\in S with x\neq y there exists f\in B_{X^*} such that d\leq f(x)-f(y) and f(y)\leq f(z)\leq f(x), for all z\in S.
