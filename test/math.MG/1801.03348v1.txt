Take a circle and mark n\in\mathbb{N} points on it designated as vertices. For any arc segment between two consecutive vertices which does not pass through any other vertex, there is a disk centered at its midpoint and has its end points on the boundary. We analyze intersection behaviour of these disks and show that the number of disjoint pairs among them is between \frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2} and \frac{n(n-3)}{2} and their intersection graph is a subgraph of a triangulation of a convex n-gon.
