Let U_1,U_2,\ldots be random points sampled uniformly and independently from the d-dimensional upper half-sphere. We show that, as n\to\infty, the f-vector of the (d+1)-dimensional convex cone C_n generated by U_1,\ldots,U_n weakly converges to a certain limiting random vector, without any normalization. We also show convergence of all moments of the f-vector of C_n and identify the limiting constants for the expectations. We prove that the expected Grassmann angles of C_n can be expressed through the expected f-vector. This yields convergence of expected Grassmann angles and conic intrinsic volumes and answers thereby a question of B\'ar\'any, Hug, Reitzner and Schneider [Random points in halfspheres, Rand. Struct. Alg., 2017]. Our approach is based on the observation that the random cone C_n weakly converges, after a suitable rescaling, to a random cone whose intersection with the tangent hyperplane of the half-sphere at its north pole is the convex hull of the Poisson point process with power-law intensity function proportional to \|x\|^{-(d+\gamma)}, where \gamma=1. We compute the expected number of facets, the expected intrinsic volumes and the expected T-functional of this random convex hull for arbitrary \gamma>0.
