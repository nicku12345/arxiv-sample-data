We prove an affine analog of Scharlau's reduction theorem for spherical buildings. To be a bit more precise let X be a euclidean building with spherical building \partial X at infinity. Then there exists a euclidean building \bar X such that X splits as a product of \bar X with some euclidean k-space such that \partial \bar X is the thick reduction of \partial X in the sense of Scharlau. \newline In addition we prove a converse statement saying that an embedding of a thick spherical building at infinity extends to an embedding of the euclidean building having the extended spherical building as its boundary.
