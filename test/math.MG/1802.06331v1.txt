For K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n a convex body with the origin o in its interior, and \phi:\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{o\}\rightarrow(0, \infty) a continuous function, define the general dual (L_{\phi}) Orlicz quermassintegral of K by \mathcal{V}_\phi(K)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n \setminus K} \phi(x)\,dx. Under certain conditions on \phi, we prove a variational formula for the general dual (L_{\phi}) Orlicz quermassintegral, which motivates the definition of \widetilde{C}_{\phi,\mathcal{V}}(K, \cdot), the general dual (L_{\phi}) Orlicz curvature measure of K.   We pose the following general dual Orlicz-Minkowski problem: {\it Given a nonzero finite Borel measure \mu defined on S^{n-1} and a continuous function \phi: \mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{o\}\rightarrow (0, \infty), can one find a constant \tau>0 and a convex body K (ideally, containing o in its interior), such that,} \mu=\tau\widetilde{C}_{\phi,\mathcal{V}}(K,\cdot)?  Based on the method of Lagrange multipliers and the established variational formula for the general dual (L_{\phi}) Orlicz quermassintegral, a solution to the general dual Orlicz-Minkowski problem is provided. In some special cases, the uniqueness of solutions is proved and the solution for \mu being a discrete measure is characterized.
