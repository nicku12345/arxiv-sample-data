The farthest point map sends a point in a compact metric space to the set of points farthest from it. We focus on the case when this metric space is a convex centrally symmetric polyhedron, so that we can compose the farthest point map with the antipodal map. The purpose of this work is to study the properties of this composition. We show that: 1. the map has no generalized periodic points; 2. its limit point set coincides with its generalized fixed point set; 3. each of its orbit converges; 4. its limit set is contained in a finite union of hyperbolas. We will define some of these terminologies in the article.
