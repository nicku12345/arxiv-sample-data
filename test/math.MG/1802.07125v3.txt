Extending the notion of bounded variation, a function u \in L_c^1(\mathbb R^n) is of bounded fractional variation with respect to some exponent \alpha if there is a finite constant C \geq 0 such that the estimate \[ \biggl|\int u(x) \det D(f,g_1,\dots,g_{n-1})_x \, dx\biggr| \leq C\operatorname{Lip}^\alpha(f) \operatorname{Lip}(g_1) \cdots \operatorname{Lip}(g_{n-1}) \] holds for all Lipschitz functions f,g_1,\dots,g_{n-1} on \mathbb R^n. Among such functions are characteristic functions of domains with fractal boundaries and H\"older continuous functions. We characterize functions of bounded fractional variation as a certain subspace of Whitney's flat chains and as multilinear functionals in the setting of Ambrosio-Kirchheim currents. Consequently we discuss extensions to H\"older differential forms, higher integrability, an isoperimetric inequality, a Lusin type property and change of variables. As an application we obtain sharp integrability results for Brouwer degree functions with respect to H\"older maps defined on domains with fractal boundaries.
