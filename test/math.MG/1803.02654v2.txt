In this paper we prove a general form of the Mass Transference Principle for \limsup sets defined via neighbourhoods of sets satisfying a certain local scaling property. Such sets include self-similar sets satisfying the open set condition and smooth compact manifolds embedded in \mathbb{R}^n. Our main result is applicable in locally compact metric spaces and allows one to transfer Hausdorff g-measure statements to Hausdorff f-measure statements. This work extends previous results of this type in several distinct directions.
