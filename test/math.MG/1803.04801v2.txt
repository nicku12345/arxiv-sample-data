Gr\"unbaum, Barnette, and Reay in 1974 completed the characterization of the pairs (f_i,f_j) of face numbers of 4-dimensional polytopes.   Here we obtain a complete characterization of the pairs of flag numbers (f_0,f_{03}) for 4-polytopes. Furthermore, we describe the pairs of face numbers (f_0,f_{d-1}) for d-polytopes; this description is complete for even d\ge6 except for finitely many exceptional pairs that are "small" in a well-defined sense, while for odd d we show that there are also "large" exceptional pairs.   Our proofs rely on the insight that "small" pairs need to be defined and to be treated separately; in the 4-dimensional case, these may be characterized with the help of the characterizations of the 4-polytopes with at most 8 vertices by Altshuler and Steinberg (1984).
