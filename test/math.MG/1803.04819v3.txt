A Semmes surface in the Heisenberg group is a closed set S that is upper Ahlfors-regular with codimension one and satisfies the following condition, referred to as Condition B. Every ball B(x,r) with x \in S and 0 < r < \operatorname{diam} S contains two balls with radii comparable to r which are contained in different connected components of the complement of S. Analogous sets in Euclidean spaces were introduced by Semmes in the late 80's. We prove that Semmes surfaces in the Heisenberg group are lower Ahlfors-regular with codimension one and have big pieces of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs. In particular, our result applies to the boundary of chord-arc domains and of reduced isoperimetric sets.
