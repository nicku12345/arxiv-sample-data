We discuss existence of factorizations with linear factors for (left) polynomials over certain associative real involutive algebras, most notably over Clifford algebras. Because of their relevance to kinematics and mechanism science, we put particular emphasis on factorization results for quaternion, dual quaternion and split quaternion polynomials. A general algorithm ensures existence of a factorization for generic polynomials over division rings but we also consider factorizations for non-division rings. We explain the current state of the art, present some new results and provide examples and counter examples.
