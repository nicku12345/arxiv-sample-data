We explore the distinctions between L^p convergence of metric tensors on a fixed Riemannian manifold versus Gromov-Hausdorff, uniform, and intrinsic flat convergence of the corresponding sequence of metric spaces. We provide a number of examples which demonstrate these notions of convergence do not agree even for two dimensional warped product manifolds with warping functions converging in the L^p sense. We then prove a theorem which requires L^p bounds from above and C^0 bounds from below on the warping functions to obtain enough control for all these limits to agree.
