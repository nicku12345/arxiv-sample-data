In this paper we prove that for any p\in[2,\infty) the \ell_p^n unit ball, B_p^n, satisfies the square negative correlation property with respect to every orthonormal basis, while we show it is not always the case for 1\le p\le 2. In order to do that we regard B_p^n as the orthogonal projection of B_p^{n+1} onto the hyperplane e_{n+1}^\perp. We will also study the orthogonal projection of B_p^n onto the hyperplane orthogonal to the diagonal vector (1,\dots,1). In this case, the property holds for all p\ge 1 and n large enough.
