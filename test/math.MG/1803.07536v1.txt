This article initiates a geometric study of the automorphism groups of general graph products of groups, and investigates the algebraic and geometric structure of automorphism groups of cyclic product of groups. For a cyclic product of at least five groups, we show that the action of the cyclic product on its Davis complex extends to an action of the whole automorphism group. This action allows us to completely compute the automorphism group and to derive several of its properties: Tits Alternative, acylindrical hyperbolicity, lack of property (T).
