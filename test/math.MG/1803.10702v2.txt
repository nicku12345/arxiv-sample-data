In an n-dimensional normed space every bounded set has a unique circumball if and only if every set of cardinality two has a unique circumball and if and only if the unit ball of the space is strictly convex. When the symmetry of the norm is dropped, i.e., when the centrally symmetric unit ball is replaced by an arbitrary convex body, then the above three conditions are no longer equivalent. We show for the latter case that every bounded set has a unique circumball if and only if every set of cardinality at most n has a unique circumball. We also give an equivalent condition in terms of the geometry of the unit ball. In similar terms we answer the following more general question for every k \in \{0,\ldots,n-2\}: When are the dimensions of the sets of all circumcenters of arbitrary bounded sets not larger than k?
