We prove the following rank rigidity result for proper CAT(0) spaces with one-dimensional Tits boundaries: Let \Gamma be a group acting properly discontinuously, cocompactly, and by isometries on such a space X. If the Tits diameter of \partial X equals \pi and \Gamma does not act minimally on \partial X, then \partial X is a spherical building or a spherical join. If X is also geodesically complete, then X is a Euclidean building, higher rank symmetric space, or a nontrivial product. Much of the proof, which involves finding a Tits-closed convex building-like subset of \partial X, does not require the Tits diameter to be \pi, and we give an alternate condition that guarantees rigidity when this hypothesis is removed, which is that a certain invariant of the group action be even.
