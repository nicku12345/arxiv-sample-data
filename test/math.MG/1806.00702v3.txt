We prove that the class of reflexive asymptotic-c_0 Banach spaces is coarsely rigid, meaning that if a Banach space X coarsely embeds into a reflexive asymptotic-c_0 space Y, then X is also reflexive and asymptotic-c_0. In order to achieve this result we provide a purely metric characterization of this class of Banach spaces. This metric characterization takes the form of a concentration inequality for Lipschitz maps on the Hamming graphs, which is rigid under coarse embeddings. Using an example of a quasi-reflexive asymptotic-c_0 space, we show that this concentration inequality is not equivalent to the non equi-coarse embeddability of the Hamming graphs.
