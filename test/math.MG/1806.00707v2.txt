We prove a sharp L^2\to H^{1/2} stability estimate for the geodesic X-ray transform of tensor fields of order 0, 1 and 2 on a simple Riemannian manifold with a suitable chosen H^{1/2} norm. We show that such an estimate holds for a family of such H^{1/2} norms, not topologically equivalent, but equivalent on the range of the transform. The reason for this is that the geodesic X-ray transform has a microlocally structured range.
