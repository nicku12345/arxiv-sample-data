We continue the study of optimal chordal packings, with emphasis on packing subspaces of dimension greater than one. Following a principle outlined in a previous work, where the authors use maximal affine block designs and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases to construct Grassmannian 2-designs, we show that their method extends to other types of block designs, leading to a plethora of optimal subspace packings characterized by the orthoplex bound. More generally, we show that any optimal chordal packing is necessarily a fusion frame and that its spatial complement is also optimal.
