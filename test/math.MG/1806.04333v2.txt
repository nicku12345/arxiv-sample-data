Let m,n\in\mathbb{N} and p\in(0,\infty). For a finite dimensional quasi-normed space X=(\mathbb{R}^m, \|\cdot\|_X), let B_p^n(X) = \Big\{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\big(\mathbb{R}^{m}\big)^n: \ \sum_{i=1}^n \|x_i\|_X^p \leq 1\Big\}. We show that for every p\in(0,2) and X which admits an isometric embedding into L_p, the function S^{n-1} \ni \theta = (\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n) \longmapsto \Big| B_p^n(X) \cap\Big\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in \big(\mathbb{R}^{m}\big)^n: \ \sum_{i=1}^n \theta_i x_i=0 \Big\} \Big| is a Schur convex function of (\theta_1^2,\ldots,\theta_n^2), where |\cdot| denotes Lebesgue measure. In particular, it is minimized when \theta=\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},\ldots,\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\big) and maximized when \theta=(1,0,\ldots,0). This is a consequence of a more general statement about Laplace transforms of norms of suitable Gaussian random vectors which also implies dual estimates for the mean width of projections of the polar body \big(B_p^n(X)\big)^\circ if the unit ball B_X of X is in Lewis' position. Finally, we prove a lower bound for the volume of projections of B_\infty^n(X), where X=(\mathbb{R}^m,\|\cdot\|_X) is an arbitrary quasi-normed space.
