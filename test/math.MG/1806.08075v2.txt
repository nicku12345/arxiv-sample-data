By a metric fractal we understand a compact metric space K endowed with a finite family \mathcal F of contracting self-maps of K such that K=\bigcup_{f\in\mathcal F}f(K). If K is a subset of a metric space X and each f\in\mathcal F extends to a contracting self-map of X, then we say that (K,\mathcal F) is a fractal in X. We prove that each metric fractal (K,\mathcal F) is   \bullet isometrically equivalent to a fractal in the Banach spaces C[0,1] and \ell_\infty;   \bullet bi-Lipschitz equivalent to a fractal in the Banach space c_0;   \bullet isometrically equivalent to a fractal in the Hilbert space \ell_2 if K is an ultrametric space.   We prove that for a metric fractal (K,\mathcal F) with the doubling property there exists k\in\mathbb N such that the metric fractal (K,\mathcal F^{\circ k}) endowed with the fractal structure \mathcal F^{\circ k}=\{f_1\circ\dots\circ f_k:f_1,\dots,f_k\in\mathcal F\} is equi-H\"older equivalent to a fractal in a Euclidean space \mathbb R^d. This result is used to prove our main result saying that each finite-dimensional compact metrizable space K containing an open uncountable zero-dimensional space Z is homeomorphic to a fractal in a Euclidean space \mathbb R^d. For Z, being a copy of the Cantor set, this embedding result was proved by Duvall and Husch in 1992.
