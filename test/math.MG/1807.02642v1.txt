We give some necessary conditions for maximality of 0/1-determinant. Let {\bf M} be a nondegenerate 0/1-matrix of order n. Denote by \bf A the matrix of order n+1 which appears from {\bf M} after adding the (n+1)th row (0,0,\ldots,0,1) and the (n+1)th column consisting of 1's. Suppose {\bf A}^{-1}=(l_{ij}), then for all i=1,\ldots,n we have \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} |l_{ij}|\geq 2. Moreover, if |\det({\bf M})| is equal to the maximum value of a 0/1-determinant of order n, then \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} |l_{ij}|= 2 for all i=1,\ldots,n.
