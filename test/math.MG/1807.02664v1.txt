The purpose of this note is to record a consequence, for general metric spaces, of a recent result of David Bate. We prove the following fact: Let X be a compact metric space of topological dimension n. Suppose that the n-dimensional Hausdorff measure of X, \mathcal H^n(X), is finite. Suppose further that the lower n-density of the measure \mathcal H^n is positive, \mathcal H^n-almost everywhere in X. Then X contains an n-rectifiable subset of positive \mathcal H^n-measure. Moreover, the assumption on the lower density is unnecessary if one uses recently announced results of Cs\"ornyei-Jones.
