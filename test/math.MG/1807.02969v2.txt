We show that a complete doubling metric space (X,d,\mu) supports a weak 1-Poincar\'e inequality if and only if it admits a pencil of curves (PC) joining any pair of points s,t \in X. This notion was introduced by S. Semmes in the 90's, and has been previously known to be a sufficient condition for the weak 1-Poincar\'e inequality.   Our argument passes through the intermediate notion of a generalised pencil of curves (GPC). A GPC joining s and t is a normal 1-current T, in the sense of Ambrosio and Kirchheim, with boundary \partial T = \delta_{t} - \delta_{s}, support contained in a ball of radius \sim d(s,t) around \{s,t\}, and satisfying \|T\| \ll \mu, with \frac{d\|T\|}{d\mu}(y) \lesssim \frac{d(s,y)}{\mu(B(s,d(s,y)))} + \frac{d(t,y)}{\mu(B(y,d(t,y)))}. We show that the 1-Poincar\'e inequality implies the existence of GPCs joining any pair of points in X. Then, we deduce the existence of PCs from a recent decomposition result for normal 1-currents due to Paolini and Stepanov.
