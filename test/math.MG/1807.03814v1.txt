Main results of the paper:   (1) For any finite metric space M the Lipschitz free space on M contains a large well-complemented subspace which is close to \ell_1^n.   (2) Lipschitz free spaces on large classes of recursively defined sequences of graphs are not uniformly isomorphic to \ell_1^n of the corresponding dimensions. These classes contain well-known families of diamond graphs and Laakso graphs.   Interesting features of our approach are: (a) We consider averages over groups of cycle-preserving bijections of graphs which are not necessarily graph automorphisms; (b) In the case of such recursive families of graphs as Laakso graphs we use the well-known approach of Gr\"unbaum (1960) and Rudin (1962) for estimating projection constants in the case where invariant projections are not unique.
