I propose an analogue in the first Heisenberg group \mathbb{H} of David and Semmes' local symmetry condition (LSC). For closed 3-regular sets E \subset \mathbb{H}, I show that the (LSC) is implied by the L^{2}(\mathcal{H}^{3}|_{E}) boundedness of 3-dimensional singular integrals with horizontally antisymmetric kernels, and that the (LSC) implies the weak geometric lemma for vertical \beta-numbers.
