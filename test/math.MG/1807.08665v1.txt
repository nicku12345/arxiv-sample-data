For a finite, strongly connected k-graph \Lambda, an Huef, Laca, Raeburn and Sims studied the KMS states associated to the preferred dynamics of the k-graph C^*-algebra C^*(\Lambda). They found that these KMS states are determined by the periodicity of \Lambda and a certain Borel probability measure M on the infinite path space \Lambda^\infty of \Lambda. Here we consider different dynamics on C^*(\Lambda), which arise from a functor y: \Lambda \to \mathbb{R}_+ and were first proposed by McNamara in his thesis. We show that the KMS states associated to McNamara's dynamics are again parametrized by the periodicity group of \Lambda and a family of Borel probability measures on the infinite path space. Indeed, these measures also arise as Hausdorff measures on \Lambda^\infty, and the associated Hausdorff dimension is intimately linked to the inverse temperatures at which KMS states exist. Our construction of the metrics underlying the Hausdorff structure uses the functors y: \Lambda \to \mathbb{R}_+; the stationary k-Bratteli diagram associated to \Lambda; and the concept of exponentially self-similar weights on Bratteli diagrams.
