We study hyperbolic polyhedral surfaces with faces isometric to regular hyperbolic polygons satisfying that the total angles at vertices are at least 2\pi. The combinatorial information of these surfaces is shown to be identified with that of Euclidean polyhedral surfaces with negative combinatorial curvature everywhere. We prove that there is a gap between areas of non-smooth hyperbolic polyhedral surfaces and the area of smooth hyperbolic surfaces. The numerical result for the gap is obtained for hyperbolic polyhedral surfaces, homeomorphic to the double torus, whose 1-skeletons are cubic graphs.
