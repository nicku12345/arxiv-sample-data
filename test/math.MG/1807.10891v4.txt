We are concerned with spectral problems of the Goldberg-Coxeter construction for 3- and 4-valent finite graphs. The Goldberg-Coxeter constructions \mathrm{GC}_{k,l}(X) of a finite 3- or 4-valent graph X are considered as "subdivisions" of X, whose number of vertices are increasing at order O(k^2+l^2), nevertheless which have bounded girth. It is shown that the first (resp. the last) o(k^2) eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian on \mathrm{GC}_{k,0}(X) tend to 0 (resp. tend to 6 or 8 in the 3- or 4-valent case, respectively) as k goes to infinity. A concrete estimate for the first several eigenvalues of \mathrm{GC}_{k,l}(X) by those of X is also obtained for general k and l. It is also shown that the specific values always appear as eigenvalues of \mathrm{GC}_{2k,0}(X) with large multiplicities almost independently to the structure of the initial X. In contrast, some dependency of the graph structure of X on the multiplicity of the specific values is also studied.
