Persistent homology has emerged as a novel tool for data analysis in the past two decades. However, there are still very few shapes or even manifolds whose persistent homology barcodes (say of the Vietoris-Rips complex) are fully known. Towards this direction, let P_n be the boundary of a regular polygon in the plane with n sides; we describe the homotopy types of Vietoris-Rips complexes of P_n. Indeed, when n=(k+1)!! is an odd double factorial, we provide a complete characterization of the homotopy types and persistent homology of the Vietoris-Rips complexes of P_n up to a scale parameter r_n, where r_n approaches the diameter of P_n as n\to\infty. Surprisingly, these homotopy types include spheres of all dimensions. Roughly speaking, the number of higher-dimensional spheres appearing is linked to the number of equilateral (but not necessarily equiangular) stars that can be inscribed into P_n. As our main tool we use the recently-developed theory of cyclic graphs and winding fractions. Furthermore, we show that the Vietoris-Rips complex of an arbitrarily dense subset of P_n need not be homotopy equivalent to the Vietoris-Rips complex of P_n itself, and indeed, these two complexes can have different homology groups in arbitrarily high dimensions. As an application of our results, we provide a lower bound on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between P_n and the circle.
