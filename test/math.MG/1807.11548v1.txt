We establish Marstrand-type projection theorems for orthogonal projections along geodesics onto m-dimensional subspaces of hyperbolic n-space by a geometric argument. Moreover, we obtain a Besicovitch-Federer type characterization of purely unrectifiable sets in terms of these hyperbolic orthogonal projections.
