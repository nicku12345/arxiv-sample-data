In this paper, we study extremal subsets in n-dimensional Alexandrov spaces with curvature \ge\kappa and diameter \le D. We show that the number of extremal subsets in an Alexandrov space, the Betti number of an extremal subset, and the volume of an extremal subset are uniformly bounded above by some constant depending only on n, \kappa and D. The proof is an application of essential coverings introduced by T. Yamaguchi.
