We propose to study the tropical geometry specifically arising from convergent Puiseux series in multiple indeterminates. One application is a new view on stable intersections of tropical hypersurfaces. Another one is the study of families of ordinary convex polytopes depending on more than one parameter through tropical geometry. This includes cubes constructed by Goldfarb and Sit (1979) as special cases.
