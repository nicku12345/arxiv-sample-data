We prove that the set of n-point configurations for which solution of the planar Steiner problem is not unique has Hausdorff dimension is at most 2n-1. Moreover, we show that the Hausdorff dimension of n-points configurations on which some locally minimal trees have the same length is also at most 2n-1. Methods we use essentially requires some analytic structure and some finiteness, so that we prove a similar result for a complete Riemannian analytic manifolds under some apriori assumption on the Steiner problem on them.
