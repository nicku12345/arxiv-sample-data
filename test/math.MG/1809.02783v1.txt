It is shown that a possibly irreversible C^2 Finsler metric on the torus, or on any other compact Euclidean space form, whose geodesics are straight lines is the sum of a flat metric and a closed 1-form. This is used to prove that if (M,g) is a compact Riemannian symmetric space of rank greater than one and F is a {\sl reversible} C^2 Finsler metric on M whose unparametrized geodesics coincide with those of g, then (M,F) is a Finsler symmetric space.
