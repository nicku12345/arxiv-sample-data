In Euclidean plane geometry, cycloids are curves which are homothetic to their respective bi-evolutes. In smooth normed planes, cycloids can be similarly defined, and they are characterized by their radius of curvature functions being solutions to eigenvalue problems of certain Sturm-Liouville equations. In this paper, we show that, for the eigenvalue {\lambda} = 1, this equation is a previously studied Hill equation which is closely related to the geometry given by the norm. We also investigate which geometric properties can be derived from this equation. Moreover, we prove that if the considered norm is defined by a Radon curve, then the solutions to the Hill equation are given by trigonometric functions. Further, we give conditions under which a given Hill equation induces a planar Minkowski geometry, and we prove that in this case the geometry is Euclidean if an eigenvalue other than {\lambda} = 1 induces a reparametrization of the original unit circle.
