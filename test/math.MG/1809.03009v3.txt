Using the duality of metric currents and polylipschitz forms, we show that a BLD-mapping f\colon X\to Y between oriented cohomology manifolds X and Y induces a pull-back operator f^\ast \colon M_{k,loc}(Y) \to M_{k,loc}(X) between the spaces of metric k-currents of locally finite mass. For proper maps, the pull-back is a right-inverse (up to multiplicity) of the push-forward f_\ast \colon M_{k,loc}(X)\to M_{k,loc}(Y). As an application we obtain a non-smooth version of the cohomological boundedness theorem of Bonk and Heinonen for locally Lipschitz contractible cohomology n-manifolds X admitting a BLD-mapping \mathbb{R}^n \to X.
