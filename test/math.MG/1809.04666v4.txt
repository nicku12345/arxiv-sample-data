We show that if B \subset \mathbb{R}^n and E \subset A(n,k) is a nonempty collection of k-dimensional affine subspaces of \mathbb{R}^n such that every P \in E intersects B in a set of Hausdorff dimension at least \alpha with k-1 < \alpha \leq k, then \dim B \geq \alpha +\dim E/(k+1), where \dim denotes the Hausdorff dimension. This estimate generalizes the well known Furstenberg-type estimate that every \alpha-Furstenberg set in the plane has Hausdorff dimension at least \alpha + 1/2.   More generally, we prove that if B and E are as above with 0 < \alpha \leq k, then \dim B \geq \alpha +(\dim E-(k-\lceil \alpha \rceil)(n-k))/(\lceil \alpha \rceil+1). We also show that this bound is sharp for some parameters.   As a consequence, we prove that for any 1 \leq k<n, the union of any nonempty s-Hausdorff dimensional family of k-dimensional affine subspaces of \mathbb{R}^n has Hausdorff dimension at least k+\frac{s}{k+1}.
