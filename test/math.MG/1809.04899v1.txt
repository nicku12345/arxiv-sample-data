Define the augmented square twist origami crease pattern to be the classic square twist crease pattern with one crease added along a diagonal of the twisted square. In this paper we fully describe the rigid foldability of this new crease pattern. Specifically, the extra crease allows the square twist to rigidly fold in ways the original cannot. We prove that there are exactly four non-degenerate rigid foldings of this crease pattern from the unfolded state.
