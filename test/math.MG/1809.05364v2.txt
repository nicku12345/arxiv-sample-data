In 2017 Barba, Pilz \& Schnider considered particular and modified cases of the following hyperplane measure partition problem: For the given collection of j measures on \mathbb R^d find a k-element affine hyperplane arrangement that bisects each of them into equal halves simultaneously. They solved the problem affirmatively in the case when d=k=2 and j=4. Furthermore, they conjectured that every collection of j measures on \mathbb R^d can be bisected with a k-element affine hyperplane arrangement provided that d\geq \lceil j/k \rceil. The conjecture was confirmed in the case when d\geq j/k=2^a by Hubard and Karasev in 2018.   In this paper we give a different proof of the Hubard and Karasev result using the framework of Blagojevi\'c, Frick, Haase \& Ziegler (2016), based on the equivariant relative obstruction theory, that was developed for handling the Gr\"unbaum--Hadwiger--Ramos hyperplane measure partition problem. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to prove even more, that for every collection of 2^a(2h+1)+\ell measures on \mathbb R^{2^a+\ell} there exists a (2h+1)-element affine hyperplane arrangement that bisects them simultaneously.
