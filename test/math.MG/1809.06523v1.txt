Diversities are a generalization of metric spaces in which a non-negative value is assigned to all finite subsets of a set, rather than just to pairs of points. Here we provide an analogue of the theory of negative type metrics for diversities. We introduce negative type diversities, and show that, as in the metric space case, they are a generalization of L_1-embeddable diversities. We provide a number of characterizations of negative type diversities, including a geometric characterisation. Much of the recent interest in negative type metrics stems from the connections between metric embeddings and approximation algorithms. We extend some of this work into the diversity setting, showing that lower bounds for embeddings of negative type metrics into L_1 can be extended to diversities by using recently established extremal results on hypergraphs.
