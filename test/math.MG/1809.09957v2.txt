We develop tools for proving isomorphisms of normed spaces of Lipschitz functions over various doubling metric spaces and Banach spaces. In particular, we show that \operatorname{Lip}_0(\mathbb{Z}^d)\simeq\operatorname{Lip}_0(\mathbb{R}^d), for all d\in\mathbb{N}. More generally, we e.g. show that \operatorname{Lip}_0(\Gamma)\simeq \operatorname{Lip}_0(G), where \Gamma is from a large class of finitely generated nilpotent groups and G is its Mal'cev closure; or that \operatorname{Lip}_0(\ell_p)\simeq\operatorname{Lip}_0(L_p), for all 1\leq p<\infty.   We leave a large area for further possible research.
