We introduce a graph structure on Euclidean polytopes. The vertices of this graph are the d-dimensional polytopes contained in \mathbb{R}^d and its edges connect any two polytopes that can be obtained from one another by either inserting or deleting a vertex, while keeping their vertex sets otherwise unaffected. We prove several results on the connectivity of this graph, and on a number of its subgraphs. We are especially interested in several families of subgraphs induced by lattice polytopes, such as the subgraphs induced by the lattice polytopes with n or n+1 vertices, that turn out to exhibit intriguing properties.
