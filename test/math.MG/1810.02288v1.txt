In this work we establish functional asymmetric versions of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. As consequences of these inequalities we recover their geometric counterparts with equality cases, as well as, another inequality with strong probabilistic flavour that was firstly obtained by Lutwak, Yang and Zhang. We present a brief study on an L_p functional analogue to the center of mass that is necessary for our arguments and that might be of independent interest.
