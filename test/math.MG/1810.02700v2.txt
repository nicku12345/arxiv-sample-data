In this paper, we construct H\"older maps to Carnot groups equipped with a Carnot metric, especially the first Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}. Pansu and Gromov observed that any surface embedded in \mathbb{H} has Hausdorff dimension at least 3, so there is no \alpha-H\"older embedding of a surface into \mathbb{H} when \alpha>\frac{2}{3}. Z\"ust improved this result to show that when \alpha>\frac{2}{3}, any \alpha-H\"older map from a simply-connected Riemannian manifold to \mathbb{H} factors through a metric tree. In the present paper, we show that Z\"ust's result is sharp by constructing (\frac{2}{3}-\epsilon)-H\"older maps from \mathbb{R}^2 and \mathbb{R}^3 to \mathbb{H} that do not factor through a tree. Indeed, our constructions lead to proper degree-1 maps from \mathbb{R}^3 to \mathbb{H} with H\"older exponents arbitrarily close to \frac{2}{3}.
