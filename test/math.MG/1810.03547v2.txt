We study the convex hulls of trajectories of polynomial dynamical systems. Such trajectories include real algebraic curves. The boundaries of the resulting convex bodies are stratified into families of faces. We present numerical algorithms for identifying these patches. An implementation based on the software Bensolve Tools is given. This furnishes a key step in computing attainable regions of chemical reaction networks.
