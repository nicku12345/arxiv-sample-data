We study the lower bound for Koldobsky's slicing inequality. We show that there exists a measure \mu and a symmetric convex body K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, such that for all \xi\in S^{n-1} and all t\in \mathbb{R}, \mu^+(K\cap(\xi^{\perp}+t\xi))\leq \frac{c}{\sqrt{n}}\mu(K)|K|^{-\frac{1}{n}}. Our bound is optimal, up to the value of the universal constant. It improves slightly upon the results of the first named author and Koldobsky which included a doubly-logarithmic error. The proof is based on an efficient way of discretizing the unit sphere.
