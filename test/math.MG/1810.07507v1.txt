Zhang's reverse affine isoperimetric inequality states that among all convex bodies K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n, the affine invariant quantity |K|^{n-1}|\Pi^*(K)| (where \Pi^*(K) denotes the polar projection body of K) is minimized if and only if K is a simplex. In this paper we prove an extension of Zhang's inequality in the setting of integrable log-concave functions, characterizing also the equality cases.
