We introduce the notion of controlled products on metric spaces as a generalization of Gromov products, and construct boundaries by using controlled products, which we call the Gromov boundaries. It is shown that the Gromov boundary with respect to a controlled product on a proper metric space complements the space as a coarse compactification. It is also shown that there is a bijective correspondence between the set of all coarse equivalence classes of controlled products and the set of all equivalence classes of coarse compactifications.
