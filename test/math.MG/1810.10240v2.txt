In this article, we show that some negative curvature may survive when taking the automorphism group of a finitely generated group. More precisely, we prove that the automorphism group \mathrm{Aut}(G) of a one-ended hyperbolic group G turns out to be acylindrically hyperbolic. As a consequence, given a group H and a morphism \varphi : H \to \mathrm{Aut}(G), we deduce that the semidirect product G \rtimes_\varphi H is acylindrically hyperbolic if and only if \mathrm{ker}(H \overset{\varphi}{\to} \mathrm{Aut}(G) \to \mathrm{Out}(G)) is finite.
