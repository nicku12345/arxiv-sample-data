We consider in this work triangulations of \mathbb{Z}^n that are periodic along \mathbb{Z}^n. They generalize the triangulations obtained from Delaunay tessellations of lattices. Other important property is the regularity and central-symmetry property of triangulations.   Full enumeration for dimension at most 4 is obtained. In dimension 5 several new phenomena happen: there are centrally-symmetric triangulations that are not Delaunay, there are non-regular triangulations (it could happen in dimension 4) and a given simplex has a priori an infinity of possible adjacent simplices. We found 950 periodic triangulations in dimension 5 but finiteness is unknown.
