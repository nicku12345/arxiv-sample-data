Let M^d be the spherical, Euclidean, or hyperbolic space of dimension d\ge n+1. Given any degenerate (n+1)-simplex \mathbf{A} in M^d with non-degenerate n-faces F_i, there is a natural partition of the set of n-faces into two subsets X_1 and X_2 such that \sum_{X_1}V_n(F_i)=\sum_{X_2}V_n(F_i), except for a special spherical case where X_2 is the empty set and \sum_{X_1}V_n(F_i)=V_n(\mathbb{S}^n) instead. For all cases, if the vertices vary smoothly in M^d with a \emph{single} volume constraint that \sum_{X_1}V_n(F_i)-\sum_{X_2}V_n(F_i) is preserved as a constant (0 or V_n(\mathbb{S}^n)), we prove that if a \emph{stress} invariant c_{n-1}(\alpha^{n-1}) of the degenerate simplex is non-zero, then the vertices will be confined to a lower dimensional M^n for any sufficiently small motion. This answers a question of the author and we also show that in the Euclidean case, c_{n-1}(\alpha^{n-1})=0 is equivalent to the vertices of a \emph{dual} degenerate (n+1)-simplex lying on an (n-1)-sphere in \mathbb{R}^n.
