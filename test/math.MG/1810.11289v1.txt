We prove that if (X,\mathsf d,\mathfrak m) is an essentially non-branching metric measure space with \mathfrak m(X)=1, having Ricci curvature bounded from below by K and dimension bounded from above by N \in (1,\infty), understood as a synthetic condition called Measure-Contraction property, then a sharp isoperimetric inequality \`a la L\'evy-Gromov holds true. Measure theoretic rigidity is also obtained.
