Given a metric measure space (X,d,\mathfrak{m}) that satisfies the Riemannian Curvature Dimension condition, RCD^*(K,N), and a compact subgroup of isometries G \leq Iso(X) we prove that there exists a G-invariant measure, \mathfrak{m}_G, equivalent to \mathfrak{m} such that (X,d,\mathfrak{m}_G) is still a RCD^*(K,N) space. We also obtain some applications to Lie group actions on RCD^*(K,N) spaces. We look at homogeneous spaces, symmetric spaces and obtain dimensional gaps for closed subgroups of isometries.
