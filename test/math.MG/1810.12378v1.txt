In this paper we produce a sequence of Riemannian manifolds M_j^m, m \ge 2, which converge in the intrinsic flat sense to the unit m-sphere with the restricted Euclidean distance. This limit space has no geodesics achieving the distances between points, exhibiting previously unknown behavior of intrinsic flat limits. In contrast, any compact Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of Riemannian manifolds is a geodesic space. Moreover, if m\geq3, the manifolds M_j^m may be chosen to have positive scalar curvature.
