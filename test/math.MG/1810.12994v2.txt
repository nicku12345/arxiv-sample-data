The large-scale geometry of hyperbolic metric spaces exhibits many distinctive features, such as the stability of quasi-geodesics (the Morse Lemma), the visibility property, and the homeomorphism between visual boundaries induced by a quasi-isometry. We prove a number of closely analogous results for spaces of rank n \ge 2 in an asymptotic sense, under some weak assumptions reminiscent of nonpositive curvature. For this purpose we replace quasi-geodesic lines with quasi-minimizing (locally finite) n-cycles of r^n volume growth; prime examples include n-cycles associated with n-quasiflats. Solving an asymptotic Plateau problem and producing unique tangent cones at infinity for such cycles, we show in particular that every quasi-isometry between two proper CAT(0) spaces of asymptotic rank n extends to a class of (n-1)-cycles in the Tits boundaries.
