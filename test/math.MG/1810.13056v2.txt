We examine volume pinching problems of CAT(1) spaces. We characterize a class of compact geodesically complete CAT(1) spaces of small specific volume. We prove a sphere theorem for compact CAT(1) homology manifolds of small volume. We also formulate a criterion of manifold recognition for homology manifolds on volume growths under an upper curvature bound.
