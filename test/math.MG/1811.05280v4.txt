We show that closed arithmetic hyperbolic n-dimensional orbifolds with larger and larger volumes give rise to triangulations of the underlying spaces whose 1-skeletons are harder and harder to embed nicely in Euclidean space. To show this we generalize an inequality of Gromov and Guth to hyperbolic n-orbifolds and find nearly optimal geodesic triangulations of arithmetic hyperbolic n-orbifolds.
