In this manuscript, we study the inequalities between measures of convex bodies implied by comparison of their projections and sections. Recently, Giannopoulos and Koldobsky proved that if convex bodies K, L satisfy |K|\theta^{\perp}| \le |L \cap \theta^{\perp}| for all \theta \in S^{n-1}, then |K| \le |L|. Firstly, we study the reverse question: in particular, we show that if K, L are origin-symmetric convex bodies in John's position with |K \cap \theta^{\perp}| \le |L|\theta^{\perp}| for all \theta \in S^{n-1} then |K| \le \sqrt{n}|L|. The condition we consider is weaker than both the conditions |K \cap \theta^{\perp}| \le |L \cap \theta^{\perp}| and |K|\theta^{\perp}| \le |L|\theta^{\perp}| for all \theta \in S^{n-1} that appear in the Busemann-Petty and Shephard problems respectively. Secondly, we appropriately extend the result of Giannopoulos and Koldobsky to various classes of measures possessing concavity properties, including log-concave measures.
