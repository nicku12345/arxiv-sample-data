We classify all subsets S of the projective Hilbert space with the following property: for every point \pm s_0\in S, the spherical projection of S\backslash\{\pm s_0\} to the hyperplane orthogonal to \pm s_0 is isometric to S\backslash\{\pm s_0\}. In probabilistic terms, this means that we characterize all zero-mean Gaussian processes Z=(Z(t))_{t\in T} with the property that for every s_0\in T the conditional distribution of (Z(t))_{t\in T} given that Z(s_0)=0 coincides with the distribution of (\varphi(t; s_0) Z(t))_{t\in T} for some function \varphi(t;s_0). A basic example of such process is the stationary zero-mean Gaussian process (X(t))_{t\in\mathbb R} with covariance function \mathbb E [X(s) X(t)] = 1/\cosh (t-s). We show that, in general, the process Z can be decomposed into a union of mutually independent processes of two types: (i) processes of the form (a(t) X(\psi(t)))_{t\in T}, with a: T\to \mathbb R, \psi(t): T\to \mathbb R, and (ii) certain exceptional Gaussian processes defined on four-point index sets. The above problem is reduced to the classification of metric spaces in which in every triangle the largest side equals the sum of the remaining two sides.
