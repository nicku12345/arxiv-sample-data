We prove (Theorem 2.4) that the symmetrized deleted join SymmDelJoin(\mathcal{K}) of a "balanced family" \mathcal{K} = \langle K_i\rangle_{i=1}^r of collectively r-unavoidable subcomplexes of 2^{[m]} is (m-r-1)-connected. As a consequence we obtain a Tverberg-Van Kampen-Flores type result (Theorem 3.2) which is more conceptual and more general then previously known results. Already the case r=2 of Theorem 3.2 seems to be new as an extension of the classical Van Kampen-Flores theorem. The main tool used in the paper is R. Forman's discrete Morse theory.
