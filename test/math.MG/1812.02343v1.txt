In 1945-46, C. L. Siegel proved that an n-dimensional lattice \Lambda  of determinant {\rm det}(\Lambda ) has at most m^{n^2} different sublattices of determinant m\cdot {\rm det}(\Lambda ). In 1997, the exact number of the different sublattices of index m was determined by Baake. This paper presents a systematic treatment for counting the sublattices and deduces a formula for the number of the sublattice classes of determinant m\cdot {\rm det}(\Lambda ).
