In a recent paper Garber, Gavrilyuk and Magazinov proposed a sufficient combinatorial condition for a parallelohedron to be affinely Voronoi. We show that this condition holds for all five-dimensional Voronoi parallelohedra. Consequently, the Voronoi conjecture in \mathbb R^5 holds if and only if every five-dimensional parallelohedron is combinatorially Voronoi. Here, by saying that a parallelohedron P is combinatorially Voronoi, we mean that the tiling \mathcal T(P) by translates of P is combinatorially isomorphic to some tiling \mathcal T(P'), where P' is a Voronoi parallelohedron, and that the isomorphism naturally induces a linear isomorphism of lattices \Lambda(P) and \Lambda(P').   We also propose a new sufficient condition implying that a parallelohedron is affinely Voronoi. The condition is based on the new notion of the Venkov complex associated with a parallelohedron.
