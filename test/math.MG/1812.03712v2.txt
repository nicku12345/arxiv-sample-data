In this paper we study the family of embeddings \Phi_t of a compact RCD^*(K,N) space (X,d,m) into L^2(X,m) via eigenmaps. Extending part of the classical results by B\'erard, B\'erard-Besson-Gallot, known for closed Riemannian manifolds, we prove convergence as t\downarrow 0 of the rescaled pull-back metrics \Phi_t^*g_{L^2} in L^2(X,m) induced by \Phi_t. Moreover we discuss the behavior of \Phi_t^*g_{L^2} with respect to measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and t. Applications include the quantitative L^p-convergence in the noncollapsed setting for all p<\infty, a result new even for closed Riemannian manifolds and Alexandrov spaces.
