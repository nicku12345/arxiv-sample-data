In this paper, a general approach is presented for generalizing the Gromov-Hausdorff metric to consider metric spaces equipped with some additional structure. A special case is the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov metric which considers measured metric spaces. This abstract framework also unifies several existing generalizations which consider metric spaces equipped with a measure, a point, a closed subset, a curve or a tuple of such structures. It can also be useful for studying new examples of additional structures. The framework is provided both for compact metric spaces and for boundedly-compact pointed metric spaces. In addition, completeness and separability of the metric is proved under some conditions. This enables one to study random metric spaces equipped with additional structures, which is the main motivation of this work.
