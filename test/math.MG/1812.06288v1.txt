A set of n points in the Euclidean plane determines at least n distinct lines unless these n points are collinear. In 2006, Chen and Chv\'atal asked whether the same statement holds true in general metric spaces, where the line determined by points x and y is defined as the set consisting of x, y, and all points z such that one of the three points x,y,z lies between the other two. The conjecture that it does hold true remains unresolved even in the special case where the metric space arises from a connected undirected graph with unit lengths assigned to edges. We trace its curriculum vitae and point out twenty-nine related open problems plus three additional conjectures.
