An S-hypersimplex for S \subseteq \{0,1, \dots,d\} is the convex hull of all 0/1-vectors of length d with coordinate sum in S. These polytopes generalize the classical hypersimplices as well as cubes, crosspolytopes, and halfcubes. In this paper we study faces and dissections of S-hypersimplices. Moreover, we show that monotone path polytopes of S-hypersimplices yield all types of multipermutahedra. In analogy to cubes, we also show that the number of simplices in a pulling triangulation of a halfcube is independent of the pulling order.
