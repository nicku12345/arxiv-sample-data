In this note we prove the Borel Conjecture for closed, irreducible and sufficiently collapsed three-dimensional Alexandrov spaces. We also pose several questions related to characterization of fundamental groups of three-dimensional Alexandrov spaces, finite groups acting on them and rigidity results.
