The largest volume ratio of given convex body K \subset \mathbb{R}^n is defined as \mbox{lvr}(K):= \sup_{L \subset \mathbb{R}^n} \mbox{vr}(K,L), where the \sup runs over all the convex bodies L.   We prove the following sharp lower bound c \sqrt{n} \leq \mbox{lvr}(K), for every body K (where c>0 is an absolute constant). This result improves the former best known lower bound, of order \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log \log(n)}}.   We also study the exact asymptotic behavior of the largest volume ratio for some natural classes. In particular, we show that \mbox{lvr}(K) behaves as the square root of the dimension of the ambient space in the following cases: if K is the unit ball of an unitary invariant norm in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} (e.g., the unit ball of the p-Schatten class S_p^d for any 1 \leq p \leq \infty), K is the the unit ball of the full/symmetric tensor product of \ell_p-spaces endowed with the projective or injective norm or K is unconditional.
