For a collection of N unit vectors \mathbf{X}=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N, define the p-frame energy of \mathbf{X} as the quantity \sum_{i\neq j} |\langle x_i,x_j \rangle|^p. In this paper, we connect the problem of minimizing this value to another optimization problem, so giving new lower bounds for such energies. In particular, for p<2, we prove that this energy is at least 2(N-d) p^{-\frac p 2} (2-p)^{\frac {p-2} 2} which is sharp for d\leq N\leq 2d and p=1. We prove that for 1\leq m<d, a repeated orthonormal basis construction of N=d+m vectors minimizes the energy over an interval, p\in[1,p_m], and demonstrate an analogous result for all N in the case d=2. Finally, in connection, we give conjectures on these and other energies.
