We use the geometric structure of the hyperbolic upper half plane to provide a new proof of the Avalanche Principle introduced by M. Goldstein and W. Schlag in the context of \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R}) matrices. This approach allows to interpret and extend this result to arbitrary \mathrm{CAT}(-1) metric spaces. Through the proof, we deduce a polygonal Schur theorem for these spaces.
