While the problem of determining whether an embedding of a graph G in \mathbb{R}^2 is {\it infinitesimally rigid} is well understood, specifying whether a given embedding of G is {\it rigid} or not is still a hard task that usually requires ad hoc arguments. In this paper, we show that {\it every} embedding (not necessarily generic) of a dense enough graph (concretely, a graph with at least C_0n^{3/2}\log n edges, for some absolute constant C_0>0), which satisfies some very mild general position requirements (no three vertices of G are embedded to a common line), must have a subframework of size at least three which is rigid. For the proof we use a connection, established in Raz [Ra], between the notion of graph rigidity and configurations of lines in \mathbb{R}^3. This connection allows us to use properties of line configurations established in Guth and Katz [GK2]. In fact, our proof requires an extended version of Guth and Katz result; the extension we need is proved by J\'anos Koll\'ar in an Appendix to our paper.   We do not know whether our assumption on the number of edges being \Omega(n^{3/2}\log n) is tight, and we provide a construction that shows that requiring \Omega(n\log n) edges is necessary.
