We consider the integer point transform \sigma _P (\mathbf{x}) = \sum _{\mathbf{m} \in P\cap \mathbb{Z}^n} \mathbf{x}^\mathbf{m} \in \mathbb C [x_1^{\pm 1},\ldots, x_n^{\pm 1}] of a polytope P\subset \mathbb{R}^n. We show that if P is a lattice polytope then for any polytope Q the sequence \lbrace \sigma _{kP+Q}(\mathbf{x})\rbrace _{k\geq 0} satisfies a multivariate linear recursion that only depends on the vertices of P. We recover Brion's Theorem and by applying our results to Schur polynomials we disprove a conjecture of Alexandersson (2014).
