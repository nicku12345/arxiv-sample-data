We study the deformation of spherical conical metrics with at least some of the cone angles larger than 2\pi. We show in this note via synthetic geometry that for one family of such metrics, there is local rigidity in the choice of cone positions if angles are fixed. This gives an evidence of the analytic obstruction considered in recent works of Mazzeo and author.
