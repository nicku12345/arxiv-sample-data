Let F \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}, and let \dim_{\mathrm{A}} stand for Assouad dimension. I prove that \dim_{\mathrm{A}} \pi_{e}(F) \geq \min\{\dim_{\mathrm{A}} F,1\} for all e \in S^{1} outside of a set of Hausdorff dimension zero. This is a strong variant of Marstrand's projection theorem for Assouad dimension, whose analogue is not true for other common notions of fractal dimension, such as Hausdorff or packing dimension.
