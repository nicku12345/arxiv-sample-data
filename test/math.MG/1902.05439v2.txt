We study finite groups that occur as combinatorial automorphism groups or geometric symmetry groups of convex polytopes. When \Gamma is a subgroup of the combinatorial automorphism group of a convex d-polytope, d\geq 3, then there exists a convex d-polytope related to the original polytope with combinatorial automorphism group exactly \Gamma. When \Gamma is a subgroup of the geometric symmetry group of a convex d-polytope, d\geq 3, then there exists a convex d-polytope related to the original polytope with both geometric symmetry group and combinatorial automorphism group exactly \Gamma. These symmetry-breaking results then are applied to show that for every abelian group \Gamma of even order and every involution \sigma of \Gamma, there is a centrally symmetric convex polytope with geometric symmetry group \Gamma such that \sigma corresponds to the central symmetry.
