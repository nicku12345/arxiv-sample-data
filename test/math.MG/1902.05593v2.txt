Let X be a finite-dimensional Banach space; we introduce and investigate a natural generalization of the concepts of Hadwiger number H(X) and strict Hadwiger number H'(X). More precisely, we define the antipodal Hadwiger number H_\alpha(X) as the largest cardinality of a subset S \subseteq S_X, such that \forall x \neq y \in S \,\,\, \exists f \in B_{X^*} with \[1 \le f(x)-f(y) \,\,\, \textrm{and} \,\,\, f(y) \le f(z) \le f(x) \,\,\, \textrm{for} \,\,\, z \in S.\] The strict antipodal Hadwiger number H'_\alpha(X) is defined analogously. We prove that H'_\alpha(X)=4 for every Minkowski plane and estimate (or in some cases compute) the numbers H_\alpha(X) and H'_\alpha(X), where X=\ell_p^n, 1 < p \le +\infty and n \ge 2. We also show that the number H'_\alpha(X) grows exponentially in \dim X.
