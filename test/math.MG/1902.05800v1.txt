In this article, we consider some generalizations of polynomial and exponential B-splines. Firstly, the extension from integral to complex orders is reviewed and presented. The second generalization involves the construction of uncountable families of self-referential or fractal functions from polynomial and exponential B-splines of integral and complex orders. As the support of the latter B-splines is the set [0,\infty), the known fractal interpolation techniques are extended in order to include this setting.
