We obtain an equivariant classification for orientable, closed, four-dimensional Alexandrov spaces admitting an isometric torus action. This generalizes the equivariant classification of Orlik and Raymond of closed four-dimensional manifolds with torus actions. We also obtain a partial homeomorphism classification.
