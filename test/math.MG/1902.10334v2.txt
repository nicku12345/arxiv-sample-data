The paper is devoted to the geometry of transportation cost spaces and their generalizations introduced by Melleray, Petrov, and Vershik (2008). Transportation cost spaces are also known as Arens-Eells, Lipschitz-free, or Wasserstein 1 spaces. In this work, the existence of metric spaces with the following properties is proved: (1) uniformly discrete infinite metric spaces transportation cost spaces on which do not contain isometric copies of \ell_1, this result answers a question raised by Cuth and Johanis (2017); (2) locally finite metric spaces which admit isometric embeddings only into Banach spaces containing isometric copies of \ell_1; (3) metric spaces for which the double-point norm is not a norm. In addition, it is proved that the double-point norm spaces corresponding to trees are close to \ell_\infty^d of the corresponding dimension, and that for all finite metric spaces M, except a very special class, the infimum of all seminorms for which the embedding of M into the corresponding seminormed space is isometric, is not a seminorm.
