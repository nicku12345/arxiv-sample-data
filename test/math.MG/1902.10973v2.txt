We prove the generalized Margulis lemma with a uniform index bound on an Alexandrov n-space X with curvature bounded below, i.e., small loops at p\in X generate a subgroup of the fundamental group of unit ball B_1(p) that contains a nilpotent subgroup of index \le w(n), where w(n) is a constant depending only on the dimension n. The proof is based on the main ideas of V.~Kapovitch, A.~Petrunin, and W.~Tuschmann, and the following results:   (1) We prove that any regular almost Lipschitz submersion constructed by Yamaguchi on a collapsed Alexandrov space with curvature bounded below is a Hurewicz fibration. We also prove that such fibration is uniquely determined up to a homotopy equivalence.   (2) We give a detailed proof on the gradient push, improving the universal pushing time bound given by V.~Kapovitch, A.~Petrunin, and W.~Tuschmann, and justifying in a specific way that the gradient push between regular points can always keep away from extremal subsets.
