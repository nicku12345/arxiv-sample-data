Let E be a Bedford-McMullen carpet associated with a set of affine mappings \{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G} and let \mu be the self-affine measure associated with \{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G} and a probability vector (p_{ij})_{(i,j)\in G}. We study the asymptotics of the geometric mean error in the quantization for \mu. Let s_0 be the Hausdorff dimension for \mu. Assuming a separation condition for \{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G}, we prove that the nth geometric error for \mu is of the same order as n^{-1/s_0}.
