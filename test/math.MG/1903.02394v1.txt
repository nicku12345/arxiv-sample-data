Let A be an n\times n real expanding matrix and \mathcal{D} be a finite subset of \mathbb{R}^n with 0\in\mathcal{D}. The family of maps \{f_d(x)=A^{-1}(x+d)\}_{d\in\mathcal{D}} is called a self-affine iterated function system (self-affine IFS). The self-affine set K=K(A,\mathcal{D}) is the unique compact set determined by (A, {\mathcal D}) satisfying the set-valued equation K=\displaystyle\bigcup_{d\in\mathcal{D}}f_d(K). The number s=n\,\ln(\# \mathcal{D})/\ln(q) with q=|\det(A)|, is the so-called pseudo similarity dimension of K. As shown by He and Lau, one can associate with A and any number s\ge 0 a natural pseudo Hausdorff measure denoted by \mathcal{H}_w^s. In this paper, we show that, if s is chosen to be the pseudo similarity dimension of K, then the condition \mathcal{H}_w^s(K)> 0 holds if and only if the IFS \{f_d\}_{d\in\mathcal{D}} satisfies the open set condition (OSC). This extends the well-known result for the self-similar case that the OSC is equivalent to K having positive Hausdorff measure \mathcal{H}^s for a suitable s. Furthermore, we relate the exact value of pseudo Hausdorff measure \mathcal{H}_w^s(K) to a notion of upper s-density with respect to the pseudo norm w(x) associated with A for the measure \mu=\lim\limits_{M\to\infty}\sum\limits_{d_0,\dotsc,d_{M-1}\in\mathcal{D}}\delta_{d_0 + Ad_1 + \dotsb + A^{M-1}d_{M-1}} in the case that \#\mathcal{D}\le\lvert\det A\rvert.
