All non-negative, continuous, \operatorname{SL}(n) and translation invariant valuations on the space of super-coercive, convex functions on \mathbb{R}^n are classified. Furthermore, using the invariance of the function space under the Legendre transform, a classification of non-negative, continuous, \operatorname{SL}(n) and dually translation invariant valuations is obtained. In both cases, different functional analogs of the Euler characteristic, volume and polar volume are characterized.
