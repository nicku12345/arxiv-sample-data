The Regge symmetry is a set of remarkable relations between two tetrahedra whose edge lengths are related in a simple fashion. It was first discovered as a consequence of an asymptotic formula in mathematical physics. Here we give a simple geometric proof of Regge symmetries in Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry.
