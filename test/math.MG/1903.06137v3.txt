We define a partition \mathcal{P}_0 and a \mathbb{Z}^2-rotation (\mathbb{Z}^2-action defined by rotations) on a 2-dimensional torus whose associated symbolic dynamical system is a minimal proper subshift of the Jeandel-Rao aperiodic Wang shift defined by 11 Wang tiles. We define another partition \mathcal{P}_\mathcal{U} and a \mathbb{Z}^2-rotation on \mathbb{T}^2 whose associated symbolic dynamical system is equal to a minimal and aperiodic Wang shift defined by 19 Wang tiles. This proves that \mathcal{P}_\mathcal{U} is a Markov partition for the \mathbb{Z}^2-rotation on \mathbb{T}^2. We prove in both cases that the toral \mathbb{Z}^2-rotation is the maximal equicontinuous factor of the minimal subshifts and that the set of fiber cardinalities of the factor map is \{1,2,8\}. The two minimal subshifts are uniquely ergodic and are isomorphic as measure-preserving dynamical systems to the toral \mathbb{Z}^2-rotations. It provides a construction of these Wang shifts as model sets of 4-to-2 cut and project schemes. A do-it-yourself puzzle is available in the appendix to illustrate the results.
