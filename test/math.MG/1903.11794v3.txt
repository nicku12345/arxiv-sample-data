In this article, we study the magnitude homology of geodesic metric spaces of curvature \leq \kappa, especially {\rm CAT}(\kappa) spaces. We will show that the magnitude homology MH^{l}_{n}(X) of such a meric space X vanishes for small l and all n > 0. Conseqently, we can compute a total \mathbb{Z}-degree magnitude homology for small l for the shperes \mathbb{S}^{n}, the Euclid spaces \mathbb{E}^{n}, the hyperbolic spaces \mathbb{H}^{n}, and real projective spaces \mathbb{RP}^{n} with the standard metric. We also show that an existence of closed geodesic in a metric space guarantees the non-triviality of magnitude homology.
