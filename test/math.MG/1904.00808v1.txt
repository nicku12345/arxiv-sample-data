Suppose that (X,d,\mu) is a metric measure space of finite Hausdorff dimension and that, for every Lipschitz f \colon X \to \mathbb R, \operatorname{Lip}(f,\cdot) is dominated by every upper gradient of f. We show that X is a Lipschitz differentiability space, and the differentiable structure of X has dimension at most \dim_{\mathrm{H}} X. Since our assumptions are satisfied whenever X is doubling and satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality, we thus obtain a new proof of Cheeger's generalisation of Rademacher's theorem.   Our approach uses Guth's multilinear Kakeya inequality for neighbourhoods of Lipschitz graphs to show that any non-trivial measure with n independent Alberti representations has Hausdorff dimension at least n.
