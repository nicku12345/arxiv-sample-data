We establish the sharp rate of continuity of extensions of \mathbb{R}^m-valued 1-Lipschitz maps from a subset A of \mathbb{R}^n to a 1-Lipschitz maps on \mathbb{R}^n. We consider several cases when there exists an extension with preserved Lipschitz constant and preserved uniform distance to a given 1-Lipschitz map. We prove that if m>1 then a given map is 1-Lipschitz and affine if and only if such extension exists for any 1-Lipschitz map defined on any subset of \mathbb{R}^n. This shows a striking difference from the case m=1, where any 1-Lipschitz function has such property. Another example where we prove it is possible to find an extension with the same Lipschitz constant and the same uniform distance to another Lipschitz map v is when the difference between the two maps belongs to a fixed one-dimensional subspace of \mathbb{R}^m and the set A is geodesically convex with respect to a Riemannian pseudo-metric associated with v.
