For two discrete metric spaces, X and Y we consider metrics on X\sqcup Y compatible with the metrics on X and Y. As morphisms from X to Y we consider the Roe bimodules, i.e. the norm closures of bounded finite propagation operators from l^2(X) to l^2(Y). We study the corresponding category \mathcal M, which is also a 2-category. We show that almost isometries determine morphisms in \mathcal M. We also consider the case Y=X, when there is a richer algebraic structure on the set of morphisms of \mathcal M: it is a partially ordered semigroup with the neutral element, with involution, and with a lot of idempotents. We also give a condition when a morphism is a C^*-algebra.
