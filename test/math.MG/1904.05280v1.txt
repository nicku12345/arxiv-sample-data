As a discrete counterpart to the classical John theorem on the approximation of (symmetric) n-dimensional convex bodies K by ellipsoids, Tao and Vu introduced so called generalized arithmetic progressions P(A,b)\subset Z^n in order to cover (many of) the lattice points inside a convex body by a simple geometric structure. Among others, they proved that there exists a generalized arithmetic progressions P(A,b) such that P(A,b)\subset K\cap Z^n\subset P(A,O(n)^{3n/2}b). Here we show that this bound can be lowered to n^{O(\ln n)} and study some general properties of so called unimodular generalized arithmetic progressions.
