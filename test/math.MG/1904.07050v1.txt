In this paper, we characterize when the \ell^p uniform Roe algebra of a metric space with bounded geometry is (stably) finite and when it is properly infinite in standard form for p\in [1,\infty). Moreover, we show that the \ell^p uniform Roe algebra is a (non-sequential) spatial L^p AF algebra in the sense of Phillips and Viola if and only if the underlying metric space has asymptotic dimension zero.   We also consider the ordered K_0 groups of \ell^p uniform Roe algebras for metric spaces with low asymptotic dimension, showing that (1) the ordered K_0 group is trivial when the metric space is non-amenable and has asymptotic dimension at most one, and (2) when the metric space is a countable locally finite group, the (ordered) K_0 group is a complete invariant for the (bijective) coarse equivalence class of the underlying locally finite group. It happens that in both cases the ordered K_0 group does not depend on p\in [1,\infty).
