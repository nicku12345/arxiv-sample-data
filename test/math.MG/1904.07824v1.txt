It is known that the surface of a cone over the unit disc with large height has smaller distortion than the standard embedding of the 2-sphere in \mathbb R^3. In this note we show that distortion minimisers exist among convex embedded 2-spheres and have uniformly bounded eccentricity. Moreover, we prove that \pi/2 is a sharp lower bound on the distortion of embedded closed surfaces of positive genus.
