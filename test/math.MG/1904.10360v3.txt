We determine the order of magnitude of the nth \ell_p-polarization constant of the unit sphere S^{d-1} for every n,d \geq 1 and p>0. For p=2, we prove that extremizers are isotropic vector sets, whereas for p=1, we show that the polarization problem is equivalent to that of maximizing the norm of signed vector sums. Finally, for d=2, we discuss the optimality of equally spaced configurations on the unit circle.
