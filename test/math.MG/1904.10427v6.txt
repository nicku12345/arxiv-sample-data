Given L a convex body, the L_p-Busemann Random Simplex Inequality is closely related to the centroid body \Gamma_p L for p=1 and 2, and only in these cases it can be proved using the L_p-Busemann-Petty centroid inequality. We define a convex body N_p L and prove an isoperimetric inequality for (N_p L)^\circ that is equivalent to the L_p-Busemann Random Simplex Inequality. As applications, we give a simple proof of a general functional version of the Busemann Random Simplex Inequality and study a dual theory related to Petty's conjectured inequality. More precisely, we prove dual versions of the L_p-Busemann Random Simplex Inequality for sets and functions by means of the p-affine surface area measure, and we prove that the Petty conjecture is equivalent to an L_1-Sharp Affine Sobolev-type inequality that is stronger than (and directly implies) the Sobolev-Zhang inequality.
