Let M^n be a closed immersed hypersurface lying in a contractible ball B(p,R) of the ambient (n+1)-manifold N^{n+1}. We prove that, by pinching Heintze-Reilly's inequality via sectional curvature upper bound of B(p,R), 1st eigenvalue and mean curvature of M, not only M is Hausdorff close to a geodesic sphere S(p_0,R_0) in N, but also the ``enclosed'' ball B(p_0,R_0) is close to be of constant curvature, provided with a uniform control on the volume and mean curvature of M. We raise a conjecture for M to be a diffeomorphic sphere, and give some positive partial answer.
