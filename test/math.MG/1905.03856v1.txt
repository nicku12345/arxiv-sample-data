We study the size of the largest rectangle containing no point of a given point set in the two-dimensional torus, the dispersion of the point set. A known lower bound for the dispersion of any point set of cardinality n\ge 2 in this setting is 2/n. We show that if n is a Fibonacci number then the Fibonacci lattice has dispersion exactly 2/n meeting the lower bound. Moreover, we completely characterize integration lattices achieving the lower bound and provide insight into the structure of other optimal sets. We also treat related results in the nonperiodic setting.
