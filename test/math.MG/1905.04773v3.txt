We develop some design examples for approximating a target surface at the final rigidly folded state of a developable quadrilateral creased paper, which is folded with a 1-DOF rigid folding motion from the planar state. The final rigidly folded state is reached due to the clashing of panels. Now we can approximate some specific types of non-developable surfaces, but we do not yet fully understand how to approximate an arbitrary surface with a developable creased paper that has limited DOFs. Our designs might have applications in areas related to the formation of a shell structure from a planar region.
