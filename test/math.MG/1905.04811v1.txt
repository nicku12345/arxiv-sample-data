Let K_{\lambda} be the attractor of the following IFS \begin{equation*} \{f_1(x)=\lambda x, f_2(x)=\lambda x+1-\lambda\}, \;\;0<\lambda<1/2. \end{equation*} Given \alpha \geq 0, we say the line y=\alpha x is visible through K_{\lambda}\times K_{\lambda} if  \{(x, \alpha x): x\in \mathbb R\setminus \{0\}\}\cap ((K_{\lambda}\times K_{\lambda}))=\emptyset.  Let V=\left \{\alpha \geq 0: y=\alpha x \mbox{ is visible through } K_{\lambda}\times K_{\lambda} \right \}. In this paper, we give a completed description of V, e.g., its Hausdoff dimension and its topological property. Moreover, we also discuss another type of visible problem which is related to the slicing problem.
