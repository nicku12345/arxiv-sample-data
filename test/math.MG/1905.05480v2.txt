We define regular points of an extremal subset in an Alexandrov space and study their basic properties. We show that a neighborhood of a regular point in an extremal subset is almost isometric to an open subset in the Euclidean space and that the set of regular points in an extremal subset has full measure and is dense. These results actually hold for strained points in an extremal subset.
