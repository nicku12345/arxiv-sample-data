Let a sequence M_j of Alexandrov spaces collapse to a space X with only weak singularities. T. Yamaguchi constructed a map f_j:M_j\to X for large j called an almost Lipschitz submersion. We prove that if M_j has a uniform positive lower bound for the volumes of spaces of directions, which is sufficiently larger than the weakness of singularities of X, then f_j is a locally trivial fibration. Moreover, we show some properties on the intrinsic metric and the volume of the fibers of f_j.
