Let M^n be a closed convex hypersurface lying in a convex ball B(p,R) of the ambient (n+1)-manifold N^{n+1}. We prove that, by pinching Heintze-Reilly's inequality via sectional curvature upper bound of B(p,R), 1st eigenvalue and mean curvature of M, not only M is Hausdorff close and almost isometric to a geodesic sphere S(p_0,R_0) in N, but also its enclosed domain is C^{1,\alpha}-close to a geodesic ball of constant curvature.
