Let V be a Banach space where for fixed n, 1<n<\dim(V), all of its n-dimensional subspaces are isometric. In 1932, Banach asked if under this hypothesis V is necessarily a Hilbert space. Gromov, in 1967, answered it positively for even n and all V. In this paper we give a positive answer for real V and odd n of the form n=4k+1, with the possible exception of n=133. Our proof relies on a new characterization of ellipsoids in {\mathbb{R}}^n, n\geq 5, as the only symmetric convex bodies all of whose linear hyperplane sections are linearly equivalent affine bodies of revolution.
