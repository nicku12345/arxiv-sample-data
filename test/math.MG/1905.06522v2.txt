We prove a new version of isoperimetric inequality: Given a positive real m, a Banach space B, a closed subset Y of metric space X and a continuous map f:Y \rightarrow B with f(Y) compact \inf_FHC_{m+1}(F(X))\leq c(m)HC_m(f(Y))^{\frac{m+1}{m}}, where HC_m denotes the m-dimensional Hausdorff content, the infimum is taken over the set of all continuous maps F:X\longrightarrow B such that F(y)=f(y) for all y\in Y, and c(m) depends only on m. Moreover, one can find F with a nearly minimal HC_{m+1} such that its image lies in the C(m)HC_m(f(Y))^{1\over m}-neighbourhood of f(Y) with the exception of a subset with zero (m+1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure.   The paper also contains a very general coarea inequality for Hausdorff content and its modifications.   As an application we demonstrate an inequality conjectured by Larry Guth that relates the m-dimensional Hausdorff content of a compact metric space with its (m-1)-dimensional Urysohn width. We show that this result implies new systolic inequalities that both strengthen the classical Gromov's systolic inequality for essential Riemannian manifolds and extend this inequality to a wider class of non-simply connected manifolds.
