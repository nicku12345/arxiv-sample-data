Let f: [0,1]^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R} be a continuous function with zero mean and interpret f_{+} = \max(f, 0) and f_{-} = -\min(f, 0) as the densities of two measures. We prove that if the cost of transport from f_{+} to f_{-} is small (in terms of the Wasserstein distance W^1), then the nodal set \left\{x \in (0,1)^d: f(x) = 0 \right\} has to be large (`if it is always easy to buy milk, there must be many supermarkets'). More precisely, we show that  W_1(f_+, f_-) \cdot \mathcal{H}^{d-1}\left\{x \in (0,1)^d: f(x) = 0 \right\} \gtrsim_{d} \left( \frac{\|f\|_{L^1}}{\|f\|_{L^{\infty}}} \right)^{4 - \frac1d} \|f\|_{L^1} \, . We apply this ``uncertainty principle" to the metric Sturm-Liouville theory in higher dimensions to show that a linear combination of eigenfunctions of an elliptic operator cannot have an arbitrarily small zero set.
