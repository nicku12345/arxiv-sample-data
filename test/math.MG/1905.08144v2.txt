R. Nandakumar asked whether there is a tiling of the plane by pairwise incongruent triangles of equal area and equal perimeter. Recently a negative answer was given by Kupavskii, Pach and Tardos. Still one may ask for weaker versions of the problem, or for the analogue of this problem for quadrangles, pentagons, or hexagons. Several answers were given by the first author in a previous paper. Here we solve three further cases. In particular, our main result shows that there are vertex-to-vertex tilings by pairwise incongruent triangles of unit area and bounded perimeter.
