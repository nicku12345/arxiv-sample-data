A classical theorem of Hutchinson asserts that if an iterated function system acts on \mathbb{R}^d by similitudes and satisfies the open set condition then it admits a unique self-similar measure with Hausdorff dimension equal to the dimension of the attractor. In the class of measures on the attractor which arise as the projections of shift-invariant measures on the coding space, this self-similar measure is the unique measure of maximal dimension. In the context of affine iterated function systems it is known that there may be multiple shift-invariant measures of maximal dimension if the linear parts of the affinities share a common invariant subspace, or more generally if they preserve a finite union of proper subspaces of \mathbb{R}^d. In this note we construct examples where multiple invariant measures of maximal dimension exist even though the linear parts of the affinities do not preserve a finite union of proper subspaces.
