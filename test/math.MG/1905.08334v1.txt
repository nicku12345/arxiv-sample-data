This paper focuses on the relation among the existence of different types of curves (such as directional ones, quasi-geodesic or geodesic rays), the (approximate) fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings, and a discrete lion and man game. Our main result holds in the setting of CAT(0) spaces that are additionally Gromov hyperbolic.
