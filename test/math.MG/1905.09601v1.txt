Starting with the work of Preiss on the geometry of measures, the classification of uniform measures in \mathbb R^d has remained open, except for d=1 and for compactly supported measures in d=2, and for codimension 1. In this paper we study 1-dimensional measures in \mathbb R^d for all d and classify uniform measures with connected 1-dimensional support, which turn out to be homogeneous measures. We provide as well a partial classification of general uniform measures of dimension 1 in the absence of the connected support hypothesis.
