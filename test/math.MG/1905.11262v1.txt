In this small note we introduce a notion of self-stresses on the set functions in two variables with generic critical points. The notion naturally comes from a rather exotic representation of classical Maxwell frameworks in terms of differential forms. For the sake of clarity we work in the two-dimensional case only. However all the definitions for the higher dimensional case are straightforward.
