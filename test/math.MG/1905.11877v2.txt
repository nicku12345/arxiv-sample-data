We study the problem of chasing convex bodies online: given a sequence of convex bodies K_t\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d the algorithm must respond with points x_t\in K_t in an online fashion (i.e., x_t is chosen before K_{t+1} is revealed). The objective is to minimize the sum of distances between successive points in this sequence. Bubeck et al. (STOC 2019) gave a 2^{O(d)}-competitive algorithm for this problem. We give an algorithm that is O(\min(d, \sqrt{d \log T}))-competitive for any sequence of length T.
