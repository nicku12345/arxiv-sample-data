In this paper we obtain cyclic pentagons and hexagons with rational sides, diagonals and area all of which are expressed in terms of rational functions of several arbitrary rational parameters. On suitable scaling, we obtain cyclic pentagons and hexagons whose sides, diagonals and area are all given by integers.
