We study the usual notion of Scott rank but in the setting of Polish metric spaces. The signature consists of distance relations: for each rational q > 0, there is a relation R_{<q}(x,y) stating that the distance of x and y  is less than q. We show that compact spaces have Scott rank at most \omega, and that there are discrete ultrametric spaces of arbitrarily high countable Scott rank.
