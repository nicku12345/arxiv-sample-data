In this note we extend to the quasi-reflexive setting the result of F. Baudier, N. Kalton and G. Lancien concerning the non-embeddability of the family of countably branching trees into reflexive Banach spaces whose Szlenk index and Szlenk index from the dual are both equal to the first infinite ordinal \omega. We also gather results linking these notions with the spreading models of the space.
