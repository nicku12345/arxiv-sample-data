The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we cut off a part of a convex surface by a plane near a ridge point and characterize the limiting behavior of the surface measure in S^2 induced by this part of surface when the plane approaches the point. Second, this characterization is applied to Newton's least resistance problem for convex bodies: minimize the functional \int\int_\Omega (1 + |\nabla u(x,y)|^2)^{-1} dx dy in the class of convex functions u: \Omega \to [0,M], where \Omega \subset R^2 is a convex body and M > 0. It has been known that if u_* solves the problem then |\nabla u_*(x,y)| \ge 1 at all regular points (x,y) such that u_*(x,y) > 0. We prove that if the lower level set L_0 = \{ (x,y): u_*(x,y) = 0 \} has nonempty interior, then for almost all points of its boundary (\bar x, \bar y) \in \partial L_0 one has \lim_{\stackrel{(x,y)\to(\bar x,\bar y)}{u_*(x,y)>0}}|\nabla u_*(x,y)| = 1.
