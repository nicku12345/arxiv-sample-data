We say that a set of points S\subset \mathbb{R}^d is an \varepsilon-nearly k-distance set if there exist 1\le t_1\le \ldots\le t_k, such that the distance between any two distinct points in S falls into [t_1,t_1+\varepsilon]\cup\ldots\cup[t_k,t_k+\varepsilon]. In this paper, we study the quantity M_k(d) = \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\max\{|S|\ :\ S\text{ is an }\varepsilon\text{-nearly } k \text{-distance set in } \mathbb{R}^d\} and its relation to the classical quantity m_k(d): the size of the largest k-distance set in \mathbb{R}^d. We obtain that M_k(d) = m_k(d) for k=2,3, as well as for any fixed k, provided that d is sufficiently large. The last result answers a question, proposed by Erd\H{o}s, Makai and Pach.   We also address a closely related Tur\'an-type problem, studied by Erd\H{o}s, Makai, Pach, and Spencer in the 80's: given n points in \mathbb{R}^d, how many pairs of them form a distance that belongs to [t_1,t_1+1]\cup\ldots\cup[t_k,t_k+1], where t_1,\ldots, t_k are fixed and any two points in the set are at distance at least 1 apart? We establish the connection between this quantity and a quantity closely related to M_k(d-1), as well as obtain an exact answer for the same ranges k,d as above.
