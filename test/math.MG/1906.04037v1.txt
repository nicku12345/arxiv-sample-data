In the present paper we study S^2 \times R and H^2 \times R geometries, which are homogeneous Thurston 3-geometries. We analyse the interior angle sums of geodesic triangles in both geometries and prove, that in S^2 \times R space it can be larger or equal than \pi and in H^2 \times R space the angle sums can be less or equal than \pi. In our work we will use the projective model of S^2 \times R and H^2 \times R geometries described by E. Moln\'ar in \cite{M97}.
