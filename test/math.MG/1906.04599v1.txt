This paper is devoted to a systematic study of certain geometric integral inequalities which arise in continuum combinatorial approaches to L^p-improving inequalities for Radon-like transforms over polynomial submanifolds of intermediate dimension. The desired inequalities relate to and extend a number of important results in geometric measure theory.
