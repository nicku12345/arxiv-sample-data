In this paper we prove in certain n-dimensional normed spaces X the existence of full-dimensional equilateral simplices of large size inscribed to the unit ball B. This extends the construction of Makeev [Mak] in dimension 4 and we also compute an example of a space in which the idea cannot be applied.
