If K\subset\mathbb{R}^n is a convex body and \Gamma_pK is the p-centroid body of K, the L_p Busemann-Petty centroid inequality states that \vol(\Gamma_pK) \geq \vol(K), with equality if and only if K is an ellipsoid centered at the origin. In this work, we prove inequalities for a type of functional r-mixed volume for 1 \leq r < n, and establish as a consequence, a functional version of the L_p Busemann-Petty centroid inequality. \keywords{Convex body, Moment body, Busemann-Petty centroid} }
