Geometric characteristics of metric spaces that appear in formulas of the Gromov--Hausdorff distances from these spaces to so-called simplexes, i.e., to the metric spaces, all whose non-zero distances are the same are studied. The corresponding calculations essentially use geometry of partitions of these spaces. In the finite case, it gives the lengths of minimal spanning trees. A similar theory for compact metric spaces was worked out previously. In the present paper we generalize those results to any bounded metric space, and also, we simplify some proofs.
