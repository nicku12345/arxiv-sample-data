In this paper we deal with a general type of integral formulas of the visual angle, among them those of Crofton, Hurwitz and Masotti, from the point of view of Integral Geometry. The purpose is twofold: to provide an interpretation of these formulas in terms of integrals of densities with respect to the canonical measure in the space of pairs of lines and to give new simpler proofs of them.
