In the present paper the following Generalized Borsuk Problem is studied: Can a given bounded metric space X be partitioned into a given number m (probably an infinite one) of subsets, each of which has a smaller diameter than X? We give a complete answer to this question in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from X to a simplex of cardinality m and having a diameter less than X. Here a simplex is a metric space, all whose non-zero distances are the same.
