We study approximations of smooth convex bodies by random ball-polytopes. We examine the following probability model: let K\subset{\bf R}^d be a convex body such that K slides freely in a ball of radius R>0 and has C^2 smooth boundary. Let x_1,\ldots, x_n be i.i.d. uniform random points in K. For r\geq R, let K^r_{(n)} denote the intersection of all radius r closed balls that contain x_1,\ldots, x_n. Then K^r_{(n)} is a (uniform) random ball-polytope (of radius r) in K. We study the asymptotic properties of the expectation of the number of facets of K_{(n)}^r as n\to\infty. While sufficiently round convex bodies behave in a similar way with respect to random approximation by ball-polytopes as to classical polytopes, an interesting phenomenon can be observed when a unit ball is approximated by unit radius random ball-polytopes: the expected number of facets approaches a finite limit as n\to\infty.
