We define enlargeable length-structures on closed topological manifolds and then use Gromov's Spherical Lipschitz Bound Theorem to show that the connected sum of an enlargeable Riemannian manifold M^n (n\leq 8) with an arbitrary closed smooth manifold carries no Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature. Closed Riemannian manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature such as T^n and closed smooth manifold endowed with a locally CAT(0)-metric which is strongly equivalent to a Riemannian metric are examples of enlargeable Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, the result is true in arbitrary dimensions based on the main result of a recent paper by Schoen and Yau. We can also deal with the Gromov's strictly max-scalar curvature on the closed orientable topological manifolds.
