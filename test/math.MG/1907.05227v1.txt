We provide a sufficient Dini-type condition for a subset of a complete, quasiconvex metric space to be covered by a H\"older curve. This implies in particular that if the upper box-counting dimension of a set in a quasiconvex metric space is less or equal to d \geq 1, then for any \alpha < \frac{1}{d} the set can be covered by an \alpha-H\"older curve. On the other hand, for each 1\leq d <2 we give an example of a compact set K, in the plane, just failing the above Dini-type condition, with lower box-counting dimension equal to zero and upper box-counting dimension equal to d that can not be covered by a countable collection of \frac{1}{d}-H\"older curves.
