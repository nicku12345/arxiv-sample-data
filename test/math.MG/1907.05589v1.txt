The problem of optimal antipodal codes can be framed as finding low rank Gram matrices G with G_{ii} = 1 and |G_{ij}| \leq \epsilon for 1 \leq i \neq j \leq n. In 2018, Bukh and Cox introduced a new bounding technique by removing the condition that G be a gram matrix. In this work, we investigate how tight this relaxation is, and find exact results for real valued matrices of rank 2.
