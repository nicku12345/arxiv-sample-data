A metric measure space (X,d,\mu) is said to be A_{\infty} on curves if there exist constants \tau < 1 and \theta > 0 with the following property. For every x \in X, 0 < r \leq \mathrm{diam}(X), and a Borel set S \subset B(x,r) with \mu(S) > \tau \mu(B(x,r)), there exists a continuum \gamma \subset X of length \leq r satisfying \mathcal{H}^{1}_{\infty}(\gamma \cap S) \geq \theta r.   I first observe that spaces of Q-bounded geometry, Q > 1, are A_{\infty} on curves. Then, I show that any complete, doubling, and quasiconvex space (X,d,\mu) which is A_{\infty} on curves has Alberti representations with L^{p}-densities for some p > 1, depending only on the doubling and A_{\infty}-constants. More precisely, any normalised restriction of \mu to a ball B \subset X can be written as \mu_{B} = f_{B} \, d\nu_{B}, where \nu_{B} is a convex combination of measures of linear growth supported on continua of length \le \mathrm{diam}(B), and \|f_{B}\|_{L^{p}(\nu_{B})} \leq C for some constant C \geq 1 independent of B.
