We consider extensions of quasiconformal maps and the uniformization theorem to the setting of metric spaces X homeomorphic to \mathbb R^2. Given a measure \mu on such a space, we introduce \mu-quasiconformal maps f:X \to \mathbb R^2, whose definition involves deforming lengths of curves by \mu. We show that if \mu is an infinitesimally metric measure, i.e., it satisfies an infinitesimal version of the metric doubling measure condition of David and Semmes, then such a \mu-quasiconformal map exists. We apply this result to give a characterization of the metric spaces admitting an infinitesimally quasisymmetric parametrization.
