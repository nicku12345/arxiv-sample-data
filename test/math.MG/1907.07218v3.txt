This paper studies the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of isotropic projections of subsets of \mathbb{R}^{2n}, as well as dimension of intersections of sets with isotropic planes. It is shown that if A and B are Borel subsets of \mathbb{R}^{2n} of dimension greater than m, then for a positive measure set of isotropic m-planes, the intersection of the images of A and B under orthogonal projections onto these planes have positive Hausdorff m-measure. In addition, if A is a measurable set of Hausdorff dimension greater than m, then there is a set B\subset\mathbb{R}^{2n} with \dim B\leq m such that for all x\in\mathbb{R}^{2n}\setminus B there is a positive measure set of isotropic m-planes for which the translate by x of the orthogonal complement of each such plane, intersects A on a set of dimension \dim A-m. These results are then applied to obtain analogous results on the n^{th} Heisenberg group.
