 \newcommand{\R}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}} \newcommand{\lat}{\mathcal{L}} \newcommand{\ensuremath}[1]{#1} We show that \[ \mu(\lat) \lambda_1(\lat^*) < \big( 0.1275 + o(1) \big) \cdot n \; , \] where \mu(\lat) is the covering radius of an n-dimensional lattice \lat \subset \R^n and \lambda_1(\lat^*) is the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the dual lattice \lat^*. This improves on Banaszczyk's celebrated transference theorem (Math. Annal., 1993) by about 20%.   Our proof follows Banaszczyk exactly, except in one step, where we replace a Fourier-analytic bound on the discrete Gaussian mass with a slightly stronger bound based on packing. The packing-based bound that we use was already proven by Aggarwal, Dadush, Regev, and Stephens-Davidowitz (STOC, 2015) in a very different context. Our contribution is therefore simply the observation that this implies a better transference theorem.
