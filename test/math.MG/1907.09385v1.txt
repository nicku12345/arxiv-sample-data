In this paper we shall give a short proof of the result originally obtained by Ashutosh Kumar that for each A\subset \mathbb{R} there exists B\subset A full in A such that no distance between two distinct points from B is rational. We will construct a Bernstein subset of \mathbb{R} which also avoids rational distances. We will show some cases in which the former result may be extended to subsets of \mathbb{R}^2, i. e. it remains true for measurable subsets of the plane and if non(\mathcal{N})=cof(\mathcal{N}) then for a given set of positive outer measure we may find its full subset which is a partial bijection and avoids rational distances.
