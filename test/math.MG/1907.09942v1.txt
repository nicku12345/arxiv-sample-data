In the present paper we calculate the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between an arbitrary simplex (a metric space all whose non-zero distances are the same) and a finite metric space whose non-zero distances take two distinct values (so-called 2-distance spaces). As a corollary, a complete solution to generalized Borsuk problem for the 2-distance spaces is obtained. In addition, we derive formulas for the clique covering number and for the chromatic number of an arbitrary graph G in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a simplex and an appropriate 2-distance space constructed by the graph G.
