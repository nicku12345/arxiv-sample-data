For any positive real number p, the p-frame potential of N unit vectors X:=\{\mathbf x_1,\ldots,\mathbf x_N\}\subset \mathbb R^d is defined as {\rm FP}_{p,N,d}(X)=\sum_{i\neq j}|\langle \mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_j\rangle |^p. In this paper, we focus on the special case N=d+1 and establish the unique minimizer of {\rm FP}_{p,d+1,d} for p\in (0,2). Our results completely solve the minimization problem of p-frame potential when N=d+1, which confirms a conjecture posed by Chen, Gonzales, Goodman, Kang and Okoudjou.
