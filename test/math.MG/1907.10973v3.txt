Motivated by study of the autoequivalence group of triangulated categories via isometric actions on metric spaces, we consider curvature properties (CAT(0), Gromov hyperbolic) of the space of Bridgeland stability conditions with the canonical metric defined by Bridgeland. We then prove that the metric is neither CAT(0) nor hyperbolic, and the quotient metric by the natural \mathbb{C}-action is not CAT(0) in case of the Kronecker quiver. Moreover, we also show the hyperbolicity of pseudo-Anosov functors defined by Dimitrov-Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich, which yields the lower-bound of entropy by the translation length. Finally, pseudo-Anosov functors in case of curves have completely been classified.
