Solving a longstanding problem on equiangular lines, we determine, for each given fixed angle and in all sufficiently large dimensions, the maximum number of lines pairwise separated by the given angle.   Fix 0 < \alpha < 1. Let N_\alpha(d) denote the maximum number of lines through the origin in \mathbb{R}^d with pairwise common angle \arccos \alpha. Let k denote the minimum number (if it exists) of vertices in a graph whose adjacency matrix has spectral radius exactly (1-\alpha)/(2\alpha). If k < \infty, then N_\alpha(d) = \lfloor k(d-1)/(k-1) \rfloor for all sufficiently large d, and otherwise N_\alpha(d) = d + o(d). In particular, N_{1/(2k-1)}(d) = \lfloor k(d-1)/(k-1) \rfloor for every integer k\ge 2 and all sufficiently large d.   A key ingredient is a new result in spectral graph theory: the adjacency matrix of a connected bounded degree graph has sublinear second eigenvalue multiplicity.
