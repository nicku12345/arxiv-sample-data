In the Euclidean imaginary quadratic fields, continued fractions have been used to give rational approximations to complex numbers since the late 19th century. A variety of algorithms have been proposed in the 130 years following their introduction, but none are applicable outside of the same five fields. Here we overcome the non-Euclidean obstacle. We show how continued fractions can be produced in any imaginary quadratic field, and we prove that they share many of the properties enjoyed by their classical forebear. The inspiration for the algorithm is a fractal arrangement of circles arising from subsets of \text{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}) acting on the Riemann sphere. The geometry of these arrangements reveals an analog of the Euclidean algorithm that points us toward a more general continued fraction.
