We study the trigonometry of non-Euclidean tetrahedra using tools from algebraic geometry. We establish a bijection between non-Euclidean tetrahedra and certain rational elliptic surfaces. We interpret the edge lengths and the dihedral angles of a tetrahedron as values of Looijenga period maps for the corresponding surface. The Regge symmetries of a tetrahedron are related to the Weyl group W(D_6) action on the Picard lattice of the corresponding surface. We prove that the surfaces corresponding to a tetrahedron and its dual are isomorphic. This leads to certain unexpected relations between the dihedral angles and the edge lengths of a tetrahedron. For instance, the cross-ratio of the exponents of the solid angles of the tetrahedron equals to the cross-ratio of the exponents of the perimeters of its faces. A possible explanation of these results comes from analyzing mixed Hodge structures, which are naturally associated to tetrahedra and rational elliptic surfaces.
