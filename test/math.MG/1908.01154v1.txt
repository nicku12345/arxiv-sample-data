In this note prove the following Berwald-type inequality, showing that for any integrable log-concave function f:\mathbb R^n\rightarrow[0,\infty) and any concave function h:L\rightarrow\mathbb [0,\infty), where L is the epigraph of -\log \frac{f}{\Vert f\Vert_\infty}, then   p\to   \left(\frac{1}{\Gamma(1+p)\int_L e^{-t}dtdx}\int_L h^p(x,t)e^{-t}dtdx\right)^\frac{1}{p}    is decreasing in p\in(-1,\infty), extending the range of p where the monotonicity is known to hold true.   As an application of this extension, we will provide a new proof of a functional form of Zhang's reverse Petty projection inequality, recently obtained in [ABG].
