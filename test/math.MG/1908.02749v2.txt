The {\it largest angle bisection} procedure is the operation which partitions a given triangle, T, into two smaller triangles by constructing the angle bisector of the largest angle of T. Applying the procedure to each of these two triangles produces a partition of T into four smaller triangles. Continuing in this manner, after n iterations, the initial triangle is divided into 2^n small triangles. We prove that as n approaches infinity, the diameters of all these 2^n triangles tend to 0, the smallest angle of all these triangles is bounded away from 0, and that, with the exception of T being an isosceles right triangle, the number of dissimilar triangles is unbounded.
