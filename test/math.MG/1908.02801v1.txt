Two decades ago, Zauner conjectured that for every dimension d, there exists an equiangular tight frame consisting of d^2 vectors in \mathbb{C}^d. Most progress to date explicitly constructs the promised frame in various dimensions, and it now appears that a constructive proof of Zauner's conjecture may require progress on the Stark conjectures. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach involving biangular Gabor frames that may eventually lead to an unconditional non-constructive proof of Zauner's conjecture.
