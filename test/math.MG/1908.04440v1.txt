We introduce the quasi-hyperbolicity constant of a metric space, a rough isometry invariant that measures how a metric space deviates from being Gromov hyperbolic. This number, for unbounded spaces, lies in the closed interval [1,2]. The quasi-hyperbolicity constant of an unbounded Gromov hyperbolic space is equal to one. For a CAT(0)-space, it is bounded from above by \sqrt{2}. The quasi-hyperbolicity constant of a Banach space that is at least two dimensional is bounded from below by \sqrt{2}, and for a non-trivial L_p-space it is exactly \max\{2^{1/p},2^{1-1/p}\}. If 0 < \alpha < 1 then the quasi-hyperbolicity constant of the \alpha-snowflake of any metric space is bounded from above by 2^\alpha. We give an exact calculation in the case of the \alpha-snowflake of the Euclidean real line.
