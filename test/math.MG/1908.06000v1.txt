We say two \delta-tubes (dimension \delta\times\cdots\times\delta\times1) in \mathbb{R}^n are essentially distinct if the measure of their intersection is smaller than a half of a single \delta-tube. For a collection of essentially distinct \delta-tubes, we give the asymptotically sharp lower bound for the measure of their union. Then we characterize all sharp examples. We will give a new measurement of convexity based on the X-ray transform.
