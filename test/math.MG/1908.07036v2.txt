We develop a structure theory for RCD spaces with curvature bounded above in Alexandrov sense. In particular, we show that any such space is a topological manifold with boundary whose interior is equal to the set of regular points. Further the set of regular points is a smooth manifold and is geodesically convex. Around regular points there are DC coordinates and the distance is induced by a continuous BV Riemannian metric.
