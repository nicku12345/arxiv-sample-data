We prove a C^m Lusin approximation theorem for horizontal curves in the Heisenberg group. This states that every absolutely continuous horizontal curve whose horizontal velocity is m-1 times L^1 differentiable almost everywhere coincides with a C^m horizontal curve except on a set of small measure. Conversely, we show that the result no longer holds if L^1 differentiability is replaced by approximate differentiability. This shows our result is optimal and highlights differences between the Heisenberg and Euclidean settings.
