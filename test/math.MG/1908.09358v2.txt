Let Q_n be the cube of side length one centered at the origin in \mathbb{R}^n, and let F be an affine (n-d)-dimensional subspace of \mathbb{R}^n having distance to the origin less than or equal to \frac 1 2, where 0<d<n. We show that the (n-d)-dimensional volume of the section Q_n \cap F is bounded below by a value c(d) depending only on the codimension d but not on the ambient dimension n or a particular subspace F. In the case of hyperplanes, d=1, we show that c(1) = \frac{1}{17} is a possible choice. We also consider a complex analogue of this problem for a hyperplane section of the polydisc.
