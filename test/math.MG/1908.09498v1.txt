A natural model for the approximation of a convex body K in \mathbb{R}^d by random polytopes is obtained as follows. Take a stationary Poisson hyperplane process in the space, and consider the random polytope Z_K defined as the intersection of all closed halfspaces containing K that are bounded by hyperplanes of the process not intersecting K. If f is a functional on convex bodies, then for increasing intensities of the process, the expectation of the difference f(Z_K)-f(K) may or may not converge to zero. If it does, then the order of convergence and possible limit relations are of interest. We study these questions if f is either the hitting functional or the mean width.
