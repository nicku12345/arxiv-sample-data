We define and investigate \alpha-modulation spaces M_{p,q}^{s,\alpha}(G) associated to a step two stratified Lie group G with rational structure constants. This is an extension of the Euclidean \alpha-modulation spaces M_{p,q}^{s,\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n) that act as intermediate spaces between the modulation spaces (\alpha = 0) in time-frequency analysis and the Besov spaces (\alpha = 1) in harmonic analysis. We will illustrate that the the group structure and dilation structure on G affect the boundary cases \alpha = 0,1 where the spaces M_{p,q}^{s}(G) and \mathcal{B}_{p,q}^{s}(G) have non-standard translation and dilation symmetries. Moreover, we show that the spaces M_{p,q}^{s,\alpha}(G) are non-trivial and generally distinct from their Euclidean counterparts. Finally, we examine how the metric geometry of the coverings \mathcal{Q}(G) underlying the \alpha = 0 case M_{p,q}^{s}(G) allows for the existence of geometric embeddings \[F:M_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^k) \longrightarrow{} M_{p,q}^{s}(G),\] as long as k (that only depends on G) is small enough. Our approach naturally gives rise to several open problems that is further elaborated at the end of the paper.
