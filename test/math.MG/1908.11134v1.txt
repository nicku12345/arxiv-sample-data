We investigate several topics of triangle geometry in the elliptic and in the extended hyperbolic plane, such as: centers based on orthogonality, centers related to circumcircles and incircles, radical centers and centers of similitude, orthology, Kiepert perspectors and related objects, Tucker circles, isoptics, substitutes for the Euler line. For both, the elliptic and the extended hyperbolic plane, a uniform metric is used.
