Motivated by computational geometry of point configurations on the Euclidean plane, and by the theory of cluster algebras of type A, we introduce and study Heronian friezes, the Euclidean analogues of Coxeter's frieze patterns. We prove that a generic Heronian frieze possesses the glide symmetry (hence is periodic), and establish the appropriate version of the Laurent phenomenon.   For a closely related family of Cayley-Menger friezes, we identify an algebraic condition of coherence, which all friezes of geometric origin satisfy. This yields an unambiguous propagation rule for coherent Cayley-Menger friezes, as well as the corresponding periodicity results.
