We give a short proof of a theorem of Guth relating volume of balls and Uryson width. The same approach applies to Hausdorff content implying a recent result of Liokumovich-Lishak-Nabutovsky-Rotman. We show also that for any C>0 there is a Riemannian metric g on a 3-sphere such that \text{vol}(S^3,g)=1 and for any map f:S^3\to \mathbb{R}^2 there is some x\in \mathbb{R}^2 for which \text{diam}(f^{-1}(x))>C-answering a question of Guth.
