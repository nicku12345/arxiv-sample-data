Asymptotic normality for the natural volume measure of random polytopes generated by random points distributed uniformly in a convex body in spherical or hyperbolic spaces is proved. Also the case of Hilbert geometries is treated and central limit theorems in Lutwak's dual Brunn--Minkowski theory are established. The results follow from a central limit theorem for weighted random polytopes in Euclidean spaces. In the background are Stein's method for normal approximation and geometric properties of weighted floating bodies.
