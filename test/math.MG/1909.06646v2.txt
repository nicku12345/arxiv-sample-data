This paper is the first in a two-part series. In this paper, we prove that the Assouad-Nagata dimension of any finitely generated (but not necessarily finitely presented) C'(1/6) group is at most 2. In the next paper, we use this result, along with techniques of classical small cancellation theory, to answer two open questions in the study of asymptotic and Assouad-Nagata dimension of finitely generated groups.
