Let x and y be two unit vectors in a normed plane \mathbb{R}^2. We say that x is Birkhoff orthogonal to y if the line through x in the direction y supports the unit disc. A B-measure (Fankh\"anel 2011) is an angular measure \mu on the unit circle for which \mu(C)=\pi/2 whenever C is a shorter arc of the unit circle connecting two Birkhoff orthogonal points. We present a characterization of the normed planes that admit a B-measure.
