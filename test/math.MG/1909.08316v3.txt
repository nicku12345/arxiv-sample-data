Rudelson's theorem states that if for a set of unit vectors u_i and positive weights c_i, we have that \sum c_i u_i\otimes u_i is the identity operator I on {\mathbb R}^d, then the sum of a random sample of Cd\ln d of these diadic products is close to I. The \ln d term cannot be removed.   On the other hand, the recent fundamental result of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava and its improvement by Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava show that the \ln d term can be removed, if one wants to show the existence of a good approximation of I as the average of a few diadic products. It is known that essentially the same proof as Rudelson's yields a more general statement about the average of positive semi-definite matrices.   First, we give an example of an average of positive semi-definite matrices where there is no approximation of this average by Cd elements. Thus, the result of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava cannot be extended to this wider class of matrices.   Next, we present a stability version of Rudelson's result on positive semi-definite matrices, and thus, extend it to certain non-symmetric matrices. This yields applications to the study of the Banach--Mazur distance of convex bodies.   Finally, we show that in some cases, one needs to take a subset of the vectors of order d^2 to approximate the identity.
