In this work we study the geodesic structure of the space \Sigma (X) of compact balls of a complete and locally compact metric length space endowed with the Hausdorff distance d_H. In particular, we focus on a geometric condition (referred to as the shooting property) that enables us to give an explicit isometry between (\Sigma (X),d_H) and the closed half-space  X\times \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} endowed with a taxicab metric.
