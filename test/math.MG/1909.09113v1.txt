We establish a uniformization result for metric surfaces - metric spaces that are topological surfaces with locally finite Hausdorff 2-measure.   Using the geometric definition of quasiconformality, we show that a metric surface that can be covered by quasiconformal images of Euclidean domains is quasiconformally equivalent to a Riemannian surface. To prove this, we construct suitable isothermal coordinates.
