We introduce a probability distribution on \mathcal{P}([0,1]^d), the space of all Borel probability measures on [0,1]^d. Under this distribution, almost all measures are shown to have infinite upper quasi-Assouad dimension and zero lower quasi-Assouad dimension (hence the upper and lower Assouad dimensions are almost surely infinite or zero). We also indicate how the results extend to other Assouad-like dimensions.
