We study the nonlinear embeddability of Banach spaces and the equi-embeddability of the family of Kalton's interlaced graphs ([\mathbb N]^k,d_{\mathbb K})_k into dual spaces. Notably, we define and study a modification of Kalton's property \mathcal Q that we call property \mathcal{Q}_p (with p \in (1,+\infty]). We show that if ([\mathbb N]^k,d_{\mathbb K})_k equi-coarse Lipschitzly embeds into X^*, then the Szlenk index of X is greater than \omega, and that this is optimal, i.e., there exists a separable dual space Y^* that contains ([\mathbb N]^k,d_{\mathbb K})_k equi-Lipschitzly and so that Y has Szlenk index \omega^2. We prove that c_0 does not coarse Lipschitzly embed into a separable dual space by a map with distortion strictly smaller than \frac{3}{2}. We also show that neither c_0 nor L_1 coarsely embeds into a separable dual by a weak-to-weak^* sequentially continuous map.
