We construct for every finite-dimensional Alexandrov space A and every point p \in A a 2-convex function f_p in a small neighborhood around p, which approximates \operatorname{dist}_p^2 up to second order. Moreover, the function f_p can be lifted to Gromov-Hausdorff close Alexandrov spaces of the same dimension.
