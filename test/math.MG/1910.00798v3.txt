The Danzer--Gr\"unbaum acute angles problem asks for the largest size of a set of points in {\mathbb R}^d that determines only acute angles. Recently, the problem was essentially solved thanks to the results of the second author and of Gerencs\'er and Harangi: now, the lower and the upper bounds are 2^{d-1}+1 and 2^d-1, respectively. The lower-bound construction is surprisingly simple. In this note, we suggest the following variant of the problem, which is one way to "save" the problem. Put F(\alpha) = \lim_{d\to \infty} f(d,\alpha)^{1/d}, where f(d,\alpha) is the largest set of points in {\mathbb R}^d with no angle greater than \alpha. Then the question is to find c:= \lim_{\alpha\to \pi/2^-}F(\alpha). Although one may expect that c=2 in view of the result of Gerencs\'er and Harangi, the best lower bound we could get is c\ge \sqrt 2. We also solve a related problem of Erdos and F\"uredi on the "stability" of the acute angles problem and refute another conjecture stated in the same paper.
