In this paper, we define a new metric structure on the shape space of a high genus surface. We introduce a rigorous definition of a shape of a surface and construct a metric based on two energies measuring the area distortion and the angle distortion of a quasiconformal homeomorphism. We show that the energy minimizer in a fixed homotopy class is achieved by a quasiconformal homeomorphism by the lower semicontinuity property of these two energies.
