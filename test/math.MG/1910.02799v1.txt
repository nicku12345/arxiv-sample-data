We study ancient solutions of polynomial growth to both continuous-time and discrete-time heat equations on graphs with unbounded Laplacians. We generalize Colding and Minicozzi's theorem [CM19] on manifolds, and the result [Hua19] on graphs with normalized Laplacians to the setting of graphs with unbounded Laplacians: For a graph admitting an intrinsic metric, which has polynomial volume growth, the dimension of the space of ancient solutions of polynomial growth is bounded by the dimension of harmonic functions with the same growth up to some factor.
