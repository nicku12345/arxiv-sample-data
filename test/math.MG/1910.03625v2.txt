The present paper deals with some structural properties of transportation cost spaces, also known as Arens-Eells spaces, Lipschitz-free spaces and Wasserstein spaces. The main results of this work are: (1) A necessary and sufficient condition on an infinite metric space M, under which the transportation cost space on M contains an isometric copy of \ell_1. The obtained condition is applied to answer the open questions asked by C\'uth and Johanis (2017) concerning several specific metric spaces. (2) The description of the transportation cost space of a weighted finite graph G as the quotient \ell_1(E(G))/Z(G), where E(G) is the edge set and Z(G) is the cycle space of G. This is a generalization of the previously known result to the case of any finite metric space.
