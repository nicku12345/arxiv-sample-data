In this note we prove that any monohedral tiling of the closed circular unit disc with k \leq 3 topological discs as tiles has a k-fold rotational symmetry. This result yields the first nontrivial estimate about the minimum number of tiles in a monohedral tiling of the circular disc in which not all tiles contain the center, and the first step towards answering a question of Stein appearing in the problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy in 1994.
