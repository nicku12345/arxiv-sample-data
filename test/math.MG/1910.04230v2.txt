In this article, given two finite simplicial graphs \Gamma_1 and \Gamma_2, we state and prove a complete description of the possible morphisms C(\Gamma_1) \to C(\Gamma_2) between the right-angled Coxeter groups C(\Gamma_1) and C(\Gamma_2). As an application, assuming that \Gamma_2 is triangle-free, we show that, if C(\Gamma_1) is isomorphic to a subgroup of C(\Gamma_2), then the ball of radius 8|\Gamma_1||\Gamma_2| in C(\Gamma_2) contains the basis of a subgroup isomorphic to C(\Gamma_1). This provides an algorithm determining whether or not, among two given two-dimensional right-angled Coxeter groups, one is isomorphic to a subgroup of the other.
