For 3-dimensional convex polytopes, inscribability is a classical property that is relatively well-understood due to its relation with Delaunay subdivisions of the plane and hyperbolic geometry. In particular, inscribability can be tested in polynomial time, and for every f-vector of 3-polytopes, there exists an inscribable polytope with that f-vector. For higher-dimensional polytopes, much less is known. Of course, for any inscribable polytope, all of its lower-dimensional faces need to be inscribable, but this condition does not appear to be very strong.   We observe non-trivial new obstructions to the inscribability of polytopes that arise when imposing that a certain inscribable face be inscribed. Using this obstruction, we show that the duals of the 4-dimensional cyclic polytopes with at least 8 vertices---all of whose faces are inscribable---are not inscribable. This result is optimal in the following sense: We prove that the duals of the cyclic 4-polytopes with up to 7 vertices are, in fact, inscribable.   Moreover, we interpret this obstruction combinatorially as a forbidden subposet of the face lattice of a polytope, show that d-dimensional cyclic polytopes with at least d+4 vertices are not circumscribable, and that no dual of a neighborly 4-polytope with 8 vertices, that is, no polytope with f-vector (20,40,28,8), is inscribable.
