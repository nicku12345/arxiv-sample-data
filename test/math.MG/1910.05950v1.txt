Line systems passing through the origin of the d dimensional Euclidean space admitting exactly two distinct angles are called biangular. It is shown that the maximum cardinality of biangular lines is at least 2(d-1)(d-2), and this result is sharp for d\in\{4,5,6\}. Connections to binary codes, few-distance sets, and association schemes are explored, along with their multiangular generalization.
