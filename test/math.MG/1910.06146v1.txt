For a compact set A \subset {\mathbb R}^d and an integer k\ge1, let us denote by  A[k] = \left\{a_1+\cdots +a_k: a_1, \ldots, a_k\in A\right\}=\sum_{i=1}^k A the Minkowski sum of k copies of A. A theorem of Shapley, Folkmann and Starr (1969) states that \frac{1}{k}A[k] converges to the convex hull of A in Hausdorff distance as k tends to infinity. Bobkov, Madiman and Wang (2011) conjectured that the volume of \frac{1}{k}A[k] is non-decreasing in k , or in other words, in terms of the volume deficit between the convex hull of A and \frac{1}{k}A[k], this convergence is monotone. It was proved by Fradelizi, Madiman, Marsiglietti and Zvavitch (2016) that this conjecture holds true if d=1 but fails for any d \geq 12. In this paper we show that the conjecture is true for any star-shaped set A \subset {\mathbb R}^d for arbitrary dimensions d \ge 1 under the condition k \ge d-1. In addition, we investigate the conjecture for connected sets and present a counterexample to a generalization of the conjecture to the Minkowski sum of possibly distinct sets in {\mathbb R}^d, for any d \geq 7.
