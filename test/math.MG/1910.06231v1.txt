We prove an extension of a ham sandwich theorem for families of lines in the plane by Dujmovi\'{c} and Langerman. Given two sets A, B of n lines each in the plane, we prove that it is possible to partition the plane into r convex regions such that the following holds. For each region C of the partition there is a subset of c_r n^{1/r} lines of A whose pairwise intersections are in C, and the same holds for B. In this statement c_r only depends on r. We also prove that the dependence on n is optimal.
