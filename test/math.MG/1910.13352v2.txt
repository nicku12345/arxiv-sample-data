A famous result about mass partitions is the so called \emph{Ham-Sandwich theorem}. It states that any d mass distributions in \mathbb{R}^d can be simultaneously bisected by a single hyperplane. In this work, we study two related questions.   The first one is how many masses we can simultaneously partition with a k-fan, that is, k half-hyperplanes in \mathbb{R}^d, emanating from a common (d-2)-dimensional apex. This question was extensively studied in the plane, but in higher dimensions the only known results are for the case where k is an odd prime. We extend these results to a larger family of values of k. We further present a new result for k=2, which generalizes to cones.   The second question considers bisections with double wedges or, equivalently, Ham-Sandwich cuts after projective transformations. Here we prove that given d families of d+1 point sets each, there is always a projective transformation such that after the transformation, each family has a Ham-Sandwich cut. We further prove a result on partitions with parallel hyperplanes after a projective transformation.
