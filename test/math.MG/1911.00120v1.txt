Let X and Y be length metric spaces. Let \mathcal H^n denote the n-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The Lipschitz-Volume Rigidity is a property that if there exists a 1-Lipschitz map f\colon X\to Y and 0<\mathcal H^n(X)=\mathcal H^n(f(X))<\infty, then f preserves the length of path. This property holds for smooth manifolds but doesn't hold for all singular spaces. We survey the Lipschitz-Volume Rigidity Theorems on singular spaces with lower curvature bounds and discuss some related open problems.
