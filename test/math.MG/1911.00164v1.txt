In this paper, we consider the problem of projecting networks onto metric spaces. Networks are structures that encode relationships between pairs of elements or nodes. However, these relationships can be independent of each other, and need not be defined for every pair of nodes. This is in contrast to a metric space, which requires that a distance between every pair of elements in the space be defined. To understand how to project networks onto metric spaces, we take an axiomatic approach: we first state two axioms for projective maps from the set of all networks to the set of finite metric spaces, then show that only one projection satisfies these requirements. The developed technique is shown to be an effective method for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Finally, we illustrate the use of metric trees for efficient search in projected networks.
