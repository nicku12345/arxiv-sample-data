We study networks in \R^n which are periodic under a lattice of rank~n and have vertices of prescribed degree d\ge 3. We minimize the length of the quotient networks, subject to the constraint that the fundamental domain has n-dimensional volume~1. For n=3 and degree 3\leq d\leq 6 we determine the minimizing networks with the least number of vertices in the quotient, while for d\ge 7 we state a length estimate. For general n, we determine the unique minimizers with d=n+1 and d=2n.
