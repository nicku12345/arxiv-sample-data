Poisson processes in the space of (d-1)-dimensional totally geodesic subspaces (hyperplanes) in a d-dimensional hyperbolic space of constant curvature -1 are studied. The k-dimensional Hausdorff measure of their k-skeleton is considered. Explicit formulas for first- and second-order quantities restricted to bounded observation windows are obtained. The central limit problem for the k-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the k-skeleton is approached in two different set-ups: (i) for a fixed window and growing intensities, and (ii) for fixed intensity and growing spherical windows. While in case (i) the central limit theorem is valid for all d\geq 2, it is shown that in case (ii) the central limit theorem holds for d\in\{2,3\} and fails if d\geq 4 and k=d-1 or if d\geq 7 and for general k. Also rates of convergence are studied and multivariate central limit theorems are obtained. Moreover, the situation in which the intensity and the spherical window are growing simultaneously is discussed. In the background are the Malliavin-Stein method for normal approximation and the combinatorial moment structure of Poisson U-statistics as well as tools from hyperbolic integral geometry.
