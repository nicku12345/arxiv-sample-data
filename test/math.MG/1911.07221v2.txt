The typical cell of a Voronoi tessellation generated by n+1 uniformly distributed random points on the d-dimensional unit sphere \mathbb S^d is studied. Its f-vector is identified in distribution with the f-vector of a beta' polytope generated by n random points in \mathbb R^d. Explicit formulae for the expected f-vector are provided for any d and the low-dimensional cases d\in\{2,3,4\} are studied separately. This implies an explicit formula for the total number of k-dimensional faces in the spherical Voronoi tessellation as well.
