We prove that for every smooth Jordan curve \gamma, if X is the set of all r \in [0,1] so that there is an inscribed rectangle in \gamma of aspect ratio \tan(r\cdot \pi/4), then the Lebesgue measure of X is at least 1/3. To do this, we study disjoint M\"obius strips bounding a (2n,n)-torus link in the solid torus times an interval. We prove that any such set of M\"obius strips can be equipped with a natural total ordering. We then combine this total ordering with some additive combinatorics to prove that 1/3 is a sharp lower bound on the probability that a M\"obius strip bounding the (2,1)-torus knot in the solid torus times an interval will intersect its rotation by a uniformly random angle.
