We address an analog of a problem introduced by Erd\H{o}s and Fishburn, itself an inverse formulation of the famous Erd\H{o}s distance problem, in which the usual Euclidean distance is replaced with the metric induced by the \ell^1-norm, commonly referred to as the \textit{taxicab metric}. Specifically, we investigate the following question: given d,k\in \mathbb{N}, what is the maximum size of a subset of \mathbb{R}^d that determines at most k distinct taxicab distances, and can all such optimal arrangements be classified? We completely resolve the question in dimension d=2, as well as the k=1 case in dimension d=3, and we also provide a full resolution in the general case under an additional hypothesis.
