The goal of this paper is to study geometric and extremal properties of the convex body B_{\mathcal F(M)}, which is the unit ball of the Lipschitz-free Banach space associated with a finite metric space M. We investigate \ell_1 and \ell_\infty-sums, in particular we characterize the metric spaces such that B_{\mathcal F(M)} is a Hanner polytope. We also characterize the finite metric spaces whose Lipschitz-free spaces are isometric. We discuss the extreme properties of the volume product   \mathcal{P}(M)=|B_{\mathcal F(M)}|\cdot|B_{\mathcal F(M)}^\circ|, when the number of elements of M is fixed. We show that if \mathcal P(M) is maximal among all the metric spaces with the same number of points, then all triangle inequalities in M are strict and B_{\mathcal F(M)} is simplicial. We also focus on the metric spaces minimizing \mathcal P(M), and in the Mahler's conjecture for this class of convex bodies.
