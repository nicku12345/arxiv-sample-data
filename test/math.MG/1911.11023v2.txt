We consider the problem of estimating the distance between two bodies of volume \varepsilon located inside a n-dimensional ball U of unit volume for n\to\infty. Let A be a closed set with a smooth boundary of the volume \varepsilon (0 \leq \varepsilon \leq 1/2) inside a n-dimensional ball U of unit volume that implements among all the sets of volume \varepsilon is a set with the smallest possible free surface area, lying in one half-space with respect to a certain hyperplane that passes through the center of the ball. Then A has the same free surface area as the set representing the intersection of a ball perpendicular to U and the ball U itself.
