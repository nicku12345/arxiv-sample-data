We introduce a class of mappings called vertical quasi-isometries and show that branched quasisymmetries X\to Y of Guo and Williams between compact, bounded turning metric doubling spaces admit natural vertically quasi-isometric extensions \widehat X\to \widehat Y between hyperbolic fillings \widehat X and \widehat Y of X and Y, respectively. We also give a converse for this result by showing that a finite multiplicity vertical quasi-isometry \widehat X \to \widehat Y between hyperbolic fillings induces a branched quasisymmetry X \to Y.
