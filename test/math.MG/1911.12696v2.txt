The beta polytope P_{n,d}^\beta is the convex hull of n i.i.d. random points distributed in the unit ball of \mathbb{R}^d according to a density proportional to (1-\lVert{x}\rVert^2)^{\beta} if \beta>-1 (in particular, \beta=0 corresponds to the uniform distribution in the ball), or uniformly on the unit sphere if \beta=-1. We show that the expected normalized volumes of high-dimensional beta polytopes exhibit a phase transition and we describe its shape. We derive analogous results for the intrinsic volumes of beta polytopes and, when \beta=0, their number of vertices.
