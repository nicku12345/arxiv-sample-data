Geometric and functional Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities for the lattice point enumerator \mathrm{G}_n(\cdot) are provided. In particular, we show that \mathrm{G}_n((1-\lambda)K + \lambda L + (-1,1)^n)^{1/n}\geq (1-\lambda)\mathrm{G}_n(K)^{1/n}+\lambda\mathrm{G}_n(L)^{1/n} for any non-empty bounded sets K, L\subset\mathbb{R}^n and all \lambda\in(0,1).   We also show that these new discrete versions imply the classical results, and discuss some links with other related inequalities.
