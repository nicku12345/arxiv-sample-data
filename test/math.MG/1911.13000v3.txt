Inspired by Gromov's work on 'Metric inequalities with scalar curvature' we establish band width inequalities for Riemannian bands of the form (V=M\times[0,1],g), where M^{n-1} is a closed manifold. We introduce a new class of orientable manifolds we call filling enlargeable and prove: If M is filling enlargeable and all unit balls in the universal cover of (V,g) have volume less than a constant \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_n, then width(V,g)\leq1. We show that if a closed orientable manifold is enlargeable or aspherical, then it is filling enlargeable. Furthermore we establish that whether a closed orientable manifold is filling enlargeable or not only depends on the image of the fundamental class under the classifying map of the universal cover.
