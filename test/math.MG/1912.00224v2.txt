The following generalisation of the Erd\H{o}s unit distance problem was recently suggested by Palsson, Senger and Sheffer. Given k positive real numbers \delta_1,\dots,\delta_k, a (k+1)-tuple (p_1,\dots,p_{k+1}) in \mathbb{R}^d is called a (\delta,k)-chain if \|p_j-p_{j+1}\| = \delta_j for every 1\leq j \leq k. What is the maximum number C_k^d(n) of (k,\delta)-chains in a set of n points in \mathbb{R}^d, where the maximum is taken over all \delta? Improving the results of Palsson, Senger and Sheffer, we essentially determine this maximum for all k in the planar case. error term It is only for k\equiv 1 (mod) 3 that the answer depends on the maximum number of unit distances in a set of n points. We also obtain almost sharp results for even k in 3 dimension.
