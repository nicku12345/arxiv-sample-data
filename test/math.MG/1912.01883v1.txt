Given sets \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 of sizes m and n respectively, we are interested in the number of distinct distances spanned by \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{Q}. Let D(m, n) denote the minimum number of distances determined by sets in \mathbb{R}^2 of sizes m and n respectively, where m \leq n. Elekes \cite{CircleGrids} showed that D(m, n) = O(\sqrt{mn}) when m \leq n^{1/3}. For m \geq n^{1/3}, we have the upper bound D(m, n) = O(n/\sqrt{\log n}) as in the classical distinct distances problem.   In this work, we show that Elekes' construction is tight by deriving the lower bound of D(m, n) = \Omega(\sqrt{mn}) when m \leq n^{1/3}. This is done by adapting Sz\'{e}kely's crossing number argument. We also extend the Guth and Katz analysis for the classical distinct distances problem to show a lower bound of D(m, n) = \Omega(\sqrt{mn}/\log n) when m \geq n^{1/3}.
