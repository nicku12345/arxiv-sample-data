A sphere packing of the three-dimensional Euclidean space is compact if it has only tetrahedral holes, that is, any local maximum of the distance to the spheres is at equal distance to exactly four spheres. This papers describes all the compact packings with spheres of three different sizes. They are close-compact packings of unit spheres with holes filled in four different ways by smaller spheres.
