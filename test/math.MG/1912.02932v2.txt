Let A be abelian variety over the function field K of a compact Riemann surface B. Fix a model f \colon \mathcal{A} \to B of A/K and a certain effective horizontal divisor \mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{A}. We study various properties concerning the finiteness, growth order, and generic emptyness of the set of (S, \mathcal{D})-integral sections in \mathcal{A}. Here, S \subset B is an arbitrary subset and thus not necessarily finite nor countable. These integral sections \sigma correspond to rational points in A(K) which satisfy the extra geometric condition f ( \sigma(B) \cap \mathcal{D})\subset S. This notion of integral points generalizes the integral solutions of a system of {Diophantine equations}. Developing the idea of Parshin, we introduce in this context the so-called hyperbolic-homotopic height as a substitute for the classical intersection theory. We then establish several new results concerning the finiteness of various large unions of (S, \mathcal{D})-integral points and their polynomial growth in terms of \# S\cap U, where the sets S \subset B is required to be finite only in a small open subset U of B. Such results are out of reach of a purely algebraic method. Thereby, we give some new evidence and phenomena to the Geometric Lang-Vojta conjecture. As an application, we obtain certain strong generic emptiness properties of integral points on abelian varieties over function fields.
