Let X\in\text{Alex}\,^n(-1) be an n-dimensional Alexandrov space with curvature \ge -1. Let the r-scale (k,\epsilon)-singular set \mathcal S^k_{\epsilon,\,r}(X) be the collection of x\in X so that B_r(x) is not \epsilon r-close to a ball in any splitting space \mathbb R^{k+1}\times Z. We show that there exists C(n,\epsilon)>0 and \beta(n,\epsilon)>0, independent of the volume, so that for any disjoint collection \big\{B_{r_i}(x_i):x_i\in \mathcal S_{\epsilon,\,\beta r_i}^k(X)\cap B_1, \,r_i\le 1\big\}, the packing estimate \sum r_i^k\le C holds. Consequently, we obtain the Hausdorff measure estimates \mathcal H^k(\mathcal S^k_\epsilon(X)\cap B_1)\le C and \mathcal H^n\big(B_r (\mathcal S^k_{\epsilon,\,r}(X))\cap B_1(p)\big)\leq C\,r^{n-k}. This answers an open question asked by Kapovitch and Lytchak. We also show that the k-singular set \mathcal S^k(X)=\underset{\epsilon>0}\cup\left(\underset{r>0}\cap\mathcal S^k_{\epsilon,\,r}\right) is k-rectifiable and construct examples to show that such a structure is sharp. For instance, in the k=1 case we can build for any closed set T\subseteq \mathbb S^1 and \epsilon>0 a space Y\in\text{Alex}^3(0) with \mathcal S^{1}_\epsilon(Y)=\phi(T), where \phi\colon\mathbb S^1\to Y is a bi-Lipschitz embedding. Taking T to be a Cantor set it gives rise to an example where the singular set is a 1-rectifiable, 1-Cantor set with positive 1-Hausdorff measure.
