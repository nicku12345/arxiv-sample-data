We show how the variational characterisation of spherical designs can be used to take a union of spherical designs to obtain a spherical design of higher order (degree, precision, exactness) with a small number of points. The examples that we consider involve taking the orbits of two vectors under the action of a complex reflection group to obtain a weighted spherical (t,t)-design. These designs have a high degree of symmetry (compared to the number of points), and many are the first known construction of such a design, e.g., a 32 point (9,9)-design for \mathbb{C}^2, a 48 point (4,4)-design for \mathbb{C}^3, and a 400 point (5,5)-design for \mathbb{C}^4.From a real reflection group, we construct a 360 point (9,9)-design for \mathbb{R}^4 (spherical half-design of order 18), i.e., a 720 point spherical 19-design for \mathbb{R}^4.
