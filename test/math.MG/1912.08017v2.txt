Macdonald studied a discrete volume measure for a rational polytope P, called solid angle sum, that gives a natural discrete volume for P. We give a local formula for the codimension two quasi-coefficient of the solid angle sum of P. We also show how to recover the classical Ehrhart quasi-polynomial from the solid angle sum and in particular we find a similar local formula for the codimension one and codimension two quasi-coefficients. These local formulas are naturally valid for all positive real dilates of P.   An interesting open question is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions on a polytope P for which the discrete volume of P given by the solid angle sum equals its continuous volume: A_P(t) = \mathrm{vol}(P) t^d. We prove that a sufficient condition is that P tiles \mathbb R^d by translations, together with the Hyperoctahedral group.
