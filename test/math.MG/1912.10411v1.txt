The p-adic completion \mathbb{Q}_p of the rational numbers induces a different absolute value |\cdot|_p than the typical | \cdot | we have on the real numbers. In this paper we compare and contrast functions f \colon \mathbb{R}^{+} \to \mathbb{R}^{+}, for which the composition with the p-adic metric d_p generated by |\cdot|_p is still a metric on \mathbb{Q}_p, with the usual metric preserving functions and the functions that preserve the Euclidean metric on \mathbb{R}. In particular, it is shown that f \circ d_p is still an ultrametric on \mathbb{Q}_p if and only if there is a function g such that f \circ d_p = g \circ d_p and g \circ d is still an ultrametric for every ultrametric d. Some general variants of the last statement are also proved.
