We show that there exist constants \alpha,\epsilon>0 such that for every positive integer n there is a continuous odd function f:S^m\to S^n, with m\geq \alpha n, such that the \epsilon-expansion of the image of f does not contain a great circle. We also show how this result is connected to a conjecture of Vitali Milman about well-complemented almost Euclidean subspaces of spaces uniformly isomorphic to \ell_2^n.
