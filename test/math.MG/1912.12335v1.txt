It was proved in the first part of this work \cite{0} that Stolarsky's invariance principle, known previously for point distributions on the Euclidean spheres \cite{33}, can be extended to the real, complex, and quaternionic projective spaces and the octonionic projective plane. The geometric features of these spaces have been used very essentially in the proof. In the present paper, relying on the theory of spherical functions on such spaces, we give an alternative analytic proof of Stolarsky's invariance principle.
