The Gromov-Hausdorff distance (d_{GH}) proves to be a useful distance measure between shapes. In order to approximate d_{GH} for compact subsets X,Y\subset\mathbb{R}^d, we look into its relationship with d_{H,iso}, the infimum Hausdorff distance under Euclidean isometries. As already known for dimension d\geq 2, the d_{H,iso} cannot be bounded above by a constant factor times d_{GH}. For d=1, however, we prove that d_{H,iso}\leq\frac{5}{4}d_{GH}. We also show that the bound is tight. In effect, this gives rise to an O(n\log{n})-time algorithm to approximate d_{GH} with an approximation factor of \left(1+\frac{1}{4}\right).
