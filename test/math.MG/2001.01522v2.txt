In this note we give a short proof that graphs having no linearly small F{\o}lner sets can be partitioned into a union of expanders. We use this fact to prove a partition result for graphs admitting linearly small maximal F{\o}lner sets and we deduce that a family of such graphs must contain a family of expanders. We also show that the existence of partitions into expanders is a quasi-isometry invariant.
