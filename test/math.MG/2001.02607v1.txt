In 2010, Olson \& Robinson [Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 362(1), 145-168] introduced the notion of an almost homogeneous metric space and showed that if X is a subset of a Hilbert space such that X-X is almost homogeneous, then X admits almost bi--Lipschitz embeddings into Euclidean spaces. In this paper, we extend this result and we show that if X is a subset of a Banach space such that X-X is almost homogeneous at the origin, then X can be embedded in a Euclidean space in an almost bi--Lipschitz way.
