We prove that for any coarse spaces X_1,\dots,X_n of asymptotic dimension \ge 1, the product X=X_1\times\dots\times X_n has asymptotic dimension \ge n. Another result states that a finitary coare space Z has \mathrm{asdim}(Z)\ge n if Z admits an almost free action of the group \mathbb Z^n. We deduce these results from the following combinatorial result (that generalized the the Hex Theorem of Gale): for any cover \mathcal F of a discrete box K=k_1\times \dots \times k_n, either some set F\in\mathcal F contains a chain connecting two opposite faces of K or there exists a set B\subset K of diameter \le 1 such that |\{F\in\mathcal F:F\cap B\ne\emptyset\}|>n.
