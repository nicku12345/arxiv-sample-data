We construct a minimum tree for some boundary symmetric tetrahedra R^3, which has two nodes (interior points) with equal weights (positive numbers) having the property that the common perpendicular of some two opposite edges passes through their midpoints. We prove that the length of this minimum tree may have length less than the length of the full Steiner tree for the same boundary symmetric tetrahedra.
