Flag manifolds are generalizations of projective spaces and other Grassmannians: they parametrize flags, which are nested sequences of subspaces in a given vector space. These are important objects in algebraic and differential geometry, but are also increasingly being used in data science, where many types of data are properly understood as subspaces rather than vectors. In this paper we discuss partially oriented flag manifolds, which parametrize flags in which some of the subspaces may be endowed with an orientation. We compute the expected distance between random points on some low-dimensional examples, which we view as a statistical baseline against which to compare the distances between particular partially oriented flags coming from geometry or data.
