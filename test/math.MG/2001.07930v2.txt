We study the cases of equality and prove a rigidity theorem concerning the 1-Bakry-\'Emery inequality. As an application, we prove the rigidity of the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the Poincar\'e inequality in the setting of {\rm RCD}(K, \infty) metric measure spaces. This unifies and extends to the non-smooth setting the results of Carlen-Kerce, Morgan, Bouyrie, Ohta-Takatsu, Cheng-Zhou.   Examples of non-smooth spaces fitting our setting are measured-Gromov Hausdorff limits of Riemannian manifolds with uniform Ricci curvature lower bound, and Alexandrov spaces with curvature lower bound. Some results including the rigidity of \Phi-entropy inequalities, the rigidity of the 1-Bakry-\'Emery inequality are of independent interest even in the smooth setting.
