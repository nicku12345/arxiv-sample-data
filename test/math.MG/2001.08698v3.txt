The projection constant \Pi(E):=\Pi(E, \ell_\infty) of a finite-dimensional Banach space E\subset\ell_\infty is by definition the smallest norm of a linear projection of \ell_\infty onto E. Fix n\geq 1 and denote by \Pi_n the maximal value of \Pi(\cdot) amongst n-dimensional real Banach spaces. We prove for every \varepsilon >0 that there exist an integer d\geq 1 and an n-dimensional subspace E\subset\ell_1^d such that \Pi_n \leq \Pi(E, \ell_1^d) +2 \varepsilon and the orthogonal projection P\colon \ell_1^d\to E is almost minimal in the sense that \lVert P \rVert \leq \Pi(E, \ell_1^d)+\varepsilon. As a consequence of our main result, we obtain a formula relating \Pi_n to smallest absolute value row-sums of orthogonal projection matrices of rank n.
