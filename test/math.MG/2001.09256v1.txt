We prove a Poincar\'e, and a general Sobolev type inequalities for functions with compact support defined on a k-rectifiable varifold V defined on a complete Riemannian manifold with positive injectivity radius and sectional curvature bounded above. Our techniques allow us to consider Riemannian manifolds (M^n,g) with g of class C^2 or more regular, avoiding the use of Nash's isometric embedding theorem. Our analysis permits to do some quite important fragments of geometric measure theory also for those Riemannian manifolds carrying a C^2 metric g, that is not C^{k+\alpha} with k+\alpha>2. The class of varifolds we consider are those which first variation \delta V lies in an appropriate Lebesgue space L^p with respect to its weight measure \|V\| with the exponent p\in\mathbb{R} satisfying p>k.
