A polytope is the generalization of a polyhedron to any number of dimensions. The regular polyhedra are the Platonic solids: the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron. The hypercubes, hyperoctahedra, simplices, and regular polygons form four infinite fa milies of regular polytopes. Ludwig Schl\"afli proved that with the addition of five exceptional solids (the icosahedron and dodecahedron in 3 dimensions, and the 24-cell, 120-cell, and 600-cell in 4 dimensions) this list is complete. This paper provides an alternate proof to Schl\"afli's result, using Wythoff's construction and the theory of decorated Coxeter diagrams.
