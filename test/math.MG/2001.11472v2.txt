We show that every cross ratio preserving homeomorphism between boundaries of Hadamard manifolds extends to a continuous map, called circumcenter extension, provided that the manifolds satisfy certain visibility conditions. We show that this map is a rough isometry, whenever the manifolds admit cocompact group actions by isometries and we improve the quasi-isometry constants provided by Biswas in the case of CAT(-1)} spaces. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for this map to be an isometry in the case of Hadamard surfaces.
