Multifractal behavior has been identified and mathematically established for large classes of functions, stochastic processes and measures. Multifractality has also been observed on many data coming from Geophysics, turbulence, Physics, Biology, to name a few. Developing mathematical models whose scaling and multifractal properties fit those measured on data is thus an important issue. This raises several still unsolved theoretical questions about the prescription of multifractality (i.e. how to build mathematical models with a singularity spectrum known in advance), typical behavior in function spaces, and existence of solutions to PDEs or SPDEs with possible multifractal behavior. In this survey, we gather some of the latest results in this area. Dedicated to Alain Arn{\'e}odo, pioneer in the development of wavelet tools for data analysis.
