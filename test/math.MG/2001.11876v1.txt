Given a centered convex body K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n, we study the optimal value of the constant \tilde{\Lambda}(K) such that there exists an orthonormal basis \{w_i\}_{i=1}^n for which the following reverse dual Loomis-Whitney inequality holds:  |K|^{n-1}\leqslant \tilde{\Lambda}(K)\prod_{i=1}^n|K\cap w_i^\perp|.  We prove that \tilde{\Lambda}(K)\leqslant(CL_K)^n for some absolute C>1 and that this estimate in terms of L_K, the isotropic constant of K, is asymptotically sharp in the sense that there exists another absolute constant c>1 and a convex body K such that (cL_K)^n\leqslant\tilde{\Lambda}(K)\leqslant(CL_K)^n. We also prove more general reverse dual Loomis-Whitney inequalities as well as reverse restricted versions of Loomis-Whitney and dual Loomis-Whitney inequalities.
