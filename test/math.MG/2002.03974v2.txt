Non-orthogonal communication is a promising technique for future wireless networks (e.g., 6G and Wi-Fi 7). In the vector channel model, designing efficient non-orthogonal communication schemes amounts to the following extremum problem:\[ \max \min_k \frac{|v_k|^2}{\sigma^2 + \sum_{l \neq k} \langle v_k, v_l \rangle^2} \] where the maximum is taken among vector systems (v_k)_1^N \subset \mathbb{R}^d satisfying c_1 \leq |v_k|^2 \leq c_2 for every k, and the parameter \sigma>0 corresponds to the noise of the channel. We show that in the case \sigma = 0, uniform tight frames are the only optimal configurations. We also give quantitative bounds on how efficient these tight frames are for small values of~\sigma.
