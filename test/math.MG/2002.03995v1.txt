The action of the rotation group SO(3) on systems of n points in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space \mathbf{R}^3 induces naturally an action of SO(3) on \mathbf{R}^{3n}. In the present paper we consider the following question: do there exist 3 polynomial functions f_1, f_2, f_3 on \mathbf{R}^{3n} such that the intersection of the set of common zeros of f_1, f_2, and f_3 with each orbit of SO(3) in R^{3n} is nonempty and finite? Questions of this kind arise when one is interested in relative motions of a given set of n points, i.e., when one wants to exclude the local motions of the system of points as a rigid body. An example is the problem of deciding whether a given polyhedron is non-trivially flexible. We prove that such functions do exist. To get a necessary system of equations f_1=0, f_2=0, f_3=0, we show how starting by choice of a hypersurface in \mathbf{CP}^{n-1} containing no conics, no lines, and no real points one can find such a system.
