Motivated by classical Euler's Tonnetz, we introduce and study the combinatorics and topology of more general simplicial complexes Tonn^{n,k}(L) of "Tonnetz type". Out main result is that for a sufficiently generic choice of parameters the generalized tonnetz Tonn^{n,k}(L) is a triangulation of a (k-1)-dimensional torus T^{k-1}. In the proof we construct and use the properties of a "discrete Abel-Jacobi map", which takes values in the torus T^{k-1} \cong \mathbb{R}^{k-1}/\Lambda where \Lambda \cong \mathbb{A}^\ast_{k-1} is the permutohedral lattice.
