We show that if Y_j\subset \mathbb{C}^{n_j} is a bounded strongly convex domain with C^3-boundary for j=1,\dots,q, and X_j\subset \mathbb{C}^{m_j} is a bounded convex domain for j=1,\ldots,p, then the product domain \prod_{j=1}^p X_j\subset \mathbb{C}^m cannot be isometrically embedded into \prod_{j=1}^q Y_j\subset \mathbb{C}^n under the Kobayashi distance, if p>q. This result generalises Poincar\'e's theorem which says that there is no biholomorphic map from the polydisc onto the Euclidean ball in \mathbb{C}^n for n\geq 2.   The method of proof only relies on the metric geometry of the spaces and will be derived from a result for products of proper geodesic metric spaces with the sup-metric. In fact, the main goal of the paper is to establish a general criterion, in terms of certain asymptotic geometric properties of the individual metric spaces, that yields an obstruction for the existence of an isometric embedding between product metric spaces.
