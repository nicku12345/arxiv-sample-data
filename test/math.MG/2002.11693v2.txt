Suppose we choose N points uniformly randomly from a convex body in d dimensions. How large must N be, asymptotically with respect to d, so that the convex hull of the points is nearly as large as the convex body itself? It was shown by Dyer-F\"uredi-McDiarmid that exponentially many samples suffice when the convex body is the hypercube, and by Pivovarov that the Euclidean ball demands roughly d^{d/2} samples. We show that when the convex body is the simplex, exponentially many samples suffice; this then implies the same result for any convex simplicial polytope with at most exponentially many faces.
