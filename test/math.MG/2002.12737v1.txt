The \pi_2-diffeomorphism finiteness result (\cite{FR1,2}, \cite{PT}) asserts that the diffeomorphic types of compact n-manifolds M with vanishing first and second homotopy groups can be bounded above in terms of n, and upper bounds on the absolute value of sectional curvature and diameter of M. In this paper, we will generalize this \pi_2-diffeomorphism finiteness by removing the condition that \pi_1(M)=0 and asserting the diffeomorphism finiteness on the Riemannian universal cover of M.
