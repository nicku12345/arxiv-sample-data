Given a pair of metric tensors g_1 \ge g_0 on a Riemannian manifold, M, it is well known that \operatorname{Vol}_1(M) \ge \operatorname{Vol}_0(M). Furthermore one has rigidity: the volumes are equal if and only if the metric tensors are the same g_1=g_0. Here we prove that if g_j \ge g_0 and \operatorname{Vol}_1(M)\to \operatorname{Vol}_0(M) then (M,g_j) converge to (M,g_0) in the volume preserving intrinsic flat sense. Well known examples demonstrate that one need not obtain smooth, C^0, Lipschitz, or even Gromov-Hausdorff convergence in this setting. Our theorem may also be applied as a tool towards proving other open conjectures concerning the geometric stability of a variety of rigidity theorems in Riemannian geometry. To complete our proof, we provide a novel way of estimating the intrinsic flat distance between Riemannian manifolds which is interesting in its own right.
