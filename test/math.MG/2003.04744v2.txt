A line complex is a three-parameter set of lines in space, whose Pl\"ucker vectors lie in a hyperplane. The main result is an incidence bound O(n^{1/2}m^{3/4} + m+n\log m) for the number of incidences between n lines in a regular complex and m points in \mathbb F^3, where \mathbb F is any field, with n\leq char(\mathbb F) in positive characteristic. Zahl has recently discovered that bichromatic pair-wise incidences of lines coming from two distinct line complexes describe the nonzero single distance problem for a set of n points in \mathbb F^3 and proved a bound O(n^{3/2}) for the number of realisations of the distance, which is a square, for \mathbb F, where -1 is not a square. Our main theorem entails, under suitable constraints, a single distance bound O(n^{1.6}), which holds for any distance, including zero over any \mathbb F and incidence bound for isotropic lines in \mathbb F^3.
