We prove that if P,\mathcal{L} are finite sets of \delta-separated points and lines in \mathbb{R}^{2}, the number of \delta-incidences between P and \mathcal{L} is no larger than a constant times |P|^{2/3}|\mathcal{L}|^{2/3} \cdot \delta^{-1/3}. We apply the bound to obtain the following variant of the Loomis-Whitney inequality in the Heisenberg group:  |K| \lesssim |\pi_{x}(K)|^{2/3} \cdot |\pi_{y}(K)|^{2/3}, \qquad K \subset \mathbb{H}.  Here \pi_{x} and \pi_{y} are the vertical projections to the xt- and yt-planes, respectively, and |\cdot| refers to natural Haar measure on either \mathbb{H}, or one of the planes. Finally, as a corollary of the Loomis-Whitney inequality, we deduce that  \|f\|_{4/3} \lesssim \sqrt{\|Xf\| \|Yf\| }, \qquad f \in BV(\mathbb{H}),  where X,Y are the standard horizontal vector fields in \mathbb{H}. This is a sharper version of the classical geometric Sobolev inequality \|f\|_{4/3} \lesssim \|\nabla_{\mathbb{H}}f\| for f \in BV(\mathbb{H}).
