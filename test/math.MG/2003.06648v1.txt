A bar-joint framework (G,p) in \mathbb{R}^d is rigid if the only edge-length preserving continuous motions of the vertices arise from isometries of \mathbb{R}^d. It is known that, when (G,p) is generic, its rigidity depends only on the underlying graph G, and is determined by the rank of the edge set of G in the generic d-dimensional rigidity matroid \mathcal{R}_d. Complete combinatorial descriptions of the rank function of this matroid are known when d=1,2, and imply that all circuits in \mathcal{R}_d are generically rigid in \mathbb{R}^d when d=1,2. Determining the rank function of \mathcal{R}_d is a long standing open problem when d\geq 3, and the existence of non-rigid circuits in \mathcal{R}_d for d\geq 3 is a major contributing factor to why this problem is so difficult. We begin a study of non-rigid circuits by characterising the non-rigid circuits in \mathcal{R}_d which have at most d+6 vertices.
