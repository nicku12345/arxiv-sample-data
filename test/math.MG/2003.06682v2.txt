We consider the problem \inf\big\{ \int\!\!\int_\Omega (1 + |\nabla u(x,y)|^2)^{-1} dx dy : \text{ the function } u : \Omega \to \mathbb{R} \text{ is concave and } 0 \le u(x,y) \le M \text{ for all } (x,y) \in \Omega =\{ (x,y): x^2 + y^2 \le 1 \} \, \big\} (Newton's problem) and its generalizations. In the paper \cite{BrFK} it is proved that if a solution u is C^2 in an open set \mathcal{U} \subset \Omega then \det D^2u = 0 in \mathcal{U}. It follows that graph(u)\rfloor_\mathcal{U} does not contain extreme points of the subgraph of u.   In this paper we prove a somewhat stronger result. Namely, there exists a solution u possessing the following property. If u is C^1 in an open set \mathcal{U} \subset \Omega then graph(u\rfloor_\mathcal{U}) does not contain extreme points of the convex body C_u = \{ (x,y,z) :\, (x,y) \in \Omega,\ 0 \le z \le u(x,y) \}. As a consequence, we have C_u = \text{\rm Conv} (\overline{\text{\rm SingC_u}}), where SingC_u denotes the set of singular points of \partial C_u. We prove a similar result for a generalized Newton's problem.
