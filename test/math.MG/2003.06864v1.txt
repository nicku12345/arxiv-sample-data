Let K \in \R^d be a convex body, and assume that L is a randomly rotated and shifted integer lattice. Let K_L be the convex hull of the (random) points K \cap L. The mean width W(K_L) of K_L is investigated. The asymptotic order of the mean width difference W(\l K)-W((\l K)_L) is maximized by the order obtained by polytopes and minimized by the order for smooth convex sets as \l \to \infty.
