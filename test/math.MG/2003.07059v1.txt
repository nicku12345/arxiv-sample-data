We investigate criteria for circle packing(CP) types of disk triangulation graphs embedded into simply connected domains in  \mathbb{C}. In particular, by studying combinatorial curvature and the combinatorial Gauss-Bonnet theorem involving boundary turns, we show that a disk triangulation graph is CP parabolic if there is a positive sequence a_n such that \[ a_n \geq \sum_{v \in B_n} (\mbox{deg} v - 6) \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^n a_k} = \infty, \] where B_n is the combinatorial ball of radius n and centered at a fixed vertex. This criterion is sharp, and generalizes a conjecture by He and Schramm in their paper from 1995, which was later proved by Repp in 2001. We also give several criteria for CP hyperbolicity, one of which generalizes a theorem of He and Schramm, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for CP types of layered circle packings generalizing and confirming a criterion given by Siders in 1998.
