We prove that some classes of triangle-free Artin groups act properly on locally finite, finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes. In particular, this provides the first examples of Artin groups that are properly cubulated but cannot be cocompactly cubulated, even virtually. The existence of such a proper action has many interesting consequences for the group, notably the Haagerup property, and the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients.
