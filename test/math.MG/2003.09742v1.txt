If \Omega is the interior of a convex polygon in \mathbb{R}^{2} and f,g two asymptotic geodesics, we show that the distance function d\left(f\left(t\right),g\left(t\right)\right) is convex for t sufficiently large. The same result is obtained in the case \partial \Omega is of class C^{2} and the curvature of \partial \Omega at the point f\left(\infty\right)=g\left(\infty\right)  does not vanish. An example is provided for the necessity of the curvature assumption.
