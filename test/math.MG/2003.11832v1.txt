The average kissing number of \mathbb{R}^n is the supremum of the average degrees of contact graphs of packings of finitely many balls (of any radii) in \mathbb{R}^n. We provide an upper bound for the average kissing number based on semidefinite programming that improves previous bounds in dimensions 3, \ldots, 9. A very simple upper bound for the average kissing number is twice the kissing number; in dimensions 6, \ldots, 9 our new bound is the first to improve on this simple upper bound.
