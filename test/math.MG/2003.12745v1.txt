The order in which plane-filling curves visit points in the plane can be exploited to design efficient algorithms. Typically, the curves are useful because they preserve locality: points that are close to each other along the curve tend to be close to each other in the plane, and vice versa. However, sketches of plane-filling curves do not show this well: they are hard to read on different levels of detail and it is hard to see how far apart points are along the curve. This paper presents a software tool to produce compelling visualisations that may give more insight in the structure of the curves.
