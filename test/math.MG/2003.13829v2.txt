Let K be a bounded convex domain in \mathbb{R}^2 symmetric about the origin. The critical locus of K is defined to be the (non-empty compact) set of lattices \Lambda in \mathbb{R}^2 of smallest possible covolume such that \Lambda \cap K= \lbrace 0\rbrace. These are classical objects in geometry of numbers; yet all previously known examples of critical loci were either finite sets or finite unions of closed curves. In this paper we give a new construction which, in particular, furnishes examples of domains having critical locus of arbitrary Hausdorff dimension between 0 and 1.
