Motivated by a question of R.\ Nandakumar, we show that the Euclidean plane can be dissected into mutually incongruent convex quadrangles of the same area and the same perimeter. As a byproduct we obtain vertex-to-vertex dissections of the plane by mutually incongruent triangles of unit area that are arbitrarily close to the periodic vertex-to-vertex tiling by equilateral triangles.
