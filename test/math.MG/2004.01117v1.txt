Let \mu be a Radon measure on the n-th Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}^n. In this note we prove that if the (2n+1)-dimensional (Heisenberg) Riesz transform on \mathbb{H}^n is L^2(\mu)-bounded, and if \mu(F)=0 for all Borel sets with \dim_H(F)\leq 2, then \mu must have (2n+1)-polynomial growth. This is the Heisenberg counterpart of a result of Guy David from 1991.
