Tilings based on the cut and project method are key model systems for the description of aperiodic solids. Typically, quantities of interest in crystallography involve averaging over large patches, and are well defined only in the infinite-volume limit. In particular, this is the case for autocorrelation and diffraction measures. For cut and project systems, the averaging can conveniently be transferred to internal space, which means dealing with the corresponding windows. We illustrate this by the example of averaged shelling numbers for the Fibonacci tiling and review the standard approach to the diffraction for this example. Further, we discuss recent developments for inflation-symmetric cut and project structures, which are based on an internal counterpart of the renormalisation cocycle. Finally, we briefly review the notion of hyperuniformity, which has recently gained popularity, and its application to aperiodic structures.
