Within the class of reflexive Banach spaces, we prove a metric characterization of the class of asymptotic-c_0 spaces in terms of a bi-Lipschitz invariant which involves metrics that generalize the Hamming metric on k-subsets of \mathbb{N}. We apply this characterization to show that the class of separable, reflexive, and asymptotic-c_0 Banach spaces is non-Borel co-analytic. Finally, we introduce a relaxation of the asymptotic-c_0 property, called the asymptotic-subsequential-c_0 property, which is a partial obstruction to the equi-coarse embeddability of the sequence of Hamming graphs. We present examples of spaces that are asymptotic-subsequential-c_0. In particular T^*(T^*) is asymptotic-subsequential-c_0 where T^* is Tsirelson's original space.
