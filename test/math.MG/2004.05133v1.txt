The upper and lower Assouad dimensions of a metric space are local variants of the box dimensions of the space and provide quantitative information about the `thickest' and `thinnest' parts of the set. Less extreme versions of these dimensions for sets have been introduced, including the upper and lower quasi-Assouad dimensions, \theta -Assouad spectrum, and \Phi -dimensions. In this paper, we study the analogue of the upper and lower \Phi -dimensions for measures. We give general properties of such dimensions, as well as more specific results for self-similar measures satisfying various separation properties and discrete measures.
