Hilbert volume is an invariant of real projective geometry. Polygons inscribed in polygons are considered for the real projective plane. The correspondence between Fock-Goncharov and Cartesian coordinates is examined. Degeneration and Hilbert area of inscribed quadrilaterals are analyzed. A microlocal condition is developed for bounded Hilbert area under degeneration. The condition is applied to give a sequence of strictly convex domains with bounded Hilbert area and divergent Goldman parameters.
