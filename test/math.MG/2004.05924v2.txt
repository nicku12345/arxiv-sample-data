In this paper, we discuss a connection between geometric measure theory and number theory. This brings a new point of view for some number theoretic problems concerning digit expansions. As an example, we show that a problem posed by Graham on prime factors of binomial coefficients can be answered by considering a problem on projected images of fractal sets. From this point of view, among other results, we revisit a result obtained by Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa and Straus concerning binomial coefficients coprime with 15.
