Let \gamma_n be the standard Gaussian measure on \mathbb{R}^n. We prove that for every symmetric convex sets K,L in \mathbb{R}^n and every \lambda\in(0,1), \gamma_n(\lambda K+(1-\lambda)L)^{\frac{1}{n}} \geq \lambda \gamma_n(K)^{\frac{1}{n}}+(1-\lambda)\gamma_n(L)^{\frac{1}{n}}, thus settling a problem raised by Gardner and Zvavitch (2010). This is the Gaussian analogue of the classical Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the Lebesgue measure. We also show that, for a fixed \lambda\in(0,1), equality is attained if and only if K=L.
