We show that for any Carnot group G there exists a natural number D_G such that for any 0<\varepsilon<1/2 the metric space (G,d_G^{1-\varepsilon}) admits a bi-Lipschitz embedding into \mathbb{R}^{D_G} with distortion O_G(\varepsilon^{-1/2}). This is done by building on the approach of T. Tao (2018), who established the above assertion when G is the Heisenberg group using a new variant of the Nash--Moser iteration scheme combined with a new extension theorem for orthonormal vector fields. Beyond the need to overcome several technical issues that arise in the more general setting of Carnot groups, a key point where our proof departs from that of Tao is in the proof of the orthonormal vector field extension theorem, where we incorporate the Lov\'{a}sz local lemma and the concentration of measure phenomenon on the sphere in place of Tao's use of a quantitative homotopy argument.
