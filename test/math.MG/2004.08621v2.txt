Let M be a complete, connected Riemannian surface and suppose that \mathcal{S} \subset M is a discrete subset. What can we learn about M from the knowledge of all distances in the surface between pairs of points of \mathcal{S}? We prove that if the distances in \mathcal{S} correspond to the distances in a 2-dimensional lattice, or more generally in an arbitrary net in \mathbb{R}^2, then M is isometric to the Euclidean plane. We thus find that Riemannian embeddings of certain discrete metric spaces are rather rigid. A corollary is that a subset of \mathbb{Z}^3 that strictly contains \mathbb{Z}^2 \times \{ 0 \} cannot be isometrically embedded in any complete Riemannian surface.
