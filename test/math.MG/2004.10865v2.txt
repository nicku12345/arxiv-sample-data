In this paper we address the following shape optimization problem: find the planar domain of least area, among the sets with prescribed constant width and inradius. In the literature, the problem is ascribed to Bonnesen, who proposed it in \cite{BF}. In the present work, we give a complete answer to the problem, providing an explicit characterization of optimal sets for every choice of width and inradius. These optimal sets are particular Reuleaux polygons.
