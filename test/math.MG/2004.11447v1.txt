We show that the \beta--numbers of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs of Heisenberg groups \mathbb{H}_n are locally Carleson integrable when n \geq 2. Our technique relies on a recent Dorronsoro inequality \cite{FO} as well as a novel slicing argument. A key ingredient in our proof is a Euclidean inequality bounding the \beta--number of a function on a cube of \mathbb{R}^n using the \beta--number of the restriction of the function to codimension--1 slices of the cube.
