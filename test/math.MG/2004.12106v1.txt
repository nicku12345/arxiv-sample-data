Let P=A_1\ldots A_n be a generic polygon in three-dimensional space and let v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n be vectors \overline{A_1A_2},\overline{A_2A_3},\ldots,\overline{A_nA_1}, respectively. P will be called \emph{regular}, if there exist vectors u_1,\ldots,u_n such that cross products [u_1,u_2],[u_2,u_3],\ldots,[u_n,u_1] are equal to vectors v_2,v_3,\ldots,v_1, respectively. In this case the polygon P', defined be vectors u_2-u_1,u_3-u_2,\ldots,u_1-u_n will be called the \emph{derived polygon} or the \emph{derivative} of the polygon P. In this work we formulate conditions for regularity and discuss geometric properties of derived polygons for n=4,5,6.
