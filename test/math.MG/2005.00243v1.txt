During the last decade Optimal Transport had a relevant role in the study of geometry of singular spaces that culminated with the Lott-Sturm-Villani theory. The latter is built on the characterisation of Ricci curvature lower bounds in terms of displacement convexity of certain entropy functionals along W_{2}-geodesics. Substantial recent advancements in the theory (localization paradigm and local-to-global property) have been obtained considering the different point of view of L^1-Optimal transport problems yielding a different curvature dimension \mathsf{CD}^{1}(K,N) [8] formulated in terms of one-dimensional curvature properties of integral curves of Lipschitz maps. In this note we show that the two approaches produce the same curvature-dimension condition reconciling the two definitions. In particular we show that the \mathsf{CD}^{1}(K,N) condition can be formulated in terms of displacement convexity along W_{1}-geodesics.
