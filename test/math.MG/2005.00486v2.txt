We study dually epi-translation invariant valuations on cones of convex functions containing the space of finite-valued convex functions. The existence of a homogeneous decomposition is used to associate a distribution to every valuation of this type similar to the Goodey-Weil embedding for translation invariant valuations on convex bodies. The relation between the valuation and its associated distribution is used to establish a notion of support for valuations. As an application, we show that there are no \mathrm{SL}(n) or translation invariant valuations except constant valuations in this class and we discuss which valuations on finite-valued convex functions can be extended to larger cones. In addition, we examine some topological properties of spaces of valuations with compact support.
