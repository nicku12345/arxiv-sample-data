We show that an Ahlfors d-regular set E in \mathbb{R}^{n} is uniformly rectifiable if the set of pairs (x,r)\in E\times (0,\infty) for which there exists y \in B(x,r) and 0<t<r satisfying \mathscr{H}^{d}_{\infty}(E\cap B(y,t))<(2t)^{d}-\varepsilon(2r)^d is a Carleson set for every \varepsilon>0.   To prove this, we generalize a result of Schul by proving, if X is a C-doubling metric space, \varepsilon,\rho\in (0,1), A>1, and X_{n} is a sequence of maximal 2^{-n}-separated sets in X, and \mathscr{B}=\{B(x,2^{-n}):x\in X_{n},n\in \mathbb{N}\}, then \[ \sum \left\{r_{B}^{s}: B\in \mathscr{B}, \frac{\mathscr{H}^{s}_{\rho r_{B}}(X\cap AB)}{(2r_{B})^{s}}>1+\varepsilon\right\} \lesssim_{C,A,\varepsilon,\rho,s} \mathscr{H}^{s}(X). \] This is a quantitative version of the classical result that for a metric space X of finite s-dimensional Hausdorff measure, the upper s-dimensional densities are at most 1 \mathscr{H}^{s}-almost everywhere.
