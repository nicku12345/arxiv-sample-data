Motivated by long-standing conjectures on the discretization of classical inequalities in the Geometry of Numbers, we investigate a new set of parameters, which we call \emph{packing minima}, associated to a convex body K and a lattice \Lambda. These numbers interpolate between the successive minima of K and the inverse of the successive minima of the polar body of K, and can be understood as packing counterparts to the covering minima of Kannan & Lov\'{a}sz (1988). As our main results, we prove sharp inequalities that relate the volume and the number of lattice points in K to the sequence of packing minima. Moreover, we extend classical transference bounds and discuss a natural class of examples in detail.
