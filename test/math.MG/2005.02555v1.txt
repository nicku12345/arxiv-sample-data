A closed PL-curve is called integral if it is comprised of unit intervals. Kenyon's problem asks whether for every integral curve \gamma in \mathbb{R}^3, there is a dome over \gamma, i.e. whether \gamma is a boundary of a polyhedral surface whose faces are equilateral triangles with unit edge lengths. First, we give an algebraic necessary condition when \gamma is a quadrilateral, thus giving a negative solution to Kenyon's problem in full generality. We then prove that domes exist over a dense set of integral curves. Finally, we give an explicit construction of domes over all regular n-gons.
