Let S be a set of points in \mathbb{R}^2 contained in a circle and P an unrestricted point set in \mathbb{R}^2. We prove the number of distinct distances between points in S and points in P is at least \min(|S||P|^{1/4-\varepsilon},|S|^{2/3}|P|^{2/3},|S|^2,|P|^2).   This builds on work of Pach and De Zeeuw, Bruner and Sharir, McLaughlin and Omar and Mathialagan on distances between pairs of sets.
