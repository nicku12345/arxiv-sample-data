For fixed k we prove exponential lower bounds on the equilateral number of subspaces of \ell_{\infty}^n of codimension k. In particular, we show that if the unit ball of a normed space of dimension n is a centrally symmetric polytope with at most \frac{4n}{3}-o(n) pairs of facets, then it has an equilateral set of cardinality at least n+1. These include subspaces of codimension 2 of \ell_{\infty}^{n+2} for n\geq 9 and of codimension 3 of \ell_{\infty}^{n+3} for n\geq 15.
