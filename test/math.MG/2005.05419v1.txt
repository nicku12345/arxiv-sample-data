We study real-valued valuations on the space of Lipschitz functions over the Euclidean unit sphere S^{n-1}. After introducing an appropriate notion of convergence, we show that continuous valuations are bounded on sets which are bounded with respect to the Lipschitz norm. This fact, in combination with measure theoretical arguments, will yield an integral representation for continuous and rotation invariant valuations on the space of Lipschitz functions over the 1-dimensional sphere.
