Let (\mathcal{M}, c_k, n_k,\kappa) be a class of homogeneous Moran sets. Suppose f(x,y)\in C^3 is a function defined on \mathbb{R}^2. Given E_1, E_2\in(\mathcal{M}, c_k, n_k,\kappa) , in this paper, we prove, under some checkable conditions on the partial derivatives of f(x,y), that f(E_1,E_2)=\{f(x,y):x\in E_1,y\in E_2\} is exactly a closed interval or a union of finitely many closed intervals. Similar results for the homogeneous self-similar sets with arbitrary overlaps can be obtained. Further generalization is available for some inhomogeneous self-similar sets if we utilize the approximation theorem.
