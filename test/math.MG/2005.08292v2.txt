We prove that the volume of central hyperplane sections of a unit cube in \mathbb{R}^n orthogonal to a diameter of the cube is a strictly monotonically increasing function of the dimension for n\geq 3. Our argument uses an integral formula that goes back to P\'olya \cite{P} (see also \cite{H} and \cite{B86}) for the volume of central sections of the cube, and Laplace's method to estimate the asymptotic behaviour of the integral. First we show that monotonicity holds starting from some specific n_0. Then, using interval arithmetic (IA) and automatic differentiation (AD), we compute an explicit bound for n_0, and check the remaining cases between 3 and n_0 by direct computation.
