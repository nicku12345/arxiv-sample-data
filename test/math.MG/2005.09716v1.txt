Let X be a connected, locally finite graph with symmetric growth. We prove that there is a vertex coloring \phi\colon X\to\{0,1\} and some R\in\mathbb{N} such that every automorphism f preserving \phi is R-close to the identity map; this can be seen as a coarse geometric version of symmetry breaking. We also prove that the infinite motion conjecture is true for graphs where at least one vertex stabilizer S_x satisfies the following condition: for every non-identity automorphism f\in S_x, there is a sequence x_n such that \lim d(x_n,f(x_n))=\infty.
