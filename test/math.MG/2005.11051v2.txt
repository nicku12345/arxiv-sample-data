We consider the problem of characterising the generic rigidity of bar-joint frameworks in \mathbb{R}^d in which each vertex is constrained to lie in a given affine subspace. The special case when d=2 was previously solved by I. Streinu and L. Theran in 2010 and the case when each vertex is constrained to lie in an affine subspace of dimension t, and d\geq t(t-1) was solved by Cruickshank, Guler and the first two authors in 2019. We extend the latter result by showing that the given characterisation holds whenever d\geq 2t.
