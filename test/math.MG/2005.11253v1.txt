Let B_{x}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n} denote the Euclidean ball with diameter [0,x], i.e. with with center at \frac{x}{2} and radius \frac{\left|x\right|}{2}. We call such a ball a petal. A flower F is any union of petals, i.e. F=\bigcup_{x\in A}B_{x} for any set A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}. We showed in previous work that the family of all flowers \mathcal{F} is in 1-1 correspondence with \mathcal{K}_{0} - the family of all convex bodies containing 0. Actually, there are two essentially different such correspondences. We demonstrate a number of different non-linear constructions on \mathcal{F} and \mathcal{K}_{0}. Towards this goal we further develop the theory of flowers.
