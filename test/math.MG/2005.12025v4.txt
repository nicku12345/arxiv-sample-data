In 2013 Andriy V. Bondarenko showed how to construct a two-distance counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture from a strongly regular graph whose vertex set is not the union of at most f+1 cliques (sets of pairwise adjacent vertices) where f is the multiplicity of the second-largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix.   He applied that construction to those two graphs (on 416 and 31671 vertices, resp.) that he had been able to prove to fulfill the condition.   I do not know of any other publication proving or even asserting that another strongly regular graph fulfills the condition.   In a paper from 2018, D. Crnkovi\'{c}, S. Rukavina and A. \v{S}vob constructed in particular a certain up to then unknown strongly regular graph on 28431 vertices.   This article describes a (mainly computational, using an additionally (in the source package) provided input file for the GAP system) partial exploration of that graph and derives counterexamples in dimensions down to 774 from it.
