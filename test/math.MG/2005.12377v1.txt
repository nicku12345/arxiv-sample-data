In this paper the concept of homothetic parallelogram is introduced. This concept is a generalization of Varignon's and Wittenbauer's parallelograms of an arbitrary quadrangle, whose diagonals are not parallel. A formula for the area and perimeter of a homothetic parallelogram for the case when quadrangles are not crossed is obtained. The fact that homothetic parallelograms are similar to one another and are in perspective from diagonals intersection point is proved.
