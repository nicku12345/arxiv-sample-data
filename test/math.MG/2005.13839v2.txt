In this article we show the following result: if C is an n-dimensional convex and compact subset, f:C\rightarrow[0,\infty) is concave, and \phi:[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty) is a convex function with \phi(0)=0, we then characterize the class of sets and concave functions that attain the supremum \[ \sup_{C,f}\int_C\phi(f(x))dx, \] where the supremum ranges over all sets C with n-dimensional volume |C|=c and the additional condition that f(x_{C,f})=k for some point x_{C,f}\in C that we introduce in the article, for two non-negative constants c,k>0.   As a consequence, we extend some results of Milman and Pajor in [MP] and some in [Thm. 1.2, GoMe]. Besides, we also obtain some new estimates on the volume of particular sections of a convex set K passing through a new point of K.
