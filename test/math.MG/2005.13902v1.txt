We consider weakly and strongly asymptotically mean value harmonic (amv-harmonic) functions on metric measure spaces which, in the classical setting, are known to coincide with harmonic functions.   We demonstrate that, in non-collapsed RCD-spaces with vanishing metric measure boundary, Cheeger harmonic functions are weakly amv-harmonic and that, in Carnot groups, weak amv-harmonicity equivalently characterizes harmonicity in the sense of the sub-Laplacian. Moreover, in the first Heisenberg group, we prove a Blaschke--Privaloff--Zaremba type theorem which yields the equivalence of both weak and strong amv-harmonicity with harmonicity in the sense of the sub-Laplacian.   In doubling metric measure spaces we show that strongly amv-harmonic functions are H\"older continuous for any exponent below one. More generally, we define the class of functions with finite amv-norm and show that functions in this class belong to a fractional Hajlasz--Sobolev space and their blow-ups satisfy the mean-value property.   In the toy model case of weighted Euclidean domains, we identify the elliptic PDE characterizing amv-harmonic functions, and use this to point out that Cheeger harmonic functions in RCD-spaces need not be weakly amv-harmonic without the non-collapsing condition.
