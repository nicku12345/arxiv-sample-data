We carry out a numerical study of the spinless modular bootstrap for conformal field theories with current algebra U(1)^c \times U(1)^c, or equivalently the linear programming bound for sphere packing in 2c dimensions. We give a more detailed picture of the behavior for finite c than was previously available, and we extrapolate as c \to \infty. Our extrapolation indicates an exponential improvement for sphere packing density bounds in high dimensions. Furthermore, we study when these bounds can be tight. Besides the known cases c=1/2, 4, and 12 and the conjectured case c=1, our calculations numerically rule out sharp bounds for all other c<90, by combining the modular bootstrap with linear programming bounds for spherical codes.
