We consider a uniformly rectifiable set \Gamma \subset \mathbb R^n of dimension d<n-1. By using degenerate elliptic operators on the complement \Omega = \mathbb R^n \setminus \Gamma, Guy David, Svitlana Mayboroda, and the author introduced a notion of harmonic measure on \Gamma.   We prove in the present article that this harmonic measure on \Gamma satisfies the A^\infty-property, that is the harmonic measure and the d-dimension Hausdorff measure on \Gamma are mutually absolutely continuous in a quantitative and scale invariant way. Thus, we give an alternate proof of a recent theorem of David and Mayboroda, which itself extends a result of Hofmann and Martell to the case where the uniformly rectifiable set \Gamma is not of codimension 1.   The proof is surprisingly simple - in particular does not follow the route used by David and Mayboroda, or by Hofmann and Martell - but is specific to the case when d<n-1.
