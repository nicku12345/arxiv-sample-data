Starting with a finite point set X \subset \mathbf{R}^d, the peeling process repeatedly removes the set of the vertices of the convex hull of the current set. The number of peeling steps required to completely remove X is called the layer number of X, denoted by L(X). In the article, we study the layer number of evenly distributed families of point sets contained in B^d, the d-dimensional unit ball. These sets consist of points in B^d whose minimal distance is asymptotically as large as possible. We show that for a set X belonging to an evenly distributed family, L(X) \geq \Omega(|X|^{1/d}) holds, with the bound being asymptotically sharp. On the other hand, building on earlier results, we prove that L(X)\leq O(|X|^{2/d}) holds for d\geq 2, which improves greatly on the current upper bound of O(|X|^{(d+1)/2d}) for d \geq 3. Finally, we provide a recursive construction of evenly distributed families whose sets satisfy L(X) = \Theta(|X|^{2/d - 1/(d 2^{d-1})}), showing that our upper bound is nearly tight.
