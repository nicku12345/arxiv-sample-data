Bochner's theorem says that if M is a compact Riemannian manifold with negative Ricci curvature, then the isometry group \operatorname{Iso}(M) is finite. In this article, we show that if (X,d,m) is a compact metric measure space with synthetic negative Ricci curvature in Sturm's sense, then the measure preserving isometry group \operatorname{Iso}(X,d,m) is finite. We also give an effective estimate on the order of the measure preserving isometry group for a compact weighted Riemannian manifold with negative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature except for small portions.
