We study the problem of determining the maximum size of a spherical two-distance set with two fixed angles (one acute and one obtuse) in high dimensions. Let N_{\alpha,\beta}(d) denote the maximum number of unit vectors in \mathbb R^d where all pairwise inner products lie in \{\alpha,\beta\}. For fixed -1\leq\beta<0\leq\alpha<1, we propose a conjecture for the limit of N_{\alpha,\beta}(d)/d as d \to \infty in terms of eigenvalue multiplicities of signed graphs. We determine this limit when \alpha+2\beta<0 or (1-\alpha)/(\alpha-\beta) \in \{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}\}.   Our work builds on our recent resolution of the problem in the case of \alpha = -\beta (corresponding to equiangular lines). It is the first determination of \lim_{d \to \infty} N_{\alpha,\beta}(d)/d for any nontrivial fixed values of \alpha and \beta outside of the equiangular lines setting.
