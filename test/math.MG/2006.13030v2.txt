Given a compact, connected, and oriented manifold with boundary M and a sequence of smooth Riemannian metrics defined on it, g_j, we prove volume preserving intrinsic flat convergence of the sequence to the smooth Riemannian metric g_0 provided g_j always measures vectors strictly larger than or equal to g_0, the diameter of g_j is uniformly bounded, the volume of g_j converges to the volume of g_0, and L^{\frac{m-1}{2}} convergence of the metrics restricted to the boundary. Many examples are reviewed which justify and explain the intuition behind these hypotheses. These examples also show that uniform, Lipschitz, and Gromov-Hausdorff convergence are not appropriate in this setting. Our results provide a new rigorous method of proving some special cases of the intrinsic flat stability of the positive mass theorem.
