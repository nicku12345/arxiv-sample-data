Let \mu be an Ahlfors-David probability measure on \mathbb{R}^q with support K. For every n\geq 1, let C_n(\mu) denote the collection of all the n-optimal sets for \mu with respect to the geometric mean error. We prove that, there exist constant d_1,d_2>0, such that for each n\geq 1, every \alpha_n\in C_n(\mu) and an arbitrary Voronoi partition \{P_a(\alpha_n)\}_{a\in\alpha_n} with respect to \alpha_n, we have \[ d_1n^{-1}\leq\min_{a\in\alpha_n}\mu(P_a(\alpha_n))\leq\max_{a\in\alpha_n}\mu(P_a(\alpha_n))\leq d_2n^{-1}. \] Moreover, we prove that each P_a(\alpha_n) contains a closed ball of radius d_3|P_a(\alpha_n)\cap K|, where d_3 is a constant and |B| denotes the diameter of a set B\subset\mathbb{R}^q. Some estimates for the measure and the geometrical size of the elements of a Voronoi partition with respect to an n-optimal set are established in a more general context.
