We study an isomorphism between the group of rigid body displacements and the group of dual quaternions modulo the dual number multiplicative group from the viewpoint of differential geometry in a projective space over the dual numbers. Some seemingly weird phenomena in this space have lucid kinematic interpretations. An example is the existence of non-straight curves with a continuum of osculating tangents which correspond to motions in a cylinder group with osculating vertical Darboux motions. We also suggest geometrically meaningful ways to select osculating conics of a curve in this projective space and illustrate their corresponding motions. Furthermore, we investigate factorizability of these special motions and use the obtained results for the construction of overconstrained linkages.
