We study the geodesic complexity of the ordered and unordered configuration spaces of graphs in both the \ell_1 and \ell_2 metrics. We determine the geodesic complexity of the ordered two-point \varepsilon-configuration space of any star graph in both the \ell_1 and \ell_2 metrics and of the unordered two-point configuration space of any tree in the \ell_1 metric, by finding explicit geodesics from any pair to any other pair, and arranging them into a minimal number of continuously-varying families. In each case the geodesic complexity matches the known value of the topological complexity.
