For a complete Riemannian manifold with bounded geometry, we prove the existence of isoperimetric clusters and also the compactness theorem for sequence of clusters in a larger space obtained by adding finitely many limit manifolds at infinity. Moreover, we show that isoperimetric clusters are bounded. As far as we know, we introduce for the first time in the literature the multi-isoperimetric profile and prove its H\"{o}lder continuity. We yield a proof of classical existence theorem, e.g. in space forms, for isoperimetric cluster using the results presented here. The results in this work generalize previous works of Stefano Nardulli, Andrea Mondino, Frank Morgan, Matteo Galli and Manuel Ritor\'e from the classical Riemannian and sub-Riemannian isoperimetric problem to the context of Riemannian isoperimetric clusters and also Frank Morgan and Francesco Maggi works on the clusters theory in the Euclidean setting.
