We prove that if \alpha\in (0,1/2], then the packing dimension of a set E\subset\mathbb{R}^2 for which there exists a set of lines of dimension 1 intersecting E in dimension \ge \alpha is at least 1/2+\alpha+c(\alpha) for some c(\alpha)>0. In particular, this holds for \alpha-Furstenberg sets, that is, sets having intersection of Hausdorff dimension \ge\alpha with at least one line in every direction. Together with an earlier result of T. Orponen, this provides an improvement for the packing dimension of \alpha-Furstenberg sets over the "trivial" estimate for all values of \alpha\in (0,1). The proof extends to more general families of lines, and shows that the scales at which an \alpha-Furstenberg set resembles a set of dimension close to 1/2+\alpha, if they exist, are rather sparse.
