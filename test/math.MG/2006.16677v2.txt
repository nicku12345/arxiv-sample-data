In his 1990 paper, Jones proved the following: given E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2, there exists a curve \Gamma such that E \subseteq \Gamma and \[ \mathscr{H}^1(\Gamma) \sim \text{diam}\, E + \sum_{Q} \beta_{E}(3Q)^2\ell(Q).\] Here, \beta_E(Q) measures how far E deviates from a straight line inside Q. This was extended by Okikiolu to subsets of \mathbb{R}^n and by Schul to subsets of a Hilbert space.   In 2018, Azzam and Schul introduced a variant of the Jones \beta-number. With this, they, and separately Villa, proved similar results for lower regular subsets of \mathbb{R}^n. In particular, Villa proved that, given E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n which is lower content regular, there exists a `nice' d-dimensional surface F such that E \subseteq F and \begin{align} \mathscr{H}^d(F) \sim \text{diam}( E)^d + \sum_{Q} \beta_{E}(3Q)^2\ell(Q)^d. \end{align} In this context, a set F is `nice' if it satisfies a certain topological non degeneracy condition, first introduced in a 2004 paper of David.   In this paper we drop the lower regularity condition and prove an analogous result for general d-dimensional subsets of \mathbb{R}^n. To do this, we introduce a new d-dimensional variant of the Jones \beta-number that is defined for any set in \mathbb{R}^n.
