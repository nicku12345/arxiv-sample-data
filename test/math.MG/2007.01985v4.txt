We say that the sequence of groups \Gamma_n acts almost transitively on a sequence of proper metric spaces X_n if for every n, there is an isometric discrete cocompact action of \Gamma_n on X_n such that the diameters of the quotients X_n / \Gamma_n  converge to 0 as n \to \infty.   In such a case, we prove that if the sequence X_n consists of length spaces and converges in the pointed Gromov--Hausdorff sense to a proper length space X, then X is isometric to a nilpotent locally compact group equipped with an invariant length metric.   Furthermore, assuming X is either finite dimensional or semilocally simply connected, we show that it is a Lie group equipped with a Finsler or sub-Finsler metric, and for large enough n, there are subgroups \Lambda_n \leq \pi_1(X_n) with surjective morphisms \Lambda_n\to \pi_1(X).
