Given n distinct points \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n in \mathbb{R}^d, let K denote their convex hull, which we assume to be d-dimensional, and B = \partial K  its (d-1)-dimensional boundary. We construct an explicit one-parameter family of continuous maps \mathbf{f}_{\varepsilon} \colon \mathbb{S}^{d-1} \to K which, for \varepsilon > 0, are defined on the (d-1)-dimensional sphere and have the property that the images \mathbf{f}_{\varepsilon}(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}) are codimension 1 submanifolds contained in the interior of K. Moreover, as the parameter \varepsilon goes to 0^+, the images \mathbf{f}_{\varepsilon}(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}) converge, as sets, to the boundary B of the convex hull. We prove this theorem using techniques from convex geometry of (spherical) polytopes and set-valued homology. We further establish an interesting relationship with the Gauss map of the polytope B, appropriately defined. Several computer plots illustrating our results will be presented.
