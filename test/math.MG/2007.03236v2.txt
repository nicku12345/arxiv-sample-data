This paper is devoted to show that the flatness of tangents of 1-codimensional measures in Carnot Groups implies C^1_\mathbb{G}-rectifiability. As applications we prove that measures with (2n+1)-density in the Heisenberg groups \mathbb{H}^n are C^1_{\mathbb{H}^n}-rectifiable, providing the first non-Euclidean extension of Preiss's rectifiability theorem and a criterion for intrinsic Lipschitz rectifiability of finite perimeter sets in general Carnot groups.
