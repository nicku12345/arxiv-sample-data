The interior angle vector (\widehat{\alpha}-vector) of a polytope is a metric analogue of the f-vector in which faces are weighted by their solid angle. For simplicial polytopes, Dehn-Sommerville-type relations on the \widehat{\alpha}-vector were introduced by Sommerville (1927) and H\"ohn (1953). Camenga (2006) defined the \widehat{\gamma}-vector, a linear transformation analogous to the h-vector and conjectured it to be non-negative. Using tools from geometric and algebraic combinatorics, we prove this conjecture and show that the \widehat{\gamma}-vector increases in the first half and is flawless. In contrast to the h-vector, we construct a six-dimensional polytope with non-unimodal \widehat{\gamma}-vector. More generally, all result remain valid when solid angles are replaced by simple and non-negative cone valuations.
