This article is a continuation of our article in [Canad. J. Math. Vol. 72 (3), (2020), pp. 774--804]. We construct orthogonal bases of the cycle and cut spaces of the Laakso graph \mathcal{L}_n. They are used to analyze projections from the edge space onto the cycle space and to obtain reasonably sharp estimates of the projection constant of \operatorname{Lip}_0(\mathcal{L}_n), the space of Lipschitz functions on \mathcal{L}_n. We deduce that the Banach-Mazur distance from TC(\mathcal{L}_n), the transportation cost space of \mathcal{L}_n, to \ell_1^N of the same dimension is at least (3n-5)/8, which is the analogue of a result from [op. cit.] for the diamond graph D_n. We calculate the exact projection constants of \operatorname{Lip}_0(D_{n,k}), where D_{n,k} is the diamond graph of branching k. We also provide simple examples of finite metric spaces, transportation cost spaces on which contain \ell_\infty^3 and \ell_\infty^4 isometrically.
