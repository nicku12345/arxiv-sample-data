We have shown recently that, given a metric space X, the coarse equivalence classes of metrics on the two copies of X form an inverse semigroup M(X). Here we give several descriptions of the set E(M(X)) of idempotents of this inverse semigroup and its Stone dual space \widehat X. We also construct \sigma-additive measures on \widehat X from finitely additive probability measures on X that vanish on bounded subsets.
