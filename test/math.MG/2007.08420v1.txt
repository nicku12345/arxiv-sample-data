Given metric quotients S and S_n, n \in \mathbb{N}, of a metric space X, sufficient conditions are provided on the data defining them guaranteeing that S is the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of S_n. These conditions are recognized within metric quotients of plane polygons determined by side-pairings known as plain paper-folding schemes. In particular, concrete examples are given of sequences of two-dimensional conic-flat spheres converging to spheres that are conic-flat except around certain singularities, some of them with unbounded curvature in the sense of comparative geometry.
