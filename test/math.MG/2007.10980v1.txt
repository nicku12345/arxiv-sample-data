The celebrated Lott-Sturm-Villani theory of metric measure spaces furnishes synthetic notions of a Ricci curvature lower bound K joint with an upper bound N on the dimension. Their condition, called the Curvature-Dimension condition and denoted by \mathrm{CD}(K,N), is formulated in terms of a modified displacement convexity of an entropy functional along W_{2}-Wasserstein geodesics. We show that the choice of the squared-distance function as transport cost does not influence the theory. By denoting with \mathrm{CD}_{p}(K,N) the analogous condition but with the cost as the p^{th} power of the distance, we show that \mathrm{CD}_{p}(K,N) are all equivalent conditions for any p>1 -- at least in spaces whose geodesics do not branch. We show that the trait d'union between all the seemingly unrelated \mathrm{CD}_{p}(K,N) conditions is the needle decomposition or localization technique associated to the L^{1}-optimal transport problem. We also establish the local-to-global property of \mathrm{CD}_{p}(K,N) spaces.
