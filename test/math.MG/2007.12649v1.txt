We introduce a new family of algebraic varieties, L_{d,n}, which we call the unsquared measurement varieties. This family is parameterized by a number of points n and a dimension d. These varieties arise naturally from problems in rigidity theory and distance geometry. In those applications, it can be useful to understand the group of linear automorphisms of L_{d,n}. Notably, a result of Regge implies that L_{2,4} has an unexpected linear automorphism. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the linear automorphisms of L_{d,n} for all n and d. We show, that apart from L_{2,4} the unsquared measurement varieties have no unexpected automorphisms. Moreover, for L_{2,4} we characterize the full automorphism group.
