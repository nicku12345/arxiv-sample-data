In this paper we use a generating function approach to record and calculate entries of the Minkowski tensors of a polytope. We focus on ''surface tensors'', extending the methods used in arXiv:1807.10258 for moments of the uniform distribution which correspond to volume tensors. In this context we also extend the definition of the adjoint polynomial to the boundary complex of a polytope with simplicial facets. In the case of simplicial polytopes we give an explicit formulation for these surface tensors.
