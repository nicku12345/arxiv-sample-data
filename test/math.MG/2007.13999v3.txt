A finite subset X on the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^{d-1} is called an s-distance set with strength t if its angle set A(X):=\{\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle : \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in X,\mathbf{x}\neq\mathbf{y} \} has size s, and X is a spherical t-design but not a spherical (t+1)-design. In this paper, we consider to estimate the maximum size of such antipodal set for small s. First, we improve the known bound on |X| for each even integer s\in[\frac{t+5}{2}, t+1] when t\geq 3. We next focus on two special cases: s=3,\ t=3 and s=4,\ t=5. Estimating the size of X for these two cases is equivalent to estimating the size of real equiangular tight frames (ETFs) and Levenstein-equality packings, respectively. We first improve the previous estimate on the size of real ETFs and Levenstein-equality packings. This in turn gives a bound on |X| when s=3,\ t=3 and s=4,\ t=5, respectively.
