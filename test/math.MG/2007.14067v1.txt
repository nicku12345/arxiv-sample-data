For a polygon x=(x_j)_{j\in \mathbb{Z}} in \mathbb{R}^n we consider the midpoints polygon (M(x))_j=\left(x_j+x_{j+1}\right)/2\,. We call a polygon a soliton of the midpoints mapping M if its midpoints polygon is the image of the polygon under an invertible affine map. We show that a large class of these polygons lie on an orbit of a one-parameter subgroup of the affine group acting on \mathbb{R}^n. These smooth curves are also characterized as solutions of the differential equation \dot{c}(t)=Bc (t)+d for a matrix B and a vector d. For n=2 these curves are curves of constant generalized-affine curvature k_{ga}=k_{ga}(B) depending on B parametrized by generalized-affine arc length unless they are parametrizations of a parabola, an ellipse, or a hyperbola.
