In this paper we study connections between Besov spaces of functions on a compact metric space Z, equipped with a doubling measure, and the Newton--Sobolev space of functions on a uniform domain X_\varepsilon. This uniform domain is obtained as a uniformization of a (Gromov) hyperbolic filling of Z. To do so, we construct a family of hyperbolic fillings in the style of the work of Bonk and Kleiner and the work of Bourdon and Pajot. Then for each parameter \beta>0 we construct a lift \mu_\beta of the doubling measure \nu on Z to X_\varepsilon, and show that \mu_\beta is doubling and supports a 1-Poincar\'e inequality. We then show that for each \theta with 0<\theta<1 and p\ge 1 there is a choice of \beta=p(1-\theta)\log\alpha such that the Besov space B^\theta_{p,p}(Z) is the trace space of the Newton--Sobolev space N^{1,p}(X_\varepsilon,\mu_\beta) when \varepsilon=\log\alpha. Finally, we exploit the tools of potential theory on X_\varepsilon to obtain fine properties of functions in B^\theta_{p,p}(Z), such as their quasicontinuity and quasieverywhere existence of L^q-Lebesgue points with q=s_\nu p/(s_\nu-p\theta), where s_\nu is a doubling dimension associated with the measure \nu on Z. Applying this to compact subsets of Euclidean spaces improves upon a result of Netrusov in \mathbb{R}^n.
