We give an alternative proof for discrete Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities, recently obtained by Halikias, Klartag and the author. This proof also implies stronger weighted versions of these inequalities. Our approach generalizes the ideas of Gozlan, Roberto, Samson and Tetali from the theory of optimal transportation and provides new displacement convexity of entropy type inequalities for the lattice point enumerator.
