By combining theoretical and computational techniques from geometry, calculus, group theory, and Galois theory, we prove the nonexistence of a closed-form algebraic solution to a Japanese geometry problem first stated in the early nineteenth century. This resolves an outstanding problem from the sangaku tablets which were at one time displayed in temples and shrines throughout Japan.
