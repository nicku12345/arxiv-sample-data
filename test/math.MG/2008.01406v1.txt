In this note, we investigate the hyperbolizations of unbounded noncomplete metric spaces associated to three hyperbolic type metrics: hyperbolization metric h introduced by Ibragimov, \widetilde{j}-metric and the quasihyperbolic metric k. We show that for such a space (X,d), \partial X\cup\{\infty\}, \partial_h X, \partial_{\widetilde{j}}X are mutually quasisymmetrically equivalent with respect to the metric d and certain Hamenst\"adt metrics on the boundaries at infinity of these two hyperbolic spaces, respectively. Moreover, \partial X\cup\{\infty\} is also quasisymmetrically equivalent to Gromov boundary \partial_k X equipped with certain Hamenst\"adt metric whenever X is uniform. As an application, we get a characterization of unbounded uniform domains in Banach spaces.
