We show that the Banach-Mazur distance between the parallelogram and the affine-regular hexagon is \frac{3}{2} and we conclude that the diameter of the family of centrally-symmetric planar convex bodies is just \frac{3}{2}. A proof of this fact does not seem to be published earlier. Asplund announced this without a proof in his paper proving that the Banach-Mazur distance of any planar centrally-symmetric bodies is at most \frac{3}{2}. Analogously, we deal with the Banach-Mazur distances between the parallelogram and the remaining affine-regular even-gons.
