We introduce a generalization for bounded geometry that we call bounded scale measure. From there we show that it is a coarse invariant, equivalent definitions for bounded scale measures, and what properties it satisfies. We lastly look at generalizations of property A for uniformly discrete metric spaces to large scale spaces with bounded geometry, and finally for a space that satisfies bounded scale measure. We show these generalizations are coarse invariants among other things.
