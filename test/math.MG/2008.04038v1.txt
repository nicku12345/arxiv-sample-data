We consider the metric transformation of metric measure spaces/pyramids. We clarify the conditions to obtain the convergence of the sequence of transformed spaces from that of the original sequence, and, conversely, to obtain the convergence of the original sequence from that of the transformed sequence, respectively. As an application, we prove that spheres and projective spaces with standard Riemannian distance converge to a Gaussian space and the Hopf quotient of a Gaussian space, respectively, as the dimension diverges to infinity.
