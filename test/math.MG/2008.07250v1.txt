A vertex-transitive graph \mathcal{G} is called Local-to-Global rigid if there exists R>0 such that every other graph whose balls of radius R are isometric to the balls of radius R in \mathcal{G} is covered by \mathcal{G}. An example of such a graph is given by the Bruhat-Tits building of PSL_n(\mathbb{Q}_p) with n\geq 4. In this paper we extend this rigidity property to a class of graphs quasi-isometric to the building including torsion-free lattices of SL_n(\mathbb{Q}_p). The demonstration is the occasion to prove a result on the local structure of the building. We show that if we fix a PSL_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)-orbit in it, then a vertex is uniquely determined by the neighbouring vertices in this orbit.
