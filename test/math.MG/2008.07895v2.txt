A lattice polytope is "free" (or "empty") if its vertices are the only lattice points it contains. In the context of valuation theory, Klain (1999) proposed to study the functions \alpha_i(P;n) that count the number of free polytopes in nP with i vertices. For i=1, this is the famous Ehrhart polynomial. For i > 3, the computation is likely impossible and for i=2,3 computationally challenging.   In this paper, we develop a theory of coprime Ehrhart functions, that count lattice points with relatively prime coordinates, and use it to compute \alpha_2(P;n) for unimodular simplices. We show that the coprime Ehrhart function can be explicitly determined from the Ehrhart polynomial and we give some applications to combinatorial counting.
