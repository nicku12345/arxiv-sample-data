Let S be a set of arbitrary objects, and let s\mapsto s' be a permutation of S such that s''=(s')'=s and s'\neq s. Let S^d=\{v_1...v_d\colon v_i\in S\}. Two words v,w\in S^d are dichotomous if v_i=w'_i for some i\in [d], and they form a twin pair if v_i'=w_i and v_j=w_j for every j\in [d]\setminus \{i\}. A polybox code is a set V\subset S^d in which every two words are dichotomous. A polybox code V is a cube tiling code if |V|=2^d. A 2-periodic cube tiling of \mathbb{R}^d and a cube tiling of flat torus \mathbb{T}^d can be encoded in a form of a cube tiling code. A twin pair v,w in which v_i=w_i' is glue (at the ith position) if the pair v,w is replaced by one word u such that u_j=v_j=w_j for every j\in [d]\setminus \{i\} and u_i=*, where *\not\in S is some extra fixed symbol. A word u with u_i=* is cut (at the ith position) if u is replaced by a twin pair q,t such that q_i=t_i' and u_j=q_j=t_j for every j\in [d]\setminus \{i\}. If V,W\subset S^d are two cube tiling codes and there is a sequence of twin pairs which can be interchangeably gluing and cutting in a way which allows us to pass from V to W, then we say that W is obtained from V by gluing and cutting. In the paper it is shown that for every two cube tiling codes in dimension six one can be obtained from the other by gluing and cutting.
