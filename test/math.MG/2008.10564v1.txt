The intermediate dimensions are a family of dimensions introduced in 2019 by Falconer, Fraser, and Kempton [arXiv:1811.06493] to interpolate between the Hausdorff dimension and the box dimension. To date, there are limited examples of explicit calculations of the intermediate dimensions of interesting sets. We calculate the intermediate dimensions of sets of concentric spheres converging to the origin in Euclidean spaces. We also consider related sets including isolated points on concentric spheres and attenuated topologist's sine curves.
