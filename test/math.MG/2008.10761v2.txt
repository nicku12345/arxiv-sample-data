We compute the asymptotic behavior of the average-case filling volume for certain models of random Lipschitz cycles in the unit cube and sphere. For example, we estimate the minimal area of a Seifert surface for a model of random knots first studied by Millett. This is a generalization of the classical Ajtai--Koml\'os--Tusn\'ady optimal matching theorem from combinatorial probability. The author hopes for applications to the topology of random links, random maps between spheres, and other models of random geometric objects.
