The Riesz s-energy of an N-point configuration in the Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^{p} is defined as the sum of reciprocal s-powers of all mutual distances in this system. In the limit s\to0 the Riesz s-potential 1/r^s (r the Euclidean distance) governing the point interaction is replaced with the logarithmic potential \log(1/r). In particular, we present a conjecture for the leading term of the asymptotic expansion of the optimal \IL_2-discrepancy with respect to spherical caps on the unit sphere in \mathbb{R}^{d+1} which follows from Stolarsky's invariance principle [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 41 (1973)] and the fundamental conjecture for the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion of the optimal Riesz s-energy of N points as N \to \infty.
