In "Octonion Algebra and its Connection to Physics" [16] an algorithm on octonions is brought forward for description of physical law, the "octonion variance sieve process". This paper expresses the used algorithm in symbolic form, and highlights the structure between the "function", "distance", and "algebraic invariant" concepts therein. An alternative description in terms of derivation algebras is shown.
