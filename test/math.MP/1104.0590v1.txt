We consider the resolution of the N=2 supersymmetric KdV equation with a=-2 (SKdV_{a=-2}) from two approaches, the group invariant method (or symmetry reduction) and the Hirota formalism. A bilinear form of the SKdV_{a=-2} equation is constructed. Links between the two methods are established and new solutions are obtained from both approaches.
