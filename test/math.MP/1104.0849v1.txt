We introduce a class of PT-symmetric systems which include mutually matched nonlinear loss and gain (inother words, a class of PT-invariant Hamiltonians in which both the harmonic and anharmonic parts are non-Hermitian). For a basic system in the form of a dimer, symmetric and asymmetric eigenstates, including multistable ones, are found analytically. We demonstrate that, if coupled to a linear chain, such a nonlinear PT-symmetric dimer generates new types of nonlinear resonances, with the completely suppressed or greatly amplified transmission, as well as a regime similar to the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). The implementation of the systems is possible in various media admitting controllable linear and nonlinear amplification of waves.
