For each simple euclidean Jordan algebra V of rank \rho and degree \delta, we introduce a family of classical dynamic problems. These dynamical problems all share the characteristic features of the Kepler problem for planetary motions, such as existence of Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector and hidden symmetry. After suitable quantizations, a family of quantum dynamic problems, parametrized by the nontrivial Wallach parameter \nu, is obtained. Here, \nu\in{\mathcal W}(V):=\{k {\delta\over 2}\mid k=1, ..., (\rho-1)\}\cup((\rho-1){\delta\over 2}, \infty) and was introduced by N. Wallach to parametrize the set of nontrivial scalar-type unitary lowest weight representations of the conformal group of V.   For the quantum dynamic problem labelled by \nu, the bound state spectra is -{1/2\over (I+\nu{\rho\over 2})^2}, I=0, 1, ... and its Hilbert space of bound states gives a new realization for the afore-mentioned representation labelled by \nu. A few results in the literature about these representations become more explicit and more refined.   The Lagrangian for a classical Kepler-type dynamic problem introduced here is still of the simple form: {1\over 2} ||\dot x||^2+{1\over r}. Here, \dot x is the velocity of a unit-mass particle moving on the space consisting of V's semi-positive elements of a fixed rank, and r is the inner product of x with the identity element of V.
