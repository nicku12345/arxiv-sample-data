We study the influence of disorder on propagation of waves in one-dimensional structures. Transmission properties of the process governed by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the white noise potential can be expressed through the Lyapunov exponent \gamma which we determine explicitly as a function of the noise intensity \sigma and the frequency \omega. We find uniform two-parameter asymptotic expressions for \gamma which allow us to evaluate \gamma for different relations between \sigma and \omega. The value of the Lyapunov exponent is also obtained in the case of a short-range correlated noise, which is shown to be less than its white noise counterpart.
