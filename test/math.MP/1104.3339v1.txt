The present work is devoted to the simulation of a strongly magnetized plasma considered as a mixture of an ion fluid and an electron fluid. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the model is isothermal and described by Euler equations coupled with a term representing the Lorentz force. Moreover we assume that both Euler systems are coupled through a quasi-neutrality constraint. The numerical method which is described in the present document is based on an Asymptotic-Preserving semi-discretization in time of a variant of this two-fluid Euler-Lorentz model with a small perturbation of the quasi-neutrality constraint. Firstly, we present the two-fluid model and the motivations for introducing a small perturbation into the quasi-neutrality equation, then we describe the time semi-discretization of the perturbed model and a fully-discrete finite volume scheme based on it. Finally, we present some numerical results which have been obtained with this method.
