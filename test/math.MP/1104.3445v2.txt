We consider the symmetric simple exclusion process in the interval [-N,N] with additional birth and death processes respectively on (N-K,N], K>0, and [-N,-N+K). The exclusion is speeded up by a factor N^2, births and deaths by a factor N. Assuming propagation of chaos (a property proved in a companion paper "Truncated correlations in the stirring process with births and deaths") we prove convergence in the limit N\to \infty to the linear heat equation with Dirichlet condition on the boundaries; the boundary conditions however are not known a priori, they are obtained by solving a non linear equation. The model simulates mass transport with current reservoirs at the boundaries and the Fourier law is proved to hold.
