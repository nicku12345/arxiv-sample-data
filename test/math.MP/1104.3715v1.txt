The pseudospherical functions on one-sheet, two-dimensional hyperboloid are discussed. The simplest method of construction of these functions is introduced using the Fock space structure of the representation space of the su(1,1) algebra. The pseudospherical functions with half-integer order are investigated. The counterparts of the Legendre functions for the hyperboloid are introduced and a new class of pseudospherical functions is found.
