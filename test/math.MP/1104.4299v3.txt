We study two versions of quasicrystal model, both subcases of Jacobi matrices. For Off-diagonal model, we show an upper bound of dynamical exponent and the norm of the transfer matrix. We apply this result to the Off-diagonal Fibonacci Hamiltonian and obtain a sub-ballistic bound for coupling large enough. In diagonal case, we improve previous lower bounds on the fractal box-counting dimension of the spectrum.
