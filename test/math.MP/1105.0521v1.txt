We consider a large neutral molecule with total nuclear charge Z in non-relativistic quantum mechanics with a self-generated classical electromagnetic field. To ensure stability, we assume that Z\al^2\le \kappa_0 for a sufficiently small \kappa_0, where \al denotes the fine structure constant. We show that, in the simultaneous limit Z\to\infty, \al\to 0 such that \kappa =Z\al^2 is fixed, the ground state energy of the system is given by a two term expansion c_1Z^{7/3} + c_2(\kappa) Z^2 + o(Z^2). The leading term is given by the non-magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory. Our result shows that the magnetic field affects only the second (so-called Scott) term in the expansion.
