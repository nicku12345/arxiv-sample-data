We investigate the enlarged class of open finite strings in (2+1)D space-time. The new dynamical system related to this class is constructed and quantized here. As the result, the energy spectrum of the model is defined by a simple formula {\sf S} = \alpha_n{\sf E} + c_n; the spin {\sf S} is an arbitrary number here but the constants \alpha_n and c_n are eigenvalues for certain spectral problems in fermionic Fock space {\bf H}_\psi constructed for the free 2D fermionic field.
