Numerical global optimization methods are often very time consuming and could not be applied for high-dimensional nonconvex/nonsmooth optimization problems. Due to the nonconvexity/nonsmoothness, directly solving the primal problems sometimes is very difficult. This paper presents a very simple but very effective canonical duality theory (CDT) unified global optimization algorithm. This algorithm has convergence is proved in this paper. More important, for this CDT-unified algorithm, numerous numerical computational results show that it is very powerful not only for solving low-dimensional but also for solving high-dimensional nonconvex/nonsmooth optimization problems, and the global optimal solutions can be easily and elegantly got with zero dual gap.
