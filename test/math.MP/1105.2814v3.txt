This paper is concerned with d=2 dimensional lattice field models with action V(\na\phi(\cdot)), where V:\R^d\ra \R is a uniformly convex function. The fluctuations of the variable \phi(0)-\phi(x) are studied for large |x| via the generating function given by g(x,\mu) = \ln <e^{\mu(\phi(0) - \phi(x))}>_{A}. In two dimensions g"(x,\mu)=\pa^2g(x,\mu)/\pa\mu^2 is proportional to \ln|x|. The main result of this paper is a bound on g"'(x,\mu)=\pa^3 g(x,\mu)/\pa \mu^3 which is uniform in |x| for a class of convex V.   The proof uses integration by parts following Helffer-Sj\"{o}strand and Witten, and relies on estimates of singular integral operators on weighted Hilbert spaces.
