The different orthogonal relationships that exists in the Lowdin orthogonalizations is presented. Other orthogonalization techniques such as polar decomposition (PD), principal component analysis (PCA) and reduced singular value decomposition (SVD) can be derived from Lowdin methods. It is analytically shown that the polar decomposition is presented in the symmetric orthogonalization; principal component analysis and singular value decomposition are in the canonical orthogonalization. The canonical orthogonalization can be brought in into the form of reduced SVD or vice-versa. The analytic relation between symmetric and canonical orthogonalization methods is established. The inter-relationship between symmetric orthogonalization and singular value decomposition is presented.
