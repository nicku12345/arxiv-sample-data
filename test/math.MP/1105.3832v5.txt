In the paper a new class of exact localized solutions of Dirac's equation in the field of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave and a constant magnetic field is presented. These solutions possess unusual properties and are applicable only to relativistic fermions. The problem of the magnetic resonance is considered in the framework of the classical theory of fields. It is shown that interpretation of the magnetic resonance for relativistic fermions must be changed. Numerical examples of parameters of the electromagnetic wave, constant magnetic field and the localization length scale for real measurements are presented.
