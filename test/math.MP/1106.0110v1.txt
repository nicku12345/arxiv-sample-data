In a series of recent papers the author has introduced the notion of (regular) pseudo-bosons showing, in particular, that two number-like operators, whose spectra are {\Bbb N}_0:={\Bbb N}\cup\{0\}, can be naturally introduced. Here we extend this construction to operators with rather more general spectra. Of course, this generalization can be applied to many more physical systems. We discuss several examples of our framework.
