Local fractional derivative and integrals are revealed as one of useful tools to deal with everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable functions in fractal areas ranging from fundamental science to engineering. In this paper, a generalized Newton iteration method derived from the generalized local fractional Taylor series with the local fractional derivatives is reviewed. Operators on real line numbers on a fractal space are induced from Cantor set to fractional set. Existence for a generalized fixed point on generalized metric spaces may take place.
