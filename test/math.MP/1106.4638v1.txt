It is known that a self-adjoint, time-independent hamiltonian can be defined for the quantum damped harmonic oscillator. We show here that the two vacua naturally associated to this operator, when expressed in terms of pseudo-bosonic lowering and raising operators, appear to be non square-integrable. This fact is interpreted as the evidence of the dissipation effect of the classical oscillator at a purely quantum level.
