The general features and characteristics of Kapteyn series, which are a special type of series involving Bessel function, are investigated. For many applications to physics, astrophysics, and mathematics, it is crucial to have closed-form expressions in order to determine their functional structure and parametric behavior. Closed-form expressions of Kapteyn series have mostly been limited to special cases, even though there are often similarities in the approaches used to reduce the series to analytically tractable forms. The goal of this paper is to review the previous work in the area and to show that Kapteyn series can be expressed as trigonometric or gamma function series, which can be evaluated in closed form for specific parameters. Two examples with a similar structure are given, showing the complexity of Kapteyn series.
