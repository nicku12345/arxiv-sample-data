For a general Fuchsian group of the first kind with an arbitrary unitary representation we define zeta functions related to the contributions of the identity, hyperbolic, elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes in Selberg's trace formula. We present Selberg's zeta function in terms of a regularized determinant of the automorphic Laplacian. We also present the zeta function for the identity contribution in terms of a regularized determinant of the Laplacian on the two dimensional sphere. We express the zeta functions for the elliptic and parabolic contributions in terms of certain regularized determinants of one dimensional Schroedinger operator for harmonic oscillator. We decompose the determinant of the automorphic Laplacian into a product of the determinants where each factor is a determinant representation of a zeta function related to Selberg's trace formula. Then we derive an identity connecting the determinants of the automorphic Laplacians on different Riemannian surfaces related to the arithmetical groups. Finally, by using the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence we connect the determinant of the automorphic Laplacian for the unit group of quaternions to the product of the determinants of the automorphic Laplacians for certain cogruence subgroups.
