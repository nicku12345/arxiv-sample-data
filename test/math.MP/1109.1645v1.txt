We consider Schr\"odinger equations for the quantum Painlev\'e equations. We present hypergeometric solutions of the Schr\"odinger equations for the quantum Painlev\'e equations, as particular solutions. We also give a representation theoretic correspondence between Hamiltonians of the Schr\"odinger equations for the quantum Painlev\'e equations and those of the KZ equation or the confluent KZ equations.
