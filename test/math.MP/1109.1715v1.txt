Tensor 50-component form of the first order relativistic wave equation for a particle with spin 2 and anomalous magnetic moment is extended to the case of an arbitrary curved space-time geometry. An additional parameter considered in the presence of only electromagnetic field as related to anomalous magnetic moment, turns to determine additional interaction terms with external geometrical background through Ricci R_{kl} and Riemann R_{klmn} tensors.
