The general concept of nonlinear self-adjointness of differential equations is introduced. It includes the linear self-adjointness as a particular case. Moreover, it embraces the previous notions of self-adjoint and quasi self-adjoint nonlinear equations. The class of nonlinearly self-adjoint equations includes, in particular, all linear equations. Conservation laws associated with symmetries can be constructed for all nonlinearly self-adjoint differential equations and systems. The number of equations in systems can be different from the number of dependent variables.
