The purpose is to study systems of interacting particles in the Generl Relativity context, by the principle of least action using purely classical concepts. The particles are described by a state tensor using a Clifford algebra for the kinematic part. The force fields, including gravitation, are described by connections on principle bundles. A solution has been found to account for individual particles. A more specific model based on scalar products, Dirac operator and chirality is studied in more details. Problems related to symmetries, including the Higgs mechanism, are intoduced. With a comprehensive coverage of topics it can be a useful pedagogical study.
