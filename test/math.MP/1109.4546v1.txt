There is proposed a model of scale-free random graphs which are locally close to the uncorrelated complex random networks with divergent \langle k^2 \rangle studied in e.g. S. N. Dorogovtsev {\it et al}, Rev. Mod. Phys. {\bf 80}, 1275 (2008). It is shown that the Ising model on these graphs with interaction intensities of arbitrary signs with probability one is in a paramagnetic state at sufficiently high finite values of the temperature. For the same graphs, the bond percolation model with probability one is in a nonpercolative state for positive values of the percolation probability. Possible extensions are discussed.
