A new method based on the phenomenon of synchronization and the properties of chaos is proposed to reduce interference in the transferred chaotic signals of synchronized systems. In this paper, the interference is considered as a series of small deviations from the original clean trajectory in the phase space. By means of our special design, these small deviations can be estimated using positive Lyapunov exponents, and removed from interfered chaotic signals. Application is illustrated for the Lorenz attractor, and numerical computing demonstrates that the method is effective in removing typical external interference.
