The exponential family of models is defined in a general setting, not relying on probability theory. Some results of information geometry are shown to remain valid. Exponential families both of classical and of quantum mechanical statistical physics fit into the new formalism. Other less obvious applications are predicted. For instance, quantum states can be modeled as points in a classical phase space and the resulting model belongs to the exponential family.
