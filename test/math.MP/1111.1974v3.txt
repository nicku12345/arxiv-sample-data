The Morse potential one-dimensional quantum system is a realistic model for studying vibrations of atoms in a diatomic molecule. This system is very close to the harmonic oscillator one. We thus propose a construction of squeezed coherent states similar to the one of harmonic oscillator using ladder operators. Properties of these states are analysed with respect to the localization in position, minimal Heisenberg uncertainty relation, the statistical properties and illustrated with examples using the finite number of states in a well-known diatomic molecule.
