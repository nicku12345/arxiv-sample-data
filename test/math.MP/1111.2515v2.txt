The phase coexistence is illuminated with geometric views of the thermodynamic variables, according to Gibbs' choices. Quantities and relations between them are obtained. The existence of the edge of regression with tangents coincident with the straight lines connecting the coexistence points of phase equilibrium is stressed. A geometric approach to the critical point leads to estimation of the values of the critical exponents for the angles formed by the coexistence curve and the straight lines with the principal direction along the minimal curvature.
