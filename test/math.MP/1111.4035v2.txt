We present sixteen-component values "sedeons", generating associative noncommutative space-time algebra. The generalized second-order and first-order equations of relativistic quantum mechanics based on sedeonic wave function and sedeonic space-time operators are proposed. We also discuss the description of fields with massive quantum on the basis of second-order and first-order equations for sedeonic potentials.
