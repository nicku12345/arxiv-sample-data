We consider a two-dimensional massless Dirac operator H in the presence of a perturbed homogeneous magnetic field B=B_0+b and a scalar electric potential V. For V\in L_{\rm loc}^p(\R^2), p\in(2,\infty], and b\in L_{\rm loc}^q(\R^2), q\in(1,\infty], both decaying at infinity, we show that states in the discrete spectrum of H are superexponentially localized. We establish the existence of such states between the zeroth and the first Landau level assuming that V=0. In addition, under the condition that b is rotationally symmetric and that V satisfies certain analyticity condition on the angular variable, we show that states belonging to the discrete spectrum of H are Gaussian-like localized.
