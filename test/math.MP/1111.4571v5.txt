We define different notions of black holes, event horizons and Killing horizons for a general time-oriented manifold (M,g) extending previous notions but without the assumption of asymptotical flatness. The notions of 'horizon' are always conformally invariant while the notions of 'black hole' are genuinely geometric. Some connections between the different notions are found. Finally, we put the definitions into the context of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.
