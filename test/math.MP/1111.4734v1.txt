In this work, the analytical solution of the hyper-radial Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the spherical Woods-Saxon potential in D dimensions is presented. In our calculations, we have applied the Nikiforov-Uvarov method by using the Pekeris approximation to the centrifugal potential for arbitrary l states. The bound state energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained for various values of n and l quantum numbers.
