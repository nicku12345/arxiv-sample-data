To our knowledge there are no complete results expressed in terms of eigenfunctions (even not strictly proved mathematically) related to the system of three or more charged quantum particles. For the system of the three such identical particles we suggest the asymptotic formula describing the behavior of eigenfunctions at infinity in configuration space.
