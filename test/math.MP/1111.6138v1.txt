Coupled discrete models abound in several areas of physics. Here we provide an extensive set of exact quasiperiodic solutions of a number of coupled discrete models in terms of Lam\'e polynomials of arbitrary order. The models discussed are (i) coupled Salerno model, (ii) coupled Ablowitz-Ladik model, (iii) coupled \phi^4 model, and (iv) coupled \phi^6 model. In all these cases we show that the coefficients of the Lam\'e polynomials are such that the Lam\'e polynomials can be reexpressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the relevant Jacobi elliptic function.
