We study the thermal properties of a pinned disordered harmonic chain weakly perturbed by a noise and an anharmonic potential. The noise is controlled by a parameter \lambda \rightarrow 0, and the anharmonicity by a parameter \lambda' \le \lambda. Let \kappa be the conductivity of the chain, defined through the Green-Kubo formula. Under suitable hypotheses, we show that \kappa = \mathcal O (\lambda) and, in the absence of anharmonic potential, that \kappa \sim \lambda. This is in sharp contrast with the ordered chain for which \kappa \sim 1/\lambda, and so shows the persitence of localization effects for a non-integrable dynamics.
