We study bound states of a 3--particle system in \mathbb{R}^3 described by the Hamiltonian H(\lambda_n) = H_0 + v_{12} + \lambda_n (v_{13} + v_{23}), where the particle pair \{1,2\} has a zero energy resonance and no bound states, while other particle pairs have neither bound states nor zero energy resonances. It is assumed that for a converging sequence of coupling constants \lambda_n \to \lambda_{cr} the Hamiltonian H(\lambda_n) has a sequence of levels with negative energies E_n and wave functions \psi_n, where the sequence \psi_n totally spreads in the sense that \lim_{n \to \infty}\int_{|\zeta| \leq R} |\psi_n (\zeta)|^2 d\zeta = 0 for all R>0. We prove that for large n the angular probability distribution of three particles determined by \psi_n approaches the universal analytical expression, which does not depend on pair--interactions. The result has applications in Efimov physics and in the physics of halo nuclei.
