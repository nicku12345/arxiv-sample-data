Based on the works of Gordon ([4]) and Zhang-Zhou([8])) on the variational minimizing properties for Keplerian orbits and Lagrangian solutions of Newtonian 2-body and 3-body problems, we use the constrained variational principle of Ambrosetti-Coti Zelati ([1]) to compute the Lagrangian actions on Keplerian and Lagrangian elliptical solutions with fixed energies, we also find an interesting relationship between period and energy for Lagrangian elliptical solutions with Newtonian potentials.
