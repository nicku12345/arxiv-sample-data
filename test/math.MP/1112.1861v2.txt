A consolidated mathematical formulation of the spherically symmetric mass-transfer problem is presented, with the quasi-stationary approximating equations derived from a perturbation point of view for the leading-order effect. For the diffusion-controlled quasi-stationary process, a mathematically complete set of the exact analytical solutions is obtained in implicit forms to cover the entire parameter range. Furthermore, accurate explicit formulas for the particle radius as a function of time are also constructed semi-empirically for convenience in engineering practice. Both dissolution of a particle in a solvent and growth of it by precipitation in a supersaturated environment are considered in the present work.
