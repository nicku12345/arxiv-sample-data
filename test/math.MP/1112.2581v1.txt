We consider the Hartree-Fock approximation of Quantum Electrodynamics, with the exchange term neglected. We prove that the probability of static electron-positron pair creation for the Dirac vacuum polarized by an external field of strength Z behaves as 1-\exp(-\kappa Z^{2/3}) for Z large enough. Our method involves two steps. First we estimate the vacuum expectation of general quasi-free states in terms of their total number of particles, which can be of general interest. Then we study the asymptotics of the Hartree-Fock energy when Z\to+\infty which gives the expected bounds.
