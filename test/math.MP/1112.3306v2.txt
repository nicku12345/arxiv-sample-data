In this paper we establish the existence of multi-vortices for a generalized self-dual Chern--Simons model. Doubly periodic vortices, topological and non-topological vortex solutions are constructed for this model. For the existence of doubly periodic vortex solutions, we establish an explicitly necessary and sufficient condition. It is difficult to get topological multi-vortex solutions due to the non-canonical structure of the equations. We overcome this difficulty by constructing a suitable sub-solution for the reduced equation. This technique maybe applied to the problems with similar structures. For the existence of non-topological solutions we use a shooting argument.
