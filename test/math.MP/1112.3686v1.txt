A construction of the heat kernel diagonal is considered as element of generalized Zeta function, that, being meromorfic function, its gradient at the origin defines determinant of a differential operator in a technique for regularizing quadratic path integral. Some classes of explicit expression in the case of finite-gap potential coefficient of the heat equation are constructed.
