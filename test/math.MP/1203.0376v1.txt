In this paper, we propose a globally hyperbolic regularization to the general Grad's moment system in multi-dimensional spaces. Systems with moments up to an arbitrary order are studied. The characteristic speeds of the regularized moment system can be analytically given and only depend on the macroscopic velocity and the temperature. The structure of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix is fully clarified. The regularization together with the properties of the resulting moment systems is consistent with the simple one-dimensional case discussed in [1]. Besides, all characteristic waves are proven to be genuinely nonlinear or linearly degenerate, and the studies on the properties of rarefaction waves, contact discontinuities and shock waves are included.
