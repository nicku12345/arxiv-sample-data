The behavior of an electron in an external uniform electromagnetic background coupled to a harmonic potential, with noncommuting space coordinates, is considered in this work. The thermodynamics of the system is studied. Matrix vector coherent states (MVCS) as well as quaternionic vector coherent states (QVCS), satisfying required properties, are also constructed and discussed.
