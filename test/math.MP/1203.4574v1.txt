4-dimensional F_{4}  polytopes and their dual polytopes have been constructed as the orbits of the Coxeter-Weyl group W(F_{4}) where the group elements and the vertices of the polytopes are represented by quaternions. Branchings of an arbitrary \textbf{W(F_{4})} orbit under the Coxeter groups W(B_{4}  and W(B_{3}) \times W(A_{1}) have been presented. The role of group theoretical technique and the use of quaternions have been emphasized
