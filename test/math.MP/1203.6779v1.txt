We study the D-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation for Eckart plus modified deformed Hylleraas potentials using the generalized parametric form of Nikiforov-Uvarov method. We obtain energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave function expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomial. We also discussed two special cases of this potential comprises of the Hulthen potential and the Rosen-Morse potential in 3-Dimensions. Numerical results are also computed for the energy spectrum and the potentials.
