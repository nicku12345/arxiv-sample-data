We present different methods for symbolic computer algebra computations in higher dimensional (\ge9) Clifford algebras using the \Clifford\ and \Bigebra\ packages for \Maple(R). This is achieved using graded tensor decompositions, periodicity theorems and matrix spinor representations over Clifford numbers. We show how to code the graded algebra isomorphisms and the main involutions, and we provide some benchmarks.
