This paper is devoted to the spectral theory of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator on the simplest fractal: Dyson's hierarchical lattice. An explicit description of the spectrum, eigenfunctions, resolvent and parabolic kernel are provided for the unperturbed operator, i.e., for the Dyson hierarchical Laplacian. Positive spectrum is studied for the perturbations of the hierarchical Laplacian. Since the spectral dimension of the operator under consideration can be an arbitrary positive number, the model allows a continuous phase transition from recurrent to transient underlying Markov process. This transition is also studied in the paper.
