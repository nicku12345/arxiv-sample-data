This paper tells the story how a MAPLE-assisted quest for an interesting undergraduate problem in trigonometric series led some "amateurs" to the discovery that the one-parameter family of deterministic trigonometric series \pzcS_p: t\mapsto \sum_{n\in\Nset}\sin(n^{-{p}}t), p>1, exhibits both order and apparent chaos, and how this has prompted some professionals to offer their expert insights. It is proved that \pzcS_p(t) = \alpha_p\rm{sign}(t)|t|^{1/{p}}+O(|t|^{1/{(p+1)}})\;\forall\;t\in\Rset, with explicitly computed constant \alpha_p. Experts' commentaries are reproduced stating the fluctuations of \pzcS_p(t) - \alpha_p{\rm{sign}}(t)|t|^{1/{p}} are presumably not Gaussian. Inspired by a central limit type theorem of Marc Kac, a well-motivated conjecture is formulated to the effect that the fluctuations of the \lceil t^{1/(p+1)}\rceil-th partial sum of \pzcS_p(t), when properly scaled, do converge in distribution to a standard Gaussian when t\to\infty, though --- provided that p is chosen so that the frequencies \{n^{-p}\}_{n\in\Nset} are rationally linear independent; no conjecture has been forthcoming for rationally dependent \{n^{-p}\}_{n\in\Nset}. Moreover, following other experts' tip-offs, the interesting relationship of the asymptotics of \pzcS_p(t) to properties of the Riemann \zeta function is exhibited using the Mellin transform.
