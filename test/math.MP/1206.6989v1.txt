There has been devoted significant mathematical research to model the light propagation in tissue and to recover the absorption and scattering coefficients after photoacoustic inversion. Typically, the basic light propagation models considered there are the diffusion limits of the radiative heat transfer model. These equations are well suited for models where the elastic scattering is the dominant effect. If, however, the scattering is less pronounced, a single scattering approximation model is practicable. As we show in this paper, this approach is practically relevant in focused/sectional photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, we study analytical reconstruction formulas for the single scattering case. To realise the single scattering approach, we propose concrete physical experiments based on photoacoustical sectional imaging.
