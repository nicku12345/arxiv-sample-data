Imaging of perfectly conducting crack(s) in a 2-D homogeneous medium using boundary data is studied. Based on the singular structure of the Multi-Static Response (MSR) matrix whose elements are normalized by an adequate test function at several frequencies, an imaging functional is introduced and analyzed. A non-iterative imaging procedure is proposed. Numerical experiments from noisy synthetic data show that acceptable images of single and multiple cracks are obtained.
