We introduce a variational principle for field theories, referred to as the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, and we show that the resulting field equations are the Euler-Lagrange equations in implicit form. Secondly, we introduce multi-Dirac structures as a graded analog of standard Dirac structures, and we show that the graph of a multisymplectic form determines a multi-Dirac structure. We then discuss the role of multi-Dirac structures in field theory by showing that the implicit Euler-Lagrange equations for fields obtained from the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle can be described intrinsically using multi-Dirac structures. Lastly, we show a number of illustrative examples, including time-dependent mechanics, nonlinear scalar fields, Maxwell's equations, and elastostatics.
