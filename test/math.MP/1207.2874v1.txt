In a recent series of papers we have analyzed a certain deformation of the canonical commutation relations producing an interesting functional structure which has been proved to have some connections with physics, and in particular with quasi-hermitian quantum mechanics. Here we repeat a similar analysis starting with the canonical anticommutation relations. We will show that in this case most of the assumptions needed in the former situation are automatically satisfied, making our construction rather {\em friendly}. We discuss some examples of our construction, again related to quasi-hermitian quantum mechanics, and the bi-coherent states for the system.
