We describe the geometric (Berry) phases arising when some quantum systems are driven by control classical parameters but also by outer classical stochastic processes (as for example classical noises). The total geometric phase is then divided into an usual geometric phase associated with the control parameters and a second geometric phase associated with the stochastic processes. The geometric structure in which these geometric phases take place is a composite bundle (and not an usual principal bundle), which is explicitely built in this paper. We explain why the composite bundle structure is the more natural framework to study this problem. Finally we treat a very simple example of a two level atom driven by a phase modulated laser field with a phase instability described by a gaussian white noise. In particular we compute the average geometric phase issued from the noise.
