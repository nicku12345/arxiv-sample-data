Starting from first principle many-body quantum dynamics, we show that the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates can be approximated by the time-dependent nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation, giving a bound on the rate of the convergence. Initial data are constructed on the bosonic Fock space applying an appropriate Bogoliubov transformation on a coherent state with expected number of particles N. The Bogoliubov transformation plays a crucial role; it produces the correct microscopic correlations among the particles. Our analysis shows that, on the level of the one particle reduced density, the form of the initial data is preserved by the many-body evolution, up to a small error which vanishes as N^{-1/2} in the limit of large N.
