We continue the investigations of Kirsch, Metzger and the second-named author [J. Stat. Phys. 143, 1035--1054 (2011)] on spectral properties of a certain type of random block operators. In particular, we establish an alternative version of a Wegner estimate and an improved result on Lifschitz tails at the internal band edges. Using these ingredients and the bootstrap multi-scale analysis, we also prove dynamical localization in a neighbourhood of the internal band edges.
