Recently, a non-iterative multi-frequency subspace migration imaging algorithm was developed based on an asymptotic expansion formula for thin, curve-like electromagnetic inclusions and the structure of singular vectors in the Multi-Static Response (MSR) matrix. The present study examines the structure of subspace migration imaging functional and proposes an improved imaging functional weighted by the frequency. We identify the relationship between the imaging functional and Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind. Numerical examples for single and multiple inclusions show that the presented algorithm not only retains the advantages of the traditional imaging functional but also improves the imaging performance.
