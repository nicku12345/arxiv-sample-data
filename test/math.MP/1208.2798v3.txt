Among finite solutions of Sine-Gordon Equation with in phase N=1, we find Modular and Landen transformation between \theta representation and directly integrated solutions of breather and kink. Because of these transformations, we can say we unified the finite solutions of sine-Gordon equation with phase N=1.
