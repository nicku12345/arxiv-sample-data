We study discrete quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators on \ell^2(\zee) with potentials defined by \gamma-H\"older functions. We prove a general statement that for \gamma >1/2 and under the condition of positive Lyapunov exponents, measure of the spectrum at irrational frequencies is the limit of measures of spectra of periodic approximants. An important ingredient in our analysis is a general result on uniformity of the upper Lyapunov exponent of strictly ergodic cocycles.
