The theory of singular dislocations is placed within the framework of the theory of continuous dislocations using de Rham currents. For a general n-dimensional manifold, an (n-1)-current describes a local layering structure and its boundary in the sense of currents represents the structure of the dislocations. Frank's rules for dislocations follow naturally from the nilpotency of the boundary operator.
