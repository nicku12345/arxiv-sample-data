A numerical method for an inverse problem for an elliptic equation with the running source at multiple positions is presented. This algorithm does not rely on a good first guess for the solution. The so-called "approximate global convergence" property of this method is shown here. The performance of the algorithm is verified on real data for Diffusion Optical Tomography. Direct applications are in near-infrared laser imaging technology for stroke detection in brains of small animals.
