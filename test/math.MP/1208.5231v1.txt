Distribution of mass velocity of quantum Bose-gas in half-space is received. Far from half-space border the gradient of mass velocity is set. The mass velocity of Bose-gas directly at a wall is found also. All results are received on basis of the analytical solution of Kramer's problem. The analysis of dependence of velocity coefficients from parametre quantity is carried out. The parametre representing the relation of chemical potential to product of Boltzmann constant on absolute temperature. Graphic comparison of coefficients of velocity Bose- and Fermi-gases is resulted.
