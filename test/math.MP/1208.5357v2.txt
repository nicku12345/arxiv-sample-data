In this paper, we consider zero range process with an initial condition which is equivalent to step initial condition in total asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) as described in a paper by R\'akos, A. and Sch\"utz by using techniques developed by Borodin, Ferrari, and Sasamoto. The solution for the transition probability of total asymmetric simple exclusion process for particles with different hopping rates was first worked out by Sch\"utz and Rak\"os (2005) for the case when p=1 or q=1. The formula was later applied to analyze two speed TASEP (Borodin, Ferrari, and Sasamoto, 2009) with alternating initial condition. Here we will investigate the two speed TASEP case with step initial condition.
