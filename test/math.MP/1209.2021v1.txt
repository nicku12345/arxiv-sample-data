The issue of general covariance of spinors and related objects is reconsidered. Given an oriented manifold M, to each spin structure \sigma and Riemannian metric g there is associated a space S_{\sigma, g} of spinor fields on M and a Hilbert space \HH_{\sigma, g}= L^2(S_{\sigma, g},\vol{M}{g}) of L^2-spinors of S_{\sigma, g}. The group \diff{M} of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of M acts both on g (by pullback) and on [\sigma] (by a suitably defined pullback f^*\sigma). Any f\in \diff{M} lifts in exactly two ways to a unitary operator U from \HH_{\sigma, g}  to \HH_{f^*\sigma,f^*g}. The canonically defined Dirac operator is shown to be equivariant with respect to the action of U, so in particular its spectrum is invariant under the diffeomorphisms.
