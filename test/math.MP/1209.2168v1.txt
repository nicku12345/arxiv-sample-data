In this paper we prove that the cone \PPD of positive, positive definite, discrete and strong almost periodic measures has an interesting property: given any positive and positive definite measure \mu smaller than some measure in \PPD, then the strong almost periodic part \mu_S of \mu is also in \PPD. We then use this result to prove that given a positive weighted comb \omega with finite local complexity and pure point diffraction, any positive comb less than \omega has either trivial Bragg spectrum or a relatively dense set of Bragg peaks.
