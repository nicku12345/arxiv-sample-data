We consider the asymptotic behavior of the second mixed moment of the characteristic polynomials of the 1D Gaussian band matrices, i.e. of the hermitian matrices H_n with independent Gaussian entries such that < H_{ij}H_{lk}>=\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}J_{ij}, where J=(-W^2\triangle+1)^{-1}. Assuming that W^2=n^{1+\theta}, 0<\theta<1, we show that this asymptotic behavior (as n\to\infty) in the bulk of the spectrum coincides with those for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble.
