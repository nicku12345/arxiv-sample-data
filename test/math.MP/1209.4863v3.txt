We prove a unique continuation principle for spectral projections of Schr\" odinger operators. We consider a Schr\" odinger operator H= -\Delta + V on \mathrm{L}^2(\mathbb{R}^d), and let H_{\Lambda} denote its restriction to a finite box \Lambda with either Dirichlet or periodic boundary condition. We prove unique continuation estimates of the type \chi_I (H_\Lambda) W \chi_I (H_\Lambda) \ge \kappa\, \chi_I (H_\Lambda)  with \kappa >0 for appropriate potentials W\ge 0 and intervals I. As an application, we obtain optimal Wegner estimates at all energies for a class of non-ergodic random Schr\" odinger operators with alloy{-type random potentials (`crooked' Anderson Hamiltonians). We also prove optimal Wegner estimates at the bottom of the spectrum with the expected dependence on the disorder (the Wegner estimate improves as the disorder increases), a new result even for the usual (ergodic) Anderson Hamiltonian. These estimates are applied to prove localization at high disorder for Anderson Hamiltonians in a fixed interval at the bottom of the spectrum.
