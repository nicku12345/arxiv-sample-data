The present paper is devoted to the study of resonances for one-dimensional quantum systems with a potential that is the restriction to some large box of an ergodic potential. For discrete models both on a half-line and on the whole line, we study the distributions of the resonances in the limit when the size of the box where the potential does not vanish goes to infinity. For periodic and random potentials, we analyze how the spectral theory of the limit operator influences the distribution of the resonances.
