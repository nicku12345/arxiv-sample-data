Author presents a study of certain category of the integrals, which might look quite difficult to compute, but in fact are easily computable, because they do not depend on the parameter in the integrand. As simple and elementary the procedure is, the author discovered that the best of symbolic manipulation packages presently available fail quite miserably, when asked to compute these integrals. The author suggests proper modifications in the algorithms used for symbolic integration.
