Using the statistical inference method, a non-relativistic, spinless, non-linear quantum dynamical equation is derived with the Fisher information metric substituted by the Jensen-Shannon distance information. Among all possible implications, it is shown that the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation preserves the symplectic structure of the complex Hilbert space, hence a Hamiltonian dynamics. The canonically projected dynamics is obtained on the corresponding projective Hilbert space of pure state density operators.
