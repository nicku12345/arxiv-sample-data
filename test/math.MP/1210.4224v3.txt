We study the level statistics of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with random potential decaying like x^{-\alpha} at infinity. We consider the point process \xi_L consisting of the rescaled eigenvalues and show that : (i)(ac spectrum case) for \alpha > \frac 12, \xi_L converges to a clock process, and the fluctuation of the eigenvalue spacing converges to Gaussian. (ii)(critical case) for \alpha = \frac 12, \xi_L converges to the limit of the circular \beta-ensemble.
