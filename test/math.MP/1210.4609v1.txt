Employing a limiting case of a conjecture for constructing piecewise separable-variables functions, the elements of the Pseudoanalytic Function Theory are used for numerically approaching solutions of the forward Dirichlet boundary value problem, corresponding to the Electrical Impedance Equation in the plane, when the electrical conductivity is an arbitrary non-vanishing function, fully defined within a bounded domain. The new method is studied considering a variety of examples when the bounded domain coincides with the unit circle, and it is also included a description of its behaviour in non-smooth domains, selecting special cases that do not require additional regularization techniques, for warranting the convergence of the approach at the non-smooth regions, when certain requirements are fulfilled.
