We consider a two-dimensional massless Dirac operator coupled to a magnetic field B and an electric potential V growing at infinity. We find a characterization of the spectrum of the resulting operator H in terms of the relation between B and V at infinity. In particular, we give a sharp condition for the discreteness of the spectrum of H beyond which we find dense pure point spectrum.
