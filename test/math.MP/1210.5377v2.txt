The analytical solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the Manning-Rosen potential plus a ring-shaped like potential is obtained by applying the Nikiforov-Uvarov method by using the improved approximation scheme to the centrifugal potential for arbitrary l states. The energy levels are worked out and the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of orthogonal polynomials for arbitrary l states.
