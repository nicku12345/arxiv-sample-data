The viscoelastic material functions for the Becker and the Lomnitz rheological models, sometimes employed to describe the transient flow of rocks, are studied and compared. Their creep functions, which are known in a closed form, share a similar time dependence and asymptotic behavior. This is also found for the relaxation functions, obtained by solving numerically a Volterra equation of the second kind. We show that the two rheologies constitute a clear example of broadly similar creep and relaxation patterns associated with neatly distinct retardation spectra, for which analytical expressions are available.
