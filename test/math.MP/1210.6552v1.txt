We consider the inverse scattering problem at fixed and sufficiently large energy for the nonrelativistic and relativistic Newton equation in \R^n, n \ge 2, with a smooth and short range electromagnetic field (V,B). Using results of [Firsov, 1953] or [Keller-Kay-Shmoys, 1956] we obtain a uniqueness result when B is assumed to be zero in a neighborhood of infinity and V is assumed to be spherically symmetric in a neighborhood of infinity.
