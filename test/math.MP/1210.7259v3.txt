This work addresses the study of the oscillator algebra, defined by four parameters p, q, \alpha, and \nu. The time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the induced deformed harmonic oscillator is solved; explicit analytic expressions of the energy spectrum are given. Deformed states are built and discussed with respect to the criteria of coherent state construction.   Various commutators involving annihilation and creation operators and their combinatorics are computed and analyzed. Finally, the correlation functions of matrix elements of main normal and antinormal forms, pertinent for quantum optics analysis, are computed.
