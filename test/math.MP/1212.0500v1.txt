What is a vector field on a C*-algebra is defined. Its relation to semigroups of endomorphisms was researched. Some results given about those vector fields and semigroups. There are also various constructions of semigroups including one parametrized by the cone of the future in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space. Physical interpretations will be presented in a separate paper.
