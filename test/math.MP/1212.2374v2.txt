Massless solutions for four coupled first order differential equations for functions representing families of spinors on the infinite disc curled into an almost S^2 are presented and normalizability conditions discussed. Spinors interact with two kinds of spin connection fields of particular coordinate dependence. This is the solution of equations of motion used in "Families of spinors in d=(1+5) with zweibein and two kinds of spin connection fields on an almost S^2".
