Previous results on the non trivial solution of the \Phi^4-equations of motion for the Green's functions in the Euclidean\ space (of 0\leq r\leq 4 dimensions) in the Wightman Quantum Field theory framework, are reviewed in the 0- dimensional case from the following two aspects: (cf.\cite{MM})\ The structure of the subset \Phi \subset {\cal B} characterized by the bounds signs and "splitting" (factorization properties) is reffined and more explictly described in terms of a new closed subset \Phi_0 \subset \Phi \subset {\cal B}.   Using a new norm we establish the local contractivity of the corresponding \Phi ^4_0 mapping in the neighborhood of a nontrivial sequence H_0\in \Phi_0. A new \Phi ^4_0 iteration is defined in the neighborhood of the sequence H_0\in \Phi_0 .   In this paper we present the results of our numerical study, so: {a)} \emph{the stability of \Phi_0} i.e. the splitting, bounds and sign properties is clearly illustrated in the neighborhood of H_0\in \Phi_0. {b)} the \emph{rapid convergence of this iteration} to the fixed point is perfectly realized thanks to the new starting points of the iteration.
