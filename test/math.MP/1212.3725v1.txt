We consider the polynomial algebra \mathbb{C}[\mathbf{z}]:=\mathbb{C}[z_1,\,z_2,\,z_3] and the polynomial f:=z_1^3+z_2^3+z_3^3+3qz_1z_2z_3, where q\in \mathbb{C}. Our aim is to compute the Hochschild homology and cohomology of the cubic surface \mathcal{X}_f:=\{\mathbf{z}\in\mathbb{C}^3\ /\ f(\mathbf{z})=0\}. For explicit computations, we shall make use of a method suggested by M. Kontsevich. Then, we shall develop it in order to determine the Hochschild homology and cohomology by means of multivariate division and Groebner bases. Some formal computations with Maple are also used.
