To model ferromagnetic material in finite element analysis a correct description of the constitutive relationship (BH-law) must be found from measured data. This article proposes to use the energy density function as a centrepiece. Using this function, which turns out to be a convex function of the flux density, guarantees energy conservative modelling. The magnetic field strength can be seen as a derivative with respect to the flux density. Especially for anisotropic materials (from lamination and/or grain orientation) this method has advantages. Strictly speaking this method is only valid for anhysteretic and thermodynamically stable material.
