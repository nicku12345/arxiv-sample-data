This paper deals with a polymeric matrix composite material. The matrix behaviour is described by the modified Rabotnov's nonlinear viscoelastic model assuming the material is nonlinear viscoelastic. The parameters of creep and stress-relaxation kernels of the model are determined. From the experimental data related to kernels approximated by spline functions and by means of the method of weighted residual, the formulas for the determination of viscoelastic parameters are derived.
