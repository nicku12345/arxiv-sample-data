We realize noncommutative phase spaces as coadjoint orbits of extensions of the Aristotle group in a two-dimensional space. Through these constructions the momenta of the phase spaces do not commute due to the presence of a naturally introduced magnetic field. These cases correspond to the minimal coupling of the momentum with a magnetic potential.
