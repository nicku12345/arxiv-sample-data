We consider generalized versions of the massless spin-boson model. Building on the recent work in 'Approach to ground state and time-independent photon bound for massless spin-boson models' (arXiv:1109.5582, Annales H. Poincare, 2012) and 'Propagation bounds and soft photon bounds for the massless spin-boson model' (submitted to arXiv jointly with the present paper), we prove asymptotic completeness.
