It is proved that smooth closed curves of given length minimizing the principal eigenvalue of the Schr\"odinger operator -\frac{d^2}{ds^2}+\kappa^2 exist. Here s denotes the arclength and \kappa the curvature. These minimizers are automatically planar, analytic, convex curves. The straight segment, traversed back and forth, is the only possible exception that becomes admissible in a more generalized setting. In proving this, we overcome the difficulty from a lack of coercivity and compactness by a combination of methods.
