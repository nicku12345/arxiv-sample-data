This paper addresses a new characterization of Sudarshan's diagonal representation of the density matrix elements \rho(z',z), derivedfrom (q;l,\lambda)-deformed boson coherent states.The induced \rho(z',z) self-reproducing property with the associated self-reproducing kernel K(z',z) is computed and analyzed. An explicit construction of novel classes of generalized continuous (q;l,\lambda)-Hermite polynomials is provided with the corresponding recursion relations and exact resolution of the moment problems giving their orthogonality weight functions. Besides, the Berezin-Klauder-Toeplitz quantization of classical phase space observables and relevant normal and anti-normal forms are investigated and discussed.
