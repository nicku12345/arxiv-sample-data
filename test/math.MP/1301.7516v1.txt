Transmission through and reflection from a potential barrier, and the very closely related issue of particle production from a parametric resonance, are topics of considerable general interest in quantum physics. We have developed a rather general bound on quantum transmission probabilities, and recently applied it to bounding the greybody factors of a Schwarzschild black hole. In this current paper, we take a different tack -- we report a way of using the Miller-Good transformation (which maps an initial Schrodinger equation to a final Schrodinger equation for a different potential) to significantly generalize the previous bound. We then apply this general formalism in a very specific manner to derive a rigorous bound that is "as close as possible" to the usual WKB estimate for barrier penetration.
