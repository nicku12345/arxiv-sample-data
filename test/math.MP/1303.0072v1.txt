Symmetry group of Lie algebras and superalgebras constructed from (\epsilon,\delta) Freudenthal- Kantor triple systems has been studied. Especially, for a special (\epsilon,\epsilon) Freudenthal- Kantor triple, it is SL(2) group. Also, relationship between two constructions of Lie algebras from structurable algebra has been investigated.
