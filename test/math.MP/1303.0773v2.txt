In this review, we investigate a key information-theoretic performance metric in multiple-antenna wireless communications, the so-called outage probability. This quantity may be expressed in terms of a moment generating function, for which we present two separate integral representations, one involving a particular \sigma-form of Painlev\'e V. We also present a representation involving a non-linear second order difference equation.
