It is shown that at least one particle is bound in the N-particle semi-relativistic Pauli-Fierz model with negative potential V(\bx). It is assumed that the particles have no spin and obey the Bose or Boltzmann statistics, and the one particle Hamiltonian \sqrt{-\Delta+M^2}-M+ V(\bx) has a ground state with negative energy -e_0<0, where M>0 denotes the mass of the particle. We show that the ground state energy of the total system E^V(N) is less than E^0(N)-e_0.
