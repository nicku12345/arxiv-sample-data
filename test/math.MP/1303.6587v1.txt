C.M. Bender and G. V. Dunne showed that linear combinations of words q^{k}p^{n}q^{n-k}, where p and q are subject to the relation qp - pq = \imath, may be expressed as a polynomial in the symbol z = \tfrac{1}{2}(qp+pq). Relations between such polynomials and linear combinations of the transformed coefficients are explored. In particular, examples yielding orthogonal polynomials are provided.
