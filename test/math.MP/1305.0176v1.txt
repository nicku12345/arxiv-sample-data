We consider the random Schrodinger operator on a strip of width W, assuming the site distribution of bounded density. It is shown that the positive Lyapounov exponents satisfy a lower bound roughly exponential in -W or W\to \infty. The argument proceeds directly by establishing Green's function decay, but does not appeal to Furstenberg's random matrix theory on the strip. One ingredient involved is the construction of `barriers' using the RSO theory on \mathbb Z.
