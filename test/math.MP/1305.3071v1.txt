The asymptotics of the weighted L_{p}-norms of Hermite polynomials, which describes the R\'enyi entropy of order p of the associated quantum oscillator probability density, is determined for n\to\infty and p>0. Then, it is applied to the calculation of the R\'enyi entropy of the quantum-mechanical probability density of the highly-excited (Rydberg) states of the isotropic oscillator.
