Continuous groups with antilinear operations of the form G+a_0G, where G denotes a linear Lie group, and a_0 is an antilinear operation which fulfills the condition a^2_0=\pm 1, were defined and their matrix algebras were investigated in \cite{Kocinski4}. In this paper infinitesimal-operator algebras are defined for any group of the form G+a_0G, and their properties are determined.
