The Halphen operator is a third-order operator of the form    L_3=\partial_x^3-g(g+2)\wp(x)\partial_x-\frac{1}{2}g(g+2)\wp'(x),  where g\ne 2\,\mbox{mod(3)}, the Weierstrass \wp-function satisfies the equation    (\wp'(x))^2=4\wp^3(x)-g_2\wp(x)-g_3.  In the equianharmonic case, i.e., g_2=0 the Halphen operator commutes with some ordinary differential operator L_n of order n\ne 0\,\mbox{mod(3)}. In this paper we find the spectral curve of the pair L_3,L_n.
