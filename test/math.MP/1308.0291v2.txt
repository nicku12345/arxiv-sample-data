In this paper we have generalized the quantum mechanics on fractal time-space. The time is changing on Cantor-set like but space is considered as fractal curve like Von-Koch curve. The Feynman path method in quantum mechanics has been suggested on fractal curve. Using F^{\alpha}-calculus and Feynman path method we found the Schr\"{e}dinger on fractal time-space. The Hamiltonian operator and momentum operator has been derived. More, the continuity equation and the probability density is given in generalized formulation.
