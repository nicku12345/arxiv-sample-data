After providing a general formulation of Fermion flows within the context of Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic calculus, we consider the problem of determining the noise coefficients of the Hamiltonian associated with a Fermion flow so as to minimize a naturally associated quadratic performance functional. This extends to Fermion flows results of the authors previously obtained for Boson flows .
