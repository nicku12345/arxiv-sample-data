In this article we introduce a new type of nonlocal operators and study the Cauchy problem for certain parabolic-type pseudodifferential equations naturally associated to these operators. Some of these equations are the p-adic master equations of certain models of complex systems introduced by Avetisov et al. The fundamental solutions of these parabolic-type equations are transition functions of random walks on the n-dimensional vector space over the field of p-adic numbers. We study some properties of these random walks, including the first passage time.
