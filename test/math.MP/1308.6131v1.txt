In the sub-Riemannian manifolds, on the one hand, following Baudoin-Garofalo \cite{BaudoinGarofalo}, the upper bound for heat kernels associated to a class of locally subelliptic operators are given under the generalized curvature-dimension inequality with a negative curvature parameter; on the other hand, the argument combining Grigor'yan's integrated maximum principle with Wang's dimension-free Harnack inequality is also shown to derive the upper bound for the heat kernel under the generalized curvature inequality.
