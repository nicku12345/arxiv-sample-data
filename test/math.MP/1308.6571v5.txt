A mathematically rigorous relativistic quantum Yang-Mills theory with an arbitrary semisimple compact gauge Lie group is set up in the Hamiltonian canonical formalism. The theory is non-perturbative, without cut-offs, and agrees with the causality and stability principles. This paper presents a fully revised, simplified, and corrected version of the corresponding material in the previous papers DYNIN[11] and [12]. The principal result is established anew: due to the quartic self-interaction term in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian along with the semisimplicity of the gauge group, the quantum Yang-Mills energy spectrum has a positive mass gap. Furthermore, the quantum Yang-Mills Hamiltonian has a countable orthogonal eigenbasis in a Fock space, so that the quantum Yang-Mills spectrum is point and countable. In addition a fine structure of the spectrum is elucidated.
