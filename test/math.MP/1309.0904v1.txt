Instead of a continuous system driven by Gaussian white noise, logical stochastic resonance will be investigated in a nonlinear bistable system with two thresholds driven by dichotomous noise, which shows a phenomenon different from Gaussian white noise. We can realize two parallel logical operations by simply adjusting the values of these two thresholds. Besides, to quantify the reliability of obtaining the correct logic output, we numerically calculate the success probability, and effects of dichotomous noise on the success probability are observed, these observations show that the reliability of realizing logical operation in the bistable system can be improved through optimizing parameters of dichotomous noise.
