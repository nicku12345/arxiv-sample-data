A supersymmetric extension of the Hahn algebra is introduced. This quadratic superalgebra, which we call the Hahn superalgebra, is constructed using the realization provided by the Dunkl oscillator model in the plane, whose Hamiltonian involves reflection operators. In this realization, the reflections act as grading operators and the odd generators are part of the Schwinger-Dunkl algebra, which is a two-parameter extension of the bosonic su(2) construction. The even part of the algebra is built from bilinears in the odd generators and satisfy the Hahn algebra supplemented with involutions. A family of supersymmetric Dunkl oscillator models in n dimensions is also considered. The Hamiltonians of these supersymmetric models differ from ordinary Dunkl oscillators by pure reflection terms. In two dimensions, the supersymmetric Dunkl oscillator is seen to have the even part of the Hahn superalgebra as invariance algebra.
