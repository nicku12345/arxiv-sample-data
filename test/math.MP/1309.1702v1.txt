We consider the time evolution of N bosons in the mean field regime for factorized initial data. In the limit of large N, the many body evolution can be approximated by the non-linear Hartree equation. In this paper we are interested in the fluctuations around the Hartree dynamics. We choose k self-adjoint one-particle operators O_1, \dots, O_k on L^2 (\R^3), and we average their action over the N-particles. We show that, for every fixed t \in \R, expectations of products of functions of the averaged observables approach, as N \to \infty, expectations with respect to a complex Gaussian measure, whose covariance matrix can be expressed in terms of a Bogoliubov transformation describing the dynamics of quantum fluctuations around the mean field Hartree evolution. If the operators O_1, \dots, O_k commute, the Gaussian measure is real and positive, and we recover a "classical" multivariate central limit theorem. All our results give explicit bounds on the rate of the convergence (we obtain therefore Berry-Ess{\'e}en type central limit theorems).
