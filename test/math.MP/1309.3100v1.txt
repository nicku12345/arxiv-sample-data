This work addresses a construction of a dual pair of nonlinear coherent states (NCS) in the context of changes of bases in the underlying Hilbert space for a model pertaining to the condensed matter physics, which obeys a f-deformed Heisenberg algebra. The existence and properties of reproducing kernel in the NCS Hilbert space are studied and discussed; the probability density and its dynamics in the basis of constructed coherent states are provided. A Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation of the density matrix and relevant issues related to the reproducing kernel properties are presented. Moreover, a NCS quantization of classical phase space observables is performed and illustrated in a concrete example of q-deformed coherent states. Finally, an exposition of quantum optical properties is given.
