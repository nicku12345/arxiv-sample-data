In a previous paper, a solution to the problem of determining isomorphism classes of Lie algebra representations was explored using graphs called adinkras and subgraphs called baobabs arXiv:1306.0550[math-ph] In this paper, I show that adinkras contain Shannon entropy and a latent heat from the information stored in their associated baobabs. In Garden algebra, both properties are closely related to the spectrum of hypercubes quotiented by doubly even codewords, which is introduced in this paper.
