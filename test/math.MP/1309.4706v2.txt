The behaviour of the spectral edges (embedded eigenvalues and resonances) is discussed at the two ends of the continuous spectrum of non-local discrete Schr\"odinger operators with a \delta-potential. These operators arise by replacing the discrete Laplacian by a strictly increasing C^1-function of the discrete Laplacian. The dependence of the results on this function and the lattice dimension are explicitly derived. It is found that while in the case of the discrete Schr\"odinger operator these behaviours are the same no matter which end of the continuous spectrum is considered, an asymmetry occurs for the non-local cases. A classification with respect to the spectral edge behaviour is also offered.
