We prove a general result on convergence of interfaces in the critical planar Ising model to conformally invariant curves absolutely continuous with respect to SLE(3). Our setup includes multiple interfaces on arbitrary finitely connected domains, and we also treat the radial SLE case. In the case of simply and doubly connected domains, the limiting processes are described explicitly in terms of rational and elliptic functions, respectively.
