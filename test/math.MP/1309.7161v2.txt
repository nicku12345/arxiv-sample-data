An exhaustive group classification of variable coefficient generalized Kawahara equations is carried out. As a result, we derive new variable coefficient nonlinear models admitting Lie symmetry extensions. All inequivalent Lie reductions of these equations to ordinary differential equations are performed. We also present some examples on the construction of exact and numerical solutions.
