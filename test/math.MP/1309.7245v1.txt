In a recent paper, Post and Winternitz studied the properties of two-dimensional Euclidean potentials that are linear in one of the two Cartesian variables. In particular, they proved the existence of a potential endowed with an integral of third-order and an integral of fourth-order. In this paper we show that these results can be obtained in a more simple and direct way by noting that this potential is directly related with the Holt potential. It is proved that the existence of a potential with higher order superintegrability is a direct consequence of the integrability of the family of Holt type potentials.
