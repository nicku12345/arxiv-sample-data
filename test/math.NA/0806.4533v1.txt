In recent contributions, algebraic multigrid methods have been designed and studied from the viewpoint of the spectral complementarity. In this note we focus our efforts on specific applications and, more precisely, on large linear systems arising from the approximation of weighted Laplacian with various boundary conditions. We adapt the multigrid idea to this specific setting and we present and critically discuss a wide numerical experimentation showing the potentiality of the considered approach.
