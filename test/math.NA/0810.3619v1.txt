We consider regularization methods of Kaczmarz type in connection with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for solving ill-posed equations. For noisy data, our methods are stabilized extensions of the well established ordered-subsets expectation-maximization iteration (OS-EM). We show monotonicity properties of the methods and present a numerical experiment which indicates that the extended OS-EM methods we propose are much faster than the standard EM algorithm.
