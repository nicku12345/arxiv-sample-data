The time integration of semilinear parabolic problems by exponential methods of different kinds is considered. A new algorithm for the implementation of these methods is proposed. The algorithm evaluates the operators required by the exponential methods by means of a quadrature formula that converges like O(e^{-cK/\ln K}), with K the number of quadrature nodes. The algorithm allows also the evaluation of the associated scalar mappings and in this case the quadrature converges like O(e^{-cK}). The technique is based on the numerical inversion of sectorial Laplace transforms. Several numerical illustrations are provided to test the algorithm.
