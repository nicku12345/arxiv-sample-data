We consider the computation of stable approximations to the exact solution x^\dag of nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems F(x)=y with nonlinear operators F:X\to Y between two Hilbert spaces X and Y by the Newton type methods  x_{k+1}^\delta=x_0-g_{\alpha_k} (F'(x_k^\delta)^*F'(x_k^\delta)) F'(x_k^\delta)^* (F(x_k^\delta)-y^\delta-F'(x_k^\delta)(x_k^\delta-x_0))  in the case that only available data is a noise y^\delta of y satisfying \|y^\delta-y\|\le \delta with a given small noise level \delta>0. We terminate the iteration by the discrepancy principle in which the stopping index k_\delta is determined as the first integer such that  \|F(x_{k_\delta}^\delta)-y^\delta\|\le \tau \delta <\|F(x_k^\delta)-y^\delta\|, \qquad 0\le k<k_\delta  with a given number \tau>1. Under certain conditions on \{\alpha_k\}, \{g_\alpha\} and F, we prove that x_{k_\delta}^\delta converges to x^\dag as \delta\to 0 and establish various order optimal convergence rate results. It is remarkable that we even can show the order optimality under merely the Lipschitz condition on the Fr\'{e}chet derivative F' of F if x_0-x^\dag is smooth enough.
