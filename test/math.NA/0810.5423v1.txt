In the paper properties of the discrete analogue D_m(h\beta) of the differential operator \frac{d^{2m}}{dx^{2m}}-\frac{d^{2m-2}}{dx^{2m-2}} are studied. It is known, that zeros of differential operator \frac{d^{2m}}{dx^{2m}}-\frac{d^{2m-2}}{dx^{2m-2}} are functions e^x, e^{-x} and P_{2m-3}(x). It is proved that discrete analogue D_m(h\beta) of this differential operator also have similar properties.
