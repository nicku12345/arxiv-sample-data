We consider sequences (B_k)_{k=0}^\infty of points obtained by projecting back and forth between two manifolds \M_1 and \M_2, and give conditions guaranteeing that the sequence converge to a limit B_\infty\in\M_1\cap\M_2. Our motivation is the study of algorithms based on finding the limit of such sequences, which have proven useful in a number of areas. The intersection is typically a set with desirable properties, but for which there is no efficient method of finding the closest point B_{opt} in \M_1\cap\M_2. We prove not only that the sequence of alternating projections converges, but that the limit point is fairly close to B_{opt}, in a manner relative to the distance \|B_0-B_{opt}\|, thereby significantly improving earlier results in the field. A concrete example with applications to frequency estimation of signals is also presented.
