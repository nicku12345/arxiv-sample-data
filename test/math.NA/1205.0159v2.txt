An integro-differential equation of hyperbolic type, with mixed boundary conditions, is considered. A continuous space-time finite element method of degree one is formulated. A posteriori error representations based on space-time cells is presented such that it can be used for adaptive strategies based on dual weighted residual methods. A posteriori error estimates based on weighted global projections and local projections are also proved.
