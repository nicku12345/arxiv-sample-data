Continuing the discussion of the multi-adaptive Galerkin methods mcG(q) and mdG(q) presented in [A. Logg, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 24 (2003), pp. 1879-1902], we present adaptive algorithms for global error control, iterative solution methods for the discrete equations, features of the implementation Tanganyika, and computational results for a variety of ODEs. Examples include the Lorenz system, the solar system, and a number of time-dependent PDEs.
