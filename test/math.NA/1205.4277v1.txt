We present a novel numerical method to the time-harmonic inverse medium scattering problem of recovering the refractive index from near-field scattered data. The approach consists of two stages, one pruning step of detecting the scatterer support, and one resolution enhancing step with mixed regularization. The first step is strictly direct and of sampling type, and faithfully detects the scatterer support. The second step is an innovative application of nonsmooth mixed regularization, and it accurately resolves the scatterer sizes as well as intensities. The model is efficiently solved by a semi-smooth Newton-type method. Numerical results for two- and three-dimensional examples indicate that the approach is accurate, computationally efficient, and robust with respect to data noise.
