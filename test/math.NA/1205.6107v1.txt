We derive an analytical expression for the solution of a two-dimensional quasicontinuum method with a planar interface. The expression is used to prove that the ghost force may lead to a finite size error for the gradient of the solution. We estimate the width of the interfacial layer induced by the ghost force is of \co(\sqrt{\eps}\,) with \eps the equilibrium bond length, which is much wider than that of the one-dimensional problem.
