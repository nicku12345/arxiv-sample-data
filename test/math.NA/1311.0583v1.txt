The 1980 IDR method plays an important role in the history of Krylov subspace methods. It started the research of transpose-free Krylov subspace methods. In this paper, we make a first attempt to bring back A-transpose to the research area by presenting a new ML(n)BiCGStab variant that involves A-transpose in its implementation. Comparisons of this new algorithm with the existing ML(n)BiCGStab algorithms will be presented.
