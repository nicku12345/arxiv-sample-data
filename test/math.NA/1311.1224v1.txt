Efficient time integration methods based on operator splitting are introduced for the Westervelt equation, a nonlinear damped wave equation that arises in nonlinear acoustics as mathematical model for the propagation of sound waves in high intensity ultrasound applications. For the first-order Lie-Trotter splitting method a global error estimate is deduced, confirming that the splitting method remains stable and that the nonstiff convergence order is retained in situations where the problem data are sufficiently regular. Fundamental ingredients in the stability and error analysis are regularity results for the Westervelt equation and related linear evolution equations of hyperbolic and parabolic type. Numerical examples illustrate and complement the theoretical investigations.
