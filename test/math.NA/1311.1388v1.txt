This paper focuses on the numerical solution of initial value problems for fractional differential equations of linear type. The approach we propose grounds on expressing the solution in terms of some integral weighted by a generalized Mittag-Leffler function. Then suitable quadrature rules are devised and order conditions of algebraic type are derived. Theoretical findings are validated by means of numerical experiments and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by means of comparisons with other standard methods.
