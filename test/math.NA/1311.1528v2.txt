We analyze univariate oscillatory integrals for the standard Sobolev spaces H^s of periodic and non-periodic functions with an arbitrary integer s\ge1. We find matching lower and upper bounds on the minimal worst case error of algorithms that use n function or derivative values. We also find sharp bounds on the information complexity which is the minimal n for which the absolute or normalized error is at most \varepsilon. We show surprising relations between the information complexity and the oscillatory weight. We also briefly consider the case of s=\infty.
