Sparsity promoting regularization is an important technique for signal reconstruction and several other ill-posed problems. Theoretical investigation typically bases on the assumption that the unknown solution has a sparse representation with respect to a fixed basis. We drop this sparsity assumption and provide error estimates for non-sparse solutions. After discussing a result in this direction published earlier by one of the authors and coauthors we prove a similar error estimate under weaker assumptions. Two examples illustrate that this set of weaker assumptions indeed covers additional situations which appear in applications.
