We consider the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation perturbed by smooth additive Gaussian noise in a spatial domain with smooth boundary in dimension d\le 3, and study the semidiscretization in time of the equation by an implicit Euler method. We show that the method converges pathwise with a rate O(\Delta t^{\gamma})  for any \gamma<\frac12. We also prove that the scheme converges uniformly in the strong L^p-sense but with no rate given.
