We consider the linear and non linear cubic Schr\"odinger equations with periodic boundary conditions, and their approximations by splitting methods. We prove that for a dense set of arbitrary small time steps, there exists numerical solutions leading to strong numerical instabilities preventing the energy conservation and regularity bounds obtained for the exact solution. We analyze rigorously these instabilities in the semi-discrete and fully discrete cases.
