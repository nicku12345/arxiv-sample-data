In this paper we investigate the numerical solution of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for a wider class of stochastic equations. We focus on non-diagonal colored noise instead of the usual space-time white noise. By applying a spectral Galerkin method for spatial discretization and a numerical scheme in time introduced by Jentzen \& Kloeden, we obtain the rate of path-wise convergence in the uniform topology. The main assumptions are either uniform bounds on the spectral Galerkin approximation or uniform bounds on the numerical data. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretically predicted convergence rate.
