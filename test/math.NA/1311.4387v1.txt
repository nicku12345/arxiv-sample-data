Normal multi-scale transform [4] is a nonlinear multi-scale transform for representing geometric objects that has been recently investigated [1, 7, 10]. The restrictive role of the exact order of polynomial reproduction P_e of the approximating subdivision operator S in the analysis of the S normal multi-scale transform, established in [7, Theorem 2.6], significantly disfavors the practical use of these transforms whenever P_e\ll P. We analyze in detail the normal multi-scale transform for planar curves based on B-spline subdivision scheme S_p of degree p\ge3 and derive higher smoothness of the normal re-parameterization than in [7]. We show that further improvements of the smoothness factor are possible, provided the approximate normals are cleverly chosen. Following [10], we introduce a more general framework for those transforms where more than one subdivision operator can be used in the prediction step, which leads to higher detail decay rates.
