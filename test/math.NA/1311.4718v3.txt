A new family of mixed finite elements is proposed for solving the classical Hellinger-Reissner mixed problem of the elasticity equations. For two dimensions, the normal stress of the matrix-valued stress field is approximated by an enriched Brezzi-Douglas-Fortin-Marini element of order k, and the shear stress by the serendipity element of order k, the displacement field by an enriched discontinuous vector-valued P_{k-1} element. The degrees of freedom on each element of the lowest order element, which is of first order, is 10 plus 4. For three dimensions, the normal stress is approximated by an enriched Raviart-Thomas element of order k, and each component of the shear stress by a product space of the serendipity element space of two variables and the space of polynomials of degree \leq k-1 with respect to the rest variable, the displacement field by an enriched discontinuous vector-valued Q_{k-1} element. The degrees of freedom on each element of the lowest order element, which is of first order, is 21 plus 6. A family of reduced elements is also proposed by dropping some interior bubble functions of the stress and employing the discontinuous vector-valued P_{k-1} (resp. Q_{k-1}) element for the displacement field on each element. As a result the lowest order elements have 8 plus 2 and 18 plus 3 degrees of freedom on each element for two and three dimensions, respectively.   The well-posedness condition and the optimal a priori error estimate are proved for this family of finite elements. Numerical tests are presented to confirm the theoretical results.
