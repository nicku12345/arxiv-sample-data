We consider the question of approximating the inverse \mathbf W = \mathbf V^{-1} of the Galerkin stiffness matrix \mathbf V obtained by discretizing the simple-layer operator V with piecewise constant functions. The block partitioning of \mathbf W is assumed to satisfy any of the standard admissibility criteria that are employed in connection with clustering algorithms to approximate the discrete BEM operator \mathbf V. We show that \mathbf W can be approximated by blockwise low-rank matrices such that the error decays exponentially in the block rank employed. Similar exponential approximability results are shown for the Cholesky factorization of \mathbf V.
