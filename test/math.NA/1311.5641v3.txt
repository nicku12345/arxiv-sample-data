Based on our recent results, in this paper, a compact finite difference scheme is derived for a time fractional differential equation subject to the Neumann boundary conditions. The proposed scheme is second order accurate in time and fourth order accurate in space. In addition, a high order alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme is also constructed for the two-dimensional case. Stability and convergence of the schemes are analyzed using their matrix forms.
