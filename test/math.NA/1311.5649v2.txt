In this work we analyze the stability and convergence properties of a loosely-coupled scheme, called the kinematically coupled scheme, for interaction between an incompressible viscous fluid and a thin structure. We consider a benchmark problem where the structure is modeled using the linearly elastic Koiter membrane model and the coupling between the fluid and structure is linear. We derive the energy estimates associated with the unconditional stability and, for the first time, present a priori estimates showing optimal, first-order in time, convergence. The theoretical stability and convergence results are supported with numerical examples.
