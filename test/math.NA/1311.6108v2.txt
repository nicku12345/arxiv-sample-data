This paper illuminates the derivation, the applicability, and the efficiency of the Multiplicative Runge-Kutta Method, derived in the frame- work of geometric multiplicative calculus. The removal of the restrictions of geometric multiplicative calculus to positive-valued functions of real variable and the fact that the multiplicative derivative does not exist at the roots of the function, is presented explicitly to ensure that the proposed method is uni- versally applicable. The error analysis is also carried out in the framework of geometric multiplicative calculus explicitly. The presented method is applied to various problems and the results are compared to the ones obtained from the Ordinary Runge-Kutta Method. Moreover, for one example, a comparison of the computation time vs. relative error, is worked out, to illustrate the general advantage of the proposed method.
