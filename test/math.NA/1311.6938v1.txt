In this paper, we study superconvergence properties of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for one-dimensional linear hyperbolic equation when upwind fluxes are used. We prove, for any polynomial degree k, the 2k+1th (or 2k+1/2th) superconvergence rate of the DG approximation at the downwind points and for the domain average under quasi-uniform meshes and some suitable initial discretization. Moreover, we prove that the derivative approximation of the DG solution is superconvergent with a rate k+1 at all interior left Radau points. All theoretical finding are confirmed by numerical experiments.
