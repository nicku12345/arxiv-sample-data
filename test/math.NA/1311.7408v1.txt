In this paper we study the best asymmetric (sometimes also called penalized or sign-sensitive) approximation in the metrics of the space L_p, 1\leqslant p\leqslant\infty, of functions f\in C^2\left([0,1]^2\right) with nonnegative Hessian by piecewise linear splines s\in S(\triangle_N), generated by given triangulations \triangle_N with N elements. We find the exact asymptotic behavior of optimal (over triangulations \triangle_N and splines s\in S(\triangle_N) error of such approximation as N\to \infty.
