In this paper we develop a family of preconditioners for the linear algebraic systems arising from the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian discretization of some fluid-structure interaction models. After the time discretization, we formulate the fluid-structure interaction equations as saddle point problems and prove the uniform well-posedness. Then we discretize the space dimension by finite element methods and prove their uniform well-posedness by two different approaches under appropriate assumptions. The uniform well-posedness makes it possible to design robust preconditioners for the discretized fluid-structure interaction systems. Numerical examples are presented to show the robustness and efficiency of these preconditioners.
