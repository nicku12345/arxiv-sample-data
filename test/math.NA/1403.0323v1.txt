Lanczos methods for solving \textit{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b} consist in constructing a sequence of vectors (\textbf{x}_k), k=1,... such that \textbf{r}_{k}=\textbf{b}-\textit{A}\textbf{x}_{k}=\textit{P}_{k}(\textit{A})\textbf{r}_{0},, where \textit{P}_{k} is the orthogonal polynomial of degree at most k with respect to the linear functional c defined as c(\xi^i)=(\textbf{y},\textit{A}^i\textbf{r}_{0}). Let \textit{P}^{(1)}_{k} be the regular monic polynomial of degree k belonging to the family of formal orthogonal polynomials (FOP) with respect to c^{(1)} defined as c^{(1)}(\xi^{i})=c(\xi^{i+1}). All Lanczos-type algorithms are characterized by the choice of one or two recurrence relationships, one for \textit{P}_{k} and one for \textit{P}^{(1)}_{k}. We shall study some new recurrence relations involving \textit{P}_{k} and \textit{P}^{(1)}_{k} and their possible combination to obtain new Lanczos-type algorithms. We will show that some recurrence relations exist, but cannot be used to derive Lanczos-type algorithms, while others do not exist at all.
