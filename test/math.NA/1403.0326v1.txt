Various recurrence relations between formal orthogonal polynomials can be used to derive Lanczos-type algorithms. In this paper, we consider recurrence relation A_{12} for the choice U_i(x)=P_i(x), where U_i is an auxiliary family of polynomials of exact degree i. It leads to a Lanczos-type algorithm that shows superior stability when compared to existing Lanczos-type algorithms. The new algorithm is derived and described. It is then computationally compared to the most robust algorithms of this type, namely A_{12}, A_5/B_{10} and A_8/B_{10}, on the same test problems. Numerical results are included.
