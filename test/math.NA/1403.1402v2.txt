We consider an arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian evolving surface finite element method for the numerical approximation of advection and diffusion of a conserved scalar quantity on a moving surface. We describe the method, prove optimal order error bounds and present numerical simulations that agree with the theoretical results.
