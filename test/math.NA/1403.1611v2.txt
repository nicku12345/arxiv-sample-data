We study the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete elastic energies in presence of the prestrain metric G, assigned on the continuum reference configuration \Omega. When the mesh size of the discrete lattice in \Omega goes to zero, we obtain the variational bounds on the limiting (in the sense of \Gamma-limit) energy. In case of the nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neibghour interactions, we derive a precise asymptotic formula, and compare it with the non-Euclidean model energy relative to G.
