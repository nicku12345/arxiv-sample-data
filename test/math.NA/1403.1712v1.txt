In this paper, the bending and free flexural vibration behaviour of sandwich plates with carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced facesheets are investigated using QUAD-8 shear flexible element developed based on higher-order structural theory. This theory accounts for the realistic variation of the displacements through the thickness, and the possible discontinuity in slope at the interface, and the thickness stretch affecting the transverse deflection. The in-plane and rotary inertia terms are considered in the formulation. The governing equations obtained using Lagrange's equation of motions are solved for static and dynamic analyses considering a sandwich plate with homogeneous core and CNT reinforced face sheets. The accuracy of the present formulation is tested considering the problems for which solutions are available. A detailed numerical study is carried out based on various higher-order models deduced from the present theory to examine the influence of the volume fraction of the CNT, core-to-face sheet thickness and the plate thickness ratio on the global/local response of different sandwich plates.
