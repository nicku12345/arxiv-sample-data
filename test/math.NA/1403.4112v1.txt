This paper is concerned with the construction of high order schemes on irregular grids for balance laws, including a discussion of an a-posteriori error indicator based on the numerical entropy production. We also impose well-balancing on non uniform grids for the shallow water equations, which can be extended similarly to other cases, obtaining schemes up to fourth order of accuracy with very weak assumptions on the regularity of the grid. Our results show the expected convergence rates, the correct propagation of shocks across grid discontinuities and demonstrate the improved resolution achieved with a locally refined non-uniform grid.   The error indicator based on the numerical entropy production, previously introduced for the case of systems of conservation laws, is extended to balance laws. Its decay rate and its ability to identify discontinuities is illustrated on several tests. The schemes proposed in this work naturally can also be applied to systems of conservation laws.
