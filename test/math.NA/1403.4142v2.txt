The computation of eigenvalues of large-scale matrices arising from finite element discretizations has gained significant interest in the last decade. Here we present a new algorithm based on slicing the spectrum that takes advantage of the rank structure of resolvent matrices in order to compute m eigenvalues of the generalized symmetric eigenvalue problem in \mathcal{O}(n m \log^\alpha n) operations, where \alpha>0 is a small constant.
