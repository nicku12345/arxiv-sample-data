We develop and analyze multilevel methods for nonuniformly elliptic operators whose ellipticity holds in a weighted Sobolev space with an A_2--Muckenhoupt weight. Using the so-called Xu-Zikatanov (XZ) identity, we derive a nearly uniform convergence result, under the assumption that the underlying mesh is quasi-uniform. We also consider the so-called \alpha-harmonic extension to localize fractional powers of elliptic operators. Motivated by the scheme proposed in [R.H. Nochetto, E. Otarola, and A.J. Salgado. A PDE approach to fractional diffusion in general domains: a priori error analysis. arXiv:1302.0698, 2013] we present a multilevel method with line smoothers and obtain a nearly uniform convergence result on anisotropic meshes. Numerical experiments reveal a competitive performance of our method.
