In this paper, to solve a broad class of complex symmetric linear systems, we recast the complex system in a real formulation and apply the generalized successive overrelaxation (GSOR) iterative method to the equivalent real system. We then investigate its convergence properties and determine its optimal iteration parameter as well as its corresponding optimal convergence factor. In addition, the resulting GSOR preconditioner is used to preconditioned Krylov subspace methods such as GMRES for solving the real equivalent formulation of the system. Finally, we give some numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results and compare the performance of the GSOR method with the modified Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting (MHSS) iteration.
