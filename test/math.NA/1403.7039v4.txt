We propose a framework for unified analysis of mixed methods for elasticity with weakly symmetric stress. Based on a commuting diagram in the weakly symmetric elasticity complex and extending a previous stability result, stable mixed methods are obtained by combining Stokes stable and elasticity stable finite elements. We show that the framework can be used to analyze most existing mixed methods for the elasticity problem with elementary techniques. We also show that some new stable mixed finite elements are obtained.
