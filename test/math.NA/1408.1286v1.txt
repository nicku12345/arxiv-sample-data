In this paper, a new method is proposed to prove the superconvergence of both the Crouzeix-Raviart and Morley elements. The main idea is to fully employ equivalences with the first order Raviart-Thomas element and the first order Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson element, respectively. In this way, some special conformity of discrete stresses is explored and superconvergence of mixed elements can be used to analyze superconvergence of nonconforming elements. Finally, a half order superconvergence by postprocessing is proved for both nonconforming elements.
