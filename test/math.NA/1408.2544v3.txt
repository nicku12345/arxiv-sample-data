A rigid body model for the dynamics of a marine vessel, used in simulations of offshore pipe-lay operations, gives rise to a set of ordinary differential equations with controls. The system is input-output passive. We propose passivity-preserving splitting methods for the numerical solution of a class of problems which includes this system as a special case. We prove the passivity-preservation property for the splitting methods, and we investigate stability and energy behaviour in numerical experiments. Implementation is discussed in detail for a special case where the splitting gives rise to the subsequent integration of two completely integrable flows. The equations for the attitude are reformulated on SO(3) using rotation matrices rather than local parametrizations with Euler angles.
