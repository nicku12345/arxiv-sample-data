We investigate the rate of convergence of linear sampling numbers of the embedding H^{\alpha,\beta} (\mathbb{T}^d) \hookrightarrow H^\gamma (\mathbb{T}^d). Here \alpha governs the mixed smoothness and \beta the isotropic smoothness in the space H^{\alpha,\beta}(\mathbb{T}^d) of hybrid smoothness, whereas H^{\gamma}(\mathbb{T}^d) denotes the isotropic Sobolev space. If \gamma>\beta we obtain sharp polynomial decay rates for the first embedding realized by sampling operators based on "energy-norm based sparse grids" for the classical trigonometric interpolation. This complements earlier work by Griebel, Knapek and D\~ung, Ullrich, where general linear approximations have been considered. In addition, we study the embedding H^\alpha_{mix} (\mathbb{T}^d) \hookrightarrow H^{\gamma}_{mix}(\mathbb{T}^d) and achieve optimality for Smolyak's algorithm applied to the classical trigonometric interpolation. This can be applied to investigate the sampling numbers for the embedding H^\alpha_{mix} (\mathbb{T}^d) \hookrightarrow L_q(\mathbb{T}^d) for 2<q\leq \infty where again Smolyak's algorithm yields the optimal order. The precise decay rates for the sampling numbers in the mentioned situations always coincide with those for the approximation numbers, except probably in the limiting situation \beta = \gamma (including the embedding into L_2(\mathbb{T}^d)). The best what we could prove there is a (probably) non-sharp results with a logarithmic gap between lower and upper bound.
