We derive upper bounds on the difference between the orthogonal projections of a smooth function u onto two finite element spaces that are nearby, in the sense that the support of every shape function belonging to one but not both of the spaces is contained in a common region whose measure tends to zero under mesh refinement. The bounds apply, in particular, to the setting in which the two finite element spaces consist of continuous functions that are elementwise polynomials over shape-regular, quasi-uniform meshes that coincide except on a region of measure O(h^\gamma), where \gamma is a nonnegative scalar and h is the mesh spacing. The projector may be, for example, the orthogonal projector with respect to the L^2- or H^1-inner product. In these and other circumstances, the bounds are superconvergent under a few mild regularity assumptions. That is, under mesh refinement, the two projections differ in norm by an amount that decays to zero at a faster rate than the amounts by which each projection differs from u. We present numerical examples to illustrate these superconvergent estimates and verify the necessity of the regularity assumptions on u.
