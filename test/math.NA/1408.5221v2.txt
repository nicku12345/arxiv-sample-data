In this paper we develop an adaptive procedure for the numerical solution of general, semilinear elliptic problems with possible singular perturbations. Our approach combines both a prediction-type adaptive Newton method and an adaptive finite element discretization (based on a robust a posteriori error analysis), thereby leading to a fully adaptive Newton-Galerkin scheme. Numerical experiments underline the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach for different examples.
