In this paper, we analyze a family of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for second order elliptic problems in two and three dimensions. The methods use piecewise polynomials of degree k\geqslant 0 for both the flux and numerical trace, and piecewise polynomials of degree k+1  for the potential. We establish error estimates for the numerical flux and potential under the minimal regularity condition. Moreover, we construct a local postprocessing for the flux, which produces a numerical flux with better conservation. Numerical experiments in two-space dimensions confirm our theoretical results.
