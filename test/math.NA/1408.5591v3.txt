In this paper, two kinds of high-order compact finite difference schemes for second-order derivative are developed. Then a second-order numerical scheme for Riemann-Liouvile derivative is established based on fractional center difference operator. We apply these methods to fractional anomalous subdiffusion equation to construct two kinds of novel numerical schemes. The solvability, stability and convergence analysis of these difference schemes are studied by Fourier method in details. The convergence orders of these numerical schemes are \mathcal {O}(\tau^2+h^6) and \mathcal {O}(\tau^2+h^8), respectively. Finally, numerical experiments are displayed which are in line with the theoretical analysis.
