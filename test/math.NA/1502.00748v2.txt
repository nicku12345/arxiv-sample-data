The tempered evolution equation describes the trapped dynamics, widely appearing in nature, e.g., the motion of living particles in viscous liquid. This paper proposes the fast predictor-corrector approach for the tempered fractional ordinary differential equations by digging out the potential 'very' short memory principle. The algorithms basing on the idea of equidistributing are detailedly described; their effectiveness and low computation cost, being linearly increasing with time t, are numerically demonstrated.
