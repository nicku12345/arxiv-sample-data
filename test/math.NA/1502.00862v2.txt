Generalized Fourier series with orthogonal polynomial bases have useful applications in several fields, including differential equations, pattern recognition, and image and signal processing. However, computing the generalized Fourier series can be a challenging problem even for relatively well behaved functions. In this paper a method for approximating a sparse collection of Fourier-like coefficients is presented that uses a collocation technique combined with an optimization problem inspired by recent results in compressed sensing research. The discussion includes approximation error rates and numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. One example displays the accuracy of the generalized Fourier series approximation for several test functions, while the other is an application of the generalized Fourier series approximation to rotation-invariant pattern recognition in images.
