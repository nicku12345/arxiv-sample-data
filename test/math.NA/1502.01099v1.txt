Superconvergence and a posteriori error estimators of recovery type are analyzed for the 4-node hybrid stress quadrilateral finite element method proposed by Pian and Sumihara (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engrg., 1984, 20: 1685-1695) for linear elasticity problems. Uniform superconvergence of order O(h^{1+\min\{\alpha,1\}}) with respect to the Lam\'{e} constant \lambda is established for both the recovered gradients of the displacement vector and the stress tensor under a mesh assumption, where \alpha>0 is a parameter characterizing the distortion of meshes from parallelograms to quadrilaterals. A posteriori error estimators based on the recovered quantities are shown to be asymptotically exact. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.
