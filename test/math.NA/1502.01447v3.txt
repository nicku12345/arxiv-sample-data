We constructed linear algorithms of sampling recovery and cubature formulas on Smolyak grids parametrized by m \in \mathbb{N} of periodic d-variate functions having Lipschitz-H\"older mixed smoothness \alpha > 0 based on B-spline quasi-interpolation, and studied their optimality. We established lower estimates (for \alpha \le 2) and upper bounds of the error of the optimal sampling recovery and the optimal integration on Smolyak grids, explicit in d, m and the number \nu of active variables of functions when d and m may be large.
