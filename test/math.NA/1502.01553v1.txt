We construct H(curl) and H(div) conforming finite elements on convex polygons and polyhedra with minimal possible degrees of freedom, i.e., the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of edges or faces of the polygon/polyhedron. The construction is based on generalized barycentric coordinates and the Whitney forms. In 3D, it currently requires the faces of the polyhedron be either triangles or parallelograms. Formula for computing basis functions are given. The finite elements satisfy discrete de Rham sequences in analogy to the well-known ones on simplices. Moreover, they reproduce existing H(curl)-H(div) elements on simplices, parallelograms, parallelepipeds, pyramids and triangular prisms. Approximation property of the constructed elements is also analyzed, by showing that the lowest-order simplicial Nedelec- Raviart-Thomas elements are subsets of the constructed elements on arbitrary polygons and certain polyhedra.
