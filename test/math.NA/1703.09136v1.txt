In this paper, we will introduce a new heterogeneous fast multipole method (H-FMM) for 2-D Helmholtz equation in layered media. To illustrate the main algorithm ideas, we focus on the case of two and three layers in this work. The key compression step in the H-FMM is based on a fact that the multipole expansion for the sources of the free-space Green's function can be used also to compress the far field of the sources of the layered-media or domain Green's function, and a similar result exists for the translation operators for the multipole and local expansions. The mathematical error analysis is shown rigorously by an image representation of the Sommerfeld spectral form of the domain Green's function. As a result, in the H-FMM algorithm, both the "multipole-to-multipole" and "local-to-local" translation operators are the same as those in the free-space case, allowing easy adaptation of existing free-space FMM. All the spatially variant information of the domain Green's function are collected into the "multipole-to-local" translations and therefore the FMM becomes "heterogeneous". The compressed representation further reduces the cost of evaluating the domain Green's function when computing the local direct interactions. Preliminary numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm with much improved performance over some existing methods for inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, we also show that, due to the equivalence between the complex line image representation and Sommerfeld integral representation of layered media Green's function, the new algorithm can be generalized to multi-layered media with minor modification where details for compression formulas, translation operators, and bookkeeping strategies will be addressed in a subsequent paper.
