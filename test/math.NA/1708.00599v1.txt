Approximate solutions of linear and nonlinear integral equations using methods related to an interpolatory projection involve many integrals which need to be evaluated using a numerical quadrature formula. In this paper, we consider discrete versions of the modified projection method and of the iterated modified projection methodfor solution of a Urysohn integral equation with a smooth kernel. For r \geq 1, a space of piecewise polynomials of degree less than or equal to r - 1 with respect to an uniform partition is chosen to be the approximating space and the projection is chosen to be the interpolatory projection at r Gauss points. The orders of convergence which we obtain for these discrete versions indicate the choice of numerical quadrature which preserves the orders of convergence. Numerical results are given for a specific example.
