In this paper, we develop a procedure for the detection of the contours of thermal bridges from thermographic images, in order to study the energetic performance of buildings. Two main steps of the above method are: the enhancement of the thermographic images by an optimized version of the mathematical algorithm for digital image processing based on the theory of sampling Kantorovich operators, and the application of a suitable thresholding based on the analysis of the histogram of the enhanced thermographic images. Finally, an accuracy improvement of the parameter that defines the thermal bridge is obtained.
