By our definition, "restricted Dirichlet-to-Neumann map" (DN) means that the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary data for a Coefficient Inverse Problem (CIP) are generated by a point source running along an interval of a straight line. On the other hand, the conventional DN data can be generated, at least sometimes, by a point source running along a hypersurface. CIPs with the restricted DN data are non-overdetermined in the n-D case with n \geq 2. We develop, in a unified way, a general and a radically new numerical concept for CIPs with restricted DN data for a broad class of PDEs of the second order, such as, e.g. elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic ones. Namely, using Carleman Weight Functions, we construct globally convergent numerical methods. H\"{o}lder stability and uniqueness are also proved. The price we pay for these features is a well acceptable one in the Numerical Analysis: we truncate a certain Fourier-like series with respect to some functions depending only on the position of that point source. At least three applications are: imaging of land mines, crosswell imaging and electrical impedance tomography.
