This paper develops a high-accuracy algorithm for time fractional wave problems, which employs a spectral method in the temporal discretization and a finite element method in the spatial discretization. Moreover, stability and convergence of this algorithm are derived, and numerical experiments are performed, demonstrating the exponential decay in the temporal discretization error provided the solution is sufficiently smooth.
