A new symbolic algorithmic implementation of the general scheme of the exponentially convergent functional-discrete (FD-) method is developed and justified for the Sturm-Liouville problem on a finite interval for the Schr\"odinger equation with a polynomial potential and the boundary conditions of Dirichlet type. The algorithm of the general scheme of our method is developed when the potential function is approximated by the piecewise-constant function. Our algorithm is symbolic and operates with the decomposition coefficients of the eigenfunction corrections in some basis. The number of summands in these decompositions depends on the degree of the potential polynomial and on the correction number. Our method uses the algebraic operations only and does not need solutions of any boundary value problems and computations of any integrals unlike the previously version. The numerical example illustrates the theoretical results.
