We build and analyze Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraint (BDDC) and Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting Dual Primal (FETI-DP) preconditioners for elliptic problems discretized by the virtual element method (VEM). We prove polylogarithmic condition number bounds, independent of the number of subdomains, the mesh size, and jumps in the diffusion coefficients. Numerical experiments confirm the theory.
