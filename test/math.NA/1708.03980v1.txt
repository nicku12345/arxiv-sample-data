The subdivision algorithm by Dellnitz and Hohmann for the computation of invariant sets of dynamical systems decomposes the relevant region of the state space into boxes and analyzes the induced box dynamics. Its convergence is proved in an idealized setting, assuming that the exact time evolution of these boxes can be computed.   In the present article, we show that slightly modified, directly implementable versions of the original algorithm are convergent under very mild assumptions on the dynamical system. In particular, we demonastrate that neither a fine net of sample points nor very accurate approximations of the precise dynamics are necessary to guarantee convergence of the overall scheme.
