Fractional partial differential equations with distributed-order fractional derivatives describe some important physical phenomena. In this paper, we propose a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for the distributed-order time and Riesz space fractional convection-diffusion and Schr\"odinger type equations. We prove stability and optimal order of convergence O(h^{N+1}+(\Delta t)^{1+\frac{\theta}{2}}+\theta^{2}) for the distributed-order time and space-fractional diffusion and Schr\"odinger type equations, an order of convergence of O(h^{N+\frac{1}{2}}+(\Delta t)^{1+\frac{\theta}{2}}+\theta^{2}) is established for the distributed-order time and Riesz space fractional convection-diffusion equations where \Delta t, h and \theta are the step sizes in time, space and distributed-order variables, respectively. Finally, the performed numerical experiments confirm the optimal order of convergence.
