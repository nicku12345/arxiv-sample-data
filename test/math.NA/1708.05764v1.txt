We consider the problem of approximating a function using Herglotz wave functions, which are a superposition of plane waves. When the discrepancy is measured in a ball, we show that the problem can essentially be solved by considering the function we wish to approximate as a source distribution and time reversing the resulting field. Unfortunately this gives generally poor approximations. Intuitively, this is because Herglotz wave functions are determined by a two-dimensional field and the function to approximate is three-dimensional. If the discrepancy is measured on a plane, we show that the best approximation corresponds to a low-pass filter, where only the spatial frequencies with length less than the wavenumber are kept. The corresponding Herglotz wave density can be found explicitly. Our results have application to designing standing acoustic waves for self-assembly of micro-particles in a fluid.
