This paper is the second one of two serial articles, whose goal is to prove convergence of HX Preconditioner (proposed by Hiptmair and Xu, 2007) for Maxwell's equations with jump coefficients. In this paper, based on the auxiliary results developed in the first paper (Hu, 2017), we establish a new regular Helmholtz decomposition for edge finite element functions in three dimensions, which is nearly stable with respect to a weight function. By using this Helmholtz decomposition, we give an analysis of the convergence of the HX preconditioner for the case with strongly discontinuous coefficients. We show that the HX preconditioner possesses fast convergence, which not only is nearly optimal with respect to the finite element mesh size but also is independent of the jumps in the coefficients across the interface between two neighboring subdomains.
