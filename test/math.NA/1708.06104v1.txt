The interior penalty methods using C^0 Lagrange elements (C^0IPG) developed in the last decade for the fourth order problems are an interesting topic in academia at present. In this paper, we discuss the adaptive fashion of C^0IPG method for the Helmholtz transmission eigenvalue problem.We give the a posteriori error indicators for primal and dual eigenfunctions, and prove their reliability and efficiency. We also give the a posteriori error indicator for eigenvalues and design a C^0IPG adaptive algorithm. Numerical experiments show that this algorithm is efficient and can get the optimal convergence rate.
