This report considers linear multistep methods through time filtering. The approach has several advantages. It is modular and requires the addition of only one line of additional code. Error estimation and variable timesteps is straightforward and the individual effect of each step\ is conceptually clear. We present its development for the backward Euler method and a curvature reducing time filter leading to a 2-step, strongly A-stable, second order linear multistep method.
