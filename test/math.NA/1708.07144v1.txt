Anisotropic Porous Medium Equation (APME) is developed as an extension of the Porous Medium Equation (PME) for anisotropic porous media. A special analytical solution is derived for APME for time-independent diffusion. Anisotropic mesh adaptation for linear finite element solution of APME is discussed and numerical results for two dimensional examples are presented. The solution errors using anisotropic adaptive meshes show second order convergence.
