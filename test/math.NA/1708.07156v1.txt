A smoothness-increasing accuracy conserving filtering approach to the regularization of discontinuities is presented for single domain spectral collocation approximations of hyperbolic conservation laws. The filter is based on convolution of a polynomial kernel that approximates a delta-sequence. The kernel combines a k^{th} order smoothness with an arbitrary number of {m} zero moments. The zero moments ensure a m^{th} order accurate approximation of the delta-sequence to the delta function. Through exact quadrature the projection error of the polynomial kernel on the spectral basis is ensured to be less than the moment error. A number of test cases on the advection equation, Burger's equation and Euler equations in 1D and 2D shown that the filter regularizes discontinuities while preserving high-order resolution
