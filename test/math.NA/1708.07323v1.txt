We consider families of finite elements on polygonal meshes, that are defined implicitly on each mesh cell as solutions of local Poisson problems with polynomial data. Functions in the local space on each mesh cell are evaluated via Nystr\"om discretizations of associated integral equations, allowing for curvilinear polygons and non-polynomial boundary data. Several experiments demonstrate the approximation quality of interpolated functions in these spaces.
