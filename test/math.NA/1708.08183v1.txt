Recently, we proposed a weak Galerkin finite element method for the Laplace eigenvalue problem. In this paper, we present two-grid and two-space skills to accelerate the weak Galerkin method. By choosing parameters properly, the two-grid and two-space weak Galerkin method not only doubles the convergence rate, but also maintains the asymptotic lower bounds property of the weak Galerkin method. Some numerical examples are provided to validate our theoretical analysis.
