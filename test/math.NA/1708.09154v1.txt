In this paper, we implement non-stiff interface tracking methods for the evolution of 2-D curves that follow Airy flow, a curvature-dependent dispersive geometric evolution law. The curvature of the curve satisfies the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, a dispersive non-linear soliton equation. We present a fully discrete space-time analysis of the equations (proof of convergence) and numerical evidence that confirms the accuracy, convergence, efficiency, and stability of the methods.
