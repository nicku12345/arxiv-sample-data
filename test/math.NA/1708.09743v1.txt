The theory of Chebyshev (uniform) approximation for univariate polynomial and piecewise polynomial functions has been studied for decades. The optimality conditions are based on the notion of alternating sequence. However, the extension the notion of alternating sequence to the case of multivariate functions is not trivial. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First of all, we give a geometrical interpretation of the necessary and sufficient optimality condition for multivariate approximation. These optimality conditions are not limited to the case polynomial approximation, where the basis functions are monomials. Second, we develop an algorithm for fast necessary optimality conditions verifications (polynomial case only). Although, this procedure only verifies the necessity, it is much faster than the necessary and sufficient conditions verification. This procedure is based on a point reduction procedure and resembles the univariate alternating sequence based optimality conditions. In the case of univariate approximation, however, these conditions are both necessary and sufficient. Third, we propose a procedure for necessary and sufficient optimality conditions verification that is based on a generalisation of the notion of alternating sequence to the case of multivariate polynomials.
