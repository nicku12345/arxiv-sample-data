The Bunch-Kaufman algorithm and Aasen's algorithm are two of the most widely used methods for solving symmetric indefinite linear systems, yet they both are known to suffer from occasional numerical instability due to potentially exponential element growth or unbounded entries in the matrix factorization. In this work, we develop a randomized complete pivoting (RCP) algorithm for solving symmetric indefinite linear systems. RCP is comparable to the Bunch-Kaufman algorithm and Aasen's algorithm in computational efficiency, yet enjoys theoretical element growth and bounded entries in the factorization comparable to that of complete-pivoting, up to a theoretical failure probability that exponentially decays with an oversampling parameter. Our finite precision analysis shows that RCP is as numerically stable as Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting, and RCP has been observed to be numerically stable in our extensive numerical experiments.
