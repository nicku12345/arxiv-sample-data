A new second-order method for approximating the compressible Euler equations is introduced. The method preserves all the known invariant domains of the Euler system: positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy and the local minimum principle on the specific entropy. The technique combines a first-order, invariant domain preserving, Guaranteed Maximum Speed method using a Graph Viscosity (GMS-GV1) with an invariant domain violating, but entropy consistent, high-order method. Invariant domain preserving auxiliary states, naturally produced by the GMS-GV1 method, are used to define local bounds for the high-order method which is then made invariant domain preserving via a convex limiting process. Numerical tests confirm the second-order accuracy of the new GMS-GV2 method in the maximum norm, where 2 stands for second-order. The proposed convex limiting is generic and can be applied to other approximation techniques and other hyperbolic systems.
