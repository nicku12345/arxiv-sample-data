We design, analyze and numerically validate a novel discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the coagulation-fragmentation equations. The DG discretization is applied to the conservative form of the model, with flux terms evaluated by Gaussian quadrature with Q=k+1 quadrature points for polynomials of degree k. The positivity of the numerical solution is enforced through a simple scaling limiter based on positive cell averages. The positivity of cell averages is propagated by the time discretization provided a proper time step restriction is imposed.
