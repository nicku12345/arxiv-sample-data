We propose a new numerical technique to deal with nonlinear terms in gradient flows. By introducing a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV), we construct efficient and robust energy stable schemes for a large class of gradient flows. The SAV approach is not restricted to specific forms of the nonlinear part of the free energy, and only requires to solve {\it decoupled} linear equations with {\it constant coefficients}. We use this technique to deal with several challenging applications which can not be easily handled by existing approaches, and present convincing numerical results to show that our schemes are not only much more efficient and easy to implement, but can also better capture the physical properties in these models. Based on this SAV approach, we can construct unconditionally second-order energy stable schemes; and we can easily construct even third or fourth order BDF schemes, although not unconditionally stable, which are very robust in practice. In particular, when coupled with an adaptive time stepping strategy, the SAV approach can be extremely efficient and accurate.
