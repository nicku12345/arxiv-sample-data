In this paper, we construct explicit nonstandard Runge-Kutta (ENRK) methods which have higher accuracy order and preserve two important properties of autonomous dynamical systems, namely, the positivity and linear stability. These methods are based on the classical explicit Runge-Kutta methods, where instead of the usual h in the formulas there stands a function \varphi (h). It is proved that the constructed methods preserve the accuracy order of the original Runge-Kutta methods. The numerical simulations confirm the validity of the obtained theoretical results.
