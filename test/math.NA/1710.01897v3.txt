We analyse the convergence of numerical schemes in the GDM-ELLAM (Gradient Discretisation Method-Eulerian Lagrangian Localised Adjoint Method) framework for a strongly coupled elliptic-parabolic PDE which models miscible displacement in porous media. These schemes include, but are not limited to Mixed Finite Element-ELLAM and Hybrid Mimetic Mixed-ELLAM schemes. A complete convergence analysis is presented on the coupled model, using only weak regularity assumptions on the solution (which are satisfied in practical applications), and not relying on L^\infty bounds (which are impossible to ensure at the discrete level given the anisotropic diffusion tensors and the general grids used in applications).
