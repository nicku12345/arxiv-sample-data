The Evans function has been used extensively to study spectral stability of travelling-wave solutions in spatially extended partial differential equations. To compute Evans functions numerically, several shooting methods have been developed. In this paper, an alternative scheme for the numerical computation of Evans functions is presented that relies on an appropriate boundary-value problem formulation. Convergence of the algorithm is proved, and several examples, including the computation of eigenvalues for a multi-dimensional problem, are given. The main advantage of the scheme proposed here compared with earlier methods is that the scheme is linear and scalable to large problems.
