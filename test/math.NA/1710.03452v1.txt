We devise new variants of the following nonconforming finite element methods: DG methods of fixed arbitrary order for the Poisson problem, the Crouzeix-Raviart interior penalty method for linear elasticity, and the quadratic C^0 interior penalty method for the biharmonic problem. Each variant differs from the original method only in the discretization of the right-hand side. Before applying the load functional, a linear operator transforms nonconforming discrete test functions into conforming functions such that stability and consistency are improved. The new variants are thus quasi-optimal with respect to an extension of the energy norm. Furthermore, their quasi-optimality constants are uniformly bounded for shape regular meshes and tend to 1 as the penalty parameter increases.
