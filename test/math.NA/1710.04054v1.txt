We are interested in the numerical approximation of the hydrostatic free surface incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By using a layer-averaged version of the equations, we are able to extend previous results obtained for shallow water system. We derive a vertically implicit / horizontally explicit finite volume kinetic scheme that ensures the positivity of the approximated water depth, the well-balancing and a fully discrete energy inequality.
