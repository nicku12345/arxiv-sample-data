A triangular plate-bending element with a new multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is proposed and a novel multiresolution element method is hence presented. The MRA framework is formulated out of a displacement subspace sequence whose basis functions are built out of scaling and shifting on the element domain of basic full node shape function. The basic full node shape function is constructed by means of extending the shape function triangle domain for a split node at the zero coordinates to the hexagon area enclosing the zero coordinates. As a result, a new split-full node notion is presented and a novel rational MRA concept together with the resolution level (RL) is constituted for the element. Via practical examples, it is found that the traditional triangular plate element and method is a mono-resolution one and also a special case of the proposed element and method. The meshing for the monoresolution plate element model is based on the empiricism while the RL adjusting for the multiresolution is laid on the rigorous mathematical basis. The analysis clarity of a plate structure is actually determined by the RL, not by the mesh. Thus, the accuracy of a structural analysis is replaced by the clarity, the irrational MRA by the rational and the mesh model by the RL that is the discretized model by the integrated. The continuous full node shape function unveils secrets behind assembling artificially of node-related items in global matrix formation by the conventional FEM.
