In this paper we suggest a method for transforming a vector subdivision scheme generating C^{\ell} limits to another such scheme of the same dimension, generating C^{\ell+1} limits. In scalar subdivision, it is well known that a scheme generating C^{\ell} limit curves can be transformed to a new scheme producing C^{\ell+1} limit curves by multiplying the scheme's symbol with the smoothing factor \tfrac{z+1}{2}. We extend this approach to vector and Hermite subdivision schemes, by manipulating symbols. The algorithms presented in this paper allow to construct vector (Hermite) subdivision schemes of arbitrarily high regularity from a convergent vector scheme (from a Hermite scheme whose Taylor scheme is convergent with limit functions of vanishing first component).
