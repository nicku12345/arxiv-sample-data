We consider nonlocal nonlinear potentials and estimate the rate of convergence of time stepping schemes to the peridynamic equation of motion. We begin by establishing the existence of H^2 solutions over any finite time interval. Here spatial approximation by finite element interpolations are considered. The energy stability of the associated semi-discrete time stepping scheme is established and the approximation of strong and weak formulations of the evolution using FE interpolations of H^2 solutions are investigated. The strong and weak form of approximations are shown to converge to the actual solution in the mean square norm at the rate C_t\Delta t +C_s h^2/\epsilon^2 where h is the mesh size, \epsilon is the size of nonlocal interaction and \Delta t is the time step. The constants C_t and C_s are independent of \Delta t, and h. In the absence of nonlinearity a CFL like condition for the energy stability of the central difference time discretization scheme is developed.
