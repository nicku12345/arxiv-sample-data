Uniform LBB conditions are desirable to approximate the solution of Navier-Stokes, Oseen, and Stokes equations on anisotropic meshes and to enable anisotropic refinements. We prove such conditions for the second order Taylor-Hood pairs \mathbb{Q}_2 \times \mathbb{Q}_1 and \mathbb{P}_2 \times \mathbb{P}_1 on a class of anisotropic meshes. These meshes may contain refined edge and corner patches. To this end, we generalise Verf\"urth's trick and recent results by some of the authors.
