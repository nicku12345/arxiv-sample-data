This paper proposes and analyzes a class of new weak Galerkin (WG) finite element methods for 2- and 3-dimensional linear elasticity problems. The methods use discontinuous piecewise-polynomial approximations of degrees k(\geq 0) for the stress, k+1 for the displacement, and a continuous piecewise-polynomial approximation of degree k+1 for the displacement trace on the inter-element boundaries, respectively. After the local elimination of unknowns defined in the interior of elements, the WG methods result in SPD systems where the unknowns are only the degrees of freedom describing the continuous trace approximation. We show that the proposed methods are robust in the sense that the derived a priori error estimates are optimal and uniform with respect to the Lam\'{e} constant \lambda. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.
