We prove that the a standard adaptive algorithm for the Taylor-Hood discretization of the stationary Stokes problem converges with optimal rate. This is done by developing an abstract framework for indefinite problems which allows us to prove general quasi-orthogonality proposed in [Carstensen et al., 2014]. This property is the main obstacle towards the optimality proof and therefore is the main focus of this work. The key ingredient is a new connection between the mentioned quasi-orthogonality and LU-factorizations of infinite matrices.
