The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework is a high-performance, open source, C++ finite element toolkit developed at Idaho National Laboratory. MOOSE was created with the aim of assisting domain scientists and engineers in creating customizable, high-quality tools for multiphysics simulations. While the core MOOSE framework itself does not contain code for simulating any particular physical application, it is distributed with a number of physics "modules" which are tailored to solving e.g. heat conduction, phase field, and solid/fluid mechanics problems. In this report, we describe the basic equations, finite element formulations, software implementation, and regression/verification tests currently available in MOOSE's navier_stokes module for solving the Incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations.
