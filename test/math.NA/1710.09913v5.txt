This paper is focused on the double-grid integration with interpolation-projection (DoGIP), which is a novel matrix-free discretisation method of variational formulations introduced for Fourier--Galerkin approximation. Here, it is described as a more general approach with an application to the finite element method (FEM) on simplexes. The approach is based on treating the trial and a test function in variational formulation together, which leads to the decomposition of a linear system into interpolation and (block) diagonal matrices. It usually leads to reduced memory demands, especially for higher-order basis functions, but with higher computational requirements. The numerical examples are studied here for two variational formulations: weighted projection and scalar elliptic problem modelling, e.g. diffusion or stationary heat transfer. This paper also opens a room for further investigation, which is discussed in the conclusion.
