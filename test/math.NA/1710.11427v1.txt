In this article we develop an hp-adaptive refinement procedure for Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to the homogeneous Helmholtz problem. Our approach combines not only mesh subdivision (h-refinement) and local basis enrichment (p-refinement), but also incorporates local directional adaptivity, whereby the elementwise plane wave basis is aligned with the dominant scattering direction. Numerical experiments based on employing an empirical a posteriori error indicator clearly highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach for various examples.
