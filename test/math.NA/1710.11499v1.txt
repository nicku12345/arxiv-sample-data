The smooth fixed volume discrepancy in the periodic case is studied here. It is proved that the Frolov point sets adjusted to the periodic case have optimal in a certain sense order of decay of the smooth periodic discrepancy. The upper bounds for the r-smooth fixed volume periodic discrepancy for these sets are established.
