In this work a stabilised and reduced Galerkin projection of the incompressible unsteady Navier-Stokes equations for moderate Reynolds number is presented. The full-order model, on which the Galerkin projection is applied, is based on a finite volumes approximation. The reduced basis spaces are constructed with a POD approach. Two different pressure stabilisation strategies are proposed and compared: the former one is based on the supremizer enrichment of the velocity space, and the latter one is based on a pressure Poisson equation approach.
