This paper studies diagonal implicit symplectic extended Runge--Kutta--Nystr\"{o}m (ERKN) methods for solving the oscillatory Hamiltonian system H(q,p)=\dfrac{1}{2}p^{T}p+\dfrac{1}{2}q^{T}Mq+U(q). Based on symplectic conditions and order conditions, we construct some diagonal implicit symplectic ERKN methods. The stability of the obtained methods is discussed. Three numerical experiments are carried out and the numerical results demonstrate the remarkable numerical behavior of the new diagonal implicit symplectic methods when applied to the oscillatory Hamiltonian system.
