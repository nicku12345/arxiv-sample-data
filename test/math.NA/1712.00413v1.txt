This paper presents two modular grad-div algorithms for calculating solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). These algorithms add to an NSE code a minimally intrusive module that implements grad-div stabilization. The algorithms do not suffer from either breakdown (locking) or debilitating slow down for large values of grad-div parameters. Stability and optimal-order convergence of the methods are proven. Numerical tests confirm the theory and illustrate the benefits of these algorithms over a fully coupled grad-div stabilization.
