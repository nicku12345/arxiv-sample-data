This paper is concerned with the study, by computational means, of the generation and stability of solitary-wave solutions of generalized versions of the Benjamin equation. The numerical generation of the solitary-wave profiles is accurately performed with a modified Petviashvili method which includes extrapolation to accelerate the convergence. In order to study the dynamics of the solitary waves the equations are discretized in space with a Fourier pseudospectral collocation method and a fourth-order, diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method of composition type as time-stepping integrator. The stability of the waves is numerically studied by performing experiments with small and large perturbations of the solitary pulses as well as interactions of solitary waves.
