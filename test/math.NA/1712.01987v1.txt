In this paper, we consider the wave propagation with   Debye polarization in nonlinear dielectric materials. For this model, the Rother's method is employed to derive the well-posedness of the electric fields and the existence of the polarized fields by monotonicity theorem as well as the boundedness of the two fields are established. Then, the time errors are derived for the semi-discrete solutions by the order O(\Delta t).   Subsequently, decoupled the full-discrete scheme of the Euler in time and Raviart-Thomas-N\acute{e}d\acute{e}lec element k\geq 2 in spatial is established. Based on the truncated error, we present the convergent analysis with the order O(\Delta t+h^s)  under the technique of a-prior L^\infty assumption. For the k=1, we employ the superconvergence technique to ensure the a-prior L^\infty assumption. In the end, we give some numerical examples to demonstrate our theories.
