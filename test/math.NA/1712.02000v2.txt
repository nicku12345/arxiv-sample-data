We propose a new joint image reconstruction method by recovering edge directly from observed data. More specifically, we reformulate joint image reconstruction with vectorial total-variation regularization as an l_1 minimization problem of the Jacobian of the underlying multi-modality or multi-contrast images. Derivation of data fidelity for Jacobian and transformation of noise distribution are also detailed. The new minimization problem yields an optimal O(1/k^2) convergence rate, where k is the iteration number, and the per-iteration cost is low thanks to the close-form matrix-valued shrinkage. We conducted numerical tests on a number multi-contrast magnetic resonance image (MRI) datasets, which show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction efficiency and accuracy compared to the state-of-the-arts.
