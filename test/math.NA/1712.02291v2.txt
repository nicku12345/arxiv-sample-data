This article deals with the numerical analysis of the Cauchy problem for the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a finite difference scheme. We consider the Rusanov scheme for the hyperbolic flux term and a 4-points \theta-scheme for the dispersive term. We prove the convergence under a hyperbolic Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition when \theta\geq \frac{1}{2} and under an "Airy" Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition when \theta<\frac{1}{2}. More precisely, we get the first order convergence rate for strong solutions in the Sobolev space H^s(\mathbb{R}), s \geq 6 and extend this result to the non-smooth case for initial data in H^s(\mathbb{R}), with s\geq \frac{3}{4} , to the price of a loss in the convergence order. Numerical simulations indicate that the orders of convergence may be optimal when s\geq3.
