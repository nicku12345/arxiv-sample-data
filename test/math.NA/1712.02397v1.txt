This research presents a new turbulence generation method based on stochastic wavelets and tests its various properties in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous turbulence. Turbulence field can be generated with less basis compared to previous synthetic Fourier methods. Adaptive generation of inhomogeneous turbulence is achieved by scale reduction algorithm and lead to smaller computation cost. The generated turbulence shows good agreement with input data and theoretical results.
