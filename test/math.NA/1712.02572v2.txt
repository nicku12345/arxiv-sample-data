We investigate quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration over the s-dimensional unit cube based on rank-1 lattice point sets in weighted non-periodic Sobolev spaces \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{sob}}) and their subspaces of high order smoothness \alpha>1, where \boldsymbol{\gamma} denotes a set of the weights. A recent paper by Dick, Nuyens and Pillichshammer has studied QMC integration in half-period cosine spaces with smoothness parameter \alpha>1/2 consisting of non-periodic smooth functions, denoted by \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{cos}}), and also in the sum of half-period cosine spaces and Korobov spaces with common parameter \alpha, denoted by \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{kor}+\mathrm{cos}}). Motivated by the results shown there, we first study embeddings and norm equivalences on those function spaces. In particular, for an integer \alpha, we provide their corresponding norm-equivalent subspaces of \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{sob}}). This implies that \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{kor}+\mathrm{cos}}) is strictly smaller than \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{sob}}) as sets for \alpha \geq 2, which solves an open problem by Dick, Nuyens and Pillichshammer. Then we study the worst-case error of tent-transformed lattice rules in \mathcal{H}(K_{2,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{sob}}) and also the worst-case error of symmetrized lattice rules in an intermediate space between \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{kor}+\mathrm{cos}}) and \mathcal{H}(K_{\alpha,\boldsymbol{\gamma},s}^{\mathrm{sob}}). We show that the almost optimal rate of convergence can be achieved for both cases, while a weak dependence of the worst-case error bound on the dimension can be obtained for the former case.
