In this work, we study advection-robust Hybrid High-Order discretizations of the Oseen equations. For a given integer k\ge 0, the discrete velocity unknowns are vector-valued polynomials of total degree \le k on mesh elements and faces, while the pressure unknowns are discontinuous polynomials of total degree \le k on the mesh. From the discrete unknowns, three relevant quantities are reconstructed inside each element: a velocity of total degree \le(k+1), a discrete advective derivative, and a discrete divergence. These reconstructions are used to formulate the discretizations of the viscous, advective, and velocity-pressure coupling terms, respectively. Well-posedness is ensured through appropriate high-order stabilization terms. We prove energy error estimates that are advection-robust for the velocity, and show that each mesh element T of diameter h_T contributes to the discretization error with an \mathcal{O}(h_T^{k+1})-term in the diffusion-dominated regime, an \mathcal{O}(h_T^{k+\frac12})-term in the advection-dominated regime, and scales with intermediate powers of h_T in between. Numerical results complete the exposition.
