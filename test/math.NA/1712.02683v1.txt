We develop summation by parts (SBP) approach for generating high-order finite-difference schemes on the interval and propose new sets of schemes up to the 12th order. The coefficients of the schemes are governed by values of grid spacing near the ends of the interval: we shift one or two or three nodes at the ends of originally equidistant grid. The new finite-difference operators use forward and backward differences to avoid saw-tooth spurious solutions. Test computations point out two schemes (of 8th and 10th orders) that have the best accuracy among others; we yield the coefficients of new schemes.
