In this paper, we carry out stability and error analyses for two first-order, semi-discrete time stepping schemes, which are based on the newly developed Invariant Energy Quadratization approach, for solving the well-known Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations with general nonlinear bulk potentials. Some reasonable sufficient conditions about boundedness and continuity of the nonlinear functional are given in order to obtain optimal error estimates. These conditions are naturally satisfied by two commonly used nonlinear potentials including the double-well potential and regularized logarithmic Flory-Huggins potential. The well-posedness, unconditional energy stabilities and optimal error estimates of the numerical schemes are proved rigorously.
