A popular and efficient discretization of evolutions involving the singular p-Laplace operator is based on a factorization of the differential operator into a linear part which is treated implicitly and a regularized singular factor which is treated explicitly. It is shown that an unconditional energy stability property for this semi-implicit time stepping strategy holds. Related error estimates depend critically on a required regularization parameter. Numerical experiments reveal reduced experimental convergence rates for smaller regularization parameters and thereby confirm that this dependence cannot be avoided in general.
