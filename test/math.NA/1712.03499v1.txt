In this paper we present theory, algorithms and applications for regression over the max- plus semiring. We show how max-plus 2-norm regression can be used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates for three different inverse problems. Namely inferring a max-plus linear dynamical systems model from a noisy time series recording, inferring the edge lengths of a network from shortest path information and fitting a max-plus polynomial function to data.
