In this article, firstly we develop a method for a type of difference equations, applicable to solve approximately a class of first order ordinary differential equation systems. In a second step, we apply the results obtained to solve a non-linear two point boundary value problem relating a flight mechanics model. We highlight the algorithm obtained seems to be robust and of easy computational implementation.
