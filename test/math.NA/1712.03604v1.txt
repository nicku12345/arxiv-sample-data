A theory of rank k\ge 2 perturbation of symplectic matrices and Hamiltonian systems with periodic coefficients using a base of isotropic subspaces, is presented. After showing that the fundamental matrix {\displaystyle \left(\widetilde{X}(t)\right)_{t\ge 0}} of the rank k perturbation of Hamiltonian system with periodic coefficients and the rank k perturbation of the fundamental matrix {\displaystyle \left(X(t)\right)_{t\ge 0}} of the unperturbed system are the same, the Jordan canonical form of {\displaystyle \left(\widetilde{X}(t)\right)_{t\ge 0}} is given. Two numerical examples illustrating this theory and the consequences of rank k perturbations on the strong stability of Hamiltonian systems were also given.
