In the paper, we construct a new quadratic spline-wavelet basis on the interval and a unit square satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions of the first order. Wavelets have one vanishing moment and the shortest support among known quadratic spline wavelets adapted to the same type of boundary conditions. Stiffness matrices arising from a discretization of the second-order elliptic problems using the constructed wavelet basis have uniformly bounded condition numbers and the condition numbers are small. We present quantitative properties of the constructed basis. We provide numerical examples to show that the Galerkin method and the adaptive wavelet method using our wavelet basis requires smaller number of iterations than these methods with other quadratic spline wavelet bases. Moreover, due to the short support of the wavelets one iteration requires smaller number of floating point operations.
