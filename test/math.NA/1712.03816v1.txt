This paper studies generic and perturbation properties inside the linear space of m\times (m+n) polynomial matrices whose rows have degrees bounded by a given list d_1, \ldots, d_m of natural numbers, which in the particular case d_1 = \cdots = d_m = d is just the set of m\times (m+n) polynomial matrices with degree at most d. Thus, the results in this paper extend to a much more general setting the results recently obtained in [Van Dooren & Dopico, Linear Algebra Appl. (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2017.05.011] only for polynomial matrices with degree at most d. Surprisingly, most of the properties proved in [Van Dooren & Dopico, Linear Algebra Appl. (2017)], as well as their proofs, remain to a large extent unchanged in this general setting of row degrees bounded by a list that can be arbitrarily inhomogeneous provided the well-known Sylvester matrices of polynomial matrices are replaced by the new trimmed Sylvester matrices introduced in this paper. The following results are presented, among many others, in this work: (1) generically the polynomial matrices in the considered set are minimal bases with their row degrees exactly equal to d_1, \ldots , d_m, and with right minimal indices differing at most by one and having a sum equal to \sum_{i=1}^{m} d_i, and (2), under perturbations, these generic minimal bases are robust and their dual minimal bases can be chosen to vary smoothly.
