The Bessel-Neumann expansion (of integer order) of a function g:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C} corresponds to representing g as a linear combination of basis functions \phi_0,\phi_1,\ldots, i.e., g(z)=\sum_{\ell = 0}^\infty w_\ell \phi_\ell(s), where \phi_i(z)=J_i(z), i=0,\ldots, are the Bessel functions. In this work, we study an expansion for a more general class of basis functions. More precisely, we assume that the basis functions satisfy an infinite dimensional linear ordinary differential equation associated with a Hessenberg matrix, motivated by the fact that these basis functions occur in certain iterative methods. A procedure to compute the basis functions as well as the coefficients is proposed. Theoretical properties of the expansion are studied. We illustrate that non-standard basis functions can give faster convergence than the Bessel functions.
