We define Euclid polynomials E_{k+1}(\lambda) = E_{k}(\lambda)\left(E_{k}(\lambda) - 1\right) + 1 and E_{1}(\lambda) = \lambda + 1 in analogy to Euclid numbers e_k = E_{k}(1). We show how to construct companion matrices \mathbb{E}_k, so E_k(\lambda) = \operatorname{det}\left(\lambda\mathbf{I} - \mathbb{E}_{k}\right), of height 1 (and thus of minimal height over all integer companion matrices for E_{k}(\lambda)). We prove various properties of these objects, and give experimental confirmation of some unproved properties.
