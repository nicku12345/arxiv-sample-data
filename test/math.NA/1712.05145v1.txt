In this paper, we first introduce the reader to the Basic Scheme of Moulinec and Suquet in the setting of quasi-static linear elasticity, which takes advantage of the fast Fourier transform on homogenized microstructures to accelerate otherwise time-consuming computations. By means of an asymptotic expansion, a hierarchy of linear problems is derived, whose solutions are looked at in detail. It is highlighted how these generalized homogenization problems depend on each other. We extend the Basic Scheme to fit this new problem class and give some numerical results for the first two problem orders.
