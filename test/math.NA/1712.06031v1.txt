The Loewner framework for model order reduction is applied to the class of infinite-dimension systems. The transfer function of such systems is irrational (as opposed to linear systems, whose transfer function is rational) and can be expressed as an infinite series of rational functions. The main advantage of the method is the fact that reduced orders models are constructed using only input-output measurements. The procedure can be directly applied to the original transfer function or to the one obtained from the finite element discretization of the PDE. Significantly better results are obtained when using it directly, as it is presented in the experiments section.
