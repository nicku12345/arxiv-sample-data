Ensemble calculations are essential for systems with uncertain data but require substantial increase in computational resources. This increase severely limits ensemble size. To reach beyond current limits, we present a first-order artificial compressibility ensemble algorithm. This algorithm effectively decouples the velocity and pressure solve via artificial compression, thereby reducing computational complexity and execution time. Further reductions in storage and computation time are achieved via a splitting of the convective term. Nonlinear energy stability and first-order convergence of the method are proven under a CFL-type condition involving fluctuations of the velocity. Numerical tests are provided which confirm the theoretical analyses and illustrate the value of ensemble calculations.
