We deal with the approximate solution of initial value problems in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces with a Schauder basis. We only allow finite-dimensional algorithms acting in the spaces \rr^N, with varying N. The error of such algorithms depends on two parameters: the truncation parameters N and a discretization parameter n. For a class of C^r right-hand side functions, we define an algorithm with varying N, based on possibly non-uniform mesh, and we analyse its error and cost. For constant N, we show a matching (up to a constant) lower bound on the error of any algorithm in terms of N and n, as N,n\to \infty. We stress that in the standard error analysis the dimension N is fixed, and the dependence on N is usually hidden in error coefficient. For a certain model of cost, for many cases of interest, we show tight (up to a constant) upper and lower bounds on the minimal cost of computing an \e-approximation to the solution (the \e-complexity of the problem). The results are illustrated by an example of the initial value problem in the weighted \ell_p space (1\leq p<\infty).
