In this work we present a new approach for the implementation of operational Tau method for the solutions of linear differential and integral equations. In our approach we use the three terms relation of an orthogonal polynomial basis to compute the operational matrices. We also give numerical applications of operational matrices to solve differential and integral problems using the operational Tau method.
