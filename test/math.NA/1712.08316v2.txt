In this paper, we develop global superconvergence estimates for the lowest order Raviart--Thomas mixed finite element method for second order elliptic equations with general boundary conditions on triangular meshes, where most pairs of adjacent triangles form approximate parallelograms. In particular, we prove the L^{2}-distance between the numerical solution and canonical interpolant for the vector variable is of order 1+\rho, where \rho\in(0,1] is dependent on the mesh structure. By a cheap local postprocessing operator G_{h}, we prove the L^{2}-distance between the exact solution and the postprocessed numerical solution for the vector variable is of order 1+\rho. As a byproduct, we also obtain the superconvergence estimate for Crouzeix--Raviart nonconforming finite elements on triangular meshes of the same type.
