We propose a new mixed finite element method for the three-dimensional steady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kinematics equations for which the velocity of the fluid is given. Although prescribing the velocity field leads to a simpler model than full MHD equations, its conservative and efficient numerical methods are still active research topic. The distinctive feature of our discrete scheme is that the divergence-free conditions for current density and magnetic induction are both satisfied. To reach this goal, we use magnetic vector potential to represent magnetic induction and resort to H(div)-conforming element to discretize the current density. We develop an preconditioned iterative solver based on a block preconditioner for the algebraic systems arising from the discretization. Several numerical experiments are implemented to verify the divergence-free properties, the convergence rate of the finite element scheme and the robustness of the preconditioner.
