Both practice and analysis of adaptive p-FEMs and hp-FEMs raise the question what increment in the current polynomial degree p guarantees a p-independent reduction of the Galerkin error. We answer this question for the p-FEM in the simplified context of homogeneous Dirichlet problems for the Poisson equation in the two dimensional unit square with polynomial data of degree p. We show that an increment proportional to p yields a p-robust error reduction and provide computational evidence that a constant increment does not.
