We propose a new discontinuous Galerkin method based on the least-squares patch reconstruction for the biharmonic problem. We prove the optimal error estimate of the proposed method. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical examples are presented to confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the method with several boundary conditions and several types of polygon meshes and polyhedral meshes.
