In this paper we will consider two curl-curl equation in two dimensions. One curl-curl problem for a scalar quantity F and one problem for a vector field \bf{E}. For Dirichlet boundary conditions \bf{n} \times \bf{E} =  \hat{E}_{\dashv} on \bf{E} and Neumann boundary conditions \bf{n} \times \mbox{curl} F=\hat{E}_{\dashv}, we expect the solutions to satisfy \bf{E}=\mbox{curl} F. When we use algebraic dual polynomial representations, these identities continue to hold at the discrete level. Equivalence will be proved and illustrated with a computational example.
