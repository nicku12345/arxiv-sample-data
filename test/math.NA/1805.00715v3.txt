For some Poisson-type model problem, we prove that adaptive FEM driven by the (h-h/2)-type error estimators from [Ferraz-Leite, Ortner, Praetorius, Numer. Math. 116 (2010)] leads to convergence with optimal algebraic convergence rates. Besides the implementational simplicity, another striking feature of these estimators is that they can provide guaranteed lower bounds for the energy error with known efficiency constant 1.
