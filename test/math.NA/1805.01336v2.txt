In this paper, we consider the finite element approximation for a parabolic problem on a smooth domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N with the inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition. We emphasize that the domain can be non-convex in general. We implement the finite element method for this problem by constructing a family of polygonal or polyhedral domains \{ \Omega_h \}_h that approximate the original domain \Omega. The main result of this study is the L^\infty-error estimate for this approximation. We shall show that the convergence rate is not optimal for higher order elements since the symmetric difference \Omega \bigtriangleup \Omega_h is not empty in general. In order to address the effect of the symmetric difference of domains, we introduce the tubular neighborhood of the original boundary \partial\Omega. We will also present a slightly new approach to establish the L^\infty-error estimate. Moreover, we present the smoothing property for the discrete parabolic semigroup and the spatially discretized maximal regularity as corollaries of the main result.
