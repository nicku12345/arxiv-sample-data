We consider model order reduction for a free boundary problem of an osmotic cell that is parameterized by material parameters as well as the initial shape of the cell. Our approach is based on an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian description of the model that is discretized by a mass-conservative finite element scheme. Using reduced basis techniques and empirical interpolation, we construct a parameterized reduced order model in which the mass conservation property of the full-order model is exactly preserved. Numerical experiments are provided that highlight the performance of the resulting reduced order model.
