The matrix pencil method is an eigenvalue based approach for the parameter identification of sparse exponential sums. We derive a reconstruction algorithm for multivariate exponential sums that is based on simultaneous diagonalization. Randomization is used and quantified to reduce the simultaneous diagonalization to the eigendecomposition of a single random matrix. To verify feasibility, the algorithm is applied to synthetic and experimental fluorescence microscopy data.
