In this paper, we first construct the H^2(curl)-conforming finite elements both on a rectangle and a triangle. They possess some fascinating properties which have been proven by a rigorous theoretical analysis. Then we apply the elements to construct a finite element space for discretizing quad-curl problems. Convergence orders O(h^k) in the H(curl) norm and O(h^{k-1}) in the H^2(curl) norm are established. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm our theoretical results.
