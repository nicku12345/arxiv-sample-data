In this paper, two nonconforming finite element schemes that use piecewise cubic and piecewise quartic polynomials respectively are constructed for the planar biharmonic equation with optimal convergence rates on general shape-regular triangulations. Therefore, it is proved that optimal finite element schemes of arbitrary order for planar biharmonic equation can be constructed on general shape-regular triangulations.
