The pivotal aim of the present work is to demonstrate an efficient analytical technique, called q-homotopy analysis transform method (q-HATM) in order to analyse a fractional model of telegraph equations. Numerical examples are illustrated to examine the efficiency of the proposed technique. The numerical solutions are obtained in the form of a series solution. The proposed method manipulates and controls the series solution, which rapidly converges to the exact solution in a short admissible domain in an efficient manner.
