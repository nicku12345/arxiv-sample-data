We provide new insights into the a priori theory for a time-stepping scheme based on least-squares finite element methods for parabolic first-order systems. The elliptic part of the problem is of general reaction-convection-diffusion type. The new ingredient in the analysis is an elliptic projection operator defined via a non-symmetric bilinear form, although the main bilinear form corresponding to the least-squares functional is symmetric. This new operator allows to prove optimal error estimates in the natural norm associated to the problem and, under additional regularity assumptions, in the L^2 norm. Numerical experiments are presented which confirm our theoretical findings.
