Trigonometric integrators for oscillatory linear Hamiltonian differential equations are considered. Under a condition of Hairer & Lubich on the filter functions in the method, a modified energy is derived that is exactly preserved by trigonometric integrators. This implies and extends a known result on all-time near-conservation of energy. The extension can be applied to linear wave equations.
