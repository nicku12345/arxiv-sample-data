We propose an energy-conserving ultra-weak discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the generalized Korteweg-De Vries(KdV) equation in one dimension. Optimal a priori error estimate of order k + 1 is obtained for the semi-discrete scheme for the KdV equation without convection term on general nonuniform meshes when polynomials of degree k\ge 2 is used. We also numerically observed optimal convergence of the method for the KdV equation with linear or nonlinear convection terms.   It is numerically observed for the new method to have a superior performance for long-time simulations over existing DG methods.
