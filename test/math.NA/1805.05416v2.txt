We study the properties of sparse reconstruction of transformed \ell_1 (TL1) minimization and present improved theoretical results about the recoverability and the accuracy of this reconstruction from undersampled measurements. We then combine this method with the stochastic collocation approach to identify the coefficients of sparse orthogonal polynomial expansions for uncertainty quantification. In order to implement the TL1 minimization, we use the DCA-TL1 algorithm which was introduced by Zhang and Xin. In particular, when recover non-sparse functions, we adopt an adaptive DCA-TL1 method to guarantee the sparest solutions. Various numerical examples, including sparse polynomial functions recovery and non-sparse analytical functions recovery are presented to demonstrate the recoverability and efficiency of this novel method and its potential for problems of practical interests.
