We consider functions on the d-dimensional unit cube whose partial derivatives up to order r are bounded by one. It is known that the minimal number of function values that is needed to approximate the integral of such functions up to the error \varepsilon is of order (d/ \varepsilon)^{d/r}. Among other things, we show that the minimal number of function values that is needed to approximate such functions in the uniform norm is of order (d^{r/2} /\varepsilon)^{d/r} whenever r is even.
