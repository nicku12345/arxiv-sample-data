In this paper, generalized aspects of least square homotopy perturbations are explored to treat the system of non-linear fractional partial differential equations and the method is called as generalized least square homotopy perturbations (GLSHP). The concept of partial fractional Wronskian is introduced to detect the linear independence of functions depending on more than one variable through Caputo fractional calculus. General theorem related to Wronskian is also proved. It is found that solutions converge more rapidly through GLSHP in comparison to classical fractional homotopy perturbations. Results of this generalization are validated by taking examples from nonlinear fractional wave equations.
