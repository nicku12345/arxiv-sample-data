There is proposed a method for improving the convergence of Fourier series by function systems, orthogonal at the segment, the application of which allows for smooth functions to receive uniformly convergent series. There is also proposed the method of phantom nodes improving the convergence of interpolation polynomials on systems of orthogonal functions, the application of which in many cases can significantly reduce the interpolation errors of these polynomials. The results of calculations are given at test cases using the proposed methods for trigonometric Fourier series; these calculations illustrate the high efficiency of these methods. Undoubtedly, the proposed method of phantom knots requires further theoretical studies.
