The paper investigates a non-intrusive parallel time integration with multigrid for space-fractional diffusion equations in two spatial dimensions. We firstly obtain a fully discrete scheme via using the linear finite element method to discretize spatial and temporal derivatives to propagate solutions. Next, we present a non-intrusive time-parallelization and its two-level convergence analysis, where we algorithmically and theoretically generalize the MGRIT to time-dependent fine time-grid propagators. Finally, numerical illustrations show that the obtained numerical scheme possesses the saturation error order, theoretical results of the two-level variant deliver good predictions, and significant speedups can be achieved when compared to parareal and the sequential time-stepping approach.
