The present work is the second part of a pair of papers, considering Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin methods with relaxed H(div)-conformity. The first part mainly dealt with presenting a robust analysis with respect to the mesh size h and the introduction of a reconstruction operator to restore divergence-conformity and pressure robustness using a non conforming right hand side. The aim of this part is the presentation of a high order polynomial robust analysis for the relaxed H(\operatorname{div})-conforming Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the two dimensional Stokes problem. It is based on the recently proven polynomial robust LBB-condition for BDM elements [P. L. Lederer, J. Sch\"oberl, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis, 2017] and is derived by a direct approach instead of using a best approximation C\'{e}a like result. We further treat the impact of the reconstruction operator on the hp analysis and present a numerical investigation considering polynomial robustness. We conclude the paper presenting an efficient operator splitting time integration scheme for the Navier--Stokes equations which is based on the methods recently presented in [C. Lehrenfeld, J. Sch\"oberl, \emph{Comp. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng.}, 361 (2016)] and includes the ideas of the reconstruction operator.
