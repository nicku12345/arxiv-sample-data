In this paper, we present an iterative reproducing kernel method for numerical solution of one dimensional fractional Burgers equation with variable coefficient. Convergence analysis is constructed theoretically. Numerical experiments show that approximate solution uniformly converges to exact solution. The results demonstrate that the given method very efficient and convenient for fractional Burgers equation.
