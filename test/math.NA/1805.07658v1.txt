In this paper we deal with the numerical solution of a Hele--Shaw-like system via a cell model with active motion. Convergence of approximations is established for well-posed initial data. These data are chosen in such a way the time derivate is positive at the initial time.   The numerical method is constructed by means of a finite element procedure together with the use of a closed-nodal integration. This gives rise to an algorithm which preserves positivity whenever a right-angled triangulation is considered. As a result, uniform-in-time a priori estimates are proven which allows us to pass to limit towards a solution to the Hele--Shaw problem.
