We develop and analyze an ultraweak variational formulation for a variant of the Kirchhoff-Love plate bending model. Based on this formulation, we introduce a discretization of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin type with optimal test functions (DPG). We prove well-posedness of the ultraweak formulation and quasi-optimal convergence of the DPG scheme. The variational formulation and its analysis require tools that control traces and jumps in H^2 (standard Sobolev space of scalar functions) and H(\mathrm{div\,Div}) (symmetric tensor functions with L_2-components whose twice iterated divergence is in L_2), and their dualities. These tools are developed in two and three spatial dimensions. One specific result concerns localized traces in a dense subspace of H(\mathrm{div\,Div}). They are essential to construct basis functions for an approximation of H(\mathrm{div\,Div}). To illustrate the theory we construct basis functions of the lowest order and perform numerical experiments for a smooth and a singular model solution. They confirm the expected convergence behavior of the DPG method both for uniform and adaptively refined meshes.
