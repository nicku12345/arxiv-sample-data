We introduce a class of explicit exponential Rosenbrock methods for the time integration of large systems of stiff differential equations. Their application with respect to simulation tasks in the field of visual computing is discussed where these time integrators have shown to be very competitive compared to standard techniques. In particular, we address the simulation of elastic and nonelastic deformations as well as collision scenarios focusing on relevant aspects like stability and energy conservation, large stiffnesses, high fidelity and visual accuracy.
