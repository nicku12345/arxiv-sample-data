The algebra structure of the Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences and symbols allows us to quickly compute an asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues and singular values, starting from the study of simpler sequences. For matrices with finite dimensions, such results are in general not possible to obtain, since all the informations are asymptotic on the size, except for normal matrices. We want to show how to justify the behaviour of GLT sequences, reducing them to an equivalent normal form through the approximating classes of sequences identification. Moreover, we formulate a conjecture on the uniqueness of this kind of structure, leading to the maximality of GLT sequences over all algebras of sequences and symbols.
