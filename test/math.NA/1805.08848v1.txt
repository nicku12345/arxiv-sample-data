Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a recently introduced computational approach intended to breach the gap between the Finite Element Analysis and the Computer Aided Design worlds. In this work, we apply it to numerically simulate thermal expansion of oil-free twin screw compressors in operation. High global smoothness of IGA leads to a more accurate representation of the compressor geometry. We utilize standard tri-variate B-splines to parametrize the rotors, while the casing is modeled exactly by using NURBS. We employ the Galerkin version of IGA to solve the thermal expansion problem in the stationary case. The results allow to estimate the contraction of the clearance space between the casing and the rotors. The implementation is based on the open source C++ library G+Smo.
