In this paper, we present a divergence-conforming discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for Stokes eigenvalue problems. We prove a priori error estimates for the eigenvalue and eigenfunction errors and present a robust residual based a posteriori error estimator. The a posteriori error estimator is proven to be reliable and (locally) efficient in a mesh-dependent velocity-pressure norm. We finally present some numerical examples that verify the a priori convergence rates and the reliability and efficiency of the residual based a posteriori error estimator.
