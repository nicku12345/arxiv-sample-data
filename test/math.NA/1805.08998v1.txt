The multiplication of matrices is an important arithmetic operation in computational mathematics. In the context of hierarchical matrices, this operation can be realized by the multiplication of structured block-wise low-rank matrices, resulting in an almost linear cost. However, the computational efficiency of the algorithm is based on a recursive scheme which makes the error analysis quite involved. In this article, we propose a new algorithmic framework for the multiplication of hierarchical matrices. It improves currently known implementations by reducing the multiplication of hierarchical matrices towards finding a suitable low-rank approximation of sums of matrix-products. We propose several compression schemes to address this task. As a consequence, we are able to compute the best-approximation of hierarchical matrix products. A cost analysis shows that, under reasonable assumptions on the low-rank approximation method, the cost of the framework is almost linear with respect to the size of the matrix. Numerical experiments show that the new approach produces indeed the best-approximation of the product of hierarchical matrices for a given tolerance. They also show that the new multiplication can accomplish this task in less computation time than the established multiplication algorithm without error control.
