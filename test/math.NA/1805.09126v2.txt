For discretisations of hyperbolic conservation laws, mimicking properties of operators or solutions at the continuous (differential equation) level discretely has resulted in several successful methods. While well-posedness for nonlinear systems in several space dimensions is an open problem, mimetic properties such as summation-by-parts as discrete analogue of integration-by-parts allow a direct transfer of some results and their proofs, e.g. stability for linear systems.   In this article, discrete analogues of the generalised product and chain rules that apply to functions of bounded variation are considered. It is shown that such analogues hold for certain second order operators but are not possible for higher order approximations. Furthermore, entropy dissipation by second derivatives with varying coefficients is investigated, showing again the far stronger mimetic properties of second order approximations compared to higher order ones.
