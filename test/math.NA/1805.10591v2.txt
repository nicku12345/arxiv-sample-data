The non-conforming linear (P_1) triangular FEM can be viewed as a kind of the discontinuous Galerkin method, and is attractive in both theoretical and practical senses. Since various error constants must be quantitatively evaluated for its accurate a priori and a posteriori error estimates, we derive their theoretical upper bounds and some computational results. In particular, the Babu\check{s}ka-Aziz maximum angle condition is required just as in the case of the conforming P_1 triangle. Some applications and numerical results are also illustrated to see the validity and effectiveness of our analysis.
