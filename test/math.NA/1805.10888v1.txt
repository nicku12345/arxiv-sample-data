In this paper, we present an efficient Particle-In-Cell algorithm for the simulation of the three dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system in the presence of a strong external magnetic field. When the intensity of the magnetic field is sufficiently large and for any time step, the numerical scheme provides formally a consistent approximation of the drift-kinetic model, which corresponds to the asymptotic model. Numerical results show that this new Particle-In-Cell method is efficient and accurate large time steps.
