We show how to compute the \emph{optimal relative backward error} for the numerical solution of the Dahlquist test problem by one-step methods. This is an example of a general approach that uses results from optimal control theory to compute optimal residuals, but elementary methods can also be used here because the problem is so simple. This analysis produces new insight into the numerical solution of stiff problems.
