In this paper, we will study the Bloch transformed rough surface scattering problems, and propose a numerical method based on the Bloch transformed problems. Based on the mathematical theory of the scattering problems from locally perturbed periodic surfaces, the same techniques will be applied to the rough surface scattering problems, and an equivalent coupled family of quasi-periodic scattering problems in one periodic cell will be established. The most important result obtained in this paper is on the finite Fourier series approximation of the Bloch transformed field with respect to the quasi-periodicity parameter. It will be proved that the finite series is exactly the Bloch transformed solution corresponds to truncated rough surfaces. Thus the truncation provides a reasonable approximation, and could be applied to the numerical solutions. Based on the approximation, a numerical method is proposed for the rough surface scattering problems. The convergence of the numerical method is proved and illustrated by the numerical experiments. The method provides a completely new perspective for the rough surface scattering problems. There is possibility that some high order method will be developed based on this new method.
