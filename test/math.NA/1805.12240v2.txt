We propose a three dimensional Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin Maxwell approach for modeling Raman gain in fiber laser amplifiers. In contrast with popular beam propagation models, we are interested in a truly full vectorial approach. We apply the ultraweak DPG formulation, which is known to carry desirable properties for high-frequency wave propagation problems, to the coupled Maxwell signal/pump system and use a nonlinear iterative scheme to account for the Raman gain. This paper also introduces a novel and practical full-vectorial formulation of the electric polarization term for Raman gain that emphasizes the fact that the computer modeler is only given a measured bulk Raman gain coefficient. Our results provide promising qualitative corroboration of the model and methodology used.
