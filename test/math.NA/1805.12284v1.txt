In this paper, the coupled fractional Ginzburg-Landau equations are first time investigated numerically. A linearized implicit finite difference scheme is proposed. The scheme involves three time levels, is unconditionally stable and second-order accurate in both time and space variables. The unique solvability, the unconditional stability and optimal pointwise error estimates are obtained by using the energy method and mathematical induction. Moreover, the proposed second-order method can be easily extended into the fourth-order method by using an average finite difference operator for spatial fractional derivatives and Richardson extrapolation for time variable. Finally, numerical results are presented to confirm the theoretical results.
