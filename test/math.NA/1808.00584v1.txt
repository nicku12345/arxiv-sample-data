Fractional Laplace equations are becoming important tools for mathematical modeling and prediction. Recent years have shown much progress in developing accurate and robust algorithms to numerically solve such problems, yet most solvers for fractional problems are computationally expensive. Practitioners are often interested in choosing the fractional exponent of the mathematical model to match experimental and/or observational data; this requires the computational solution to the fractional equation for several values of the both exponent and other parameters that enter the model, which is a computationally expensive many-query problem. To address this difficulty, we present a model order reduction strategy for fractional Laplace problems utilizing the reduced basis method (RBM). Our RBM algorithm for this fractional partial differential equation (PDE) allows us to accomplish significant acceleration compared to a traditional PDE solver while maintaining accuracy. Our numerical results demonstrate this accuracy and efficiency of our RBM algorithm on fractional Laplace problems in two spatial dimensions.
