In this paper we study upper and lower bounds on the Bregman divergence \Delta_{\mathcal{F}}^{\xi}(y,x):=\mathcal{F}(y)-\mathcal{F}(x)-\langle \xi, y-x\rangle  for some convex functional \mathcal{F} on a normed space \mathcal{X}, with subgradient \xi\in\partial\mathcal{F}(x). We give a considerably simpler new proof of the inequalities by Xu and Roach for the special case \mathcal{F}(x)=\left\| x\right\|^p, p>1. The results can be transfered to more general functions as well.
