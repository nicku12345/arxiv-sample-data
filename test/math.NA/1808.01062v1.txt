In real applications, the construction of prior and acceleration of sampling for posterior are usually two key points of Bayesian inversion algorithm for engineers. In this paper, q-analogy of Gaussian distribution, q-Gaussian distribution, is introduced as the prior of inverse problems. And an acceleration algorithm based on spectral likelihood approximation is discussed. We mainly focus on the convergence of the posterior distribution in the sense of Kullback-Leibler divergence when approximated likelihood function and truncated prior distribution are used. Moreover, the convergence in the sense of total variation and Hellinger metric is obtained. In the end two numerical examples are displayed.
