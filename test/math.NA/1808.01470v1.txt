This note is devoted to discussing multivariate approximation of continuous functions on [0,1]^d with analytic Korobov kernels in the worst and average case settings. We only consider algorithms that use finitely many evaluations of arbitrary continuous linear functionals. We study EC-(s, t)-weak tractability under the absolute or normalized error criterion, and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for 0<\min(s,t)<1 and \max(s,t)\le 1 in the worst case setting and for s,t>0 in the average case setting.
