In this paper, we present continuous-stage partitioned Runge-Kutta (csPRK) methods for energy-preserving integration of Hamiltonian systems. A sufficient condition for the energy preservation of the csPRK methods is derived. It is shown that the presented condition contains the existing condition for energy-preserving continuous-stage Runge-Kutta methods as a special case. A noticeable and interesting result is that when we use the simplifying assumptions of order conditions and the normalized shifted Legendre polynomials for constructing high-order energy-preserving csPRK methods, both the Butcher "weight" coefficients B_\tau and \widehat{B}_\tau must be equal to 1. As illustrative examples, new energy-preserving integrators are acquired by virtue of the presented condition, and for the sake of verifying our theoretical results, some numerical experiments are reported.
