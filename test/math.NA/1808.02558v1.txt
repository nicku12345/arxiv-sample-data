In the last two decades, increased need for high-fidelity simulations of the time evolution and propagation of forces in granular media has spurred renewed interest in discrete element method (DEM) modeling of frictional contact. Force penalty methods, while economic and accessible, introduce artificial stiffness, requiring small time steps to retain numerical stability. Optimization-based methods, which enforce contacts geometrically through complementarity constraints, allow the use of larger time steps at the expense of solving a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) each time step. We review the latest efforts to produce solvers for this NCP, focusing on its relaxation to a cone complementarity problem (CCP) and solution via an equivalent quadratic optimization problem with conic constraints. We distinguish between linearly convergent first order methods and second order methods, which gain quadratic convergence and more robust performance at the expense of the solution of large sparse linear systems.   We propose a novel acceleration for the solution of Newton step linear systems in second order methods using low-rank compression based fast direct solvers. We use the Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) decomposition to produce efficient approximate representations of the system matrix and its inverse. This provides a robust framework to accelerate its solution in a direct or a preconditioned iterative method. In a number of numerical tests, we demonstrate that this approach displays sublinear scaling of precomputation costs, may be efficiently updated across Newton iterations as well as across time steps, and leads to a fast, optimal complexity solution of the Newton step. This allows our method to gain an order of magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art preconditioning techniques for moderate to large-scale systems, mitigating the computational bottleneck of second order methods.
