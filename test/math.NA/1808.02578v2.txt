A critical challenge in the data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is producing methods robust to measurement error, particularly when data is limited. Many leading methods either rely on denoising prior to learning or on access to large volumes of data to average over the effect of noise. We propose a novel paradigm for data-driven modeling that simultaneously learns the dynamics and estimates the measurement noise at each observation. By constraining our learning algorithm, our method explicitly accounts for measurement error in the map between observations, treating both the measurement error and the dynamics as unknowns to be identified, rather than assuming idealized noiseless trajectories. We model the unknown vector field using a deep neural network, imposing a Runge-Kutta integrator structure to isolate this vector field, even when the data has a non-uniform timestep, thus constraining and focusing the modeling effort. We demonstrate the ability of this framework to form predictive models on a variety of canonical test problems of increasing complexity and show that it is robust to substantial amounts of measurement error. We also discuss issues with the generalizability of neural network models for dynamical systems and provide open-source code for all examples.
