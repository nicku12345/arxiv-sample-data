In this paper, we apply randomized algorithms to approximate the total least squares (TLS) solution of the problem Ax\approx b in the large-scale discrete ill-posed problems. A regularization technique, based on the multiplicative randomization and the subspace iteration, is proposed to obtain the approximate core problem.In the error analysis, we provide upper bounds %in terms of the (k\!\!+\!\!1)-th singular value of A for the errors of the solution and the residual of the randomized core reduction. Illustrative numerical examples and comparisons are presented.
