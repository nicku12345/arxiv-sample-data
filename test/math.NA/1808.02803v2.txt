In recent years, a lot of research was devoted to Simpson's rule for numerical integration. In the paper we study a natural successor of Simpson's rule, namely the Boole's rule. It is the Newton-Cotes formula in the case where the interval of integration is divided into four subintervals of equal length. With computer software assistance, we prove novel error bounds for Boole's rule.
