In this paper we give an elementary proof of the convergence of corner cutting algorithms refining points, in case the corner cutting weights are taken from the rather general class of weights considered by Gregory and Qu (1996). We then use similar ideas, adapted to nets of functions, to prove the convergence of corner cutting algorithms refining nets of functions, in case the corner cutting weights are taken from a stricter class of weights than in the refinement of points.
