In the paper "A Chaotic Search for i"~(\cite{strang1991chaotic}), Strang completely explained the behaviour of Newton's method when using real initial guesses on f(x) = x^{2}+1, which has only a pair of complex roots \pm i. He explored an exact symbolic formula for the iteration, namely x_{n}=\cot{ \left( 2^{n} \theta_{0} \right) }, which is valid in exact arithmetic. In this paper, we extend this to to k^{th} order Householder methods, which include Halley's method, and to the secant method. Two formulae, x_{n}=\cot{ \left( \theta_{n-1}+\theta_{n-2} \right) } with \theta_{n-1}=\mathrm{arccot}{\left(x_{n-1}\right)} and \theta_{n-2}=\mathrm{arccot}{\left(x_{n-2}\right)}, and x_{n}=\cot{ \left( (k+1)^{n} \theta_{0} \right) } with \theta_{0} = \mathrm{arccot}(x_{0}), are provided. The asymptotic behaviour and periodic character are illustrated by experimental computation. We show that other methods (Schr\"{o}der iterations of the first kind) are generally not so simple. We also explain an old method that can be used to allow Maple's \textsl{Fractals[Newton]} package to visualize general one-step iterations by disguising them as Newton iterations.
