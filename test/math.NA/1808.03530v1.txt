We investigate the uniform approximation provided by least squares polynomials on the unit Euclidean sphere \mathbb{S}^q in \mathbb{R}^{q+1}, with q\ge 2. Like any other polynomial projection, the study concerns the growth, as the degree n tends to infinity, of the associated Lebesgue constant, i.e., of the uniform norm of the least squares operator. If the least squares polynomial of degree n is based on a set of points, which are nodes of a positive weighted quadrature rule of degree of exactness 2n, then we state two different sufficient conditions for having an optimal Lebesgue constant that increases with n at the minimal projections order. Hence, under our assumptions least squares and hyperinterpolation polynomials provide a comparable approximation with respect to the uniform norm.
