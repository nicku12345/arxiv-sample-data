In this paper we compare approximation properties of degree p spline spaces with different numbers of continuous derivatives. We prove that, for a given space dimension, \smooth {p-1} splines provide better a priori error bounds for the approximation of functions in H^{p+1}(0,1). Our result holds for all practically interesting cases when comparing \smooth {p-1} splines with \smooth {-1} (discontinuous) splines. When comparing \smooth {p-1} splines with \smooth 0 splines our proof covers almost all cases for p\ge 3, but we can not conclude anything for p=2. The results are generalized to the approximation of functions in H^{q+1}(0,1) for q<p, to broken Sobolev spaces and to tensor product spaces.
