We introduce new efficient integral representations and methods for evaluation of pdfs, cpds and quantiles of stable distributions. For wide regions in the parameter space, absolute errors of order 10^{-15} can be achieved in 0.005-0.1 msec (Matlab implementation), even when the index of the distribution is small or close to 1. For the calculation of quantiles in wide regions in the tails using the Newton or bisection method, it suffices to precompute several hundred values of the characteristic exponent at points of an appropriate grid (conformal principal components) and use these values in formulas for cpdf and pdf, which require a fairly small number of elementary operations. The methods of the paper are applicable to other classes of integrals, especially highly oscillatory ones, and are typically faster than the popular methods.
