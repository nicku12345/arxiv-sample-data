We find new discrete H^1- and Poincar\'e-Friedrichs inequalities by studying the invertibility of the DG approximation of the flux for local spaces admitting M-decompositions. We then show how to use these inequalities to define and analyze new, superconvergent HDG and mixed methods for which the stabilization function is defined in such a way that the approximations satisfy new H^1-stability results with which their error analysis is greatly simplified. We apply this approach to define a wide class of energy-bounded, superconvergent HDG and mixed methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations defined on unstructured meshes using, in 2D, general polygonal elements and, in 3D, general, flat-faced tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal and hexahedral elements.
