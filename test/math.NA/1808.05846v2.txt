Solving the radiation transport equation is a challenging task, due to the high dimensionality of the solution's phase space. The commonly used discrete ordinates (S_N) method suffers from ray effects which result from a break in rotational symmetry from the finite set of directions chosen by S_N. The spherical harmonics (P_N) equations, on the other hand, preserve rotational symmetry, but can produce negative particle densities. The discrete ordinates (S_N) method, in turn, by construction ensures non-negative particle densities.   In this paper we present a modified version of the S_N method, the rotated S_N (rS_N) method. Compared to S_N, we add a rotation and interpolation step for the angular quadrature points and the respective function values after every time step. Thereby, the number of directions on which the solution evolves is effectively increased and ray effects are mitigated. Solution values on rotated ordinates are computed by an interpolation step. Implementation details are provided and in our experiments the rotation/interpolation step only adds 5% to 10% to the runtime of the S_N method. We apply the rS_N method to the line-source and a lattice test case, both being prone to ray-effects. Ray effects are reduced significantly, even for small numbers of quadrature points. The rS_N method yields qualitatively similar solutions to the S_N method with less than a third of the number of quadrature points, both for the line-source and the lattice problem.
