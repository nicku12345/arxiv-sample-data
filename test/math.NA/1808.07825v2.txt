Extending the wavenumber-explicit analysis of [Chen & Qiu, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 309 (2017)], we analyze the L^2-convergence of a least squares method for the Helmholtz equation with wavenumber k. For domains with an analytic boundary, we obtain improved rates in the mesh size h and the polynomial degree p under the scale resolution condition that hk/p is sufficiently small and p/\log k is sufficiently large.
