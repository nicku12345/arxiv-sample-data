We revisit the energy space based Dirichlet boundary control problem governed by biharmonic equation investigated in \cite{CHOWDHURYDGcontrol2015}. The L_{2} norm estimate in \cite{CHOWDHURYDGcontrol2015} is derived under an extra regularity assumption on the optimal control which is guaranteed if the interior angles of the domain are less than 120^{o}, which is quite restrictive in nature. In this paper we have extended this interior angle condition upto 180^{o} i.\;e. now this analysis applies to any convex domain. Additionally, we propose a new approach for deriving error estimates for Cahn-Hilliard equation of elliptic type under minimal regularity assumption, for C^{0} interior penalty method.
