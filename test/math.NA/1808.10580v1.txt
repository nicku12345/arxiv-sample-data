We consider the inverse problem of estimating parameters of a driven diffusion (e.g., the underlying fluid flow, diffusion coefficient, or source terms) from point measurements of a passive scalar (e.g., the concentration of a pollutant). We present two particle methods that leverage the structure of the inverse problem to enable efficient computation of the forward map, one for time evolution problems and one for a Dirichlet boundary-value problem. The methods scale in a natural fashion to modern computational architectures, enabling substantial speedup for applications involving sparse observations and high-dimensional unknowns. Numerical examples of applications to Bayesian inference and numerical optimization are provided.
