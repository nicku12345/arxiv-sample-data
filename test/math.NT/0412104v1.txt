We give examples of Shimura correspondence for rational modular forms f of weight 2 and level p^2, for primes p<=19, computed as an application of a method we introduced in \cite{Pacetti-Tornaria}. Furthermore, we verify in this examples a conjectural formula for the central values L(f,-pd,1) and, in case p = 3 (mod 4), a formula for the central values L(f,d,1) corresponding to the real quadratic twists of f.
