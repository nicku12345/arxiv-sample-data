We study the existence of equilateral triangles of given side lengths and with integer coordinates in dimension three. We show that such a triangle exists if and only if their side lengths are of the form \sqrt{2(m^2-mn+n^2)} for some integers m,n. We also show a similar characterization for the sides of a regular tetrahedron in \Z^3: such a tetrahedron exists if and only if the sides are of the form k\sqrt{2}, for some k\in\N. The classification of all the equilateral triangles in \Z^3 contained in a given plane is studied and the beginning analysis is presented. A more general parametrization is proven under a special assumption. Some related questions are stated in the end.
