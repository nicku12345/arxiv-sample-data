This paper contains a loose collection of remarks on F1-schemes. Etale morphisms and universal coverings are introduced. The relation to toric varieties, at least for integral schemes, is clarified.In this paper it is shown that integral F1-schemes of finite type are essentially the same as toric varieties. A description of the F1-zeta function in terms of toric geometry is given. Etale morphisms and universal coverings are introduced.
