Let q\in(1,2); it is known that each x\in[0,1/(q-1)] has an expansion of the form x=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nq^{-n} with a_n\in\{0,1\}. It was shown in \cite{EJK} that if q<(\sqrt5+1)/2, then each x\in(0,1/(q-1)) has a continuum of such expansions; however, if q>(\sqrt5+1)/2, then there exist infinitely many x having a unique expansion \cite{GS}.   In the present paper we begin the study of parameters q for which there exists x having a fixed finite number m>1 of expansions in base q. In particular, we show that if q<q_2=1.71..., then each x has either 1 or infinitely many expansions, i.e., there are no such q in ((\sqrt5+1)/2,q_2).   On the other hand, for each m>1 there exists \ga_m>0 such that for any q\in(2-\ga_m,2), there exists x which has exactly m expansions in base q.
