The multplicative order of an integer g modulo a prime p, with p coprime to g, is defined to be the smallest positive integer k such that g^k is congruent to 1 modulo p. For fixed integers g and d the distribution of this order over residue classes mod d is considered as p runs over the primes.   An overview is given of the most significant of my results on this problem obtained (mainly) in the three part series of papers `On the distribution of the order and index of g (modulo p) over residue classes' I-III (appeared in the Journal of Number Theory, also available from the ArXiv).
