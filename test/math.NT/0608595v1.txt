For a prime p, we consider Kloosterman sums  K_{p}(a) = \sum_{x\in \F_p^*} \exp(2 \pi i (x + ax^{-1})/p), \qquad a \in \F_p^*,  over a finite field of p elements. It is well known that due to results of Deligne, Katz and Sarnak, the distribution of the sums K_{p}(a) when a runs through \F_p^* is in accordance with the Sato--Tate conjecture. Here we show that the same holds where a runs through the sums a = u+v for u \in \cU, v \in \cV for any two sufficiently large sets \cU, \cV \subseteq \F_p^*.   We also improve a recent bound on the nonlinearity of a Boolean function associated with the sequence of signs of Kloosterman sums.
