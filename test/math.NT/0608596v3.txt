We show that, for sufficiently large integers m and X, for almost all a =1, ..., m the ratios a/x and the products ax, where |x|\le X, are very uniformly distributed in the residue ring modulo m. This extends some recent results of Garaev and Karatsuba. We apply this result to show that on average over r and s, ranging over relatively short intervals, the distribution of Kloosterman sums  K_{r,s}(p) = \sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \exp(2 \pi i (rn + sn^{-1})/p),  for primes p\le T is in accordance with the Sato--Tate conjecture.
