We connect and generalize Matiyasevich's identity #0102 with Bernoulli numbers and an identity of Candelpergher, Coppo and Delabaere on Ramanujan summation of the divergent series of the infinite sum of the harmonic numbers. The formulae are analytic continuation of Euler sums and lead to new recursion relations for derivatives of Bernoulli numbers. The techniques used are contour integration, generating functions and divergent series.
