We give a shorter simpler proof of a result of Szalay on the equation 2^a + 2^b + 1 = x^2. We give an elementary proof of a result of Luca on the equation of the title for prime p > 2. The elementary treatment is made possible by a lemma which is also used to obtain a bound on n in the equation x^2 + C = y^n, where x and y are primes or prime powers, and 2 | C; the bound depends only on the primes dividing C.
