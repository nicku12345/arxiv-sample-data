We construct (generalized) logarithmic derivatives for general n-dimensional local fields K of mixed characteristics (0,p) in which p is not necessarily a prime element with residue field k such that [k:k^p]=p^{n-1}. For the construction of the logarithmic derivative map, we define n-dimensional rings of overconvergent series and show that - as in the 1-dimensional case - they can be interpreted as functions converging on some annulus of the open unit p-adic disc. Using the generalized logarithmic derivative, we give a new construction of Kato's n-dimensional dual exponential map.
