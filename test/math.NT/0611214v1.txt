This note contains an attempt to relate Hecke's presentation of an ideal class zeta function in a real quadratic field as an integral of the nonholomorphic Eisenstein series along the loop on modular curve and Zagier's decomposition of this zeta function into the sum of zeta functions of indefinite quadratic forms. (See D.Zagier, A Kronecker limit formula for real quadratic field.) It is a preliminary version.
