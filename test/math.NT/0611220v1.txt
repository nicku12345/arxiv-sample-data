Let \Lb be a lattice in a Euclidean space E, with kissing number s and perfection rank r, that is, the rank in \End^{\text{sym}}(E) of the set of orthogonal projections to minimal vectors of \Lb. This defines a space of \emph{perfection relations}, of dimension s-r. We focus on ``short relations'', in connection with the index theory, previously developed by Watson, Ry\v{s}kov, Zahareva and the second author in [W], [R], [Z] and [M1].
