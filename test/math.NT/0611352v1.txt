Let \Theta=(\alpha,\beta) be a point in \bR^2, with 1,\alpha,\beta linearly independent over \bQ. We attach to \Theta a quadruple \Omega(\Theta) of exponents which measure the quality of approximation to \Theta both by rational points and by rational lines. The two ``uniform'' components of \Omega(\Theta) are related by an equation, due to Jarn{\'\i}k, and the four exponents satisfy two inequalities which refine Khintchine's transference principle. Conversely, we show that for any quadruple \Omega fulfilling these necessary conditions, there exists a point \Theta\in \bR^2 for which \Omega(\Theta) =\Omega.
