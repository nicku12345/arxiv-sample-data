Let \pi=\otimes\pi_{v} and \pi^{\prime}=\otimes\pi_{v}^{\prime} be two irreducible, automorphic, cuspidal representations of GL_{m}(\mathbb{A}_{K}) >. Using the logarithmic zero-free region of Rankin-Selberg L-function, Moreno established the analytic strong multiplicity one theorem if at least one of them is self-contragredient, i.e. \pi and \pi^{\prime} will be equal if they have finitely many same local components \pi_{v},\pi_{v}^{\prime}, for which the norm of places are bounded polynomially by the analytic conductor of these cuspidal representations. Without the assumption of the self-contragredient for \pi,\pi^{\prime}, Brumley generalized this theorem by a a different method, which can be seen as an invariant of Rankin-Selberg method. In this paper, influenced by Landau's smooth method of Perron formula, we improved the degree of Brumley's polynomial bound to be 4m+\epsilon.
