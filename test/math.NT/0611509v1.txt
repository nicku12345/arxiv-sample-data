Let phi denote Euler's phi function. For a fixed odd prime we give an asymptotic series expansion in the sense of Poincare for the number E_q(x) of n<=x such that q does not divide phi(n). Thereby we improve on a recent theorem of B.K. Spearman and K.S. Williams [Ark. Mat. 44 (2006), 166-181]. Furthermore we resolve, under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, which of two approximations to E_q(x) is asymptotically superior using recent results of Y. Ihara on the Euler-Kronecker constant of a number field.
