In [B-G1] and [B-G2], Borisov and Gunnells constructed for each level (N > 1) and for each weight (k > 1) a modular symbol with values in Sk(\Gamma_1(N)) using products of Eisenstein series. In this paper we generalize this result by producing a modular symbol (for GL2(Q)!!!) with values in locally constant distributions on M2(Q) taking values in the space of cuspidal power series in two variables (see Definition 5). We can recover the above cited result by restricting to a principal open invariant for the action of \Gamma_1(N) and to the homogeneous degree k-2 part of the power series. We should also mention that Colmez [Col] constructs similar distributions (zEis(k; j)). The modification in the definition of such distributions allow us to observe further relations among these distributions (Manin Relations) which in turn makes possible the existence of our construction. In the last section we exhibit some instances of these relations for the full modular group.
