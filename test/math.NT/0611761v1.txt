Under Cram\'er's conjecture concerning the prime numbers, we prove that for any x>1, there exists a real A=A(x)>1 for which the formula [A^{n^x}] (where [] denotes the integer part) gives a prime number for any positive integer n. Under the same conjecture, we also prove that for any \epsilon>0, there exists a positive real number B for which the formula [B.{n!}^{2+\epsilon}] gives a prime number for any sufficiently large positive integer n.
