Using non-archimedean q-integrals on Zp defined in [15, 16], we define a new Changhee q-Euler polynomials and numbers which are different from those of Kim [7] and Carlitz [2]. We define generating functions of multiple q-Euler numbers and polynomials. Furthermore we construct multivariate Hurwitz type zeta function which interpolates the multivariate q-Euler numbers or polynomials at negative integers.
