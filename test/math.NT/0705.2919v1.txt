We study arithmetic progression in the x-coordinate of rational points on genus two curves. As we know, there are two models for the curve C of genus two: C: y^2=f_{5}(x) or C: y^2=f_{6}(x), where f_{5}, f_{6}\in\Q[x], \operatorname{deg}f_{5}=5, \operatorname{deg}f_{6}=6 and the polynomials f_{5}, f_{6} do not have multiple roots. First we prove that there exists an infinite family of curves of the form y^2=f(x), where f\in\Q[x] and \operatorname{deg}f=5 each containing 11 points in arithmetic progression. We also present an example of F\in\Q[x] with \operatorname{deg}F=5 such that on the curve y^2=F(x) twelve points lie in arithmetic progression. Next, we show that there exist infinitely many curves of the form y^2=g(x) where g\in\Q[x] and \operatorname{deg}g=6, each containing 16 points in arithmetic progression. Moreover, we present two examples of curves in this form with 18 points in arithmetic progression.
