Let \mathcal{E}_{f}:y^2=x^3+f(t)x, where f\in\Q[t]\setminus\Q, and let us assume that \op{deg}f\leq 4. In this paper we prove that if \op{deg}f\leq 3, then there exists a rational base change t\mapsto\phi(t) such that on the surface \cal{E}_{f\circ\phi} there is a non-torsion section. A similar theorem is valid in case when \op{deg}f=4 and there exists t_{0}\in\Q such that infinitely many rational points lie on the curve E_{t_{0}}:y^2=x^3+f(t_{0})x. In particular, we prove that if \op{deg}f=4 and f is not an even polynomial, then there is a rational point on \cal{E}_{f}. Next, we consider a surface \cal{E}^{g}:y^2=x^3+g(t), where g\in\Q[t] is a monic polynomial of degree six. We prove that if the polynomial g is not even, there is a rational base change t\mapsto\psi(t) such that on the surface \cal{E}^{g\circ\psi} there is a non-torsion section. Furthermore, if there exists t_{0}\in\Q such that on the curve E^{t_{0}}:y^2=x^3+g(t_{0}) there are infinitely many rational points, then the set of these t_{0} is infinite. We also present some results concerning diophantine equation of the form x^2-y^3-g(z)=t, where t is a variable.
