We prove the Tate duality for higher dimensional local fields of mixed characteristic (0,p), when p is an odd prime, using the theory of higher fields of norms. Assuming that p is not ramified in the basefield, we then use this construction to define the higher Hilbert pairing. In particular, we show that the Hilbert pairing is non-degenerate, and we re-discover the formulae of Brueckner and Vostokov.
