The main goal of this paper is to prove a formula that expresses the limit behaviour of Dedekind zeta functions for \Re s > 1/2 in families of number fields, assuming that the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis holds. This result can be viewed as a generalization of the Brauer--Siegel theorem. As an application we obtain a limit formula for Euler--Kronecker constants in families of number fields.
