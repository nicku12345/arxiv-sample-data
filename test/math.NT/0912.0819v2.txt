Given F a real abelian field, p an odd prime and \chi any Dirichlet character of F we give a method for computing the \chi-index \displaystyle (H^1(G_S,\mathbb{Z}_p(r))^\chi: C^F(r)^\chi) where the Tate twist r is an odd integer r\geq 3, the group C^F(r) is the group of higher circular units, G_S is the Galois group over F of the maximal S ramified algebraic extension of F, and S is the set of places of F dividing p. This \chi-index can now be computed in terms only of elementary arithmetic of finite fields \FM_\ell. Our work generalizes previous results by Kurihara who used the assumption that the order of \chi divides p-1.
