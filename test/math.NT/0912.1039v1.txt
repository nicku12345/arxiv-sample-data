This paper continues investigations on the integral transforms of the Minkowski question mark function. In this work we finally establish the long-sought formula for the moments, which does not explicitly involve regular continued fractions, though it has a hidden nice interpretation in terms of semi-regular continued fractions. The proof is self-contained and does not rely on previous results by the author.
