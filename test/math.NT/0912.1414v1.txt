Recently, the explicit evaluation of Gauss sums in the index 2 and 4 cases have been given in several papers (see [2,3,7,8]). In the course of evaluation, the sigh (or unit root) ambiguities are unavoidably occurred. This paper presents another method, different from [7] and [8], to determine the sigh (unit root) ambiguities of Gauss sums in the index 2 case, as well as the ones with odd order in the non-cyclic index 4 case. And we note that the method in this paper are more succinct and effective than [8] and [7].
