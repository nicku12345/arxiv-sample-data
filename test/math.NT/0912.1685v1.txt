Let \mathbb{F}_q be a finite field with q elements, \psi a non-zero element of \mathbb{F}_q, and n an integer \geq 3 prime to q. The aim of this article is to show that the zeta function of the projective variety over \mathbb{F}_q defined by X_\psi \colon x_1^n+...+x_n^n - n \psi x_1... x_n=0 has, when n is prime and X_\psi is non singular (i.e. when \psi^n \neq 1), an explicit decomposition in factors coming from affine varieties of odd dimension \leq n-4 which are of hypergeometric type. The method we use consists in counting separately the number of points of X_\psi and of some varieties of the preceding type and then compare them. This article answers, at least when n is prime, a question asked by D. Wan in his article "Mirror Symmetry for Zeta Functions".
