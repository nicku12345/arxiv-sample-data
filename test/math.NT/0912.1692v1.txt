We consider cuspidal representations in spaces of automorphic forms for the congruence subgroup \Gamma_0(I) of Hilbert modular groups for some number field F. To each such representation are associated the eigenvalue \lambda_j of the Casimir operator at each real place j of F, and the number \ld_{\mathfrak p} parametrizing the eigenvalue of the Hecke operator T_{\mathfrak p^2} at each finite place \mathfrak p outside the ideal I. We study the joint distribution of the \lambda_j for all real places j, and the \ld_{\mathfrak p} for finitely many \mathfrak p outside I, over the cuspidal representations. This distribution is given by the product of the Plancherel measure at each real place and the Sato-Tate measure at each finite place.
