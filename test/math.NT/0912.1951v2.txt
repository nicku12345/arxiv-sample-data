We prove that the sum of multiple zeta-star values over all indices inserted two 2's into the string (\underbrace{3,1, ..., 3,1}_{2n}) is evaluated to a rational multiple of powers of \pi^2. We also establish certain conjectures on evaluations of multiple zeta-star values observed by numerical experiments.
