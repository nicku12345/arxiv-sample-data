For an abelian totally real number field F and an odd prime number p which splits totally in F, we present a functorial approach to special "p-units" previously built by D. Solomon using "wild" Euler systems. This allows us to prove a conjecture of Solomon on the annihilation of the p-class group of F (in the particular context here), as well as related annihilation results and index formulae.
