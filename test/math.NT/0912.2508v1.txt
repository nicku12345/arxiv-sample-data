In this paper, we prove the following result: {quote} Let \A be an infinite set of positive integers. For all positive integer n, let \tau_n denote the smallest element of \A which does not divide n. Then we have \lim_{N \to + \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 1}^{N} \tau_n = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\lcm\{a \in \A | a \leq n\}} .{quote} In the two particular cases when \A is the set of all positive integers and when \A is the set of the prime numbers, we give a more precise result for the average asymptotic behavior of {(\tau_n)}_n. Furthermore, we discuss the irrationality of the limit of \tau_n (in the average sense) by applying a result of Erd\H{o}s.
