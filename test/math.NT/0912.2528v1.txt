Iwasawa's classical asymptotical formula relates the orders of the p-parts X_n of the ideal class groups along a \ZM_p-extension F_\infty/F of a number field F, to Iwasawa structural invariants \la and \mu attached to the inverse limit X_\infty=\limpro X_n. It relies on "good" descent properties satisfied by X_n. If F is abelian and F_\infty is cyclotomic it is known that the p-parts of the orders of the global units modulo circular units U_n/C_n are asymptotically equivalent to the p-parts of the ideal class numbers. This suggests that these quotients U_n/C_n, so to speak unit class groups, satisfy also good descent properties. We show this directly, i.e. without using Iwasawa's Main Conjecture.
