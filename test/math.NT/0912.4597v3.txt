In this paper, we study representations of real numbers in the positional numeration system with negative basis, as introduced by Ito and Sadahiro. We focus on the set \Z_{-\beta} of numbers whose representation uses only non-negative powers of -\beta, the so-called (-\beta)-integers. We describe the distances between consecutive elements of \Z_{-\beta}. In case that this set is non-trivial we associate to \beta an infinite word \boldsymbol{v}_{-\beta} over an (in general infinite) alphabet. The self-similarity of \Z_{-\beta}, i.e., the property -\beta \Z_{-\beta}\subset \Z_{-\beta}, allows us to find a morphism under which \boldsymbol{v}_{-\beta} is invariant. On the example of two cubic irrational bases \beta we demonstrate the difference between Rauzy fractals generated by (-\beta)-integers and by \beta-integers.
