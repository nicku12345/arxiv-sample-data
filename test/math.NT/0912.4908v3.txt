Chebyshev was the first to observe a bias in the distribution of primes in residue classes. The general phenomenon is that if a is a nonsquare\mod q and b is a square\mod q, then there tend to be more primes congruent to a\mod q than b\mod q in initial intervals of the positive integers; more succinctly, there is a tendency for \pi(x;q,a) to exceed \pi(x;q,b). Rubinstein and Sarnak defined \delta(q;a,b) to be the logarithmic density of the set of positive real numbers x for which this inequality holds; intuitively, \delta(q;a,b) is the "probability" that \pi(x;q,a) > \pi(x;q,b) when x is "chosen randomly". In this paper, we establish an asymptotic series for \delta(q;a,b) that can be instantiated with an error term smaller than any negative power of q. This asymptotic formula is written in terms of a variance V(q;a,b) that is originally defined as an infinite sum over all nontrivial zeros of Dirichlet L-functions corresponding to characters\mod q; we show how V(q;a,b) can be evaluated exactly as a finite expression. In addition to providing the exact rate at which \delta(q;a,b) converges to \frac12 as q grows, these evaluations allow us to compare the various density values \delta(q;a,b) as a and b vary modulo q; by analyzing the resulting formulas, we can explain and predict which of these densities will be larger or smaller, based on arithmetic properties of the residue classes a and b\mod q. For example, we show that if a is a prime power and a' is not, then \delta(q;a,1) < \delta(q;a',1) for all but finitely many moduli q for which both a and a' are nonsquares. Finally, we establish rigorous numerical bounds for these densities \delta(q;a,b) and report on extensive calculations of them.
