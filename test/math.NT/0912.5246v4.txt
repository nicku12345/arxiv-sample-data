We obtain nontrivial estimates of quadratic character sums of division polynomials \Psi_n(P), n=1,2, ..., evaluated at a given point P on an elliptic curve over a finite field of q elements. Our bounds are nontrivial if the order of P is at least q^{1/2 + \epsilon} for some fixed \epsilon > 0. This work is motivated by an open question about statistical indistinguishability of some cryptographically relevant sequences which has recently been brought up by K. Lauter and the second author.
