We propose some primality tests for 2^kn-1, where k, n in Z, k>= 2 and n odd. There are several tests depending on how big n is. These tests are proved using properties of elliptic curves. Essentially, the new primality tests are the elliptic curve version of the Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel primality test. Note:An anonymous referee suggested that Benedict H. Gross already proved the same result about a primality test for Mersenne primes using elliptic curve.
