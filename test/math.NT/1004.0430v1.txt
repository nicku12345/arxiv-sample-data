This paper answers a question asked by Ed Pegg Jr. in 2001: "What is the maximal value of min(A,B,C)/ gcd(A,B,C) for A^x + B^y = C^z with A,B,C >= 1; x,y,z >= 3?" Equations of this form are analyzed, showing how they map to exponential Diophantine equations with coprime bases. A search algorithm is provided to find the largest min/gcd value within a given equation range. The algorithm precalculates a multi-gigabyte lookup table of power residue information that is used to eliminate over 99% of inputs with a single array lookup and without any further calculations. On inputs that pass this test, the algorithm then performs further power residue tests, avoiding modular powering by using lookups into precalculated tables, and avoiding division by using multiplicative inverses. This algorithm is used to show the largest min/gcd value for all equations with C^z <= 2^100.
