Hardy and Littlewood conjectured that every large integer n that is not a square is the sum of a prime and a square. They believed that the number \mathcal{R}(n) of such representations for n = p+m^2 is asymptotically given by \mathcal{R}(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log n}\prod_{p=3}^{\infty}(1-\frac{1}{p-1}(\frac{n}{p})), where p is a prime, m is an integer, and (\frac{n}{p}) denotes the Legendre symbol. Unfortunately, as we will later point out, this conjecture is difficult to prove and not \emph{all} integers that are nonsquares can be represented as the sum of a prime and a square. Instead in this paper we prove two upper bounds for \mathcal{R}(n) for n \le N. The first upper bound applies to \emph{all} n \le N. The second upper bound depends on the possible existence of the Siegel zero, and assumes its existence, and applies to all N/2 < n \le N but at most \ll N^{1-\delta_1} of these integers, where N is a sufficiently large positive integer and 0< \delta_1 \le 0.000025.
