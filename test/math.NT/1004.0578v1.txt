In 2007, A.I.Aptekarev and his collaborators discovered a sequence of rational approximations to Euler's constant \gamma defined by a linear recurrence. In this paper, we generalize this result and present an explicit construction of rational approximations for the numbers \ln(b)-\psi(a+1), a, b\in {\mathbb Q}, b>0, a>-1, where \psi defines the logarithmic derivative of the Euler gamma function. We prove exact formulas for denominators and numerators of the approximations in terms of hypergeometric sums. As a consequence, we get rational approximations for the numbers \pi/2\pm\gamma. We compare the results obtained with those of T. Rivoal for the numbers \gamma+\ln(b) and prove denominators conjectures proposed by Rivoal for denominators of rational approximations for \gamma+\ln(b) and common denominators of simultaneous approximations for the numbers \gamma and \zeta(2)-\gamma^2.
