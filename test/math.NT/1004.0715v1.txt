We estimate the deviation of the number of solutions of the congruence  m^2-n^2 \equiv c \pmod q, \qquad 1 \le m \le M, \ 1\le n \le N,  from its expected value on average over c=1, ..., q. This estimate is motivated by the recently established by D. R. Heath-Brown connection between the distibution of solution to this congruence and the pair correlation problem for the fractional parts of the quadratic function \alpha k^2, k=1,2,... with a real \alpha.
