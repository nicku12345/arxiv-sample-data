In 2005 Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha, and Venjakob formulated a noncommutative Iwasawa main conjecture for l-adic Lie extensions of number fields. To provide evidence for this main conjecture we formulate and prove an analogous statement for l-adic Lie extensions of separated schemes of finite type over a finite field of characteristic prime to l.
