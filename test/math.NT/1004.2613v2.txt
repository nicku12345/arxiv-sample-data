We construct a finite subgroup of Brauer-Manin obstruction for detecting the existence of integral points on integral models of homogeneous spaces of linear algebraic groups of multiplicative type. As application, the strong approximation theorem for linear algebraic groups of multiplicative type is established. Moreover, the sum of two integral squares over some quadratic fields is discussed.
