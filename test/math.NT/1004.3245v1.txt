Consider a form g(x_1,...,x_s) of degree d, having coefficients in the completion F_q((1/t)) of the field of fractions F_q(t) associated to the finite field F_q. We establish that whenever s>d^2, then the form g takes arbitrarily small values for non-zero arguments x\in F_q[t]^s. We provide related results for problems involving distribution modulo F_q[t], and analogous conclusions for quasi-algebraically closed fields in general.
