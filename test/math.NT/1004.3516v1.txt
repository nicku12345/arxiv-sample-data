I am applying the Langlands-Shahidi method to the metaplectic double cover of Sp(2n). I proved that a Whittaker model of an irreducible admissible representation of this group is unique. As a result I was able to define the local coefficients for this group. I used them to determine irreducibility of parabolic induction. I also found some connections with the representation theory of SO(2n+1). I have defined local gamma factors and proved some properties of them.
