We describe an algorithm that computes explicit models of hyperelliptic Shimura curves attached to an indefnite quaternion algebra over Q and Atkin-Lehner quotients of them. It exploits Cerednik-Drinfeld's non-archimedean uniformisation of Shimura curves, a formula of Gross and Zagier for the endomorphism ring of Heegner points over Artinian rings and the connection between Ribet's bimodules and the specialization of Heegner points. As an application, we provide a list of equations of Shimura curves and quotients of them obtained by our algorithm that had been conjectured by Kurihara.
