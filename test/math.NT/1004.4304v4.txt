We state and prove a formula for a certain value of the Goss L-function of a Drinfeld module. This gives characteristic-p-valued function field analogues of the class number formula and of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The formula and its proof are presented in an entirely self-contained fashion.
