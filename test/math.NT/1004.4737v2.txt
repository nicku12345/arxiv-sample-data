The notion of cubic partitions is introduced by Hei-Chi Chan and named by Byungchan Kim in connection with Ramanujan's cubic continued fractions. Chan proved that cubic partition function has Ramanujan Type congruences modulo powers of 3. In a recent paper, William Y.C. Chen and Bernard L.S. Lin studied the congruent property of the cubic partition function modulo 5. In this note, we give Ramanujan type congruences for cubic partition function modulo powers of 5.
