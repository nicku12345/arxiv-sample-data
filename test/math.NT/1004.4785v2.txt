We present a method for tabulating all cubic function fields over \mathbb{F}_q(t) whose discriminant D has either odd degree or even degree and the leading coefficient of -3D is a non-square in \mathbb{F}_{q}^*, up to a given bound B on the degree of D. Our method is based on a generalization of Belabas' method for tabulating cubic number fields. The main theoretical ingredient is a generalization of a theorem of Davenport and Heilbronn to cubic function fields, along with a reduction theory for binary cubic forms that provides an efficient way to compute equivalence classes of binary cubic forms. The algorithm requires O(B^4 q^B) field operations as B \rightarrow \infty. The algorithm, examples and numerical data for q=5,7,11,13 are included.
