In this paper we improve estimates of Jarnik and Apfelbeck for uniform Diophantine exponents of transposed systems of linear forms and generalize to the case of an arbitrary system the estimates of Laurent and Bugeaud for individual exponents. The method proposed also gives a better constant in Mahler's transference theorem.
