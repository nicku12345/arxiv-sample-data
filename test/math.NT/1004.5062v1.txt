The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit dimension formula for the spaces of vector valued Siegel cusp forms of degree two with respect to a certain kind of arithmetic subgroups of the non-split Q-forms of Sp(2,R). We obtain our result by using Hashimoto and Ibukiyama's results in [HI80],[HI83] and Wakatsuki's formula in [Wak]. Our result is a generalization of formulae in [Has84,Theorem 4.1] and [Wak,Theorem 6.1].
