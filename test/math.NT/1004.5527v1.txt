Using the circle method in combination with lattice point counting arguments, we show that for almost all homogeneous diophantine equations of additive type and degree k in more than 4k variables, the Local-Global principle holds true. Moreover, our approach shows that almost all such equations having a non-trivial integer solution have a very small such solution, the bound being close to the best possible one.
