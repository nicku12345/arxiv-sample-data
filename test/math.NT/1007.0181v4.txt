For a rational prime p \geq 3 we consider p-ordinary, Hilbert modular newforms f of weight k\geq 2 with associated p-adic Galois representations \rho_f and \mod{p^n} reductions \rho_{f,n}. Under suitable hypotheses on the size of the image, we use deformation theory and modularity lifting to show that if the restrictions of \rho_{f,n}  to decomposition groups above p split then f has a companion form g modulo p^n (in the sense that \rho_{f,n}\sim \rho_{g,n}\otimes\chi^{k-1}).
