Let F/E be a finite Galois extension of fields with abelian Galois group \Gamma. A self-dual normal basis for F/E is a normal basis with the additional property that Tr_{F/E}(g(x),h(x))=\delta_{g,h} for g,h\in\Gamma. Bayer-Fluckiger and Lenstra have shown that when char(E)\neq 2, then F admits a self-dual normal basis if and only if [F:E] is odd. If F/E is an extension of finite fields and char(E)=2, then F admits a self-dual normal basis if and only if the exponent of \Gamma is not divisible by 4. In this paper we construct self-dual normal basis generators for finite extensions of finite fields whenever they exist.   Now let K be a finite extension of \Q_p, let L/K be a finite abelian Galois extension of odd degree and let \bo_L be the valuation ring of L. We define A_{L/K} to be the unique fractional \bo_L-ideal with square equal to the inverse different of L/K. It is known that a self-dual integral normal basis exists for A_{L/K} if and only if L/K is weakly ramified. Assuming p\neq 2, we construct such bases whenever they exist.
