Let K be a finite extension of \Q_p, let L/K be a finite abelian Galois extension of odd degree and let \bo_L be the valuation ring of L. We define A_{L/K} to be the unique fractional \bo_L-ideal with square equal to the inverse different of L/K. For p an odd prime and L/\Q_p contained in certain cyclotomic extensions, Erez has described integral normal bases for A_{L/\Q_p} that are self-dual with respect to the trace form. Assuming K/\Q_p to be unramified we generate odd abelian weakly ramified extensions of K using Lubin-Tate formal groups. We then use Dwork's exponential power series to explicitly construct self-dual integral normal bases for the square-root of the inverse different in these extensions.
