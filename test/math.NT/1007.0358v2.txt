Taylor-Wiles type lifting theorems allow one to deduce that for \rho a "sufficiently nice" l-adic representation of the absolute Galois group of a number field whose semi-simplified reduction modulo l, denoted \overline{\rho}, comes from an automorphic representation then so does \rho. The recent lifting theorems of Barnet-Lamb-Gee-Geraghty-Taylor impose a technical condition, called \emph{m-big}, upon the residual representation \overline{\rho}. Snowden-Wiles proved that for a sufficiently irreducible compatible system of Galois representations, the residual images are \emph{big} at a set of places of Dirichlet density 1. We demonstrate the analogous result in the \emph{m-big} setting using a mild generalization of their argument.
