Let N/F be an odd degree Galois extension of number fields with Galois group G and rings of integers {\mathfrak O}_N and {\mathfrak O}_F=\bo respectively. Let \mathcal{A} be the unique fractional {\mathfrak O}_N-ideal with square equal to the inverse different of N/F. Erez has shown that \mathcal{A} is a locally free {\mathfrak O}[G]-module if and only if N/F is a so called weakly ramified extension. There have been a number of results regarding the freeness of \mathcal{A} as a \Z[G]-module, however this question remains open. In this paper we prove that \mathcal{A} is free as a \Z[G]-module assuming that N/F is weakly ramified and under the hypothesis that for every prime \wp of {\mathfrak O} which ramifies wildly in N/F, the decomposition group is abelian, the ramification group is cyclic and \wp is unramified in F/\Q.   We make crucial use of a construction due to the first named author which uses Dwork's exponential power series to describe self-dual integral normal bases in Lubin-Tate extensions of local fields. This yields a new and striking relationship between the local norm-resolvent and Galois Gauss sum involved. Our results generalise work of the second named author concerning the case of base field \Q.
