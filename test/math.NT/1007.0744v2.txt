For a quadratic endomorphism of the affine line defined over the rationals we consider the problem of bounding the number of rational points that eventually land at a given constant after iteration, called pre-images of the constant. In the article "Uniform Bounds on Pre-Images Under Quadratic Dynamical Systems," it was shown that the number of rational pre-images is bounded as one varies the morphism in a certain one-dimensional family. Explicit values of the constant for pre-images of zero and -1 defined over the rational numbers were addressed in subsequent articles. This article addresses an explicit bound for any algebraic image constant and provides insight into the geometry of the "pre-image surfaces."
