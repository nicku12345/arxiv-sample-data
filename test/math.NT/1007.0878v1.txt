The explicit formulas of operations, in particular addition and multiplication, of p -adic integers are presented. As applications of the results, at first the explicit formulas of operations of Witt vectors with coefficients in \mathbb{F}_{2} are given; then, through solving a problem of Browkin about the transformation between the coefficients of a p-adic integer expressed in the ordinary least residue system and the numerically least residue system, similar formulas for Witt vectors with coefficients in \mathbb{F}_{3} are obtained.
