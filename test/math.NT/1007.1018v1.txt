We give a level one result for the "symmetry integral", say I_f(N,h), of essentially bounded f:\N \to \R; i.e., we get a kind of "square-root cancellation" \thinspace bound for the mean-square (in N<x\le 2N) of the "symmetry" \thinspace of, say, the arithmetic function f:=g\ast \1, where g:\N \to \R is such that \forall \epsilon>0 we have g(n)\ll_{\epsilon} n^{\epsilon}, and supported in [1,Q], with Q\ll N (so, the exponent of Q relative to N, say the level \lambda:=(\log Q)/(\log N) is \lambda < 1), where the symmetry sum weights the f-values in (almost all, i.e. all but o(N) possible exceptions) the short intervals [x-h,x+h] (with positive/negative sign at the right/left of x), with mild restrictions on h (say, h\to \infty and h=o(\sqrt N), as N\to \infty).
