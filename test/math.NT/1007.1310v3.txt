We give a new formula for the special value at s=2 of the Hasse-Weil zeta function for smooth projective fourfolds under some assumptions (the Tate and Beilinson conjecture, finiteness of some cohomology groups, etc.). Our formula may be considered as a generalization of the Artin-Tate(-Milne) formula for smooth surfaces, and expresses the special zeta value almost exclusively in terms of inner geometric invariants such as higher Chow groups (motivic cohomology groups). Moreover we compare our formula with Geisser's formula for the same zeta value in terms of Weil-\'etale motivic cohomology groups, and as a consequence (under additional assumptions) we obtain some presentations of weight two Weil-\'etale motivic cohomology groups in terms of higher Chow groups and unramified cohomology groups.
