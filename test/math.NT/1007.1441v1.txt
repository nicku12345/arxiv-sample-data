According to [1] an n-dimensional \mathcal{N}--set is a compact subset A of \mathbb{R}^n such that for every x in \mathbb{R}^n there is y in A with y-x in \mathbb{Z}^n. We prove that every two dimensional \mathcal{N}--set A must contain distinct points x,y such that x-y is in \mathbb{Z}^2 and x-y is neither horizontal nor vertical. This answers a question of P. Hegarty and M. Nathanson.
