Let p be a large prime number, K,L,M,\lambda be integers with 1\le M\le p and {\color{red}\gcd}(\lambda,p)=1. The aim of our paper is to obtain sharp upper bound estimates for the number I_2(M; K,L) of solutions of the congruence  xy\equiv\lambda \pmod p, \qquad K+1\le x\le K+M,\quad L+1\le y\le L+M  and for the number I_3(M;L) of solutions of the congruence xyz\equiv\lambda\pmod p, \quad L+1\le x,y,z\le L+M.  We obtain a bound for I_2(M;K,L), which improves several recent results of Chan and Shparlinski. For instance, we prove that if M<p^{1/4}, then I_2(M;K,L)\le M^{o(1)}. For I_3(M;L) we prove that if M<p^{1/8} then I_3(M;L)\le M^{o(1)}. Our results have applications to some other problems as well. For instance, it follows that if \mathcal{I}_1, \mathcal{I}_2, \mathcal{I}_3 are intervals in \F^*_p of length |\mathcal{I}_i|< p^{1/8}, then  |\mathcal{I}_1\cdot \mathcal{I}_2\cdot \mathcal{I}_3|= (|\mathcal{I}_1|\cdot |\mathcal{I}_2|\cdot |\mathcal{I}_3|)^{1-o(1)}.
