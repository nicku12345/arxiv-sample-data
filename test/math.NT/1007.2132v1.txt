The purpose of this paper is to show that under a part of generalized Arthur's A-packet conjecture, locally generic cuspidal automorphic representations of a quasisplit group over a number field are of Ramanujan type, i.e., are tempered at almost all places. The A-packet conjecture allows one to reduce the problem to a special case of a general local question about the components of the corresponding Langlands L-packet which is then answered here in its generality.
