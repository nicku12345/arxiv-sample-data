We derive a formula for Greenberg's L-invariant of Tate twists of the symmetric sixth power of an ordinary non-CM cuspidal newform of weight \geq4, under some technical assumptions. This requires a "sufficiently rich" Galois deformation of the symmetric cube which we obtain from the symmetric cube lift to \GSp(4)_{/\QQ} of Ramakrishnan--Shahidi and the Hida theory of this group developed by Tilouine--Urban. The L-invariant is expressed in terms of derivatives of Frobenius eigenvalues varying in the Hida family. Our result suggests that one could compute Greenberg's L-invariant of all symmetric powers by using appropriate functorial transfers and Hida theory on higher rank groups.
