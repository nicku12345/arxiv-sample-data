By a change of variables we obtain new y-coordinates of elliptic curves. Utilizing these y-coordinates as modular functions, together with the elliptic modular function, we generate the modular function fields of level N\geq3. Furthermore, by means of the singular values of the y-coordinates we construct the ray class fields modulo N over imaginary quadratic fields as well as normal bases of these ray class fields.
