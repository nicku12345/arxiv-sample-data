We develop a criterion for a normal basis, and prove that the singular values of certain Siegel functions form normal bases of ray class fields over imaginary quadratic fields other than \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1}) and \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3}). This result would be an answer for the Lang-Schertz conjecture on a ray class field with modulus generated by an integer (\geq2).
