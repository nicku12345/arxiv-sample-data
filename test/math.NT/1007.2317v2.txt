Let K be an imaginary quadratic field of discriminant less than or equal to -7 and K_{(N)} be its ray class field modulo N for an integer N greater than 1. We prove that singular values of certain Siegel functions generate K_{(N)} over K by extending the idea of our previous work. These generators are not only the simplest ones conjectured by Schertz, but also quite useful in the matter of computation of class polynomials. We indeed give an algorithm to find all conjugates of such generators by virtue of Gee and Stevenhagen.
