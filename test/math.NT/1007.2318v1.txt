Let K be an imaginary quadratic field with discriminant d_K\leq-7. We deal with problems of constructing normal bases between abelian extensions of K by making use of singular values of Siegel functions. First, we show that a criterion achieved from the Frobenius determinant relation enables us to find normal bases of ring class fields of orders of bounded conductors depending on d_K over K. Next, denoting by K_{(N)} the ray class field modulo N of K for an integer N\geq2 we consider the field extension K_{(p^2m)}/K_{(pm)} for a prime p\geq5 and an integer m\geq1 relatively prime to p and then find normal bases of all intermediate fields over K_{(pm)} by utilizing Kawamoto's arguments. And, we further investigate certain Galois module structure of the field extension K_{(p^{n}m)}/K_{(p^{\ell}m)} with n\geq 2\ell, which would be an extension of Komatsu's work.
