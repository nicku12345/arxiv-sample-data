This is an exposition of recent developments in the theory of bounded differences between primes. Readers are expected to be beginners of analytic number theory.   The present text is a substantially improved and augmented version of the one that I had prepared for my talk which I delivered at the Annual Meeting of the Mathematical Society of Japan on 15 March 2014.
