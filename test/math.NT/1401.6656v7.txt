In this paper we study Gaussian ring \Z[i] with a focus on representing Gaussian Mersenne primes G_p in the form x^2+7y^2. Interestingly when such a form exists, one can observe that, x\equiv \pm 1\pmod{8} and y\equiv 0\pmod{8}. To prove this property of Gaussian Mersenne primes, we show that Gaussian Mersenne primes splits completely in the cyclic quartic unramified extension of \Q(\sqrt{-14}) and have a trivial Artin symbol in this extension. We generalize this result for d\equiv 7\pmod{24}. We also attempt to give an alternate proof using Artin's reciprocity law, which was earlier given by H. W. Lenstra and P. Stevenhagen to prove a similar property on ordinary Mersenne Primes.
