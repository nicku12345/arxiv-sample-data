A new and exciting breakthrough due to Maynard establishes that there exist infinitely many pairs of distinct primes p_1,p_2 with |p_1-p_2|\leq 600 as a consequence of the Bombieri-Vinogradov Theorem. In this paper, we apply his general method to the setting of Chebotarev sets of primes. We study applications of these bounded gaps with an emphasis on ranks of prime quadratic twists of elliptic curves over \mathbb{Q}, congruence properties of the Fourier coefficients of normalized Hecke eigenforms, and representations of primes by binary quadratic forms.
