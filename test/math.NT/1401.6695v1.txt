Fix an integer \kappa\geqslant 2. Let P be prime and let k> \kappa be an even integer. For f a holomorphic cusp form of weight k and full level and g a primitive holomorphic cusp form of weight 2 \kappa and level P, we prove hybrid subconvexity bounds for L \left(\tfrac{1}{2}, \text{Sym}^2 f \otimes g\right) in the k and P aspects when P^{\frac {13} {64} + \delta} < k < P^{\frac 3 8 - \delta} for any 0 < \delta < \frac {11} {128}. These bounds are achieved through a first moment method (with amplification when P^{\frac {13} {64}} < k \leqslant P^{\frac 4 {13}}).
