Let K/Q be a Galois extension of degree n, of Galois group G, and let \eta\in K^\times. For all large enough prime p, we define, by use of the Frobenius theorem on group determinants, the family (\Delta_p^\theta(\eta) \in \F_p)_\theta of local \theta-regulators of \eta, indexed by the Qp-irreducible characters \theta of G. At each \Delta_p^\theta (\eta) is associated a linear representation L^\theta \simeq \delta V_\theta, 0 \leq \delta \leq \varphi(1), which characterizes some properties of \Delta_p^\theta (\eta), including its nullity equivalent to \delta \geq 1 (Th. 3.11). When \eta \in \Q^\times and \theta = 1, \Delta_p^1 (\eta) is the p-Fermat quotient of \eta. When \eta is a "Minkowski unit", each \Delta_p^\theta (\eta), \theta \ne 1, gives the residue modulo p of the \theta-component of p^{1-n} Reg_p (K), where Reg(K) is the classical p-adic regulator of K. We suggest that the "probability" of (\Delta_p^\theta(\eta) = 0 and L^\theta \simeq \delta V_\theta) is \frac{O(1)}{p^{f \delta^2}}, where f is a suitable residue degree of p. We conjecture that p^{1-n} Reg_p(K), which measures the order of the p-torsion group in Abelian p-ramification over K, is for p large enough a p-adic unit except perhaps for a set of prime numbers of zero density. For these cases said "of minimal p-divisibility" (Def. 3.17), it remains possible, \eta being then a "partial local pth power" at p, to propose, in connection with the ABC conjecture, a stronger conjecture leading to the same conclusion for all large enough p (Section 7). Some other conjectural aspects on the Fermat quotient are discussed. We precise and verify these properties through numerical studies on various fields and publish the corresponding "PARI" programs.
