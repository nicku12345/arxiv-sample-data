We establish an essentially optimal estimate for the ninth moment of the exponential sum having argument \alpha x^3+\beta x. The first substantial advance in this topic for over 60 years, this leads to improvements in Heath-Brown's variant of Weyl's inequality, and other applications of Diophantine type.
