In this paper we establish several results concerning the generalized Ramanujan primes. For n\in\mathbb{N} and k \in \mathbb{R}_{> 1} we give estimates for the nth k-Ramanujan prime which lead both to generalizations and to improvements of the results presently in the literature. Moreover, we obtain results about the distribution of k-Ramanujan primes. In addition, we find explicit formulae for certain nth k-Ramanujan primes. As an application, we prove that a conjecture of Mitra, Paul and Sarkar concerning the number of primes in certain intervals holds for every sufficiently large positive integer.
