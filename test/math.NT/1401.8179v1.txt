For a given group G and an elliptic curve E defined over a number field K, I discuss the problem of finding G-extensions of K over which E gains rank. I prove the following theorem, extending a result of Fearnley, Kisilevsky, and Kuwata: Let n = 3,4, or 6. If K contains its n^{th}-roots of unity then, for any elliptic curve E over K, there are infinitely many \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}-extensions of K over which E gains rank.
