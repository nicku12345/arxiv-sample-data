A classical theorem in number theory due to Euler states that a positive integer z can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if all prime factors q of z, with q\equiv 3 \pmod{4}, have even exponent in the prime factorization of z. One can consider a minor variation of this theorem by not allowing the use of zero as a summand in the representation of z as the sum of two squares. Viewing each of these questions in \Z_n, the ring of integers modulo n, we give a characterization of all integers n\ge 2 such that every z\in \Z_n can be written as the sum of two squares in \Z_n.
