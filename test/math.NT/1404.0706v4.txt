We prove an isomorphism between the finite domain from 1 up to the product of the first n primes and the new defined set of prime modular numbers. This definition provides some insights about relative prime numbers. We provide an inverse function from the prime modular numbers into this finite domain. With this function we can calculate all numbers from 1 up to the product of the first n primes that are not divisible by the first n primes. This function provides a non sequential way for the calculation of prime numbers.
