Let F be a non-Archimedean locally compact field of residue characteristic p, let D be a finite dimensional central division F-algebra and let l be a prime number different from p. We develop a theory of l-modular types for the group GL(m,D), m\>1, in preparation of the study of the l-modular smooth representations of this group.
