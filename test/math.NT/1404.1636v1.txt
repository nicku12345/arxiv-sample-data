In this paper we generalized Venkatesh and Woodbury's work on the subconvexity bound of triple product L-function in level aspect, allowing joint ramifications, higher ramifications, general unitary central characters and general special values of local epsilon factors. In particular we derived a nice general formula for the local integrals whenever one of the representations has sufficiently higher level than the other two.
