Using quasimodular forms with respect to \Gamma_0(4) we find exact relations between the M2-rank for partitions without repeated odd parts and three residual cranks. From these identities we are able to deduce various congruences mod 3 and 5 between the rank and crank moments. In turn, these congruences give congruences for M2spt(n), the number of occurrences of smallest parts in the partitions of n with smallest part even and without repeated odd parts, and for the higher order analog M2spt_2(n).
