Let M,N be coprime square-free integers. Let f be a holomorphic cusp form of level N and g be either a holomorphic or a Maa{\ss} form with level M. Using a large sieve inequality, we establish a bound of the form \sum_{g}\left|L^{(j)}\left(1/2+it,f \otimes g\right)\right|^2 \ll_t M+M^{2/3-\beta}N^{4/3} where \beta \approx 1/500. As a consequence, we obtain subconvexity bounds for L^{(j)}\left(1/2+it,f \otimes g\right)\ll (MN)^{1/2 - \alpha} for any N<M satisfying the conditions above without using amplification methods. Moreover, by the symmetry, we establish a level aspect hybrid subconvexity bound for the full range when both forms are holomorphic.
