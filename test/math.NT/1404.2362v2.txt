Let p>3 be a prime number and let G_{\mathbb{Q}_p} be the absolute Galois group of \mathbb{Q}_p. In this paper, we find Galois stable lattices in the irreducible 3-dimensional semi-stable and non-crystalline representations of G_{\mathbb{Q}_p} with Hodge--Tate weights (0,1,2) by constructing their strongly divisible modules. We also compute the Breuil modules corresponding to the mod p reductions of the strongly divisible modules, and determine which of the semi-stable representations has an absolutely irreducible mod p reduction.
