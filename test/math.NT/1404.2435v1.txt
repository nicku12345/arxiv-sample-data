Random matrix theory has successfully modeled many systems in physics and mathematics, and often the analysis and results in one area guide development in the other. Hughes and Rudnick computed 1-level density statistics for low-lying zeros of the family of primitive Dirichlet L-functions of fixed prime conductor Q, as Q \to \infty, and verified the unitary symmetry predicted by random matrix theory. We compute 1- and 2-level statistics of the analogous family of Dirichlet L-functions over \mathbb{F}_q(T). Whereas the Hughes-Rudnick results were restricted by the support of the Fourier transform of their test function, our test function is periodic and our results are only restricted by a decay condition on its Fourier coefficients. We show the main terms agree with unitary symmetry, and also isolate error terms. In concluding, we discuss an \mathbb{F}_q(T)-analogue of Montgomery's Hypothesis on the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, which Fiorilli and Miller show would remove the restriction on the Hughes-Rudnick results.
