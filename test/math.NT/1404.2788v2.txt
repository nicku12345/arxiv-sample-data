Let A be an abelian variety defined over a global field F of positive characteristic p and let \calf/F be a \Z_p^{\N}-extension, unramified outside a finite set of places of F. Assuming that all ramified places are totally ramified, we define a pro-characteristic ideal associated to the Pontrjagin dual of the p-primary Selmer group of A, in order to formulate an Iwasawa Main Conjecture for the non-noetherian commutative Iwasawa algebra \Z_p[[\Gal(\calf/F)]] (which we also prove for a constant abelian variety). To do this we first show the relation between the characteristic ideals of duals of Selmer groups for a \Z_p^d-extension \calf_d/F and for any \Z_p^{d-1}-extension contained in \calf_d\,, and then use a limit process.
