Let K_i be a number field for all i \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0} and let \mathcal{E} be a family of elliptic curves containing infinitely many members defined over K_i for all i. Fix a rational prime p. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of an integer i_0 such that, for all i > i_0 and all elliptic curve E \in \mathcal{E} having good reduction at all \mathfrak{p} \mid p in K_i, we have that E has good ordinary reduction at all primes \mathfrak{p} \mid p.
