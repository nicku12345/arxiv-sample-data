Let p be a prime and {\mathfrak P}_p the set of positive integers which are prime to p. Recently, Wang and Cai proved that for every positive integer r and prime p>2  \sum_{\substack{i+j+k=p^r\\ i,j,k\in{\mathfrak P}_p}} \frac1{ijk} \equiv   -2p^{r-1} B_{p-3} \pmod{p^r},  where B_{p-3} is the (p-3)-rd Bernoulli number. In this paper we prove the following analogous result: Let n=2 or 4. Then for every positive integer r\ge n/2 and prime p>4  \sum_{\substack{i_1+\cdots+i_n=p^r\\ i_1,\dots,i_n\in{\mathfrak P}_p}} \frac1{i_1i_2\cdots i_n} \equiv   -\frac{n!}{n+1} p^{r} B_{p-n-1} \pmod{p^{r+1}}.  Moreover, by using integer relation detecting tool PSLQ we can show that generalizations with larger integers n should involving finite multiple zeta values generated by Bernoulli numbers.
