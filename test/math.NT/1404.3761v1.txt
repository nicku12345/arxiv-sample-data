Let p_1\equiv p_2\equiv -q\equiv1 \pmod4 be different primes such that \displaystyle\left(\frac{2}{p_1}\right)= \displaystyle\left(\frac{2}{p_2}\right)=\displaystyle\left(\frac{p_1}{q}\right)=\displaystyle\left(\frac{p_2}{q}\right)=-1. Put d=p_1p_2q and i=\sqrt{-1}, then the bicyclic biquadratic field {k}=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d},i) has an elementary abelian 2-class group, \mathbf{C}l_2(k), of rank 3. In this paper, we study the principalization of the 2-classes of {k} in its fourteen unramified abelian extensions \mathbb{K}_j and \mathbb{L}_j within {k}_2^{(1)}, that is the Hilbert 2-class field of {k}. We determine the nilpotency class, the coclass, generators and the structure of the metabelian Galois group G=\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{L}/{k}) of the second Hilbert 2-class field {k}_2^{(2)} of {k}. Additionally, the abelian type invariants of the groups \mathbf{C}l_2(\mathbb{K}_j) and \mathbf{C}l_2(\mathbb{L}_j) and the length of the 2-class tower of {k} are given.
