Fix an integer g \neq -1 that is not a perfect square. In 1927, Artin conjectured that there are infinitely many primes for which g is a primitive root. Forty years later, Hooley showed that Artin's conjecture follows from the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). We inject Hooley's analysis into the Maynard--Tao work on bounded gaps between primes. This leads to the following GRH-conditional result: Fix an integer m \geq 2. If q_1 < q_2 < q_3 < \dots is the sequence of primes possessing g as a primitive root, then \liminf_{n\to\infty} (q_{n+(m-1)}-q_n) \leq C_m, where C_m is a finite constant that depends on m but not on g. We also show that the primes q_n, q_{n+1}, \dots, q_{n+m-1} in this result may be taken to be consecutive.
