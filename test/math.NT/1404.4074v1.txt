We show that for a large class of finite groups G, the number of Galois extensions E/Q of group G and discriminant |d_E|\leq y grows like a power of y (for some specified exponent). The groups G are the regular Galois groups over Q and the extensions E/Q that we count are obtained by specialization from a given regular Galois extension F/Q(T). The extensions E/Q can further be prescribed any unramified local behavior at each suitably large prime p\leq \log (y)/\delta for some \delta\geq 1. This result is a step toward the Malle conjecture on the number of Galois extensions of given group and bounded discriminant. The local conditions further make it a notable constraint on regular Galois groups over Q. The method uses the notion of self-twisted cover that we introduce.
