In this article, first we generalize the Thue-Morse sequence (a(n))_{n=0}^\infty (the generalized Thue-Morse sequences) by a cyclic permutation and k -adic expansion of natural numbers, and consider the necessary-sufficient condition that it is non-periodic. Moreover we will show that, if the generalized Thue-Morse sequence is not periodic, then all equally spaced subsequences (a(N+nl))_{n=0}^\infty (where N \ge 0 and l >0) of the generalized Thue-Morse sequences are not periodic. Finally we apply the criterion of [ABL], [Bu1] on transcendental numbers, to find that , for a non periodic generalized Thue-Morse sequences taking the values on \{0,1,\cdots,\beta-1\}(where \beta is an integer greater than 1), the series \sum_{n=0}^\infty a(N+nl) {\beta}^{-n-1} gives a transcendental number, and further that for non periodic generalized Thue-Morse sequences taking the values on positive integers, the continued fraction [0:a(N), a(N+l),\cdots,a(N+nl ), \cdots] gives a transcendental number, too.
