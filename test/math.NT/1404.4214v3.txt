Let N_k(n,r,\boldsymbol{a}) denote the number of incongruent solutions of the quadratic congruence a_1x_1^2+\ldots+a_kx_k^2\equiv n (mod r), where \boldsymbol{a}=(a_1,\ldots,a_k)\in {\Bbb Z}^k, n\in {\Bbb Z}, r\in {\Bbb N}. We give short direct proofs for certain less known compact formulas on N_k(n,r,\boldsymbol{a}), valid for r odd, which go back to the work of Minkowski, Bachmann and Cohen. We also deduce some other related identities and asymptotic formulas which do not seem to appear in the literature.
