The class-invariant homomorphism allows one to measure the Galois module structure of extensions obtained by dividing points on abelian varieties. In this paper, we consider the case when the abelian variety is the Jacobian of a Fermat curve. We give examples of torsion points whose associated Galois structure is trivial, as well as points of infinite order whose associated Galois structure is non-trivial.
