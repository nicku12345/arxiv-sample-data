Dedekind sums s(m,n) occur in many fields of mathematics. Since s(m_1,n)=s(m_2,n) if m_1\equiv m_2 mod n, it is natural to ask which of the Dedekind sums s(m,n), 0\le m<n, take equal values. So far no simple criterion is known by which the equality of s(m_1,n) and s(m_2,n) could be decided. In this note we show how to obtain non-obvious examples of equal Dedekind sums. We consider two cases which mark the extreme possibilities for the argument n, namely, n a prime power and n square-free. Whereas we can give a partial overview of equal Dedekind sums in the prime power case, such an overview seems to be much more difficult to obtain in the square-free case.
