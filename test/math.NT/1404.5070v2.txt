In the present paper we obtain new upper bound estimates for the number of solutions of the congruence  x\equiv y r\pmod p;\quad x,y\in \mathbb{N},\quad x,y\le H,\quad r\in\cU,  for certain ranges of H and |\cU|, where \cU is a subset of the field of residue classes modulo p having small multiplicative doubling. We then use this estimate to show that the number of solutions of the congruence  x^n\equiv \lambda\pmod p; \quad x\in \N, \quad L<x<L+p/n,  is at most p^{\frac{1}{3}-c} uniformly over positive integers n, \lambda and L, for some absolute constant c>0. This implies, in particular, that if f(x)\in \Z[x] is a fixed polynomial without multiple roots in \C, then the congruence  x^{f(x)}\equiv 1\pmod p, \,x\in \mathbb{N}, \,x\le p, has at most p^{\frac{1}{3}-c} solutions as p\to\infty, improving some recent results of Kurlberg, Luca and Shparlinski and of Balog, Broughan and Shparlinski. We use our results to show that almost all the residue classes modulo p can be represented in the form xg^y \pmod p with positive integers x<p^{5/8+\varepsilon} and y<p^{3/8}. Here g denotes a primitive root modulo p. We also prove that almost all the residue classes modulo p can be represented in the form xyzg^t \pmod p with positive integers x,y,z,t<p^{1/4+\varepsilon}.
