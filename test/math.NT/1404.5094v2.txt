Let p_n denote the nth smallest prime number, and let \boldsymbol{L} denote the set of limit points of the sequence \{(p_{n+1} - p_n)/\log p_n\}_{n = 1}^{\infty} of normalized differences between consecutive primes. We show that for k = 9 and for any sequence of k nonnegative real numbers \beta_1 \le \beta_2 \le ... \le \beta_k, at least one of the numbers \beta_j - \beta_i (1 \le i < j \le k) belongs to \boldsymbol{L}. It follows at least 12.5% of all nonnegative real numbers belong to \boldsymbol{L}.
