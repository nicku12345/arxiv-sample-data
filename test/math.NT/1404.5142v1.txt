We explain how the work of Johnson-Leung and Roberts on lifting Hilbert modular forms for real quadratic fields to Siegel modular forms can be adapted to imaginary quadratic fields. For this we use archimedean results from Harris, Soudry, Taylor and replace the global arguments of Roberts by the non-vanishing result of Takeda. As an application of our lifting result, we exhibit an abelian surface B defined over \mathbb{Q}, which is not restriction of scalars of an elliptic curve and satisfies the Brumer-Kramer Paramodularity Conjecture.
