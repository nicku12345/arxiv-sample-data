We prove several results regarding some invariants of elliptic curves on average over the family of all elliptic curves inside a box of sides A and B. As an example, let E be an elliptic curve defined over \mathbb{Q} and p be a prime of good reduction for E. Let e_{E}(p) be the exponent of the group of rational points of the reduction modulo p of E over the finite field \mathbb{F}_p. Let \mathcal{C} be the family of elliptic curves E_{a,b}:~y^2=x^3+ax+b, where |a|\leq A and |b|\leq B. We prove that, for any c>1 and k\in \mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|} \sum_{E\in \mathcal{C}} \sum_{p\leq x} e_E^k(p) = C_k {\rm li}(x^{k+1})+O\left(\frac{x^{k+1}}{(\log{x})^c} \right), as x\rightarrow \infty, as long as A, B>\exp\left(c_{1} (\log{x})^{1/2} \right) and AB>x(\log{x})^{4+2c}, where c_1 is a suitable positive constant. Here C_k is an explicit constant given in the paper which depends only on k, and {\rm li}(x)=\int_{2}^x dt/\log{t}. We prove several similar results as corollaries to a general theorem. The method of the proof is capable of improving some of the known results with A, B>x^\epsilon and AB>x(\log{x})^\delta to A, B>\exp\left(c_1 (\log{x})^{1/2} \right) and AB>x(\log{x})^\delta.
