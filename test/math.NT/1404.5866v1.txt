We use bounds of mixed character sums modulo a prime p to estimate the density of integer points on the hypersurface  f_1(x_1) + \ldots + f_n(x_n) =a x_1^{k_1} \ldots x_n^{k_n}  for some polynomials f_i \in {\mathbb Z}[X], nonzero integer a and positive integers k_i i=1, \ldots, n. In the case of  f_1(X) = \ldots = f_n(X) = X^2 \quad \text{and}\quad k_1 = \ldots = k_n =1  the above congruence is known as the Markoff-Hurwitz hypersurface, while for  f_1(X) = \ldots = f_n(X) = X^n\quad \text{and}\quad k_1 = \ldots = k_n =1  it is known as the Dwork hypersurface. Our result is substantially stronger than those known for general hypersurfaces.
