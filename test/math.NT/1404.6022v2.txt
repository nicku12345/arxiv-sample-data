We prove an inverse ternary Goldbach-type result. Let N be sufficiently large and c>0 be sufficiently small. If A_1,A_2,A_3\subset [N] are subsets with |A_1|,|A_2|,|A_3|\geq N^{1/3-c}, then A_1+A_2+A_3 contains a composite number. This improves on the bound N^{1/3} from Gallagher's larger sieve. The main ingredients in our argument include a type of inverse sieve result in the larger sieve regime, and a variant of the analytic large sieve inequality.
