In an article in the Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly in 2008, Duke and Jenkins investigated a certain natural basis of the space of weakly holomorphic modular forms for the full modular group SL_2({\bf Z}). We show here that their results can be generalized to certain moonshine groups, also allowing characters that are real on the underlying subgroup \Gamma_0(N).
