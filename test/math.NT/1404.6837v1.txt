In this paper, we investigate cycle integrals of weakly holomorphic modular forms. We show that these integrals coincide with the cycle integrals of classical cusp forms. We use these results to define a Shintani lift from integral weight weakly holomorphic modular forms to half-integral weight holomorphic modular forms.
