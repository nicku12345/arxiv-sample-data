Let \pi be an irreducible unitary cuspidal representation for GL_m({\Bbb A}_{\Bbb Q}), and let L(s, \pi) be the automorphic L-function attached to \pi, which has a Dirichlet series expression in the half-plane \mbox{Re} s>1. When \pi is self-contragredient, all the coefficients in the Dirichlet series expression are real. In this paper we give non-trivial lower bounds for the number of positive and negative coefficients, respectively.
