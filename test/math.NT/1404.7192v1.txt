Let p be a prime number. In this article we present a theorem, suggested by Peter Scholze, which states that the absolute Galois group of \mathbf{Q}_p is the \'etale fundamental group of a certain object Z which is defined over an algebraically closed field. Thus, local Galois representations correspond to local systems on Z. In brief, Z is a (non-representable) quotient of a perfectoid space. The construction combines two themes: the fundamental curve of p-adic Hodge theory (due to Fargues-Fontaine) and the tilting equivalence (due to Scholze).
