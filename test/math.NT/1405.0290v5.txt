We make many new observations on primitive roots modulo primes. For an odd prime p and an integer c, we establish a theorem concerning \sum_g(\frac{g+c}p), where g runs over all the primitive roots modulo p among 1,\ldots,p-1, and (\frac{\cdot}p) denotes the Legendre symbol. On the basis of our numerical computations, we formulate 35 conjectures involving primitive roots modulo primes. For example, we conjecture that for any prime p there is a primitive root g<p modulo p with g-1 a square, and that for any prime p>3 there is a prime q<p with the Bernoulli number B_{q-1} a primitive root modulo p. We also make related observations on quadratic nonresidues modulo primes and primitive prime divisors of some combinatorial sequences. For example, based on heuristic arguments we conjecture that for any prime p>3 there exists a Fibonacci number F_k<p/2 which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p; this implies that there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to find square roots of quadratic residues modulo a prime p>3.
