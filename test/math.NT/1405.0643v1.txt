Let \pi be an irreducible unitary cuspidal representation of GL_m({\Bbb A}_{\Bbb Q}) and L(s,\,\pi) be the global L-function attached to \pi. If {\rm Re}(s)>1, L(s,\,\pi) has a Dirichlet series expression. When \pi is self-contragradient, all the coefficients of Dirichlet series are real. In this note, we shall give non-trivial lower bounds for the number of positive and negative coefficients respectively, which is an improvement on the recent work of Jianya Liu and Jie Wu.
