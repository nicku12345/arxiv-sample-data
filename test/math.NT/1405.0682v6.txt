In this note we describe weight functions that exhibit a transitional behavior between weak and strong correlation with the Liouville function. We also describe a binary problem which may be considered as an interpolation between Chowla's conjecture for two-point correlations of the M\"obius function and the twin prime conjecture, in view of recent parity breaking results of K. Matom\"aki, M. Radziwi{\l}{\l} and T. Tao.
