This paper has two main parts. First, we construct certain differential operators, which generalize operators studied by G. Shimura. Then, as an application of some of these differential operators, we construct certain p-adic families of automorphic forms. Building on the author's earlier work, these differential operators map automorphic forms on a unitary group of signature (n,n) to (vector-valued) automorphic forms on the product U^\varphi\times U^{-\varphi} of two unitary groups, where U^\varphi denotes the unitary group associated to a Hermitian form \varphi of arbitrary signature on an n-dimensional vector space. These differential operators have both a p-adic and a C-infinity incarnation. In the scalar-weight, C-infinity case, these operators agree with ones studied by Shimura. In the final section of the paper, we also discuss some generalizations to other groups and settings.   The results from this paper apply to the author's paper-in-preparation with J. Fintzen, E. Mantovan, and I. Varma and to her ongoing joint project with M. Harris, J. -S. Li, and C. Skinner; they also relate to her recent paper with X. Wan.
