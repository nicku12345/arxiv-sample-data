In previous work, Ohno conjectured, and Nakagawa proved, relations between the counting functions of certain cubic fields. These relations may be viewed as complements to the Scholz reflection principle, and Ohno and Nakagawa deduced them as consequences of `extra functional equations' involving the Shintani zeta functions associated to the prehomogeneous vector space of binary cubic forms.   In the present paper we generalize their result by proving a similar identity relating certain degree l fields with Galois groups D_l and F_l respectively, for any odd prime l, and in particular we give another proof of the Ohno-Nakagawa relation without appealing to binary cubic forms.
