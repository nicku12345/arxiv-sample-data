Let \mathcal{E}_d^{(s)} denote the set of coefficient vectors (a_1,\dots,a_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d of contractive polynomials x^d+a_1x^{d-1}+\dots+a_d\in \mathbb{R}[x] that have exactly s pairs of complex conjugate roots and let v_d^{(s)}=\lambda_d(\mathcal{E}_d^{(s)}) be its (d-dimensional) Lebesgue measure. We settle the instance s=1 of a conjecture by Akiyama and Peth\H{o}, stating that the ratio v_d^{(s)}/v_d^{(0)} is an integer for all d\ge 2s. Moreover we establish the surprisingly simple formula v_d^{(1)}/v_d^{(0)} = (P_d(3)-2d-1)/4, where P_d(x) are the Legendre polynomials.
