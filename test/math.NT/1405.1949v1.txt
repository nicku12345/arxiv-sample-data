Holzer proves that Legendre's equation ax^2+by^2+cz^2=0,  expressed in its normal form, when having a nontrivial solution in the integers, has a solution (x,y,z) where |x|\leq\sqrt{|bc|}, \quad |y|\leq\sqrt{|ac|}, \quad |z|\leq\sqrt{|ab|}. This paper proves a similar version of the theorem, for Legendre's equation with coefficients a, b,c in Gaussian integers \mathbb{Z}[i] in which there is a solution (x,y,z) where  |z|\leq\sqrt{(1+\sqrt{2})|ab|}.
