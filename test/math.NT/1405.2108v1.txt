Every nontrivial abelian variety over a Hilbertian field in which the weak Mordell-Weil theorem holds admits infinitely many torsors with period any n > 1 which is not divisible by the characteristic. The corresponding statement with "period" replaced by "index" is plausible but much more challenging. We show that for every infinite, finitely generated field K, there is an elliptic curve E_{/K} which admits infinitely many torsors with index any n > 1.
