Let E/\mathbb{Q} be an elliptic curve which has split multiplicative reduction at a prime p and whose analytic rank r_{an}(E) equals one. The main goal of this article is to relate the second order derivative of the Mazur-Tate-Teitelbaum p-adic L-function L_p(E,s) of E to Nekov\'{a}\v{r}'s height pairing evaluated on natural elements arising from the Beilinson-Kato elements. Along the way, we extend a Rubin-style formula of Nekov\'a\v{r} (or in an alternative wording, correct another Rubin-style formula of his) to apply in the presence of exceptional zeros. Our height formula allows us, among other things, to compare the order of vanishing of L_p(E,s) at s=1 to its (complex) analytic rank r_{an}(E) assuming the non-triviality of the height pairing. This has consequences towards a conjecture of Mazur, Tate and Teitelbaum.
