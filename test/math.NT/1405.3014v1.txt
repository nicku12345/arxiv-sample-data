We study the weight part of (a generalisation of) Serre's conjecture for mod l Galois representations associated to automorphic representations on unitary groups of rank n for odd primes l. Given a modular Galois representation, we use automorphy lifting theorems to prove that it is modular in many other weights. We make no assumptions on the ramification or inertial degrees of l. We give an explicit strengthened result when n = 3 and l splits completely in the underlying CM field.
