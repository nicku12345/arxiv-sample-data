Let \omega(n) (resp. \Omega(n)) denote the number of prime divisors (resp. with multiplicity) of a natural number n. In 1917, Hardy and Ramanujan proved that the normal order of \omega(n) is \log\log n, and the same is true of \Omega(n); roughly speaking, a typical natural number n has about \log\log n prime factors. We prove a similar result for \omega(s(n)), where s(n) denotes the sum of the proper divisors of n: For any \epsilon > 0 and all n \leq x not belonging to a set of size o(x), \[ |\omega(s(n)) - \log\log s(n)| < \epsilon \log\log s(n) \] and the same is true for \Omega(s(n)).
