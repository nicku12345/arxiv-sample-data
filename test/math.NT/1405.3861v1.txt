Suppose K is unramified over \mathbb Q _p and \Gamma _K=\operatorname{Gal}(\bar K/K). Let H be a torsion \Gamma _K-equivariant subquotient of crystalline \mathbb Q _p[\Gamma _K]-module with HT weights from [0,p-2]. We give a new proof of Fontaine's conjecture about the triviality of action of some ramification subgroups \Gamma _K^{(v)} on H. The earlier author's proof from [1] contains a gap and proves this conjecture only for some subgroups of index p in \Gamma _K^{(v)}.
