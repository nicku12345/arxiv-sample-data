For each of the functions f \in \{\phi, \sigma, \omega, \tau\} and every natural number k, we show that there are infinitely many solutions to the inequalities f(p_n-1) < f(p_{n+1}-1) < \dots < f(p_{n+k}-1), and similarly for f(p_n-1) > f(p_{n+1}-1) > \dots > f(p_{n+k}-1). We also answer some questions of Sierpi\'nski on the digit sums of consecutive primes. The arguments make essential use of Maynard and Tao's method for producing many primes in intervals of bounded length.
