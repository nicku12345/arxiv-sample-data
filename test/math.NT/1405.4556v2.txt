Let \mathcal X_g be a genus g\geq 2 superelliptic curve, F its field of moduli, and K the minimal field of definition. In this short note we construct an equation of the curve \mathcal X_g over its minimal field of definition K when \mathcal X_g has extra automorphisms. We make use of the dihedral invariants of superelliptic curves as defined by Shaska in [6] and results on the automorphism groups of superelliptic curves as in [10].
