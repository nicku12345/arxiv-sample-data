Let \phi denote a primitive Hecke-Maass cusp form for \Gamma_o(N) with the Laplacian eigenvalue \lambda_\phi=1/4+t_{\phi}^2. In this work we show that there exists a prime p such that p\nmid N, |\alpha_{p}|=|\beta_{p}| = 1, and p\ll(N(1+|t_{\phi}|))^c, where \alpha _{p},\;\beta _{p} are the Satake parameters of \phi at p, and c is an absolute constant with 0<c<1. In fact, c can be taken as 0.27332. In addition, we prove that the natural density of such primes p (p\nmid N and |\alpha_{p}|=|\beta_{p}| = 1) is at least 34/35.
