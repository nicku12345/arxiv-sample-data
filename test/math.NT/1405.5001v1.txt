Let A be an abelian variety over a number field k and F a finite cyclic extension of k of p-power degree for an odd prime p. Under certain technical hypotheses, we obtain a reinterpretation of the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture (eTNC) for A, F/k and p as an explicit family of p-adic congru- ences involving values of derivatives of the Hasse-Weil L-functions of twists of A, normalised by completely explicit twisted regulators. This reinterpretation makes the eTNC amenable to numerical verification and furthermore leads to explicit predictions which refine well-known conjectures of Mazur and Tate.
