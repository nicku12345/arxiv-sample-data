We study the low-lying zeros of L-functions attached to quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve E defined over \mathbb Q. We are primarily interested in the family of all twists coprime to the conductor of E and compute a very precise expression for the corresponding 1-level density. In particular, for test functions whose Fourier transforms have sufficiently restricted support, we are able to compute the 1-level density up to an error term that is significantly sharper than the square-root error term predicted by the L-functions Ratios Conjecture.
