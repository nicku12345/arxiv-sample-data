The main conjecture of Iwasawa theory is a conjecture on the relation between a Selmer group and a conjectural p-adic L-function. This conjectural p-adic L-function is expected to satisfy a conjectural functional equation in a certain sense. In view of the main conjecture and this conjectural functional equation, one would expect to have certain algebraic relationship between the Selmer group attached to a Galois representation and the Selmer group attached to the Tate twist of the dual of the Galois representation. It is precisely a component of this algebraic relationship that this paper aims to investigate. Namely, for a given "ordinary" p-adic representation, we compare its Selmer group with the Selmer group of its Tate dual over an admissible p-adic Lie extension, and show that the generalized Iwasawa \mu-invariants associated to the Pontryagin dual of the two said Selmer groups are the same. We should mention that in proving the said equality of the \mu-invariants, we do not assume the main conjecture nor the conjectural functional equation.
