In this paper we prove a special case of the Andr\'e-Oort conjecture for Kuga varieties. If M is a Kuga variety fibred over a pure Shimura variety S as an abelian scheme, and (M_n) is a sequence of special subvarieties in M which are faithfully flat over S, then the Zariski closure of the union of the M_n's is a finite union of special subvarieties faithfully flat over S. The proof is reduced to a variant of the Manin-Mumford conjecture for abelian schemes.
