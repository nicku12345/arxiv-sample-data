We exploit some properties of the Hurwitz zeta function \zeta (n,x) in order to study sums of the form \frac{1}{\pi ^{n}}\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}1/(jk+l)^{n} and \frac{1}{\pi ^{n}}\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}(-1)^{j}/(jk+l)^{n} for % 2\leq n,k\in \mathbb{N}, and integer l\leq k/2. We show that these sums are algebraic numbers. We also show that 1<n\in \mathbb{N} and p\in \mathbb{Q\cap (}0,1\mathbb{)} : the numbers (\zeta (n,p)+(-1)^{n}\zeta (n,1-p))/\pi ^{n} are algebraic. On the way we find polynomials s_{m} and c_{m} of order respectively 2m+1 and 2m+2 such that their n-th coefficients of sine and cosine Fourier transforms are equal to % (-1)^{n}/n^{2m+1} and (-1)^{n}/n^{2m+2} respectively.
