Let E:y^2=x^3+ax+b be an elliptic curve defined over \mathbb{Q}. We compute certain twists of the classical modular curves X(8). Searching for rational points on these twists enables us to find non-trivial pairs of 8-congruent elliptic curves over \mathbb{Q}, i.e. pairs of non-isogenous elliptic curves over \mathbb{Q} whose 8-torsion subgroups are isomorphic as Galois modules. We also show that there are infinitely many examples over \mathbb{Q}.
