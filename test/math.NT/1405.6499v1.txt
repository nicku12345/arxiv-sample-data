We prove a kind of integral expressions for finite multiple harmonic sums and multiple zeta-star values. Moreover, we introduce a class of multiple integrals, associated with some combinatorial data (called 2-labeled posets). This class includes both multiple zeta and zeta-star values of Euler-Zagier type, and also several other types of multiple zeta values. We show that these integrals can be used to obtain some relations among such zeta values quite transparently.
