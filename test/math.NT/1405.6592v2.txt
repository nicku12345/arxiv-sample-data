Let x,h and Q be three parameters. We show that, for most moduli q\le Q and for most positive real numbers y\le x, every reduced arithmetic progression a\mod q has approximately the expected number of primes p from the interval (y,y+h], provided that h>x^{1/6+\epsilon} and Q satisfies appropriate bounds in terms of h and x. Moreover, we prove that, for most moduli q\le Q and for most positive real numbers y\le x, there is at least one prime p\in(y,y+h] lying in every reduced arithmetic progression a\mod q, provided that 1\le Q^2\le h/x^{1/15+\epsilon}.
