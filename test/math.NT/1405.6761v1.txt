For prime levels 5 \le p \le 19, sets of \Gamma_{0}(p)-permuted theta quotients are constructed that generate the graded rings of modular forms of positive integer weight for \Gamma_{1}(p). An explicit formulation of the permutation representation and several applications are given, including a new representation for the number of t-core partitions. The \Gamma_{0}(p)-action induces coefficient symmetries within representations for modular forms and invariance subgroups for coupled systems of differential equations. The symmetry for levels p = 5,7,11 is linked to the Kleinian automorphism groups.
