Letting p vary over all primes and E vary over all elliptic curves over the finite field \mathbb{F}_p, we study the frequency to which a given group G arises as a group of points E(\mathbb{F}_p). It is well-known that the only permissible groups are of the form G_{m,k}:=\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/mk\mathbb{Z}. Given such a candidate group, we let M(G_{m,k}) be the frequency to which the group G_{m,k} arises in this way. Previously, the second and fourth named authors determined an asymptotic formula for M(G_{m,k}) assuming a conjecture about primes in short arithmetic progressions. In this paper, we prove several unconditional bounds for M(G_{m,k}), pointwise and on average. In particular, we show that M(G_{m,k}) is bounded above by a constant multiple of the expected quantity when m\le k^A and that the conjectured asymptotic for M(G_{m,k}) holds for almost all groups G_{m,k} when m\le k^{1/4-\epsilon}. We also apply our methods to study the frequency to which a given integer N arises as the group order \#E(\mathbb{F}_p).
