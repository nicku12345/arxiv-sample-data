For any periodic function f:{\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb C} with period q, we study the Dirichlet series L(s,f):=\sum_{n\geq 1} f(n)/n^s. It is well-known that this admits an analytic continuation to the entire complex plane except at s=1, where it has a simple pole with residue \rho:= q^{-1}\sum_{1\leq a\leq q} f(a). Thus, the function is analytic at s=1 when \rho=0 and in this case, we study its non-vanishing using the theory of linear forms in logarithms and Dirichlet L-series. In this way, we give new proofs of an old criterion of Okada for the non-vanishing of L(1,f) as well as a classical theorem of Baker, Birch and Wirsing. We also give some new necessary and sufficient conditions for the non-vanishing of L(1,f).
