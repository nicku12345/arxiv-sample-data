In this article, first we generalize the Rudin-Shapiro sequence by means of counting digit pattern. Next show that, if the generalized Rudin-Shapiro sequence is not periodic, then no arithmetic subsequence of the generalized Rudin-Shapiro sequence is periodic. We give the simultaneous recursively word definition of the generalized Rudin-Shapiro sequence. We apply the transcendence measures criterion established by Adamczewski-Bugeaud [AB2] to find that, the series generated by an arithmetic subsequence of the non-periodic generalized Rudin-Shapiro sequence gives a Liouville number or an S-number or T-number. We also define two infinite matrix products from the simultaneous recursively word definition of the generalized Rudin-Shapiro sequence. We can regard the two infinite matrix products as generalizations of the infinite product studied in [AmV1], [AmV2], [Ta]. We study the transcendence of the power series generated by the two infinite matrix products by using the generalized Rudin-Shapiro sequence's properties.
