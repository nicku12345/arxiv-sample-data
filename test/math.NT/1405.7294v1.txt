Let E be a semistable elliptic curve over \mathbb{Q}. We prove that if E has non-split multiplicative reduction at at least one odd prime or split multiplicative reduction at at least two odd primes and if the rank of E(\mathbb{Q}) is one and the Tate-Shafarevich group of E has finite order, then \mathrm{ord}_{s=1}L(E,s)=1. We also prove the corresponding result for the abelian variety associated with a weight two newform f of trivial character. These, and other related results, are consequences of our main theorem, which establishes criteria for f and H^1_f(\mathbb{Q},V), where V is the p-adic Galois representation associated with f, that ensure that \mathrm{ord}_{s=1}L(f,s)=1. The main theorem is proved using the Iwasawa theory of V over an imaginary quadratic field to show that the p-adic logarithm of a suitable Heegner point is non-zero.
