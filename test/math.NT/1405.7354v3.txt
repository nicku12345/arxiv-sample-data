Let F be a function in the Selberg class {\mathcal S} and a be a real number not equal to 1/2. Consider the sum \lambda_{F}(n,a)=\sum_{\rho}\left[1-\left(\frac{\rho-a}{\rho+a-1}\right)^{n}\right], where \rho runs over the non-trivial zeros of F. In this paper, we prove that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the positivity of the "modified Li coefficient" \lambda_{F}(n,a), for n=1,2,.. and a<1/2. Furthermore, we give an explicit arithmetic and asymptotic formula of these coefficients.
