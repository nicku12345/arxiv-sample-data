We construct some n-dimensional eigenvarieties for finite slope overconvergent eigenforms over some unitary Shimura varieties with signature (1,n-1)\times(0,n)\times\cdots\times(0,n) by adapting Andreatta-Iovita-Pilloni's method. We also show that there are some Galois pseudo-characters over our eigenvarieties by studying analytic continuation of finite slope eigenforms over these Shimura varieties.
