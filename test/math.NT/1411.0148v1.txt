The functional equation for nonarchimedean Rankin-Selberg local Euler factors was proved by Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika in 1983. In this expository note we translate the original proof into the purely functorial language of parabolic induction-restriction of Bernstein-Zelevinsky. This new language gives a clearer presentation of the ideas, and works over arbitrary fields with characteristic not equal to the residue characteristic.
