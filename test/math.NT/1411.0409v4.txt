We propose to generalize the work of R\'egis Dupont for computing modular polynomials in dimension 2 to new invariants. We describe an algorithm to compute modular polynomials for invariants derived from theta constants and prove under some heuristics that this algorithm is quasi-linear in its output size. Some properties of the modular polynomials defined from quotients of theta constants are analyzed. We report on experiments with our implementation.
