While studying a characteristic number of manifolds we noticed that the calculation was simply computing a multiple of a multinomial coefficient. We were, at the time, interested in computing the greatest common divisor of these characteristic numbers, and from that came this fun and interesting number theory problem. In this short paper, I will give the answer to this problem, which gives the greatest common divisor of certain multinomial coefficients.
