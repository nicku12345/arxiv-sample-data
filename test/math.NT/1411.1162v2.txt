For an imaginary quadratic field k of class number >1, Jordan proved that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of rational indefinite quaternion division algebras B such that the associated Shimura curve M^B has k-rational points and k splits B. In this article, we study the case where k does not split B, and obtain a complementary result. In other words, the main result of this article asserts that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of B such that M^B has k-rational points.
