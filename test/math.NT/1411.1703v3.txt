Let A be an absolutely simple abelian variety without (potential) complex multiplication, defined over the number field K. Suppose that either \dim A=2 or A is of \operatorname{GL}_2-type: we give an explicit bound \ell_0(A,K) such that, for every prime \ell>\ell_0(A,K), the image of the absolute Galois group of K in \operatorname{Aut}(T_\ell(A)) is as large as it is allowed to be by endomorphisms and polarizations.
