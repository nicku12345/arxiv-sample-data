Using a recent improvement by Bettin and Chandee to a bound of Duke, Friedlander and Iwaniec~(1997) on double exponential sums with Kloosterman fractions, we establish a uniformity of distribution result for the fractional parts of Dedekind sums s(m,n) with m and n running over rather general sets. Our result extends earlier work of Myerson (1988) and Vardi (1987). Using different techniques, we also study the least denominator of the collection of Dedekind sums \bigl\{s(m,n):m\in(\mathbb Z/n \mathbb Z)^*\bigr\} on average for n\in[1,N].
