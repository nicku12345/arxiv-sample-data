Let \pi be a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation for GL(n) over a number field. We establish upper bounds on the number of Hecke eigenvalues of \pi equal to a fixed complex number. For GL(2), we also determine upper bounds on the number of Hecke eigenvalues with absolute value equal to a fixed number \gamma; in the case \gamma=0, this answers a question of Serre. These bounds are then improved upon by restricting to non-dihedral representations. Finally, we obtain analogous bounds for a family of cuspidal automorphic representations for GL(3).
