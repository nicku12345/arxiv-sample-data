De Bruijn and Newman introduced a deformation of the completed Riemann zeta function \zeta, and proved there is a real constant \Lambda which encodes the movement of the nontrivial zeros of \zeta under the deformation. The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the assertion that \Lambda\leq 0. Newman, however, conjectured that \Lambda\geq 0, remarking, "the new conjecture is a quantitative version of the dictum that the Riemann hypothesis, if true, is only barely so." Andrade, Chang and Miller extended the machinery developed by Newman and Polya to L-functions for function fields. In this setting we must consider a modified Newman's conjecture: \sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}} \Lambda_f \geq 0, for \mathcal{F} a family of L-functions.   We extend their results by proving this modified Newman's conjecture for several families of L-functions. In contrast with previous work, we are able to exhibit specific L-functions for which \Lambda_D = 0, and thereby prove a stronger statement: \max_{L\in\mathcal{F}} \Lambda_L = 0. Using geometric techniques, we show a certain deformed L-function must have a double root, which implies \Lambda = 0. For a different family, we construct particular elliptic curves with p + 1 points over \mathbb{F}_p. By the Weil conjectures, this has either the maximum or minimum possible number of points over \mathbb{F}_{p^{2n}}. The fact that #E(\mathbb{F}_{p^{2n}}) attains the bound tells us that the associated L-function satisfies \Lambda = 0.
