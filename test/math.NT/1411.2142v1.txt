We propose an algebraic and a geometric classification of euclidean isodual lattices of fixed rank. First, we prove that these lattices are distribued according to a finite number of algebraic types. Second, we show that they are parametrized by a finite number of symmetric spaces associated to the classical groups {\bf SO}_0(p,q), {\bf Sp}(2g,{\bf R}) and {\bf SU}(p,q). We obtain a complete discription of algebraic types and Gram matrices of isodual lattices up to rank 7. The maximal density problem is also discussed.
