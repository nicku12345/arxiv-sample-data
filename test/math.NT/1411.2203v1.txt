We proved recently (see \cite{lhgarasu}) the result on the title for odd prime divisors of such an n. The result implies for many n's, more precisely, for an infinity of n's with an arbitrary fixed number of prime divisors, the inexistence of circulant Hadamard matrices, and the inexistence of Barker sequences of length n >13. The proof used a result of Arasu. It turns out that there is another, shorter proof, of the more general result that includes the prime p=2. This new proof is based on a result of Brock (see \cite[Theorem 3.1]{brock}), and besides that, requires just the definition of the Fourier transform. I noticed Brock's result in a preprint (see \cite{winterhofetal}) of Winterhof et al. where it is used to study the inexistence of related Butson-Hadamard matrices.
