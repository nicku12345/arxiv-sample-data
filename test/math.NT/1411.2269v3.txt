Let R be a commutative ring, f \in R[X_1,\ldots,X_k] a multivariate polynomial, and G a finite subgroup of the group of units of R satisfying a certain constraint, which always holds if R is a field. Then, we evaluate \sum f(x_1,\ldots,x_k), where the summation is taken over all pairwise distinct x_1,\ldots,x_k \in G. In particular, let p^s be a power of an odd prime, n a positive integer coprime with p-1, and a_1,\ldots,a_k integers such that \varphi(p^s) divides a_1+\cdots+a_k and p-1 does not divide \sum_{i \in I}a_i for all non-empty proper subsets I\subseteq \{1,\ldots,k\}; then  \sum x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_k^{a_k} \equiv \frac{\varphi(p^s)}{\mathrm{gcd}(n,\varphi(p^s))}(-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! \,\,\bmod{p^s},  where the summation is taken over all pairwise distinct n-th residues x_1,\ldots,x_k modulo p^s coprime with p.
