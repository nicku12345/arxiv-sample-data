We study the integral points on \mathbb P_ n\setminus D, where D is the branch locus of a projection from an hypersurface in \mathbb P_{n+1} to a hyperplane H\simeq\mathbb P_n. In doing that we follow the approach proposed in a paper by Zannier but we prove a more general result that also gives a sharper bound that may lead to prove the finiteness of integral points and has more applications. The proofs we present in this paper are effective and they provide a way to actually construct a set containing all the integral points in question. Our results find a concrete application to Diophantine equations, more specifically to the problem of finding integral solutions to equations F(x_0,\dots,x_n)=c, where c is a given nonzero value and F is a homogeneous form defining the branch locus D.
