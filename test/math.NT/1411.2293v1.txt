Maier and Rassias computed the moments and proved a distribution result for the cotangent sum c_0(a/q):=-\sum_{m<q}\frac mq\cot(\frac{\pi ma}{q}) on average over 1/2<A_0\leq a/q<A_1<1, as q\rightarrow \infty. We give a simple argument that recovers their results (with stronger error terms) and extends them to the full range 1\leq a<q. Moreover, we give a density result for c_0 and answer a question posed by Maier and Rassias on the growth of the moments of c_0.
