We prove the compatibility of local and global Langlands correspondences for GL_n up to semisimplification for the Galois representations constructed by Harris-Lan-Taylor-Thorne and Scholze. More precisely, let r_p(\pi) denote an n-dimensional p-adic representation of the Galois group of a CM field F attached to a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representation \pi of GL_n(\mathbb{A}_F). We show that the restriction of r_p(\pi) to the decomposition group of a place v\nmid p of F corresponds up to semisimplification to rec(\pi_v), the image of \pi_v under the local Langlands correspondence. Furthermore, we can show that the monodromy of the associated Weil-Deligne representation of .r_p(\pi)|_{G_{F_v}} is `more nilpotent' than the monodromy of rec(\pi_v).
