We study torsion subgroups of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM) defined over number fields which admit a real embedding. We give a complete classification of the groups which arise up to isomorphism as the torsion subgroup of a CM elliptic curve defined over a number field of odd degree: there are infinitely many. Restricting to the case of prime degree, we show that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes. More precisely, there are six "Olson groups" which arise as torsion subgroups of CM elliptic curves over number fields of every degree, and there are precisely 17 "non-Olson" CM elliptic curves defined over a prime degree number field.
