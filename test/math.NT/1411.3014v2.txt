The aim of this note is to provide an upper bound of the number of positive integers \le x which can be written as \varphi(n) for some positive integer n, where \varphi stands for the Euler's function. The order of magnitude of this estimate, which is roughly x/\sqrt[4]{\ln x}, implies that the set of Euler's values contains arbitrarily large gaps.
