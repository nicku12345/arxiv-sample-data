In this paper we will explore the solutions to the diophantine equation in the Erd\H{o}s-Straus conjecture. For a prime p we are discussing the relationship between the values x,y,z \in \mathbb{N} so that  \frac{4}{p} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z}.   We will separate the types of solutions into two cases. In particular we will argue that the most common relationship found is  x = \lfloor \frac{py}{4y-p} \rfloor + 1.   Finally, we will make a few conjectures to motivate further research in this area.
