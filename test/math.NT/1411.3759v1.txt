We prove that the universal unramified deformation ring R^{\mathrm{unr}} of a continuous Galois representation \overline{\rho}: G_{F^{+}} \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_n(k) (for a totally real field F^{+} and finite field k) is finite over \mathcal{O} = W(k) in many cases. We also prove (under similar hypotheses) that the universal deformation ring R^{\mathrm{univ}} is finite over the local deformation ring R^{\mathrm{loc}}.
