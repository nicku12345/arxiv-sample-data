We introduce the inversion polynomial for Dedekind sums f_b(x)=\sum x^{\operatorname{inv}(a,b)} to study the number of s(a,b) which have the same value for given b. We prove several properties of this polynomial and present some conjectures. We also introduce connections between Kloosterman sums and the inversion polynomial evaluated at particular roots of unity. Finally, we improve on previously known bounds for the second highest value of the Dedekind sum and provide a conjecture for a possible generalization. Lastly, we include a new restriction on equal Dedekind sums based on the reciprocity formula.
