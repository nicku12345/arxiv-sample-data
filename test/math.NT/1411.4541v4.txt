Luo has proven an optimal upper bound for the L^4-norm of dihedral Maass forms of large eigenvalue, by bounding a mean value of triple product L-functions. Motivated by this result, we study a mean value of L-functions having similar shape, and obtain for it an asymptotic with power savings. Our work may be helpful in eventually obtaining an asymptotic for the L^4-norm.
