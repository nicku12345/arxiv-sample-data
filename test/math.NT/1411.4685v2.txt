Let E/\mathbb{Q} be an elliptic curve, p a prime and K_{\infty}/K the anticyclotomic \mathbb{Z}_p-extension of a quadratic imaginary field K satisfying the Heegner hypothesis. In this paper we give a new proof to a theorem of Bertolini which determines the value of the \Lambda-corank of \text{Sel}(E/K_{\infty}) in the case where E has ordinary reduction at p. In the case where E has supersingular reduction at p we make a conjecture about the structure of the module of Heegner points mod p. Assuming this conjecture we give a new proof to a theorem of Ciperiani which determines the value of the \Lambda-corank of \text{Sel}(E/K_{\infty}) in the case where E has supersingular reduction at p.
