The \boldsymbol{p}-adic diaphony as introduced by Hellekalek is a quantitative measure for the irregularity of distribution of a sequence in the unit cube. In this paper we show how this notion of diaphony can be interpreted as worst-case integration error in a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our main result is an upper bound on the \boldsymbol{p}-adic diaphony of the Halton sequence.
