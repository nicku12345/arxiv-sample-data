Let Q(x,y,z) be an integral quadratic form with determinant coprime to some modulus q. We show that q\mid Q for some non-zero integer vector (x,y,z) of length O(q^{5/8+\varepsilon}), for any fixed \varepsilon>0. Without the coprimality condition on the determinant one could not achieve an exponent below 2/3. The proof uses a bound for short character sums involving binary quadratic forms, which extends a result of Chang.
