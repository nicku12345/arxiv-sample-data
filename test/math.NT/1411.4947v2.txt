We study Galois descents for categories of mixed Tate motives over \mathcal{O}_{N}[1/N], for N\in \left\{2, 3, 4, 8\right\} or \mathcal{O}_{N} for N=6, with \mathcal{O}_{N} the ring of integers of the N^{\text{th}} cyclotomic field, and construct families of motivic iterated integrals with prescribed properties. In particular this gives a basis of honorary multiple zeta values (linear combinations of iterated integrals at roots of unity \mu_{N} which are multiple zeta values). It also gives a new proof, via Goncharov's coproduct, of Deligne's results: the category of mixed Tate motives over \mathcal{O}_{k_{N}}[1/N], for N\in \left\{2, 3, 4,8\right\} is spanned by the motivic fundamental groupoid of \mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus\left\{0,\mu_{N},\infty \right\} with an explicit basis. By applying the period map, we obtain a generating family for multiple zeta values relative to \mu_{N}.
