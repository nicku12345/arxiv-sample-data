The purpose of this article is to give an explicit description, in terms of hypergeometric functions over finite fields, of zeta function of a certain type of smooth hypersurfaces that generalizes Dwork family. The point here is that we count the number of rational points employing both character sums and the theory of weights, which enables us to enlighten the calculation of the zeta function.
