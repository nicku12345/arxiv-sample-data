By focusing on the family E:y^2=x^3+a, we present strategies for determining the structure of the torsion subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve, E(K), over quadratic field K. Generalizations of the Nagell-Lutz theorem and Mazur's theorem to curves defined over quadratic fields allows us to determine the full torsion subgroup of E(K) as one of at most three possibilities when a is a square.
