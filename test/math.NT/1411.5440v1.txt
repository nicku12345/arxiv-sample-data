We discuss how one could study asymptotics of cyclotomic quantities via the mean values of certain multiplicative functions and their Dirichlet series using a theorem of Delange. We show how this could provide a new approach to Artin's conjecture on primitive roots. We focus on whether a fixed prime has a certain order modulo infinitely many other primes. We also give an estimate for the mean value of one such Dirichlet series.
