Let k be even. We consider two series F_k(x)= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sigma_{k-1}(n)}{n^{k+1}} \sin(2\pi n x) and G_k(x)= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sigma_{k-1}(n)}{n^{k+1}} \cos(2\pi n x), where \sigma_{k-1} is the divisor function. They converge on \mathbb{R} to continuous functions. In this paper, we examine the differentiability of F_k and G_k. These functions are related to Eisenstein series and their (quasi-)modular properties allow us to apply the method proposed by Itatsu in 1981 in the study of the Riemann series. We focus on the case k=2 and we show that the sine series exhibits different behaviour with respect to differentiability than the cosine series. We prove that the differentiability of F_2 at an irrational x is related to the fine diophantine properties of x. We estimate the modulus of continuity of F_2. We formulate a conjecture concerning differentiability of F_k and G_k for any k even.
