Let X be a complete smooth variety defined over number field K and i an integer. The absolute Galois group of K acts on the ith l-adic etale cohomology of X for all l, producing a system of l-adic representations \{\Phi_l\}. The conjectures of Grothendieck, Tate, and Mumford-Tate predict that the identity component of the algebraic monodromy group of \Phi_\ell admits a common reductive Q-form for all l if X is projective. Denote by \Gamma_l and G_l respectively the monodromy group and the algebraic monodromy group of \Phi_l^{ss}, the semisimplification of \Phi_\ell. Assuming that G_{l_0} satisfies a group theoretic condition for some prime l_0 (Hypothesis A), we construct a connected quasi-split Q-reductive group G_Q which is a common Q-form of G_l^\circ for all sufficiently large l. Let G_Q^{sc} be the universal cover of the derived group of G_Q. As an application, we prove that the monodromy group \Gamma_\ell is big in the sense that \Gamma_\ell^{sc}\cong G_Q^{sc}(Z_l) for all sufficiently large l.
