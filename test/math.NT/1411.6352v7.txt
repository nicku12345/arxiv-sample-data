In this paper we prove the \pm-main conjecture of Iwasawa theory formulated by Kobayashi for elliptic curves with supersingular reduction at an odd prime p such that a_p=0, using a key new observation that it can be reduced to another Iwasawa-Greenberg main conjecture, which is more accessible and proved here as a first step. Then we develop some generalized \pm local theory and deduce the main conjecture. The argument uses in an essential way the recent study on explicit reciprocity law for Beilinson-Flach elements by Kings-Loeffler-Zerbes. We also prove as corollaries the p-part of the BSD formula at supersingular primes when the analytic rank is 0 or 1. The main result enables us to present in the Appendix a number of explicit infinite families of elliptic curves without complex multiplications for which we can now prove the full Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. No such infinite families of curves without complex multiplication were known previously.
