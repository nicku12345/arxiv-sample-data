The smallest non-abelian p-groups play a fundamental role in the theory of Galois p-extensions. We illustrate this by highlighting their role in the definition of the norm residue map in Galois cohomology. We then determine how often these groups --- as well as other closely related, larger p-groups --- occur as Galois groups over given base fields. We show further how the appearance of some Galois groups forces the appearance of other Galois groups in an interesting way.
