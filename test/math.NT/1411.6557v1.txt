In this note, we construct explicit bases for spaces of overconvergent p-adic modular forms when p=2,3 and study their stability under the Atkin operator. The resulting extension of the algorithms of Lauder is illustrated with computations of slope sequences of some 2-adic eigencurves and the construction of Chow-Heegner points on elliptic curves via special values of Rankin triple product L-functions.
