We construct the compatible system of l-adic representations associated to a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_n over a CM (or totally real) field and check local-global compatibility for the l-adic representation away from l and finite number of rational primes above which the CM field or the automorphic representation ramify. The main innovation is that we impose no self-duality hypothesis on the automorphic representation.
