Let \mathbb F_q be a finite field, F/\mathbb F_q be a function field of genus g having full constant field \mathbb F_q, \mathcal S a set of places of F and H the holomorphy ring of \mathcal S. In this paper we compute the density of coprime m-tuples of elements of H. As a side result, we obtain that whenever the complement of \mathcal S is finite, the computation of the density can be reduced to the computation of the L-polynomial of the function field. In the rational function field case, classical results for the density of coprime m-tuples of polynomials are obtained as corollaries.
