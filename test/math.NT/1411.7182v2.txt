Let X be a smooth variety over a perfect field of characteristic p>0. In this small note we define overconvergent F-de Rham-Witt connections as an analogue for F-crystals over proper schemes. We prove that the forgetful functor from the category of overconvergent F-de Rham-Witt connections to the category of convergent F-de Rham-Witt connections is fully faithful. The argument is an analogue of a discussion by Kedlaya on full faithfulness of overconvergent F-isocrystals.}
