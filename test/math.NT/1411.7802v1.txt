The SL(3) Kuznetsov formula exists in several versions, and has been employed with some success to study automorphic forms on SL(3). In each version, the weight functions on the geometric side are given by multiple integrals with complicated oscillating factors; this is the primary obstruction to its use. By describing them as solutions to systems of differential equations, we give power series and Mellin-Barnes integral representations of minimal dimension for these weight functions. This completes the role of harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces on the geometric side of the Kuznetsov formula, so that further study may be done through classical analytic techniques.
