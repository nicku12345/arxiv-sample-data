We consider several families of palintiples (also known as reverse multiples) whose carries themselves are digits of lower-base palintiples and give some methods for constructing them from fundamental palintiple types. We also continue the study of palinomials introduced in an earlier paper by revealing a more direct relationship between the digits of certain palintiple types and the roots of their palinomials. We explore the consequences of this relationship for palinomials induced by palintiple families derived from lower-base palintiples. Finally, we pose some questions regarding Young graphs of derived palintiple families and consider the implications our general observations might have for relations between Young graph isomorphism classes.
