We obtain new results about the representation of almost all residues modulo a prime p by a product of a small integer and also an element of small multiplicative subgroup of ({\mathbb Z}/p{\mathbb Z})^*. These results are based on some ideas, and their modifications, of a recent work of J. Cilleruelo and M. Z. Garaev (2014),
