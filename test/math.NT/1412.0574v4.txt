Let t \in \mathbb{N}, \eta >0. Suppose that x is a sufficiently large real number and q is a natural number with q \leq x^{5/12-\eta}, q not a multiple of the conductor of the exceptional character \chi^* (if it exists). Suppose further that, \[ \max \{p : p | q \} < \exp (\frac{\log x}{C \log \log x}) \; \; {and} \; \; \prod_{p | q} p < x^{\delta}, \] where C and \delta are suitable positive constants depending on t and \eta. Let a \in \mathbb{Z}, (a,q)=1 and \[ \mathcal{A} = \{n \in (x/2, x]: n \equiv a \pmod{q} \} . \] We prove that there are primes p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_t in \mathcal{A} with \[ p_t - p_1 \ll qt \exp (\frac{40 t}{9-20 \theta}) . \] Here \theta = (\log q) / \log x.
