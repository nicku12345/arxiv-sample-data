In this paper we prove that the p-adic L-function that interpolates the Rankin-Selberg product of a general weight two modular form which is unramified and non-ordinary at p, and an ordinary CM form of higher weight contains the characteristic ideal of the corresponding Selmer group. This is one divisibility of the Iwasawa-Greenberg main conjecture for the p-adic L-function. This generalizes an earlier work of the author to the non-ordinary case. The result of this paper plays a crucial role in the proof of Iwasawa main conjecture and refined Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer formula for supersingular elliptic curves.
