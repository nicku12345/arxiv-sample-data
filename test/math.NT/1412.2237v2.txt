Let \mu(n) be the M\"obius function, e(z) = \exp(2\pi iz), x real and 2\leq y \leq x. This paper proves two sequences (\mu(n)) and (e(n^k \alpha)) are strongly orthogonal in short intervals. That is, if k \geq 3 being fixed and y\geq x^{1-1/4+\varepsilon}, then for any A>0, we have \[   \sum_{x< n \leq x+y} \mu(n) e\left(n^k \alpha \right) \ll y(\log y)^{-A} \] uniformly for \alpha \in \mathbb{R}.
