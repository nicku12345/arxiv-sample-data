Let E be an optimal elliptic curve defined over \mathbb{Q}. The critical subgroup of E is defined by Mazur and Swinnerton-Dyer as the subgroup of E(\mathbb{Q}) generated by traces of branch points under a modular parametrization of E. We prove that for all rank two elliptic curves with conductor smaller than 1000, the critical subgroup is torsion. First, we define a family of critical polynomials attached to E and describe two algorithms to compute such polynomials. We then give a sufficient condition for the critical subgroup to be torsion in terms of the factorization of critical polynomials. Finally, a table of critical polynomials is obtained for all elliptic curves of rank two and conductor smaller than 1000, from which we deduce our result.
