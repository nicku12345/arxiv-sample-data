The Burgess inequality is the best upper bound we have for the character sum S_{\chi}(M,N) = \sum_{M<n\le M+N} \chi(n). Until recently, no explicit estimates had been given for the inequality. In 2006, Booker gave an explicit estimate for quadratic characters which he used to calculate the class number of a 32-digit discriminant. McGown used an explicit estimate to show that there are no norm-Euclidean Galois cubic fields with discriminant greater than 10^{140}. Both of their explicit estimates are on restricted ranges. In this paper we prove an explicit estimate that works for any M and N. We also improve McGown's estimates in a slightly narrower range, getting explicit estimates for characters of any order. We apply the estimates to the question of how large must a prime p be to ensure that there is a k-th power non-residue less than p^{1/6}.
