Using an extension of the abundancy index to imaginary quadratic rings with unique factorization, we define what we call n-powerfully perfect numbers in these rings. This definition serves to extend the concept of perfect numbers that have been defined and studied in the integers. We investigate the properties of 2-powerfully perfect numbers in the rings \mathcal O_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})}, \mathcal O_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2})}, and \mathcal O_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-7})}, the three imaginary quadratic rings with unique factorization in which 2 is not a prime.
