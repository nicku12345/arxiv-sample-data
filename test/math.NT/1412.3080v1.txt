For each positive integer r, let S_r denote the r^{th} Schemmel totient function, a multiplicative arithmetic function defined by \[S_r(p^{\alpha})=\begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if } p\leq r; \\ p^{\alpha-1}(p-r), & \mbox{if } p>r \end{cases}\] for all primes p and positive integers \alpha. The function S_1 is simply Euler's totient function \phi. Masser and Shiu have established several fascinating results concerning sparsely totient numbers, positive integers n satisfying \phi(n)<\phi(m) for all integers m>n. We define a sparsely Schemmel totient number of order r to be a positive integer n such that S_r(n)>0 and S_r(n)<S_r(m) for all m>n with S_r(m)>0. We then generalize some of the results of Masser and Shiu.
