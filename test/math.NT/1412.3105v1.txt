A unitary divisor c of a positive integer n is a positive divisor of n that is relatively prime to \displaystyle{\frac{n}{c}}. For any integer k, the function \sigma_k^* is a multiplicative arithmetic function defined so that \sigma_k^*(n) is the sum of the k^{th} powers of the unitary divisors of n. We provide analogues of the functions \sigma_k^* in imaginary quadratic rings that are unique factorization domains. We then explore properties of what we call n-powerfully unitarily t-perfect numbers, analogues of the unitary multiperfect numbers that have been defined and studied in the integers. We end with a list of several opportunities for further research.
