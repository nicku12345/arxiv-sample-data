Let {\mathbb K}={\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{m}) be a real quadratic number field, where m>1 is a squarefree integer. Suppose that 0 < \theta< \pi  has rational cosine, say \cos (\theta)=s/r with 0< |s|<r and \gcd(r,s)=1. A positive integer n is called a (\mathbb K,\theta)-congruent number if there is a triangle, called the (\mathbb K,\theta, n)-triangles, with sides in \mathbb K having \theta as an angle and n\alpha_\theta as area, where {\alpha_\theta}=\sqrt{r^2-s^2}. Consider the (\mathbb K,\theta)-congruent number elliptic curve E_{n,\theta}: y^2=x(x+(r+s)n)(x-(r-s)n) defined over \mathbb K. Denote the squarefree part of positive integer t by {\rm sqf}(t). In this work, it is proved that if m\neq {\rm sqf}(2r(r-s)) and mn\neq 2, 3, 6, then n is a (\mathbb K,\theta)-congruent number if and only if the Mordell-Weil group E_{n,\theta}(\mathbb K) has positive rank, and all of the (\mathbb K,\theta, n)-triangles are classified in four types.
