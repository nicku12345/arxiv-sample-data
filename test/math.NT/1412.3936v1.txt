For K a cubic field with only one real embedding and \alpha,\beta\in K, we show how to construct an increasing sequence \{m_n\} of positive integers and a subsequence \{\psi_n\} such that (for some constructible constants C_1,C_2>0) \max\{\|m_n\alpha\|,\|m_n\beta\|\}<\frac{C_1}{m_n^{1/2}} and \|\psi_n\alpha\|<\frac{C_2}{\psi_n^{1/2}\log \psi_n} for all n. As a consequence, we have \psi_n\|\psi_n\alpha\|\|\psi_n\beta\|<\frac{C_1 C_2}{\log \psi_n}, thus giving an effective proof of Littlewood's conjecture for the pair (\alpha,\beta). Our proofs are elementary and use only standard results from algebraic number theory and the theory of continued fractions.
