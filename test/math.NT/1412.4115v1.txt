We shall present effective approximations measures for certain infinite products related to q-exponential function. There are two main targets. First we shall prove an explicit irrationality measure result for the values of q-exponential function at rational points. Then, if we restrict the approximations to rational numbers of the shape d^s/N, we may replace Bundschuh's irrationality exponent 7/3 by 2+\frac{1}{3+2\sqrt 3}=2.1547....
