We prove a p-adic Labesse-Langlands transfer from the group of units in a definite quaternion algebra to its subgroup of norm one elements. More precisely, given an eigenvariety for the first group, we show that there exists an eigenvariety for the second group and a morphism between them that extends the classical Langlands transfer. In order to find a suitable target eigenvariety for the transfer we formalise a notion of Langlands compatibility of tame levels. Proving the existence of Langlands compatible tame levels is the key to pass from the classical transfer on the level of L-packets to a map between classical points of eigenvarieties, which is then amenable for interpolation to give the p-adic transfer.
