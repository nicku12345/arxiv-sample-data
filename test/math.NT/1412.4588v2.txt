We evaluate the action of Hecke operators on Siegel Eisenstein series of arbitrary degree, level and character. For square-free level, we simultaneously diagonalise the space with respect to all the Hecke operators, computing the eigenvalues explicitly, and obtain a multiplicity-one result. For arbitrary level, we simultaneously diagonalise the space with respect to the Hecke operators attached to primes not dividing the level, again computing the eigenvalues explicitly.
