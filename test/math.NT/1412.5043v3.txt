We generalize the concept of reduced Arakelov divisors and define C-reduced divisors for a given number C \geq 1. These C-reduced divisors have remarkable properties which are similar to the properties of reduced ones. In this paper, we describe an algorithm to test whether an Arakelov divisor of a real quadratic field F is C-reduced in time polynomial in \log|\Delta_F| with \Delta_F the discriminant of F. Moreover, we give an example of a cubic field for which our algorithm does not work.
