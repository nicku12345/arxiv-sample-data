In this work we present a natural generalization of strong pseudoprime to base b, which we have called q-pseudoprime to base b. It allows us to present another way to define a Midy's number to base b (overpseudoprime to base b). Besides, we count the bases b such that N is a q-probable prime base b and those ones such that N is a Midy's number to base b. Furthemore, we prove that there is not a concept analogous to Carmichael numbers to q-probable prime to base b as with the concept of strong pseudoprimes to base b.
