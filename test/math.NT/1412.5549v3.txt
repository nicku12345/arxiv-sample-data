Let \bf{G} be the connected reductive group of type E_{7,3} over \mathbb{Q} and \mathfrak{T} be the corresponding symmetric domain in \mathbb{C}^{27}. Let \Gamma=\bf{G}(\mathbb{Z}) be the arithmetic subgroup defined by Baily. In this paper, for any positive integer k\ge 10, we will construct a (non-zero) holomorphic cusp form on \mathfrak{T} of weight 2k with respect to \Gamma from a Hecke cusp form in S_{2k-8}(SL_2(\mathbb{Z})). This lift is an analogue of Ikeda's construction.
