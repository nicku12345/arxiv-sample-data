We prove in some cases a formula for the Greenberg-Benois \mathcal{L}-invariant of the spin, standard and adjoint Galois representations associated with Siegel-Hilbert modular forms. In order to simplify the calculation, we give a new definition of the \mathcal{L}-invariant for a Galois representation V of a number field F\neq \mathbb{Q}; we also check that it is compatible with Benois' definition for \mathrm{Ind}_F^{\mathbb{Q}}(V).
