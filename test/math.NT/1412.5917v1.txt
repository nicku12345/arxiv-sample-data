We develop certain aspects of the theory of shifted multiple Dirichlet series and study their meromorphic continuations. These continuations are used to obtain explicit spectral first and second moments of Rankin-Selberg convolutions. One consequence is a Weyl type estimate for the Rankin-Selberg convolution of a holomorphic cusp form and a Maass form with spectral parameter |t_j|\le T, namely:    \left| L\left(\frac{1}{2}+ir, f\times u_j\right) \right|   \ll_N T^{2/3+\epsilon},  uniformly, for |r| \le T^{2/3}, with the implied constant depending only on f and the level N.
