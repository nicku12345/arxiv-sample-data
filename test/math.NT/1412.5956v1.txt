We prove the exponent 4/3 for the lattice point discrepancy of a torus in \mathbb{R}^3 (generated by the rotation of a circle around the z axis). The exponent comes from a diagonal term and it seems a natural limit for any approach based solely on classical methods of exponential sums. The result extends to other solids in \mathbb{R}^3 related to the torus.
