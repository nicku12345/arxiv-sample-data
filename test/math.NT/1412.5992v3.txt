A theorem of Kurzweil ('55) on inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation states that if \theta is an irrational number, then the following are equivalent: (A) for every decreasing positive function \psi such that \sum_{q = 1}^\infty \psi(q) = \infty, and for almost every s\in\mathbb R, there exist infinitely many q\in\mathbb N such that \|q\theta - s\| < \psi(q), and (B) \theta is badly approximable. This theorem is not true if one adds to condition (A) the hypothesis that the function q\mapsto q\psi(q) is decreasing. In this paper we find a condition on the continued fraction expansion of \theta which is equivalent to the modified version of condition (A). This expands on a recent paper of D. H. Kim ('14).
