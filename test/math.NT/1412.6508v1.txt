A simple geometric construction on the moduli spaces \mathcal{M}_{0,n} of curves of genus 0 with n ordered marked points is described which gives a common framework for many irrationality proofs for zeta values. This construction yields Ap\'ery's approximations to \zeta(2) and \zeta(3), and for larger n, an infinite family of small linear forms in multiple zeta values with an interesting algebraic structure. It also contains a generalisation of the linear forms used by Ball and Rivoal to prove that infinitely many odd zeta values are irrational.
