The aim of this paper is to show lifts from pairs of two elliptic modular forms to Siegel modular forms of half-integral weight of even degree under the assumption that the constructed Siegel modular form is not identically zero. The key of the proof is to introduce a certain generalization of the Maass relation for Siegel modular forms of half-integral weight of general degree.
