We prove connections between Zeckendorf decompositions and Benford's law. Recall that if we define the Fibonacci numbers by F_1 = 1, F_2 = 2 and F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}, every positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of non-adjacent elements of this sequence; this is called the Zeckendorf decomposition, and similar unique decompositions exist for sequences arising from recurrence relations of the form G_{n+1}=c_1G_n+\cdots+c_LG_{n+1-L} with c_i positive and some other restrictions. Additionally, a set S \subset \mathbb{Z} is said to satisfy Benford's law base 10 if the density of the elements in S with leading digit d is \log_{10}{(1+\frac{1}{d})}; in other words, smaller leading digits are more likely to occur. We prove that as n\to\infty for a randomly selected integer m in [0, G_{n+1}) the distribution of the leading digits of the summands in its generalized Zeckendorf decomposition converges to Benford's law almost surely. Our results hold more generally: one obtains similar theorems to those regarding the distribution of leading digits when considering how often values in sets with density are attained in the summands in the decompositions.
