This paper is devoted to abelian varieties arising from generalized Legendre curves. In particular, we consider their corresponding Galois representations, periods, and endomorphism algebras. For certain one parameter families of 2-dimensional abelian varieties of this kind, we determine when the endomorphism algebra of each fiber defined over the algebraic closure of \Bbb Q contains a quaternion algebra.
