In this paper, we study algebraic and analytic properties of Fourier coefficients, expressed as q-series, of the so-called Bloch-Okounkov n-point function. We prove several results about these series and explain how they relate to Rogers' false theta function. Then we obtain their full asymptotics, as \tau \rightarrow 0, and use this result to derive asymptotic properties of the coefficients in the q-expansion. At the end, we also introduce and discuss higher rank generalization of Bloch-Okounkov's functions.
