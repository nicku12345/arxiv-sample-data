In this note we show that any supersingular abelian variety is isogenous to a superspecial abelian variety without increasing field extensions. The proof uses minimal isogenies and the Galois descent. We then construct a superspecial abelian variety which not directly defined over a finite field. This answers negatively to a question of the author [J. Pure Appl. Alg., 2013] concerning of endomorphism algebras occurring in Shimura curves. Endomorphism algebras of supersingular elliptic curves over an arbitrary field are also investigated. We correct a main result of the author's paper [Math. Res. Let., 2010].
