We give a simple proof for the reciprocity formulas of character Dedekind sums associated with two primitive characters, whose modulus need not to be same, by utilizing the character analogue of the Euler-MacLaurin summation formula. Moreover, we extend known results on the integral of products of Bernoulli polynomials by considering the integral \[ \int\limits_{0}^{x}B_{n_{1}}(b_{1}z+y_{1})... B_{n_{r}}(b_{r}z+y_{r}) dz, \] where b_{l} (b_{l}\neq 0) and y_{l} (1\leq l\leq r) are real numbers. As a consequence of this integral we establish a connection between the reciprocity relations of sums of products of Bernoulli polynomials and of the Dedekind sums.
