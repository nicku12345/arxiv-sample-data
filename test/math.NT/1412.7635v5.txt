Given a field k of characteristic zero and an indeterminate T, the main topic of the paper is the construction of specializations of any given finite extension of k(T) of degree n that are degree n field extensions of k with specified local behavior at any given finite set of primes of k. First, we give a full non-Galois analog of a result with a ramified type conclusion from a preceding paper and next we prove a unifying statement which combines our results and previous work devoted to the unramified part of the problem in the case k is a number field.
