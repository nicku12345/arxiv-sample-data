Let G={\rm GL}_{2n} over a totally real number field F and n\geq 2. Let \Pi be a cuspidal automorphic representation of G(\mathbb A), which is cohomological and a functorial lift from SO(2n+1). The latter condition can be equivalently reformulated that the exterior square L-function of \Pi has a pole at s=1. In this paper, we prove a rationality result for the residue of the exterior square L-function at s=1 and also for the holomorphic value of the symmetric square L-function at s=1 attached to \Pi. On the way, we also show a rationality result for the residue of the Rankin--Selberg L-function at s=1, which is very much in the spirit of our recent joint paper with Harris and Lapid, as well as of one of the main results in a recent article of Balasubramanyam--Raghuram.
