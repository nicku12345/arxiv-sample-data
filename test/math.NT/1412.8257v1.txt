In this paper, considering the Eichler-Shimura cohomology theory for Jacobi forms, we study connections between harmonic Maass-Jacobi forms and Jacobi integrals. As an application we study a pairing between two Jacobi integrals, which is defined by special values of partial L-functions of skew-holomorphic Jacobi cusp forms. We obtain connections between this pairing and the Petersson inner product for skew-holomorphic Jacobi cusp forms. This result can be considered as analogue of Haberland formula of elliptic modular forms for Jacobi forms.
