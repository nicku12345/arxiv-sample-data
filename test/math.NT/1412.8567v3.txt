For m\ge 2, let \pi be an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_m(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}}) with unitary central character. Let a_\pi(n) be the n^{th} coefficient of the L-function attached to \pi. Goldfeld and Sengupta have recently obtained a bound for \sum_{n\le x} a_\pi(n) as x \rightarrow \infty. For m\ge 3 and \pi not a symmetric power of a GL_2(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}})-cuspidal automorphic representation with not all finite primes unramified for \pi, their bound is better than all previous bounds. In this paper, we further improve the bound of Golfeld and Sengupta. We also prove a quantitative result for the number of sign changes of the coefficients of certain automorphic L-functions, provided the coefficients are real numbers.
