We describe the semi-simplification of the mod p reduction of certain crystalline two dimensional local Galois representations of slopes in the interval (1,2) and all weights. The proof uses the mod p Local Langlands Correspondence for GL_2(Q_p). We also give a complete description of the submodules generated by the second highest monomial in the mod p symmetric power representations of GL_2(F_p).
