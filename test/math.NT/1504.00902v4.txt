Let A be an abelian variety over \mathbb{Q} of dimension g such that the image of its associated absolute Galois representation \rho_A is open in \operatorname{GSp}_{2g}(\hat{\mathbb{Z}}). We investigate the arithmetic of the traces a_{1, p} of the Frobenius at p in \operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) under \rho_A, modulo varying primes p. In particular, we obtain upper bounds for the counting function \#\{p \leq x: a_{1, p} = t\} and we prove an Erd\"os-Kac type theorem for the number of prime factors of a_{1, p}. We also formulate a conjecture about the asymptotic behaviour of \#\{p \leq x: a_{1, p} = t\}, which generalizes a well-known conjecture of S. Lang and H. Trotter from 1976 about elliptic curves.
