We prove some new cases of weight part of Serre's conjectures for mod p Galois representations associated to automorphic representations on unitary groups U(d). The approach is a generalization of the work of Gee-Liu-Savitt, namely, we study reductions of certain crystalline representations, as well as crystalline lifts of these reductions.
