We present a new proof of Corvaja and Zannier's \cite{C-Z} the upper bound of the number of solutions (x,y) of the algebraic equation P(x,y)=0 over a field \mathbb{F}_p (p is a prime), in the case, where x\in g_1G, y\in g_2G, (g_1G, g_2G -- are cosets by some subgroup G of a multiplicative group \mathbb{F}_p^*). The estimate of Corvaja and Zannier was improved in average, and some applications of it has been obtained. In particular we present the new bounds of additive and polynomial energy.
