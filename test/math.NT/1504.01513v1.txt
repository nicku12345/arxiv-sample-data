N. Katz has shown that any irreducible representation of the Galois group of F_q((t)) has unique extension to a special representation of the Galois group of k(t) unramified outside 0 and infinity and tamely ramified at infinity. In this paper we analyze the number of not necessarily special such extensions and relate this question to a description of bases in irreducible representations of multiplicative groups of division algebras.
