Given a finitely generated multiplicative subgroup of rational numbers \Gamma, assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we determine an asymptotic formula for average over prime numbers, powers of the order of the reduction group modulo p. The problem was considered in the case of rank 1 by Pomerance and Kurlberg. In the case when \Gamma contains only positive numbers, we give an explicit expression for the involved density in terms of an Euler product. We conclude with some numerical computations.
