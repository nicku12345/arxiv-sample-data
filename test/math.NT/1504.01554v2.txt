Let \Gamma\subset\mathbb{Q}^* be a finitely generated subgroup and let p be a prime such that the reduction group \Gamma_p is a well defined subgroup of the multiplicative group \mathbb{F}_p^*. We prove an asymptotic formula for the average of the number of primes p\le x for which the index [\mathbb{F}_p^*:\Gamma_p]=m. The average is performed over all finitely generated subgroups \Gamma=\langle a_1,\dots,a_r \rangle\subset\mathbb{Q}^*, with a_i\in\mathbb{Z} and a_i\le T_i with a range of uniformity: T_i>\exp(4(\log x \log\log x)^{\frac{1}{2}}) for every i=1,\dots,r. We also prove an asymptotic formula for the mean square of the error terms in the asymptotic formula with a similar range of uniformity. The case of rank 1 and m=1 corresponds to the classical Artin conjecture for primitive roots and has already been considered by Stephens in 1969.
