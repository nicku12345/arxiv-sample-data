Let a,b,c be positive integers. It is known that there are infinitely many positive integers not representated by ax^2+by^2+cz^2 with x,y,z\in\mathbb Z. In contrast, we conjecture that any natural number is represented by \lfloor x^2/a\rfloor+\lfloor y^2/b\rfloor +\lfloor z^2/c\rfloor with x,y,z\in\mathbb Z if (a,b,c)\not=(1,1,1),(2,2,2), and that any natural number is represented by \lfloor T_x/a\rfloor+\lfloor T_y/b\rfloor+\lfloor T_z/c\rfloor with x,y,z\in\mathbb Z, where T_x denotes the triangular number x(x+1)/2. We confirm this general conjecture in some special cases; in particular, we prove that \left\{x^2+y^2+\left\lfloor\frac{z^2}5\right\rfloor:\ x,y,z\in\mathbb Z\ \mbox{and}\ 2\nmid y\right\}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\} and \left\{\left\lfloor\frac{x^2}m\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{y^2}m\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{z^2}m\right\rfloor:\ x,y,z\in\mathbb Z\right\} =\{0,1,2,\ldots\}\ \ \mbox{for}\ m=5,6,15. We also pose several conjectures for further research; for example, we conjecture that any integer can be written as x^4-y^3+z^2, where x, y and z are positive integers.
