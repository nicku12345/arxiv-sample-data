For L(\cdot,\pi) in a large class of L-functions, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we show an explicit bound for the function S_1(t,\pi)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{1/2}^\infty\log|L(\sigma+it,\pi)|\,d\sigma, expressed in terms of its analytic conductor. This enables us to give an alternative proof of the most recent (conditional) bound for S(t,\pi)=\frac{1}{\pi} \,arg\,L(\tfrac12+it,\pi), which is the derivative of S_1(\cdot,\pi) at t.
