We study the 2-parity conjecture for Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves over number fields. Under some mild assumptions on their reduction, we prove it over quadratic extensions of the base field, providing essentially the first examples of the 2-parity conjecture in dimension greater than one. The proof proceeds via a generalisation of a formula of Kramer and Tunnell relating local invariants of the curve, which may be of independent interest. Particularly surprising is the appearance in the formula of terms that govern whether or not the Cassels-Tate pairing on the Jacobian is alternating, which first appeared in a paper of Poonen and Stoll. We prove this local formula in many instances and show that in all cases it follows from standard global conjectures.
