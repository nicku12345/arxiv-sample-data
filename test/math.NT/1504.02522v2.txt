Let A be an abelian variety defined over anumber field F. In this paper, we will investigate the growth of p-rank of the fine Selmer group in three situations. In particular, in each of these situations, we show that there is a strong analogy between the growth of the p-rank of the fine Selmer group and the growth of the p-rank of the class groups.
