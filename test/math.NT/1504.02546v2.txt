For an elliptic curve E over a local field K and a separable quadratic extension of K, motivated by connections to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, Kramer and Tunnell have conjectured a formula for computing the local root number of the base change of E to the quadratic extension in terms of a certain norm index. The formula is known in all cases except some when K is of characteristic 2, and we complete its proof by reducing the positive characteristic case to characteristic 0. For this reduction, we exploit the principle that local fields of characteristic p can be approximated by finite extensions of \mathbb{Q}_p--we find an elliptic curve E' defined over a p-adic field such that all the terms in the Kramer-Tunnell formula for E' are equal to those for E.
