Primitive prime divisors play an important role in group theory and number theory. We study a certain number theoretic quantity, called \Phi^*_n(q), which is closely related to the cyclotomic polynomial \Phi_n(x) and to primitive prime divisors of q^n-1. Our definition of \Phi^*_n(q) is novel, and we prove it is equivalent to the definition given by Hering. Given positive constants c and k, we give an algorithm for determining all pairs (n,q) with \Phi^*_n(q)\le cn^k. This algorithm is used to extend (and correct) a result of Hering which is useful for classifying certain families of subgroups of finite linear groups.
