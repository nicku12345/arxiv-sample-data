We say a natural number~n is abundant if \sigma(n)>2n, where \sigma(n) denotes the sum of the divisors of~n. The aliquot parts of~n are those divisors less than~n, and we say that an abundant number~n is pseudoperfect if there is some subset of the aliquot parts of~n which sum to~n. We say~n is weird if~n is abundant but not pseudoperfect. We call a weird number~n primitive if none of its aliquot parts are weird. We find all primitive weird numbers of the form 2^kpq (p<q being odd primes) for 1\le k\le14. We also find primitive weird numbers of the same form, larger than any previously published.
