Fix a number field k and a rational prime \ell. We consider abelian varieties whose \ell-power torsion generates a pro-\ell extension of k(\mu_{\ell^\infty}) which is unramified away from \ell. It is a necessary, but not generally sufficient, condition that such varieties have good reduction away from \ell. In the special case of \ell = 2, we demonstrate that for abelian surfaces A/\mathbb{Q}, good reduction away from \ell does suffice. The result is extended to elliptic curves and abelian surfaces over certain number fields unramified away from \{2,\infty\}. An explicit example is constructed to demonstrate that good reduction is not sufficient, at \ell = 2, for abelian varieties of sufficiently high dimension.
