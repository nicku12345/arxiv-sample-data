We give nontrivial bounds for the bilinear sums  \sum_{u = 1}^{U} \sum_{v=1}^V \alpha_u \beta_v \mathbf{\,e}_p(u/f(v))  where \mathbf{\,e}_p(z) is a nontrivial additive character of the prime finite field {\mathbb F}_p of p elements, with integers U, V, a polynomial f\in {\mathbb F}_p[X]  and some complex weights \{\alpha_u\}, \{\beta_v\}. In particular, for f(X)=aX+b we obtain new bounds of bilinear sums with Kloosterman fractions. We also obtain new bounds for similar sums with multiplicative characters of {\mathbb F}_p.
