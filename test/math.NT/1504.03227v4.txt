Let {\mathcal{P}_{n}} denote the set of positive integers which are prime to n. Let B_{n} be the n-th Bernoulli number. For any prime p \ge 11 and integer r\ge 2, we prove that  \sum\limits_{\begin{smallmatrix}   {{l}_{1}}+{{l}_{2}}+\cdots +{{l}_{6}}={{p}^{r}}   {{l}_{1}},\cdots ,{{l}_{6}}\in {\mathcal{P}_{p}} \end{smallmatrix}}{\frac{1}{{{l}_{1}}{{l}_{2}}{{l}_{3}}{{l}_{4}}{{l}_{5}}{l}_{6}}}\equiv - \frac{{5!}}{18}p^{r-1}B_{p-3}^{2} \pmod{{{p}^{r}}}.  This extends a family of curious congruences. We also obtain other interesting congruences involving multiple harmonic sums and Bernoulli numbers.
