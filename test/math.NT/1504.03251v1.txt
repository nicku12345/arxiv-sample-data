Let C be a convex d-dimensional body. If \rho is a large positive number, then the dilated body \rho C contains \rho^{d}\left\vert C\right\vert +\mathcal{O}\left( \rho^{d-1}\right)  integer points, where \left\vert C\right\vert  denotes the volume of C. The above error estimate \mathcal{O}\left( \rho^{d-1}\right)  can be improved in several cases. We are interested in the L^{2}-discrepancy D_{C}(\rho) of a copy of \rho C thrown at random in \mathbb{R}^{d}. More precisely, we consider \[ D_{C}(\rho):=\left\{ \int_{\mathbb{T}^{d}}\int_{SO(d)}\left\vert \textrm{card}\left( \left( \rho\sigma(C)+t\right) \cap\mathbb{Z}^d\right) - \rho^{d}\left\vert C\right\vert \right\vert ^{2}d\sigma dt\right\} ^{1/2}\ , \] where \mathbb{T}^{d}= \mathbb{R}^{d}/\mathbb{Z}^{d} is the d-dimensional flat torus and SO\left( d\right)  is the special orthogonal group of real orthogonal matrices of determinant 1.   An argument of D. Kendall shows that D_{C}(\rho)\leq c\ \rho^{(d-1)/2}. If C also satisfies the reverse inequality \ D_{C}(\rho)\geq c_{1} \ \rho^{(d-1)/2}, we say that C is L^{2}\emph{-regular}. L. Parnovski and A. Sobolev proved that, if d>1, a d-dimensional unit ball is L^{2}% -regular if and only if d\not \equiv 1\ (\operatorname{mod}4).   In this paper we characterize the L^{2}-regular convex polygons. More precisely we prove that a convex polygon is not L^{2}-regular if and only if it can be inscribed in a circle and it is symmetric about the centre.
