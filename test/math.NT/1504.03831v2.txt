We explicitly write down the Eisenstein elements inside the space of modular symbols for Eisenstein series with integer coefficients for the congruence subgroups {\Gamma}_0 (pq) with p and q distinct odd primes, giving an answer to a question of Merel in these cases. We also compute the winding elements explicitly for these congruence subgroups. Our results are explicit versions of the Manin-Drinfeld Theorem.
