For a half-integral weight modular form f = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_f(n)n^{\frac{k-1}{2}} q^n of weight k = l +\frac{1}{2} on \Gamma_0(4) such that a_f(n) (n \in \mathbb{N}) are real, we prove for a fixed suitable natural number r that a_f(n) changes sign infinitely often as n varies over numbers having at most r prime factors, assuming the analog of the Ramanujan conjecture for half-integral weight forms.
