We prove a formula for the coefficients of a weight 3/2 Cohen-Eisenstein series of square-free level N. This formula generalizes a result of Gross and in particular, it proves a conjecture of Quattrini. Let l be an odd prime number. For any elliptic curve E defined over \mathbb{Q} of rank zero and square-free conductor N, if l \mid |E(\mathbb{Q})|, under certain conditions on the Shafarevich-Tate group III_D, we show that l divides |III_D| if and only if l divides the class number h(-D) of \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D}).
