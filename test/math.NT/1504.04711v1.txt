Hardy and Littlewood conjectured that every sufficiently large integer is either a square or the sum of a prime and a square. Let E(x) be the number of positive integers up to x\ge4 which does not satisfy this condition. We prove E(x)\ll x^{1/2}(\log x)^A(\log\log x)^4with A=3/2 under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. This is a small improvement of the previous remarks of Mikawa (1993) and Perelli-Zaccagnini (1995) which claims A=4,3 respectively.
