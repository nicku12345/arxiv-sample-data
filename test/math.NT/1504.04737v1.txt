This paper draws connections between the double shuffle equations and structure of associators; universal mixed elliptic motives as defined by Hain and Matsumoto; and the Rankin-Selberg method for modular forms for SL_2(\mathbb{Z}). We write down explicit formulae for zeta elements \sigma_{2n-1} (generators of the Tannaka Lie algebra of the category of mixed Tate motives over \mathbb{Z}) in depths up to four, give applications to the Broadhurst-Kreimer conjecture, and completely solve the double shuffle equations for multiple zeta values in depths two and three.
