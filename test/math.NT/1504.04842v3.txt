Let p be a prime greater than 3. Consider the modular curve X_0(3p) over \mathbb{Q} and its Jacobian variety J_0(3p) over \mathbb{Q}. Let \mathcal{T}(3p) and \mathcal{C}(3p) be the group of rational torsion points on J_0(3p) and the cuspidal group of J_0(3p), respectively. We prove that the 3-primary subgroups of \mathcal{T}(3p) and \mathcal{C}(3p) coincide unless p\equiv 1 \pmod 9 and 3^{\frac{p-1}{3}} \equiv 1 \!\pmod {p}.
