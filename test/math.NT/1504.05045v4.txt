Inspired by prior work of Bruinier and Ono and Mertens and Rolen, we study class polynomials for non-holomorphic modular functions arising from modular forms of negative weight. In particular, we give general conditions for the irreducibility of class polynomials. This allows us to easily generate infintely many new class invariants.
