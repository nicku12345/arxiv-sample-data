Referring to Ramanujan's original definition of a mock theta function, Rhoades asked for explicit formulas for radial limits of the universal mock theta functions g_2 and g_3. Recently, Bringmann and Rolen found such formulas for specializations of g_2. Here we treat the case of g_3, generalizing radial limit results for the rank generating function of Folsom, Ono, and Rhoades. Furthermore, we find expressions for radial limits of fifth order mock theta functions different from those of Bajpai, Kimport, Liang, Ma, and Ricci.
