We prove a bound for quintilinear sums of Kloosterman sums, with congruence conditions on the "smooth" summation variables. This generalizes classical work of Deshouillers and Iwaniec, and is key to obtaining power-saving error terms in applications, notably the dispersion method. As a consequence, assuming the Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions, we prove a power-saving error term in the Titchmarsh divisor problem of estimating \sum_{p\leq x}\tau(p-1). Unconditionally, we isolate the possible contribution of Siegel zeroes, showing it is always negative. Extending work of Fouvry and Tenenbaum, we obtain power-saving in the asymptotic formula for \sum_{n\leq x}\tau_k(n)\tau(n+1), reproving a result announced by Bykovski\u{i} and Vinogradov by a different method. The gain in the exponent is shown to be independent of k if a generalized Lindel\"of hypothesis is assumed.
