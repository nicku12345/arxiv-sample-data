Given a sequence of distinct positive integers v_1,v_2,\ldots and any positive integer n, the discriminator D_v(n) is defined as the smallest positive integer m such v_1,\ldots,v_n are pairwise incongruent modulo m. We consider the discriminator for the sequence u_1,u_2,\ldots, where u_j equals the absolute value of ((-3)^j-5)/4, that is u_j=(3^j-5(-1)^j)/4. We prove a 2012 conjecture of Sabin Salajan characterizing the discriminator of the sequence u_1,u_2,\ldots.
