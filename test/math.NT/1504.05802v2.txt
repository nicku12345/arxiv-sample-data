The L-function of symmetric powers of classical Kloosterman sums is a polynomial whose degree is now known, as well as the complex absolute values of the roots. In this paper, we provide estimates for the p-adic absolute values of these roots. Our method is indirect. We first develop a Dwork-type p-adic cohomology theory for the two-variable infinite symmetric power L-function associated to the Kloosterman family, and then study p-adic estimates of the eigenvalues of Frobenius. A continuity argument then provides the desired p-adic estimates.
