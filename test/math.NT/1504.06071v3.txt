In 1938, Skolem conjectured that \mathbf{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}) is not a polynomial family for any n \ge 2. Carter and Keller disproved Skolem's conjecture for all n \ge 3 by proving that \mathbf{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}) is boundedly generated by the elementary matrices, and hence a polynomial family for any n \ge 3. Only recently, Vaserstein refuted Skolem's conjecture completely by showing that \mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) is a polynomial family. An immediate consequence of Vaserstein's theorem also implies that \mathbf{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}) is a polynomial family for any n \ge 3. In this paper, we prove a function field analogue of Vaserstein's theorem: that is, if \mathbf{A} is the ring of polynomials over a finite field of odd characteristic, then \mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbf{A}) is a polynomial family in 52 variables. A consequence of our main result also implies that \mathbf{SL}_n(\mathbf{A}) is a polynomial family for any n \ge 3.
