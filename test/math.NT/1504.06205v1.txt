Let F be a finite field of odd cardinality q, A=F[T] the polynomial ring over F, k=F(T) the rational function field over F and \mathcal{H} the set of square-free monic polynomials in A of degree odd. If D\in\mathcal{H}, we denote by \mathcal{O}_{D} the integral closure of A in k(\sqrt{D}). In this note we give a simple proof for the average value of the size of the groups K_{2}(\mathcal{O}_{D}) as D varies over the ensemble \mathcal{H} and q is kept fixed. The proof is based on character sums estimates and in the use of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.
