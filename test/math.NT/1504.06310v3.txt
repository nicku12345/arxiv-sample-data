Building on the construction of big Heegner points in the quaternionic setting, and their relation to special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, we obtain anticyclotomic analogues of the results of Emerton-Pollack-Weston on the variation of Iwasawa invariants in Hida families. In particular, combined with the known cases of the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture in weight 2, our results yield a proof of the main conjecture for p-ordinary newforms of higher weights and trivial nebentypus.
