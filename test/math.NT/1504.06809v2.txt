This paper deals with function field analogues of the famous theorem of Landau which gives the asymptotic density of sums of two squares in \mathbb{Z}.   We define the analogue of a sum of two squares in \mathbb{F}_q[T] and estimate the number B_q(n) of such polynomials of degree n in two cases. The first case is when q is large and n fixed and the second case is when n is large and q is fixed. Although the methods used and main terms computed in each of the two cases differ, the two iterated limits of (a normalization of) B_q(n) turn out to be exactly the same.
