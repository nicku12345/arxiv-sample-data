Let B be a half-integral symmetric matrix of size n defined over \mathbb{Q}_p. The Gross-Keating invariant of B was defined by Gross and Keating, and has important applications to arithmetic geometry. But the nature of the Gross-Keating invariant was not understood very well for n\geq 4. In this paper, we establish basic properties of the Gross-Keating invariant of a half-integral symmetric matrix of general size over an arbitrary non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero.
