In this paper, we generalize D. H. Lehmer's result to give a sufficient condition for level one cusp forms f with integral Fourier coefficients such that the smallest n for which the coefficients a_n(f)=0 must be a prime. Then we describe a method to compute a bound B of n such that a_n(f)\ne0 for all n<B. As examples, we achieve the explicit bounds B_k for the unique cusp form \Delta_{k} of level one and weight k with k=16, 18, 20, 22, 26 such that a_n(\Delta_k)\ne0 for all n<B_k.
