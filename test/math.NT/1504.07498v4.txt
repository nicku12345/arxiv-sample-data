Shimura curves are moduli spaces of abelian surfaces with quaternion multiplication. Models of Shimura curves are very important in number theory. Klein's icosahedral invariants \mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B} and \mathfrak{C} give the Hilbert modular forms for \sqrt{5} via the period mapping for a family of K3 surfaces. Using the period mappings for several families of K3 surfaces, we obtain explicit models of Shimura curves with small discriminant in the weighted projective space {\rm Proj} (\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B},\mathfrak{C}]).
