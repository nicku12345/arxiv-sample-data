In the theory of complex multiplication, it is important to construct class fields over CM fields. In this paper, we consider explicit K3 surfaces parametrized by Klein's icosahedral invariants. Via the periods and the Shioda-Inose structures of K3 surfaces, the special values of icosahedral invariants generate class fields over quartic CM fields. Moreover, we give an explicit expression of the canonical model of the Shimura variety for the simplest case via the periods of K3 surfaces.
