Let C be a cubic form with rational coefficients in n variables, and let h be the h-invariant of C. Let L_1, \ldots, L_r be linear forms with real coefficients such that if \boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \mathbb{R}^r \setminus \{ \boldsymbol{0} \} then \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \mathbf{L} is not a rational form. Assume that h > 16 + 8 r. Let \boldsymbol{\tau} \in \mathbb{R}^r, and let \eta be a positive real number. We prove an asymptotic formula for the weighted number of integer solutions \mathbf{x} \in [-P,P]^n to the system C(\mathbf{x}) = 0, \: |\mathbf{L}(\mathbf{x}) - \boldsymbol{\tau}| < \eta. If the coefficients of the linear forms are algebraically independent over the rationals, then we may replace the h-invariant condition with the hypothesis n > 16 + 9 r, and show that the system has an integer solution. Finally, we show that the values of \mathbf{L} at integer zeros of C are equidistributed modulo one in \mathbb{R}^r, requiring only that h > 16.
