For a reciprocity functor \mathcal{M} we consider the local symbol complex \mathcal{M}\otimes^{M}\mathbb{G}_{m}(\eta_{C})\to\oplus_{P\in C}\mathcal{M}(k)\to\mathcal{M}(k), where C is a smooth complete curve over an algebraically closed field k with generic point \eta_{C} and \otimes^{M} is the product of Mackey functors. We prove that if \mathcal{M} satisfies certain conditions, then the homology of the above complex is isomorphic to the K-group of reciprocity functors T(\mathcal{M},\underline{CH}_{0}(C)^{0})(Spec k).
