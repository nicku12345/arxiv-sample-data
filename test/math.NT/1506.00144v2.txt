In this notes we make a comparison between the arithmetic properties of irrational numbers and their dynamical properties under the Gauss map. We show some equivalences between different classifications of irrational numbers such as the Diophantine classes and numbers admitting approximations by rational numbers at a given 'speed'. We also show that irrational numbers with finite upper Lyapunov exponent for the Gauss map satisfy a Diophantine condition.
