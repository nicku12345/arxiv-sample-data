Various problems on integers lead to the class of congruence preserving functions on rings, i.e. functions verifying a-b divides f(a)-f(b) for all a,b. We characterized these classes of functions in terms of sums of rational polynomials (taking only integral values) and the function giving the least common multiple of 1,2,\ldots,k. The tool used to obtain these characterizations is "lifting": if \pi\colon X\to Y is a surjective morphism, and f a function on Y a lifting of f is a function F on X such that \pi\circ F=f\circ\pi. In this paper we relate the finite and infinite notions by proving that the finite case can be lifted to the infinite one. For p-adic and profinite integers we get similar characterizations via lifting. We also prove that lattices of recognizable subsets of Z are stable under inverse image by congruence preserving functions.
