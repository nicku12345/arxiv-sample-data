Ohno's relation is a well-known relation among multiple zeta values.In this paper, we prove Ohno-type relation for finite multiple zeta values, which is conjectured by Kaneko.As a corollary, we give an alternative proof of the sum formula for finite multiple zeta values, which was first proved by Saito and Wakabayashi.
