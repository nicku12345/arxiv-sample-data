It is well-known that the Fourier coefficients of Siegel-Eisenstein series can be expressed in terms of the Siegel series. The functional equation of the Siegel series of a quadratic form over \mathbb{Q}_p was first proved by Katsurada. In this paper, we prove the functional equation of the Siegel series over a non-archimedean local field by using the representation theoretic argument by Kudla and Sweet.
