Let K be a number field, \mathfrak{q} be an integral ideal, and \mathrm{Cl}(\mathfrak{q}) be the associated ray class group. Suppose \mathrm{Cl}(\mathfrak{q}) possesses a real exceptional character \psi, possibly principal, with a Siegel zero \beta. For \mathcal{C} \in \mathrm{Cl}(\mathfrak{q}) satisfying \psi(\mathcal{C}) = 1, we establish an effective K-uniform Linnik-type bound with explicit constants for the least norm of a prime ideal \mathfrak{p} \in \mathcal{C}.   A special case of this result is related to rational primes represented by certain binary quadratic forms.
