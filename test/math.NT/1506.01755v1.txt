In this paper, we apply the saddle-point method in conjunction with the theory of the N\ddot{o}rlund-Rice integrals to derive a precise asymptotic formula for the generalized Li coefficients established by Omar and Mazhouda. Actually, for any function F in the Selberg class \mathcal{S} and under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we have \lambda_{F}(n)=\frac{d_{F}}{2}n\log n+c_{F}n+O(\sqrt{n}\log n), with c_{F}=\frac{d_{F}}{2}(\gamma-1)+\frac{1}{2}\log(\lambda Q_{F}^{2}),\ \ \lambda=\prod_{j=1}^{r}\lambda_{j}^{2\lambda_{j}}, where \gamma is the Euler constant and the notation is as bellow.
