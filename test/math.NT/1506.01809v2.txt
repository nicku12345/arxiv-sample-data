In this paper, a transformation formula under modular substitutions is derived for a large class of generalized Eisenstein series. Appearing in the transformation formulae are generalizations of Dedekind sums involving the periodic Bernoulli function. Reciprocity theorems are proved for these Dedekind sums. Furthermore, as an application of the transformation formulae, relations between various infinite series and evaluations of several infinite series are deduced. Finally, we consider these sums for some special cases.
