In this paper we consider transformation formulas for \[ B\left( z,s:\chi\right) =\sum\limits_{m=1}^{\infty}\sum\limits_{n=0} ^{\infty}\chi(m)\chi(2n+1)\left( 2n+1\right) ^{s-1}e^{\pi im(2n+1)z/k}. \] We derive reciprocity theorems for the sums arising in these transformation formulas and investigate certain properties of them. With the help of the character analogues of the Euler--Maclaurin summation formula we establish integral representations for the Hardy-Berndt character sums s_{3,p}\left( d,c:\chi\right)  and s_{4,p}\left( d,c:\chi\right) .
