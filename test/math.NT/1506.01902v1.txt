We establish that, for almost all natural numbers N, there is a sum of two positive integral cubes lying in the interval [N-N^{7/18+\epsilon},N]. Here, the exponent 7/18 lies half way between the trivial exponent 4/9 stemming from the greedy algorithm, and the exponent 1/3 constrained by the number of integers not exceeding X that can be represented as the sum of two positive integral cubes. We also provide analogous conclusions for sums of two positive integral k-th powers when k\ge 4.
