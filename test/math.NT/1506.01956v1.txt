By Grothendieck's anabelian conjectures, Galois representations landing in outer automorphism group of the algebraic fundamental group which are associated to hyperbolic smooth curves defined over number-fields encode all the arithmetic information of these curves. The Goal of this paper is to develop an arithmetic Teichmuller theory, by which we mean, introducing arithmetic objects summarizing the arithmetic information coming from all curves of the same topological type defined over number-fields. We also introduce Hecke-Teichmuller Lie algebra which plays the role of Hecke algebra in the anabelian framework.
