In this paper we propose and prove an anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for Heegner points on supersingular elliptic curves with a_p=0. The result has a "\pm" nature in the sense of Kobayashi. The proof uses a recent work of the second author on one divisibility in the Iwasawa--Greenberg main conjecture for Rankin-Selberg p-adic L-functions, together with an argument of Howard (adapted to our "\pm"-situation). As a byproduct, we also obtain an improvement of Skinner's result on a converse to the Gross--Zagier--Kolyvagin theorem.
