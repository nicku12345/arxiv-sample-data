We prove an asymptotic formula for the shifted convolution of the divisor functions d_3(n) and d(n), which is uniform in the shift parameter and which has a power-saving error term. The method is also applied to give analogous estimates for the shifted convolution of d_3(n) and Fourier coefficents of holomorphic cusp forms. These asymptotics improve previous results obtained by several different authors.
