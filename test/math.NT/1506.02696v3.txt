In the paper "On the interpolation of integer-valued polynomials" (Journal of Number Theory 133 (2013), pp. 4224--4232.) V. Volkov and F. Petrov consider the problem of existence of the so-called n-universal sets (related to simultaneous p-orderings of Bhargava) in the ring of Gaussian integers. We extend their results to arbitrary imaginary quadratic number fields and prove an existence theorem that provides a strong counterexample to a conjecture of Volkov-Petrov on minimal cardinality of n-universal sets. Along the way, we discover a link with Euler-Kronecker constants and prove a lower bound on Euler-Kronecker constants which is of the same order of magnitude as the one obtained by Ihara.
