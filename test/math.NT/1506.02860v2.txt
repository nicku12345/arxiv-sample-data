Using a combination of several powerful modularity theorems and class field theory we derive a new modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves over certain real abelian fields. We deduce that if K is a real abelian field of conductor n<100, with 5 \nmid n and n \ne 29, 87, 89, then every semistable elliptic curve E over K is modular.   Let \ell, m, p be prime, with \ell, m \ge 5 and p \ge 3.To a putative non-trivial primitive solution of the generalized Fermat x^{2\ell}+y^{2m}=z^p we associate a Frey elliptic curve defined over \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)^+, and study its mod \ell representation with the help of level lowering and our modularity result. We deduce the non-existence of non-trivial primitive solutions if p \le 11, or if p=13 and \ell, m \ne 7.
