We study two kinds of conjectural bounds for the prime gap after the k-th prime p_k: (A) p_{k+1} < (p_k)^{1+1/k} and (B) p_{k+1}-p_k < \log^2 p_k - \log p_k - b for k>9. The upper bound (A) is equivalent to Firoozbakht's conjecture. We prove that (A) implies (B) with b=1; on the other hand, (B) with b=1.17 implies (A). We also give other sufficient conditions for (A) that have the form (B) with b\to1 as k\to\infty.
