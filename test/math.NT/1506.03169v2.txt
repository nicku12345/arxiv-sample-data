Let f(n) denote the number of 1-shell totally symmetric plane partitions of weight n. Recently, Hirschhorn and Sellers, Yao, and Xia established a number of congruences modulo 2 and 5, 4 and 8, and 25 for f(n), respectively. In this note, we shall prove several new congruences modulo 125 and 11 by using some results of modular forms. For example, for all n\ge 0, we have \begin{align*} f(1250n+125)&\equiv 0 \pmod{125},\\ f(1250n+1125)&\equiv 0 \pmod{125},\\ f(2750n+825)&\equiv 0 \pmod{11},\\ f(2750n+1925)&\equiv 0 \pmod{11}. \end{align*}
