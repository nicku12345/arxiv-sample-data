The class of (0,m,s)-nets in base b has been introduced by Niederreiter as examples of point sets in the s-dimensional unit cube with excellent uniform distribution properties. In particular such nets have been proved to have very low discrepancy. This property is essential for the use of nets in quasi-Monte Carlo rules for numerical integration. In this short note we propose two algorithms for the construction of plane (0,m,2)-nets in base~b.
