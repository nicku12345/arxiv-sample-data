Given a recurrent sequence {\bf U}:=\{U_n\}_{n\ge 0} we consider the problem of counting {\mathcal M}_U(x), the number of integers n\le x such that U_n=u^2+nv^2 for some integers u,v. We will show that {\mathcal M}_U(x)\ll x(\log x)^{-0.05} for a large class of ternary sequences. Our method uses many ingredients from the proof of Alba Gonz\'alez and the second author that {\mathcal M}_F(x)\ll x(\log x)^{-0.06}, with \bf F the Fibonacci sequence.
