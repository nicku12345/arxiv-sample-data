We study the average error term in the usual approximation to the number of y-friable integers congruent to a modulo q, where a\neq 0 is a fixed integer. We show that in the range \exp\{(\log\log x)^{5/3+\varepsilon}\} \leq y \leq x and on average over q\leq x/M with M\rightarrow \infty of moderate size, this average error term is asymptotic to -|a|\Psi(x/|a|,y)/2x. Previous results of this sort were obtained by the second author for reasonably dense sequences, however the sequence of y-friable integers studied in the current paper is thin, and required the use of different techniques, which are specific to friable integers.
