Based on ideas from recent joint work with Bjorn Poonen, we describe an algorithm that can in certain cases determine the set of rational points on a curve C, given only the p-Selmer group S of its Jacobian (or some other abelian variety C maps to) and the image of the p-Selmer set of C in S. The method is more likely to succeed when the genus is large, which is when it is usually rather difficult to obtain generators of a finite-index subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group, which one would need to apply Chabauty's method in the usual way. We give some applications, for example to generalized Fermat equations of the form x^5 + y^5 = z^p.
