A theorem of Swan states that the locally free class group of a maximal order in a central simple algebra is isomorphic to a restricted ideal class group of the center. In this article we discuss this theorem and its generalization to separable algebras for which it is more applicable to integral representations of finite groups. This is an expository article with aim to introduce the topic for non-specialists.
