Let K be a number field, A/K be an absolutely simple abelian variety of CM type, and \ell be a prime number. We give explicit bounds on the degree over K of the division fields K(A[\ell^n]), and when A is an elliptic curve we also describe the full Galois group of K(A_{\text{tors}})/K. This makes explicit previous results of Serre and Ribet, and strengthens a theorem of Banaszak, Gajda and Kraso\'n. Our bounds are especially sharp in case the CM type of A is nondegenerate.
