We lower bound the Faltings height of an abelian variety over a number field by the sum of its injectivity diameter and the norm of its bad reduction primes. It leads to an unconditional bound on the rank of Mordell-Weil groups. Assuming the height conjecture of Lang and Silverman, we then obtain a Northcott property for the regulator on the set of simple abelian varieties defined over a fixed number field, of fixed dimension g, bounded rank and with dense rational points over a number field. We remove the simplicity assumption in the principally polarized case by giving a refined version of the Lang-Silverman conjecture.
