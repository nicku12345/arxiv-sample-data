We study the relationship between recent conjectures on slopes of overconvergent p-adic modular forms "near the boundary" of p-adic weight space. We also prove in tame level 1 that the coefficients of the Fredholm series of the U_p operator never vanish modulo p, a phenomenon that fails at higher level. In higher level, we do check that infinitely many coefficients are non-zero modulo p using a modular interpretation of the mod p reduction of the Fredholm series recently discovered by Andreatta, Iovita and Pilloni.
