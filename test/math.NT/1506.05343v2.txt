Let \psi and F be positive definite forms with integral coefficients of equal degree. Using the circle method, we establish an asymptotic formula for the number of identical representations of \psi by F, provided \psi is everywhere locally representable and the number of variables of F is large enough. In the quadratic case this supersedes a recent result due to Dietmann and Harvey. Another application addresses the number of primitive linear spaces contained in a hypersurface.
