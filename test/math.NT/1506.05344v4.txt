We construct new smallest parts partition functions and smallest parts crank functions by considering variations of Bailey's Lemma and conjugate Bailey pairs. The functions we introduce satisfy simple linear congruences modulo 3 and 5. We introduce and give identities for two four variable q-hypergeometric functions; these functions specialize to some of our new spt-crank-type functions as well as many known spt-crank-type functions.
