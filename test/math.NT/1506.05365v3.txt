Neukirch has developed explicit and axiomatic class field theory, which applies to both local and global fields. One of the key ingredients in his theory is a \hat{\mathbb{Z}}-extension of the base field, and in the case of \mathbb{Q}_p, he uses the maximal unramified extension. However \mathbb{Q}_p has another \hat{\mathbb{Z}}-extension, which we shall denote by \hat{\mathbb{Q}}_p. Thus, it is natural to ask if we could verify all the axioms required by taking \hat{\mathbb{Q}}_p as the central object instead. We prove this is possible and the two reciprocity maps induced from the two distinct \hat{\mathbb{Z}}-extensions are the same.
