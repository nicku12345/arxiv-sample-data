We begin by introducing an extension of the traditional abundancy index to imaginary quadratic rings with unique factorization. After showing that many of the properties of the traditional abundancy index continue to hold in our extended form, we investigate what we call n-powerfully solitary numbers in these rings. This definition serves to extend the concept of solitary numbers, which have been defined and studied in the integers. We end with some open questions and a conjecture.
