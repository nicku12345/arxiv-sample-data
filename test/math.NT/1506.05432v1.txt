The range of the divisor function \sigma_{-1} is dense in the interval [1,\infty). However, the range of the function \sigma_{-2} is not dense in the interval \displaystyle{\left[1,\frac{\pi^2}{6}\right)}. We begin by generalizing the divisor functions to a class of functions \sigma_{t} for all real t. We then define a constant \eta\approx 1.8877909 and show that if r\in(1,\infty), then the range of the function \sigma_{-r} is dense in the interval [1,\zeta(r)) if and only if r\leq\eta. We end with an open problem.
