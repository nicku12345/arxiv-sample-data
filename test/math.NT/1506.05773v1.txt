The Rankin-Selberg method for studying Langlands' automorphic L-functions is to find integral representations, involving certain Fourier coefficients of cusp forms and Eisenstein series, for these functions. In this thesis we develop the local theory for generic representations of special orthogonal groups. We study the local integrals for SO_{2l}\times GL_{n}, where SO_{2l} is the special even orthogonal group, either split or quasi-split, over a local non-Archimedean field. These integrals admit a functional equation, which is used to define a \gamma-factor. We show that, as expected, the \gamma-factor is identical with Shahidi's \gamma-factor. The analytic properties of the integrals are condensed into a notion of a greatest common divisor (g.c.d.). We establish certain bounds on the g.c.d. and relate it to the L-function defined by Shahidi in several cases, thereby providing another point of view on the L-function, linking it to the poles of the integrals. In particular, in the tempered case under a reasonable assumption the g.c.d. is equal to the L-function. Finally, this study includes the computation of the integrals with unramified data. This work may lead to new applications of the descent method, as well as aid in analyzing the poles of the global L-function.
