Let K be a field with G_K(2) \simeq G_{\mathbb{Q}_2}(2), where G_F(2) denotes the maximal pro-2 quotient of the absolute Galois group of a field F. We prove that then K admits a (non-trivial) valuation v which is 2-henselian and has residue field \mathbb{F}_2. Furthermore, v(2) is a minimal positive element in the value group \Gamma_v and [\Gamma_v:2\Gamma_v]=2. This forms the first positive result on a more general conjecture about the structure of pro-p Galois groups which we formulate precisely (cf. Conjecture 1). As an application, we prove a strong version of the birational section conjecture for smooth, complete curves X over \mathbb{Q}_2, as well as an analogue for varieties.
