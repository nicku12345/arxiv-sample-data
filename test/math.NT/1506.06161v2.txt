This paper studies algebraic and analytic structures associated with the Lerch zeta function, extending the complex variables viewpoint taken in part II. The Lerch transcendent \Phi(s, z, c) is obtained from the Lerch zeta function \zeta(s, a, c) by the change of variable z=e^{2 \pi i a}. We show that it analytically continues to a maximal domain of holomorphy in three complex variables (s, z, c) as a multivalued function defined over the base manifold {\bf C} \times P^1({\bf C} \smallsetminus \{0, 1, \infty\}) \times ({\bf C}\smallsetminus {\bf Z}). and compute the monodromy functions defining the multivaluedness. For positive integer values s=m and c=1 this function is closely related to the classical m-th order polylogarithm Li_m(z) We study its behavior as a function of two variables (z, c) for special values where s=m is an integer. For m \ge 1 it gives a one-parameter deformation of the polylogarithm, and satisfies a linear ODE with coefficients depending on c, of order m+1 of Fuchsian type. We determine its (m+1)-dimensional monodromy representation, which is a non-algebraic deformation of the monodromy of Li_m(z).
