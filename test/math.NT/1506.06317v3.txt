We introduce the primitivity of Fricke families, and give some examples. As its application, we first construct generators of the function field of the modular curve of level N in terms of Fricke functions and Siegel functions, respectively. Furthermore, we use the special values of a certain function in a totally primitive Fricke family of level N in order to generate ray class fields of imaginary quadratic fields.
