We show that the sum of the traces of Frobenius elements of Artin L-functions in a family of G-fields satisfies the Gaussian distribution under certain counting conjectures. We prove the counting conjectures for S_4 and S_5-fields. We also show central limit theorem for modular form L-functions with the trivial central character with respect to congruence subgroups as the level goes to infinity.
