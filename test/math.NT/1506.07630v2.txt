First we show that the abscissae of uniform and absolute convergence of Dirichlet series coincide in the case of L-functions from the Selberg class \mathcal{S}. We also study the latter abscissa inside the extended Selberg class, indicating a different behavior in the two classes. Next we address two questions about majorants of functions in \mathcal{S}, showing links with the distribution of the zeros and with independence results.
