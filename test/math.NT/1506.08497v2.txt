In this article, using the heat kernel approach from \cite{bouche}, we derive sup-norm bounds for cusp forms of integral and half integral weight. Let \Gamma\subset \mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{R}) be a cocompact Fuchsian subgroup of first kind. For k\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z} (or k\in 2\mathbb{Z}), let S^{k}(\Gamma) denote the complex vector space of weight-k cusp forms. Let \lbrace f_{1},\ldots,f_{j_{k}} \rbrace denote an orthonormal basis of S^{k}(\Gamma). In this article, we show that as k\rightarrow \infty, the sup-norm for \sum_{i=1}^{j_{k}}y^{k}|f_{i}(z)|^{2} is bounded by O(k), where the implied constant is independent on \Gamma. Furthermore, using results from \cite{berman}, we extend these results to the case when \Gamma is cofinite.
