We prove that for d \in \{ 2,3,5,7,13 \} and K a quadratic (or rational) field of discriminant D and Dirichlet character \chi, if a prime p is large enough compared to D, there is a newform f \in S_2(\Gamma_0(dp^2)) with sign (+1) with respect to the Atkin-Lehner involution w_{p^2} such that L(f \otimes \chi,1) \neq 0. This result is obtained through an estimate of a weighted sum of twists of L-functions which generalises a result of Ellenberg. It relies on the approximate functional equation for the L-functions L(f \otimes \chi, \cdot) and a Petersson trace formula restricted to Atkin-Lehner eigenspaces. An application of this nonvanishing theorem will be given in terms of existence of rank zero quotients of some twisted jacobians, which generalises a result of Darmon and Merel.
