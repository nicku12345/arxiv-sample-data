E. Bombieri and J. Pila introduced a method for bounding the number of integral lattice points that belong to a given arc under several assumptions. In this paper we generalize the Bombieri-Pila method to the case of function fields of genus 0 in one variable. We then apply the result to counting the number of elliptic curves contain in an isomorphism class and with coefficients in a box.
