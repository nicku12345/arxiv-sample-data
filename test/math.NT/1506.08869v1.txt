If we want to represent integers in base m, we need a set A of digits, which needs to be a complete set of residues modulo m. When adding two integers with last digits a_1, a_2 \in A, we find the unique a \in A such that a_1 + a_2 \equiv a mod m, and call (a_1 + a_2 -a)/m the carry. Carries occur also when addition is done modulo m^2, with A chosen as a set of coset representatives for the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}/m^2\mathbb{Z}. It is a natural to look for sets A which minimize the number of different carries. In a recent paper, Diaconis, Shao and Soundararajan proved that, when m=p, p prime, the only set A which induces two distinct carries, i. e. with A+A \subseteq \{ x, y \}+A for some x, y \in \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}, is the arithmetic progression [0, p-1], up to certain linear transformations. We present a generalization of the result above to the case of generic modulus m^2, and show how this is connected to the uniqueness of the representation of sets as a minimal number of arithmetic progression of same difference.
