Let \theta  be a Salem number and P(x) a polynomial with integer coefficients. It is well-known that the sequence (\theta^n) modulo 1 is dense but not uniformly distributed. In this article we discuss the sequence (P(\theta^n)) modulo 1. Our first approach is computational and consists in estimating the number of n so that the fractional part of (P(\theta^n)) falls into a subinterval of the partition of [0,1]. If Salem number is of degree 4 we can obtain explicit density function of the sequence, using an algorithm which is also given. Some examples confirm that these two approaches give the same result.
