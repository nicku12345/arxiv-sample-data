In this article we define an elliptic double shuffle Lie algebra ds_{ell} that generalizes the well-known double shuffle Lie algebra ds to the elliptic situation. The double shuffle, or dimorphic, relations satisfied by elements of the Lie algebra ds express two families of algebraic relations between multiple zeta values that conjecturally generate all relations. In analogy with this, elements of the elliptic double shuffle Lie algebra ds_{ell} are Lie polynomials having a dimorphic property called \Delta-bialternality that conjecturally describes the (dual of the) set of algebraic relations between elliptic multiple zeta values, periods of objects of the category MEM of mixed elliptic motives defined by Hain and Matsumoto. We show that one of Ecalle's major results in mould theory can be reinterpreted as yielding the existence of an injective Lie algebra morphism ds\rightarrow ds_{ell}. Our main result is the compatibility of this map with the tangential-base-point section {\rm Lie}\,\pi_1(MTM)\rightarrow {\rm Lie}\,\pi_1(MEM) constructed by Hain and Matsumoto and with the section grt\rightarrow grt_{ell} mapping the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra grt into the elliptic Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra grt_{ell} constructed by Enriquez.
