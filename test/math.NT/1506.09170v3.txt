Let E/\mathbb{Q} be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (CM), and for each prime p of good reduction, let a_E(p) = p + 1 - \#E(\mathbb{F}_p) denote the trace of Frobenius. By the Hasse bound, a_E(p) = 2\sqrt{p} \cos \theta_p for a unique \theta_p \in [0, \pi]. In this paper, we prove that the least prime p such that \theta_p \in [\alpha, \beta] \subset [0, \pi] satisfies \[ p \ll \left(\frac{N_E}{\beta - \alpha}\right)^A, \] where N_E is the conductor of E and the implied constant and exponent A > 2 are absolute and effectively computable. Our result is an analogue for CM elliptic curves of Linnik's Theorem for arithmetic progressions, which states that the least prime p \equiv a \pmod q for (a,q)=1 satisfies p \ll q^L for an absolute constant L > 0.
