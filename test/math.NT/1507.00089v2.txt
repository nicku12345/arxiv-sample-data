We prove a precise formula relating the Bessel period of certain automorphic forms on {\rm GSp}_{4}(\mathbb{A}_{F}) to a central L-value. This is a special case of the refined Gan--Gross--Prasad conjecture for the groups ({\rm SO}_{5},{\rm SO}_{2}) as set out by Ichino--Ikeda and Liu. This conjecture is deep and hard to prove in full generality; in this paper we succeed in proving the conjecture for forms lifted, via automorphic induction, from {\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{A}_{E}) where E is a quadratic extension of F. The case where E=F\times F has been previously dealt with by Liu.
