We study unilateral series in a single variable q where its exponent is an unbounded increasing function, and the coefficients are periodic. Such series converge inside the unit disk. Quadratic polynomials in the exponent correspond to partial theta series. We compute limits of those series as the variable tends radially to a root of unity. The proofs use ideas from the q-integral and are elementary.
