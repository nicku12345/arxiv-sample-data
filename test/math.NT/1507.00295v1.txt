We study the capitulation of 2-ideal classes of an infinite family of imaginary bicyclic biquadratic number fields consisting of fields \mathbf{k} =\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1p_2q}, i), where i=\sqrt{-1} and p_1\equiv p_2\equiv-q\equiv1 \pmod 4 are different primes. For each of the three quadratic extensions \mathbf{K}/\mathbf{k} inside the absolute genus field \mathbf{k}^{(*)} of \mathbf{k}, we compute the capitulation kernel of \mathbf{K}/\mathbf{k}. Then we deduce that each strongly ambiguous class of \mathbf{k}/\mathbb{Q}(i) capitulates already in \mathbf{k}^{(*)}, which is smaller than the relative genus field (\mathbf{k}/\mathbb{Q}(i))^*.
