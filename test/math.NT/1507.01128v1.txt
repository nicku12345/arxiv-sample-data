For a real number t, let s_t be the multiplicative arithmetic function defined by \displaystyle{s_t(p^{\alpha})=\sum_{j=0}^{\alpha}(-p^t)^j} for all primes p and positive integers \alpha. We show that the range of a function s_{-r} is dense in the interval (0,1] whenever r\in(0,1]. We then find a constant \eta_A\approx1.9011618 and show that if r>1, then the range of the function s_{-r} is a dense subset of the interval \displaystyle{\left(\frac{1}{\zeta(r)},1\right]} if and only if r\leq \eta_A. We end with an open problem.
