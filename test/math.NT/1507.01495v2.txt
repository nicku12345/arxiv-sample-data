For q a prime power, the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in \mathbb{F}_{q} consists in finding, for any g \in \mathbb{F}_{q}^{\times} and h \in \langle g \rangle, an integer x such that g^x = h. We present an algorithm for computing discrete logarithms with which we prove that for each prime p there exist infinitely many explicit extension fields \mathbb{F}_{p^n} in which the DLP can be solved in expected quasi-polynomial time. Furthermore, subject to a conjecture on the existence of irreducible polynomials of a certain form, the algorithm solves the DLP in all extensions \mathbb{F}_{p^n} in expected quasi-polynomial time.
