For an [n,k] Reed-Solomon code \mathcal{C}, it can be shown that any received word r lies a distance at most n-k from \mathcal{C}, denoted d(r,\mathcal{C})\leq n-k. Any word r meeting the equality is called a deep hole. Guruswami and Vardy (2005) showed that for a specific class of codes, determining whether or not a word is a deep hole is NP-hard. They suggested passingly that it may be easier when the evaluation set of \mathcal{C} is large or structured. Following this idea, we study the case where the evaluation set is the image of a Dickson polynomial, whose values appear with a special uniformity. To find families of received words that are not deep holes, we reduce to a subset sum problem (or equivalently, a Dickson polynomial-variation of Waring's problem) and find solution conditions by applying an argument using estimates on character sums indexed over the evaluation set.
