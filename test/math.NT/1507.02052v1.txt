Recently, several authors have studied the degenerate Bernoulli and Euler polynomials and given some intersting identities of those polynomials. In this paper, we consider the degenerate Bell numbers and polynomials and derive some new identities of those numbers and polynomials associated with special numbers and polynomials. In addition, we investigate some properties of the degenerate Bell polynomials which are derived by using the notion of composita. From our investigation, we give some new relations between the degenerate Bell polynomials and the special polynomials.
