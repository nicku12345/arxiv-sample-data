The Mazur principle give simple conditions for an irreducible unramified \overline{\mathbb{F}_l}-representation coming from a modular form of level \Gamma_0(Np) to come for some modular form of level \Gamma_0(N). The aim of this work is to give a generalization of this principle in higher dimension for some particular extended inner forms non quasi split of a unitary group studying the torsion cohomology classes of Shimura varieties of Kottwitz-Harris-Taylor type within its link with the local monodromy degeneracy.
