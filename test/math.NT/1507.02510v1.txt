In this note we prove algebraic independence results for the values of a special class of Mahler functions. In particular, the generating functions of Thue-Morse, regular paperfolding and Cantor sequences belong to this class, and we obtain the algebraic independence of the values of these functions at every non-zero algebraic point in the open unit disk. The proof uses results on Mahler's method.
