We obtain asymptotic formulas for the second and third moment of quadratic Dirichlet L--functions at the critical point, in the function field setting. We fix the ground field \mathbb{F}_q, and assume for simplicity that q is a prime with q \equiv 1 \pmod 4. We compute the second and third moment of L(1/2,\chi_D) when D is a monic, square-free polynomial of degree 2g+1, as g \to \infty. The answer we get for the second moment agrees with Andrade and Keating's conjectured formula. For the third moment, we check that the leading term agrees with the conjecture.
