For any real t, the unitary divisor function \sigma_t^* is the multiplicative arithmetic function defined by \sigma_t^*(p^{\alpha})=1+p^{\alpha t} for all primes p and positive integers \alpha. Let \overline{\sigma_t^*(\mathbb N)} denote the topological closure of the range \sigma_t^*. We calculate an explicit constant \eta^*\approx 1.9742550 and show that \overline{\sigma_{-r}^*(\mathbb N)} is connected if and only if r\in(0,\eta^*]. We end with an open problem.
