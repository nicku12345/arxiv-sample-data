We begin by defining functions \sigma_{t,k}, which are generalized divisor functions with restricted domains. For each positive integer k, we show that, for r>1, the range of \sigma_{-r,k} is a subset of the interval \displaystyle{\left[1,\frac{\zeta(r)}{\zeta((k+1)r)}\right)}. After some work, we define constants \eta_k which satisfy the following: If k\in\mathbb{N} and r>1, then the range of the function \sigma_{-r,k} is dense in \displaystyle{\left[1,\frac{\zeta(r)}{\zeta((k+1)r)}\right)} if and only if r\leq\eta_k. We end with an open problem.
