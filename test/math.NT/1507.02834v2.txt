In this paper we give simple expressions, involving binomials coefficients, for the value of c(n,k) modulo p^{v_p(n)}, when v_p(n) > 0. Here c(n,k) denotes a Stirling number of the first kind, and v_p(n) is the highest power of p dividing n.   As an application, we compute the Chern classes of permutation representations of cyclic groups.
