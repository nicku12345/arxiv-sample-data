In this paper, we introduce a new family of period integrals attached to irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations \sigma of symplectic groups \mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{A}), which detects the right-most pole of the L-function L(s,\sigma\times\chi) for some character \chi of F^\times\backslash\mathbb{A}^\times of order at most 2, and hence the occurrence of a simple global Arthur parameter (\chi,b) in the global Arthur parameter \psi attached to \sigma. We also give a characterisation of first occurrences of theta correspondence by (regularised) period integrals of residues of certain Eisenstein series.
