Let f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]; for each integer \alpha it is interesting to consider the number of iterates n_{\alpha}, if possible, needed to satisfy f^{n_{\alpha}}(\alpha) = \alpha. The sets \{\alpha, f(\alpha), \ldots, f^{n_{\alpha} - 1}(\alpha), \alpha\} generated by the iterates of f are called cycles. For \mathbb{Z}[x] it is known that cycles of length 1 and 2 occur, and no others. While much is known for extensions to number fields, we concentrate on extending \mathbb{Z} by adjoining reciprocals of primes. Let \mathbb{Z}[1/p_1, \ldots, 1/p_n] denote \mathbb{Z} extended by adding in the reciprocals of the n primes p_1, \ldots, p_n and all their products and powers with each other and the elements of \mathbb{Z}.   Interestingly, cycles of length 4, called 4-cycles, emerge for polynomials in \mathbb{Z}\left[1/p_1, \ldots, 1/p_n\right][x] under the appropriate conditions. The problem of finding criteria under which 4-cycles emerge is equivalent to determining how often a sum of four terms is zero, where the terms are \pm 1 times a product of elements from the list of n primes. We investigate conditions on sets of primes under which 4-cycles emerge. We characterize when 4-cycles emerge if the set has one or two primes, and (assuming a generalization of the ABC conjecture) find conditions on sets of primes guaranteed not to cause 4-cycles to emerge.
