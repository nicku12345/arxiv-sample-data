Let A be a Dedekind domain, K the fraction field of A, and f\in A[x] a monic irreducible separable polynomial. For a given non-zero prime ideal \mathfrak{p} of A we present in this paper a new method to compute a \mathfrak{p}-integral basis of the extension of K determined by f. Our method is based on the use of simple multipliers that can be constructed with the data that occurs along the flow of the Montes Algorithm. Our construction of a \mathfrak{p}-integral basis is significantly faster than the similar approach from [7] and provides in many cases a priori a triangular basis.
