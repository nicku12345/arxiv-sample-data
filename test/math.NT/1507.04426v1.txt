One of the main goals in this paper is to establish convolution sums of functions for the divisor sums \widetilde{\sigma}_s(n)=\sum_{d|n}(-1)^{d-1}d^s and \widehat{\sigma}_s(n)=\sum_{d|n}(-1)^{\frac{n}{d}-1}d^s, for certain s, which were first defined by Glaisher. We first introduce three functions \mathcal{P}(q), \mathcal{E}(q), and \mathcal{Q}(q) related to \widetilde{\sigma}(n), \widehat{\sigma}(n), and \widetilde{\sigma}_3(n), respectively, and then we evaluate them in terms of two parameters x and z in Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions. Using these formulas, we derive some identities from which we can deduce convolution sum identities. We discuss some formulae for determining r_s(n) and \delta_s(n), s=4, 8, in terms of \widetilde{\sigma}(n), \widehat{\sigma}(n), and \widetilde{\sigma}_3(n), where r_s(n) denotes the number of representations of n as a sum of s squares and \delta_s(n) denotes the number of representations of n as a sum of s triangular numbers. Finally, we find some partition congruences by using the notion of colored partitions.
