Under hypotheses required for the Taylor-Wiles method, we prove for forms of U(3) which are compact at infinity that the lattice structure on upper alcove algebraic vectors or on principal series types given by the \lambda-isotypic part of completed cohomology is a local invariant of the Galois representation attached to \lambda when this Galois representation is residually irreducible locally at places dividing p. As a crucial input, we establish corresponding mod p multiplicity one results. Our main innovation is the combination of integral Hecke theory and the Taylor--Wiles method.
