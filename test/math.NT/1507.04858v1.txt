Completely multiplicative functions whose sum is zero (CMO).The paper deals with CMO, meaning completely multiplicative (CM) functions f such that f(1)=1 and \sum\limits\_1^\infty f(n)=0. CM means f(ab)=f(a)f(b) for all (a,b)\in \N^{*2}, therefore f is well defined by the f(p), p prime. Assuming that f is CM, give conditions on the f(p), either necessary or sufficient, both is possible, for f being CMO : that is the general purpose of the authors.The CMO character of f is invariant under slight modifications of the sequence (f(p)) (theorem 3). The same idea applies also in a more general context (theorem 4).After general statements of that sort, including examples of CMO (theorem 5), the paper is devoted to "small" functions, that is, functions of the form \frac{f(n)}{n}, where the f(n) are bounded. Here is a typical result : if |f(p)|\le 1 and Re\, f(p)\le0 for all p, a necessary and sufficient condition for \big(\frac{f(n)}{n}\big) to be CMO is \sum \, Re\, f(p)/p=-\infty (theorem 8). Another necessary and sufficient condition is given under the assumption that |1+f(p)|\le 1 and f(2)\not=-2 (theorem 7). A third result gives only a sufficient condition (theorem 9). The three results apply to the particular case f(p)=-1, the historical example of Euler.Theorems 7 and 8 need auxiliary results, coming either from the existing literature (Hal\'asz, Montgomery--Vaughan), or from improved versions of classical results (Ingham, Ska{\l} ba) about f(n) under assumptions on the f*1(n), * denoting the multiplicative convolution (theorems 10 and 11).
