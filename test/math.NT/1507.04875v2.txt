We give a new construction of overconvergent modular forms of arbitrary weights, defining them in terms of functions on certain affinoid subsets of Scholze's infinite-level modular curve. These affinoid subsets, and a certain canonical coordinate on them, play a role in our construction which is strongly analogous with the role of the upper half-plane and its coordinate `z' in the classical analytic theory of modular forms. As one application of these ideas, we define and study an overconvergent Eichler-Shimura map in the context of compact Shimura curves over \mathbb{Q}, proving stronger analogues of results of Andreatta-Iovita-Stevens.
