Let K=\mathbb{Q}(\omega) with \omega the root of a degree n monic irreducible polynomial f\in\mathbb{Z}[X]. We show the degree n polynomial N(\sum_{i=1}^{n-k}x_i\omega^{i-1}) in n-k variables formed by setting the final k coefficients to 0 takes the expected asymptotic number of prime values if n\ge 4k. In the special case K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{\theta}), we show N(\sum_{i=1}^{n-k}x_i\sqrt[n]{\theta^{i-1}}) takes infinitely many prime values provided n\ge 22k/7.   Our proof relies on using suitable `Type I' and `Type II' estimates in Harman's sieve, which are established in a similar overall manner to the previous work of Friedlander and Iwaniec on prime values of X^2+Y^4 and of Heath-Brown on X^3+2Y^3. Our proof ultimately relies on employing explicit elementary estimates from the geometry of numbers and algebraic geometry to control the number of highly skewed lattices appearing in our final estimates.
