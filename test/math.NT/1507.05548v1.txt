We prove that for sets A, B, C \subset \mathbb{F}_p with |A|=|B|=|C| \leq \sqrt{p} and a fixed 0 \neq d \in \mathbb{F}_p holds      \max(|AB|, |(A+d)C|) \gg|A|^{1+1/26}.      In particular,      |A(A+1)| \gg |A|^{1 + 1/26}      and      \max(|AA|, |(A+1)(A+1)|) \gg |A|^{1 + 1/26}.      The first estimate improves the bound by Roche-Newton and Jones.   In the general case of a field of order q = p^m we obtain similar estimates with the exponent 1+1/559 + o(1) under the condition that AB does not have large intersection with any subfield coset, answering a question of Shparlinski.   Finally, we prove the estimate      \left| \sum_{x \in \mathbb{F}_q} \psi(x^n) \right| \ll q^{\frac{7 - 2\delta_2}{8}}n^{\frac{2+2\delta_2}{8}}      for Gauss sums over \mathbb{F}_q, where \psi is a non-trivial additive character and \delta_2 = 1/56 + o(1). The estimate gives an improvement over the classical Weil bound when q^{1/2} \ll n = o\left( q^{29/57 + o(1)} \right).
