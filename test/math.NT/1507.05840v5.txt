It is shown that the maximum of |\zeta(1/2+it)| on the interval T^{1/2}\le t \le T is at least \exp\left((1/\sqrt{2}+o(1)) \sqrt{\log T \log\log\log T/\log\log T}\right). Our proof uses Soundararajan's resonance method and a certain large GCD sum. The method of proof shows that the absolute constant A in the inequality \[ \sup_{1\le n_1<\cdots < n_N} \sum_{k,{\ell}=1}^N\frac{\gcd(n_k,n_{\ell})}{\sqrt{n_k n_{\ell}}} \ll N \exp\left(A\sqrt{\frac{\log N \log\log\log N}{\log\log N}}\right), \] established in a recent paper of ours, cannot be taken smaller than 1.
