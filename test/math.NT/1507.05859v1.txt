Let {\mathfrak o} be the ring of integers in a finite extension K of {\mathbb Q}_p, let k be its residue field. Let G be a split reductive group over {\mathbb   Q}_p, let T be a maximal split torus in G. Let {\mathcal   H}(G,I_0) be the pro-p-Iwahori Hecke {\mathfrak o}-algebra. Given a semiinfinite reduced chamber gallery (alcove walk) C^{({\bullet})} in the T-stable apartment, a period \phi\in N(T) of C^{({\bullet})} of length r and a homomorphism \tau:{\mathbb   Z}_p^{\times}\to T compatible with \phi, we construct a functor from the category {\rm   Mod}^{\rm fin}({\mathcal   H}(G,I_0)) of finite length {\mathcal   H}(G,I_0)-modules to \'{e}tale (\varphi^r,\Gamma)-modules over Fontaine's ring {\mathcal   O}_{\mathcal E}. If G={\rm GL}_{d+1}({\mathbb Q}_p) there are essentially two choices of (C^{({\bullet})}, \phi, \tau) with r=1, both leading to a functor from {\rm   Mod}^{\rm fin}({\mathcal   H}(G,I_0)) to \'{e}tale (\varphi,\Gamma)-modules and hence to {\rm   Gal}_{{\mathbb Q}_p}-representations. Both induce a bijection between the set of absolutely simple supersingular {\mathcal H}(G,I_0)\otimes_{\mathfrak o} k-modules of dimension d+1 and the set of irreducible representations of {\rm Gal}_{{\mathbb Q}_p} over k of dimension d+1. We also compute these functors on modular reductions of tamely ramified locally unitary principal series representations of G over K. For d=1 we recover Colmez' functor (when restricted to {\mathfrak o}-torsion {\rm   GL}_{2}({\mathbb Q}_p)-representations generated by their pro-p-Iwahori invariants)
