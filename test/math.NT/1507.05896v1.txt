The Somos-5 sequence is defined by a_{0} = a_{1} = a_{2} = a_{3} = a_{4} = 1 and a_{m} = \frac{a_{m-1} a_{m-4} + a_{m-2} a_{m-3}}{a_{m-5}} for m \geq 5. We relate the arithmetic of the Somos-5 sequence to the elliptic curve E : y^{2} + xy = x^{3} + x^{2} - 2x and use properties of Galois representations attached to E to prove the density of primes p dividing some term in the Somos-5 sequence is equal to \frac{5087}{10752}.
