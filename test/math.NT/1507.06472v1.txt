An important result of H. Weyl states that for every sequence \left(a_{n}\right)_{n\geq 1} of distinct positive integers the sequence of fractional parts of \left(a_{n} \alpha \right)_{n \geq1} is uniformly distributed modulo one for almost all \alpha. However, in general it is a very hard problem to calculate the precise order of convergence of the discrepancy D_{N} of \left(\left\{a_{n} \alpha \right\}\right)_{n \geq 1} for almost all \alpha. By a result of R. C. Baker this discrepancy always satisfies N D_{N} = \mathcal{O} \left(N^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}\right) for almost all \alpha and all \varepsilon >0. In the present note for arbitrary \gamma \in \left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right] we construct a sequence \left(a_{n}\right)_{n \geq 1} such that for almost all \alpha we have ND_{N} = \mathcal{O} \left(N^{\gamma}\right) and ND_{N} = \Omega \left(N^{\gamma-\varepsilon}\right) for all \varepsilon > 0, thereby proving that any prescribed metric discrepancy behavior within the admissible range can actually be realized.
