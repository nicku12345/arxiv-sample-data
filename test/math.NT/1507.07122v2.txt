Let E_1 and E_2 be \overline{\mathbb{Q}}-nonisogenous, semistable elliptic curves over \mathbb{Q}, having respective conductors N_{E_1} and N_{E_2} and both without complex multiplication. For each prime p, denote by a_{E_i}(p) := p+1-\#E_i(\mathbb{F}_p) the trace of Frobenius. Under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for the convolved symmetric power L-functions L(s, \mathrm{Sym}^i E_1\otimes\mathrm{Sym}^j E_2) where i,j\in\{0,1,2\}, we prove an explicit result that can be stated succinctly as follows: there exists a prime p\nmid N_{E_1}N_{E_2} such that a_{E_1}(p)a_{E_2}(p)<0 and   \[ p < \big( (32+o(1))\cdot \log N_{E_1} N_{E_2}\big)^2. \] This improves and makes explicit a result of Bucur and Kedlaya.   Now, if I\subset[-1,1] is a subinterval with Sato-Tate measure \mu and if the symmetric power L-functions L(s, \mathrm{Sym}^k E_1) are functorial and satisfy GRH for all k \le 8/\mu, we employ similar techniques to prove an explicit result that can be stated succinctly as follows: there exists a prime p\nmid N_{E_1} such that a_{E_1}(p)/(2\sqrt{p})\in I and   \[ p < \left((21+o(1)) \cdot \mu^{-2}\log (N_{E_1}/\mu)\right)^2. \]
