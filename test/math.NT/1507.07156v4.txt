We prove that L-functions from Langlands-Shahidi method in the case of GSpin groups over a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero are Artin L-functions through the local Langlands correspondence. It has an application on the proof of a weak version of the generic Arthur packet conjecture. Furthermore, we study and describe a local L-packet that contains a generic member in the case of GSpin groups. Using this description of a local L-packet, we strengthen a weak version of the generic Arthur packet conjecture in those cases (local version of the generalized Ramanujan conjecture).
