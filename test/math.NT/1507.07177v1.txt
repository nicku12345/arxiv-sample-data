We continue our investigations of the analytic properties of nonlinear twists of L-functions developed in [4],[5] and [7]. Given an L-function of degree d, we first extend the transformation formula in [5], relating a twist with leading exponent > 1/d to its dual twist. Then we combine the results in [7] with such a transformation formula to obtain the analytic properties of new classes of nonlinear twists. This allows to detect several new cases of resonance of the classical L-functions.
