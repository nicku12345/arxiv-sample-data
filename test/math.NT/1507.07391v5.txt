We prove three more general supercongruences between truncated hypergeometric series and p-adic Gamma function from which some known supercongruences follow. A supercongruence conjectured by Rodriguez-Villegas and proved by E. Mortenson using the theory of finite field hypergeometric series follows from one of our more general supercongruences. We also prove a supercongruence for {_7}F_6 truncated hypergeometric series which is similar to a supercongruence proved by L. Long and R. Ramakrishna.
