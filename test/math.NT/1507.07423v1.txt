One of the many interesting algebraic objects associated to a given rational elliptic curve, E, is its full-torsion representation \rho_E:\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbf{Q}}/\mathbf{Q})\to\mathrm{GL}_2(\hat{\mathbf{Z}}). Generalizing this idea, one can create another full-torsion Galois representation, \rho_{(E_1,E_2)}:\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbf{Q}}/\mathbf{Q})\to\left(\mathrm{GL}_2(\hat{\mathbf{Z}})\right)^2 associated to a pair (E_1,E_2) of rational elliptic curves. The goal of this paper is to provide an infinite number of concrete examples of pairs of elliptic curves whose associated full-torsion Galois representation \rho_{(E_1,E_2)} has maximal image. The size of the image is inversely related to the size of the intersection of various division fields defined by E_1 and E_2. The representation \rho_{(E_1,E_2)} has maximal image when these division fields are maximally disjoint, and most of the paper is devoted to studying these intersections.
