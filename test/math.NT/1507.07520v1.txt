A series of lecture notes on the elementary theory of algebraic numbers, using only knowledge of a first-semester graduate course in algebra (primarily groups and rings). No prerequisite knowledge of fields is required. Based primarily on the texts of E. Hecke, Lectures on the Theory of Algebraic Numbers, Springer-Verlag, 1981 (English translation by G. Brauer and J. Goldman) and D. Marcus, Number Fields, Springer, 1977.
