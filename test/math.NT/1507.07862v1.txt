For two arithmetical functions f and g with absolutely convergent Ramanujan expansions, Murty and Saha have recently derived asymptotic formulas with error term for the convolution sum \sum_{n \le N} f(n) g(n+h) under some suitable conditions (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01945). In this follow up article we improve these results with a weakened hypothesis which is in some sense minimal.
