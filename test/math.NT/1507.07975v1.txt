The generating function for p_N(n), the number of partitions of n into at most N parts, may be written as a product of N factors. We find the behavior of coefficients in the partial fraction decomposition of this product as N \to \infty by applying the saddle-point method, where the saddle-point we need is associated to a zero of the analytically continued dilogarithm. Our main result disproves a conjecture of Rademacher.
