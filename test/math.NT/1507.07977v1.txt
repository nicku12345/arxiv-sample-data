The generating function for p_N(n), the number of partitions of n into at most N parts, may be written as a product of N factors. In part I, we studied the behavior of coefficients in the partial fraction decomposition of this product as N \to \infty by applying the saddle-point method to get the asymptotics of the main terms. In this second part we bound the error terms. This involves estimating products of sines and further saddle-point arguments. The saddle-points needed are associated to zeros of the analytically continued dilogarithm.
