For any real number s, let \sigma_s be the generalized divisor function, i.e., the arithmetic function defined by \sigma_s(n) := \sum_{d \, \mid \, n} d^s, for all positive integers n. We prove that for any r > 1 the topological closure of \sigma_{-r}(\mathbf{N}^+) is the union of a finite number of pairwise disjoint closed intervals I_1, \ldots, I_\ell. Moreover, for k=1,\ldots,\ell, we show that the set of positive integers n such that \sigma_{-r}(n) \in I_k has a positive rational asymptotic density d_k. In fact, we provide a method to give exact closed form expressions for I_1, \ldots, I_\ell and d_1, \ldots, d_\ell, assuming to know r with sufficient precision. As an example, we show that for r = 2 it results \ell = 3, I_1 = [1, \pi^2/9], I_2 = [10/9, \pi^2/8], I_3 = [5/4, \pi^2 / 6], d_1 = 1/3, d_2 = 1/6, and d_3 = 1/2.
