Given two positive integers M and k, let \B_k be the set of bases q>1 such that there exists a real number x having exactly k different q-expansions over the alphabet \{0,1,\cdots,M\}. In this paper we investigate the smallest base q_2 of \B_2, and show that if M=2m the smallest base q_2 =\frac{m+1+\sqrt{m^2+2m+5}}{2}, and if M=2m-1 the smallest base q_2 is the appropriate root of  x^4=(m-1)\,x^3+2 m\, x^2+m \,x+1.  Moreover, for M=2 we show that q_2 is also the smallest base of \B_k for all k\ge 3. This turns out to be different from that for M=1.
