Let  (H_s(n))_{n \geq 1}  be an s-dimensional generalized Halton's sequence. Let \emph{D}^{*}_N be the discrepancy of the sequence  (H_s(n) )_{n = 1}^{N} . It is known that D^{*}_{N} =O(\ln^s N) as N \to \infty .   In this paper, we prove that this estimate is exact. Namely, there exists a constant C(H_s)>0, such that      \max_{1 \leq M \leq N}   M \emph{D}^{*}_{M} \geq C(H_s) \log_2^s N \quad {\rm for} \; \; N=2,3,... \; .
