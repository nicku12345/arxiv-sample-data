Suppose D is a suitably admissible compact subset of \mathbb{R}^k having a smooth boundary with possible zones of zero curvature. Let \mbox{R(T,\theta,x)= N(T,\theta,x) - T^{k}\mathrm{vol}(D),} where N(T,\theta,x) is the number of integral lattice points contained in an x-translation of T\theta(D), with T >0 a dilation parameter and \theta \in SO(k). Then R(T,\theta,x) can be regarded as a function with parameter T on the space E_{*}^{+}(k), where E_{*}^{+}(k) is the quotient of the direct Euclidean group by the subgroup of integral translations, and E_{*}^{+}(k) has a normalized invariant measure which is the product of normalized measures on SO(k) and the k-torus. We derive an integral estimate, valid for almost all (\theta,x) \in E_{*}^{+}(k), one consequence of which in two dimensions is that for almost all (\theta,x) \in E_{*}^{+}(2), a counterpart of the Hardy circle estimate \mbox{(1/T)\int_{1}^{T} |R(t,\theta,x)\,dt| \ll T^{\frac{1}{4} +\epsilon}\;}is valid with an improved estimate. We conclude with an account of hyperbolic versions for which, drawing on previous work of Hill and Parnovski \cite{hill-parnovski}, we give counterparts in all dimensions, for both the compact and non-compact finite volume cases.
