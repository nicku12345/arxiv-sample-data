The operator space analogue of the {\em strong form} of the principle of local reflexivity is shown to hold for any von Neumann algebra predual, and thus for any C^{*}-algebraic dual. This is in striking contrast to the situation for C^{*}-algebras, since, for example, K(H) does not have that property. The proof uses the Kaplansky density theorem together with a careful analysis of two notions of integrality for mappings of operator spaces.
