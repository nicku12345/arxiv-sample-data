We develop theory of multiplicity maps for compact quantum groups, as an application, we obtain a complete classification of right coideal C^*-algebras of C(SU_q(2)) for q\in [-1,1]\setminus \{0\}. They are labeled with Dynkin diagrams, but classification results for positive and negative cases of q are different. Many of the coideals are quantum spheres or quotient spaces by quantum subgroups, but we do have other ones in our classification list.
