We compute the monoid V(L_K(E)) of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective modules over certain graph algebras L_K(E), and we show that this monoid satisfies the refinement property and separative cancellation. We also show that there is a natural isomorphism between the lattice of graded ideals of L_K(E) and the lattice of order-ideals of V(L_K(E)). When K is the field \mathbb C of complex numbers, the algebra L_{\mathbb C}(E) is a dense subalgebra of the graph C^*-algebra C^*(E), and we show that the inclusion map induces an isomorphism between the corresponding monoids. As a consequence, the graph C*-algebra of any row-finite graph turns out to satisfy the stable weak cancellation property.
