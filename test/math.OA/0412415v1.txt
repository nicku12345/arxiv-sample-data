In [13] and [14], we found so-called the reccurence diagram. This paper is the application of such recurrence diagram. As a first application for the reccurence diagram, we will re-compute the well-known moment series of the generating opeator of the free group factor L(F_N). Also, we will compute the trivial L(F_1)-valued moment series of the generating operator of L(F_2). This result can be extended for the general case when we have L(F_N), instead of L(F_2). To study operator-valued moment series is to study the operator-valued distribution. By doing that, we can get some algebraic and combinatorial free probability information about the operator-valued distribution of certain random variables. So, this paper provides a good example for studying the operator-valued distribution.
