We associate to each discrete partial dynamical system a universal C*-algebra generated by partial isometries satisfying relations given by a Boolean algebra connected to the discrete partial dynamical system in question. We show that for symbolic dynamical systems like one-sided and two-sided shift spaces and topological Markov chains with an arbitrary state space the C*-algebras usually associated to them, can be obtained in this way.   As a consequence of this, we will be able to show that for two-sided shift spaces having a certain property, the crossed product of the two-sided shift space is a quotient of the C*-algebra associated to the corresponding one-sided shift space.
