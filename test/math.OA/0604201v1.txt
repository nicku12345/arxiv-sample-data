Matrix versions of some basic convexity inequalities are given. Further results on the same topic are proved in the recent papers on arxiv: 1. Hermitian operators and convex functions, 2. A concavity inequality for symmetric norms, 3. Eigenvalue inequalities for convex and log-convex functions (with Jaspal Singh AUJLA).
