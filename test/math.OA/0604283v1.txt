Given an r\times r complex matrix T, if T=U|T| is the polar decomposition of T, then, the Aluthge transform is defined by  \Delta(T)= |T|^{1/2} U |T |^{1/2}.  Let \Delta^{n}(T) denote the n-times iterated Aluthge transform of T, i.e. \Delta^{0}(T)=T and \Delta^{n}(T)=\Delta(\Delta^{n-1}(T)), n\in\mathbb{N}. We prove that the sequence \{\Delta^{n}(T)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} converges for every r\times r {\bf diagonalizable} matrix T. We show that the limit \Delta^{\infty}(\cdot) is a map of class C^\infty on the similarity orbit of a diagonalizable matrix, and %of class C^\infty on the (open and dense) set of r\times r matrices with r different eigenvalues.
