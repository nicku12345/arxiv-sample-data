The notion of compact quantum subgroup is revisited and an alternative definition is given. Induced representations are considered and a Frobenius reciprocity theorem is obtained. A relationship between ergodic actions of compact quantum groups on C*-algebras and topological transitivity is investigated. A sufficient condition for embedding such actions in quantum quotient spaces is obtained.
