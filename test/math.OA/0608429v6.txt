We prove that if a countable group \Gamma contains infinite commuting subgroups H, H'\subset \Gamma with H non-amenable and H' ``weakly normal'' in \Gamma, then any measure preserving \Gamma-action on a probability space which satisfies certain malleability, spectral gap and weak mixing conditions (e.g. a Bernoulli \Gamma-action) is cocycle superrigid. If in addition H' can be taken non-virtually abelian and \Gamma \curvearrowright X is an arbitrary free ergodic action while \Lambda \curvearrowright Y=\Bbb T^\Lambda is a Bernoulli action of an arbitrary infinite conjugacy class group, then any isomorphism of the associated II_1 factors L^\infty X \rtimes \Gamma \simeq L^\infty Y \rtimes \Lambda comes from a conjugacy of the actions.
