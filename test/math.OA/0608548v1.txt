This paper focuses on certain finite dimensional point derivations for the non-selfadjoint operator algebras corresponding to directed graphs. We begin by analyzing the derivations corresponding to full matrix representations of the tensor algebra of a directed graph. We determine when such a derivation is inner, and describe situations that give rise to non-inner derivations. We also analyze the situation when the derivation corresponds to a multiplicative linear functional.
