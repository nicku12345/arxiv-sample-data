On the space of (non-commutative) distributions of k-tuples of selfadjoint elements in a C^*-probability space D_c(k), one has an operation \freeplus of free additive convolution, and one can consider the subspace D_c^{inf-div} of distributions which are infinitely divisible with respect to this operation. The linearizing transform for free additive convolution is the R-transform. Thus, one has R_{\mu\freeplus\nu}=R_{\mu}+R_{\nu}. The eta-series \eta_{\mu} is the counterpart of R_{\mu} in the theory of Boolean convolution. We prove that the space of eta-series of distributions belonging to D_c(k) coincides with the space of R-transforms of distributions which are infinitely divisible with respect to free additive convolution. As a consequence of this fact, one can define a bijection B : D_c(k) \to D_c^{inf-div} via the formula R_{B(\mu)} = \eta_{\mu}, for all distributions \mu in D_c(k). We show that B is a multi-variable analogue of a bijection studied by Bercovici and Pata for k=1, and we prove a theorem about convergence in moments which parallels the Bercovici-Pata result. On the other hand we prove the formula B(\mu\freetimes\nu) = B(\mu) \freetimes B(\nu), with \mu,\nu considered in a space D^{alg}(k) containing D_c (k) where the operation of free multiplicative convolution \freetimes always makes sense. An equivalent reformulation for this equality is that \eta_{\mu\freetimes\nu}=\eta_{\mu} \freestar \eta_{\nu}, for all \mu,\nu\in D^{alg}(k). This shows that, in a certain sense, eta-series behave in the same way as R-transforms in connection to the operation of multiplication of free k-tuples of non-commutative random variables.
