Suppose that \calak is a C^*-algebra acting on a Hilbert space \calhk, and that \phi, \psi are mappings from \calak into B(\calhk) which are not assumed to be necessarily linear or continuous. A (\phi, \psi)-derivation is a linear mapping d: \calak \to B(\calhk) such that d(ab)=\phi(a)d(b)+d(a)\psi(b)\quad (a,b\in \calak). We prove that if \phi is a multiplicative (not necessarily linear) *-mapping, then every *-(\phi,\phi)-derivation is automatically continuous. Using this fact, we show that every *-(\phi,\psi)-derivation d from \calak into B(\calhk) is continuous if and only if the *-mappings \phi and \psi are left and right d-continuous, respectively.
