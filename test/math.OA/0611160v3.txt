We obtain new proofs with improved constants of the Khintchine-type inequality with matrix coefficients in two cases. The first case is the Pisier and Lust-Piquard noncommutative Khintchine inequality for p=1, where we obtain the sharp lower bound of \frac1{\sqrt{2}} in the complex Gaussian case and for the sequence of functions \{e^{i2^nt}\}_{n=1}^\infty . The second case is Junge's recent Khintchine-type inequality for subspaces of the operator space R\oplus C, which he used to construct a cb-embedding of the operator Hilbert space OH into the predual of a hyperfinite factor. Also in this case, we obtain a sharp lower bound of \frac1{\sqrt{2}} . As a consequence, it follows that any subspace of a quotient of (R\oplus C)^* is cb-isomorphic to a subspace of the predual of the hyperfinite factor of type III_1, with cb-isomorphism constant \leq \sqrt{2} . In particular, the operator Hilbert space OH has this property.
