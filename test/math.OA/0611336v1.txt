Can Boutet de Monvel's algebra on a compact manifold with boundary be obtained as the algebra \Psi^0(G) of pseudodifferential operators on some Lie groupoid G? If it could, the kernel {\mathcal G} of the principal symbol homomorphism would be isomorphic to the groupoid {C^*-algebra} C^*(G). While the answer to the above question remains open, we exhibit in this paper a groupoid G such that C^*(G) possesses an ideal {\mathcal I} isomorphic to {\mathcal G}. %ES, the kernel of the principal symbol homomorphism on Boutet de Monvel's algebra. In fact, we prove first that {\mathcal G}\simeq\Psi\otimes{\mathcal K} with the C^*-algebra \Psi generated by the zero order pseudodifferential operators on the boundary and the algebra \mathcal K of compact operators. As both \Psi\otimes \mathcal K and \mathcal I are extensions of C(S^*Y)\otimes {\mathcal{K}} by {\mathcal{K}} (S^*Y is the co-sphere bundle over the boundary) we infer from a theorem by Voiculescu that both are isomorphic.
