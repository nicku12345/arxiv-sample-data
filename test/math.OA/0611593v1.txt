Let X_i denote free identically-distributed random variables. This paper investigates how the norm of products \Pi_n=X_1 X_2 ... X_n behaves as n approaches infinity. In addition, for positive X_i it studies the asymptotic behavior of the norm of Y_n=X_1 \circ X_2 \circ ...\circ X_n, where \circ denotes the symmetric product of two positive operators: A \circ B=:A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}.   It is proved that if the expectation of X_i is 1, then the norm of the symmetric product Y_{n} is between c_1 n^{1/2} and c_2 n for certain constant c_1 and c_2. That is, the growth in the norm is at most linear.   For the norm of the usual product Pi_n, it is proved that the limit of n^{-1}\log Norm(Pi_n) exists and equals \log \sqrt{E(X_i^{\ast}X_{i})}. In other words, the growth in the norm of the product is exponential and the rate equals the logarithm of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of operator X.   Finally, if \pi  is a cyclic representation of the algebra generated by X_i, and if \xi is a cyclic vector, then n^{-1}\log Norm(\pi (\Pi_{n}) \xi)=\log \sqrt{E(X_{i}^{\ast}X_{i})} for all n. In other words, the growth in the length of the cyclic vector is exponential and the rate coincides with the rate in the growth of the norm of the product.   These results are significantly different from analogous results for commuting random variables and generalize results for random matrices derived by Kesten and Furstenberg.
