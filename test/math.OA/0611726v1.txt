We study multiplier algebras for a large class of Banach algebras which contains the group algebra L_1(G), the Beurling algebras L_1(G, \omega), and the Fourier algebra A(G) of a locally compact group G. This study yields numerous new results and unifies some existing theorems on L_1(G) and A(G) through an abstract Banach algebraic approach. Applications are obtained on representations of multipliers over locally compact quantum groups and on topological centre problems. In particular, five open problems in abstract harmonic analysis are solved.
