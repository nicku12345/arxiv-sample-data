We study a generalisation of operator spaces modelled on L_p spaces, instead of Hilbert spaces, using the notion of p-complete boundedness, as studied by Pisier and Le Merdy. We show that the Fig\'a-Talamanca-Herz Algebras A_p(G) becomes quantised Banach algebras in this framework, and that the cohomological notion of amenability of these algebras corresponds to amenability of the locally compact group G. We thus argue that we have presented a generalised of the use of operator spaces in studying the Fourier algebra A(G), in the spirit of Ruan. Finally, we show that various notions of multipliers of A_p(G) (including Herz's generalisation of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra) naturally fit into this framework.
