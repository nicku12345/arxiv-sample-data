Let (A,\Delta) be a locally compact quantum group and (A_0,\Delta_0) a regular multiplier Hopf algebra. We show that if (A_0,\Delta_0) can in some sense be imbedded in (A,\Delta), then A_0 will inherit some of the analytic structure of A. Under certain conditions on the imbedding, we will be able to conclude that (A_0,\Delta_0) is actually an algebraic quantum group with a full analytic structure. The techniques used to show this, can be applied to obtain the analytic structure of a ^*-algebraic quantum group {\it in a purely algebraic fashion}. Moreover, the {\it reason} that this analytic structure exists at all, is that the one-parameter groups, such as the modular group and the scaling group, are diagonizable. In particular, we will show that necessarily the scaling constant \mu of a ^*-algebraic quantum group equals 1. This solves an open problem.
