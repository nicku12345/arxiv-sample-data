This note concerns uniform equicontinuity of families of operators on a separable Hilbert space H, and of families of maps on B(H). It is shown that a one parameter group of automorphisms is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if the group of unitaries which implements it is so. A "geometrical" necessary and sufficient condition is given for a family of operators to be uniformly equicontinuous.
