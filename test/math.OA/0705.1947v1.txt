Let \A be a finite subdiagonal algebra in Arveson's sense. Let H^p(\A) be the associated noncommutative Hardy spaces, 0<p\le\8. We extend to the case of all positive indices most recent results about these spaces, which include notably the Riesz, Szeg\"o and inner-outer type factorizations. One new tool of the paper is the contractivity of the underlying conditional expectation on H^p(\A) for p<1.
