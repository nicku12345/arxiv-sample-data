This paper studies the relationship between vector-valued BMO functions and the Carleson measures defined by their gradients. Let dA and dm denote Lebesgue measures on the unit disc D and the unit circle \mathbb T, respectively. For 1< q<\infty and a Banach space B we prove that there exists a positive constant c such that   \sup_{z_0\in D}\int_{D}(1-|z|)^{q-1}\|\nabla f(z)\|^q   P_{z_0}(z) dA(z)   \le c^q\sup_{z_0\in D}\int_{\T}\|f(z)-f(z_0)\|^qP_{z_0}(z) dm(z) holds for all trigonometric polynomials f with coefficients in B iff B admits an equivalent norm which is q-uniformly convex, where   P_{z_0}(z)=\frac{1-|z_0|^2}{|1-\bar{z_0}z|^2} . The validity of the converse inequality is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent q-uniformly smooth norm.
