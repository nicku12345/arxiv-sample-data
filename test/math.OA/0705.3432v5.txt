A locally compact group G is amenable if and only if it has Reiter's property (P_p) for p=1 or, equivalently, all p \in [1,\infty), i.e., there is a net (m_\alpha)_\alpha of non-negative norm one functions in L^p(G) such that \lim_\alpha \sup_{x \in K} \| L_{x^{-1}} m_\alpha - m_\alpha \|_p = 0 for each compact subset K \subset G (L_{x^{-1}} m_\alpha stands for the left translate of m_\alpha by x^{-1}). We extend the definitions of properties (P_1) and (P_2) from locally compact groups to locally compact quantum groups in the sense of J. Kustermans and S. Vaes. We show that a locally compact quantum group has (P_1) if and only if it is amenable and that it has (P_2) if and only if its dual quantum group is co-amenable. As a consequence, (P_2) implies (P_1).
