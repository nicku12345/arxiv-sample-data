We introduce the notion of strong Morita equivalence for group actions on locally C*-algebras and prove that the crossed products associated with two strongly Morita equivalent continuous inverse limit actions of a locally compact group G on the locally C*-algebras A and B are strongly Morita equivalent. This generalizes a result of F. Combes, Proc. London Math. Soc. 49(1984) and R. E. Curto, P.S. Muhly, D. P. Williams, Proc. Amer. Soc. 90(1984).
