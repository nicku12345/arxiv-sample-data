Quantum double construction, originally due to Drinfeld and has been since generalized even to the operator algebra framework, is naturally associated with a certain (quasitriangular) R-matrix {\mathcal R}. It turns out that {\mathcal R} determines a twisting of the comultiplication on the quantum double. It then suggests a twisting of the algebra structure on the dual of the quantum double. For D(G), the C^*-algebraic quantum double of an ordinary group G, the "twisted \hat{D(G)}" turns out to be the Weyl algebra C_0(G)\times_{\tau}G, which is in turn isomorphic to {\mathcal K}(L^2(G)). This is the C^*-algebraic counterpart to an earlier (finite-dimensional) result by Lu. It is not so easy technically to extend this program to the general locally compact quantum group case, but we propose here some possible approaches, using the notion of the (generalized) Fourier transform.
