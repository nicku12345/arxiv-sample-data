It has been established by Inoue that a complex locally C*-algebra with a dense ideal posesses a bounded approximate identity which belonges to that ideal. It has been shown by Fritzsche that if a unital complex locally C*-algebra has an unbounded element then it also has a dense one-sided ideal. In the present paper we obtain analogues of the aforementioned results of Inoue and Fritzsche for real locally C*-algebras (projective limits of projective families of real C*-algebras), and for locally JB-algebras (projective limits of projective families of JB-algebras).
