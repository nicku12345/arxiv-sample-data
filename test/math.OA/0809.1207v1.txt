Let \Op_t(a), for t\in \mathbf R, be the pseudo-differential operator  f(x) \mapsto (2\pi)^{-n}\iint a((1-t)x+ty,\xi)f(y)e^{i\scal {x-y}\xi} dyd\xi  and let \mathscr I_p be the set of Schatten-von Neumann operators of order p\in [1,\infty ] on L^2. We are especially concerned with the Weyl case (i.{}e. when t=1/2). We prove that if m and g are appropriate metrics and weight functions respectively, h_g is the Planck's function, h_g^{k/2}m\in L^p for some k\ge 0 and a\in S(m,g), then \Op_t(a)\in \mathscr I_p, iff a\in L^p. Consequently, if 0\le \delta <\rho \le 1 and a\in S^r_{\rho ,\delta}, then \Op_t(a) is bounded on L^2, iff a\in L^\infty.
