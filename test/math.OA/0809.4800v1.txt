A measurable map T on a measure space induces a representation \Pi_{T} of a Cuntz algebra {\cal O}_{N} when T satisfies a certain condition. For such two maps \tau and \sigma and representations \Pi_{\tau} and \Pi_{\sigma} associated with them, we show that \Pi_{\tau} is the restriction of \Pi_{\sigma} when \tau is a jump transformation of \sigma. Especially, the Gauss map \tau_1 and the Farey map \sigma_1 induce representations \Pi_{\tau_1} of {\cal O}_{\infty} and that \Pi_{\sigma_1} of {\cal O}_{2}, respectively, and \Pi_{\tau_1}=\Pi_{\sigma_1}|_{{\cal O}_{\infty}} with respect to a certain embedding of {\cal O}_{\infty} into {\cal O}_{2}.
