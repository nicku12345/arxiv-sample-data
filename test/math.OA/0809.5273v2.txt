We consider unital simple inductive limits of generalized dimension drop C*-algebras They are so-called ASH-algebras and include all unital simple AH-algebras and all dimension drop C^*-algebras. Suppose that A is one of these C*-algebras. We show that A\otimes Q has tracial rank no more than one, where Q is the rational UHF-algebra. As a consequence, we obtain the following classification result: Let A and B be two unital simple inductive limits of generalized dimension drop algebras with no dimension growth. Then A\cong B if and only if they have the same Elliott invariant.
