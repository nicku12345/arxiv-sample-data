We consider the limiting distribution of U_NA_NU_N^* and B_N (and more general expressions), where A_N and B_N are N \times N matrices with entries in a unital C^*-algebra \mathcal B which have limiting \mathcal B-valued distributions as N \to \infty, and U_N is a N \times N Haar distributed quantum unitary random matrix with entries independent from \mathcal B. Under a boundedness assumption, we show that U_NA_NU_N^* and B_N are asymptotically free with amalgamation over \mathcal B. Moreover, this also holds in the stronger infinitesimal sense of Belinschi-Shlyakhtenko.   We provide an example which demonstrates that this example may fail for classical Haar unitary random matrices when the algebra \mathcal B is infinite-dimensional.
