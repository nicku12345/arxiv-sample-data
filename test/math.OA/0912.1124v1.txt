We show that if p:\B\to G is a Fell bundle over a locally compact groupoid G and that A=\Gamma_{0}(G^{(0)};\B) is the \cs-algebra sitting over G^{(0)}, then there is a continuous G-action on \Prim A that reduces to the usual action when \B comes from a dynamical system. As an application, we show that if I is a G-invariant ideal in A, then there is a short exact sequence of \cs-algebras \xymatrix{0\ar[r]&\cs(G,\BI)\ar[r] &\cs(G,\B)\ar[r]&\cs(G,\BqI)\ar[r]&0,} where \cs(G,\B) is the Fell bundle \cs-algebra and \BI and \BqI are naturally defined Fell bundles corresponding to I and A/I, respectively. Of course this exact sequence reduces to the usual one for \cs-dynamical systems.
