We show how to extend a classic Morita Equivalence Result of Green's to the \cs-algebras of Fell bundles over transitive groupoids. Specifically, we show that if p:\B\to G is a saturated Fell bundle over a transitive groupoid G with stability group H=G(u) at u\in \go, then \cs(G,\B) is Morita equivalent to \cs(H,\CC), where \CC=\B\restr H. As an application, we show that if p:\B\to G is a Fell bundle over a group G and if there is a continuous G-equivariant map \sigma:\Prim A\to G/H, where A=B(e) is the \cs-algebra of \B and H is a closed subgroup, then \cs(G,\B) is Morita equivalent to \cs(H,\CC^{I}) where \CC^{I} is a Fell bundle over H whose fibres are A/I\sme A/I-\ib s and I=\bigcap\set{P:\sigma(P)=eH}. Green's result is a special case of our application to bundles over groups.
