In this short note we show how the higher index theory can be used to prove results concerning the non-existence of complete riemannian metric with uniformly positive scalar curvature at infinity. By improving some classical results due to M. Gromov and B. Lawson we show the efficiency of these methods in dealing with such non-existence theorems.
