Let G be a finitely generated discrete group. The standard spectral triple on the group C*-algebra C*(G) is shown to admit the quantum group of orientation preserving isometries. This leads to new examples of compact quantum groups. In particular the quantum isometry group of the C*-algebra of the free group on n-generators is computed and turns out to be a quantum group extension of the quantum permutation group A_{2n} of Wang. The quantum groups of orientation and real structure preserving isometries are also considered and construction of the Laplacian for the standard spectral triple on C*(G) discussed.
