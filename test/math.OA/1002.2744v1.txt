In this paper we present a conjecture on intermediate subfactors which is a generalization of Wall's conjecture from the theory of finite groups. Motivated by this conjecture, we determine all intermediate subfactors of Goodman-Harpe-Jones subfactors, and as a result we verify that Goodman-Harpe-Jones subfactors verify our conjecture. Our result also gives a negative answer to a question motivated by a conjecture of Aschbacher-Guralnick.
