This article focuses on properties of monotone convolutions. A criterion for infinite divisibility and time evolution of convolution semigroups are mainly studied. In particular, we clarify that many analogues of the classical results of L\'{e}vy processes hold such as characterizations of subordinators and strictly stable distributions.
