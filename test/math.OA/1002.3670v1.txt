This paper is devoted to the study of \Phi-moment inequalities for noncommutative martingales. In particular, we prove the noncommutative \Phi-moment analogues of martingale transformations, Stein's inequalities, Khintchine's inequalities for Rademacher's random variables, and Burkholder-Gundy's inequalities. The key ingredient is a noncommutative version of Marcinkiewicz type interpolation theorem for Orlicz spaces which we establish in this paper.
