Let M be a separable compact Hausdorff space with \dim M\le 2 and \theta\colon M\to M be a homeomorphism with prime period p (p\ge 2). Set M_\theta=\{x\in M| \theta(x)=x\}\not=\varnothing and M_0=M\backslash M_\theta. Suppose that M_0 is dense in M and \mathrm H^2(M_0/\theta,\Z)\cong 0, \mathrm H^2(\chi(M_0/\theta),\Z)\cong 0. Let M' be another separable compact Hausdorff space with \dim M'\le 2 and \theta' be the self--homeomorphism of M' with prime period p. Suppose that M_0'=M'\backslash M_{\theta'}' is dense in M'. Then C(M)\times_\theta\Z_p\cong C(M')\times_{\theta'}\Z_p iff there is a homeomorphism F from M/\theta onto M'/\theta' such that F(M_\theta)=M'_{\theta'}. Thus, if (M,\theta) and (M',\theta') are orbit equivalent, then C(M)\times_\theta\Z_p\cong C(M')\times_{\theta'}\Z_p.
