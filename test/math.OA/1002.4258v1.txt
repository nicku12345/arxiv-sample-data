Let \Gamma be a finitely generated discrete exact group. We consider operators on l^2(\Gamma) which are composed by operators of multiplication by a function in l^\infty (\Gamma) and by the operators of left-shift by elements of \Gamma. These operators generate a C^*-subalgebra of L(l^2(\Gamma)) the elements of which we call band-dominated operators on \Gamma. We study the stability of the finite sections method for band-dominated operators with respect to a given generating system of \Gamma. Our approach is based on the equivalence of the stability of a sequence and the Fredholmness of an associated operator, and on Roe's criterion for the Fredholmness of a band-dominated operator on a exact discrete group, which we formulate in terms of limit operators. Special emphasis is paid to the quasicommutator ideal of the algebra generated by the finite sections sequences and to the stability of sequences in that algebra. For both problems, the sequence of the discrete boundaries plays an essential role.
