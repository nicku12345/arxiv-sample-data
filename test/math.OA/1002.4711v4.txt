In the given article it is introduced new notions of a C^*-algebra of von Neumann type I and C^*-algebras of types I_n, II, II_1, II_\infty and III. It is proved that any GCR-algebra is a C^*-algebra of von Neumann type I, and a C^*-algebra is an NGCR-algebra if and only if this C^*-algebra does not have a nonzero Abelian annihilator. Also an analog of the theorem on decomposition of a von Neumann algebra to subalgebras of types I, II and III is proved. In the final part it is proved that every C^*-factor of von Neumann type I is a C^*-algebra of type I_n for some cardinal number n, every simple C^*-algebra of type II_1 is finite, every simple purely infinite C^*-algebra is of type III and every W^*-factor of type II_\infty has a simple C^*-subalgebra of type II_\infty. Finally it is formulated a classification theorem for C^*-factors.
