One of the major questions in the theory of Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space over the unit disk \mathbb D in the complex plane \mathbb C is a complete description of the commutant of a given Toeplitz operator, that is the set of all Toeplitz operators that commute with it. In \cite{l}, the first author obtained a complete description of the commutant of Toeplitz operator T with any quasihomogeneous symbol \phi(r)e^{ip\theta}, p>0 in case it has a Toeplitz p-th root S with symbol \psi(r)e^{i\theta}, namely, commutant of T is the closure of the linear space generated by powers S^n which are Toeplitz. But the existence of p-th root was known until now only when \phi(r)=r^m,m \geq 0. In this paper we will show the existence of p-th roots for a much larger class of symbols, for example, it includes such symbols for which \phi(r)=\sum_{i=1}^kr^{a_i}(\ln r)^{b_i},0\leq a_i, b_i for all 1\leq i\leq k .
