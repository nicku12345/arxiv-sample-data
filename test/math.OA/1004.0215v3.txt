A result of Gilbert shows that every completely bounded multiplier f of the Fourier algebra A(G) arises from a pair of bounded continuous maps \alpha,\beta:G \rightarrow K, where K is a Hilbert space, and f(s^{-1}t) = (\beta(t)|\alpha(s)) for all s,t\in G. We recast this in terms of adjointable operators acting between certain Hilbert C^*-modules, and show that an analogous construction works for completely bounded left multipliers of a locally compact quantum group. We find various ways to deal with right multipliers: one of these involves looking at the opposite quantum group, and this leads to a proof that the (unbounded) antipode acts on the space of completely bounded multipliers, in a way which interacts naturally with our representation result. The dual of the universal quantum group (in the sense of Kustermans) can be identified with a subalgebra of the completely bounded multipliers, and we show how this fits into our framework. Finally, this motivates a certain way to deal with two-sided multipliers.
