We conjecture an explicit formula for the higher dimensional Dirichlet character; the formula is based on the K-theory of the so-called noncommutative tori. It is proved, that our conjecture is true for the two-dimensional and one-dimensional (degenerate) noncommutative tori; in the second case, one gets a noncommutative analog of the Artin reciprocity law.
