In this paper we solve several problems concerning joint similarity to n-tuples of operators in noncommutative varieties in [B(\cH)^n]_1 associated with positive regular free holomorphic functions in n noncommuting variables and with sets of noncommutative polynomials in n indeterminates, where B(\cH) is the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space \cH. In particular, if f=X_1+...+X_n and \cP=\{0\}, the elements of the corresponding variety can be seen as noncommutative multivariable analogues of Agler's m-hypercontractions.
