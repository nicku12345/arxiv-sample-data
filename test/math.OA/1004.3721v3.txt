We establish the MF property of the reduced group  C^* -algebra of an amalgamated free product of countable Abelian discrete groups. This result is then used to give a characterization of the amalgamated free products of Abelian groups for which the BDF semigroup of the reduced group  C^* -algebra is a group. Along the way we get a tensor product factorization of the corresponding group von Neumann algebra. We end the exposition by applying the ideas from the first part to give a few more examples of groups with a reduced group  C^* -algebra which is MF.
