In the paper "Maps preserving the spectrum of generalized Jordan product of operators", we define a generalized Jordan products on standard operator algebras A_1, A_2 on complex Banach spaces X_1, X_2, respectively. This includes the usual Jordan product A_1 \circ A_2 = A_1 A_2 + A_2 A_1, and the triple \{A_1,A_2,A_3\} = A_1 A_2 A_3 + A_3 A_2 A_1. Let a map \Phi : A_1 \to A_2 prserving the spectra of the products  \sigma (\Phi (A_1) \circ ... \circ \Phi (A_k)) = \sigma (A_1\circ ... \circ A_k)  whenever any one of A_1, ..., A_k has rank at most one. It is shown in this paper that if the range of \Phi  contains all operators of rank at most three, then \Phi  must be a Jordan isomorphism multiplied by an mth root of unity. Similar results for maps between self-adjoint operators acting on Hilbert spaces are also obtained.   After our paper "Maps preserving the spectrum of generalized Jordan product of operators" was published in Linear Algebra Appl. 432 (2010), 1049-1069, Jianlian Cui pointed out that some arguments in the proof of Theorem 3.1 are not entirely clear and accurate. Here we supply some details in the "Addendum".
