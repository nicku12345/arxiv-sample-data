We define a canonical relative commutant planar algebra from a strongly Markov inclusion of finite von Neumann algebras. In the case of a connected unital inclusion of finite dimensional C*-algebras with the Markov trace, we show this planar algebra is isomorphic to the bipartite graph planar algebra of the Bratteli diagram of the inclusion. Finally, we show that a finite depth subfactor planar algebra is a planar subalgebra of the bipartite graph planar algebra of its principal graph.
