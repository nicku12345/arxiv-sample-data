The Proper Forcing Axiom implies all automorphisms of every Calkin algebra associated with an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space and the ideal of compact operators are inner. As a means of the proof we introduce the notion of Polish \omega_1-trees and cohrerent families of Polish spaces and prove some uniformization results.
