We study KMS states on finite-graph C*-algebras with sinks and sources. We compare finite-graph C*-algebras with C*-algebras associated with complex dynamical systems of rational functions. We show that if the inverse temperature \beta is large, then the set of extreme \beta-KMS states is parametrized by the set of sinks of the graph. This means that the sinks of a graph correspond to the branched points of a rational funcition from the point of KMS states. Since we consider graphs with sinks and sources, left actions of the associated bimodules are not injective. Then the associated graph C*-algebras are realized as (relative) Cuntz-Pimsner algebras studied by Katsura. We need to generalize Laca-Neshevyev's theorem of the construction of KMS states on Cuntz-Pimsner algebras to the case that left actions of bimodules are not injective.
