Let A be a C^*-algebra and I be a closed ideal in A. For x\in A, its image under the canonical surjection A\to A/I is denoted by \dot x, and the spectral radius of x is denoted by r(x). We prove that \max\{r(x), \|\dot x\|\} = \inf \|(1+i)^{-1}x(1+i)\| (where infimum is taken over all i\in I such that 1+i is invertible), which generalizes spectral radius formula of Murphy and West \cite{MurphyWest} (Rota for \mathcal{B(H)} \cite{Rota}). Moreover if r(x)< \|\dot x\| then the infimum is attained. A similar result is proved for commuting family of elements of a C^*-algebra. Using this we give a partial answer to an open question of C. Olsen: if p is a polynomial then for "almost every" operator T\in B(H) there is a compact perturbation T+K of T such that \|p(T+K)\| = \|p(T)\|_e.   We show also that if operators A,B commute, A is similar to a contraction and B is similar to a strict contraction then they are simultaneously similar to contractions.
