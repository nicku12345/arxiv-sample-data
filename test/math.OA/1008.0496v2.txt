Algebras associated with Quantum Electrodynamics and other gauge theories share some mathematical features with T-duality Exploiting this different perspective and some category theory, the full algebra of fermions and bosons can be regarded as a braided Clifford algebra over a braided commutative boson algebra, sharing much of the structure of ordinary Clifford algebras.
