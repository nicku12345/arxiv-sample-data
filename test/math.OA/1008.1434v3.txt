Suppose that \mathscr{A} is an operator algebra on a Hilbert space H. An element V in \mathscr{A} is called an all-derivable point of \mathscr{A} for the strong operator topology if every strong operator topology continuous derivable mapping \phi at V is a derivation. Let \mathscr{N} be a complete nest on a complex and separable Hilbert space H. Suppose that M belongs to \mathscr{N} with \{0\}\neq M\neq\ H and write \hat{M} for M or M^{\bot}. Our main result is: for any \Omega\in alg\mathscr{N} with \Omega=P(\hat{M})\Omega P(\hat{M}), if \Omega |_{\hat{M}} is invertible in alg\mathscr{N}_{\hat{M}}, then \Omega is an all-derivable point in alg\mathscr{N} for the strong operator topology.
