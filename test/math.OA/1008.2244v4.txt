Let \sS be a countable, abelian semigroup of continuous surjections on a compact metric space X. Corresponding to this dynamical system we associate two operator algebras, the tensor algebra, and the semicrossed product. There is a unique smallest C^*-algebra into which an operator algebra is completely isometrically embedded, which is the C^*-envelope. We provide two distinct characterizations of the C^*-envelope of the tensor algebra; one developed in a general setting by Katsura, and the other using tools of projective and inductive limits, which gives the C^*-envelope as a crossed product C^*-algebra. We also study two natural classes of representations, the left regular representations and the orbit representations. The first is Shilov, and the second has a Shilov resolution.
