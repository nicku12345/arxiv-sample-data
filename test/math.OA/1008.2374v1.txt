Let \A be a unital operator algebra and let \alpha be an automorphism of \A that extends to a *-automorphism of its \ca-envelope \cenv (\A). In this paper we introduce the isometric semicrossed product \A \times_{\alpha}^{\is} \bbZ^+  and we show that \cenv(\A \times_{\alpha}^{\is} \bbZ^+) \simeq \cenv (\A) \times_{\alpha} \bbZ. In contrast, the \ca-envelope of the familiar contractive semicrossed product \A \times_{\alpha} \bbZ^+  may not equal \cenv (\A) \times_{\alpha} \bbZ. Our main tool for calculating \ca-envelopes for semicrossed products is the concept of a relative semicrossed product of an operator algebra, which we explore in the more general context of injective endomorphisms.   As an application, we extend a recent result of Davidson and Katsoulis to tensor algebras of \ca-correspondences. We show that if \T_{\X}^{+} is the tensor algebra of a \ca-correspondence (\X, \fA) and \alpha a completely isometric automorphism of \T_{\X}^{+} that fixes the diagonal elementwise, then the contractive semicrossed product satisfies  \cenv(\T_{\X}^{+} \times_{\alpha} \bbZ^+)\simeq \O_{\X} \times_{\alpha} \bbZ, where \O_{\X} denotes the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of (\X, \fA).
