Normality of bounded and unbounded adjointable operators are discussed. Suppose T is an adjointable operator between Hilbert C*-modules which has polar decomposition, then T is normal if and only if there exists a unitary operator  \mathcal{U} which commutes with T and T^* such that T=\mathcal{U} \, T^*. Kaplansky's theorem for normality of the product of bounded operators is also reformulated in the framework of Hilbert C*-modules.
