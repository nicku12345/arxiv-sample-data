Let A be a homogeneous C*-algebra and \phi a state on A. We show that if \phi satisfies a certain faithfulness condition, then there is a net of finite-rank, unital completely positive, \phi-preserving maps on A that tend to the identity pointwise. This combined with results of Ricard and Xu show that the reduced free product of homogeneous C*-algebras with respect to these states have the completely contractive approximation property. We also give an example of a faithful state on M_2\otimes C[0,1] for which no such state-preserving approximation of the identity map exists, thus answering a question of Ricard and Xu.
