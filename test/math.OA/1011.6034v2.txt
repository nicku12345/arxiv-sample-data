Let {\Bbb F}_{n} be the free group of rank n and let \bigoplus C^{*}({\Bbb F}_{n}) denote the direct sum of full group C^{*}-algebras C^{*}({\Bbb F}_{n}) of {\Bbb F}_{n} (1\leq n<\infty). We introduce a new comultiplication \Delta_{\varphi} on \bigoplus C^{*}({\Bbb F}_{n}) such that (\bigoplus C^{*}({\Bbb F}_{n}),\,\Delta_{\varphi}) is a non-cocommutative C^{*}-bialgebra. With respect to \Delta_{\varphi}, the tensor product \pi\otimes_{\varphi}\pi' of any two representations \pi and \pi' of free groups is defined. The operation \ptimes is associative and non-commutative. We compute its tensor product formulas of several representations.
