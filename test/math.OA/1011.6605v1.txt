We establish a general operator parallelogram law concerning a characterization of inner product spaces, get an operator extension of Bohr's inequality and present several norm inequalities. More precisely, let {\mathfrak A} be a C^*-algebra, T be a locally compact Hausdorff space equipped with a Radon measure \mu and let (A_t)_{t\in T} be a continuous field of operators in {\mathfrak A} such that the function t \mapsto A_t is norm continuous on T and the function t \mapsto \|A_t\| is integrable. If \alpha: T \times T \to \mathbb{C} is a measurable function such that \bar{\alpha(t,s)}\alpha(s,t)=1 for all t, s \in T, then we show that \begin{align*} \int_T\int_T&\left|\alpha(t,s) A_t-\alpha(s,t) A_s\right|^2d\mu(t)d\mu(s)+\int_T\int_T\left|\alpha(t,s) B_t-\alpha(s,t) B_s\right|^2d\mu(t)d\mu(s) \nonumber &= 2\int_T\int_T\left|\alpha(t,s) A_t-\alpha(s,t) B_s\right|^2d\mu(t)d\mu(s) - 2\left|\int_T(A_t-B_t)d\mu(t)\right|^2\,. \end{align*}
