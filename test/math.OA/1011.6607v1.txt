We establish several operator versions of the classical Aczel inequality. One of operator versions deals with the weighted operator geometric mean and another is related to the positive sesquilinear forms. Some applications including the unital positive linear maps on C^*-algebras and the unitarily invariant norms on matrices are presented.
