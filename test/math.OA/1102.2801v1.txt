This paper studies the relationship between minimal dynamical systems on the product of the Cantor set (X) and torus (\T^2) and their corresponding crossed product C^*-algebras.   For the case when the cocycles are rotations, we studied the structure of the crossed product C^*-algebra A by looking at a large subalgebra A_x. It is proved that, as long as the cocycles are rotations, the tracial rank of the crossed product C^*-algebra is always no more than one, which then indicates that it falls into the category of classifiable C^*-algebras.   If a certain rigidity condition is satisfied, it is shown that the crossed product C^*-algebra has tracial rank zero. Under this assumption, it is proved that for two such dynamical systems, if A and B are the corresponding crossed product C^*-algebras, and we have an isomorphism between K_i(A) and K_i(B) which maps K_i(C(X \times \T^2)) to K_i(C(X \times \T^2)), then these two dynamical systems are approximately K-conjugate. The proof also indicates that C^*-strongly flip conjugacy implies approximate K-conjugacy in this case.
