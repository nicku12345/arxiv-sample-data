We study the C^*-algebra of Wiener-Hopf operators A_\Omega on a cone \Omega with polyhedral base P. As is known, a sequence of symbol maps may be defined, and their kernels give a filtration by ideals of A_\Omega, with liminary subquotients. One may define K-group valued 'index maps' between the subquotients. These form the E^1 term of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch type spectral sequence induced by the filtration. We show that this E^1 term may, as a complex, be identified with the cellular complex of P, considered as CW complex by taking convex faces as cells. It follows that A_\Omega is KK-contractible, and that A_\Omega/\mathbb K and S are KK-equivalent. Moreover, the isomorphism class of A_\Omega is a complete invariant for the combinatorial type of P.
