We investigate a construction which associates a finite von Neumann algebra M(\Gamma,\mu) to a finite weighted graph (\Gamma,\mu). Pleasantly, but not surprisingly, the von Neumann algebra associated to to a `flower with n petals' is the group von Neumann algebra of the free group on n generators. In general, the algebra M(\Gamma,\mu) is a free product, with amalgamation over a finite-dimensional abelian subalgebra corresponding to the vertex set, of algebras associated to subgraphs `with one edge' (or actually a pair of dual edges). This also yields `natural' examples of (i) a Fock-type model of an operator with a free Poisson distribution; and (ii) \C \oplus \C-valued circular and semi-circular operators.
