The space of positive operator-valued measures on the Borel sets of a compact (or even locally compact) Hausdorff space with values in the algebra of linear operators acting on a d-dimensional Hilbert space is studied from the perspectives of classical and non-classical convexity through a transform \Gamma that associates any positive operator-valued measure with a certain completely positive linear map of the homogeneous C*-algebra C(X)\otimes B(H) into B(H). This association is achieved by using an operator-valued integral in which non-classical random variables (that is, operator-valued functions) are integrated with respect to positive operator-valued measures and which has the feature that the integral of a random quantum effect is itself a quantum effect. A left inverse \Omega for \Gamma yields an integral representation, along the lines of the classical Riesz Representation Theorem for certain linear functionals on C(X), of certain (but not all) unital completely positive linear maps \phi:C(X)\otimes B(H) \rightarrow B(H). The extremal and C*-extremal points of the space of POVMS are determined.
