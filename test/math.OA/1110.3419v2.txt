Dual Lukacs type characterizations of random variables in free probability are studied here. First, we develop a freeness property satisfied by Lukacs type transformations of free-Poisson and free-Binomial non-commutative variables which are free. Second, we give a characterization of non-commutative free-Poisson and free-Binomial variables by properties of first two conditional moments, which mimic Lukacs type assumptions known from classical probability. More precisely, our result is a non-commutative version of the following result known in classical probability: if U, V are independent real random variables, such that E(V(1-U)|UV) and E(V^2(1-U)^2|UV) are non-random then V has a gamma distribution and U has a beta distribution.
