In 2006, Arveson resolved a long-standing problem by showing that for any element x of a separable self-adjoint unital subspace S\subseteq B(H), \|x\|=\sup\|\pi(x)\|, where \pi runs over the boundary representations for S. Here we show that "sup" can be replaced by "max". This implies that the Choquet boundary for a separable operator system is a boundary in the classical sense; a similar result is obtained in terms of pure matrix states when S is not assumed to be separable. For matrix convex sets associated to operator systems in matrix algebras, we apply the above results to improve the Webster-Winkler Krein-Milman theorem.
