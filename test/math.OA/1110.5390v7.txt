A. Gournay defined a notion of l^{p}-dimension for subspaces of the l^{q}-left-regular representation of an amenable discrete group. We give an alternative definition that works for sofic groups and a different notion for groups satisfying the Connes embedding conjecture, and for more general representations on Banach spaces. We extend certain results due to Gournay, as well as discuss l^{p}-Betti numbers of Free groups.
