We study the freely infinitely divisible distributions that appear as the laws of free subordinators. This is the free analog of classically infinitely divisible distributions supported on [0,\infty), called the free regular measures. We prove that the class of free regular measures is closed under the free multiplicative convolution, t-th boolean power for 0\leq t\leq 1, t-th free multiplicative power for t\geq 1 and weak convergence. In addition, we show that a symmetric distribution is freely infinitely divisible if and only if its square can be represented as the free multiplicative convolution of a free Poisson and a free regular measure. This gives two new explicit examples of distributions which are infinitely divisible with respect to both classical and free convolutions: \chi^2(1) and F(1,1). Another consequence is that the free commutator operation preserves free infinite divisibility.
