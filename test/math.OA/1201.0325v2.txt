We show that every Finsler module over a C^*-algebra has a quasi-representation into the Banach space \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H},\mathscr{K}) of all bounded linear operators between some Hilbert spaces \mathscr{H} and \mathscr{K}. We define the notion of completely positive \varphi-morphism and establish a Stinespring type theorem in the framework of Finsler modules over C^*-algebras. We also investigate the nondegeneracy and the irreducibility of quasi-representations.
