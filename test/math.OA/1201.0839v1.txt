This work is a generalization of the results in [Gul] to bi-disc case. As in [Gul], quasi-parabolic composition operators on the Hilbert-Hardy space of the bi-disc are written as a linear combination of Toeplitz operators and Fourier multipliers. The C*-algebra generated by Toeplitz operators and Fourier multipliers on the Hilbert-Hardy space of the bi-disc is written as the tensor product of the similar C*-algebra in one variable with itself. As a result we find a nontrivial set lying inside the essential spectra of quasi-parabolic composition operators.
