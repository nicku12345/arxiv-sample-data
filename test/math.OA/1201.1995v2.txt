We investigate Gaussian actions through the study of their crossed-product von Neumann algebra. The motivational result is Chifan and Ioana's ergodic decomposition theorem for Bernoulli actions (Ergodic subequivalence relations induced by a Bernoulli action, {\it Geometric and Functional Analysis}{\bf 20} (2010), 53-67) that we generalize to Gaussian actions. We also give general structural results that allow us to get a more accurate result at the level of von Neumann algebras. More precisely, for a large class of Gaussian actions \Gamma \curvearrowright X, we show that any subfactor N of L^\infty(X) \rtimes \Gamma containing L^\infty(X) is either hyperfinite or is non-Gamma and prime. At the end of the article, we generalize this result to Bogoliubov actions.
