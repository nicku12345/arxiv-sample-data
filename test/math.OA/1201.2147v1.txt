We prove the existence of commutative C^*-algebras of Toeplitz operators on every weighted Bergman space over the complex projective space \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C}). The symbols that define our algebras are those that depend only on the radial part of the homogeneous coordinates. The algebras presented have an associated pair of Lagrangian foliations with distinguished geometric properties and are closely related to the geometry of \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C}).
