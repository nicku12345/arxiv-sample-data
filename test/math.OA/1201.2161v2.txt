We prove that the quasi-homogenous symbols on the projective space \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C}) yield commutative algebras of Toeplitz operators on all weighted Bergman spaces, thus extending to this compact case known results for the unit ball \mathbb{B}^n. These algebras are Banach but not C^*. We prove the existence of a strong link between such symbols and algebras with the geometry of \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C}). The latter is also proved for the corresponding symbols and algebras on \mathbb{B}^n.
