In previous work we have shown that classical approximation theory provides methods for the systematic construction of inverse-closed smooth subalgebras. Now we extend this work to treat inverse-closed subalgebras of ultradifferentiable elements. In particular, Carleman classes and Dales-Davie algebras are treated. As an application the result of Demko, Smith and Moss and Jaffard on the inverse of a matrix with exponential decay is obtained within the framework of a general theory of smoothness.
