Given an action of a compact quantum group on a unital C*-algebra, one can amplify the action with an adjoint representation of the quantum group on a finite dimensional matrix algebra, and consider the resulting inclusion of fixed point algebras. We show that this inclusion is a finite index inclusion of C*-algebras when the quantum group acts freely. We show that two natural definitions for a quantum group to act freely, namely the Ellwood condition and the saturatedness condition, are equivalent.
