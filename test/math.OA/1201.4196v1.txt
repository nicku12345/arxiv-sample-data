For d = 2, 3, \ldots and p \in [1, \infty), we define a class of representations \rho of the Leavitt algebra L_d on spaces of the form L^p (X, \mu), which we call the spatial representations. We prove that for fixed d and p, the Banach algebra {{\mathcal{O}}_{d}^{p}} obtained as the closure of the image of L_d under the representation \rho is the same for all spatial representations \rho. When p = 2, we recover the usual Cuntz algebra {\mathcal{O}}_{d}. We give a number of equivalent conditions for a representation to be spatial. We show that for distinct p_1 and p_2 in [1, \infty) and arbitrary d_1 and d_2 in \{ 2, 3, \ldots \}, there is no nonzero continuous homomorphism from {\mathcal{O}}_{d_1}^{p_1} to {\mathcal{O}}_{d_2}^{p_2}.
