In 2009, Banica and Speicher began to study the compact quantum subgroups of the free orthogonal quantum group containing the symmetric group S_n. They focused on those whose intertwiner spaces are induced by some partitions. These so-called easy quantum groups have a deep connection to combinatorics. We continue their work on classifying these objects introducing some new examples of easy quantum groups. In particular, we show that the six easy groups O_n, S_n, H_n, B_n, S_n' and B_n' split into seven cases on the side of free easy quantum groups. Also, we give a complete classification in the half-liberated case.
