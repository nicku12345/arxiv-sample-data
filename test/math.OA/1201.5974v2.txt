We study subnormal Toeplitz operators on the vector-valued Hardy space of the unit circle, along with an appropriate reformulation of P.R. Halmos's Problem 5: Which subnormal block Toeplitz operators are either normal or analytic? We extend and prove Abrahamse's Theorem to the case of matrix-valued symbols; that is, we show that every subnormal block Toeplitz operator with bounded type symbol (i.e., a quotient of two analytic functions), whose co-analytic part has a "coprime decomposition," is normal or analytic. We also prove that the coprime decomposition condition is essential. Finally, we examine a well known conjecture, of whether every submormal Toeplitz operator with finite rank self-commutator is normal or analytic.
