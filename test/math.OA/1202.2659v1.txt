This paper contains a quite detailed description of the C*-algebra arising from the transformation groupoid of a rational map of degree at least two on the Riemann sphere. The algebra is decomposed stepwise via extensions of familiar C*-algebras whose nature depend on the structure of the Julia set and the stable regions in the Fatou set, as well as on the behaviour of the critical points.
