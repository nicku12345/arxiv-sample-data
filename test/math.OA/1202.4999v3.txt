Let \cB be the ring of bounded operators in a complex, separable Hilbert space. For p>0 consider the Schatten ideal \cL^p consisting of those operators whose sequence of singular values is p-summable; put \cS=\bigcup_p\cL^p. Let G be a group and \vcyc the family of virtually cyclic subgroups. Guoliang Yu proved that the K-theory assembly map \[ H_*^G(\cE(G,\vcyc),K(\cS))\to K_*(\cS[G]) \] is rationally injective. His proof involves the construction of a certain Chern character tailored to work with coefficients \cS and the use of some results about algebraic K-theory of operator ideals and about controlled topology and coarse geometry. In this paper we give a different proof of Yu's result. Our proof uses the usual Chern character to cyclic homology. Like Yu's, it relies on results on algebraic K-theory of operator ideals, but no controlled topology or coarse geometry techniques are used. We formulate the result in terms of homotopy K-theory. We prove that the rational assembly map \[ H_*^G(\cE(G,\fin),KH(\cL^p))\otimes\Q\to KH_*(\cL^p[G])\otimes\Q \] is injective. We show that the latter map is equivalent to the assembly map considered by Yu, and thus obtain his result as a corollary.
