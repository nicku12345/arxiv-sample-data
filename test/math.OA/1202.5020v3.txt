Let B be a finite dimensional C^\ast-algebra equipped with its canonical trace induced by the regular representation of B on itself. In this paper, we study various properties of the trace-preserving quantum automorphism group \G of B. We prove that the discrete dual quantum group \hG has the property of rapid decay, the reduced von Neumann algebra L^\infty(\G) has the Haagerup property and is solid, and that L^\infty(\G) is (in most cases) a prime type II_1-factor. As applications of these and other results, we deduce the metric approximation property, exactness, simplicity and uniqueness of trace for the reduced C^\ast-algebra C_r(\G), and the existence of a multiplier-bounded approximate identity for the convolution algebra L^1(\G).
