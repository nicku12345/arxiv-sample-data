Convex sets of completely positive maps and positive semidefinite kernels are considered in the most general context of modules over C^*-algebras and a complete charaterization of their extreme points is obtained. As a byproduct, we determine extreme quantum instruments, preparations, channels, and extreme autocorrelation functions. Various applications to quantum information and measurement theories are given. The structure of quantum instruments is analyzed thoroughly.
