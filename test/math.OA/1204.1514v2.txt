Let G be a residually finite group. To any decreasing sequence \mathcal S = (H_n)_n  of finite index subgroups of G is associated a unitary representation \rho_{\mathcal S} of G in the Hilbert space \bigoplus_{n=0}^{+\infty} \ell^2 (G/H_n) . This paper investigates the following question: when does the representation \rho_{\mathcal S}  weakly contain the regular representation \lambda of G?
