Let {\mathcal M} be a von Neumann algebra without central summands of type I_1. Assume that \Phi:{\mathcal M}\rightarrow {\mathcal M} is a surjective map. It is shown that \Phi is strong skew commutativity preserving (that is, satisfies \Phi(A)\Phi(B)-\Phi(B)\Phi(A)^*=AB-BA^* for all A,B\in{\mathcal M}) if and only if there exists some self-adjoint element Z in the center of {\mathcal M} with Z^2=I such that \Phi(A)=ZA for all A\in{\mathcal M}. The strong skew commutativity preserving maps on prime involution rings and prime involution algebras are also characterized.
