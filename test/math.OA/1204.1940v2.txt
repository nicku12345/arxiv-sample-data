Let I \subset \mathbb C[z_1,...,z_d] be a radical homogeneous ideal, and let \mathcal A_I be the norm-closed non-selfadjoint algebra generated by the compressions of the d-shift on Drury-Arveson space H^2_d to the co-invariant subspace H^2_d \ominus I. Then \mathcal A_I is the universal operator algebra for commuting row contractions subject to the relations in I. We ask under which conditions are there topological isomorphisms between two such algebras \mathcal A_I and \mathcal A_J? We provide a positive answer to a conjecture of Davidson, Ramsey and Shalit: \mathcal A_I and \mathcal A_J are topologically isomorphic if and only if there is an invertible linear map A on \mathbb C^d which maps the vanishing locus of J isometrically onto the vanishing locus of I. Most of the proof is devoted to showing that finite algebraic sums of full Fock spaces over subspaces of \mathbb C^d are closed. This allows us to show that the map A induces a completely bounded isomorphism between \mathcal A_I and \mathcal A_J.
