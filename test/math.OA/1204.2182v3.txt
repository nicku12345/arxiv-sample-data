By solving a free analog of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we prove a non-commutative analog of Brenier's monotone transport theorem: if an n-tuple of self-adjoint non-commutative random variables Z_{1},...,Z_{n} satisfies a regularity condition (its conjugate variables \xi_{1},...,\xi_{n} should be analytic in Z_{1},...,Z_{n} and \xi_{j} should be close to Z_{j} in a certain analytic norm), then there exist invertible non-commutative functions F_{j} of an n-tuple of semicircular variables S_{1},...,S_{n}, so that Z_{j}=F_{j}(S_{1},...,S_{n}). Moreover, F_{j} can be chosen to be monotone, in the sense that F_{j}=\mathscr{D}_{j}g and g is a non-commutative function with a positive definite Hessian. In particular, we can deduce that C^{*}(Z_{1},...,Z_{n})\cong C^{*}(S_{1},...,S_{n}) and W^{*}(Z_{1},...,Z_{n})\cong L(\mathbb{F}(n)). Thus our condition is a useful way to recognize when an n-tuple of operators generate a free group factor. We obtain as a consequence that the q-deformed free group factors \Gamma_{q}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) are isomorphic (for sufficiently small q, with bound depending on n) to free group factors. We also partially prove a conjecture of Voiculescu by showing that free Gibbs states which are small perturbations of a semicircle law generate free group factors. Lastly, we show that entrywise monotone transport maps for certain Gibbs measure on matrices are well-approximated by the matricial transport maps given by free monotone transport.
