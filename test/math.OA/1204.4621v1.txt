A closed subspace of a Banach space \cX is almost-invariant for a collection \cS of bounded linear operators on \cX if for each T \in \cS there exists a finite-dimensional subspace \cF_T of \cX such that T \cY \subseteq \cY + \cF_T. In this paper, we study the existence of almost-invariant subspaces of infinite dimension and codimension for various classes of Banach and Hilbert space operators. We also examine the structure of operators which admit a maximal commuting family of almost-invariant subspaces. In particular, we prove that if T is an operator on a separable Hilbert space and if TP-PT has finite rank for all projections P in a given maximal abelian self-adjoint algebra \fM then T=M+F where M\in\fM and F is of finite rank.
