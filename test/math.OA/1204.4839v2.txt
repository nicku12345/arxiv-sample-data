In 2007 Phillips and Weaver showed that, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, there exists an outer automorphism of the Calkin algebra. (The Calkin algebra is the algebra of bounded operators on a separable complex Hilbert space, modulo the compact operators.) In this paper we establish that the analogous conclusion holds for a broad family of quotient algebras. Specifically, we will show that assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, if A is a separable algebra which is either simple or stable, then the corona of A has nontrivial automorphisms. We also discuss a connection with cohomology theory, namely, that our proof can be viewed as a computation of the cardinality of a particular derived inverse limit.
