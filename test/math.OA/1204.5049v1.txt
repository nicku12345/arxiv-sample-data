Let A,B\in \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H}) be such that 0<b_{1}I \leq A \leq a_{1}I and 0<b_{2}I \leq B \leq a_{2}I for some scalars 0<b_{i}< a_{i},\;\; i=1,2 and \Phi:\mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H})\rightarrow\mathbb{B}(\mathscr{K}) be a positive linear map. We show that for any operator mean \sigma with the representing function f, the double inequality  \omega^{1-\alpha}(\Phi(A)#_{\alpha}\Phi(B))\le (\omega\Phi(A))\nabla_{\alpha}\Phi(B)\leq \frac{\alpha}{\mu}\Phi(A\sigma B)  holds, where \mu=\frac{a_{1}b_{1}(f(b_{2}a_{1}^{-1})-f(a_{2}b_{1}^{-1}))}{b_{1}b_{2}-a_{1}a_{2}},  \nu=\frac{a_{1}a_{2}f(b_{2}a_{1}^{-1})-b_{1}b_{2}f(a_{2}b_{1}^{-1})}{a_{1}a_{2}-b_{1}b_{2}},  \omega=\frac{\alpha \nu}{(1-\alpha)\mu} and #_{\alpha} (\nabla_{\alpha}, resp.) is the weighted geometric (arithmetic, resp.) mean for \alpha \in (0,1).   As applications, we present several generalized operator inequalities including Diaz--Metcalf and reverse Ando type inequalities. We also give some related inequalities involving Hadamard product and operator means.
