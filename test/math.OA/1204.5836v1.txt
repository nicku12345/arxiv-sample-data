We completely classify the extreme tracial states onthe cores of the C*-algebras associated with self-similar maps on compact metric spaces. We present a complete list of them. The extreme tracial states are the union of the discrete type tracial states given by measures supported on the finite orbits of the branch points and a continuous type tracial state given by the Hutchinson measure on the original self-similar set.
