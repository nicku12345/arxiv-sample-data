By a bounded backward sequence of the operator T we mean a bounded sequence \{x_n\} satisfying Tx_{n+1}=x_n. In \cite{Pa} we have characterized contractions with strongly stable nonunitary part in terms of bounded backward sequences. The main purpose of this work is to extend that result to power-bounded operators. Aditionally, we show that a power-bounded operator is strongly stable (C_{0 \cdot} ) if and only if its adjoint does not have any nonzero bounded backward sequence. Similarly, a power-bounded operator is non-vanishing (C_{1 \cdot} ) if and only if its adjoint has a lot of bounded backward sequences.
