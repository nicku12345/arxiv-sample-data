We study a coisometry that intertwines Popescu's presentations of minimal isometric dilations of a given operator tuple and of a coisometric lifting of the tuple. Using this we develop an outgoing Cuntz scattering system which gives rise to an input-output formalism. A transfer function is introduced for the system. We also compare the transfer function and the characteristic function for the associated lifting.
