We call a bounded linear operator acting between Banach spaces weakly compactly generated (\mathsf{WCG} for short) if its range is contained in a weakly compactly generated subspace of its codomain. This notion simultaneously generalises being weakly compact and having separable range. In a comprehensive study of the class of \mathsf{WCG} operators, we prove that it forms a closed surjective operator ideal and investigate its relations to other classical operator ideals. By considering the pth long James space \mathcal{J}_p(\omega_1), we show how properties of the ideal of \mathsf{WCG} operators (such as being the unique maximal ideal) may be used to derive results outside ideal theory. For instance, we identify the K_0-group of \mathscr{B}(\mathcal{J}_p(\omega_1)) as the additive group of integers.
