Let \varphi be a normal state on the algebra B(H) of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space H, f a strictly positive, continuous function on (0, \infty), and let g be a function on (0, \infty) defined by g(t) = \frac{t}{f(t)}. We will give characterizations of matrix and operator monotonicity by the following generalized Powers-St\ormer inequality:    \varphi(A + B) - \varphi(|A - B|) \leq 2\varphi(f(A)^1/2g(B)f(A)^1/2),  whenever A, B are positive invertible operators in B(H).
