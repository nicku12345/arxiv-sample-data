For a locally compact group G, the first-named author considered the closed subspace a_0(G) which is generated by the pure positive definite functions. In many cases a_0(G) is itself an algebra. We illustrate using Heisenburg groups and the 2\times 2 real special linear group, that this is not the case in general. We examine the structures of the algebras thereby created and examine properties related to amenability.
