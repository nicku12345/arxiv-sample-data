We show that if the principal graph of a subfactor planar algebra of modulus \delta>2 is stable for two depths, then it must end in A_{finite} tails. This result is analogous to Popa's theorem on principal graph stability. We use these theorems to show that an (n-1) supertransitive subfactor planar algebra has jellyfish generators at depth n if and only if its principal graph is a spoke graph.
