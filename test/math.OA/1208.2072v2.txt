We consider the minimal boundedly-translation-invariant Segal algebra S_0^p(G) in the Fig\`{a}-Talamanca--Herz algebra A_p(G) of a locally compact group G. In the case that p=2 and G is abelian this is the classical Segal algebra of Feichtinger. Hence we call this the Feichtinger--Fig\`{a}-Talamanca--Herz Segal algebra of G. Remarkably, this space is also a Segal algebra in L^1(G) and is, in fact, the minimal such algebra which is closed under pointwise multiplication by \apg. Even for p=2, this result is new for non-abelian G. We place a p-operator space structure on S_0^p(G), and demonstrate the naturality of this by showing that it satisfies all natural functiorial properties: projective tensor products, restriction to subgroups and averaging over normal subgroups. However, due to complications arising within the theory of p-operator spaces, we are forced to work with weakly completely bounded maps in many of our results.
