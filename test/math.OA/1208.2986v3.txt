As is well known, the equivalence between amenability of a locally compact group G and injectivity of its von Neumann algebra \mathcal{L}(G) does not hold in general beyond inner amenable groups. In this paper, we show that the equivalence persists for all locally compact groups if \mathcal{L}(G) is considered as a \mathcal{T}(L_2(G))-module with respect to a natural action. In fact, we prove an appropriate version of this result for every locally compact quantum group.
