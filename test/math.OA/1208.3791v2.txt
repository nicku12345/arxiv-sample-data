Let G be a finitely generated group with polynomial growth, and let \om be a weight, i.e. a sub-multiplicative function on G with positive values. We study when the weighted group algebra \ell^1(G,\om) is isomorphic to an operator algebra. We show that \ell^1(G,\om) is isomorphic to an operator algebra if \om is a polynomial weight with large enough degree or an exponential weight of order 0<\alpha<1. We will demonstrate the order of growth of G plays an important role in this question. Moreover, the algebraic centre of \ell^1(G,\om) is isomorphic to a Q-algebra and hence satisfies a multi-variable von Neumann inequality. We also present a more detailed study of our results when G is the d-dimensional integers \Z^d and 3-dimensional discrete Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}_3(\Z). The case of the free group with two generators will be considered as a counter example of groups with exponential growth.
