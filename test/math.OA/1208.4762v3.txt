We address the following two questions regarding the maximal left ideals of the Banach algebra \mathscr{B}(E) of bounded operators acting on an infinite-dimensional Banach pace E:   (Q1) Does \mathscr{B}(E) always contain a maximal left ideal which is not finitely generated? (Q2) Is every finitely-generated, maximal left ideal of \mathscr{B}(E) necessarily of the form \{T\in\mathscr{B}(E): Tx = 0\} (*) for some non-zero x\in E?   Since the two-sided ideal \mathscr{F}(E) of finite-rank operators is not contained in any of the maximal left ideals given by (*), a positive answer to the second question would imply a positive answer to the first. Our main results are: (i) Question (Q1) has a positive answer for most (possibly all) infinite-dimensional Banach spaces; (ii) Question (Q2) has a positive answer if and only if no finitely-generated, maximal left ideal of \mathscr{B}(E) contains \mathscr{F}(E); (iii) the answer to Question (Q2) is positive for many, but not all, Banach spaces.
