We will show that if \sM is a factor, then for any pair \f, \p\in\sMdsup of normal positive linear functionals on \sM, the inequality:  \lrnorm{\f}\leq \lrnorm{\p}  is equivalent to the fact that there exist a countable family \lrbrace{\ffdi: i\in I}\subset \sMdsup in \sMdsup and a family \lrbrace{\udi: i\in I}\i\sM of partial isometries in \cM such that  \f=\sumd{i\in I} \ffdi,\quad \sumd{i\in I} \udi{\ffdi}\udius\leq \p, \quad \text{and} \quad \udius\udi=s\lr{\ffdi}, i\in I,  where s(\omega), \omega\in\sMdsup, means the support projection of \omega. Furthermore, if \lrnorm{\f}=\lrnorm{\p}, then the equality replaces the inequality in the second statement. In the case that \sM is not of type \threeonec the family of partial isometries can be replaced by a family of unitaries in \cMp One cannot expect to have this result in the usual integration thoery. To have a similar result, one needs to bring in some kind of non-commutativity. Let \lrbrace{X, \mu} be a \sig-finite semifinite measure space and G be an ergodic group of automorphisms of \linflr{X, \mu}, then for a pair f and g of \mu-integrable positive functions on X, the inequality:  \int_X f(x)\txd \mu(x)\leq \int_X g(x)\txd \mu(x)  is equivalent to the existence of a countable families \lrbrace{\fdi: i\in I}\subset L^1(X, \mu) of positive integrable functions and \lrbrace{\gdi: i\in I} in G such that  f=\sumd{i\in I} \fdi\quad\text{and}\quad \sumd{i\in I} \gdi\lr{\fdi}\leq g,  where the summation and inequality are all taken in the oredered Banach space L^1(X, \mu) and the action of G on \lonelr{X, \mu} is defined through the duality between \linflr{X, \mu} and \lonelr{X, \mu}, i.e.,   \lr{\g(f)}(x)&=f\lr{\g\inv x}\frac{\txd\mu\scirc \g\inv}{\txd\mu}(x), \quad f\in\lonelr{X, \mu}.
