We consider majorization problems in the non-commutative setting. More specifically, suppose E and F are ordered normed spaces (not necessarily lattices), and 0 \leq T \leq S :E \to F. If S belongs to a certain ideal (for instance, the ideal of compact or Dunford-Pettis operators), does it follow that T belongs to that ideal as well? We concentrate on the case when E and F are C^*-algebras, preduals of von Neumann algebras, or non-commutative function spaces. In particular, we show that, for C^*-algebras \A and {\mathcal{B}}, the following are equivalent: (1) at least one of the two conditions holds: (i) \A is scattered, (ii) {\mathcal{B}} is compact; (2) if 0 \leq T \leq S : \A \to {\mathcal{B}}, and S is compact, then T is compact.
