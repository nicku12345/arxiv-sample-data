We formulate a general framework for the study of operator systems arising from discrete groups. We study in detail the operator system of the free group on n generators, as well as the operator systems of the free products of finitely many copies of the two-element group \mathbb Z_2. We examine various tensor products of group operator systems, including the minimal, the maximal, and the commuting tensor products. We introduce a new tensor product in the category of operator systems and formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for its equality to the commuting tensor product in the case of group operator systems. We express various sets of quantum correlations studied in the theoretical physics literature in terms of different tensor products of operator systems of discrete groups. We thus recover earlier results of Tsirelson and formulate a new approach for the study of quantum correlation boxes.
