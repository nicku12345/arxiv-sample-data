Let M be a von Neumann algebra and let M_\star be its (unique) predual. We study when for every \varphi\in M_\star there exists \psi\in M_\star solving the equation \|\varphi \pm \psi\|=\|\varphi\|=\|\psi\|. This is the case when M does not contain type I nor type III_1 factors as direct summands and it is false at least for the unique hyperfinite type III_1 factor. We also characterize this property in terms of the existence of centrally symmetric curves in the unit sphere of M_\star of length 4. An approximate result valid for all diffuse von Neumann algebras allows to show that the equation has solution for every element in the ultraproduct of preduals of diffuse von Neumann algebras and, in particular, the dual von Neumann algebra of such ultraproduct is diffuse. This shows that the Daugavet property and the uniform Daugavet property are equivalent for preduals of von Neumann algebras.
