We give an explicit description, via analytic subordination, of free multiplicative convolution of operator-valued distributions. In particular, the subordination function is obtained from an iteration process. This algorithm is easily numerically implementable. We present two concrete applications of our method: the product of two free operator-valued semicircular elements and the calculation of the distribution of dcd+d^2cd^2 for scalar-valued c and d, which are free. Comparision between the solution obtained by our methods and simulations of random matrices shows excellent agreement.
