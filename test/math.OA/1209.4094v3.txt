We study the problem of constructing a globalization for partial actions on *-algebras, C*-algebras and Hilbert modules. For the first ones we give a necessary condition for the existence of a globalization and we prove this conditions is necessary and sufficient for C*-algebras. Using the linking algebra of a Hilbert module we translate this condition to the realm of partial action on Hilbert modules.
