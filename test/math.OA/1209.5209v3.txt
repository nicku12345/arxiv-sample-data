In this paper, we investigate several structural properties for crossed product {\rm II_1} factors M arising from free Bogoljubov actions associated with orthogonal representations \pi : G \to \mathcal O(H_\mathbf R) of arbitrary countable discrete groups. Under fairly general assumptions on the orthogonal representation \pi : G \to \mathcal O(H_{\mathbf R}), we show that M does not have property Gamma of Murray and von Neumann. Then we show that any regular amenable subalgebra A \subset M can be embedded into L(G) inside M. Finally, when G is assumed to be amenable, we locate precisely any possible amenable or Gamma extension of L(G) inside M.
