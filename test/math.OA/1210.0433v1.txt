A geometric characterization is given for invertible quantum measurement maps. Denote by {\mathcal S}(H) the convex set of all states (i.e., trace-1 positive operators) on Hilbert space H with dimH\leq \infty, and [\rho_1, \rho_2] the line segment joining two elements \rho_1, \rho_2 in {\mathcal S}(H). It is shown that a bijective map \phi:{\mathcal S}(H) \rightarrow {\mathcal S}(H) satisfies \phi([\rho_1, \rho_2]) \subseteq [\phi(\rho_1),\phi(\rho_2)] for any \rho_1, \rho_2 \in {\mathcal S} if and only if \phi has one of the following forms \rho \mapsto \frac{M\rho M^*}{{\rm tr}(M\rho M^*)}\quad \hbox{or} \quad \rho \mapsto \frac{M\rho^T M^*}{{\rm tr}(M\rho^T M^*)}, where M is an invertible bounded linear operator and \rho^T is the transpose of \rho with respect to an arbitrarily fixed orthonormal basis.
