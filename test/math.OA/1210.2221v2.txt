We discuss various notions generalizing the concept of a homogeneous space to the setting of locally compact quantum groups. On the von Neumann algebra level we find an interesting duality for such objects. A definition of a quantum homogeneous space is proposed along the lines of the pioneering work of Vaes on induction and imprimitivity for locally compact quantum groups. The concept of an embeddable quantum homogeneous space is selected and discussed in detail as it seems to be the natural candidate for the quantum analog of classical homogeneous spaces. Among various examples we single out the quantum analog of the quotient of the Cartesian product of a quantum group with itself by the diagonal subgroup, analogs of quotients by compact subgroups as well as quantum analogs of trivial principal bundles.
