We show how the proof of the Grothendieck Theorem for jointly completely bounded bilinear forms on C*-algebras by Haagerup and Musat can be modified in such a way that the method of proof is essentially C*-algebraic. To this purpose, we use Cuntz algebras rather than type III factors. Furthermore, we show that the best constant in Blecher's inequality is strictly greater than one.
