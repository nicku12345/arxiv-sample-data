We define a new class of singular positive traces on the ideal \mathcal M_{1,\infty} of B(H) generated by exponentiation invariant generalized limits. We prove that this new class is strictly contained in the class of all Dixmier traces. We also prove a Lidskii-type formula for this class of traces.
