Let (P_1,...,P_n) be an n--tuple of projections in a unital C^*--algebra \aa. We say \pn is complete in \aa if \aa is the linear direct sum of the closed subspaces P_1\aa,...,P_n\aa. In this paper, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for the completeness of \pn and discuss the perturbation problem and topology of the set of all complete n--tuple of projections in \aa. Some interesting and significant results are obtained in this paper.
