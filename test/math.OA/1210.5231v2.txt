We prove two versions of Bochner's theorem for locally compact quantum groups. First, every completely positive definite "function" on a locally compact quantum group \G arises as a transform of a positive functional on the universal C*-algebra C_0^u(\dual\G) of the dual quantum group. Second, when \G is coamenable, complete positive definiteness may be replaced with the weaker notion of positive definiteness, which models the classical notion. A counterexample is given to show that the latter result is not true in general. To prove these results, we show two auxiliary results of independent interest: products are linearly dense in \lone_\sharp(\G), and when \G is coamenable, the Banach *-algebra \lone_\sharp(\G) has a contractive bounded approximate identity.
