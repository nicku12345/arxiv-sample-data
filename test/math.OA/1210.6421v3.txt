We give another definition of orbital free entropy introduced by Hiai, Miyamoto and us, which does not need the hyperfiniteness assumption for each given random multi-variable. The present definition is somehow related to one of its several recent `generalizations' due to Biane and Dabrowski, but completely agrees with the original definition and much closer to the original approach.
