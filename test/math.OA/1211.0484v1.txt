Motivated by our subfactor generalization of Wall's conjecture, in this paper we determine all intermediate subfactors for conformal subnets corresponding to four infinite series of conformal inclusions, and as a consequence we verify that these series of subfactors verify our conjecture. Our results can be stated in the framework of Vertex Operator Algebras. We also verify our conjecture for Jones-Wassermann subfactors from representations of Loop groups extending our earlier results.
