We prove perturbation results for traces on normed ideals in semifinite von Neumann algebra factors. This includes the case of Dixmier traces. In particular, we establish existence of spectral shift measures with initial operators being dissipative or bounded, and show that these measures can have singular components in the case of Dixmier traces. We also establish a linearization formula for a Dixmier trace applied to perturbed operator functions, a result that does not typically hold for normal traces.
