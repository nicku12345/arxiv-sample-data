This is a complement to our previous paper on the arxiv on quantum expanders and geometry of operator spaces. We show that there is a non-exact C^*-algebra that is 1-subexponential, and we give several other complements to the results of that paper. Our example can be described very simply using random matrices: Let {X_j^{(m)}\mid j=1,2,...} be an i.i.d. sequence of random m\times m-matrices distributed according to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). For each j let u_j(\omega) be the block direct sum defined by u_j(\omega)= \oplus_{m\ge 1} X_j^{(m)}(\omega)\in \oplus_{m\ge 1} M_m. Then for almost every \omega the C^*-algebra generated by {u_j(\omega) \mid j=1,2,...} is 1-subexponential but is not exact. The GUE is a matrix model for the semi-circular distribution. We can also use instead the analogous circular model.
