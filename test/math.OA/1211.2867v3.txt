By a result of Johnson, the Banach space F=(\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_1^n)_{\ell_\infty} contains a complemented copy of \ell_1. We identify F with a complemented subspace of the space of (bounded, linear) operators on the reflexive space (\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_1^n)_{\ell_p} (p\in (1,\infty)), thus giving a negative answer to the problem posed in the monograph of Diestel and Uhl which asks whether the space of operators on a reflexive Banach space is Grothendieck.
