We give sufficient conditions on an operator space E and on a semigroup of operators on a von Neumann algebra M to obtain a bounded analytic or a R-analytic semigroup (T_t \otimes Id_E)_{t \geq 0} on the vector valued noncommutative L^p-space L^p(M,E). Moreover, we give applications to the H^\infty(\Sigma_\theta) functional calculus of the generators of these semigroups, generalizing some earlier work of M. Junge, C. Le Merdy and Q. Xu.
