We prove a Kadec-Pelczy\'nski dichotomy-type theorem for bounded sequences in the predual of a JBW*-algebra, showing that for each bounded sequence (\phi_n) in the predual of a JBW^*-algebra M, there exist a subsequence (\phi_{\tau(n)}), and a sequence of mutually orthogonal projections (p_n) in M such that: [(a)] the set {\phi_{\tau(n)} - \phi_{\tau(n)} P_{2} (p_n): n\in \mathbb{N}} is relatively weakly compact, \phi_{\tau(n)}=\xi_n+\psi_n, with \xi_n := \phi_{\tau(n)} - \phi_{\tau(n)} P_{2} (p_n), and \psi_n := \phi_{\tau(n)} P_{2} (p_n), {\rm(}\xi_n Q(p_n)= 0 and \psi_n Q(p_n)^2 = \psi_n{\rm)}, for every n.
