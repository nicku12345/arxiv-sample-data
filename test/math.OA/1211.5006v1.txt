For an r-discrete Hausdorff groupoid {\cal G} and an inverse semigroup S of slices of {\cal G} there is an isomorphism between {\cal G}-equivariant KK-theory and compatible S-equivariant KK-theory. We use it to define descent homomorphisms for S, and indicate a Baum--Connes map for inverse semigroups. Also findings by Khoshkam and Skandalis for crossed products by inverse semigroups are reflected in KK-theory.
