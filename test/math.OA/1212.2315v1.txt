In this note, we consider the smallest submaximal space structure {\mu}(X) on a Banach space X. We derive a characterization of {\mu}(X) up to complete isometric isomorphism in terms of a universal property. Also, we show that an injective Banach space has a unique submaximal space structure and we explore some duality relations of {\mu}-spaces.   Key Words: operator spaces, maximal operator spaces, submaximal spaces, {\mu}- spaces.
