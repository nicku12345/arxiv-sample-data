We apply the Tannaka-Krein duality theory for quantum homogeneous spaces, developed in the first part of this series of papers, to the case of the quantum SU(2) groups. We obtain a classification of their quantum homogeneous spaces in terms of weighted oriented graphs. The equivariant maps between these quantum homogeneous spaces can be characterized by certain quadratic equations associated with the braiding on the representations of SUq(2). We show that, for |q| close to 1, all quantum homogeneous spaces are realized by coideals.
