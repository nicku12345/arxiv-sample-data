We show that for C^{\ast}-algebras A and B, there is a natural open bijection from \mathrm{Glimm}(A) \times \mathrm{Glimm} (B) to \mathrm{Glimm}(A \otimes_{\alpha} B) (where A \otimes_{\alpha} B denotes the minimal C^{\ast}-tensor product), and identify a large class of C^{\ast}-algebras A for which the map is continuous for arbitrary B. As a consequence we determine the structure space of the centre of the multiplier algebra ZM(A \otimes_{\alpha} B) in terms of \mathrm{Glimm}(A) and \mathrm{Glimm} (B), and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the inclusion ZM(A) \otimes ZM(B) \subseteq ZM(A \otimes_{\alpha} B) to be surjective. Further we show that when the Glimm spaces are considered as sets of ideals, the map (G,H) \mapsto G \otimes_{\alpha} B + A \otimes_{\alpha} H implements the above bijection, extending a result of Kaniuth from a 1996 paper by eliminating the assumption of property (F).
