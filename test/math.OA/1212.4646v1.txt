This text takes, with more details and simplifying a proof in section 3, the parts of [Laf08] and [Laf09] treating p-adic groups. We prove that SL_{3} over a non archimedian local field F has strong Banach property (T). The applications are as follows: any connected almost F-simple algebraic group G over F whose Lie algebra contains sl_3(F) has strong Banach property (T), the family of expanders constructed from a lattice of G(F) do not embed uniformly in any Banach space of type >1, and any isometric affine action of G(F) on a Banach space of type >1 admits a fix point.
