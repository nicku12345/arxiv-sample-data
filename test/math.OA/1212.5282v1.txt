For \delta an m-tuple of analytic functions, we define an algebra \hidg, contained in the bounded analytic functions on the analytic polyhedron  {|\delta^l(z)| < 1, \ 1 \leq l \leq m}, and prove a representation formula for it. We give conditions whereby every function that is analytic on a neighborhood of  {|\delta^l(z)| \leq 1, \ 1 \leq l \leq m} is actually in \hidg. We use this to give a proof of the Oka extension theorem with bounds. We define an \hidg functional calculus for operators.
