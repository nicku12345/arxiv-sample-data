We show that all 2\otimes 4 states with strong positive partial transposes (SPPT) are separable. We also construct a family of 2\otimes 5 entangled SPPT states, so the conjecture on the separability of SPPT states are completely settled. In addition, we clarify the relation between the set of all 2\otimes d separable states and the set of all 2\otimes d SPPT states for the case of d=3,4.
