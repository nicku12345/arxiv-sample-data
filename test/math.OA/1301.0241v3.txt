In this paper we give and prove a criterion for the normality of unbounded closed operators, which is a sort of a maximality result which will be called "double maximality". As applications, we show, under some assumptions, that the sum of two symmetric operators is essentially self-adjoint; and that the sum of two unbounded normal operators is essentially normal. Some other important results are also established.
