Let A be a unital separable simple {\cal Z}-stable C*-algebra which has rational tracial rank at most one and let u\in U_0(A), the connected component of the unitary group of A. We show that, for any \epsilon>0, there exists a self-adjoint element h\in A such that  |u-\exp(ih)|<\epsilon.  The lower bound of |h| could be as large as one wants. If u\in CU(A), the closure of the commutator subgroup of the unitary group, we prove that there exists a self-adjoint element h\in A such that  |u-\exp(ih)| <\epsilon and |h|\le 2\pi.  Examples are given that the bound 2\pi for |h| is the optimal in general. For the Jiang-Su algebra {\cal Z}, we show that, if u\in U_0({\cal Z}) and \epsilon>0, there exists a real number -\pi<t\le \pi and a self-adjoint element h\in {\cal Z} with |h|\le 2\pi such that  |e^{it}u-\exp(ih)|<\epsilon.
