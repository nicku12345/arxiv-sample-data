In [Laf08], [Laf09], Vincent Lafforgue proved strong Banach property (T) for SL_3 over a non archimedean local field F. In this paper, we extend his results to Sp_4 and therefore to any connected almost F-simple algebraic group with F-split rank \geq 2. As applications, the family of expanders constructed from any lattice of such a group do not admit a uniform embedding into any Banach space of type >1, and any isometric affine action of such a group, or its cocompact lattice, on a Banach space of type >1 has a fixed point.
