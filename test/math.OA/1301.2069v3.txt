We prove that the L^1-algebra of any non-Kac type compact quantum group does not satisfy operator biflatness. Since operator amenability implies operator biflatness, this result shows that any co-amenable, non-Kac type compact quantum group gives a counter example to the conjecture that L^1(\Gb) is operator amenable if and only if \Gb is amenable and co-amenable for any locally compact quantum group \Gb. The result also implies that the L^1-algebra of a locally compact quantum group is operator biprojective if and only if \Gb is compact and of Kac type.
