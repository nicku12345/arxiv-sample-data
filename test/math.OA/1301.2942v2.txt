We compute the two-cocycles (or multipliers) of the free nilpotent groups of class 2 and rank n and give conditions for simplicity of the corresponding twisted group C^*-algebras. These groups are representation groups for \mathbb{Z}^n and can be considered as a family of generalized Heisenberg groups with higher-dimensional center. Their group C^*-algebras are in a natural way isomorphic to continuous fields over \mathbb{T}^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)} with the noncommutative n-tori as fibers. In this way, the twisted group C^*-algebras associated with the free nilpotent groups of class 2 and rank n may be thought of as "second order" noncommutative n-tori.
