We introduce the non-commutative f-divergence functional \Theta(\widetilde{A},\widetilde{B}):=\int_TB_t^{\frac{1}{2}}f\left(B_t^{-\frac{1}{2}} A_tB_t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)B_t^{\frac{1}{2}}d\mu(t) for an operator convex function f, where \widetilde{A}=(A_t)_{t\in T} and \widetilde{B}=(B_t)_{t\in T} are continuous fields of Hilbert space operators and study its properties. We establish some relations between the perspective of an operator convex function f and the non-commutative f-divergence functional. In particular, an operator extension of Csisz\'{a}r's result regarding f-divergence functional is presented. As some applications, we establish a refinement of the Choi--Davis--Jensen operator inequality, obtain some unitarily invariant norm inequalities and give some results related to the Kullback--Leibler distance.
