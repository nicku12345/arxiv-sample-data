Let {\mathcal N} and {\mathcal M} be nests on Banach spaces X and Y over the (real or complex) field \mathbb F and let \mbox{\rm Alg}{\mathcal N} and \mbox{\rm Alg}{\mathcal M} be the associated nest algebras, respectively. It is shown that a map \Phi:{\rm Alg}{\mathcal N}\rightarrow{\rm Alg}{\mathcal M} is a Lie ring isomorphism (i.e., \Phi is additive, Lie multiplicative and bijective) if and only if \Phi has the form \Phi(A) = TAT^{-1} + h(A)I for all A\in \mbox{\rm Alg}{\mathcal N} or \Phi(A)=-TA^*T^{-1}+h(A)I for all A\in \mbox{\rm Alg}{\mathcal N}, where h is an additive functional vanishing on all commutators and T is an invertible bounded linear or conjugate linear operator when \dim X=\infty; T is a bijective \tau-linear transformation for some field automorphism \tau of \mathbb F when \dim X<\infty.
