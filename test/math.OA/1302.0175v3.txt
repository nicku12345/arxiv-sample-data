In this paper, we show that a D-type map \Phi_D:M_n\rightarrow M_n with D=(n-2)I_n+P_{\pi_1}+P_{\pi_2} induced by a pair   \{\pi_1,\pi_2\} of permutations of (1,2,..., n) is positive if \{\pi_1,\pi_2\} has property (C). The property (C) is characterized for \{\pi_1,\pi_2\}, and an easy criterion is given for the case that \pi_1=\pi^p and \pi_2=\pi^q, where \pi is the permutation defined by \pi(i)=i+1 mod n and 1\leq p<q\leq n.
