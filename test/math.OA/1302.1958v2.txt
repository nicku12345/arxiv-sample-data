The variance of a bounded linear operator a on a Hilbert space H at a unit vector h is defined by D_h(a)=\|ah\|^2-|<ah,h>|^2. We show that two operators a and b have the same variance at all vectors h\in H if and only if there exist scalars \sigma,\lambda with |\sigma|=1 such that b=\sigma a+\lambda1 or a is normal and b=\sigma a^*+\lambda1. Further, if a is normal, then the inequality D_h(b)\leq\kappa D_h(a) holds for some constant \kappa and all unit vectors h if and only if b=f(a) for a Lipschitz function f on the spectrum of a. Variants of these results for C^*-algebras are also proved.   We also study the related, but more restrictive inequalities \|bx-xb\|\leq \|ax-xa\| supposed to hold for all x\in B(H) or for all x\in B(H^n) and all positive integers n. We consider the connection between such inequalities and the range inclusion d_b(B(H))\subseteq d_a(B(H)), where d_a and d_b are the derivations on B(H) induced by a and b. If a is subnormal, we study these conditions in particular in the case when b is of the form b=f(a) for a function f.
