Freyd's Generating Hypothesis is an important problem in topology with deep structural consequences for finite stable homotopy. Due to its complexity some recent work has examined analogous questions in various other triangulated categories. In this short note we analyze the question in noncommutative stable homotopy, which is a canonical generalization of finite stable homotopy. Along the way we also discuss Spanier--Whitehead duality in this extended setup.
