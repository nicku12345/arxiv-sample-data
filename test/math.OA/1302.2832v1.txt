We consider a unitary cocycle or Sch\"urmann triple on the non-commutative unitary group fixed by a complex matrix which induces an additive free white noise or an additive free L\'evy process on the tensor algebra over the full Fock space. A L\'evy process on a Voiculescu dual semi-group is given by a generator or Sch\"urmann triple. We will show how a free L\'evy process on the non-commutative unitary group fixed by a complex matrix can be obtained by infinitesimally convolving the additive free white noise.
