We prove that symmetric Meixner distributions, whose probability densities are proportional to |\Gamma(t+ix)|^2, are freely infinitely divisible for 0<t\leq\frac{1}{2}. The case t=\frac{1}{2} corresponds to the law of L\'evy's stochastic area whose probability density is \frac{1}{\cosh(\pi x)}. A logistic distribution, whose probability density is proportional to \frac{1}{\cosh^2(\pi x)}, is freely infinitely divisible too.
