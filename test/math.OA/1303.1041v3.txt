We develop a several variables analog of the Jordan blocks of the Hardy space H^2(\mathbb{D}). In this consideration, we obtain a complete characterization of the doubly commuting quotient modules of the Hardy module H^2(\mathbb{D}^n). We prove that a quotient module \clq of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) (n \geq 2) is doubly commuting if and only if \[\clq = \clq_{\Theta_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \clq_{\Theta_n},\]where each \clq_{\Theta_i} is either a one variable Jordan block H^2(\mathbb{D})/\Theta_i H^2(\mathbb{D}) for some inner function \Theta_i or the Hardy module H^2(\mathbb{D}) on the unit disk for all i = 1, \ldots, n. We say that a submodule \cls of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) is a co-doubly commuting if the quotient module H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)/\cls is doubly commuting. We obtain a Beurling like theorem for the class of co-doubly commuting submodules of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n). We prove that a submodule \cls of H^2(\mathbb{D}^n) is co-doubly commuting if and only if \[\cls = \mathop{\sum}_{i=1}^m \Theta_i H^2(\mathbb{D}^n),\]for some integer m \leq n and one variable inner functions \{\Theta_i\}_{i=1}^m.
