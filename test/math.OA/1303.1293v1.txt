Weighted shift operators B in space L^2(X,\mu) that are induced by Morse-Smale type of mappings are considered. A description of the properties of B-\lambda I for \lambda belonging to spectrum \Sigma(B) is given. In particular, there is the necessary and sufficient condition that B-\lambda I be a one-sided invertible and the condition that set Im(B-\lambda I) be non-closed. These conditions use a new notation: an oriented decomposition of oriented graph G(X,\alpha) generated by mapping \alpha
