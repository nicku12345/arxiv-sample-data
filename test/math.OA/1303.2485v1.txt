We study several classes of indecomposable representations of quivers on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and their relation. Many examples are constructed using strongly irreducible operators. Some problems in operator theory are rephrased in terms of representations of quivers. We shall show two kinds of constructions of quite non-trivial indecomposable Hilbert representations of the Kronecker quiver such that their endomorphism rings are trivial, which are called transitive. One is a perturbation of a weighted shift operator by a rank-one operator. The other one is a modification of an unbounded operator used by Harrison,Radjavi and Rosenthal to provide a transitive lattice.
