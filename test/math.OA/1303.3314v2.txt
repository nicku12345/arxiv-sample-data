By working with all collection of all the Sarason Hilbert Hardy spaces for the annulus algebra an improvement to the results of Aryana and Clancey on eigenvalues of self adjoint Toeplitz operators on an annulus is obtained. The ideas are applied to Toeplitz operators on the Neil algebra. These examples may provide a template for a general theory of Toeplitz operators with respect to an algebra.
