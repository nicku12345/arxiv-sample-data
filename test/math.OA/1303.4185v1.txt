For \varphi a normalized positive definite function on a locally compact abelian group G, we consider on the one hand the unitary representation \pi_\varphi associated to \varphi by the GNS construction, on the other hand the probability measure \mu_\varphi on the Pontryagin dual \hat{G} provided by Bochner's theorem. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of 1-cohomology H^1(G,\pi_\varphi) and reduced 1-cohomology \bar{H}^1(G,\pi_\varphi). For example, \bar{H}^1(G,\pi_\varphi)=0 if and only if either Hom(G,\mathbb{C})=0 or \mu_\varphi(1_G)=0, where 1_G is the trivial character of G.
