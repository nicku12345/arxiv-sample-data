In a first result we prove that every continuous local triple derivation on a JB^*-triple is a triple derivation. We also give an automatic continuity result, that is, we show that local triple derivations on a JB^*-triple are continuous even if not assumed a priori to be so. In particular every local triple derivation on a C^*-algebra is a triple derivation. We also explore the connections between (bounded local) triple derivations and generalised (Jordan) derivations on a C^*-algebra.
