If A_n is a sequence of C*-algebras, then the C*-algebra \prod A_n / \bigoplus A_n is called a reduced product. We prove, assuming Todorcevic's Axiom and Martin's Axiom, that every isomorphism between two reduced products of separable, unital UHF algebras must be definable in a strong sense. As a corollary we deduce that two such reduced products \prod A_n / \bigoplus A_n and \prod B_n / \bigoplus B_n are isomorphic if and only if, up to an almost-permutation of \mathbb{N}, A_n is isomorphic to B_n.
