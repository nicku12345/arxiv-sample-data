We construct some inverse-closed algebras of bounded integral operators with operator-valued kernels, acting in spaces of vector-valued functions on locally compact groups. To this end we make systematic use of covariance algebras associated to C^*-dynamical systems defined by the abelian C^*-algebras of right uniformly continuous functions with respect to the left regular representation.
