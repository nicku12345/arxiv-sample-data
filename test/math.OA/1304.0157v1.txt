We present some generalized Jensen type operator inequalities involving sequences of self-adjoint operators. Among other things, we prove that if f:[0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R} is a continuous convex function with f(0)\leq 0, then {equation*} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(C_i) \leq f(\sum_{i=1}^{n}C_i)-\delta_f\sum_{i=1}^{n}\widetilde{C}_i\leq f(\sum_{i=1}^{n}C_i) {equation*} for all operators C_i such that 0 \leq C_i\leq M \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i  \ (i=1,...,n) for some scalar M\geq0, where  \widetilde{C_i} = 1/2 - |\frac{C_i}{M}- 1/2 | and \delta_f = f(0)+f(M) - 2 f(\frac{M}{2}).
