In this paper we investigate a notion of relative operator entropy, which develops the theory started by J.I. Fujii and E. Kamei [Math. Japonica 34 (1989), 341--348]. For two finite sequences \mathbf{A}=(A_1,...,A_n) and \mathbf{B}=(B_1,...,B_n) of positive operators acting on a Hilbert space, a real number q and an operator monotone function f we extend the concept of entropy by  S_q^f(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}):=\sum_{j=1}^nA_j^{1/2}(A_j^{-1/2}B_jA_j^{-1/2})^qf(A_j^{-1/2}B_jA_j^{-1/2})A_j^{1/2}\,,  and then give upper and lower bounds for S_q^f(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{B}) as an extension of an inequality due to T. Furuta [Linear Algebra Appl. 381 (2004), 219--235] under certain conditions. Afterwards, some inequalities concerning the classical Shannon entropy are drawn from it.
