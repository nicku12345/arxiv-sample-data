In the article "Construction of the continuous hull for the combinatorics of a regular pentagonal tiling of the plane" we constructed a compact topological space for the combinatorics of "A regular pentagonal tiling of the plane", which we call the continuous hull. We also constructed a substitution map on the space which turns out to be a homeomorphism, and so the pair given by the continuous hull and the substitution map yields a dynamical system. In this paper we show how we can write this dynamical system as another dynamical system given by an inverse limit and a right shift map.
