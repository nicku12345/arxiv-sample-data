We define spectral gap actions of discrete groups on von Neumann algebras and study their relations with invariant states. We will show that a finitely generated ICC group \Gamma is inner amenable if and only if there exist more than one inner invariant states on the group von Neumann algebra L(\Gamma). Moreover, a countable discrete group \Gamma has property (T) if and only if for any action \alpha of \Gamma on a von Neumann algebra N, every \alpha-invariant state on N is a weak-^*-limit of a net of normal \alpha-invariant states.
