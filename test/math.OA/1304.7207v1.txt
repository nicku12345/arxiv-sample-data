In this paper, we study the representation of orthogonally additive mappings acting on Hilbert C^*-modules and Hilbert H^*-modules. One of our main results shows that every continuous orthogonally additive mapping f from a Hilbert module W over \K(\H) or \H\S(\H) to a complex normed space is of the form f(x)=T(x)+\Phi(< x, x >) for all x\in W, where T is a continuous additive mapping, and \Phi is a continuous linear mapping.
