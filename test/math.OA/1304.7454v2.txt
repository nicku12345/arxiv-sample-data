In this paper, we obtain a complete description of the class of n-tuples (n >= 2) of doubly commuting isometries. In particular, we present a several variables analogue of the Wold decomposition for isometries on Hilbert spaces. Our main result is a generalization of M. Slocinski's Wold-type decomposition of a pair of doubly commuting isometries.
