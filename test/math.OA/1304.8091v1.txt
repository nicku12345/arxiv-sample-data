We investigate the deformation of involution and multiplication in a unital C^*-algebra when its norm is fixed. Our main result is to present all multiplications and involutions on a given C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} under which \mathcal{A} is still a C^*-algebra whereas we keep the norm unchanged. For each invertible element a\in\mathcal{A} we also introduce an involution and a multiplication making \mathcal{A} into a C^*-algebra in which a becomes a positive element. Further, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for that the center of a unital C^*-algebra \mathcal{A} is trivial.
