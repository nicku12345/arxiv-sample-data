We introduce a class of automorphisms of compact quantum groups which may be thought of as inner automorphisms and explore the behaviour of normal subgroups of compact quantum groups under these automorphisms. We also define the notion of center of a compact quantum group and compute the center for several examples. We briefly touch upon the commutator subgroup of a compact quantum group and discuss how its relation with the center can be different from the classical case.
