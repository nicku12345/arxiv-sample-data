The quantum symmetry group of the inductive limit of C*-algebras equipped with orthogonal filtrations is shown to be the projective limit of the quantum symmetry groups of the C*-algebras appearing in the sequence. Some explicit examples of such projective limits are studied, including the case of quantum symmetry groups of the duals of finite symmetric groups, which do not fit directly into the framework of the main theorem and require further specific study. The investigations reveal a deep connection between quantum symmetry groups of discrete group duals and the doubling construction for Hopf algebras.
