In this paper, we study the structure of operators in a type \mathrm{I}_{n} von Neumann algebra \mathscr{A}. Inspired by the Jordan canonical form theorem, our main motivation is to figure out the relation between the structure of an operator A in \mathscr{A} and the property that a bounded maximal abelian set of idempotents contained in the relative commutant \{A\}^{\prime} \cap\mathscr{A} is unique up to similarity. Furthermore, we classify this class of operators with the property by K-theory for Banach algebras. Some views and techniques are from von Neumann's reduction theory.
