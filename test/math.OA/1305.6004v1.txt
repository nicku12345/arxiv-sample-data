A detailed study of the semigroup C^\ast-algebra is presented. This C^\ast-algebra appears as a "deformation" of the continuous functions algebra on a compact abelian group. Considering semigroup C^\ast-algebras in this framework we construct a compact quantum semigroups category. Then the initial group is a compact subgroup of the new compact quantum semigroup, the natural action of this group is described. The dual space of such C^\ast-algebra is endowed with Banach *-algebra structure, which contains the algebra of measures on a compact group. The dense weak Hopf *-algebra is given. It is shown that the constructed category of compact quantum semigroups can be embedded to the category of abelian semigroups.
