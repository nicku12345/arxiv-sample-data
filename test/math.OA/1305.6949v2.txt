Given a compact semisimple Lie group G of rank r, and a parameter q>0, we can define new associativity morphisms in Rep(Gq) using a 3-cocycle \Phi on the dual of the center of G, thus getting a new tensor category Rep(Gq)^\Phi. For a class of cocycles \Phi we construct compact quantum groups G^\tau_q with representation categories Rep(Gq)^\Phi. The construction depends on the choice of an r-tuple \tau of elements in the center of G. In the simplest case of G=SU(2) and \tau=-1, our construction produces Woronowicz's quantum group SU_{-q}(2) out of SUq(2). More generally, for G=SU(n), we get quantum group realizations of the Kazhdan-Wenzl categories.
