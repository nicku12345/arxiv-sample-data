Let \mathcal{A}_1 and \mathcal{A}_2 be standard operator algebras on complex Banach spaces X_1 and X_2, respectively. For k\geq2, let (i_1,...,i_m) be a sequence with terms chosen from \{1,\ldots,k\}, and assume that at least one of the terms in (i_1,\ldots,i_m) appears exactly once. Define the generalized product T_1* T_2*\cdots* T_k=T_{i_1}T_{i_2}\cdots T_{i_m} on elements in \mathcal{A}_i. Let \Phi:\mathcal{A}_1\rightarrow\mathcal{A}_2 be a map with the range containing all operators of rank at most two. We show that \Phi satisfies that \sigma_\pi(\Phi(A_1)*\cdots*\Phi(A_k))=\sigma_\pi(A_1*\cdots* A_k) for all A_1,\ldots, A_k, where \sigma_\pi(A) stands for the peripheral spectrum of A, if and only if \Phi is an isomorphism or an anti-isomorphism multiplied by an mth root of unity, and the latter case occurs only if the generalized product is quasi-semi Jordan. If X_1=H and X_2=K are complex Hilbert spaces, we characterize also maps preserving the peripheral spectrum of the skew generalized products, and prove that such maps are of the form A\mapsto cUAU^* or A\mapsto cUA^tU^*, where U\in\mathcal{B}(H,K) is a unitary operator, c\in\{1,-1\}.
