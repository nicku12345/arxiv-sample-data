In this paper, we study noncommutative varieties in polydomains in B(H)^n. The goal is to understand the structure of these varieties, determine their elements and classify them up to unitary equivalence. Using noncommutative Berezin transforms associated with each variety, we develop an operator model theory and dilation theory for large classes of varieties in noncommutative polydomains. This includes various commutative cases which are close connected to the theory of holomorphic functions in several complex variables and algebraic geometry.
