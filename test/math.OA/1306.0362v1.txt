One of the long standing questions in the theory of Schatten-von Neumann ideals of compact operators is whether their norms have the same differentiability properties as the norms of their commutative counterparts. We answer this question in the affirmative. A key technical observation underlying our proof is a discovery of connection between this question and recent affirmative resolution of L.S. Koplienko's conjecture concerning existence of higher order spectral shift functions.
