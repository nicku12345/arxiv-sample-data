We give a complete classification of the ideals of the core of the C*-algebras associated with self-similar maps under a certain condition. Any ideal is completely determined by the intersection with the coefficient algebra C(K) of the self-similar set K. The corresponding closed subset of K is described by the singularity structure of the self-similar map. In particular the core is simple if and only if the self-similar map has no branch point. A matrix representation of the core is essentially used to prove the classification.
