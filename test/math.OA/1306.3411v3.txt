We introduce a concept of bilinear ideal of jointly completely bounded mappings between operator spaces. In particular, we study the bilinear ideals \mathcal{N} of completely nuclear, \mathcal{I } of completely integral, \mathcal{E} of completely extendible bilinear mappings, \mathcal{MB} multiplicatively bounded and its symmetrization \mathcal{SMB}. We prove some basic properties of them, one of which is the fact that \mathcal{I} is naturally identified with the ideal of (linear) completely integral mappings on the injective operator space tensor product.
