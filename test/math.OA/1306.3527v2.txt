We obtain results on the unitary equivalence of weak contractions of class C_0 to their Jordan models under an assumption on their commutants. In particular, our work addresses the case of arbitrary finite multiplicity. The main tool is the theory of boundary representations due to Arveson. We also generalize and improve previously known results concerning unitary equivalence and similarity to Jordan models when the minimal function is a Blaschke product.
