Let \A be a ring with local units, \E a set of local units for \A, \G an abelian group and \alpha a partial action of \G by ideals of \A that contain local units and such that the partial skew group ring \A\star_{\alpha} \G is associative. We show that \A\star_{\alpha} \G is simple if and only if \A is \G-simple and the center of the corner e\delta_0 (\A\star_{\alpha} \G) e \delta_0 is a field for all e\in \E. We apply the result to characterize simplicity of partial skew group rings in two cases, namely for partial skew group rings arising from partial actions by clopen subsets of a compact set and partial actions on the set level.
