We study weak amenability for locally compact quantum groups in the sense of Kustermans and Vaes. In particular, we focus on non-discrete examples. We prove that a coamenable quantum group is weakly amenable if there exists a net of positive, scaling invariant elements in the Fourier algebra A(G) whose representing multipliers form an approximate identity in C_0(G) that is bounded in the M_0A(G) norm; the bound being an upper estimate for the associated Cowling-Haagerup constant.   As an application, we find the appropriate approximation properties of the extended quantum SU(1,1) group and its dual. That is, we prove that it is weakly amenable and coamenable. Furthermore, it has the Haagerup property in the quantum group sense, introduced by Daws, Fima, Skalski and White.
