The present notes provide a proof of i^*(\mathbb{C}P+\mathbb{C}(I-P)\,;\mathbb{C}Q+\mathbb{C}(I-Q)) = -\chi_\mathrm{orb}(P,Q) for any pair of projections P,Q with \tau(P)=\tau(Q)=1/2. The proof includes new extra observations, such as a subordination result in terms of Loewner equations. A study of the general case is also given.
