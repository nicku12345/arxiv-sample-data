In this article, we consider a twisted partial action \alpha of a group G on a ring R and it is associated partial crossed product R*_{\alpha}^wG. We study necessary and sufficient conditions for the commutativity and simplicity of R*_{\alpha}^wG.   Let R=C(X) the algebra of continuous functions of a topological space X on the complex numbers and C(X)*_{\alpha}G the partial skew group ring, where \alpha is a partial action of a topological group G on C(X). We study some topological properties to obtain results on the algebra C(X). Also, we study the simplicity of C(X)*_{\alpha}G using topological properties and the results about the simplicity of partial crossed product obtained for R*_{\alpha}^wG.
