We introduce the dynamic comparison property for minimal dynamical systems which has applications to the study of crossed product C*-algebras. We demonstrate that this property holds for a large class of systems which includes all examples where the underlying space is finite-dimensional, as well as for an explicit infinite-dimensional example, showing that the it is strictly weaker than finite-dimensionality in general.
