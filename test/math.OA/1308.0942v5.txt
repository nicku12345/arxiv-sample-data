Let G be a subgroup of a discrete (countable) group \Gamma. We introduce a notion of relative inner amenability of G in \Gamma, we prove some equivalent conditions and provide examples as well as counter-examples. We also discuss briefly the corresponding relative property gamma for pairs of finite factors and we deduce from this a characterization of discrete, icc groups which do not have Kazhdan's property T.
