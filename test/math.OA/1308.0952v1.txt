In the convex set of all 3\ot 3 states with positive partial transposes, we show that one can take two extreme points whose convex combinations belong to the interior of the convex set. Their convex combinations may be even in the interior of the convex set of all separable states. In general, we need at least mn extreme points to get an interior point by their convex combination, for the case of the convex set of all m\ot n separable states. This shows a sharp distinction between PPT states and separable states. We also consider the same questions for positive maps and decomposable maps.
