We compute the generating series for the simplest class of bi-free cumulants, beyond free cumulants, the two-bands bi-free cumulants of a pair of a left and a right variable. We also consider two-faced systems with a commutation condition implying that two-bands moments, that is expectation values of the product of a monomial of left and a monomial of right variables determine the other moments. Examples include hyponormal operators, dual systems in free entropy theory and bi-partite systems.
