We show that the K-theory cosheaf is a complete invariant for separable continuous fields with vanishing boundary maps over a finite-dimensional compact metrizable topological space whose fibers are stable Kirchberg algebras with rational K-theory groups satisfying the universal coefficient theorem. We provide a range result for fields in this class with finite-dimensional K-theory. There are versions of both results for unital continuous fields.
