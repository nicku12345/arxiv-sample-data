We study the Hopf structure of a class of dual operator algebras corresponding to certain semigroups. This class of algebras arises in dilation theory, and includes the noncommutative analytic Toeplitz algebra and the multiplier algebra of the Drury-Arveson space, which correspond to the free semigroup and the free commutative semigroup respectively. The preduals of the algebras in this class naturally form Hopf (convolution) algebras. The original algebras and their preduals form (non-self-adjoint) dual Hopf algebras in the sense of Effros and Ruan. We study these algebras from this perspective, and obtain a number of results about their structure.
