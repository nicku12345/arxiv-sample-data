We construct subfactors where one of the principal graphs is a spoke graph using an algorithm which computes two-strand jellyfish relations. One of the subfactors we construct is a 3^{Z/4} subfactor known to Izumi, which has not previously appeared in the literature. To do so, we provide a systematic treatment of the space of second annular consequences, which is analogous to Jones' treatment of the space of first annular consequences in his quadratic tangles article.   This article is the natural followup to two recent articles on spoke subfactor planar algebras and the jellyfish algorithm. Work of Bigelow-Penneys explains the connection between spoke subfactor planar algebras and the jellyfish algorithm, and work of Morrison-Penneys automates the construction of subfactors where both principal graphs are spoke graphs using one-strand jellyfish.
