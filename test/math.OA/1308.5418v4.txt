We study the topological variant of Rokhlin dimension for topological dynamical systems (X,{\alpha},Z^m) in the case where X is assumed to have finite covering dimension. Finite Rokhlin dimension in this sense is a property that implies finite Rokhlin dimension of the induced action on C*-algebraic level, as was discussed in a recent paper by Ilan Hirshberg, Wilhelm Winter and Joachim Zacharias. In particular, it implies under these conditions that the transformation group C*-algebra has finite nuclear dimension. Generalizing a result of Yonatan Gutman, we show that free Z^m-actions on finite dimensional spaces satisfy a strengthened version of the so-called marker property, which yields finite Rokhlin dimension for said actions.
