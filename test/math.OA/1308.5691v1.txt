In this article, we classify all standard invariants that can arise from a composed inclusion of an A_3 with an A_4 subfactor. More precisely, if \mathcal{N}\subset \mathcal{P} is the A_3 subfactor and \mathcal{P}\subset\mathcal{M} is the A_4 subfactor, then only four standard invariants can arise from the composed inclusion \mathcal{N}\subset\mathcal{M}. This answers a question posed by Bisch and Haagerup in 1994. The techniques of this paper also show that there are exactly four standard invariants for the composed inclusion of two A_4 subfactors.
