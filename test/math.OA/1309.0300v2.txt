Zappa-Sz\'ep products of semigroups encompass both the self-similar group actions of Nekrashevych and the quasi-lattice-ordered groups of Nica. We use Li's construction of semigroup C^*-algebras to associate a C^*-algebra to Zappa-Sz\'ep products and give an explicit presentation of the algebra. We then define a quotient C^*-algebra that generalises the Cuntz-Pimsner algebras for self-similar actions. We indicate how known examples, previously viewed as distinct classes, fit into our unifying framework. We specifically discuss the Baumslag-Solitar groups, the binary adding machine, the semigroup \mathbb{N}\rtimes\mathbb{N}^\times, and the ax+b-semigroup \mathbb{Z}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}^\times.
