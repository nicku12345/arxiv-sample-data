Suppose that a compact quantum group \clq acts faithfully on a smooth, compact, connected manifold M, i.e. has a C^* (co)-action \alpha on C(M), such that the action \alpha is isometric in the sense of \cite{Goswami} for some Riemannian structure on M.   We prove that \clq must be commutative as a C^{\ast} algebra i.e. \clq\cong C(G) for some compact group G acting smoothly on M. In particular, the quantum isometry group of M (in the sense of \cite{Goswami}) coincides with C(ISO(M)).
