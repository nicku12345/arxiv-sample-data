For p \in [1, \infty), we define and study full and reduced crossed products of algebras of operators on \sigma-finite L^p spaces by isometric actions of second countable locally compact groups. We give universal properties for both crossed products. When the group is abelian, we prove the existence of a dual action on the full and reduced L^p operator crossed products. When the group is discrete, we construct a conditional expectation to the original algebra which is faithful in a suitable sense. For a free action of a discrete group on a compact metric space X, we identify all traces on the reduced L^p operator crossed product, and if the action is also minimal we show that the reduced L^p operator crossed product is simple. We prove that the full and reduced L^p operator crossed products of an amenable L^p operator algebra by a discrete amenable group are again amenable. We prove a Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence for the K-theory of reduced L^p operator crossed products by {\mathbb{Z}}. We show that the L^p analogs {\mathcal{O}}_d^p of the Cuntz algebras {\mathcal{O}}_d are stably isomorphic to reduced L^p operator crossed products of stabilized L^p UHF algebra by {\mathbb{Z}}, and show that K_0 ({\mathcal{O}}_d^p) \cong {\mathbb{Z}} / (d - 1) {\mathbb{Z}} and K_1 ({\mathcal{O}}_d^p) = 0.
