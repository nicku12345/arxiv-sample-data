We consider the translation dynamics on the C^*-algebra \IM =\otimes_{n \in \IZ}\!M^{(n)}(\IC) of two sided infinite tensor product of d dimensional matrices \!M^{(n)}(\IC)=\!M_d(\IC) over the field of complex numbers \IC and its restriction to the maximal abelian C^* sub-algebra \ID^e = \otimes_{n \in \IZ}\!D_e^{(n)}(\IC) of \IM, where each \!D_e^{(n)}(\IC)=\!D_d(\IC) is the algebra of d dimensional diagonal matrices with respect to an orthonormal basis e=(e_i) of \IC^d. We prove that any two translation invariant Kolmogorov pure states of \IM give unitarily equivalent dynamics in their Gelfand-Naimark-Segal spaces. Furthermore, for a class of Kolmogorov pure states of \IM satisfying some additional invariance, we prove Kolmogorov states give isomorphic translation dynamics if their restrictions to the maximal abelian C^* sub-algebra \ID^e of \IM are isomorphic. On the other hand, we prove that the translation dynamics with two infinite tensor product translation invariant faithful states of \IM are isomorphic if and only if their mean entropies are equal.
