We study holomorphic maps between C^*-algebras A and B. When f:B_A (0,\varrho) \longrightarrow B is a holomorphic mapping whose Taylor series at zero is uniformly converging in some open unit ball U=B_{A}(0,\delta) and we assume that f is orthogonality preserving on A_{sa}\cap U, orthogonally additive on U and f(U) contains an invertible element in B, then there exist a sequence (h_n) in B^{**} and Jordan ^*-homomorphisms \Theta, \widetilde{\Theta} : M(A) \to B^{**} such that  f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty h_n \widetilde{\Theta} (a^n)= \sum_{n=1}^\infty {\Theta} (a^n) h_n, uniformly in a\in U. When B is abelian the hypothesis of B being unital and f(U)\cap \hbox{inv} (B) \neq \emptyset can be relaxed to get the same statement.
