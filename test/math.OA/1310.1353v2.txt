We consider isomorphisms between quotient algebras of \prod_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{M}_{k(n)}(\mathbb{C}) associated with Borel ideals on \mathbb{N} and prove that it is relatively consistent with \textbf{ZFC} that all of these isomorphisms are trivial, in the sense that they lift to a *-homomorphism from \prod_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{M}_{k(n)}(\mathbb{C}) into itself. This generalizes a result of Farah-Shelah who proved this result for centers of these algebras (in its dual form). We also use a simpler forcing notion and completely remove the large cardinal assumption used by Farah-Shelah.
