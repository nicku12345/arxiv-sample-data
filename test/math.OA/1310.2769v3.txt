We show that for every pair of matrices (S,P), having the closed symmetrized bidisc \Gamma as a spectral set, there is a one dimensional complex algebraic variety \Lambda in \Gamma such that for every matrix valued polynomial f, the norm of f(S,P) is less then the sup norm of f on \Lambda.   The variety \Lambda is shown to have a particular determinantal representation, related to the so-called "fundamental operator" of the pair (S,P).   When (S,P) is a strict \Gamma-contraction, then \Lambda is a distinguished variety in the symmetrized bidisc, i.e., a one dimensional algebraic variety that exits the symmetrized bidisc through its distinguished boundary. We characterize all distinguished varieties of the symmetrized bidisc by a determinantal representation as above.
