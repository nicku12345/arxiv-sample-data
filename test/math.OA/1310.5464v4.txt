We obtained a "decomposition scheme" of C*-algebras. We show that the classes of discrete C*-algebras (as defined by Peligard and Zsido), type II C*-algebras and type III C*-algebras (both defined by Cuntz and Pedersen) form a good framework to "classify" C*-algebras. In particular, we found that these classes are closed under strong Morita equivalence, hereditary C*-subalgebras as well as taking "essential extension" and "normal quotient". Furthermore, there exist the largest discrete finite ideal A_{d,1}, the largest discrete essentially infinite ideal A_{d,\infty}, the largest type II finite ideal A_{II,1}, the largest type II essentially infinite ideal A_{II,\infty}, and the largest type III ideal A_{III} of any C*-algebra A such that A_{d,1} + A_{d,\infty} + A_{II,1} + A_{II,\infty} + A_{III} is an essential ideal of A. This "decomposition" extends the corresponding one for W^*-algebras.   We also give a closer look at C*-algebras with Hausdorff primitive spectrum, AW*-algebras as well as local multiplier algebras of C*-algebras. We find that these algebras can be decomposed into continuous fields of prime C*-algebras over a locally compact Hausdorff space, with each fiber being non-zero and of one of the five types mentioned above.
