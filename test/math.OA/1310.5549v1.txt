Let \Omega be a tiling space and let G be the maximal group of rotations which fixes \Omega. Then the cohomology of \Omega and \Omega/G are both invariants which give useful geometric information about the tilings in \Omega. The noncommutative analog of the cohomology of \Omega is the K-theory of a C*-algebra associated to \Omega, and for translationally finite tilings of dimension 2 or less the K-theory is isomorphic to the direct sum of cohomology groups. In this paper we give a prescription for calculating the noncommutative analog of the cohomology of \Omega/G, that is, the K-theory of the crossed product of the tiling C*-algebra by G. We also provide a table with some calculated K-groups for many common examples, including the Penrose and pinwheel tilings.
