We prove that for any infinite, maximal amenable subgroup H in a hyperbolic group G, the von Neumann subalgebra LH is maximal amenable inside LG. It provides many new, explicit examples of maximal amenable subalgebras in II_1 factors. We also prove similar maximal amenability results for direct products of relatively hyperbolic groups and orbit equivalence relations arising from measure-preserving actions of such groups.
