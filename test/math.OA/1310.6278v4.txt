We study the deformed tensor products of complex Hadamard matrices, L_{ia,jb}=Q_{ib}H_{ij}K_{ab}. One problem is that of reconstructing the quantum group G_L\subset S_{NM}^+ out of the quantum groups G_H\subset S_N^+,G_K\subset S_M^+ and of the parameter matrix Q\in M_{N\times M}(\mathbb T), and we obtain here several results, including complete results in the Fourier matrix case, H=F_N,K=F_M, when the parameter matrix Q is generic.
