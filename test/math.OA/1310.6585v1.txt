This paper is concerned with pseudodifferential calculus on manifolds with fibred corners. Following work of Connes, Monthubert, Skandalis and Androulidakis, we associate to every manifold with fibred corners a longitudinally smooth groupoid which algebraic and differential structure is explicitely described. This groupoid has a natural geometric meaning as a holonomy groupoid of singular foliation, it is a singular leaf space in the sense of Androulidakis and Skandalis. We then show that the associated compactly supported pseudodifferential calculus coincides with Mazzeo and Melrose's phi-calculus and we introduce an extended algebra of smoothing operators that is shown to be stable under holomorphic functional calculus. This result allows the interpretation of phi-calculus as the pseudodifferential calculus associated with the holonomy groupoid of the singular foliation defined by the manifold with fibred corners. It is a key step to set the index theory of those singular manifolds in the noncommutative geometry framework.
