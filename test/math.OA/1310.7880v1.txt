Let (M_i)_{i} be a (finite or infinite) family of finite von Neumann algebras with a common subalgebra P. When \varphi:\IN\rightarrow\IC is a function, we define the radial multiplier M_\varphi on the amalgamated free product M=M_1\free_P M_2\free_P\ldots setting M_{\varphi}(x)=\varphi(n)x for every reduced expression x of length n. In this paper we give a sufficient condition on \varphi to ensure that the corresponding radial multiplier M_\varphi is a completely bounded map, and moreover we give an upper bound on its completely bounded norm. Our condition on \varphi does not depend on the choice of von Neumann algebras (M_i)_i and P. This result extends earlier results by Haagerup and M\"oller, who proved the same statement for free products without amalgamation, and M\"oller showed that the same statement holds when P has finite index in each of the M_i.
