Let \mathscr{X} be a complex Banach space and \mathcal{L}(\mathscr{X}) be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on \mathscr{X}. For a given elementary operator \Phi of length 2 on \mathcal{L}(\mathscr{X}), we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution of the equation {\rm X} \Phi=0 in the algebra of all elementary operators on \mathcal{L}(\mathscr{X}). Our approach allows us to characterize some invertible elementary operators of length 2 whose inverses are elementary operators.
