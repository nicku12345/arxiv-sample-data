Let H be a proper subgroup of a discrete group G. We introduce a notion of relative inner amenability of H in G, we prove some equivalent conditions and provide examples as well as counter-examples. We also discuss the corresponding relative property gamma for pairs of finite factors N\subset M and we deduce from this a characterization of discrete, icc groups which do not have Kazhdan's property (T).
