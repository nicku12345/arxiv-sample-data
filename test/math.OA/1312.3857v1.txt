In 1987, Woronowicz gave a definition of compact matrix quantum groups generalizing compact Lie groups in the setting of noncommutative geometry. About twenty years later, Banica and Speicher isolated a class of compact matrix quantum groups with an intrinsic combinatorial structure. These so called easy quantum groups are determined by categories of partitions. They have been proven useful in order to understand various aspects of quantum groups, in particular linked with Voiculescu's free probability theory. Furthermore, they exhibit a way to find examples of compact quantum groups besides q-deformations and quantum isometry groups. These characteristics naturally motivated attempts to fully classify them. This is completed in the present article.
