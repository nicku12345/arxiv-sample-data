Consider an exact action of discrete group G on a separable C^*-algebra A. It is shown that the reduced crossed product A\rtimes_{\sigma, \lambda} G is strongly purely infinite - provided that the action of G on any quotient A/I by a G-invariant closed ideal I\neq A is element-wise properly outer and that the action of G on A is G-separating (cf. Definition 4.1). This is the first non-trivial sufficient criterion for strong pure infiniteness of reduced crossed products of C^*-algebras A that are not G-simple. In the case A=\mathrm{C}_0(X) the notion of a G-separating action corresponds to the property that two compact sets C_1 and C_2, that are contained in open subsets C_j\subseteq U_j \subseteq X, can be mapped by elements of g_j\in G onto disjoint sets \sigma_{g_j}(C_j)\subseteq U_j, but we do not require that \sigma_{g_j}(U_j)\subseteq U_j. A generalization of strong boundary actions on compact spaces to non-unital and non-commutative C^*-algebras A (cf. Definition 6.1) is also introduced. It is stronger than the notion of G-separating actions by Proposition 6.6, because G-separation does not imply G-simplicity and there are examples of G-separating actions with reduced crossed products that are stably projection-less and non-simple.
