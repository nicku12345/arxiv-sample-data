It is well-known that a finitely generated group \Gamma has Kazhdan's property (T) if and only if the Laplacian element \Delta in {\mathbb R}[\Gamma] has a spectral gap. In this paper, we prove that this phenomenon is witnessed in {\mathbb R}[\Gamma]. Namely, \Gamma has property (T) if and only if there are a constant \kappa>0 and a finite sequence \xi_1,...,\xi_n in {\mathbb R}[\Gamma] such that \Delta^2-\kappa\Delta = \sum_i \xi_i^*\xi_i. This result suggests the possibility of finding new examples of property (T) groups by solving equations in {\mathbb R}[\Gamma], possibly with an assist of computers.
