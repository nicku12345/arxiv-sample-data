The paper introduces a general method to construct conformal measures for a local homeomorphism on a locally compact non-compact Hausdorff space, subject to mild irreducibility-like conditions. Among others the method is used to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of eigenmeasures for the dual Ruelle operator associated to a locally compact non-compact irreducible Markov shift equipped with a uniformly continuous potential function. As an application to operator algebras the results are used to determine for which \beta there are gauge invariant \beta-KMS weights on a simple graph C^*-algebra when the one-parameter automorphism group is given by a uniformly continuous real-valued function on the path space of the graph.
