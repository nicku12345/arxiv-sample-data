We survey the results on linear local and 2-local homomorphisms and zero products preserving operators between C^*-algebras, and we incorporate some new precise observations and results to prove that every bounded linear 2-local homomorphism between C^*-algebras is a homomorphism. Consequently, every linear 2-local ^*-homomorphism between C^*-algebras is a ^*-homomorphism.
