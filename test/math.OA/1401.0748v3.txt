A well-known theorem of Paulsen says that if \mathcal{A} is a unital operator algebra and \phi:\mathcal{A}\to B(\mathcal{H}) is a unital completely bounded homomorphism, then \phi is similar to a completely contractive map \phi'. Motivated by classification problems for Hilbert space contractions, we are interested in making the inverse \phi'^{-1} completely contractive as well whenever the map \phi has a completely bounded inverse. We show that there exist invertible operators X and Y such that the map  XaX^{-1}\mapsto Y\phi(a)Y^{-1}  is completely contractive and is "almost" isometric on any given finite set of elements from \mathcal{A} with non-zero spectrum. Although the map cannot be taken to be completely isometric in general, we show that this can be achieved if \mathcal{A} is completely boundedly isomorphic to either a C^*-algebra or a uniform algebra. In the case of quotient algebras of H^\infty, we translate these conditions in function theoretic terms and relate them to the classical Carleson condition.
