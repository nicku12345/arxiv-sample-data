An operator on an l^{p}-space is called band-dominated if it can be approximated, in the operator norm, by operators with a banded matrix representation. It is known that a rich band-dominated operator is \mathcal{P}-Fredholm (which is a generalization of the classical Fredholm property) if and only if all of its so-called limit operators are invertible and their inverses are uniformly bounded. We show that the condition on uniform boundedness is redundant in this statement.
