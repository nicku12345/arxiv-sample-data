We establish several operator extensions of the Chebyshev inequality. The main version deals with the Hadamard product of Hilbert space operators. More precisely, we prove that if \mathscr{A} is a C^*-algebra, T is a compact Hausdorff space equipped with a Radon measure \mu, \alpha: T\rightarrow [0, +\infty) is a measurable function and (A_t)_{t\in T}, (B_t)_{t\in T} are suitable continuous fields of operators in {\mathscr A} having the synchronous Hadamard property, then \begin{align*} \int_{T} \alpha(s) d\mu(s)\int_{T}\alpha(t)(A_t\circ B_t) d\mu(t)\geq\left(\int_{T}\alpha(t) A_t d\mu(t)\right)\circ\left(\int_{T}\alpha(s) B_s d\mu(s)\right).   \end{align*} We apply states on C^*-algebras to obtain some versions related to synchronous functions. We also present some Chebyshev type inequalities involving the singular values of positive n\times n matrices. Several applications are given as well.
