We study the C^*-algebras arising in the construction of Guionnet-Jones-Shlyakhtenko (GJS) for a planar algebra. In particular, we show they are pairwise strongly Morita equivalent, we compute their K-groups, and we prove many properties, such as simplicity, unique trace, and stable rank 1. Interestingly, we see a K-theoretic obstruction to the GJS C^*-algebra analog of Goldman-type theorems for II_1-subfactors. This is the second article in a series studying canonical C^*-algebras associated to a planar algebra.
