We introduce the notion of Krein-operator convexity in the setting of Krein spaces. We present an indefinite version of the Jensen operator inequality on Krein spaces by showing that if (\mathscr{H},J) is a Krein space, \mathcal{U} is an open set which is symmetric with respect to the real axis such that \mathcal{U}\cap\mathbb{R} consists of a segment of real axis and f is a Krein-operator convex function on \mathcal{U} with f(0)=0, then \begin{eqnarray*} f(C^{\sharp}AC)\leq^{J}C^{\sharp}f(A)C \end{eqnarray*} for all J-positive operators A and all invertible J-contractions C such that the spectra of A, C^{\sharp}AC and D^{\sharp}AD are contained in \mathcal{U}, where D is a defect operator for C^{\sharp}.\\ We also show that in contrast with usual operator convex functions the converse of this implication is not true, in general.
