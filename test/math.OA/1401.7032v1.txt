We study subproduct systems in the sense of Shalit and Solel arising from stochastic matrices on countable state spaces, and their associated operator algebras. We focus on the non-self-adjoint tensor algebra, and Viselter's generalization of the Cuntz-Pimsner C*-algebra to the context of subproduct systems. Suppose that X and Y are Arveson-Stinespring subproduct systems associated to two stochastic matrices over a countable set \Omega, and let \mathcal{T}_+(X) and \mathcal{T}_+(Y) be their tensor algebras. We show that every algebraic isomorphism from \mathcal{T}_+(X) onto \mathcal{T}_+(Y) is automatically bounded. Furthermore, \mathcal{T}_+(X) and \mathcal{T}_+(Y) are isometrically isomorphic if and only if X and Y are unitarily isomorphic up to a *-automorphism of \ell^\infty(\Omega). When \Omega is finite, we prove that \mathcal{T}_+(X) and \mathcal{T}_+(Y) are algebraically isomorphic if and only if there exists a similarity between X and Y up to a *-automorphism of \ell^\infty(\Omega). Moreover, we provide an explicit description of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra \mathcal{O}(X) in the case where \Omega is finite and the stochastic matrix is essential.
