We provide a classification of compact quantum groups, which can be obtained by the Woronowicz construction, when the arrays used in the twisted determinant condition are extensions of functions on permutations. General properties of such quantum groups are revealed with the aid of operators intertwining tensor powers of the fundamental corepresentation. Two new families of quantum groups appear: three versions of the quantum group SU_q(3) with complex q and a non-commutative analogue of the semi-direct product of two-dimensional torus with the alternating group A_3.
