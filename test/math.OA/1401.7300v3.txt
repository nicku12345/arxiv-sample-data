We construct first examples of non-trivial groups without non-cyclic free subgroups whose reduced C^\ast-algebra is simple and has unique trace. This answers a question of de la Harpe. Both torsion and torsion free examples are provided. In particular, we show that the reduced C^\ast-algebra of the free Burnside group B(m,n) of rank m\ge 2 and any sufficiently large odd exponent n is simple and has unique trace.
