Let X_1 and X_2 be complex Banach spaces with dimension at least three, \mathcal{A}_1 and \mathcal{A}_2 be standard operator algebras on X_1 and X_2, respectively. For k\geq2, let (i_1,...,i_m) be a sequence with terms chosen from \{1,\ldots,k\} and assume that at least one of the terms in (i_1,\ldots,i_m) appears exactly once. Define the generalized Jordan product T_1\circ T_2\circ\cdots\circ T_k=T_{i_1} T_{i_2}\cdots T_{i_m}+T_{i_m}\cdots T_{i_2} T_{i_1} on elements in \mathcal{A}_i. This includes the usual Jordan product A_1A_2+A_2A_1, and the Jordan triple A_1A_2A_3+A_3A_2A_1. Let \Phi:\mathcal{A}_1\rightarrow\mathcal{A}_2 be a map with range containing all operators of rank at most three. It is shown that \Phi satisfies that \sigma_\pi(\Phi(A_1)\circ\cdots\circ\Phi(A_k))=\sigma_\pi(A_1\circ\cdots\circ A_k) for all A_1, \ldots, A_k, where \sigma_\pi(A) stands for the peripheral spectrum of A, if and only if \Phi is a Jordan isomorphism multiplied by an mth root of unity.
