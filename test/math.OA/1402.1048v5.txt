We study the discrete quantum groups \Gamma whose group algebra has an inner faithful representation of type \pi:C^*(\Gamma)\to M_K(\mathbb C). Such a representation can be thought of as coming from an embedding \Gamma\subset U_K. Our main result, concerning a certain class of examples of such quantum groups, is an asymptotic convergence theorem for the random walk on \Gamma. The proof uses various algebraic and probabilistic techniques.
