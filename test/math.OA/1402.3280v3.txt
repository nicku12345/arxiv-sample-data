This paper constitutes a first step in the author's program to investigate the question of when a homotopy of 2-cocycles \omega = \{\omega_t\}_{t \in [0,1]} on a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid \mathcal{G} induces an isomorphism of the K-theory groups of the reduced twisted groupoid C^*-algebras: K_*(C^*_r(\mathcal{G}, \omega_0)) \cong K_*(C^*_r(\mathcal{G}, \omega_1)). Generalizing work of Echterhoff, L\"uck, Phillips, and Walters from 2010, we show that if \mathcal{G} = G \ltimes X is a second countable locally compact transformation group, then whenever G satisfies the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients, a homotopy \omega = \{\omega_t\}_{t \in [0,1]} of 2-cocycles on G \ltimes X gives rise to an isomorphism K_*(C^*_r(G \ltimes X, \omega_0)) \cong K_*(C^*_r(G \ltimes X, \omega_1)).
