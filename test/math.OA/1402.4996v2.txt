We study index theory for manifolds with Baas-Sullivan singularities using geometric K-homology with coefficients in a unital C*-algebra. In particular, we define a natural analog of the Baum-Connes assembly map for a torsion-free discrete group in the context of these singular spaces. The cases of singularities modelled on k-points (i.e., z/k-manifolds) and the circle are discussed in detail. In the case of the former, the associated index theorem is related to the Freed-Melrose index theorem; in the case of latter, the index theorem is related to work of Rosenberg.
