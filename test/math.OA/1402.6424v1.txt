Let E and F be two Hilbert C^*-modules over C^*-algebras A and B, respectively. Let T be a surjective linear isometry from E onto F and \varphi a map from A into B. We will prove in this paper that if the C^*-algebras A and B are commutative, then T preserves the inner products and T is a module map, i.e., there exists a *-isomorphism \varphi between the C^*-algebras such that  \langle Tx,Ty\rangle=\varphi(\langle x,y\rangle),  and  T(xa)=T(x)\varphi(a).  In case A or B is noncommutative C^*-algebra, T may not satisfy the equations above in general. We will also give some condition such that T preserves the inner products and T is a module map.
