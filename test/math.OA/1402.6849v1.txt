Let H:M_m\to M_m be a holomorphic function of the algebra M_m of complex m\times m matrices. Suppose that H is orthogonally additive and orthogonally multiplicative on self-adjoint elements. We show that either the range of H consists of zero trace elements, or there is a scalar sequence \{\lambda_n\} and an invertible S in M_m such that  H(x) =\sum_{n\geq 1} \lambda_n S^{-1}x^nS, \quad\forall x \in M_m,%\eqno{(\ddag)}  or  H(x) =\sum_{n\geq 1} \lambda_n S^{-1}(x^t)^nS, \quad\forall x \in M_m.  Here, x^t is the transpose of the matrix x. In the latter case, we always have the first representation form when H also preserves zero products. We also discuss the cases where the domain and the range carry different dimensions.
