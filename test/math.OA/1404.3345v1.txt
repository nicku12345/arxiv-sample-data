In the present paper we investigate Banach--Kantorovich algebras over faithful solid subalgebras of algebras measurable functions. We prove that any Banach--Kantorovich algebra over faithful solid subalgebras of algebra measurable functions represented as a measurable bundle of Banach algebras with vector-valued lifting. We apply such representation to the spectrum of elements Banach--Kantorovich algebras.
