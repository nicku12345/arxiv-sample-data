Associated to an Hadamard matrix H\in M_N(\mathbb C) is the spectral measure \mu\in\mathcal P[0,N] of the corresponding Hopf image algebra, A=C(G) with G\subset S_N^+. We study here a certain family of discrete measures \mu^r\in\mathcal P[0,N], coming from the idempotent state theory of G, which converge in Ces\`aro limit to \mu. Our main result is a duality formula of type \int_0^N(x/N)^pd\mu^r(x)=\int_0^N(x/N)^rd\nu^p(x), where \mu^r,\nu^r are the truncations of the spectral measures \mu,\nu associated to H,H^t. We prove as well, using these truncations \mu^r,\nu^r, that for any deformed Fourier matrix H=F_M\otimes_QF_N we have \mu=\nu.
