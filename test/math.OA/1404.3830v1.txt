Let \alpha:G \curvearrowright M be a spatial action of countable abelian group on a "spatial" von Neumann algebra M and S be its unital subsemigroup with G=S^{-1}S. We explicitly compute the essential commutant and the essential fixed-points, modulo the Schatten p-class or the compact operators, of the w^*-semicrossed product of M by S when M' contains no non-zero compact operators. We also prove a weaker result when M is a von Neumann algebra on a finite dimensional Hilbert space and (G,S)=(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_{+}), which extends a famous result due to Davidson (1977) for the classical analytic Toeplitz operators.
