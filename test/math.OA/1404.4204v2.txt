Kazhdan and Wenzl classified all rigid tensor categories with fusion ring isomorphic to the fusion ring of the group SU(d). In this paper we consider the C^*-analogue of this problem. Given a rigid C^*-tensor category \mathcal{C} with fusion ring isomorphic to the fusion ring of the group SU(d), we can extract a constant q from \mathcal{C} such that there exists a *-representation of the Hecke algebra H_n(q) into \mathcal{C}. The categorical trace on \mathcal{C} induces a Markov trace on H_n(q). Using this Markov trace and a representation of H_n(q) in \textrm{Rep}\,(SU_{\sqrt{q}}(d)) we show that \mathcal{C} is equivalent to a twist of the category \textrm{Rep}\,(SU_{\sqrt{q}}(d)). Furthermore a sufficient condition on a C^*-tensor category \mathcal{C} is given for existence of an embedding of a twist of \textrm{Rep}\,(SU_{\sqrt{q}}(d)) in \mathcal{C}.
