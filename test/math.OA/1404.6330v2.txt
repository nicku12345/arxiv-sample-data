The dual Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity is a generalization of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance to the class of Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces, designed to be well-behaved with respect to C*-algebraic structures. In this paper, we present a variant of the dual propinquity for which the triangle inequality is established without the recourse to the notion of journeys, or finite paths of tunnels. Since the triangle inequality has been a challenge to establish within the setting of Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces for quite some time, and since journeys can be a complicated tool, this new form of the dual propinquity is a significant theoretical and practical improvement. On the other hand, our new metric is equivalent to the dual propinquity, and thus inherits all its properties.
