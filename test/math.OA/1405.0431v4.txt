Let \mathcal{M} be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a faithful semifinite normal weight \phi and \mathcal{N} be a von Neumann subalgebra of \mathcal{M} such that the restriction of \phi to \mathcal{N} is semifinite and such that \mathcal{N} is invariant by the modular group of \phi. Let \mathcal{E} be the weight preserving conditional expectation from \mathcal{M} onto \mathcal{N}. We prove the following inequality: \[\|x\|_p^2\ge\bigl \|\mathcal{E}(x)\bigr\|_p^2+(p-1)\bigl\|x-\mathcal{E}(x)\bigr\|_p^2, \qquad x\in L_p(\mathcal{M}),1<p\le2,\] which extends the celebrated Ball-Carlen-Lieb convexity inequality. As an application we show that there exists \varepsilon_0>0 such that for any free group \mathbb{F}_n and any q\ge4-\varepsilon_0, \[\|P_t\|_{2\to q}\le1\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad t\ge\log{\sqrt{q-1}},\] where (P_t) is the Poisson semigroup defined by the natural length function of  \mathbb{F}_n.
