Let \mathfrak{M} be a semifinite von Neumann algebra on a Hilbert space equipped with a faithful normal semifinite trace \tau. A closed densely defined operator x affiliated with \mathfrak{M} is called \tau-measurable if there exists a number \lambda \geq 0 such that \tau \left(e^{|x|}(\lambda,\infty)\right)<\infty. A number of useful inequalities, which are known for the trace on Hilbert space operators, are extended to trace on \tau-measurable operators. In particular, these inequalities imply Clarkson inequalities for n-tuples of \tau-measurable operators. A general parallelogram law for \tau-measurable operators are given as well.
