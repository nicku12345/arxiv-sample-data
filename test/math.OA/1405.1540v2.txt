The study of existence of a universal C^*-completion of the ^*-algebra canonically associated to a Hecke pair was initiated by Hall, who proved that the Hecke algebra associated to (\operatorname{SL}_2(\Qp), \operatorname{SL}_2(\Zp)) does not admit a universal C^*-completion. Kaliszewski, Landstad and Quigg studied the problem by placing it in the framework of Fell-Rieffel equivalence, and highlighted the role of other C^*-completions. In the case of the pair (\operatorname{SL}_n(\Qp), \operatorname{SL}_n(\Zp)) for n\geq 3 we show, invoking property (T) of \operatorname{SL}_n(\Qp), that the C^*-completion of the L^1-Banach algebra and the corner of C^*(\operatorname{SL}_n(\Qp)) determined by the subgroup are distinct. In fact, we prove a more general result valid for a simple algebraic group of rank at least 2 over a \mathfrak{p}-adic field with a good choice of a maximal compact open subgroup.
