As the reversed version of usual symmetric norms, we introduce the notion of symmetric anti-norms \|\cdot\|_! defined on the positive operators affiliated with a finite von Neumann algebra with a finite normal trace. Related to symmetric anti-norms, we develop majorization theory and superadditivity inequalities of the form \|\psi(A+B)\|_!\ge\|\psi(A)\|_!+\|\psi(B)\|_! for a wide class of functions \psi.
