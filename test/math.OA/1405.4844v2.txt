The well-known asymmetric form of Putnam-Fuglede theorem asserts that if A and B are bounded normal operators and AX = XB^* for some bounded operator X, then A^*X = XB. In this paper we showed that the above theorem does not hold for paranormal operator A, even if we assume that B has to be unitary and an operator X is taken from Hilbert-Schmidt class. Additionally, we showed the similar resualt for *-paranormal operators.
