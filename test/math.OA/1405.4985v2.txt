We show by a counter example the failure of rational dilation on the tetrablock, a polynomially convex and non-convex domain in \mathbb C^3, defined as  \mathbb E = \{ (x_1,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb C^3\,:\, 1-zx_1-wx_2+zwx_3\neq 0 \textup{ whenever } |z|\leq 1, |w|\leq 1 \}.  A commuting triple of operators (T_1,T_2,T_3) for which the closed tetrablock \overline{\mathbb E} is a spectral set, is called an \mathbb E-contraction. For an \mathbb E-contraction (T_1,T_2,T_3), the two operator equations  T_1-T_2^*T_3=D_{T_3}X_1D_{T_3} \textup{ and } T_2-T_1^*T_3= D_{T_3}X_2D_{T_3}, \quad D_{T_3}=(I-T_3^*T_3)^{\frac{1}{2}}, have unique solutions A_1,A_2 on \mathcal D_{T_3}=\overline{Ran} D_{T_3} and they are called the fundamental operators of (T_1,T_2,T_3). For a particular class of \mathbb E-contractions, we prove it necessary for the existence of rational dilation that the corresponding fundamental operators A_1,A_2 satisfy the conditions \begin{equation}\label{abstract} A_1A_2=A_2A_1 \textup{ and } A_1^*A_1-A_1A_1^*=A_2^*A_2-A_2A_2^*. \end{equation} Then we construct an \mathbb E-contraction from that particular class which fails to satisfy (\ref{abstract}). We produce a concrete functional model for pure \mathbb E-isometries, a class of E-contractions analogous to the pure isometries in one variable. The fundamental operators play the main role in this model.
