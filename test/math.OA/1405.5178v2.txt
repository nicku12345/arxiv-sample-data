We prove that (\lambda_g\mapsto e^{-t|g|^r}\lambda_g)_{t>0} defines a completely bounded semigroup of multipliers on the von Neuman algebra of hyperbolic groups for all real number r. One ingredient in the proof is the observation that a construction of Ozawa allows to characterize the radial multipliers that are bounded on every hyperbolic graph, partially generalizing results of Haagerup--Steenstrup--Szwarc and Wysocza\'nski. Another ingredient is an upper estimate of trace class norms for Hankel matrices, which is based on Peller's characterization of such norms.
