We classify up to isomorphism all non-Kac compact quantum groups with the same fusion rules and dimension function as SU(n). For this we first prove, using categorical Poisson boundary, the following general result. Let G be a coamenable compact quantum group and K be its maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type. Then any dimension-preserving unitary fiber functor Rep\ G \to Hilb_f factors, uniquely up to isomorphism, through Rep\ K. Equivalently, we have a canonical bijection H^2(\hat G; T) \cong H^2(\hat K; T). Next, we classify autoequivalences of the representation categories of twisted q-deformations of compact simple Lie groups.
