Consider a unitary representation \pi of a discrete group G, which, when restricted to an almost normal subgroup \Gamma\subseteq G, is of type II. We analyze the associated unitary representation \overline{\pi}^{\rm{p}} of G on the Hilbert space of "virtual" \Gamma_0-invariant vectors, where \Gamma_0 runs over a suitable class of finite index subgroups of \Gamma. The unitary representation \overline{\pi}^{\rm{p}} of G is uniquely determined by the requirement that the Hecke operators, for all \Gamma_0, are the "block matrix coefficients" of \overline{\pi}^{\rm{p}}.   If \pi|_\Gamma is an integer multiple of the regular representation, there exists a subspace L of the Hilbert space of the representation \pi, acting as a fundamental domain for \Gamma. In this case, the space of \Gamma-invariant vectors is identified with L.   When \pi|_\Gamma is not an integer multiple of the regular representation, (e.g. if G=PGL(2,\mathbb Z[\frac{1}{p}]), \Gamma is the modular group, \pi belongs to the discrete series of representations of PSL(2,\mathbb R), and the \Gamma-invariant vectors are the cusp forms) we assume that \pi is the restriction to a subspace H_0 of a larger unitary representation having a subspace L as above.   The operator angle between the projection P_L onto L (typically the characteristic function of the fundamental domain) and the projection P_0 onto the subspace H_0 (typically a Bergman projection onto a space of analytic functions), is the analogue of the space of \Gamma- invariant vectors.   We prove that the character of the unitary representation \overline{\pi}^{\rm{p}} is uniquely determined by the character of the representation \pi.
