A discrete group \G is called rigidly symmetric if for every C^*-algebra \A the projective tensor product \ell^1(\G)\widehat\otimes\A is a symmetric Banach ^*-algebra. For such a group we show that the twisted crossed product \ell^1_{\alpha,\o}(\G;\A) is also a symmetric Banach ^*-algebra, for every twisted action (\alpha,\o) of \G in a C^*-algebra \A\,. We extend this property to other types of decay, replacing the \ell^1-condition. We also make the connection with certain classes of twisted kernels, used in a theory of integral operators involving group 2-cocycles. The algebra of these kernels is studied, both in intrinsic and in represented version.
