In this paper we introduce a class of BMO spaces which interpolate with L_p and are sufficiently large to serve as endpoints for new singular integral operators. More precisely, let (\Omega, \Sigma, \mu) be a \sigma-finite measure space. Consider two filtrations of \Sigma by successive refinement of two atomic \sigma-algebras \Sigma_\mathrm{a}, \Sigma_\mathrm{b} having trivial intersection. Construct the corresponding truncated martingale BMO spaces. Then, the intersection seminorm only leaves out constants and we provide a quite flexible condition on (\Sigma_\mathrm{a}, \Sigma_\mathrm{b}) so that the resulting space interpolates with L_p in the expected way. In the presence of a metric d, we obtain endpoint estimates for Calder\'on-Zygmund operators on (\Omega,\mu, d) under additional conditions on (\Sigma_\mathrm{a}, \Sigma_\mathrm{b}). These are weak forms of the \lq isoperimetric\rq{} and the \lq locally doubling\rq{} properties of Carbonaro/Mauceri/Meda which admit less concentration at the boundary. Examples of particular interest include densities of the form e^{\pm |x|^\alpha} for any \alpha > 0 or (1 + |x|^{\beta})^{-1} for any \beta \gtrsim n^{3/2}. A (limited) comparison with Tolsa's RBMO is also possible. On the other hand, a more intrinsic formulation yields a Calder\'on-Zygmund theory adapted to regular filtrations over (\Sigma_\mathrm{a}, \Sigma_\mathrm{b}) without using a metric. This generalizes well-known estimates for perfect dyadic and Haar shift operators. In contrast to previous approaches, ours extends to matrix-valued functions (via recent results from noncommutative martingale theory) for which only limited results are known and no satisfactory nondoubling theory exists so far.
