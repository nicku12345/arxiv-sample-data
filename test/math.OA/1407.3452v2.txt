Let \mathbb{G} be the quantum automorphism group of a finite dimensional C*-algebra (B,\psi) and \Gamma a discrete group. We want to compute the fusion rules of \widehat{\Gamma}\wr_* \mathbb{G}. First of all, we will revise the representation theory of \mathbb{G} and, in particular, we will describe the spaces of intertwiners by using noncrossing partitions. It will allow us to find the fusion rules of the free wreath product in the general case of a state \psi. We will also prove the simplicity of the reduced C*-algebra, when \psi is a trace, as well as the Haagerup property of L^\infty(\widehat{\Gamma}\wr_* \mathbb{G}), when \Gamma is moreover finite.
