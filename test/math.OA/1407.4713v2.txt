We develop the ring-theoretic notion of Invariant Basis Number in the context of unital C^*-algebras and their Hilbert C^*-modules. Characterization of C^*-algebras with Invariant Basis Number is given in K-theoretic terms, closure properties of the class of C^*-algebras with Invariant Basis Number are investigated, and examples of C^*-algebras both with and without the property are explored. For C^*-algebras without Invariant Basis Number we determine structure in terms of a "Basis Type" and describe a class of C^*-algebras which are universal in an appropriate sense. We conclude by investigating properties which are strictly stronger than Invariant Basis Number.
