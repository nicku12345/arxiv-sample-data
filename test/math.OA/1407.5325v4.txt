We consider various notions of equivalence in the space of bounded operators on a Hilbert space, in particular modulo finite rank, modulo Schatten p-class, and modulo compact. Using Hjorth's theory of turbulence, the latter two are shown to be not classifiable by countable structures, while the first is not reducible to the orbit equivalence relation of any Polish group action. The results for modulo finite rank and modulo compact operators are also shown for the restrictions of these equivalence relations to the space of projection operators.
