We study the relative position of three subspaces in a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. In the finite-dimensional case, Brenner described the general position of three subspaces completely. We extend it to a certain class of three subspaces in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We also give a partial result which gives a condition on a system to have a (dense) decomposition containing a pentagon.
