If X is a compact Hausdorff space and \sigma is a homeomorphism of X, then a Banach algebra \ell^1(\Sigma) of crossed product type is naturally associated with this topological dynamical system \Sigma=(X,\sigma). If X consists of one point, then \ell^1(\Sigma) is the group algebra of the integers.   We study the algebraically irreducible representations of \ell^1(\Sigma) on complex vector spaces, its primitive ideals and its structure space. The finite dimensional algebraically irreducible representations are determined up to algebraic equivalence, and a sufficiently rich family of infinite dimensional algebraically irreducible representations is constructed to be able to conclude that \ell^1(\Sigma) is semisimple. All primitive ideals of \ell^1(\Sigma) are selfadjoint, and \ell^1(\Sigma) is Hermitian if there are only periodic points in X. If X is metrisable or all points are periodic, then all primitive ideals arise as in our construction. A part of the structure space of \ell^1(\Sigma) is conditionally shown to be homeomorphic to the product of a space of finite orbits and \mathbb T. If X is a finite set, then the structure space is the topological disjoint union of a number of tori, one for each orbit in X. If all points of X have the same finite period, then it is the product of the orbit space X/\mathbb Z and \mathbb T. For rational rotations of \mathbb T, this implies that the structure space is homeomorphic to \mathbb T^2.
