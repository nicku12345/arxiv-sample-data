Using the Falcone--Takesaki theory of noncommutative integration and Kosaki's canonical representation, we construct a family of noncommutative Orlicz spaces that are associated to an arbitrary W*-algebra without any choice of weight involved, and we show that this construction is functorial over the category of W*-algebras with *-isomorphisms as arrows. Under a choice of representation, these spaces are isometrically isomorphic to Kunze's noncommutative Orlicz spaces over crossed products.
