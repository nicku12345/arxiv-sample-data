Let A and B be normal matrices with coefficients that are continuous complex-valued functions on a topological space X that has the homotopy type of a CW complex, and suppose these matrices have the same distinct eigenvalues at each point of X. We use obstruction theory to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for A and B to be unitarily equivalent. We also determine bounds on the number of possible unitary equivalence classes in terms of cohomological invariants of X.
