Let G be a locally compact group and 1\leq p<\infty. A continuous unitary representation \pi\!: G\to B(\mathcal{H}) of G is an L^p-representation if the matrix coefficient functions s\mapsto \langle \pi(s)x,x\rangle lie in L^p(G) for sufficiently many x\in \mathcal{H}. Brannan and Ruan defined the L^p-Fourier algebra A_{L^p}(G) to be the set of matrix coefficient functions of L^p-representations. Similarly, the L^p-Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B_{L^p}(G) is defined to be the weak*-closure of A_{L^p}(G) in the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B(G). These are always ideals in the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra containing the Fourier algebra. In this paper we investigate how these spaces reflect properties of the underlying group and study the structural properties of these algebras. As an application of this theory, we characterize the Fourier-Stieltjes ideals of SL(2,\mathbb R).
