We investigate the connections between order and algebra in the hereditary C*-subalgebra lattice \mathcal{H}(A) and *-annihilator ortholattice \mathscr{P}(A)^\perp. In particular, we characterize \vee-distributive elements of \mathcal{H}(A) as ideals, answering a 25 year old question, allowing the quantale structure of \mathcal{H}(A) to be completely determined from its lattice structure. We also show that \mathscr{P}(A)^\perp is separative, allowing for C*-algebra type decompositions which are completely consistent with the original von Neumann algebra type decompositions.
