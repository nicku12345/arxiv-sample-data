We construct an algebra A=\ell^{\infty \infty}({\Bbb Z}) of smooth functions which is dense in the pointwise multiplication algebra \ell^\infty({\Bbb Z}) of sup-norm bounded functions on the integers \Bbb Z. The algebra A properly contains the sum of the algebra A_c=\ell_c^\infty({\Bbb Z}) and the ideal {\cal S}({\Bbb Z}), where A_c is the algebra of finite linear combinations of projections in \ell^\infty({\Bbb Z}) and {\cal S}({\Bbb Z}) is the pointwise multiplication algebra of Schwartz functions. The algebra A is characterized as the set of functions whose "first derivatives" vanish rapidly at each point in the Stone-{\check {\rm C}}ech compactification of \Bbb Z.
