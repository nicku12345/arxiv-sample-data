We consider amalgamated direct sums (and their dual counterparts -- fibre products) of operator spaces and study their behaviour with respect to different quantisations (minimal and maximal). We show examples of amalgamated direct sums of two L^{\infty}-spaces over a common subspace that are not minimal themselves, thus answering a question posed by Vern Paulsen.
