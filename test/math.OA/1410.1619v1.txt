This paper is devoted to local derivations on subalgebras on the algebra S(M, \tau) of all \tau-measurable operators affiliated with a von Neumann algebra M without abelian summands and with a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau. We prove that if \mathcal{A} is a solid \ast-subalgebra in S(M, \tau) such that p\in \mathcal{A} for all projection p\in M with finite trace, then every local derivation on the algebra \mathcal{A} is a derivation. This result is new even in the case standard subalgebras on the algebra B(H) of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H. We also apply our main theorem to the algebra S_0(M, \tau) of all \tau-compact operators affiliated with a semi-finite von Neumann algebra M and with a faithful normal semi-finite trace \tau.
