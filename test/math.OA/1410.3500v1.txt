Motivated by a random matrix theory model from wireless communications, we define random operator-valued matrices as the elements of L^{\infty-}(\Omega,{\mathcal F},{\mathbb P}) \otimes M_d({\mathcal A}) where (\Omega,{\mathcal F},{\mathbb P}) is a classical probability space and ({\mathcal A},\varphi) is a non-commutative probability space. A central limit theorem for the mean M_d(\mathbb{C})-valued moments of these random operator-valued matrices is derived. Also a numerical algorithm to compute the mean M_d({\mathbb C})-valued Cauchy transform of operator-valued semicircular mixtures is analyzed.
