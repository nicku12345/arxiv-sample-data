We prove that for every exact discrete group \Gamma, there is an intermediate C*-algebra between the reduced group C*-algebra and the intersection of the group von Neumann algebra and the uniform Roe algebra which is realized as the intersection of a decreasing sequence of isomorphs of the Cuntz algebra \mathcal{O}_2. In particular, when \Gamma has the AP (approximation property), the reduced group C*-algebra is realized in this way. We also study extensions of the reduced free group C*-algebras and show that any exact absorbing or unital absorbing extension of it by any stable separable nuclear C*-algebra is realized in this way.
