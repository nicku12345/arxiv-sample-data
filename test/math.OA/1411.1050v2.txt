Regular normalized B(W_1,W_2)-valued non-negative spectral measures introduced in \cite{Zalar2014} are in one-to-one correspondence with unital \ast-representations \rho:C(X,\mathbb{C})\otimes W_1 \rightarrow W_2, where X stands for a compact Hausdorff space and W_1, W_2 stand for von Neumann algebras. In this paper we generalize this result in two directions. The first is to \ast-representations of the form \rho:\mathcal{B}\otimes W_1\rightarrow W_2, where \mathcal{B} stands for a commutative \ast-algebra \mathcal{B}, and the second is to special (not necessarily bounded) \ast-representations of the form \rho:\mathcal{B}\otimes W_1\rightarrow \mathcal{L}^+(\mathcal{D}), where \mathcal{L}^+(\mathcal{D}) stands for a \ast-algebra of special linear operators on a dense subspace \mathcal{D} of a Hilbert space \mathcal{K}.
