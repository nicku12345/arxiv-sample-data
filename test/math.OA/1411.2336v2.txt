Let G be a compact group. For 1\leq p\leq\infty we introduce a class of Banach function algebras \mathrm{A}^p(G) on G which are the Fourier algebras in the case p=1, and for p=2 are certain algebras discovered in \cite{forrestss1}. In the case p\not=2 we find that \mathrm{A}^p(G)\cong \mathrm{A}^p(H) if and only if G and H are isomorphic compact groups. These algebras admit natural operator space structures, and also weighted versions, which we call p-Beurling-Fourier algebras. We study various amenability and operator amenability properties, Arens regularity and representability as operator algebras. For a connected Lie G and p>1, our techniques of estimation of when certain p-Beurling-Fourier algebras are operator algebras rely more on the fine structure of G, than in the case p=1. We also study restrictions to subgroups. In the case that G=SU(2), restrict to a torus and obtain some exotic algebras of Laurent series. We study amenability properties of these new algebras, as well.
