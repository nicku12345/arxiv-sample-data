We prove the existence of a linear isometric correspondence between the Banach space of all symmetric orthogonal forms on a JB^*-algebra \mathcal{J} and the Banach space of all purely Jordan generalized derivations from \mathcal{J} into \mathcal{J}^*. We also establish the existence of a similar linear isometric correspondence between the Banach spaces of all anti-symmetric orthogonal forms on \mathcal{J}, and of all Lie Jordan derivations from \mathcal{J} into \mathcal{J}^*.
