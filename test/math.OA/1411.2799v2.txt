Graph products for groups were defined by Green in her thesis as a generalization of both Cartesian and free products. In this paper we define the corresponding graph product for reduced and maximal C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras and quantum groups. We prove stability properties including permanence properties of II_1-factors, the Haagerup property, exactness and under suitable conditions the property of Rapid Decay for quantum groups.
