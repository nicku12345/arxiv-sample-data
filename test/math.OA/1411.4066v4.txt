We realize the Jiang-Su algebra, all UHF algebras, and the hyperfinite II_{1} factor as Fra\"iss\'e limits of suitable classes of structures. Moreover by means of Fra\"iss\'e theory we provide new examples of AF algebras with strong homogeneity properties. As a consequence of our analysis we deduce Ramsey-theoretic results about the class of full-matrix algebras.
