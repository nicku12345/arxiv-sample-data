We prove that every weak-local derivation on a C^*-algebra is continuous, and the same conclusion remains valid for weak^*-local derivations on von Neumann algebras. We further show that weak-local derivations on C^*-algebras and weak^*-local derivations on von Neumann algebras are derivations. We also study the connections between bilocal derivations and bilocal ^*-automorphism with our notions of extreme-strong-local derivations and automorphisms.
