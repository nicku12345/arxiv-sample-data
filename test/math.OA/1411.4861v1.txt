In this paper, we study operator algebraic properties of the reduced and von Neumann algebraic versions of the free wreath products \mathbb G \wr_* S_N^+, where \mathbb G is a compact matrix quantum group. Based on recent result on their corepresentation theory by Lemeux and Tarrago, we prove that \mathbb G \wr_* S_N^+ is of Kac type whenever \mathbb G is, and that the reduced version of \mathbb G \wr_* S_N^+ is simple with unique trace state whenever N \geq 8. Moreover, we prove that the reduced von Neumann algebra of \mathbb G \wr_* S_N^+ does not have property \Gamma.
