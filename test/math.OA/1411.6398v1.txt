A real seminormed involutive algebra is a real associative algebra {\mathcal A} endowed with an involutive antiautomorphism * and a submultiplicative seminorm p with p(a^*) =p(a) for a\in {\mathcal A}. Then {\mathop{\tt ball}\nolimits}({\mathcal A},p) := \{a \in {\mathcal A} \colon p(a) < 1\} is an involutive subsemigroup. For the case where {\mathcal A} is unital, our main result asserts that a function \phi \colon{\mathop{\tt ball}\nolimits}({\mathcal A},p) \to B(V), V a Hilbert space, is completely positive (defined suitably) if and only if it is positive definite and analytic for any locally convex topology for which {\mathop{\tt ball}\nolimits}({\mathcal A},p) is open. If \eta_{\mathcal A} \colon {\mathcal A} \to C^*({\mathcal A},p) is the enveloping C^*-algebra of ({\mathcal A},p) and e^{C^*({\mathcal A},p)} is the c_0-direct sum of the symmetric tensor powers S^n(C^*({\mathcal A},p)), then the above two properties are equivalent to the existence of a factorization \phi = \Phi \circ \Gamma, where \Phi \colon e^{C^*({\mathcal A},p)} \to B(V) is linear completely positive and \Gamma(a) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \eta_{\mathcal A}(a)^{\otimes n}. We also obtain a suitable generalization to non-unital algebras.   An important consequence of this result is a description of the unitary representations of {\rm U}({\mathcal A}) with bounded analytic extensions to {\mathop{\tt ball}\nolimits}({\mathcal A},p) in terms of representations of the C^*-algebra e^{C^*({\mathcal A},p)}.
