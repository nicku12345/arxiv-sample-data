To each real continuous function f there is an associated trace function on real symmetric matrices Tr f. The classical Klein lemma states that f is convex if and only if Tr f is convex. In this note we present an algebraic strengthening of this lemma for univariate polynomials f: Tr f is convex if and only if the noncommutative second directional derivative of f is a sum of hermitian squares and commutators in a free algebra. We also give a localized version of this result.
