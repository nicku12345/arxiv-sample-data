By means of Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} theory for metric structures developed by Ben Yaacov, we show that there exists a separable 1-exact operator system \mathbb{GS}---which we call the Gurarij operator system---of almost universal disposition. This means that whenever E\subset F are finite-dimensional 1-exact operator systems, \phi :E\rightarrow \mathbb{GS} is a unital complete isometry, and \varepsilon >0, there is a linear extension \widehat{\phi }:F\rightarrow \mathbb{GS} of \phi  such that ||\widehat{\phi }||_{cb}{}||\widehat{\phi }^{-1}||_{cb}\leq 1+\varepsilon . Such an operator system is unique up to complete order isomorphism. Furthermore it is nuclear, homogeneous, and any separable 1-exact operator system admits a complete order embedding into \mathbb{GS}. The space \mathbb{GS} can be regarded as the operator system analog of the Gurarij operator space \mathbb{NG} introduced by Oikhberg, which is in turn a canonical operator space structure on the Gurarij Banach space. We also show that the canonical \ast -homomorphism from the universal C*-algebra of \mathbb{GS} to the C*-envelope of \mathbb{GS} is a \ast -isomorphism. This implies that \mathbb{GS} does not admit any complete order embedding into a unital exact C*-algebra. In particular \mathbb{GS} is not completely order isomorphic to a unital C*-algebra. With similar methods we show that the Gurarij operator space \mathbb{NG} does not admit any completely isometric embedding into an exact C*-algebra, and in particular \mathbb{NG} is not completely isometric to a C*-algebra. This answers a question of Timur Oikhberg.
