The main result of the paper is the characterization of those locally compact quantum groups with projection, i.e. non-commutative analogs of semidirect products, which are extensions as defined by L. Vainerman and S. Vaes. It turns out that quantum groups with projection are usually not extensions. We discuss several examples including the quantum \mathrm{U}_q(2). The major tool used to obtain these results is the co-duality for coideals in algebras of functions on locally compact quantum groups and the concept of a normal coideal.
