The purpose of this paper is to study property (RD) for locally compact Hecke pairs. We discuss length functions on Hecke pairs and the growth of Hecke pairs. We establish an equivalence between property (RD) of locally compact groups and property (RD) of certain locally compact Hecke pairs. This allows us to transfer several important results concerning property (RD) of locally compact groups into our setting, and consequently to identify many classes of examples of locally compact Hecke pairs with property (RD). We also show that a reduced discrete Hecke pair (G,H) has (RD) if and only if its Schlichting completion \bar{G} has (RD). Then it follows that the relative unimodularity is a necessary condition for a discrete Hecke pair to possess property (RD).
