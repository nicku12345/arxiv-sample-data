In this paper we introduce the notion of multiplier of a Hilbert pro-C^{\ast }-bimodule and we investigate the structure of the multiplier bimodule of a Hilbert pro-C^{\ast}-bimodule. We also investigate the relationship between the crossed product A\times _{X}\mathbb{Z} of a pro-% C^{\ast }-algebra A by a Hilbert pro-C^{\ast }-bimodule X over A, the crossed product M(A)\times _{M(X)}\mathbb{Z} of the multiplier algebra M(A) of A by the multiplier bimodule M(X) of X and the multiplier algebra M(A\times _{X}\mathbb{Z}) of A\times _{X}\mathbb{Z}.
