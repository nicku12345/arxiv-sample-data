We describe the one-dimensional \v{C}eby\v{s}\"{e}v subspaces of a JBW^*-triple M, by showing that for a non-zero element x in M, \mathbb{C}x is a \v{C}eby\v{s}\"{e}v subspace of M if, and only if, x is a Brown-Pedersen quasi-invertible element in {M}. We study the \v{C}eby\v{s}\"{e}v JBW^*-subtriples of a JBW^*-triple M. We prove that, for each non-zero \v{C}eby\v{s}\"{e}v JBW^*-subtriple N of M, then exactly one of the following statements holds: (a) N is a rank one JBW^*-triple with dim(N)\geq 2 (i.e. a complex Hilbert space regarded as a type 1 Cartan factor). Moreover, N may be a closed subspace of arbitrary dimension and M may have arbitrary rank; (b) N= \mathbb{C} e, where e is a complete tripotent in M; (c) N and M have rank two, but N may have arbitrary dimension; (d) N has rank greater or equal than three and N=M.   We also provide new examples of \v{C}eby\v{s}\"{e}v subspaces of classic Banach spaces in connection with ternary rings of operators.
