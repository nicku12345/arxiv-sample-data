We show that the class of Banach algebras that can be isometrically represented on an L^p-space, for p\neq 2, is not closed under quotients. This answers a question asked by Le Merdy 20 years ago. Our methods are heavily reliant on our earlier study of Banach algebras generated by invertible isometries of L^p-spaces.
