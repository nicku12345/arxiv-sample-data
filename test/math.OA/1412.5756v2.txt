This paper presents categorical structures on classical measure spaces and quantum measure spaces in order to deal with canonical maps associated with conditional measures as morphisms. We extend the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem and the Gelfand duality theorem to an equivalence of categories between them. From this categorical viewpoint, we introduce a quantum version of conditional measures as a dual concept of the classical one.
