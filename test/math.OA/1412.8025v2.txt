In this paper we introduce a new class of non-amenable groups denoted by {\bf NC}_1 \cap {\bf Quot}(\mathcal C_{rss}) which give rise to \textit{prime} von Neumann algebras. This means that for every \Gamma \in {\bf NC}_1 \cap {\bf Quot}(\mathcal C_{rss}) its group von Neumann algebra L(\Gamma) cannot be decomposed as a tensor product of diffuse von Neumann algebras. We show {\bf NC}_1 \cap {\bf Quot}(\mathcal C_{rss}) is fairly large as it contains many examples of groups intensively studied in various areas of mathematics, notably: all infinite central quotients of pure surface braid groups; all mapping class groups of (punctured) surfaces of genus 0,1,2; most Torelli groups and Johnson kernels of (punctured) surfaces of genus 0,1,2; and, all groups hyperbolic relative to finite families of residually finite, exact, infinite, proper subgroups.
