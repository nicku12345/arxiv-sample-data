We construct a calculus for generalized \mathbf{SG} Fourier integral operators, extending known results to a broader class of symbols of \mathbf{SG} type. In particular, we do not require that the phase functions are homogeneous. We also prove the L^2(\mathbf{R}^{d})-boundedness of the generalized \mathbf{SG} Fourier integral operators having regular phase functions and amplitudes uniformly bounded on \mathbf{R}^{2d}.
