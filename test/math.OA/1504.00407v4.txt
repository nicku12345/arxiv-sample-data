Let S be a subsemigroup of a second countable locally compact group G, such that S^{-1}S=G. We consider the C^*-algebra C^*_\delta(S) generated by the operators of translation by all elements of S in L^2(S). We show that this algebra admits a comultiplication which turns it into a compact quantum semigroup. The same is proved for the von Neumann algebra VN(S) generated by C^*_\delta(S).
