A triple of commuting operators for which the closed tetrablock \overline{\mathbb E} is a spectral set is called a tetrablock contraction or an \mathbb E-contraction. The set \mathbb E is defined as \[ \mathbb E = \{ (x_1,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb C^3\,:\, 1-zx_1-wx_2+zwx_3\neq 0 \textup{ whenever } |z|\leq 1, |w|\leq 1 \}. \] We show that every \mathbb E-contraction can be uniquely written as a direct sum of an \mathbb E-unitary and a completely non-unitary \mathbb E-contraction. It is analogous to the canonical decomposition of a contraction operator into a unitary and a completely non-unitary contraction. We produce a concrete operator model for such a triple satisfying some conditions.
