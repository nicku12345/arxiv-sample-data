We examine a spectral sequence that is naturally associated with the Baum-Connes Conjecture with coefficients for \mathbb Z^n and also constitutes an instance of Kasparov's construction in his work on equivariant KK-theory. For k\leq n, we give a partial description of the k-th page differential of this spectral sequence, which takes into account the natural \mathbb Z^k-subactions. In the special case that the action is trivial in K-theory, the associated second page differential is given by a formula involving the second page differentials of the canonical \mathbb Z^2-subactions. For n=2, we give a concrete realisation of the second page differential in terms of Bott elements. We prove the existence of \mathbb Z^2-actions, whose associated second page differentials are non-trivial. One class of examples is given by certain outer \mathbb Z^2-actions on Kirchberg algebras, which act trivially on KK-theory. This relies on a classification result by Izumi and Matui. A second class of examples consists of certain pointwise inner \mathbb Z^2-actions. One instance is given as a natural action on the group \mathrm{C}^*-algebra of the discrete Heisenberg group H_3. We also compute the K-theory of the corresponding crossed product. Moreover, a general and concrete construction yields various examples of pointwise inner \mathbb Z^2-actions on amalgamated free product \mathrm{C}^*-algebras with non-trivial second page differentials. Among these, there are actions which are universal, in a suitable sense, for pointwise inner \mathbb Z^2-actions with non-trivial second page differentials. We also compute the K-theory of the crossed products associated with these universal \mathrm{C}^*-dynamical systems.
