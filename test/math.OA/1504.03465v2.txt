Let \mathcal{H}_d^{(t)} (t \geq -d, t>-3) be the reproducing kernel Hilbert space on the unit ball \mathbb{B}_d with kernel \[ k(z,w) = \frac{1}{(1-\langle z, w \rangle)^{d+t+1}} . \] We prove that if an ideal I \triangleleft \mathbb{C}[z_1, \ldots, z_d] (not necessarily homogeneous) has what we call the "approximate stable division property", then the closure of I in \mathcal{H}_d^{(t)} is p-essentially normal for all p>d. We then show that all quasi homogeneous ideals in two variables have the stable division property, and combine these two results to obtain a new proof of the fact that the closure of any quasi homogeneous ideal in \mathbb{C}[x,y] is p-essentially normal for p>2.
