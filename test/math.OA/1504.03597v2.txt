We show that, given a compact Hausdorff space \Omega, there is a compact group {\mathbb G} and a homeomorphic embedding of \Omega into {\mathbb G}, such that the restriction map {\rm A}({\mathbb G})\to C(\Omega) is a complete quotient map of operator spaces. In particular, this shows that there exist compact groups which contain infinite cb-Helson subsets, answering a question raised in [Choi--Samei, Proc. AMS 2013; cf. http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2953]. A negative result from the same paper is also improved.
