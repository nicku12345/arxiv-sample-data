We introduce the notion of accurate foundation sets and the accurate refinement property for right LCM semigroups. For right LCM semigroups with this property, we derive a more explicit presentation of the boundary quotient. In the context of algebraic dynamical systems, we also analyse finiteness properties of foundation sets which lead us to a very concrete presentation. Based on Starling's recent work, we provide sharp conditions on certain algebraic dynamical systems for pure infiniteness and simplicity of their boundary quotient.
