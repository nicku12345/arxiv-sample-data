We introduce the notion of a positive spectral measure on a \sigma-algebra, taking values in the positive projections on a Banach lattice. Such a measure generates a bounded positive representation of the bounded measurable functions. If X is a locally compact Hausdorff space, and \pi is a positive representation of C_0(X) on a KB-space, then \pi is the restriction to C_0(X) of such a representation generated by a unique regular positive spectral measure on the Borel \sigma-algebra of X. The relation between a positive representation of C_0(X) on a Banach lattice and -- if it exists -- a generating positive spectral measure on the Borel \sigma-algebra is further investigated; here and elsewhere phenomena occur that are specific for the ordered context.
