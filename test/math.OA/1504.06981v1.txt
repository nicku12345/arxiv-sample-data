We prove that the predual of any von Neumann algebra is 1-Plichko, i.e., it has a countably 1-norming Markushevich basis. This answers a question of the third author who proved the same for preduals of semifinite von Neumann algebras. As a corollary we obtain an easier proof of a result of U.~Haagerup that the predual of any von Neumann algebra enjoys the separable complementation property. We further prove that the self-adjoint part of the predual is 1-Plichko as well.
