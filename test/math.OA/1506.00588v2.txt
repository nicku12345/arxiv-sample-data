Using Popa's deformation/rigidity theory, we investigate prime decompositions of von Neumann algebras of the form L(\mathcal{R}) for countable probability measure preserving equivalence relations \mathcal{R}. We show that L(\mathcal{R}) is prime whenever \mathcal{R} is nonamenable, ergodic, and admits an unbounded 1-cocycle into a mixing orthogonal representation weakly contained in the regular representation. This is accomplished by constructing the \textit{Gaussian extension }\tilde{\mathcal{R}} of \mathcal{R} and subsequently an s-malleable deformation of the inclusion L(\mathcal{R}) \subset L(\tilde{\mathcal{R}}). We go on to note a general obstruction to unique prime factorization, and avoiding it, we prove a unique prime factorization result for products of the form L(\mathcal{R}_1) \otimes L(\mathcal{R}_2) \otimes \cdots \otimes L(\mathcal{R}_k). As a corollary, we get a unique factorization result in the equivalence relation setting for products of the form \mathcal{R}_1 \times \mathcal{R}_2 \times \cdots \times \mathcal{R}_k. We finish with an application to the measure equivalence of groups.
