We prove noncommutative martingale inequalities associated with convex functions. More precisely, we obtain \Phi-moment analogues of the noncommutative Burkholder inequalities and the noncommutative Rosenthal inequalities for any convex Orlicz function \Phi whose Matuzewska-Orlicz indices p_\Phi and q_\Phi are such that 1<p_\Phi\leq q_\Phi <2 or 2<p_\Phi \leq q_\Phi<\infty. These results generalize the noncommutative Burkholder/Rosenthal inequalities due to Junge and Xu.
