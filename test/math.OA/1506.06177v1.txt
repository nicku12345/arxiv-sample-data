We study some examples of minimal length curves in homogeneous spaces of B(H) under a left action of a unitary group. Recent results relate these curves with the existence of minimal (with respect to a quotient norm) anti-Hermitian operators Z in the tangent space of the starting point. We show minimal curves that are not of this type but nevertheless can be approximated uniformly by those.
