We characterise all Jordan triple product homomorphisms, that is, mappings \Phi satisfying  \Phi(ABA) = \Phi(A)\Phi(B)\Phi(A)  from the set of all Hermitian n \times n complex matrices to the field of complex numbers. Further we characterise all Jordan triple product homomorphisms from the field of complex or real numbers or the set of all nonnegative real numbers to the set of all Hermitian n \times n complex matrices.
