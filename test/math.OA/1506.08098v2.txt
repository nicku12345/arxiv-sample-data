Ott, Tomforde, and Willis proposed a useful compactification for one-sided shifts over infinite alphabets. Building from their idea we develop a notion of two-sided shift spaces over infinite alphabets, with an eye towards generalizing a result of Kitchens. As with the one-sided shifts over infinite alphabets our shift spaces are compact Hausdorff spaces but, in contrast to the one-sided setting, our shift map is continuous everywhere. We show that many of the classical results from symbolic dynamics are still true for our two-sided shift spaces. In particular, while for one-sided shifts the problem about whether or not any M-step shift is conjugate to an edge shift space is open, for two-sided shifts we can give a positive answer for this question.
