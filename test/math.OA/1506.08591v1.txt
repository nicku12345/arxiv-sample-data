We consider dynamical semigroups with unbounded Kossakowski-Lindblad-Davies generators which are related to evolution of an open system with a tuned repeated harmonic perturbation. Our main result is the proof of existence of uniquely determined minimal trace-preserving strongly continuous dynamical semigroups on the space of density matrices. The corresponding dual W *-dynamical system is shown to be unital quasi-free and completely positive automorphisms of the CCR-algebra. We also comment on the action of dynamical semigroups on quasi-free states.
