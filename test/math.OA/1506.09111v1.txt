We study some aspects of the functor of parabolic induction within the context of reduced group C*-algebras and related operator algebras. We explain how Frobenius reciprocity fits naturally within the context of operator modules, and examine the prospects for an operator algebraic formulation of Bernstein's reciprocity theorem (his second adjoint theorem).
