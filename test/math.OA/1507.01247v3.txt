We show that the Leavitt path algebras L_{2,\mathbb{Z}} and L_{2-,\mathbb{Z}} are not isomorphic as *-algebras. There are two key ingredients in the proof. One is a partial algebraic translation of Matsumoto and Matui's result on diagonal preserving isomorphisms of Cuntz--Krieger algebras. The other is a complete description of the projections in L_{\mathbb{Z}}(E) for E a finite graph. This description is based on a generalization, due to Chris Smith, of the description of the unitaries in L_{2,\mathbb{Z}} given by Brownlowe and the second named author. The techniques generalize to a slightly larger class of rings than just \mathbb{Z}.
