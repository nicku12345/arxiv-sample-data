It is known that, under strong combinatorial axioms, O_N\subset O_N^*\subset O_N^+ are the only orthogonal quantum groups. We prove here similar results for the noncommutative spheres S^{N-1}_\mathbb R\subset S^{N-1}_{\mathbb R,*}\subset S^{N-1}_{\mathbb R,+}, the noncommutative projective spaces P^{N-1}_\mathbb R\subset P^{N-1}_\mathbb C\subset P^{N-1}_+, and the projective orthogonal quantum groups PO_N\subset PO_N^*\subset PO_N^+.
