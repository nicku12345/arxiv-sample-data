Building on our previous work, we study the non-relative homology of quantum group convolution algebras. Our main result establishes the equivalence of amenability of a locally compact quantum group \mathbb{G} and 1-injectivity of L^{\infty}(\widehat{\mathbb{G}}) as an operator L^1(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})-module. In particular, a locally compact group G is amenable if and only if its group von Neumann algebra VN(G) is 1-injective as an operator module over the Fourier algebra A(G). As an application, we provide a decomposability result for completely bounded L^1(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})-module maps on L^{\infty}(\widehat{\mathbb{G}}), and give a simplified proof that amenable discrete quantum groups have co-amenable compact duals which avoids the use of modular theory and the Powers--St{\o}rmer inequality, suggesting that our homological techniques may yield a new approach to the open problem of duality between amenability and co-amenability.
