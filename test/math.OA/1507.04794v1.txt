We state a conjecture for the formulas of the depth 4 low-weight rotational eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues for the 3^G subfactor planar algebras. We prove the conjecture in the case when |G| is odd. To do so, we find an action of G on the reduced subfactor planar algebra at f^{(2)}, which is obtained from shading the planar algebra of the even half. We also show that this reduced subfactor planar algebra is a Yang-Baxter planar algebra.
