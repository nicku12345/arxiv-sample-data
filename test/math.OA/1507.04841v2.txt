We construct ergodic discrete probability measure preserving equivalence relations \cR that has no proper ergodic normal subequivalence relations and no proper ergodic finite-index subequivalence relations. We show that every treeable equivalence relation satisfying a mild ergodicity condition and cost >1 surjects onto every countable group with ergodic kernel. Lastly, we provide a simple characterization of normality for subequivalence relations and an algebraic description of the quotient.
