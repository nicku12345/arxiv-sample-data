In our paper "Essential normality, essential norms and hyperrigidity" we claimed that the restriction of the identity representation of a certain operator system (constructed from a polynomial ideal) has the unique extension property, however the justification we gave was insufficient. In this note we provide the required justification under some additional assumptions. Fortunately, homogeneous ideals that are "sufficiently non-trivial" are covered by these assumptions. This affects the section of our paper relating essential normality and hyperrigidity. We show here that Proposition 4.11 and Theorem 4.12 hold under the additional assumptions. We do not know if they hold in the generality considered in our paper.
