We prove that if a measure distal action \alpha of a countable group \Gamma is weakly contained in a strongly ergodic probability measure preserving action \beta of \Gamma, then \alpha is a factor of \beta. In particular, this applies when \alpha is a compact action. As a consequence, we show that the weak equivalence class of any strongly ergodic action completely remembers the weak isomorphism class of the maximal distal factor arising in the Furstenberg-Zimmer Structure Theorem.
