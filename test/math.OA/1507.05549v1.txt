In this paper, we study the relationship between operator space norm and operator space numerical radius on the matrix space \mathcal{M}_n(X), when X is a numerical radius operator space. Moreover, we establish several inequalities for operator space numerical radius and the maximal numerical radius norm of 2\times 2 operator matrices and their off-diagonal parts. One of our main results states that if (X, (O_n)) is an operator space, then \begin{align*} \frac12\max\big(W_{\max}(x_1+x_2)&, W_{\max}(x_1-x_2) \big)\\ &\le W_{\max}\Big(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & x_1 \\ x_2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\Big)\\ &\hspace{1.5cm}\le \frac12\left(W_{\max}(x_1+x_2)+ W_{\max}(x_1-x_2) \right) \end{align*} for all x_1, x_2\in \mathcal{M}_n(X).
