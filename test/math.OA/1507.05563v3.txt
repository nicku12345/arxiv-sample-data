We show an organized form of quantum de Finetti theorem for Boolean independence. We define a Boolean analogue of easy quantum groups for the categories of interval partitions, which is a family of sequences of quantum semigroups.   We construct the Haar states on those quantum semigroups. The proof of our de Finetti theorem is based on the analysis of the Haar states.
