We prove that there exist uncountably many separable II_1 factors whose ultrapowers (with respect to arbitrary ultrafilters) are non-isomorphic. In fact, we prove that the families of non-isomorphic II_1 factors originally introduced by McDuff \cite{MD69a,MD69b} are such examples. This entails the existence of a continuum of non-elementarily equivalent II_1 factors, thus settling a well-known open problem in the continuous model theory of operator algebras.
