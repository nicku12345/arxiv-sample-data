We continue the study of isomorphisms of tensor algebras associated to a C*-correspondences in the sense of Muhly and Solel. Inspired by by recent work of Davidson, Ramsey and Shalit, we solve isomorphism problems for tensor algebras arising from weighted partial dynamical systems. We provide complete bounded / isometric classification results for tensor algebras arising from weighted partial systems, both in terms of the C*-correspondences associated to them, and in terms of the original dynamics. We use this to show that the isometric isomorphism and algebraic / bounded isomorphism problems are two distinct problems, that require separate criteria to be solved. Our methods yield alternative proofs to classification results for Peters' semi-crossed product due to Davidson and Katsoulis and for multiplicity-free graph tensor algebras due to Katsoulis, Kribs and Solel.
