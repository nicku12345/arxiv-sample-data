A group is said to be C*-simple if its reduced C*-algebra is simple. We establish an intrinsic (group-theoretic) characterization of groups with this property. Specifically, we prove that a discrete group is C*-simple if and only if it has no non-trivial amenable uniformly recurrent subgroups. We further prove that a group is C*-simple if and only if it satisfies an averaging property considered by Powers.
