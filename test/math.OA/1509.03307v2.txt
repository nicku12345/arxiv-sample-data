\lambda-graph systems are labeled Bratteli diagram with shift operations. They present subshifts. Their matrix presentations are called symbolic matrix systems. We define skew products of \lambda-graph systems and study extensions of subshifts by finite groups. We prove that two canonical symbolic matrix systems are G-strong shift equivalent if and only if their presented subshifts are G-conjugate. G-equivalent classes of subshifts are classified by the cohomology classes of their associated skewing functions.
