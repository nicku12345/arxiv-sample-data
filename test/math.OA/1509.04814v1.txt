Let G be the symplectic group Sp_4 over a non Archimedean local field of any characteristic. It is proved in this paper that for p\in[1,4/3)\cup (4,\infty] neither the group G nor its lattices have the property of approximation by Schur multipliers on Schatten p class (AP_{pcb}^{Schur}) of Lafforgue and de la Salle. As a consequence, for any lattice \Gamma in G, the associated non-commutative L^p space L^p(L\Gamma) of its von Neumann algebra L(\Gamma) fails the operator space approximation property (OAP) and completely bounded approximation property (CBAP) for p\in[1,4/3)\cup (4,\infty]. Together with previous work [LdlS, HdL13a, HdL13b, dL], one can conclude that lattices in a higher rank algebraic group over any local field do not have the group approximation property (AP) of Haagerup and Kraus. It is also shown that on some lattice \Gamma in Sp_4 over some local field, the constant function 1 cannot be approximated by radial functions with bounded (not necessarily completely bounded) Fourier multiplier norms on C^*_r(\Gamma), nor on L^p(L\Gamma) for finite p>4.
