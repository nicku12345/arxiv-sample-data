We consider the tensorial Schur product R \circ^\otimes S = [r_{ij} \otimes s_{ij}] for R \in M_n(\mathcal{A}), S\in M_n(\mathcal{B}), with \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} unital C^*-algebras, verify that such a `tensorial Schur product' of positive operators is again positive, and then use this fact to prove (an apparently marginally more general version of) the classical result of Choi that a linear map \phi:M_n \to M_d is completely positive if and only if [\phi(E_{ij})] \in M_n(M_d)^+, where of course \{E_{ij}:1 \leq i,j \leq n\} denotes the usual system of matrix units in M_n (:= M_n(\mathbb{C})). We also discuss some other corollaries of the main result.
