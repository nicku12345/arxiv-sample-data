We study Toeplitz operators with separately radial and radial symbols on the weighted Bergman spaces on the unit ball. The unitary equivalence of such operators with multiplication operators on \ell^2 spaces was previously obtained by analytic methods elsewhere (see the references). We prove that the same constructions can be performed with a purely representation theoretic approach to obtain the same conclusions and formulas. However, our method is shorter, more elementary and more elucidating.
