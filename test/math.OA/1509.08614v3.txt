We prove that X^r follows an FID distribution if: (1) X follows a free Poisson distribution without an atom at 0 and r\in(-\infty,0]\cup[1,\infty); (2) X follows a free Poisson distribution with an atom at 0 and r\geq1; (3) X follows a mixture of some HCM distributions and |r|\geq1; (4) X follows some beta distributions and r is taken from some interval. In particular, if S is a standard semicircular element then |S|^r is freely infinitely divisible for r\in(-\infty,0]\cup[2,\infty). Also we consider the symmetrization of the above probability measures, and in particular show that |S|^r \,\text{sign}(S) is freely infinitely divisible for r\geq2. Therefore S^n is freely infinitely divisible for every n\in\mathbb N. The results on free Poisson and semicircular random variables have a good correspondence with classical ID properties of powers of gamma and normal random variables.
