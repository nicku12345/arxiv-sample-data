We construct spectral triples on C*-algebraic extensions of unital C*-algebras by stable ideals satisfying a certain Toeplitz type property using given spectral triples on the quotient and ideal. Our construction behaves well with respect to summability and produces new spectral quantum metric spaces out of given ones. Using our construction we find new spectral triples on the quantum 2- and 3-spheres giving a new perspective on these algebras in noncommutative geometry.
