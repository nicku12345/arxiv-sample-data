Given a finite alphabet \Lambda, and a not necessarily finite type subshift X\subseteq \Lambda^\infty, we introduce a partial action of the free group F(\Lambda) on a certain compactification \Omega_X of X, which we call the spectral partial action.   The space \Omega_X has already appeared in many papers in the subject, arising as the spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra usually denoted by {\cal D}_X. Since the descriptions given of \Omega_X in the literature are often somewhat terse and obscure, one of our main goals is to present a sensible model for it which allows for a detailed study of its structure, as well as of the spectral partial action, from various points of view, including topological freeness and minimality.   We then apply our results to study certain C*-algebras associated to X, introduced by Matsumoto and Carlsen. Most of the results we prove are already well known, but our proofs are hoped to be more natural and more in line with mainstream techniques used to treat similar C*-algebras. The clearer understanding of \Omega_X provided by our model in turn allows for a fine tuning of some of these results, including a necessary and sufficient condition for the minimality of the Carlsen-Matsumoto C*-algebra {\cal O}_X, generalizing a similar result of Thomsen.
