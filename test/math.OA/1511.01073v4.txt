Given a higher-rank graph \Lambda, we investigate the relationship between the cohomology of \Lambda and the cohomology of the associated groupoid G_\Lambda. We define an exact functor between the abelian category of right modules over a higher-rank graph \Lambda and the category of G_\Lambda-sheaves, where G_\Lambda is the path groupoid of \Lambda. We use this functor to construct compatible homomorphisms from both the cohomology of \Lambda with coefficients in a right \Lambda-module, and the continuous cocycle cohomology of G_\Lambda with values in the corresponding G_\Lambda-sheaf, into the sheaf cohomology of G_\Lambda.
