In this paper we study multiplication operators on Bergman spaces of higher dimensional domains and those von Neumann algebras induced by them. We will show an interplay of geometry, function theory and operator algebra. Local inverses, the Hartogs phenomena and L^2_a-removable sets will play an important role in the study.
