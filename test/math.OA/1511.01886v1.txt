In the present work we study elliptic operators on manifolds with singularities in the situation, when the manifold is endowed with an action of a discrete group G. As usual in elliptic theory, the Fredholm property of an operator is governed by the properties of its principal symbol. We show that the principal symbol in our situation is a pair, consisting of the symbol on the main stratum (interior symbol) and the symbol at the conical point (conormal symbol). Fredholm property of elliptic elements is obtained.
