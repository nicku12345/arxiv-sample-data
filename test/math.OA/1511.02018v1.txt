Utilizing the Birkhoff--James orthogonality, we present some characterizations of the norm-parallelism for elements of \mathbb{B}(\mathscr{H}) defined on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, elements of a Hilbert C^*-module over the C^*-algebra of compact operators and elements of an arbitrary C^*-algebra. We also consider the characterization of norm parallelism problem for operators on a finite dimensional Hilbert space when the operator norm is replaced by the Schatten p-norm. Some applications and generalizations are discussed for certain elements of a Hilbert C^*-module.
