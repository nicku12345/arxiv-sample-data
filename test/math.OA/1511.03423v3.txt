We show that for a locally compact group G, amongst a class which contains amenable and small invariant neighbourhood groups, that its Fourier algebra A(G) satisfies a completely bounded version Pisier's similarity property with similarity degree at most 2. Specifically, any completely bounded homomorphism \pi: A(G)\to B(H) admits an invertible S in B(H) for which \|S\|\|S^{-1}\|\leq ||\pi||_{cb}^2 and S^{-1}\pi(\cdot)S extends to a *-representation of the C^*-algebra C_0(G). This significantly improves some results due to Brannan and Samei (J. Funct. Anal. 259, 2010) and Brannan, Daws and Samei (M\"{u}nster J. Math 6, 2013). We also note that A(G) has completely bounded similarity degree 1 if and only if it is completely isomorphic to an operator algebra if and only if G is finite.
