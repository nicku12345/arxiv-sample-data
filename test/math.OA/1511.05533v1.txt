For any solvable Lie group whose exponential map \exp_G\colon{\mathfrak g}\to G is bijective, we prove that the real rank of C^*(G) is equal to \dim({\mathfrak g}/[{\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g}]). We also indicate a proof of a similar formula for the stable rank of C^*(G), as well as some estimates on the ideal generated by the projections in C^*(G).
