We extend the free monotone transport theorem of Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko to the case of infinite variables. As a first application, we provide a criterion for when mixed q-Gaussian algebras are isomorphic to L(\mathbb{F}_\infty); namely, when the structure array Q of a mixed q-Gaussian algebra has uniformly small entries that decay sufficiently rapidly. Here a mixed q-Gaussian algebra with structure array Q=(q_{ij})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}} is the von Neumann algebra generated by X_n^Q=l_n+l_n^*, n\in\mathbb{N} and (l_n) are the Fock space representations of the commutation relation l_i^*l_j-q_{ij}l_jl_i^*=\delta_{i=j}, i,j\in\mathbb{N}, -1<q_{ij}=q_{ji}<1.
