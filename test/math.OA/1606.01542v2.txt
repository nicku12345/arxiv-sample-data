In this paper, we introduce the notion of a scattered locally C^{\ast } -algebra and we give conditions for a locally C^{\ast }-algebra to be scattered. Given an action \alpha  of a locally compact group G on a scattered locally C^{\ast }-algebra A[\tau_{\Gamma }], it is natural to ask under what conditions the crossed product A[\tau_{\Gamma }]\times_{\alpha }G is also scattered. We obtain some results concerning this question.
