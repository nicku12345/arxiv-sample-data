We study the problem of determining when the reduced twisted group C*-algebra associated with a discrete group G is simple and/or has a unique tracial state, and present new sufficient conditions for this to hold. One of our main tools is a combinatorial property, that we call the relative Kleppner condition, which ensures that a quotient group G/H acts by freely acting automorphisms on the twisted group von Neumann algebra associated to a normal subgroup H. We apply our results to different types of groups, e.g. wreath products and Baumslag-Solitar groups.
