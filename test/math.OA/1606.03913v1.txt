Let A,\;B be the positive semidefinite matrices. A matrix version of the famous Powers-St{\o}rmer's inequality 2Tr(A^\alpha B^{1-\alpha})\geq Tr(A+B-|A-B|),\;\;\;0\leq\alpha\leq 1, was proven by Audenaert et. al. We establish a comparison of eigenvalues for the matrices A^\alpha B^{1-\alpha} and A+B-|A-B|, \; 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1, subsuming the Powers-St{\o}rmer's inequality. We also prove several related norm inequalities.
