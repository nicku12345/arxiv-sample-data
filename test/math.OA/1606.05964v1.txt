This paper concerns the study of regular Fourier hypergroups through multipliers of their associated Fourier algebras. We establish hypergroup analogues of well-known characterizations of group amenability, introduce a notion of weak amenability for hypergroups, and show that every discrete commutative hypergroup is weakly amenable with constant 1. Using similar techniques, we provide a sufficient condition for amenability of hypergroup Fourier algebras, which, as an immediate application, answers one direction of a conjecture of Azimifard--Samei--Spronk [J. Funct. Anal. 256(5) 1544-1564, 2009] on the amenability of ZL^1(G) for compact groups G. In the final section we consider Fourier algebras of hypergroups arising from compact quantum groups \mathbb{G}, and in particular, establish a completely isometric isomorphism with the center of the quantum group algebra for compact \mathbb{G} of Kac type.
