Given operator spaces V and W, let \widetilde{W} denote the opposite operator space structure on the same underlying Banach space. Although the identity map W\to \widetilde{W} is in general not completely bounded, we show that the identity map on V\otimes W extends to a contractive linear map V\widehat{\otimes} W \to V\otimes_{\min} \widetilde{W}, where \widehat{\otimes} and \otimes_{\rm min} denote the projective and injective tensor products of operator spaces. In future work, this will be applied to construct antisymmetric 2-cocycles on certain Fourier algebras.
