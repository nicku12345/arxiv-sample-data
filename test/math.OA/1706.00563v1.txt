We develop methods for computing graded K-theory of C*-algebras as defined in terms of Kasparov theory. We establish graded versions of Pimsner's six-term sequences for graded Hilbert bimodules whose left action is injective and by compacts, and a graded Pimsner-Voiculescu sequence. We introduce the notion of a twisted P-graph C*-algebra and establish connections with graded C*-algebras. Specifically, we show how a functor from a P-graph into the group of order two determines a grading of the associated C*-algebra. We apply our graded version of Pimsner's exact sequence to compute the graded K-theory of a graph C*-algebra carrying such a grading.
