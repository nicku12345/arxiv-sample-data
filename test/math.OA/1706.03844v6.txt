A subset of a discrete group G is called completely Sidon if its span in C^*(G) is completely isomorphic to the operator space version of the space \ell_1 (i.e. \ell_1 equipped with its maximal operator space structure). We recently proved a generalization to this context of Drury's classical union theorem for Sidon sets: completely Sidon sets are stable under finite unions. We give a different presentation of the proof emphasizing the "interpolation property" analogous to the one Drury discovered. In addition we prove the analogue of the Fatou-Zygmund property: any bounded Hermitian function on a symmetric completely Sidon set \Lambda\subset G\setminus\{1\} extends to a positive definite function on G. In the final section, we give a completely isomorphic characterization of the closed span C_\Lambda of a completely Sidon set in C^*(G): the dual (in the operator space sense) of C_\Lambda is exact iff \Lambda is completely Sidon. In particular, \Lambda is completely Sidon as soon as C_\Lambda is completely isomorphic (by an arbitrary isomorphism) to \ell_1(\Lambda) equipped with its maximal operator space structure.
