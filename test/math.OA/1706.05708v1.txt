Let \mathcal A be a unital C^*-algebra with the unit e. We consider the elements a\in \mathcal A which are Roberts orthogonal to the unit e. We obtain a characterization of this orthogonality in terms of the Davis--Wielandt shell of a and show that, for certain classes of elements of \mathcal A, the Roberts orthogonality of a and e is equivalent to the symmetry of the numerical range of a with respect to the origin.
