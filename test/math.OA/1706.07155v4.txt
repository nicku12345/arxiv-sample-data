We will characterize topologically conjugate two-sided topological Markov shifts (\bar{X}_A,\bar{\sigma}_A) in terms of the associated asymptotic Ruelle C^*-algebras {\mathcal{R}}_A with its commutative C^*-subalgebras C(\bar{X}_A) and the canonical circle actions. We will also show that extended Ruelle algebras {\widetilde{\mathcal{R}}}_A, which are purely infinite version of the asymptotic Ruelle algebras, with its commutative C^*-subalgebras C(\bar{X}_A) and the canonical torus actions \gamma^A are complete invariants for topological conjugacy of two-sided topological Markov shifts. We then have a computable topological conjugacy invariant, written in terms of the underlying matrix, of a two-sided topological Markov shift by using K-theory of the extended Ruelle algebra. The diagonal action of \gamma^A has a unique KMS-state on {\widetilde{\mathcal{R}}}_A, which is an extension of the Parry measure on \bar{X}_A.
