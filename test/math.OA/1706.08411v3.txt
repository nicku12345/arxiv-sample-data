We study restriction and extension properties for states on C^*-algebras with an eye towards hyperrigidity of operator systems. We use these ideas to provide supporting evidence for Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture. Prompted by various characterizations of hyperrigidity in terms of states, we examine unperforated pairs of self-adjoint subspaces in a C^*-algebra. The configuration of the subspaces forming an unperforated pair is in some sense compatible with the order structure of the ambient C^*-algebra. We prove that commuting pairs are unperforated, and obtain consequences for hyperrigidity. Finally, by exploiting recent advances in the tensor theory of operator systems, we show how the weak expectation property can serve as a flexible relaxation of the notion of unperforated pairs.
