In this article, we generalize to the case of measured quantum groupoids on a finite basis some important results concerning equivariant Kasparov theory for actions of locally compact quantum groups [S. Baaj and G. Skandalis, 1989, 1993]. To every pair (A,B) of C*-algebras continuously acted upon by a regular measured quantum groupoid on a finite basis \cal G, we associate a \cal G-equivariant Kasparov theory group {\sf KK}_{\cal G}(A,B). The Kasparov product generalizes to this setting. By applying recent results concerning actions of regular measured quantum groupoids on a finite basis [S. Baaj and J. C., 2015; J. C., 2017], we obtain two canonical homomorphisms J_{\cal G}:{\sf KK}_{\cal G}(A,B)\rightarrow{\sf KK}_{\widehat{\cal G}}(A\rtimes{\cal G},B\rtimes{\cal G}) and J_{\widehat{\cal G}}:{\sf KK}_{\widehat{\cal G}}(A,B)\rightarrow{\sf KK}_{\cal G}(A\rtimes\widehat{\cal G},B\rtimes\widehat{\cal G}) inverse of each other through the Morita equivalence coming from a version of the Takesaki-Takai duality theorem [S. Baaj and J. C., 2015; J. C., 2017]. We investigate in detail the case of colinking measured quantum groupoids. In particular, if \mathbb{G}_1 and \mathbb{G}_2 are two monoidally equivalent regular locally compact quantum groups, we obtain a new proof of the canonical equivalence of the associated equivariant Kasparov categories [S. Baaj and J. C., 2015].
