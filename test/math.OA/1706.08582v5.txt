For 1<p<\infty, we prove (i) a version of Voiculescu's absorption theorem for operators on l^{p}, (ii) that \mathrm{Ext}_{\sim,s}(\mathcal{A},K(l^{p})) is a group for certain Banach algebra \mathcal{A}, and (iii) homotopy invariance of \mathrm{Ext}_{\sim,s}(\mathcal{A},K(l^{p}))^{-1} in \mathcal{A} for separable Banach algebra \mathcal{A} that is isomorphic to a subalgebra of B(l^{p}).
