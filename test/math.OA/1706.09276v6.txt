We study flows on C*-algebras with the Rokhlin property. We show that every Kirchberg algebra carries a unique Rokhlin flow up to cocycle conjugacy, which confirms a long-standing conjecture of Kishimoto. We moreover present a classification theory for Rokhlin flows on C*-algebras satisfying certain technical properties, which hold for many C*-algebras covered by the Elliott program. As a consequence, we obtain the following further classification theorems for Rokhlin flows. Firstly, we extend the statement of Kishimoto's conjecture to the non-simple case: Up to cocycle conjugacy, a Rokhlin flow on a separable, nuclear, strongly purely infinite C*-algebra is uniquely determined by its induced action on the prime ideal space. Secondly, we give a complete classification of Rokhlin flows on simple classifiable KK-contractible C*-algebras: Two Rokhlin flows on such a C*-algebra are cocycle conjugate if and only if their induced actions on the cone of lower-semicontinuous traces are affinely conjugate.
