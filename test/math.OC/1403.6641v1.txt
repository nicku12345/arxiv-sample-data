We propose a new approach to model electrical machines based on energy considerations and construction symmetries of the motor. We detail the approach on the Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor and show that it can be extended to Synchronous Reluctance Motor and Induction Motor. Thanks to this approach we recover the usual models without any tedious computation. We also consider effects due to non-sinusoidal windings or saturation and provide experimental data.
