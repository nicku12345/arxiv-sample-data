The "Habitual domain" (HD) approach and the "Variational rationality" (VR) approach belong to the same strongly interdisciplinary and very dispersed area of research: human stability and change dynamics (see Soubeyran, 2009, 2010, for an extended survey), including physiological, physical, psychological and strategic aspects, in Psychology, Economics, Management Sciences, Decision theory, Game theory, Sociology, Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence,.... These two approaches are complementary. They have strong similarities and strong differences. They focus attention on both similar and different stay and change problems, using different concepts and different mathematical tools. When they use similar concepts (a lot), they often have different meaning. We can compare them with respect to the problems and topics they consider, the behavioral principles they use, the concepts they modelize, the mathematical tools they use, and their results.
