We introduce a novel kind of robustness in linear programming. A solution x* is called robust optimal if for all realizations of objective functions coefficients and constraint matrix entries from given interval domains there are appropriate choices of the right-hand side entries from their interval domains such that x* remains optimal. we propose a method to check for robustness of a given point, and also recommend how a suitable candidate can be found. We also discuss topological properties of the robust optimal solution set. We illustrate applicability of our concept in a transportation problem.
