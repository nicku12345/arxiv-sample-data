The paper addresses the problem of optimization of a guaranteed (worst case) result for a control system driven by a controlling side in presence of a dynamical disturbance. The disturbances as functions of time are subject to functional constraints belonging to a given family of constraints. The latter family is known to the controlling side that does not observe the disturbance and uses full-memory strategies to form the control actions. The study is focused on the case where disturbance varies in open-loop disturbances chosen in advance and the case where the disturbances are restricted to a L_2--compact set fixed in advance but unknown to the controlling side. In these cases it is shown that the optimal guaranteed result is non-improvable in the sense that it coincides with that obtained in the class of quasi-strategies -- nonantisipatory transformations of disturbances into controls. An \varepsilon--optimal full-memory strategy is constructed. An illustrative nonlinear example is given.
