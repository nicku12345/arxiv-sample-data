We introduce some sparse grids interpolations used in Semi-Lagrangian schemes for linear and fully non-linear diffusion Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations arising in stochastic control. We prove that the method introduced converges toward the viscosity solution of the problem and we show that some potentially high order schemes can be efficiently implemented. Numerical test in dimension 2 to 5 are achieved and show that deterministic methods can be used efficiently in stochastic control in moderate dimension.
