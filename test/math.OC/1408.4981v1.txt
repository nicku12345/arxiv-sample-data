We consider the problem of distributing two conducting materials with a prescribed volume ratio in a given domain so as to minimize the first eigenvalue of an elliptic operator with Dirichlet conditions. The gap between the two conductivities is assumed to be small (low contrast regime). For any geometrical configuration of the mixture, we provide a complete asymptotic expansion of the first eigenvalue. We then consider a relaxation approach to minimize the second order approximation with respect to the mixture. We present numerical simulations in dimensions two and three.
