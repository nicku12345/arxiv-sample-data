We consider the problem of global stability of nonlinear sampled-data systems. Sampled-data systems are a form of hybrid model which arises when discrete measurements and updates are used to control continuous-time plants. In this paper, we use a recently introduced Lyapunov approach to derive stability conditions for both the case of fixed sampling period (synchronous) and the case of a time-varying sampling period (asynchronous). This approach requires the existence of a Lyapunov function which decreases over each sampling interval. To enforce this constraint, we use a form of slack variable which exists over the sampling period, may depend on the sampling period, and allows the Lyapunov function to be temporarily increasing. The resulting conditions are enforced using a new method of convex optimization of polynomial variables known as Sum-of-Squares.We use several numerical examples to illustrate this approach.
