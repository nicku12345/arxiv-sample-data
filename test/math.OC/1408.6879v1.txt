This paper addresses the problem of static output feedback (SOF) stabilization for discrete-time LTI systems. We approach this problem using the recently developed periodically time-varying memory state-feedback controller (PTVMSFC) design scheme. A bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) condition which uses a pre-designed PTVMSFC is developed to design the periodically time-varying memory SOF controller (PTVMSOFC). The BMI condition can be solved by using BMI solvers. Alternatively, we can apply two-steps and iterative linear matrix inequality algorithms that alternate between the PTVMSFC and PTVMSOFC designs. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the proposed methods.
