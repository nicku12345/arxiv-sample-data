In this paper, we study the problem of control of discrete-time linear time varying systems over uncertain channels. The uncertainty in the channels is modeled as a stochastic random variable. We use exponential mean square stability of the closed-loop system as a stability criterion. We show that fundamental limitations arise for the mean square exponential stabilization for the closed-loop system expressed in terms of statistics of channel uncertainty and the positive Lyapunov exponent of the open-loop uncontrolled system. Our results generalize the existing results known in the case of linear time invariant systems, where Lyapunov exponents are shown to emerge as the generalization of eigenvalues from linear time invariant systems to linear time varying systems. Simulation results are presented to verify the main results of this paper.
