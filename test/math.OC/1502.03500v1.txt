An event-triggered control technique for consensus of multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics is presented. This paper extends previous work to consider agents that are connected using directed graphs. Additionally, the approach shown here provides asymptotic consensus with guaranteed positive inter-event time intervals. This event-triggered control method is also used in the case where communication delays are present. For the communication delay case we also show that the agents achieve consensus asymptotically and that, for every agent, the time intervals between consecutive transmissions is lower-bounded by a positive constant.
