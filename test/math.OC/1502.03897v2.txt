Let E be a real vector space with dual space E^* and let C\subset E be a convex subset with more than one point. Let f : C\to\mathbb{R} be a function satisfying a mild stability property at 'flat' points of the (relative) boundary of C. We show that f is convex if and only if for some linear form c^* on E not constant on C, the function f+\lambda c^* is quasiconvex for all \lambda\in\mathbb{R}.
