In a Hilbert setting, we introduce a new dynamical system and associated algorithms for solving monotone inclusions by rapid methods.   Given a maximal monotone operator A, the evolution is governed by the time dependent operator I -(I + \lambda(t) {A})^{-1}, where the positive control parameter \lambda(t) tends to infinity as t \to + \infty. The tuning of  \lambda (\cdot)  is done in a closed-loop way, by resolution of the algebraic equation \lambda \norm{(I + \lambda {A})^{-1}x -x}=\theta, where \theta  is a positive given constant. The existence and uniqueness of a strong global solution for the Cauchy problem follows from Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem. We prove the weak convergence of the trajectories to equilibria, and superlinear convergence under an error bound condition. When A =\partial f is the subdifferential of a closed convex function f, we show a \bigo(1/t^2) convergence property of f(x(t)) to the infimal value of the problem. Then, we introduce proximal-like algorithms which can be obtained by time discretization of the continuous dynamic, and which share the same fast convergence properties. As distinctive features, we allow a relative error tolerance for the solution of the proximal subproblem similar to the ones proposed in ~\cite{So-Sv1, So-Sv2}, and a large step condition, as proposed in~\cite{MS1,MS2}. For general convex minimization problems, the complexity is \bigo(1/n^2). In the regular case, we show the global quadratic convergence of an associated proximal-Newton method.
