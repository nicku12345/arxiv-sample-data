We study the time optimal control problem for differential inclusions with a general closed target. We first give the representation of the proximal horizontal subgradients of the minimum time function \mathcal{T} and then, together with the representation of the proximal subgradients, we obtain some relationships between the normal cones to the sublevel of \mathcal{T} and the normal cones to its epigraph. The relationships allow us to get the propagation of the proximal subdifferential as well as of the proximal horizontal subdifferential of \mathcal{T} along optimal trajectories. Finally, we show, under suitable assumptions, that the epigraph of \mathcal{T} is \varphi-convex near the target. This is the first nonlinear \varphi-convexity result valid in any dimension.
