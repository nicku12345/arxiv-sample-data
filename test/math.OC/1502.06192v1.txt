In this paper, we revisit the augmented Lagrangian method for a class of nonsmooth convex optimization. We present the Lagrange optimality system of the augmented Lagrangian associated with the problems, and establish its connections with the standard optimality condition and the saddle point condition of the augmented Lagrangian, which provides a powerful tool for developing numerical algorithms. We apply a linear Newton method to the Lagrange optimality system to obtain a novel algorithm applicable to a variety of nonsmooth convex optimization problems arising in practical applications. Under suitable conditions, we prove the nonsingularity of the Newton system and the local convergence of the algorithm.
