In this paper we design and analyze algorithms for asynchronously solving linear programs using nonlinear signal processing structures. In particular, we discuss a general procedure for generating these structures such that a fixed-point of the structure is within a change of basis the minimizer of an associated linear program. We discuss methods for organizing the computation into distributed implementations and provide a treatment of convergence. The presented algorithms are accompanied by numerical simulations of the Chebyshev center and basis pursuit problems.
