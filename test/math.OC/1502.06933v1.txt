The recently introduced second order total generalised variation functional \mathrm{TGV}_{\beta,\alpha}^{2} has been a successful regulariser for image processing purposes. Its definition involves two positive parameters \alpha and \beta whose values determine the amount and the quality of the regularisation. In this paper we report on the behaviour of \mathrm{TGV}_{\beta,\alpha}^{2} in the cases where the parameters \alpha, \beta as well as their ratio \beta/\alpha becomes very large or very small. Among others, we prove that for sufficiently symmetric two dimensional data and large ratio \beta/\alpha, \mathrm{TGV}_{\beta,\alpha}^{2} regularisation coincides with total variation (\mathrm{TV}) regularisation.
