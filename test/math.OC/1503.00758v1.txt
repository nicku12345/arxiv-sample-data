Lagrangian particle formulations of the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping algorithm (LDDMM) only allow for the study of a single shape. In this paper, we introduce and discuss both a theoretical and practical setting for the simultaneous study of multiple shapes that are either stitched to one another or slide along a submanifold. The method is described within the optimal control formalism, and optimality conditions are given, together with the equations that are needed to implement augmented Lagrangian methods. Experimental results are provided for stitched and sliding surfaces.
