We employ a natural method from the perspective of the optimal stopping theory to analyze entry-exit decisions with implementation delay of a project, and provide closed expressions for optimal entry decision times, optimal exit decision times and the maximal expected present value from the project. The results in conventional research were obtained under the restriction that the sum of the entry cost and the exit cost is nonnegative. In practice, we usually meet this sum is negative, so it is necessary to remove the restriction. If the sum is negative, there may exist two price triggers of entry decision, which does not happen when the sum is nonnegative, and it is not optimal to enter and then immediately exit the project even though it is an arbitrage opportunity.
