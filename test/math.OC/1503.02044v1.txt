This paper introduces a novel variational approach for image compression motivated by recent PDE-based approaches combining edge detection and Laplacian inpainting. The essential feature is to encode the image via a sparse vector field, ideally concentrating on a set of measure zero. An equivalent reformulation of the compression approach leads to a variational model resembling the ROF-model for image denoising, hence we further study the properties of the effective regularization functional introduced by the novel approach and discuss similarities to TV and TGV functionals. Moreover we computationally investigate the behaviour of the model with sparse vector fields for compression in particular for high resolution images and give an outlook towards denoising.
