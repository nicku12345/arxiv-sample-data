Potential vulnerabilities in a power grid can be exposed by identifying those transmission lines on which attacks (in the form of interference with their transmission capabilities) causes maximum disruption to the grid. In this study, we model the grid by (nonlinear) AC power flow equations, and assume that attacks take the form of increased impedance along transmission lines. We quantify disruption in several different ways, including (a) overall deviation of the voltages at the buses from 1.0 per unit (p.u.), and (b) the minimal amount of load that must be shed in order to restore the grid to stable operation. We describe optimization formulations of the problem of finding the most disruptive attack, which are either nonlinear programing problems or nonlinear bilevel optimization problems, and describe customized algorithms for solving these problems. Experimental results on the IEEE 118-Bus system and a Polish 2383-Bus system are presented.
