It is preliminarily known that Aedes mosquitoes are very close to humans and their dwellings, also give rises to a broad spectrum of diseases: dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya. In this paper, we explore a multi-age-class model for mosquito population secondarily classified into indoor-outdoor dynamics. We accentuate a novel design for the model in which periodicity of the affecting time-varying environmental condition is taken into account. Application of the optimal control with collocated measure as apposed to the widely-used prototypic smooth time-continuous measure is also considered. Using two approaches: least-square and maximum likelihood, we estimate several involving undetermined parameters. We analyze the model enforceability to biological point of view such as existence, uniqueness, positivity and boundedness of solution trajectory, also existence and stability of (non)trivial periodic solution(s) by means of the basic mosquito offspring number. Some numerical tests are brought along at the rest of the paper as a compact realistic visualization of the model.
