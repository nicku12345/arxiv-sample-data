In this paper, we consider a recursive estimation problem for linear regression where the signal to be estimated admits a sparse representation and measurement samples are only sequentially available. We propose a convergent parallel estimation scheme that consists in solving a sequence of \ell_{1}-regularized least-square problems approximately. The proposed scheme is novel in three aspects: i) all elements of the unknown vector variable are updated in parallel at each time instance, and convergence speed is much faster than state-of-the-art schemes which update the elements sequentially; ii) both the update direction and stepsize of each element have simple closed-form expressions, so the algorithm is suitable for online (real-time) implementation; and iii) the stepsize is designed to accelerate the convergence but it does not suffer from the common trouble of parameter tuning in literature. Both centralized and distributed implementation schemes are discussed. The attractive features of the proposed algorithm are also numerically consolidated.
