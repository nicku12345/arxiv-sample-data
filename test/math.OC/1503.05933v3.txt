Reachability analysis is important for studying optimal control problems and differential games, which are powerful theoretical tools for analyzing and modeling many practical problems in robotics, aircraft control, among other application areas. In reachability analysis, one is interested in computing the reachable set, defined as the set of states from which there exists a control, despite the worst disturbance, that can drive the system into a set of target states. The target states can be used to model either unsafe or desirable configurations, depending on the application. Many Hamilton-Jacobi formulations allow the computation of reachable sets; however, due to the exponential complexity scaling in computation time and space, problems involving approximately 5 dimensions become intractable. A number of methods that compute an approximate solution exist in the literature, but these methods trade off complexity for optimality. In this paper, we eliminate complexity-optimality trade-offs for time-invariant decoupled systems using a decoupled Hamilton-Jacobi formulation that enables the exact reconstruction of high dimensional solutions via low dimensional solutions of the decoupled subsystems. Our formulation is compatible with existing numerical tools, and we show the accuracy, computation benefits, and an application of our novel approach using two numerical examples.
