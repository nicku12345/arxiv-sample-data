In this paper, we present distributed controllers for sharing primary and secondary frequency control reserves for asynchronous AC transmission systems, which are connected through a multi-terminal HVDC grid. By using Lyapunov arguments, the equilibria of the closed-loop system are shown to be globally asymptotically stable. We quantify the static errors of the voltages and frequencies, and give upper bounds for these errors. It is also shown that the controllers have the property of power sharing, i.e., primary and secondary frequency control reserves are shared fairly amongst the AC systems. The proposed controllers are applied to a high-order dynamic model of of a power system consisting of asynchronous AC grids connected through a six-terminal HVDC grid.
