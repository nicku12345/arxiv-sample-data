In this paper, we discuss a new general formulation of fractional optimal control problems whose performance index is in the fractional integral form and the dynamics are given by a set of fractional differential equations in the Caputo sense. We use a new approach to prove necessary conditions of optimality in the form of Pontryagin maximum principle for fractional nonlinear optimal control problems. Moreover, a new method based on a generalization of the Mittag-Leffler function is used to solving this class of fractional optimal control problems. A simple example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our main result.
