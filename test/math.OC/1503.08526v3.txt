The collective decision-making exhibited by animal groups provides enormous inspiration for multi-agent control system design as it embodies several features that are desirable in engineered networks, including robustness and adaptability, low computational effort, and an intrinsically decentralized architecture. However, many of the mechanistic models for collective decision-making are described at the population-level abstraction and are challenging to implement in an engineered system. We develop simple and easy-to-implement models of opinion dynamics that realize the empirically observed collective decision-making behavior as well as the behavior predicted by existing models of animal groups. Using methods from Lyapunov analysis, singularity theory, and monotone dynamical systems, we rigorously investigate the steady-state decision-making behavior of our models.
