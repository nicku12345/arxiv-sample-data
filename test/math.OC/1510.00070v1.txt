We address H-infinity structured static state feedback and give a simple form for an optimal control law applicable to linear time invariant systems with symmetric and Hurwitz state matrix. More specifically, the control law as well as the minimal value of the norm can be expressed in the matrices of the system's state space representation, given separate cost on state and control input. Thus, the control law is transparent, easy to synthesize and scalable. Furthermore, if the plant possess a compatible sparsity pattern it is also distributed. Examples of such sparsity patterns are included. Furthermore, we give an extension of the optimal control law that incorporate coordination among subsystems. We demonstrate by a numerical example that the derived optimal controller is equal in performance to an optimal controller derived by the riccati equation approach.
