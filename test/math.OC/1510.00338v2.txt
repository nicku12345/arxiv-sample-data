We propose a method to "create" a new measurement output by exciting the system with a high-frequency oscillation. This new "virtual" measurement may be useful to facilitate the design of a suitable control law. The approach is especially interesting when the observability from the actual output degenerates at a steady-state regime of interest. The proposed method is based on second-order averaging and is illustrated by simulations on a simple third-order system.
