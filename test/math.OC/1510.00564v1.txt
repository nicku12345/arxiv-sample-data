We address robustness issues of self-triggered sampling with respect to model uncertainties, and propose a robust self-triggered sampling method. The approach is compared with existing methods in terms of sampling conservativeness and closed-loop system performance. The proposed method aims at fulfilling the gap between the event and the self-triggered sampling paradigms for what concerns robustness with respect to model uncertainties, and it generalizes most of the existing self-triggered samplers implemented up to now.
