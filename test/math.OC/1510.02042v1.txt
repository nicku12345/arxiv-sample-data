We prove the following theorem: Let Q be an isolated chain control set of a control-affine system on a smooth compact manifold M. If Q is uniformly hyperbolic without center bundle, then the lift of Q to the extended state space U x M, where U is the space of control functions, is a graph over U. In other words, for every control u in U there is a unique x in Q such that the corresponding state trajectory phi(t,x,u) evolves in Q.
