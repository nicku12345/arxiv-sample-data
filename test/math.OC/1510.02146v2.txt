In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm, called Directed-Distributed Gradient Descent (D-DGD), to solve multi-agent optimization problems over directed graphs. Existing algorithms mostly deal with similar problems under the assumption of undirected networks, i.e., requiring the weight matrices to be doubly-stochastic. The row-stochasticity of the weight matrix guarantees that all agents reach consensus, while the column-stochasticity ensures that each agent's local gradient contributes equally to the global objective. In a directed graph, however, it may not be possible to construct a doubly-stochastic weight matrix in a distributed manner. We overcome this difficulty by augmenting an additional variable for each agent to record the change in the state evolution. In each iteration, the algorithm simultaneously constructs a row-stochastic matrix and a column-stochastic matrix instead of only a doubly-stochastic matrix. The convergence of the new weight matrix, depending on the row-stochastic and column-stochastic matrices, ensures agents to reach both consensus and optimality. The analysis shows that the proposed algorithm converges at a rate of O(\frac{\ln k}{\sqrt{k}}), where k is the number of iterations.
