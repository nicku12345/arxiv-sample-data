Many steady-state problems in power systems, including rectangular power-voltage formulations of optimal power flows in the alternating-current model (ACOPF), can be cast as polynomial optimisation problems (POP). For a POP, one can derive strong convex relaxations, or rather hierarchies of ever stronger, but ever larger relaxations. We study means of switching from solving the convex relaxation to Newton method working on a non-convex Lagrangian of the POP.
