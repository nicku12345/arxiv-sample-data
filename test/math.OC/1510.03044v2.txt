Distributed cooperative droop control consisting of the primary decentralized droop control and the {secondary} distributed correction control is studied in this paper, which aims to achieve an exact current sharing between generators, worked in the voltage control mode, of DC microgrids. For the DC microgrids with the distributed cooperative droop control, the dynamic stability has not been well investigated although its steady performance has been widely reported. This paper focuses on the stability problem and shows it is equivalent to the semistability problem of a class of second-order matrix systems. Some further sufficient conditions as well followed. The steady state is analyzed deeply for some special cases. A DC microgrid of three nodes is simulated on the Matlab/Simulink platform to illustrate the efficacy of analytic results.
