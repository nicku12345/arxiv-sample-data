The increasing integration of large-scale volatile and uncertain wind generation has brought great challenges to power system operations. In this paper, a risk-based admissibility assessment approach is proposed to quantitatively evaluate how much wind generation can be accommodated by the bulk power system under a given unit commitment (UC) strategy. Firstly, the operational risk brought by the variation and uncertainty of wind generation is developed as an admissibility measure of wind generation. Then its linear approximation is derived for practical implementation. Furthermore, a risk-minimization model is established to mathematically characterize the admissible region of wind generation. This model can be solved effectively by a modified column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm. Simulations on the IEEE 9-bus system and the real Guangdong power grid demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology.
