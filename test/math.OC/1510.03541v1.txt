- We discuss the approximation of distributed null controls for partial differential equations. The main purpose is to determine an approximation of controls that drives the solution from a prescribed initial state at the initial time to the zero target at a prescribed final time. As a non trivial example, we mainly focus on the Stokes system for which the existence of square-integrable controls have been obtained in [Fursikov \& Imanuvilov, Controllability of Evolution Equations, 1996]) via Carleman type estimates. We introduce a least-squares formulation of the controllability problem, and we show that it allows the construction of strong convergent sequences of functions toward null controls for the Stokes system. The approach consists first in introducing a class of functions satisfying a priori the boundary conditions in space and time-in particular the null controllability condition at time T-, and then finding among this class one element satisfying the system. This second step is done by minimizing a quadratic functional, among the admissible corrector functions of the Stokes system. We also discuss briefly the direct problem for the steady Navier-Stokes system. The method does not make use of any duality arguments and therefore avoid the ill-posedness of dual methods, when parabolic type equation are considered.
