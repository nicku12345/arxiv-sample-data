We propose a new central synergistic hybrid approach for global exponential stabilization on the Special Orthogonal group SO(3). We introduce a new switching concept relying on a central family of (possibly) non-differentiable potential functions that enjoy (as well as their gradients) the following properties: 1) being quadratic with respect to the Euclidean attitude distance, and 2) being synergistic with respect to the gradient's singular and/or critical points. The proposed approach is used to solve the attitude tracking problem, leading to global exponential stability results.
