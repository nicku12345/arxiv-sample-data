In this paper, for any homogeneous system of agents with linear continuous time dynamics, we formulate an optimal control problem. In this problem a convex cost functional of the control signals of the agents shall be minimized, while the outputs of the agents shall coincide at some given finite time. This is an instance of the rendezvous or finite time consensus problem. We solve this problem without any constraints on the communication topology and provide a solution as an explicit feedback control law for the case when the dynamics of the agents is output controllable. It turns out that the communication graph topology induced by the solution is complete. Based on this solution for the finite time consensus problem, we provide a solution to the case of infinite time horizon. Furthermore, we investigate under what circumstances it is possible to express the controller as a feedback control law of the output instead of the states.
