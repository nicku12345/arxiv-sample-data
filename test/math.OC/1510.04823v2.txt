Bensolve is an open source implementation of Benson's algorithm and its dual variant. Both algorithms compute primal and dual solutions of vector linear programs (VLP), which include the subclass of multiple objective linear programs (MOLP). The recent version of Bensolve can treat arbitrary vector linear programs whose upper image does not contain lines. This article surveys the theoretical background of the implementation. In particular, the role of VLP duality for the implementation is pointed out. Some numerical examples are provided.
