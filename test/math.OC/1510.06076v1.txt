In this paper, we derive optimality conditions (Chebyshev approximation) for multivariate functions. The theory of Chebyshev (uniform) approximation for univariate functions is very elegant. The optimality conditions are based on the notion of alternance (maximal deviation points with alternating deviation signs). It is not very straightforward, however, how to extend the notion of alternance to the case of multivariate functions. There have been several attempts to extend the theory of Chebyshev approximation to the case of multivariate functions. We propose an alternative approach, which is based on the notion of convexity and nonsmooth analysis.
