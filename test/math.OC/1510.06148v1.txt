This paper considers a networked system with a finite number of users and supposes that each user tries to minimize its own private objective function over its own private constraint set. It is assumed that each user's constraint set can be expressed as a fixed point set of a certain quasi-nonexpansive mapping. This enables us to consider the case in which the projection onto the constraint set cannot be computed efficiently. This paper proposes two methods for solving the problem of minimizing the sum of their nondifferentiable, convex objective functions over the intersection of their fixed point sets of quasi-nonexpansive mappings in a real Hilbert space. One method is a parallel subgradient method that can be implemented under the assumption that each user can communicate with other users. The other is an incremental subgradient method that can be implemented under the assumption that each user can communicate with its neighbors. Investigation of the two methods' convergence properties for a constant step size reveals that, with a small constant step size, they approximate a solution to the problem. Consideration of the case in which the step-size sequence is diminishing demonstrates that the sequence generated by each of the two methods strongly converges to the solution to the problem under certain assumptions. Convergence rate analysis of the two methods under certain situations is provided to illustrate the two methods' efficiency. This paper also discusses nonsmooth convex optimization over sublevel sets of convex functions and provides numerical comparisons that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
