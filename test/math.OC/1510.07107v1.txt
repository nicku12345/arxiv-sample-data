Two distributed algorithms are described that enable all users connected over a network to cooperatively solve the problem of minimizing the sum of all users' objective functions over the intersection of all users' constraint sets, where each user has its own private nonsmooth convex objective function and closed convex constraint set, which is the intersection of a number of simple, closed convex sets. One algorithm enables each user to adjust its estimate by using a proximity operator of its objective function and the metric projection onto one set randomly selected from the simple, closed convex sets. The other is a distributed random projection algorithm that determines each user's estimate by using a subgradient of its objective function instead of the proximity operator. Investigation of the two algorithms' convergence properties for a diminishing step-size rule revealed that, under certain assumptions, the sequences of all users generated by each of the two algorithms converge almost surely to the same solution. Moreover, convergence rate analysis of the two algorithms is provided, and desired choices of the step size sequences such that the two algorithms have fast convergence are discussed. Numerical comparisons for concrete nonsmooth convex optimization support the convergence analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the two algorithms.
