This technical note studies the distributed optimization problem of a sum of nonsmooth convex cost functions with local constraints. At first, we propose a novel distributed continuous-time projected algorithm, in which each agent knows its local cost function and local constraint set, for the constrained optimization problem. Then we prove that all the agents of the algorithm can find the same optimal solution, and meanwhile, keep the states bounded while seeking the optimal solutions. We conduct a complete convergence analysis by employing nonsmooth Lyapunov functions for the stability analysis of differential inclusions. Finally, we provide a numerical example for illustration.
