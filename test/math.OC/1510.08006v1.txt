In this paper we propose two strongly convergent parallel hybrid iterative methods for finding a common element of the set of fixed points of a family of quasi \phi-asymptotically nonexpansive mappings \{F(S_j)\}_{j=1}^N, the set of solutions of variational inequalities \{VI(A_i,C)\}_{i=1}^M and the set of solutions of equilibrium problems \{EP(f_k)\}_{k=1}^K in uniformly smooth and 2-uniformly convex Banach spaces. A numerical experiment is given to verify the efficiency of the proposed parallel algorithms.
