In this paper, we propose two iterative methods for finding a common solution of a finite family of equilibrium problems for pseudomonotone bifunctions. The first is a parallel hybrid extragradient-cutting algorithm which is extended from the previously known one for variational inequalities to equilibrium problems. The second is a new cyclic hybrid extragradient-cutting algorithm. In the cyclic algorithm, using the known techniques, we can perform and develop practical numerical experiments.
