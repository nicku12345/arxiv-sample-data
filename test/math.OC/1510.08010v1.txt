In this paper, a novel parallel hybrid iterative method is proposed for finding a common element of the set of solutions of a system of equilibrium problems, the set of solutions of variational inequalities for inverse strongly monotone mappings and the set of fixed points of a finite family of nonexpansive mappings in Hilbert space. Strong convergence theorem is proved for the sequence generated by the scheme. Finally, a parallel iterative algorithm for two finite families of variational inequalities and nonexpansive mappings is established.
