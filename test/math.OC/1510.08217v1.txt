In this paper, we introduce some new hybrid algorithms for finding a solution of a system of equilibrium problems. In these algorithms, by constructing specially cutting-halfspaces, we avoid using the extra-steps as in the extragradient method and the Armijo linesearch method which are inherently costly when the feasible set has a complex structure. The strong convergence of the algorithms is established.
