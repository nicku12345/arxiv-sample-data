The paper proposes a novel hybrid method for solving equilibrium problems and fixed point problems. By constructing specially cutting-halfspaces, in this algorithm, only an optimization program is solved at each iteration without the extra-steps as in some previously known methods. The strongly convergence theorem is established and some numerical examples are presented to illustrate its convergence.
