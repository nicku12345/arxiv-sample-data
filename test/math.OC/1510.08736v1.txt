Multi-agent distributed optimization over a network minimizes a global objective formed by a sum of local convex functions using only local computation and communication. We develop and analyze a quantized distributed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) when inter-agent communications are subject to finite capacity and other practical constraints. While existing quantized ADMM approaches only work for quadratic local objectives, the proposed algorithm can deal with more general objective functions (possibly non-smooth) including the LASSO. Under certain convexity assumptions, our algorithm converges to a consensus within \log_{1+\eta}\Omega iterations, where \eta>0 depends on the local objectives and the network topology, and \Omega is a polynomial determined by the quantization resolution, the distance between initial and optimal variable values, the local objective functions and the network topology. A tight upper bound on the consensus error is also obtained which does not depend on the size of the network.
