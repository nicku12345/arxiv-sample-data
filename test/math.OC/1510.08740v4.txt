The {\it forward-backward algorithm} is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with a {\it additively separable} and {\it smooth} + {\it nonsmooth} structure. In the convex setting, a simple but ingenious acceleration scheme developed by Nesterov has been proved useful to improve the theoretical rate of convergence for the function values from the standard \mathcal O(k^{-1}) down to \mathcal O(k^{-2}). In this short paper, we prove that the rate of convergence of a slight variant of Nesterov's accelerated forward-backward method, which produces {\it convergent} sequences, is actually o(k^{-2}), rather than \mathcal O(k^{-2}). Our arguments rely on the connection between this algorithm and a second-order differential inclusion with vanishing damping.
