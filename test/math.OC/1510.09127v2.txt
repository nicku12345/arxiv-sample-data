We present a numerically tractable formulation for computing the optimal control of the class of hybrid dynamical systems whose trajectories are continuous. Our formulation, an extension of existing relaxed-control techniques for switched dynamical systems, incorporates the domain information of each discrete mode as part of the constraints in the optimization problem. Moreover, our numerical results are consistent with phenomena that are particular to hybrid systems, such as the creation of sliding trajectories between discrete modes.
