In this paper we study the complexity and domination analysis in the context of the \emph{bipartite quadratic assignment problem}. Two variants of the problem, denoted by BQAP1 and BQAP2, are investigated. A formula for calculating the average objective function value \mathcal{A} of all solutions is presented whereas computing the median objective function value is shown to be NP-hard. We show that any heuristic algorithm that produces a solution with objective function value at most \mathcal{A} has the domination ratio at least \frac{1}{mn}. Analogous results for the standard \emph{quadratic assignment problem} is an open question. We show that computing a solution whose objective function value is no worse than that of n^mm^n-{\lceil\frac{n}{\alpha}\rceil}^{\lceil\frac{m}{\alpha}\rceil}{\lceil\frac{m}{\alpha}\rceil}^{\lceil\frac{n}{\alpha}\rceil} solutions of BQAP1 or m^mn^n-{\lceil\frac{m}{\alpha}\rceil}^{\lceil\frac{m}{\alpha}\rceil}{\lceil\frac{n}{\alpha}\rceil}^{\lceil\frac{n}{\alpha}\rceil} solutions of BQAP2, is NP-hard for any fixed natural numbers a and b such that \alpha=\frac{a}{b}>1. However, a solution with the domination number \Omega(m^{n-1}n^{m-1}+m^{n+1}n+mn^{m+1}) for BQAP1 and \Omega(m^{m-1}n^{n-1}+m^2n^{n}+m^mn^2) for BQAP2, can be found in O(m^3n^3) time.
