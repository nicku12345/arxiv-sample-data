The first challenge in robustness analysis of large-scale interconnected uncertain systems is to provide a model of such systems in a standard-form that is required within different analysis frameworks. This becomes particularly important for large-scale systems, as analysis tools that can handle such systems heavily rely on the special structure within such model descriptions. We here propose an automated framework for providing such models of large-scale interconnected uncertain systems that are used in Integral Quadratic Constraint (IQC) analysis. Specifically, in this paper we put forth a methodological way to provide such models from a block-diagram and nested description of interconnected uncertain systems. We describe the details of this automated framework using an example.
