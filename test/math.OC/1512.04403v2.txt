This paper presents sufficient conditions for indexability (existence of the Whittle index) of general real-state discrete-time restless bandit projects under the discounted optimality criterion, which are not based on dynamic programming and do not require establishing first optimality of threshold policies as in prevailing approaches. The main contribution is a verification theorem establishing that, if project performance metrics under threshold policies and an explicitly defined marginal productivity (MP) index satisfy three conditions, then the project is indexable with its Whittle index being given by the MP index, in a form implying optimality of threshold policies for dynamic project control. Further contributions include characterizations of the index as a Radon-Nikodym derivative and as a shadow price, and a recursive index-computing scheme.
