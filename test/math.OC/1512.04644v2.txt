This paper considers state-of-the-art convex relaxations for the AC power flow equations and introduces new valid cuts based on convex envelopes and lifted nonlinear constraints. These valid linear inequalities strengthen existing semidefinite and quadratic programming relaxations and dominate existing cuts proposed in the litterature. Together with model intersections and bound tightening, the new linear cuts close 8 of the remaining 16 open test cases in the NESTA archive for the AC Optimal Power Flow problem.
