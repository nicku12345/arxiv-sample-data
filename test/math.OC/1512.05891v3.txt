In this paper we summarize our results in infinite horizon optimal control. We present optimality conditions for weak local minimizer in the framework of weighted functions. Moreover we formulate the Pontryagin Maximum Principle for strong local minimizer for trajectories converging at infinity. The considered problems, the requirements and the results depend on the choice of the function space.
