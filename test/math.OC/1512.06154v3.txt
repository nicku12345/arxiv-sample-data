We propose a simple projection and rescaling algorithm to solve the feasibility problem \[ \text{ find } x \in L \cap \Omega, \] where L and \Omega are respectively a linear subspace and the interior of a symmetric cone in a finite-dimensional vector space V.   This projection and rescaling algorithm is inspired by previous work on rescaled versions of the perceptron algorithm and by Chubanov's projection-based method for linear feasibility problems. As in these predecessors, each main iteration of our algorithm contains two steps: a {\em basic procedure} and a {\em rescaling} step. When L \cap \Omega \ne \emptyset, the projection and rescaling algorithm finds a point x \in L \cap \Omega in at most O(\log(1/\delta(L \cap \Omega))) iterations, where \delta(L \cap \Omega) \in (0,1] is a measure of the most interior point in L \cap \Omega. The ideal value \delta(L\cap \Omega) = 1 is attained when L \cap \Omega contains the center of the symmetric cone \Omega.   We describe several possible implementations for the basic procedure including a perceptron scheme and a smooth perceptron scheme. The perceptron scheme requires O(r^4) perceptron updates and the smooth perceptron scheme requires O(r^2) smooth perceptron updates, where r stands for the Jordan algebra rank of V.
