The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is funda- mental in power distribution networks control and operation that underlies many important applications such as volt/var control and demand response, etc.. Large-scale highly volatile renewable penetration in the distribution networks calls for real-time feed- back control, and hence the need for distributed solutions for the OPF problem. Distribution networks are inherently unbalanced and most of the existing distributed solutions for balanced networks do not apply. In this paper we propose a solution for unbalanced distribution networks. Our distributed algorithm is based on alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). Unlike existing approaches that require to solve semidefinite programming problems in each ADMM macro-iteration, we exploit the problem structures and decompose the OPF problem in such a way that the subproblems in each ADMM macro- iteration reduce to either a closed form solution or eigen-decomposition of a 6x6 hermitian matrix, which significantly reduce the convergence time. We present simulations on IEEE 13, 34, 37 and 123 bus unbalanced distribution networks to illustrate the scalability and optimality of the proposed algorithm.
