In this paper we propose and analyze three parallel hybrid extragradient methods for finding a common element of the set of solutions of equilibrium problems involving pseudomonotone bifunctions and the set of fixed points of nonexpansive mappings in a real Hilbert space. Based on parallel computation we can reduce the overall computational effort under widely used conditions on the bifunctions and the nonexpansive mappings.A simple numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed parallel algorithms.
