This paper investigates photoacoustic tomography with two spatially varying acoustic parameters, the compressibility and the density. We consider the reconstruction of the absorption density parameter (imaging parameter of Photoacoustics) with complete and partial measurement data. We investigate and analyze three different numerical methods for solving the imaging problem and compare the results.
