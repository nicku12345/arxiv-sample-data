A framework is developed for applying accelerated methods to general hyperbolic programming, including linear, second-order cone, and semidefinite programming as special cases. The approach replaces a hyperbolic program with a convex optimization problem whose smooth objective function is explicit, and for which the only constraints are linear equations (one more linear equation than for the original problem). Virtually any first-order method can be applied. Iteration bounds for a representative accelerated method are derived.
