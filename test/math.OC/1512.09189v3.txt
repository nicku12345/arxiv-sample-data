In a Markovian framework, we consider the problem of finding the minimal initial value of a controlled process allowing to reach a stochastic target with a given level of expected loss. This question arises typically in approximate hedging problems. The solution to this problem has been characterised by Bouchard, Elie and Touzi in [1] and is known to solve an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE with discontinuous operator. In this paper, we prove a comparison theorem for the corresponding PDE by showing first that it can be rewritten using a continuous operator, in some cases. As an application, we then study the quantile hedging price of Bermudan options in the non-linear case, pursuing the study initiated in [2].   [1] Bruno Bouchard, Romuald Elie, and Nizar Touzi.
