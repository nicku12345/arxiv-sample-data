We consider the existence of optimal shapes in the context of the thermomechanical system of partial differential equations (PDE) using the recent approach based on elliptic regularity theory. We give an extended and improved definition of the set of admissible shapes based on a class of sufficiently differentiable deformation maps applied to a baseline shape. The obtained set of admissible shapes again allows one to prove a uniform Schauder estimate for the elasticity PDE. In order to deal with thermal stress, a related uniform Schauder estimate is also given for the heat equation. Special emphasis is put on Robin boundary conditions, which are motivated from convective heat transfer. It is shown that these thermal Schauder estimates can serve as an input to the Schauder estimates for the elasticity equation. This is needed to prove the compactness of the (suitably extended) solutions of the entire PDE system in some state space that carries a c2-H\"older topology for the temperature field and a C3-H\"older topology for the displacement. From this one obtains he property of graph compactness, which is the essential tool in an proof of the existence of optimal shapes. Due to the topologies employed, the method works for objective functionals that depend on the displacement and its derivatives up to third order and on the temperature field and its derivatives up to second order. This general result in shape optimization is then applied to the problem of optimal reliability, i.e. the problem of finding shapes that have minimal failure probability under cyclic thermomechanical loading.
