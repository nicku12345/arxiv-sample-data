This paper is concerned with non-zero sum differential games of mean-field stochastic differential equations with partial information and convex control domain. First, applying the classical convex variations, we obtain stochastic maximum principle for Nash equilibrium points. Subsequently, under additional assumptions, verification theorem for Nash equilibrium points is also derived. Finally, as an application, a linear quadratic example is discussed. The unique Nash equilibrium point is represented in a feedback form of not only the optimal filtering but also expected value of the system state, throughout the solutions of the Riccati equations.
