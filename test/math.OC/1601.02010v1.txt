Recently, the problem of boundary stabilization for unstable linear constant-coefficient reaction-diffusion equation on N-balls has been solved by means of the backstepping method. However, the extension of this result to spatially-varying coefficients is far from trivial. This work deals with radially-varying reaction coefficients under revolution symmetry conditions on a disk (the 2-D case). Under these conditions, the equations become singular in the radius. When applying the backstepping method, the same type of singularity appears in the backstepping kernel equations. Traditionally, well-posedness of the kernel equations is proved by transforming them into integral equations and then applying the method of successive approximations. In this case, the resulting integral equation is singular. A successive approximation series can still be formulated, however its convergence is challenging to show due to the singularities. The problem is solved by a rather non-standard proof that uses the properties of the Catalan numbers, a well-known sequence frequently used in combinatorial mathematics.
