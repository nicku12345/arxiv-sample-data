In this paper, we propose two novel parallel hybrid methods for finding a common element of the set of solutions of a finite family of generalized equilibrium problems for monotone bifunctions \left\{f_i\right\}_{i=1}^N and \alpha - inverse strongly monotone operators \left\{A_i\right\}_{i=1}^N and the set of common fixed points of a finite family of (asymptotically) \kappa- strictly pseudocontractive mappings \left\{S_j\right\}_{j=1}^M in Hilbert spaces. The strong convergence theorems are established under the standard assumptions imposed on equilibrium bifunctions and operators. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed parallel methods.
