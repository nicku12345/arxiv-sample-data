The deepening penetration of renewables in power systems has contributed to the increasing needs for generation scheduling flexibility. Specifically, for short-term operations, flexibility here indicates that sufficient ramp capacities should be reserved to respond to the expected changes in the load and intermittent generation, also covering a certain amount of their uncertainty. To address the growing requirements for flexible ramp capacity, markets for ramp products have been launched in practice such as the ones in California ISO and Midcontinent ISO. Some-times, to guarantee sufficient ramp capacity, expensive fast start units have to be committed in real-time. Moreover, with higher penetration of renewable generation, the flexibility provided by the conventional units might not be enough. Actually, wind power producers are physically capable of offering flexibility, which is sometimes also economically efficient to the entire system. In this paper, we aim to explore the mechanism and possibility of including wind power producers as ramp providers to increase the supply of flexibility. To conduct the anal-yses, a two-stage stochastic real-time unit commitment model considering ramp capacity adequacy is formulated. Case studies indicate that both the system and the wind power producers can benefit if the wind power is allowed to provide flexible ramp products.
