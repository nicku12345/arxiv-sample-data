In this paper, we are concerned with the regional boundary controllability of the Riemann-Liouville time fractional diffusion systems of order \alpha\in (0,1]. The characterizations of strategic actuators are established when the systems studied are regionally boundary controllable. The determination of control to achieve regional boundary controllability with minimum energy is explored. We also show a connection between the regional internal controllability and regional boundary controllability. Several useful results for the optimal control from an implementation point of view are presented in the end.
