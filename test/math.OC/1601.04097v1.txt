This paper presents a novel framework which combines a non-iterative solution of Real-Time Nonlinear Receding Horizon Control (NRHC) methodology to achieve consensus within complex network topologies with existing time-delays and in presence of switching topologies. In this formulation, we solve the distributed nonlinear optimization problem for multi-agent network systems directly, \emph{in real-time}, without any dependency on iterative processes, where the stability and convergence guarantees are provided for the solution. Three benchmark examples on non-linear chaotic systems provide validated results which demonstrate the significant outcomes of such methodology.
