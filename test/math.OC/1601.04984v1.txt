This paper is devoted to the study of the turnpike phenomenon arising in the optimal distributed control tracking-type problem for the Navier-Stokes equations. We obtain a positive answer to this property in the case when the controls are time-dependent functions, and also when are independent of time. In both cases we prove an exponential turnpike property assuming that the stationary optimal state satisfy certain properties of smallness.
