An absorbing weighted Fermat-Torricelli tree of degree four is a weighted Fermat-Torricelli tree of degree four which is derived as a limiting tree structure from a generalized Gauss tree of degree three (weighted full Steiner tree) of the same boundary convex quadrilateral in R^2: By letting the four variable positive weights which correspond to the fixed vertices of the quadrilateral and satisfy the dynamic plasticity equations of the weighted quadrilateral, we obtain a family of limiting tree structures of generalized Gauss trees which concentrate to the same weighted Fermat-Torricelli tree of degree four (universal absorbing Fermat-Torricelli tree). The values of the residual absorbing rates for each derived weighted Fermat-Torricelli tree of degree four of the universal Fermat-Torricelli tree form a universal absorbing set. The minimum of the universal absorbing Fermat-Torricelli set is responsible for the creation of a generalized Gauss tree of degree three for a boundary convex quadrilateral derived by a weighted Fermat-Torricelli tree of a boundary triangle (Angiogenesis of degree three). Each value from the universal absorbing set contains an evolutionary process of a generalized Gauss tree of degree three.
