We develop a simple and accurate method to solve fractional variational and fractional optimal control problems with dependence on Caputo and Riemann-Liouville operators. Using known formulas for computing fractional derivatives of polynomials, we rewrite the fractional functional dynamical optimization problem as a classical static optimization problem. The method for classical optimal control problems is called Ritz's method. Examples show that the proposed approach is more accurate than recent methods available in the literature.
