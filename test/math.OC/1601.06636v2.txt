We consider the problem of stabilizing the bilayer \textit{Saint-Venant} model, which is a coupled system of two rightward and two leftward convecting transport partial differential equations (PDEs). In the stability proofs, we employ a Lyapunov function in which the parameters need to be successively determined. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time this kind of Lyapunov function is employed, and this result is the first one on the stabilization of the linearized bilayer \textit{Saint-Venant} model. Numerical simulations of the bilayer \textit{Saint-Venant} problem are also provided to verify the result.
