In this paper, we study the leader-following consensus problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems under jointly connected directed switching networks. The uncertainty includes constant unbounded parameters and external disturbances. We first extend the recent result on the adaptive distributed observer from global asymptotical convergence to global exponential convergence. Then, by integrating the conventional adaptive control technique with the adaptive distributed observer, we present our solution by a distributed adaptive state feedback control law. Our result is illustrated by the leader-following consensus problem for a group of van der Pol oscillators.
