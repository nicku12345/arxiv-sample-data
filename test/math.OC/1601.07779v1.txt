In this paper, we investigate a group sparse optimization problem via \ell_{p,q} regularization in three aspects: theory, algorithm and application. In the theoretical aspect, by introducing a notion of group restricted eigenvalue condition, we establish some oracle property and a global recovery bound of order O(\lambda^\frac{2}{2-q}) for any point in a level set of the \ell_{p,q} regularization problem, and by virtue of modern variational analysis techniques, we also provide a local analysis of recovery bound of order O(\lambda^2) for a path of local minima. In the algorithmic aspect, we apply the well-known proximal gradient method to solve the \ell_{p,q} regularization problems, either by analytically solving some specific \ell_{p,q} regularization subproblems, or by using the Newton method to solve general \ell_{p,q} regularization subproblems. In particular, we establish the linear convergence rate of the proximal gradient method for solving the \ell_{1,q} regularization problem under some mild conditions. As a consequence, the linear convergence rate of proximal gradient method for solving the usual \ell_{q} regularization problem (0<q<1) is obtained. Finally in the aspect of application, we present some numerical results on both the simulated data and the real data in gene transcriptional regulation.
