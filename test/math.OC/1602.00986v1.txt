In this paper we study a revenue maximization problem for optical routing nodes. We model the routing node as a single server polling model with the aim to assign visit periods (service windows) to the different stations (ports) such that the mean profit per cycle is maximized. Under reasonable assumptions regarding retrial and dropping probabilities of packets the optimization problem becomes a separable concave resource allocation problem, which can be solved using existing algorithms.
