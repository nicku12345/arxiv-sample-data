We consider strongly convex optimization problems with affine-type restrictions. We build dual problem and solve dual problem by Fast Gradient Method. We use primal-dual structure of this method to construct the solution of the primal problem. The paper contain a lot of different tricks that allows to generalize mentioned above results for almost all methods we would like to choose to solve the dual problem.
