This paper provides characterizations of the weak solutions of optimization problems where a given vector function F, from a decision space X to an objective space Y, is "minimized" on the set of elements x\in C (where C\subset X is a given nonempty constraint set), satisfying G\left( x\right) \leqq_{S}0_{Z}, where G is another given vector function from X  to a constraint space Z with positive cone S. The three spaces X,Y, and Z are locally convex Hausdorff topological vector spaces, with Y and Z partially ordered by two convex cones K and S, respectively, and enlarged with a greatest and a smallest element. In order to get suitable versions of the Farkas lemma allowing to obtain optimality conditions expressed in terms of the data, the triplet \left( F,G,C\right) , we use non-asymptotic representations of the K-epigraph of the conjugate function of F+I_{A}, where I_{A} denotes the indicator function of the feasible set A, that is, the function associating the zero vector of Y to any element of A and the greatest element of Y to any element of X\diagdown A.
