This paper is focused on probabilistic estimation for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body on the special orthogonal group. We select the matrix Fisher distribution to represent the uncertainties of attitude estimates and measurements in a global fashion without need for local coordinates. Several properties of the matrix Fisher distribution on the special orthogonal group are presented, and an unscented transform is proposed to approximate a matrix Fisher distribution by selected sigma points. Based on these, an intrinsic, global framework for Bayesian attitude estimation is developed. It is shown that the proposed approach can successfully deal with large initial estimator errors and large uncertainties over complex maneuvers to obtain accurate estimates of the attitude.
