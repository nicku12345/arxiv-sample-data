We address the problem of optimally controlling connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) crossing an urban intersection without any explicit traffic signaling, so as to minimize energy consumption subject to a throughput maximization requirement. We show that the solution of the throughput maximization problem depends only on the hard safety constraints imposed on CAVs and its structure enables a decentralized optimal control problem formulation for energy minimization. We present a complete analytical solution of these decentralized problems and derive conditions under which feasible solutions satisfying all safety constraints always exist. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is illustrated through simulation which shows substantial dual benefits of the proposed decentralized framework by allowing CAVs to conserve momentum and fuel while also improving travel time.
