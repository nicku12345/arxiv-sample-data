We present explicit sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the feasible load-flow solution for distribution networks with a generic topology (radial or meshed) modeled with positive sequence equivalents. In the problem, we also account for the presence of shunt elements. The conditions have low computational complexity and thus can be efficiently verified in a real system. Once the conditions are satisfied, the unique load-flow solution can be reached by a given fixed point iteration method of approximately linear complexity. Therefore, the proposed approach is of particular interest for modern active distribution network (ADN) setup in the context of real-time control. The theory has been confirmed through numerical experiments.
