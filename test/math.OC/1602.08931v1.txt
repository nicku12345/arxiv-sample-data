A class of infinite horizon optimal control problems involving L^p-type cost functionals with 0<p\leq 1 is discussed. The existence of optimal controls is studied for both the convex case with p=1 and the nonconvex case with 0<p<1, and the sparsity structure of the optimal controls promoted by the L^p-type penalties is analyzed. A dynamic programming approach is proposed to numerically approximate the corresponding sparse optimal controllers.
