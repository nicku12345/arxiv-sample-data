State transition algorithm (STA) has been emerging as a novel stochastic method for global optimization in recent few years. To make better understanding of continuous STA, a matlab toolbox for continuous STA has been developed. Firstly, the basic principles of continuous STA are briefly described. Then, a matlab implementation of the standard continuous STA is explained, with several instances given to show how to use to the matlab toolbox to minimize an optimization problem with bound constraints. In the same while, a link is provided to download the matlab toolbox via available resources.
