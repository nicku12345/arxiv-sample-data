We study two person nonzero-sum stochastic differential games with risk-sensitive discounted and ergodic cost criteria. Under certain conditions we establish a Nash equilibrium in Markov strategies for the discounted cost criterion and a Nash equilibrium in stationary strategies for the ergodic cost criterion. We achieve our results by studying the relevant systems of coupled HJB equations.
