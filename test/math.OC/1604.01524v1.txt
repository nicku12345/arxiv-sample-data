Extremal functions are exhibited in Poincar\'e trace inequalities for functions of bounded variation in the unit ball {\mathbb B}^n of the n-dimensional Euclidean space {\mathbb R}^n. Trial functions are subject to either a vanishing mean value condition, or a vanishing median condition in the whole of {\mathbb B}^n, instead of just on \partial {\mathbb B}^n, as customary. The extremals in question take a different form, depending on the constraint imposed. In particular, under the latter constraint, unusually shaped extremal functions appear. A key step in our approach is a characterization of the sharp constant in the relevant trace inequalities in any admissible domain \Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^n, in terms of an isoperimetric inequality for subsets of \Omega.
