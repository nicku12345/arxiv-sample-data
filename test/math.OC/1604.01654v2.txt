This works aims at understanding further convergence properties of first order local search methods with complex geometries. We focus on the composite optimization model which unifies within a simple formalism many problems of this type. We provide a general convergence analysis of the composite Gauss-Newton method under tameness assumptions (an extension of semi-algebraicity). Tameness is a very general condition satisfied by virtually all problems solved in practice. The analysis is based on recent progresses in understanding convergence properties of sequential convex programming methods through the value function.
