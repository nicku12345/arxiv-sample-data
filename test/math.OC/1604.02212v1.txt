The ball-constrained weighted maximin dispersion problem (\rm P_{ball}) is to find a point in an n-dimensional Euclidean ball such that the minimum of the weighted Euclidean distance from given m points is maximized. We propose a new second-order cone programming relaxation for (\rm P_{ball}). Under the condition m\le n, (\rm P_{ball}) is polynomial-time solvable since the new relaxation is shown to be tight. In general, we prove that ({\rm P_{ball}}) is NP-hard. Then, we propose a new randomized approximation algorithm for solving ({\rm P_{ball}}), which provides a new approximation bound of \frac{1-O(\sqrt{\ln(m)/n})}{2}.
