Two types of general nonlinear consensus protocols are considered in this paper, namely the systems with nonlinear measurement and communication of the agents' states, respectively. The solutions of the systems are understood in the sense of Filippov to handle the possible discontinuity of the nonlinear functions. For each case, we prove the asymptotic stability of the systems defined on both directed and undirected graphs. Then we reinterpret the results about the general models for a specific type of systems, i.e., the quantized consensus protocols, which extend some existing results (e.g., [1,2]) from undirected graphs to directed ones.
