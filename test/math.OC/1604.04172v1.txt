In this paper we consider the problem of finding the minimizations of the sum of two convex functions and the composition of another convex function with a continuous linear operator. With the idea of coordinate descent, we design a stochastic coordinate descent primal-dual splitting algorithm with dynamic stepsize. Based on randomized Modified Krasnosel'skii-Mann iterations and the firmly nonexpansive properties of the proximity operator, we achieve the convergence of the proposed algorithms. Moreover, we give two applications of our method.
