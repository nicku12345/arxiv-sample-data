The minimum-fuel orbital transfer is analyzed in the case of a launcher upper stage using a constantly thrusting engine. The thrust level is assumed to be constant and its value is optimized together with the thrust direction. A closed-loop solution for the thrust direction is derived from the extremal analysis for a planar orbital transfer. The optimal control problem reduces to two unknowns, namely the thrust level and the final time. Guessing and propagating the costates is no longer necessary and the optimal trajectory is easily found from a rough initialization. On the other hand the initial costates are assessed analytically from the initial conditions and they can be used as initial guess for transfers at different thrust levels. The method is exemplified on a launcher upper stage targeting a geostationary transfer orbit.
