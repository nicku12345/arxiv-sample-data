We consider the problem of finding the minimization of the sum of a convex function and the composition of another convex function with a continuous linear operator from the view of fixed point algorithms based on proximity operators. We design a primal-dual fixed point algorithm with dynamic stepsize based on the proximity operator and obtain a scheme with a closed form solution for each iteration. Based on Modified Mann iteration and the firmly nonexpansive properties of the proximity operator, we achieve the convergence of the proposed algorithm.
