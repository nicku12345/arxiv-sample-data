Wide-area control is an effective mean to reduce inter-area oscillations of large power systems. Its dependence on communication of remote measurement signals makes the closed-loop system vulnerable to cyber attacks. This paper develops a framework to analyze and quantify resilience of a given wide-area controller under disruptive attacks on certain communication links. Resilience of a given controller is measured in terms of closed-loop eigenvalues under the worst possible attack strategy. The computation of such a resilience index is challenging especially for large-scale power systems due to the discrete nature of the attack strategies. To address the challenge, we propose an optimization-based formulation and a convex relaxation approach to facilitate the computation. Conditions under which the relaxation is exact are derived and an efficient algorithm with guaranteed convergence is also developed. The proposed framework and the algorithm allow us to quantify resilience for given wide-area controllers and also provide sufficient conditions to guarantee closed-loop stability under all possible communication attacks. Simulations are performed on the IEEE 39-bus system to illustrate the proposed resilience analysis and computation framework.
