The aim of this work is to design an explicit finite dimensional boundary feedback controller for locally exponentially stabilizing the equilibrium solutions to Fisher's equation in both L^2(0,1) and H^1(0,1). The feedback controller is expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions corresponding to unstable eigenvalues of the linearized equation. This stabilizing procedure is applicable for any level of instability, which extends the result of \cite{02} for nonlinear parabolic equations. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by a numerical simulation.
