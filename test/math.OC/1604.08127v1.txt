This document is an internet supplement to my book "Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes - From Filtering to Controlled Sensing" published by Cambridge University Press in 2016. This internet supplement contains exercises, examples and case studies. The material appears in this internet supplement (instead of the book) so that it can be updated. This document will evolve over time and further discussion and examples will be added. This internet supplement document is work in progress and will be updated periodically. I welcome constructive comments from readers of the book and this internet supplement.
