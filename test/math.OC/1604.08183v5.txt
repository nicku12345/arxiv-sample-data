We consider mixed model of traffic flow distribution in large networks (BMW model, 1954 & Stable Dynamic model, 1999). We build dual problem and consider primal-dual mirror descent method for the dual problem. There are two ways to recover the solution of the primal problem. First technique is based on "models" approach and second one is based on Lagrange multiplyers technique. Both approaches have its own advantages and drawbacks. We discuss them.
