We prove a novel Lyapunov-based small-gain theorem for networks of  n \geq 2  hybrid systems which are not necessarily input-to-state stable. This result unifies and extends several small-gain theorems for hybrid and impulsive systems proposed in the last few years. We also show how average dwell-time (ADT) clocks and reverse ADT clocks can be used to modify the Lyapunov functions for subsystems and to enlarge the applicability of the derived small-gain theorems.
