We apply upper and lower compensated convex transforms, which are `tight' one-sided approximations of a given function, to the extraction of fine geometric singularities from semiconvex/semiconcave functions and DC-functions in \mathbb{R}^n (difference of convex functions). Well-known examples of (locally) semiconcave functions include the Euclidean distance and squared distance functions. For a locally semiconvex function f with general modulus, we show that `locally' a point is a singular (non-differentiable) point if and only if it is a scale 1-valley point, and if x is a singular point, then locally the limit of the scaled valley transform exists at every point x and  \lim_{\lambda\to \infty}\lambda V_\lambda (f)(x)=r_x^2/4, where r_x is the radius of the minimal bounding sphere of the (Fr\'echet) subdifferential \partial_- f(x) and V_\lambda (f)(x) is the valley transform at x. Thus the limit function \mathcal{V}_\infty(f)(x):=\lim_{\lambda\to+\infty}\lambda V_\lambda (f)(x)=r_x^2/4 gives a `scale 1-valley landscape function' of the singular set for a locally semiconvex function f, and also provides an asymptotic expansion of the upper transform C^u_\lambda(f)(x) when \lambda \to \infty. For a locally semiconvex function f with linear modulus we show that the limit of the gradient of the upper compensated convex transform \lim_{\lambda\to+\infty}\nabla C^u_\lambda(f)(x) exists and equals the centre of the minimal bounding sphere of \partial_- f(x, and that for a DC-function f=g-h, the scale 1-edge transform satisfies \liminf_{\lambda\to+\infty}\lambda E_\lambda (f)(x)\geq (r_{g,x}-r_{h,x})^2/4, where r_{g,x} and r_{h,x} are the radii of the minimal bounding spheres of the subdifferentials \partial_- g and \partial_- h of the convex functions g and h at x respectively.
