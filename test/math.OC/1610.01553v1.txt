In this paper, we consider a coordination problem for a class of heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent systems with a prescribed input-output behavior which was represented by another input-driven system. In contrast to most existing multi-agent coordination results with an autonomous (virtual) leader, this formulation takes possible control inputs of the leader into consideration. First, the coordination was achieved by utilizing a group of distributed observers based on conventional assumptions of model matching problem. Then, a fully distributed adaptive extension was proposed without using the input of this input-output behavior. An example was given to verify their effectiveness.
