In this paper we investigate the design of an active fault tolerant control system applicable to autonomous flight. The system comprises a nonlinear model predictive based controller integrated with an unscented Kalman filter for fault detection and identification. We apply the fault tolerant control system design to a generic aircraft model, and simulate a failed engine scenario. The results show that the system correctly identifies the fault within seconds of occurrence and updates the nonlinear model predictive controller which is then able to reallocate control authority to the healthy actuators based upon up to date fault information.
