In the context of linear inverse problems, we propose and study a general iterative regularization method allowing to consider large classes of regularizers and data-fit terms. The algorithm we propose is based on a primal-dual diagonal {descent} method. Our analysis establishes convergence as well as stability results. Theoretical findings are complemented with numerical experiments showing state of the art performances.
