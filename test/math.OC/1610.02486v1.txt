This paper is mainly concerned with the solutions to both forward and backward mean-field stochastic partial differential equation and the corresponding optimal control problem for mean-field stochastic partial differential equation. We first prove the continuous dependence theorems of forward and backward mean-field stochastic partial differential equations and show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to them. Then we establish necessary and sufficient optimality conditions of the control problem in the form of Pontryagin's maximum principles. To illustrate the theoretical results, we apply stochastic maximum principles to study an example, an infinite-dimensional linear-quadratic control problem of mean-field type. Further an application to a Cauchy problem for a controlled stochastic linear PDE of mean-field type are studied.
