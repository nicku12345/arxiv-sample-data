In this manuscript we develop necessary optimality conditions for weak and strong minimizer in control problems on finite and infinite horizon. We show, that the control problems on the infinite horizon are proper generalizations of the finite horizon problems. Therefore, we have to develop an innovative theoretical approach.   The first chapters are devoted to known results and methods for weak and strong minimizer in the Calculus of Variations and in finite horizon Optimal Control Theory. In the last parts we extend these methods to optimal multiprocesses and to infinite horizon optimal control problems.
