This paper is concerned with linear quadratic optimal control problems for mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (MF-BSDEs, for short) with deterministic coefficients. The optimality system, which is a linear mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equation with constraint, is obtained by a variational method. By decoupling the optimality system, two coupled Riccati equations and an MF-BSDE are derived. It turns out that the coupled two Riccati equations are uniquely solvable. Then a complete and explicit representation is obtained for the optimal control.
