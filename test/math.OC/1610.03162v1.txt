Fault tolerance is achieved through multiply redundant hardware systems in large civil aircraft. This means of achieving fault tolerance is infeasible for small compact unmanned aerial vehicles. In this paper we apply a fault tolerant control system which exploits analytical redundancy rather than hardware redundancy to an actual UAV model currently in operation via model-in-the-loop simulation. The fault tolerant control system comprises a nonlinear model predictive controller integrated with an unscented Kalman filter for fault detection and identification. The results show that our fault tolerant control system design is able to identify engine failure within seconds of fault occurrence and distribute control authority to the healthy actuators to maintain safe flight.
