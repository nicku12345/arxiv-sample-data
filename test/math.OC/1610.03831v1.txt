The limited memory steepest descent method (LMSD) proposed by Fletcher is an extension of the Barzilai-Borwein "two-point step size" strategy for steepest descent methods for solving unconstrained optimization problems. It is known that the Barzilai-Borwein strategy yields a method with an R-linear rate of convergence when it is employed to minimize a strongly convex quadratic. This paper extends this analysis for LMSD, also for strongly convex quadratics. In particular, it is shown that the method is R-linearly convergent for any choice of the history length parameter. The results of numerical experiments are provided to illustrate behaviors of the method that are revealed through the theoretical analysis.
