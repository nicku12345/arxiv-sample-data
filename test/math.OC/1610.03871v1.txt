Interior point methods solve small to medium sized problems to high accuracy in a reasonable amount of time. However, for larger problems as well as stochastic problems, one needs to use first-order methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and conjugate gradient (CG) in order to attain a modest accuracy in a reasonable number of iterations. In this report, we first discuss heuristics for diagonal scaling. Next, we motivate preconditioning by an example, and then we study preconditioning for a specific splitting form in ADMM called graph projection splitting. Finally we examine the performance of our methods by some numerical examples.
