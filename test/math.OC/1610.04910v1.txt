We study a class of stochastic evolution equations of jump type with random coefficients and its optimal control problem. There are three major ingredients. The first is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solutions by continuous dependence theorem of solutions combining with the parameter extension method. The second is to establish the stochastic maximum principle and verification theorem for our optimal control problem by the classic convex variation method and dual technique. The third is to represent an example of a Cauchy problem for a controlled stochastic partial differential equation with jumps which our theoretical results can solve.
