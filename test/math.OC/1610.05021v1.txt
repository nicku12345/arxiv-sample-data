This paper is concerned with stochastic linear quadratic (LQ, for short) optimal control problems in an infinite horizon with constant coefficients. It is proved that the non-emptiness of the admissible control set for all initial state is equivalent to the L^2-stabilizability of the control system, which in turn is equivalent to the existence of a positive solution to an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE, for short). Different from the finite horizon case, it is shown that both the open-loop and closed-loop solvabilities of the LQ problem are equivalent to the existence of a static stabilizing solution to the associated generalized ARE. Moreover, any open-loop optimal control admits a closed-loop representation. Finally, the one-dimensional case is worked out completely to illustrate the developed theory.
