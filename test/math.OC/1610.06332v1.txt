This paper deals with energy management in a district where multiple buildings can communicate over a time-varying network and aim at optimizing the use of shared resources like storage systems. We focus on building cooling, and propose an iterative, distributed algorithm that accounts for information privacy, since buildings are not required to disclose information about their individual utility functions and constraint sets encoding, e.g., their consumption profiles, and overcomes the communication and computational challenges imposed by centralized management paradigms. Our approach relies on a methodology based on proximal minimization that has recently appeared in the literature. Motivated by the structure of the considered energy management optimization program, we provide a theoretical extension of this novel methodology, that is applicable to any problem that exhibits such structural properties. The efficacy of the resulting energy management algorithm is illustrated by means of a detailed simulation based study, considering different network topologies.
