We use a white noise approach to study the problem of optimal inside control of a stochastic delay equation driven by a Brownian motion B and a Poisson random measure N. In particular, we use Hida-Malliavin calculus and the Donsker delta functional to study the problem.   We establish a sufficient and a necessary maximum principle for the optimal control when the trader from the beginning has inside information about the future value of some random variable related to the system.These results are applied to the problem of optimal inside harvesting control in a population modelled by a stochastic delay equation.   Next, we apply a direct white noise method to find the optimal insider portfolio in a financial market where the risky asset price is given by a stochastic delay equation. A classical result of Pikovski and Karatzas shows that when the inside information is B(T), where T is the terminal time of the trading period, then the market is not viable. Our results show that with this inside information the market is not viable even if there is delay in the equations.
