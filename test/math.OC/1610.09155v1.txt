In this paper the geometric dimensions of a compressive helical spring made of power law materials are optimized to reduce the amount of material. The mechanical constraints are derived to form the geometric programming problem. Both the prime and the dual problem are examined and solved semi-analytically for a range of spring index. A numerical example is provided to validate the solutions.
