The optimization of process economics within the model predictive control (MPC) formulation has given rise to a new control paradigm known as economic MPC (EMPC). Several authors have discussed the closed-loop properties of EMPC-controlled deterministic systems, however, little have uncertain systems been studied. In this paper we propose EMPC formulations for nonlinear Markovian switching systems which guarantee recursive feasibility, asymptotic performance bounds and constrained mean square (MS) stability.
