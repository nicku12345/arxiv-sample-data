We consider the decentralized control of radial distribution systems with controllable photovoltaic inverters and energy storage resources. For such systems, we investigate the problem of designing fully decentralized controllers that minimize the expected cost of balancing demand, while guaranteeing the satisfaction of individual resource and distribution system voltage constraints. Employing a linear approximation of the branch flow model, we formulate this problem as the design of a decentralized disturbance-feedback controller that minimizes the expected value of a convex quadratic cost function, subject to robust convex quadratic constraints on the system state and input. As such problems are, in general, computationally intractable, we derive a tractable inner approximation to this decentralized control problem, which enables the efficient computation of an affine control policy via the solution of a finite-dimensional conic program. As affine policies are, in general, suboptimal for the family of systems considered, we provide an efficient method to bound their suboptimality via the optimal solution of another finite-dimensional conic program. A case study of a 12 kV radial distribution system demonstrates that decentralized affine controllers can perform close to optimal.
