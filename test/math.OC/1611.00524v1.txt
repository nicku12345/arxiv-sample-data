We consider different choice procedures such as scoring rules, rules, using majority relation, value function and tournament matrix, which are used in social and multi-criteria choice problems. We focus on the study of the properties that show how the final choice is changed due to changes of preferences or a set of feasible alternatives. As a result a theorem is provided showing which normative properties (rationality, monotonicity, non-compensability) are satisfied for the given choice procedures.
