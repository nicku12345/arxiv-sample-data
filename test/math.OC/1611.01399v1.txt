The authors propose robust adaptive strategies based on stochastic minimax optimization for a series of simulated treatments on a one-dimensional patient phantom. The plan applied during the first fractions should be able to handle anticipated systematic and random errors. At scheduled fractions, the impact of the measured errors on the delivered dose distribution is evaluated. For a patient receiving a dose that does not satisfy clinical goals, the plan is reoptimized based on these individually measured errors. The adapted plan is then applied during subsequent fractions until a new scheduled adaptation becomes necessary. In the first adaptive strategy, the measured systematic and random error scenarios and their assigned probabilities are updated to guide the robust reoptimization. In the second strategy, the grade of conservativeness is adapted in response to the measured dose delivery errors. In the third strategy, the uncertainty margins around the target are recalculated based on the measured errors. The simulated systematic and random errors are either similar to the anticipated errors or unpredictably larger, in order to critically evaluate the performance of the adaptive strategies. The simulations show that robustly optimized treatment plans provide sufficient treatment quality for those treatment error scenarios similar to the anticipated error scenarios. Combining robust planning with adaptation leads to improved OAR protection. In case of unpredictably larger treatment errors, the first strategy performs best at improving treatment quality in terms of target coverage and OAR protection. According to the simulations, these robust adaptive treatment strategies are able to identify candidates for an adaptive treatment, thus giving the opportunity to provide individualized plans, and improve their treatment quality through adaptation.
