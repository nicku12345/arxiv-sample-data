This paper is concerned with the problem of finding the optimal of extraction policies of an oil field in light of various financial and economical restrictions and constraints. Taking into account the fact that the oil price in worldwide commodity markets fluctuates randomly following global and seasonal macro-economic parameters, we model the evolution of the oil price as a mean reverting regime switching jump diffusion process. We formulate this problem as finite-time horizon optimal control problem. We solve the control problem using the method of viscosity solutions. Moreover, we construct and prove the convergence of a numerical scheme for approximating the optimal reward function and the optimal extraction policy. A numerical example that illustrates these results is presented.
