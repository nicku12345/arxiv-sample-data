In this paper, we consider joint drift rate control and impulse control for a stochastic inventory system under long-run average cost criterion. Assuming the inventory level must be nonnegative, we prove that a \{(0,q^{\star},Q^{\star},S^{\star}),\{\mu^{\star}(x): x\in[0, S^{\star}]\}\} policy is an optimal joint control policy, where the impulse control follows the control band policy (0,q^{\star},Q^{\star},S^{\star}), that brings the inventory level up to q^{\star} once it drops to 0 and brings it down to Q^{\star} once it rises to S^{\star}, and the drift rate only depends on the current inventory level and is given by function \mu^{\star}(x) for the inventory level x\in[0,S^{\star}]. The optimality of the \{(0,q^{\star},Q^{\star},S^{\star}),\{\mu^{\star}(x): x\in[0,S^{\star}]\}\} policy is proven by using a lower bound approach, in which a critical step is to prove the existence and uniqueness of optimal policy parameters. To prove the existence and uniqueness, we develop a novel analytical method to solve a free boundary problem consisting of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and several free boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that the optimal drift rate \mu^{\star}(x) is firstly increasing and then decreasing as x increases from 0 to S^{\star} with a turnover point between Q^{\star} and S^{\star}.
