We extend the notion of some energy-type expressions based on two sets, developed in the abstract potential theory. We also give the discretized version of the quantities defined, similar to Chebyshev constant. This extension allows to apply the potential-theoretic results to infinite quadratic programming problems. Together with a cutting plane algorithm, the Chebyshev-constant method ensures that under certain conditions, the infinite problem can be reduced to semi-infinite or to finite problems.
