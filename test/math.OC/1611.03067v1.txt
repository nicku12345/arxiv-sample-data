In this report, we aim at the development of an online abstraction framework for multi-agent systems under coupled constraints. The motion capabilities of each agent are abstracted through a finite state transition system in order to capture reachability properties of the coupled multi-agent system over a finite time horizon in a decentralized manner. In the first part of this work, we define online abstractions by discretizing an overapproximation of the agents' reachable sets over the horizon. Then, sufficient conditions relating the discretization and the agent's dynamics properties are provided, in order to quantify the transition possibilities of each agent.
