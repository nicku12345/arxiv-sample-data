In this paper we establish an \mathcal{O}({1}/{k}) weighted iteration complexity on the KKT residuals yielded by the sPADMM (semi-proximal alternating direction method of multiplier) for the convex composite optimization problem. This result, which is derived with the help of a novel generalized HPE (hybrid proximal extra-gradient) iteration formula, first fills the gap on the ergodic iteration complexity of the classic ADMM with a large step-size and its many proximal variants.
