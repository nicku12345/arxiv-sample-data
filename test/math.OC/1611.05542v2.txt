This technical note considers a distributed convex optimization problem with nonsmooth cost functions and coupled nonlinear inequality constraints. To solve the problem, we first propose a modified Lagrangian function containing local multipliers and a nonsmooth penalty function. Then we construct a distributed continuous-time algorithm by virtue of a projected primal-dual subgradient dynamics. Based on the nonsmooth analysis and Lyapunov function, we obtain the existence of the solution to the nonsmooth algorithm and its convergence.
