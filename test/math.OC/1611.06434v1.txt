This paper is concerned with a linear quadratic (LQ, for short) optimal control problem for mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (MF-BSDE, for short) driven by a Poisson random martingale measure and a Brownian motion. Firstly, by the classic convex variation principle, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control is established. Secondly, the optimal control is characterized by the stochastic Hamilton system which turns out to be a linear fully coupled mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equation with jumps by the duality method. Thirdly, in terms of a decoupling technique, the stochastic Hamilton system is decoupled by introducing two Riccati equations and a MF-BSDE with jumps. Then an explicit representation for the optimal control is obtained.
