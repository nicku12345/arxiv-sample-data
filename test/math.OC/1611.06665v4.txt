The purpose of this paper is to introduce and investigate a new system of global fractional-order interval implicit projection neural networks. An existence and uniqueness theorem of the equilibrium point for such kind of global fractional-order interval implicit projection neural networks is obtained under some suitable assumptions. Moreover, Mittag-Leffler stability of the global fractional-order interval implicit projection neural networks is also proved. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity of our results.
