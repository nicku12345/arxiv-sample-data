In this paper we consider a sufficiently broad class of nonlinear mathematical programs with disjunctive constraints, which, e.g., include mathematical programs with complemetarity/vanishing constraints. We present an extension of the concept of {\mathcal Q}-stationarity as introduced in the recent paper [2]. {\mathcal Q}-stationarity can be easily combined with the well-known notion of M-stationarity to obtain the stronger property of so-called {\mathcal Q}_M-stationarity. We show how the property of {\mathcal Q}_M-stationarity (and thus also of M-stationarity) can be efficiently verified for the considered problem class by computing {\mathcal Q}-stationary solutions of a certain quadratic program. We consider further the situation that the point which is to be tested for {\mathcal Q}_M-stationarity, is not known exactly, but is approximated by some convergent sequence, as it is usually the case when applying some numerical method.
