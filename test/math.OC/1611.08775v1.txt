In this paper, we study unit commitment (UC) problems considering the uncertainty of load and wind power generation. UC problem is formulated as a chance-constrained two-stage stochastic programming problem where the chance constraint is used to restrict the probability of load imbalance. In addition to the conventional mixed integer linear programming formulation using Big-M, we present the bilinear mixed integer formulation of chance constraint, and then derive its linear counterpart using McCormick linearization method. Then, we develop a bilinear variant of Benders decomposition method, which is an easy-to-implement algorithm, to solve the resulting large-scale linear counterpart. Our results on typical IEEE systems demonstrate that (i) the bilinear mixed integer programming formula-tion is stronger than the conventional one; (ii) the proposed Benders decomposition algorithm is generally an order of magnitude faster than using a professional solver to directly compute both linear and bilinear chance-constrained UC models.
