In this paper, we prove that the global version of the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality holds for quadratic sphere constrained optimization problem with exponent \theta=\frac{3}{4}. An example from Ting Kei Pong shows that \theta=\frac{3}{4} is tight. This is the first {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality established for the sphere constrained optimization problem with a linear term.
