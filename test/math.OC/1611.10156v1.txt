We consider multi-agent decision making, where each agent optimizes its cost function subject to constraints. Agents' actions belong to a compact convex Euclidean space and the agents' cost functions are coupled. We propose a distributed payoff-based algorithm to learn Nash equilibria in the game between agents. Each agent uses only information about its current cost value to compute its next action. We prove convergence of the proposed algorithm to a Nash equilibrium in the game leveraging established results on stochastic processes. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed with a numerical case study.
