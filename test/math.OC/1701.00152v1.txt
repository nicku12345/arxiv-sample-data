In this work, we introduce the notion of regularization of bifunctions in a similar way as the well- known convex, quasiconvex and lower semicontinuous regularizations due to Crouzeix. We show that the Equilibrium Problems associated to bifunctions and their regularizations are equivalent in the sense of having the same solution set. Also, we present new results of existence of solutions for Equilibrium Problems.
