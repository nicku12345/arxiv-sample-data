By a memory mean-field process we mean the solution X(\cdot) of a stochastic mean-field equation involving not just the current state X(t) and its law \mathcal{L}(X(t)) at time t, but also the state values X(s) and its law \mathcal{L}(X(s)) at some previous times s<t. Our purpose is to study stochastic control problems of memory mean-field processes.   - We consider the space \mathcal{M} of measures on \mathbb{R} with the norm || \cdot||_{\mathcal{M}} introduced by Agram and {\O}ksendal in \cite{AO1}, and prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of memory mean-field stochastic functional differential equations.   - We prove two stochastic maximum principles, one sufficient (a verification theorem) and one necessary, both under partial information. The corresponding equations for the adjoint variables are a pair of \emph{(time-) advanced backward stochastic differential equations}, one of them with values in the space of bounded linear functionals on path segment spaces.   - As an application of our methods, we solve a memory mean-variance problem as well as a linear-quadratic problem of a memory process.
