We consider convex stochastic optimization problems under different assumptions on the properties of available stochastic subgradient. It is known that, if the value of the objective function is available, one can obtain, in parallel, several independent approximate solutions in terms of the objective residual expectation. Then, choosing the solution with the minimum function value, one can control the probability of large deviation of the objective residual. On the contrary, in this short paper, we address the situation, when the value of the objective function is unavailable or is too expensive to calculate. Under "`light-tail"' assumption for stochastic subgradient and in general case with moderate large deviation probability, we show that parallelization combined with averaging gives bounds for probability of large deviation similar to a serial method. Thus, in these cases, one can benefit from parallel computations and reduce the computational time without loss in the solution quality.
