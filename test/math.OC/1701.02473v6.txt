We describe how primal-dual version of Nesterov's Universal Method (with one projection) can be applied to solve the dual problem for the problem of searching equilibrium traffic flow distribution in transport networks (BMW-model, Stable Dynamic model). We observe that although the dual problem isn't smooth Universal Methods works as it is Mirror Prox method and we consider saddle-point type problem.
