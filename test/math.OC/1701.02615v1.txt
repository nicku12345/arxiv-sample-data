Measuring attenuation coefficients is a fundamental problem that can be solved with diverse techniques such as X-ray or optical tomography and lidar. We propose a novel approach based on the observation of a sample from a few different angles. This principle can be used in existing devices such as lidar or various types of fluorescence microscopes. It is based on the resolution of a nonlinear inverse problem. We propose a specific computational approach to solve it and show the well-foundedness of the approach on simulated data. Some of the tools developed are of independent interest. In particular we propose an efficient method to correct attenuation defects, new robust solvers for the lidar equation as well as new efficient algorithms to compute the Lambert W function and the proximal operator of the logsumexp function in dimension 2.
