The Uzawa method is a method for solving constrained optimization problems, and is often used in computational contact mechanics. The simplicity of this method is an advantage, but its convergence is slow. This paper presents an accelerated variant of the Uzawa method. The proposed method can be viewed as application of an accelerated projected gradient method to the Lagrangian dual problem. Preliminary numerical experiments suggest that the convergence of the proposed method is much faster than the original Uzawa method.
