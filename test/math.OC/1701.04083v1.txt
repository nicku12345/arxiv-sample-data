In this paper, we are concerned with the null controllability of a linear population dynamics cascade systems (or the so-called prey-predator models) with two different dispersion coefficients which degenerate in the boundary and with one control force. We develop first a Carleman type inequality for its adjoint system, and then an observability inequality which allows us to deduce the existence of a control acting on a subset of the space domain which steers both populations of a certain age to extinction in a finite time.
