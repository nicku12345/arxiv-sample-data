This paper is devoted to a simple and new proof on the optimal finite control time for general linear coupled hyperbolic system by using boundary feedback on one side. The feedback control law is designed by first using a Volterra transformation of the second kind and then using an invertible Fredholm transformation. Both existence and invertibility of the transformations are easily obtained.
