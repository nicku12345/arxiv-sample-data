This paper deals with designing a robust fixed-order dynamic output feedback controller for uncertain fractional order linear time invariant (FO-LTI) systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Our purpose is to design a low order controller that stabilizes the fractional-order linear system in the presence of model uncertainties. No limitative constraint on the state space matrices of the uncertain system is assumed in the design procedure. Furthermore, adopting the most complete model of linear controller, with direct feedthrough parameter, does not disturb the LMI-based approach of developing robust stabilizing control. Eventually, the authors illustrate the advantages of the proposed method by some examples and their numerical simulation.
