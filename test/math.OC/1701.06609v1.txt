In this paper we consider an optimal control problem for the coupled system of a nonlinear monotone Dirichlet problem with anisotropic p-Laplacian and matrix-valued nonsmooth controls in its coefficients and a nonlinear equation of Hammerstein type. Using the direct method in calculus of variations, we prove the existence of an optimal control in considered problem and provide sensitivity analysis for a specific case of considered problem with respect to two-parameter regularization.
