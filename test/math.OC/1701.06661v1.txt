This paper considers mean field games in a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) framework. Each player has a continuum state and binary action. By active control, a player can bring its state to a resetting point. All players are coupled through their cost functions. The structural property of the individual strategies is characterized in terms of threshold policies when the mean field game admits a solution. We further introduce a stationary equation system of the mean field game and analyze uniqueness of its solution under positive externalities.
