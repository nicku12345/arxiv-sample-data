In this paper, we introduce a class of variational inequalities, where the involved function is the sum of an arbitrary given vector and a homogeneous polynomial defined by a tensor; and we call it the tensor variational inequality (TVI). The TVI is a natural extension of the affine variational inequality and the tensor complementarity problem. We show that a class of multi-person noncooperative games can be formulated as a TVI. In particular, we investigate the global uniqueness and solvability of the TVI. To this end, we first introduce two classes of structured tensors and discuss some related properties; and then, we show that the TVI has the property of global uniqueness and solvability under some assumptions, which is different from the existed result for the general variational inequality.
