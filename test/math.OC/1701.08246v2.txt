The article continues the study of the 'regular' arrangement of a collection of sets near a point in their intersection. Such regular intersection or, in other words, transversality properties are crucial for the validity of qualification conditions in optimisation as well as subdifferential, normal cone and coderivative calculus, and convergence analysis of computational algorithms. One of the main motivations for the development of the transversality theory of collections of sets comes from the convergence analysis of alternating projections for solving feasibility problems. This article targets infinite dimensional extensions of the intrinsic transversality property introduced recently by Drusvyatskiy, Ioffe and Lewis as a sufficient condition for local linear convergence of alternating projections. Several characterisations of this property are established involving new limiting objects defined for pairs of sets. Special attention is given to the convex case.
