In this paper, we generalize the chance optimization problems and introduce constrained volume optimization where enables us to obtain convex formulation for challenging problems in systems and control. We show that many different problems can be cast as a particular cases of this framework. In constrained volume optimization, we aim at maximizing the volume of a semialgebraic set under some semialgebraic constraints. Building on the theory of measures and moments, a sequence of semidefinite programs are provided, whose sequence of optimal values is shown to converge to the optimal value of the original problem. We show that different problems in the area of systems and control that are known to be nonconvex can be reformulated as special cases of this framework. Particularly, in this work, we address the problems of probabilistic control of uncertain systems as well as inner approximation of region of attraction and invariant sets of polynomial systems. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the computational performance of the proposed approach.
