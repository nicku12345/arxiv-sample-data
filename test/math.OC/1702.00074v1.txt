In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition approach for mixed-integer stochastic programming (SMIP) problems that is inspired by the combination of penalty-based Lagrangian and block Gauss-Seidel methods (PBGS). In this sense, PBGS is developed such that the inherent decomposable structure that SMIPs present can be exploited in a computationally efficient manner. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the Progressive Hedging method (PH), which also can be viewed as a Lagrangian-based method for obtaining solutions for SMIP. Numerical experiments performed using instances from the literature illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of computational performance and solution quality.
