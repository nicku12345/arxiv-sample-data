In this paper, a non-linear p-robust hub location problem is extended to a risky environment where augmented chance constraint with a min-max regret form is employed to consider network risk as one of the objectives. The model considers risk factors such as security, air pollution and congestion to design the robust hub network. A Monte-Carlo simulation based algorithm, namely, a sample average approximation scheme is applied to select a set of efficient scenarios. The problem is then solved using a novel relax-and-decomposition heuristic based on the coupling of an accelerated Benders decomposition with a Lagrangian relaxation method. To improve the decomposition mechanism, a multi-Pareto cut version is applied in the proposed algorithm. In our numerical tests a modification of the well-known CAB data set is used with different levels of parameters uncertainty. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to design a robust network. We also verify the accuracy of the sample average approximation method. Finally, the results of the proposed algorithm for different instances were compared to other solution approaches which confirm the efficiency of the proposed solution method.
