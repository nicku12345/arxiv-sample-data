This paper develops a unified methodology for probabilistic analysis and optimal control design for jump diffusion processes defined by polynomials. For such systems, the evolution of the moments of the state can be described via a system of linear ordinary differential equations. Typically, however, the moments are not closed and an infinite system of equations is required to compute statistical moments exactly. Existing methods for stochastic analysis, known as closure methods, focus on approximating this infinite system of equations with a finite dimensional system. This work develops an alternative approach in which the higher order terms, which are approximated in closure methods, are viewed as inputs to a finite-dimensional linear control system. Under this interpretation, upper and lower bounds of statistical moments can be computed via convex linear optimal control problems with semidefinite constraints. For analysis of steady-state distributions, this optimal control problem reduces to a static semidefinite program. These same optimization problems extend automatically to stochastic optimal control problems. For minimization problems, the methodology leads to guaranteed lower bounds on the true optimal value. Furthermore, we show how an approximate optimal control strategy can be constructed from the solution of the semidefinite program. The results are illustrated using numerous examples.
