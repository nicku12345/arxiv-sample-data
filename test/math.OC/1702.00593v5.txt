Conventionally, methods to solve macroscopic node model are discussed in algorithm or in algebraic point of view. In this paper, the geometric interpretation is discussed, focusing on an example in Flotterod and Rohde (2011). Via observing these diagrams, it is easy to see that deriving holding-free solution (HFS) is not just an ordinary optimisation problem, but rather a Pareto frontier-finding problem.
