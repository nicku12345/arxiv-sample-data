This paper is devoted to a study of infinite horizon optimal control problems with time discounting and time averaging criteria in discrete time. We establish that these problems are related to certain infinite-dimensional linear programming (IDLP) problems. We also establish asymptotic relationships between the optimal values of problems with time discounting and long-run average criteria.
