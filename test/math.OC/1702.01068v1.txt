Power flow in a low voltage direct current grid (LVDC) is a non-linear problem just as its counterpart ac. This paper demonstrates that, unlike in ac grids, convergence and uniqueness of the solution can be guaranteed in this type of grids. The result is not a linearization nor an approximation, but an analysis of the set of non-linear algebraic equations, which is valid for any LVDC grid regardless its size, topology or load condition. Computer simulation corroborate the theoretical analysis.
