We prove necessary optimality conditions of Pontryagin type for a class of fuzzy fractional optimal control problems with the fuzzy fractional derivative described in the Caputo sense. The new results are illustrated by computing the extremals of three fuzzy optimal control systems, which improve recent results of Najariyan and Farahi.
