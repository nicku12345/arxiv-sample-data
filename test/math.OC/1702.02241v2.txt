We introduce a reformulation of regularized low-rank recovery models to take advantage of GPU, multiple CPU, and hybridized architectures. Low-rank recovery often involves nuclear-norm minimization through iterative thresholding of singular values. These models are slow to fit and difficult to parallelize because of their dependence on computing a singular value decomposition at each iteration. Regularized low-rank recovery models also incorporate non-smooth terms to separate structured components (e.g. sparse outliers) from the low-rank component, making these problems more difficult.   Using Burer-Monteiro splitting and marginalization, we develop a smooth, non-convex formulation of regularized low-rank recovery models that can be fit with first-order solvers. We develop a computable certificate of convergence for this non-convex program, and use it to establish bounds on the suboptimality of any point. Using robust principal component analysis (RPCA) as an example, we include numerical experiments showing that this approach is an order-of-magnitude faster than existing RPCA solvers on the GPU. We also show that this acceleration allows new applications for RPCA, including real-time background subtraction and MR image analysis.
