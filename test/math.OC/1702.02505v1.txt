In this paper we study nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems with semi-algebraic data, where the variables vector is split into several blocks of variables. The problem consists of one smooth function of the entire variables vector and the sum of nonsmooth functions for each block separately. We analyze an inertial version of the Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization (PALM) algorithm and prove its global convergence to a critical point of the objective function at hand. We illustrate our theoretical findings by presenting numerical experiments on blind image deconvolution, on sparse non-negative matrix factorization and on dictionary learning, which demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed method.
