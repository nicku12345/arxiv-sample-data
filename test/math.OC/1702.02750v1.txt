This paper studies (single-time and multitime) optimal control problems on a nonholonomic manifold (described either by the kernel of a Gibbs-Pfaff form or by the span of appropriate vector fields). For both descriptions we analyse: infinitesimal deformations and adjointness, single-time optimal control problems, multitime optimal control problem of maximizing a multiple integral functional, multitime optimal control problem of maximizing a curvilinear integral functional, Curvilinear functionals depending on curves, optimization of mechanical work on Riemannian manifolds. Also we prove that a nonholonomic system can be always controlled by uni-temporal or bi-temporal bang-bang controls.
