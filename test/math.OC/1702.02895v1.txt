In this paper, the control problem for underactuated systems in the presence of external disturbances and model uncertainties is considered. An adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller (AFSMC) is proposed to solve the problem, satisfying the robustness properties against uncertainties and disturbances. The designed controller can be applied to a wide class of underactuated systems and have fewer restrictions, compared with many pervious works. To evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, it is applied to an underactuated inverted pendulum and a Translational Oscillator/Rotational Actuator (TORA) system with two degrees of freedom. The simulations are also demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
