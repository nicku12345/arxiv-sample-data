This paper examines distribution systems with a high integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and addresses the design of local control methods for real-time voltage regulation. Particularly, the paper focuses on proportional control strategies where the active and reactive output-powers of DERs are adjusted in response to (and proportionally to) local changes in voltage levels. The design of the voltage-active power and voltage-reactive power characteristics leverages suitable linear approximations of the AC power-flow equations and is network-cognizant; that is, the coefficients of the controllers embed information on the location of the DERs and forecasted non-controllable loads/injections and, consequently, on the effect of DER power adjustments on the overall voltage profile. A robust approach is pursued to cope with uncertainty in the forecasted non-controllable loads/power injections. Stability of the proposed local controllers is analytically assessed and numerically corroborated.
