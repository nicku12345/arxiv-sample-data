We consider a general power market with price-sensitive consumer bids and non-convexities originating from supply (start-up and no-load costs, nonzero minimum output limits of generating units, etc.) and demand. The convex hull (minimum-uplift) pricing method produces the set of power prices that minimizes the total uplift payments to the market players needed to compensate their potential profits lost by accepting the centralized dispatch solution. All opportunities to supply (consume) any other output (consumption) volumes allowed by market player individual operational constraints are considered as foregone in the convex hull pricing method. We modify the convex hull pricing algorithm by defining for each market player a modified individual feasible set that is utilized in the lost profit calculation. These sets are based on the output (consumption) volumes that are economically and technologically feasible in the centralized dispatch. The new pricing method results in the generally different set of market prices and lower (or equal) total uplift payment compared to the convex hull pricing algorithm.
