In this paper we analyze a branching process with immigration defined recursively by X_t=\theta_t\circ X_{t-1}+B_t for a sequence (B_t) of i.i.d. random variables and random mappings  \theta_t\circ x:=\theta_t(x)=\sum_{i=1}^xA_i^{(t)},  with (A_i^{(t)})_{i\in \mathbb{N}_0} being a sequence of \mathbb{N}_0-valued i.i.d. random variables independent of B_t. We assume that one of generic variables A and B has a regularly varying tail distribution. We identify the tail behaviour of the distribution of the stationary solution X_t. We also prove CLT for the partial sums that could be further generalized to FCLT. Finally, we also show that partial maxima have a Fr\'echet limiting distribution.
