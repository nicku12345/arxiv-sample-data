Let M = (M_t)_{t \ge 0} be any continuous real-valued stochastic process such that M_0=0. Chaumont and Vostrikova proved that if there exists a sequence (a_n)_{n \ge 1} of positive real numbers converging to 0 such that M satisfies the reflection principle at levels 0, a_n and 2a_n, for each n \ge 1, then M is an Ocone local martingale. They also asked whether the reflection principle at levels 0 and a_n only (for each n \ge 1) is sufficient to ensure that M is an Ocone local martingale. We give a positive answer to this question, using a slightly different approach, which provides the following intermediate result. Let a and b be two positive real numbers such that a/(a+b) is not dyadic. If M satisfies the reflection principle at the level 0 and at the first passage-time in \{-a,b\}, then M is close to a local martingale in the following sense: |\eef[M_{S \circ M}]| \le a+b for every stopping time S in the canonical filtration of \wwf = \{w \in \CC(\rrf_+,\rrf) : w(0)=0\} such that the stopped process M_{\cdot \wedge (S \circ M)} is uniformly bounded.
