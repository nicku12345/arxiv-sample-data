We consider the long-time behaviour of a branching random walk in random environment on the lattice \Z^d. The migration of particles proceeds according to simple random walk in continuous time, while the medium is given as a random potential of spatially dependent killing/branching rates. The main objects of our interest are the annealed moments < m_n^p > , i.e., the p-th moments over the medium of the n-th moment over the migration and killing/branching, of the local and global population sizes. For n=1, this is well-understood \cite{GM98}, as m_1 is closely connected with the parabolic Anderson model. For some special distributions, \cite{A00} extended this to n\geq2, but only as to the first term of the asymptotics, using (a recursive version of) a Feynman-Kac formula for m_n.   In this work we derive also the second term of the asymptotics, for a much larger class of distributions. In particular, we show that < m_n^p > and < m_1^{np} > are asymptotically equal, up to an error \e^{o(t)}. The cornerstone of our method is a direct Feynman-Kac-type formula for m_n, which we establish using the spine techniques developed in \cite{HR11}.
