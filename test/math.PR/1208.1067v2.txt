The signature of a d-dimensional Brownian motion is a sequence of iterated Stratonovich integrals along the Brownian paths, an object taking values in the tensor algebra over \RR^{d}. In this note, we derive the exact rate of convergence for the expected signatures of piecewise linear approximations to Brownian motion. The computation is based on the identification of the set of words whose coefficients are of the leading order, and the convergence is concentrated on this subset of words. Moreover, under the choice of projective tensor norm, we give the explicit value of the leading term constant.
