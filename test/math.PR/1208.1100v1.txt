Let \Phi:\R\rightarrow\R be an arbitrary continuously differentiable deterministic function such that |\Phi|+|\Phi'| is bounded by a polynomial. In this article we consider the class of stochastic volatility models in which {Z(t)}_{t\in [0,1]}, the logarithm of the price process, is of the form Z(t)=\int_{0}^t \Phi(X(s)) dW(s), where {X(s)}_{s\in[0,1]} denotes an arbitrary centered Gaussian process whose trajectories are, with probability 1, H\"older continuous functions of an arbitrary order \alpha\in (1/2,1], and where {W(s)}_{s\in[0,1]} is a standard Brownian motion independent on {X(s)}_{s\in [0,1]}.   First we show that the critical H\"older regularity of a typical trajectory of {Z(t)}_{t\in[0,1]} is equal to 1/2. Next we provide for such a trajectory an expression as a random series which converges at a geometric rate in any H\"older space of an arbitrary order \gamma<1/2; this expression is obtained through the expansion of the random function s\mapsto \Phi(X(s)) on the Haar basis. Finally, thanks to it, we give an efficient iterative simulation method for {Z(t)}_{t\in[0,1]}.
