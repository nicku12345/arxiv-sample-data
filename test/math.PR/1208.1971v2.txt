We study the variational problem that arises from consideration of large deviations for semimartingale reflected Brownian motion (SRBM) in the positive octant. Due to the difficulty of the general problem, we consider the case in which the SRBM has rotationally symmetric parameters. In this case, we are able to obtain conditions under which the optimal solutions to the variational problem are paths that are gradual (moving through faces of strictly increasing dimension) or that spiral around the boundary of the octant. Furthermore, these results allow us to provide an example for which it can be verified that a spiral path is optimal. For rotationally symmetric SRBM's, our results facilitate the simplification of computational methods for determining optimal solutions to variational problems and give insight into large deviations behavior of these processes.
