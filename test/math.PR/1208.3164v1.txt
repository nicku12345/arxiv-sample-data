The variation of a martingale p_0^k=p_0,...,p_k of probabilities on a finite (or countable) set X is denoted V(p_0^k) and defined by V(p_0^k)=E(\sum_{t=1}^k|p_t-p_{t-1}|_1). It is shown that V(p_0^k)\leq \sqrt{2kH(p_0)}, where H(p) is the entropy function H(p)=-\sum_xp(x)\log p(x) and \log stands for the natural logarithm. Therefore, if d is the number of elements of X, then V(p_0^k)\leq \sqrt{2k\log d}. It is shown that the order of magnitude of the bound \sqrt{2k\log d} is tight for d\leq 2^k: there is C>0 such that for every k and d\leq 2^k there is a martingale p_0^k=p_0,...,p_k of probabilities on a set X with d elements, and with variation V(p_0^k)\geq C\sqrt{2k\log d}. An application of the first result to game theory is that the difference between v_k and \lim_kv_k, where v_k is the value of the k-stage repeated game with incomplete information on one side with d states, is bounded by |G|\sqrt{2k^{-1}\log d} (where |G| is the maximal absolute value of a stage payoff). Furthermore, it is shown that the order of magnitude of this game theory bound is tight.
