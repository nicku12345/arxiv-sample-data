A classical random walk (S_t, t\in\mathbb{N}) is defined by S_t:=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^t X_n, where (X_n) are i.i.d. When the increments (X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} are a one-order Markov chain, a short memory is introduced in the dynamics of (S_t). This so-called "persistent" random walk is nolonger Markovian and, under suitable conditions, the rescaled process converges towards the integrated telegraph noise (ITN) as the time-scale and space-scale parameters tend to zero (see Herrmann and Vallois, 2010; Tapiero-Vallois, Tapiero-Vallois2}). The ITN process is effectively non-Markovian too. The aim is to consider persistent random walks (S_t) whose increments are Markov chains with variable order which can be infinite. This variable memory is enlighted by a one-to-one correspondence between (X_n) and a suitable Variable Length Markov Chain (VLMC), since for a VLMC the dependency from the past can be unbounded.   The key fact is to consider the non Markovian letter process (X_n) as the margin of a couple (X_n,M_n)_{n\ge 0} where (M_n)_{n\ge 0} stands for the memory of the process (X_n). We prove that, under a suitable rescaling, (S_n,X_n,M_n) converges in distribution towards a time continuous process (S^0(t),X(t),M(t)). The process (S^0(t)) is a semi-Markov and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process whose paths are piecewise linear.
