Let \xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots be independent copies of a positive random variable \xi, S_0 = 0, and S_k = \xi_1+\ldots+\xi_k, k \in \mathbb{N}. Define N(t) = \inf\{k \in \mathbb{N}: S_k>t\} for t\geq 0. The process (N(t))_{t\geq 0} is the first-passage time process associated with (S_k)_{k\geq 0}. It is known that if the law of \xi belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law or \mathbb{P}(\xi>t) varies slowly at \infty, then N(t), suitably shifted and scaled, converges in distribution as t \to \infty to a random variable W with a stable law or a Mittag-Leffler law. We investigate whether there is convergence of the power and exponential moments to the corresponding moments of W. Further, the analogous problem for first-passage times of subordinators is considered.
