We prove joint Holder continuity and an occupation-time formula for the self-intersection local time of fractional Brownian motion. Motivated by an occupation-time formula, we also introduce a new version of the derivative of self-intersection local time for fractional Brownian motion and prove Holder conditions for this process. This process is related to a different version of the derivative of self-intersection local time studied by the authors in a previous work.
