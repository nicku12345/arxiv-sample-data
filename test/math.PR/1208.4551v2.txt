The paths of Brownian motion have been widely studied in the recent years relatively in Besov spaces B_{p, \infty}^\a. The results are the same as to the Brownian bridge. In fact these regularities properties are established in some sequence spaces S_{p, \infty}^\a using an isomorphisim between them and B_{p, \infty}^\a.   In this note, we are concerned with the regularity of the paths of the continuous version of the uniform empirical process in the space S_{p, \infty}^\a and in one of his separable sub space S_{p, \infty}^{\a, 0} for a suitable choice of \a and p.
