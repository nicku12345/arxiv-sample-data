In this paper, we establish an oscillation estimate of nonnegative harmonic functions for a pure-jump subordinate Brownian motion. The infinitesimal generator of such subordinate Brownian motion is an integro-differential operator. As an application, we give a probabilistic proof of the following form of relative Fatou theorem for such subordinate Brownian motion X in bounded kappa-fat open set; if u is a positive harmonic function with respect to X in a bounded kappa-fat open set D and h is a positive harmonic function in D vanishing on D^c, then the non-tangential limit of u/h exists almost everywhere with respect to the Martin-representing measure of h.
