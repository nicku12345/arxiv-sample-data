Consider a sequence of possibly random graphs G_N=(V_N, E_N), N\ge 1, whose vertices's have i.i.d. weights \{W^N_x : x\in V_N\} with a distribution belonging to the basin of attraction of an \alpha-stable law, 0<\alpha<1. Let X^N_t, t \ge 0, be a continuous time simple random walk on G_N which waits a \emph{mean} W^N_x exponential time at each vertex x. Under considerably general hypotheses, we prove that in the ergodic time scale this trap model converges in an appropriate topology to a K-process. We apply this result to a class of graphs which includes the hypercube, the d-dimensional torus, d\ge 2, random d-regular graphs and the largest component of super-critical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs.
