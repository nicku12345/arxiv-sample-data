Let \mathbf{B}_n=\mathbf {S}_n(\mathbf {S}_n+\alpha_n\mathbf {T}_N)^{-1}, where \mathbf {S}_n and \mathbf {T}_N are two independent sample covariance matrices with dimension p and sample sizes n and N, respectively. This is the so-called Beta matrix. In this paper, we focus on the limiting spectral distribution function and the central limit theorem of linear spectral statistics of \mathbf {B}_n. Especially, we do not require \mathbf {S}_n or \mathbf {T}_N to be invertible. Namely, we can deal with the case where p>\max\{n,N\} and p<n+N. Therefore, our results cover many important applications which cannot be simply deduced from the corresponding results for multivariate F matrices.
