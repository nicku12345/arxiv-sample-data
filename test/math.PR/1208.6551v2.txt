We study a generalized 1d periodic SPDE of Burgers type:  \partial_t u =- A^\theta u + \partial_x u^2 + A^{\theta/2} \xi  where \theta > 1/2, -A is the 1d Laplacian, \xi is a space-time white noise and the initial condition u_0 is taken to be (space) white noise. We introduce a notion of weak solution for this equation in the stationary setting. For these solutions we point out how the noise provide a regularizing effect allowing to prove existence and suitable estimates when \theta>1/2. When \theta>5/4 we obtain pathwise uniqueness. We discuss the use of the same method to study different approximations of the same equation and for a model of stationary 2d stochastic Navier-Stokes evolution.
