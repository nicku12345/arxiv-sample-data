The lower-dimensional maximal polytopes associated with an iteration stable (STIT) tessellation in \RR^d are considered. They arise in the spatio-temporal construction process of such a tessellation as intersections of (d-1)-dimensional maximal polytopes. A precise description of the joint distribution of their birth-times is obtained. This in turn is used to determine the probabilities that the typical or the length-weighted typical maximal segment of the tessellation contains a fixed number of internal vertices.
