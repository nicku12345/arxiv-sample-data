In the present paper, we prove that the Wasserstein distance on the space of continuous sample-paths equipped with the supremum norm between the laws of a uniformly elliptic one-dimensional diffusion process and its Euler discretization with N steps is smaller than O(N^{-2/3+\varepsilon}) where \varepsilon is an arbitrary positive constant. This rate is intermediate between the strong error estimation in O(N^{-1/2}) obtained when coupling the stochastic differential equation and the Euler scheme with the same Brownian motion and the weak error estimation O(N^{-1}) obtained when comparing the expectations of the same function of the diffusion and of the Euler scheme at the terminal time T. We also check that the supremum over t\in[0,T] of the Wasserstein distance on the space of probability measures on the real line between the laws of the diffusion at time t and the Euler scheme at time t behaves like O(\sqrt{\log(N)}N^{-1}).
