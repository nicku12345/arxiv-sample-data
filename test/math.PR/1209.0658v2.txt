In the paper, stationary measures of stochastic differential equations with jumps are considered. Under some general conditions, existence of stationary measures is proved through Markov measures and Lyapunov functions. Moreover, for two special cases, stationary measures are given by solutions of Fokker-Planck equations and long time limits for the distributions of system states.
