In this article, we prove a new functional limit theorem for the partial sum sequence S_{[nt]}=\sum_{i=1}^{[nt]}X_i corresponding to a linear sequence of the form X_i=\sum_{j \in \bZ}c_j \xi_{i-j} with i.i.d. innovations (\xi_i)_{i \in \bZ} and real-valued coefficients (c_j)_{j \in \bZ}. This weak convergence result is obtained in space \bD[0,1] endowed with the S-topology introduced in Jakubowski (1992), and the limit process is a linear fractional stable motion (LFSM). One of our result provides an extension of the results of Avram and Taqqu (1992) to the case when the coefficients (c_j)_{j \in \bZ} may not have the same sign. The proof of our result relies on the recent criteria for convergence in Skorokhod's M_1-topology (due to Louhichi and Rio (2011)), and a result which connects the weak S-convergence of the sum of two processes with the weak M_1-convergence of the two individual processes. Finally, we illustrate our results using some examples and computer simulations.
