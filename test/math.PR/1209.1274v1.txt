Intermediately subcritical branching processes in random environment are at the borderline between two subcritical regimes and exhibit a particularly rich behavior. In this paper, we prove a functional limit theorem for these processes. It is discussed together with two other recently proved limit theorems for the intermediately subcritical case and illustrated by several computer simulations.
