Let \{A, B, C\} be a partition of a sample space \Omega. For a random walk S_n = x + \sum_{j=1}^n X_j starting at x \in A, we find estimates for the Green's function G_{A \cup B}(x,y) and the hitting time E^x(T_C) for x, y \in A \cup B, with interest in the case where C "separates" A and B in a sense (e.g. the probability of jumping from A to B, or vice versa, before hitting C, is small).
