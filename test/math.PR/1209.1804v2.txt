A permanental field, \psi=\{\psi(\nu),\nu\in {\mathcal{V}}\}, is a particular stochastic process indexed by a space of measures on a set S. It is determined by a kernel u(x,y), x,y\in S, that need not be symmetric and is allowed to be infinite on the diagonal. We show that these fields exist when u(x,y) is a potential density of a transient Markov process X in S. A permanental field \psi can be realized as the limit of a renormalized sum of continuous additive functionals determined by a loop soup of X, which we carefully construct. A Dynkin-type isomorphism theorem is obtained that relates \psi to continuous additive functionals of X (continuous in t), L=\{L_t^{\nu},(\nu ,t)\in {\mathcal{V}}\times R_+\}. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the continuity of L on {\mathcal{V}}\times R_+. The metric on {\mathcal{V}} is given by a proper norm.
