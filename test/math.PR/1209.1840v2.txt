In this paper we treat semilinear stochastic partial differential equations by two methods. First, we extend the framework of [BDR10] from a Hilbert space to a Gelfand triple and as an application we prove the existence of solutions for the Fokker-Planck equations associated to semilinear equations with space-time white noise and both with polynomially growing nonlinearities and Burgers type nonlinearities at the same time. Second we adopt the approximation technique from [BDR10] to obtain existence of unique strong solutions to semilinear stochastic partial differential equations driven by space-time white noise, generalizing corresponding known results from the literature.
