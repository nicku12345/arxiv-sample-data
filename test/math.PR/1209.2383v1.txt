We examine escape and entrance times, Green's functions, local times, and hitting distributions of discs and annuli of a symmetric random walk on \Z^2 projected onto the periodic lattice \Z^2_K. This extends a framework for the simple planar random walk in Dembo, et al. (2006) to the large class of planar random walks in Bass, Rosen (2007). The approach uses comparisons between \Z^2 and \Z^2_K hitting times and distributions on annuli, and uses only random walk methods.
