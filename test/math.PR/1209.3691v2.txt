In 1998, Molloy and Reed showed that, under suitable conditions, if a sequence of degree sequences converges to a probability distribution D, then the size of the largest component in corresponding n-vertex random graph is asymptotically \rho(D)n, where \rho(D) is a constant defined by the solution to certain equations that can be interpreted as the survival probability of a branching process associated to D. There have been a number of papers strengthening this result in various ways; here we prove a strong form of the result (with exponential bounds on the probability of large deviations) under minimal conditions.
