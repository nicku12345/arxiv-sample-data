Semi-Levy process is an additive process with periodically stationary increments. In particular, it is a generalization of Levy process. The dichotomy of recurrence and transience of Levy processes is well known, but this is not necessarily true for general additive processes. In this paper, we prove the recurrence and transience dichotomy of semi-Levy processes. For the proof, we introduce a concept of semi-random walk and discuss its recurrence and transience properties. An example of semi-Levy process constructed from two independent Levy processes is investigated. Finally, we prove the laws of large numbers for semi-Levy processes.
