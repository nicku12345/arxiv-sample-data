We continue our study of the distribution of the maximal number X^{\ast}_k of offsprings amongst all individuals in a critical Galton-Watson process started with k ancestors, treating the case when the reproduction law has a regularly varying tail \bar F with index -\alpha for \alpha>2 (and hence finite variance). We show that X^{\ast}_k suitably normalized converges in distribution to a Frechet law with shape parameter \alpha/2; this contrasts sharply with the case 1<\alpha <2 when the variance is infinite. More generally, we obtain a weak limit theorem for the offspring sequence ranked in the decreasing order, in terms of atoms of a certain doubly stochastic Poisson measure.
