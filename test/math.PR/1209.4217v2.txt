In 1964 R.Gangolli published a L\'{e}vy-Khintchine type formula which characterised K bi-invariant infinitely divisible probability measures on a symmetric space G/K. His main tool was Harish-Chandra's spherical functions which he used to construct a generalisation of the Fourier transform of a measure. In this paper we use generalised spherical functions (or Eisenstein integrals) and extensions of these which we construct using representation theory to obtain such a characterisation for arbitrary infinitely divisible probability measures on a non-compact symmetric space. We consider the example of hyperbolic space in some detail.
