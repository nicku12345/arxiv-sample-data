This paper proves an analogue of a result of Banuelos and Sa Barreto on the asymptotic expansion for the trace of Schrodinger operators on \R^d when the Laplacian \Delta, which is the generator of the Brownian motion, is replaced by the non-local integral operator \Delta^{\alpha/2}, 0<\alpha<2, which is the generator of the symmetric stable process of order \alpha. These results also extend recent results of Banuelos and Yildirim where the first two coefficients for \Delta^{\alpha/2} are computed. Some extensions to Schrodinger operators arising from relativistic stable and mixed stable processes are obtained.
