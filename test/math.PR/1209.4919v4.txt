Let X be a squared Bessel process. Following a Feynman-Kac approach, the Laplace transforms of joint laws of (U, \int_0^{R_y}X_s^p\,ds) are studied where R_y is the first hitting time of y by X and U is a random variable measurable with respect to the history of X until R_y. A subset of these results are then used to solve the associated small ball problems for \int_0^{R_y}X_s^p\,ds and determine a Chung's law of iterated logarithm. (\int_0^{R_y}X_s^p\,ds) is also considered as a purely discontinuous increasing Markov process and its infinitesimal generator is found. The findings are then used to price a class of exotic derivatives on interest rates and determine the asymptotics for the prices of some put options that are only slightly in-the-money.
