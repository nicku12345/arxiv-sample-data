We consider a model of loop-erased random walks on the finite pre-Sierpinski gasket which permits rigorous analysis. We prove the existence of the scaling limit and show that the path of the limiting process is almost surely self-avoiding, while having Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than 1. This result means that the path has infinitely fine creases, while having no self-intersection. Our loop-erasing procedure is formulated by a `larger-scale-loops-first' rule. It enables us to obtain exact recursion relations, making use of `self-similarity' of a fractal structure.
