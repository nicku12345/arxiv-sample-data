Let C be a real-valued M\times M matrix with singular values \lambda_1\ge...\ge\lambda_M and E a random matrix of centered i.i.d. entries with finite fourth moment. In this paper we give a universal upper bound on the expectation of ||\hat\pi_rX||_{S_2}^2-||\pi_rX||^2_{S_2}, where X:=C+E and \hat\pi_r (resp. \pi_r) is a rank-r projection maximizing the Hilbert-Schmidt norm ||\tilde\pi_rX||_{S_2} (resp. ||\tilde\pi_rC||_{S_2}) over the set \S_{M,r} of all orthogonal rank-r projections. This result is a generalization of a theorem for Gaussian matrices due to Rohde (2012). Our approach differs substantially from the techniques of the mentioned article. We analyze ||\hat\pi_rX||_{S_2}^2-||\pi_rX||^2_{S_2} from a rather deterministic point of view by an upper bound on ||\hat\pi_rX||_{S_2}^2-||\pi_rX||^2_{S_2}, whose randomness is totally determined by the largest singular value of E.
