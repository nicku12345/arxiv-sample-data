Universality properties of the distribution of the generalized eigenvalues of a pencil of random Hankel matrices, arising in the solution of the exponential interpolation problem of a complex discrete stationary process, are proved under the assumption that every finite set of random variables of the process have a multivariate spherical distribution. An integral representation of the condensed density of the generalized eigenvalues is also derived. The asymptotic behavior of this function turns out to depend only on stationarity and not on the specific distribution of the process.
