It is well-known that the maximal particle in a branching Brownian motion sits near \sqrt2 t - \frac{3}{2\sqrt2}\log t at time t. One may then ask about the paths of particles near the frontier: how close can they stay to this critical curve? Two different approaches to this question have been developed. We improve upon the best-known bounds in each case, revealing new qualitative features including marked differences between the two approaches.
