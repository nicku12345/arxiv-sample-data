We study a one-dimensional random walk among random conductances, with unbounded jumps. Assuming the ergodicity of the collection of conductances and a few other technical conditions (uniform ellipticity and polynomial bounds on the tails of the jumps) we prove a quenched conditional invariance principle for the random walk, under the condition that it remains positive until time n. As a corollary of this result, we study the effect of conditioning the random walk to exceed level n before returning to 0 as n\to \infty.
