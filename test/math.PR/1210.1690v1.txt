This is a preliminary announcement of results in the PhD. thesis of the first author concerning the nonlinear stochastic heat equation in the spatial domain \R, driven by space-time white noise. A central special case is the parabolic Anderson model. The initial condition is taken to be a measure on \R, such as the Dirac delta function, but this measure may also have non-compact support and even be non-tempered (for instance with exponentially growing tails). Existence and uniqueness is proved without appealing to Gronwall's lemma, by keeping tight control over moments in the Picard iteration scheme. Upper and lower bounds on all p-th moments (p\ge 2) are obtained. These bounds become equalities for the parabolic Anderson model when p=2. The growth indices introduced by Conus and Khoshnevisan (2010) are determined and, despite the irregular initial conditions, H\"older continuity of the solution for t>0 is established.
