We study the path properties of a random polymer attracted to a defect line by a potential with disorder, and we prove that in the delocalized regime, at any temperature, the number of contacts with the defect line remains in a certain sense "tight in probability" as the polymer length varies. On the other hand we show that at sufficiently low temperature, there exists a.s. a subsequence where the number of contacts grows like the log of the length of the polymer.
