We deal with the 3D inviscid Leray-{\alpha} model. The well posedness for this problem is not known; by adding a random perturbation we prove that there exists a unique (in law) global solution. The random forcing term formally preserves conservation of energy. The result holds for initial velocity of finite energy and the solution has finite energy a.s.. These results are easily extended to the 2D case.
