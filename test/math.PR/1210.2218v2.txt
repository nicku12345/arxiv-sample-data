For certain subordinators (X_t)_{t\ge 0} it is shown that the process (-t\log X_{ts})_{s>0} tends to an extremal process (\hat\eta_s)_{s>0} in the sense of convergence of the finite dimensional distributions. Additionally it is also shown that (z\wedge(-t\log X_{ts}))_{s\ge 0} converges weakly to (z\wedge\hat\eta_s)_{s\ge0} in \mathcal{D}[0,\infty), the space of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions equipped with Skorohod's J_1 metric.
