We recall four open problems concerning constructing high-order matrix-exponential approximations for the infimum of a spectrally negative Levy process (with applications to first-passage/ruin probabilities, the waiting time distribution in the M/G/1 queue, pricing of barrier options, etc). On the way, we provide a new approximation, for the perturbed Cramer-Lundberg model, and recall a remarkable family of (not minimal order) approximations of Johnson and Taaffe, which fit an arbitrarily high number of moments, greatly generalizing the currently used approximations of Renyi, De Vylder and Whitt-Ramsay. Obtaining such approximations which fit the Laplace transform at infinity as well would be quite useful.
