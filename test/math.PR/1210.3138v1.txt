We study an approximation by time-discretized geodesic random walks of a diffusion process associated with a family of time-dependent metrics on manifolds. The condition we assume on the metrics is a natural time-inhomogeneous extension of lower Ricci curvature bounds. In particular, it includes the case of backward Ricci flow, and no further a priori curvature bound is required. As an application, we construct a coupling by reflection which yields a nice estimate of coupling time, and hence a gradient estimate for the associated semigroups.
