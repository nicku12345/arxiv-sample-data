The (\Xi, A)-Fleming-Viot process with mutation is a probability-measure-valued process whose moment dual is similar to that of the classical Fleming-Viot process except that the Kingman's coalescent is replaced by the \Xi-coalescent, the coalescent with simultaneous multiple collisions. We first prove the existence of such a process for general mutation generator A. We then investigate its reversibility. We also study both the weak and strong uniqueness of solution to the associated stochastic partial differential equation.
