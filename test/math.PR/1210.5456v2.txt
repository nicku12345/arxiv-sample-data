TThe prototypical problem we study here is the following. Given a 2L\times 2L square, there are approximately \exp(4KL^2/\pi ) ways to tile it with dominos, i.e. with horizontal or vertical 2\times 1 rectangles, where K\approx 0.916 is Catalan's constant [Kasteleyn '61, Temperley-Fisher '61]. A conceptually simple (even if computationally not the most efficient) way of sampling uniformly one among so many tilings is to introduce a Markov Chain algorithm (Glauber dynamics) where, with rate 1, two adjacent horizontal dominos are flipped to vertical dominos, or vice-versa. The unique invariant measure is the uniform one and a classical question [Wilson 2004,Luby-Randall-Sinclair 2001] is to estimate the time T_{mix} it takes to approach equilibrium (i.e. the running time of the algorithm). In [Luby-Randall-Sinclair 2001, Randall-Tetali 2000], fast mixin was proven: T_{mix}=O(L^C) for some finite C. Here, we go much beyond and show that c L^2\le T_{mix}\le L^{2+o(1)}. Our result applies to rather general domain shapes (not just the 2L\times 2L square), provided that the typical height function associated to the tiling is macroscopically planar in the large L limit, under the uniform measure (this is the case for instance for the Temperley-type boundary conditions considered in [Kenyon 2000]). Also, our method extends to some other types of tilings of the plane, for instance the tilings associated to dimer coverings of the hexagon or square-hexagon lattices.
