We consider a Gaussian field X = \{X_t, t \in T\} with values in a Banach space B defined on a parametric set T equal to R^m or Z^m. It is supposed that the distribution \cal P of X_t is independent of t. We consider the asymptotic behavior of closed convex hulls  W_n = \conv \{X_t, t \in T_n\}  where (T_n) is an increasing sequence of subsets of T and we show that under some conditions of the weak dependence with probability 1  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{b_n}\,W_n = {\cal E}  (in the sense of Hausdorff distance), where the limit shape {\cal E} is the concentration ellipsoid of \cal P.   The asymptotic behavior of the mathematical expectations Ef(W_n), where f is an homogeneous function is also studied.
