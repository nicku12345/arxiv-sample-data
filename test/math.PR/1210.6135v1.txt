Random walks in random scenery are processes defined by Z_n:=\sum_{k=1}^n\omega_{S_k} where S:=(S_k,k\ge 0) is a random walk evolving in \mathbb{Z}^d and \omega:=(\omega_x, x\in{\mathbb Z}^d) is a sequence of i.i.d. real random variables. Under suitable assumptions on the random walk S and the random scenery \omega, almost surely with respect to \omega, the correctly renormalized sequence (Z_n)_{n\geq 1} is proved to converge in distribution to a centered Gaussian law with explicit variance.
