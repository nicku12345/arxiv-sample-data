We study the random walk X on the range of a simple random walk on \mathbb{Z}^d in dimensions d\geq 4. When d\geq 5 we establish quenched and annealed scaling limits for the process X, which show that the intersections of the original simple random walk path are essentially unimportant. For d=4 our results are less precise, but we are able to show that any scaling limit for X will require logarithmic corrections to the polynomial scaling factors seen in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when d=4 similar logarithmic corrections are necessary in describing the asymptotic behaviour of the return probability of X to the origin.
