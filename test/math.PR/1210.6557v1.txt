Albert-Laszlo Barabasi introduced a model which exhibits the bursty nature of the arrival times of events in systems determined by decisions of some humans. In Barabasi's model tasks are selected to execution according to some rules which depends on the priorities of the tasks. In this paper we generalize the selection rule of the A.-L. Barabasi priority queuing model. We show that the bursty nature of human behavior can be explained by a model where tasks are selected proportional to their priorities. In addition, we extend some of Vazquez's heuristic arguments to analytic proofs.
