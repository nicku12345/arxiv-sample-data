We consider a model for a one-sided limit order book proposed by Lakner et al. We show that it can be coupled with a branching random walk and use this coupling to answer a non-trivial question about the long-term behavior of the price. The coupling relies on a classical idea of enriching the state-space by artificially creating a filiation, in this context between orders of the book, that we believe has the potential of being useful for a broader class of models.
