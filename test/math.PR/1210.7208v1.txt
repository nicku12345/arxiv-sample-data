In this paper we study the effect of stochastic perturbations on a common type of moving boundary value PDE's which endorse Stefan boundary conditions, or Stefan problems, and show the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to a number of stochastic equations of this kind. Moreover we also derive the space and time regularities of the solutions and the associated boundaries via Kolmogorov's Continuity Theorem in an appropriately defined normed space.   The paper first conveys our previous results where randomness is smoothly correlated in space and Brownian in time, then introduces a new methodology that enables us to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the standard heat equation driven by a space-time Brownian sheet as well as its boundary regularity, and finally extends it to the stochastic moving boundary partial PDE's driven by the same type of randomness.
