We study the decay of convolution powers of probability measures without second moment but satisfying some weaker finite moment condition. For any locally compact unimodular group G and any positive function \rho:G \rightarrow [0,+\infty], we introduce a function \Phi_{G,\rho} which describes the fastest possible decay of n \mapsto \phi^{(2n)}(e) when \phi is a symmetric continuous probability density such that \int\rho\phi is finite. We estimate \Phi_{G,\rho} for a variety of groups G and functions \rho. When \rho is of the form \rho=\rho \circ \delta with \rho:[0,+\infty) \rightarrow [0,+\infty), a fixed increasing function, and \delta:G \rightarrow [0,+\infty), a natural word length measuring the distance to the identity element in G, \Phi_{G,\rho} can be thought of as a group invariant.
