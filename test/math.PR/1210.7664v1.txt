Consider two random walks on \mathbb{Z}. The transition probabilities of each walk is dependent on trajectory of the other walker i.e. a drift p>1/2 is obtained in a position the other walker visited twice or more. This simple model has a speed which is, according to simulations, not monotone in p, without apparent "trap" behaviour. In this paper we prove the process has positive speed for 1/2<p<1, and present a deterministic algorithm to approximate the speed and show the non-monotonicity.
