We consider some random band matrices with band-width N^\mu whose entries are independent random variables with distribution tail in x^{-\alpha}. We consider the largest eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors and prove the following phase transition. On the one hand, when \alpha\textless{}2(1+\mu^{-1}), the largest eigenvalues have order N^{(1+\mu)/\alpha}, are asymptotically distributed as a Poisson process and their associated eigenvectors are essentially carried by two coordinates (this phenomenon has already been remarked by Soshnikov for full matrices with heavy tailed entries,i.e. when \alpha\textless{}2, and by Auffinger, Ben Arous and P{\'e}ch{\'e} when \alpha\textless{}4). On the other hand, when \alpha\textgreater{}2(1+\mu^{-1}), the largest eigenvalues have order N^{\mu/2} and most eigenvectors of the matrix are delocalized, i.e. approximately uniformly distributed on their N coordinates.
