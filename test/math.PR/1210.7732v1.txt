We consider solutions of the stochastic equation X \stackrel{d}= \sum_{i=1}^N A_iX_i + B, where N is a random natural number, B and A_i are random positive numbers and X_i are independent copies of X, which are independent also of N,B,A_i. Properties of solutions of this equation are mainly coded in the function m(s)=\mathbb{E}\big[\sum_{i=1}^N A_i^s \big]. In this paper we study the critical case when the function m is tangent to the line y=1. Then, under a number of further assumptions, we prove existence of solutions and describe their asymptotic behavior.
