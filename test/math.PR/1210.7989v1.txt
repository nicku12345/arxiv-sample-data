In the present paper, we study an explicit effect of non-symmetry on asymptotics of the n-step transition probability as n\rightarrow \infty for a class of non-symmetric random walks on the triangular lattice. Realizing the triangular lattice into \mathbb{R}^2 appropriately, we observe that the Euclidean distance in \mathbb{R}^2 naturally appears in the asymptotics. We characterize this realization from a geometric view point of Kotani-Sunada's standard realization of crystal lattices. As a corollary of the main theorem, we prove that the transition semigroup generated by the non-symmetric random walk approximates the heat semigroup generated by the usual Brownian motion on \mathbb{R}^2.
