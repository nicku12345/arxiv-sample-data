A multidimensional Brownian motion with partial reflection on a hyperplane S in the direction qN+\alpha , where N is the conormal vector to the hyperplane and q\in [-1,1], \alpha \in S are given parametres, is constructed and this construction is based on both analytic and probabilistic approaches. The joint distribution of d-dimensional analogy to skew Brownian motion and its local time on the hyperplane is obtained.
