In this article, we consider the speed of the random walks in a (uniformly elliptic and i.i.d.) random environment (RWRE) under perturbation. We obtain the derivative of the speed of the RWRE w.r.t. the perturbation, under the assumption that one of the following holds: (i) the environment is balanced and the perturbation satisfies a Kalikow-type ballisticity condition, (ii) the environment satisfies Sznitman's ballisticity condition. This is a generalized version of the Einstein relation for RWRE. Our argument is based on a modification of Lebowitz-Rost's argument developed in [Stochastic Process. Appl. 54 (1994) 183-196] and a new regeneration structure for the perturbed balanced environment.
