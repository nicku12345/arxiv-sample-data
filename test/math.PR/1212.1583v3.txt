We consider shot noise processes (X(t))_{t \geq 0} with deterministic response function h and the shots occurring at the renewal epochs 0= S_0 < S_1 < S_2 ... of a zero-delayed renewal process. We prove convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of (X(ut))_{u \geq 0} as t \to \infty in different regimes. If the response function h is directly Riemann integrable, then the finite-dimensional distributions of (X(ut))_{u \geq 0} converge weakly as t \to \infty. Neither scaling nor centering are needed in this case. If the response function is eventually decreasing, non-integrable with an integrable power, then, after suitable shifting, the finite-dimensional distributions of the process converge. Again, no scaling is needed. In both cases, the limit is identified. If the distribution of S_1 is in the domain of attraction of an \alpha-stable law and the response function is regularly varying at \infty with index \beta (with \beta < 1/\alpha or \beta \leq 1/\alpha, depending on whether \mathbb{E} S_1 < \infty or \mathbb{E} S_1 = \infty), then scaling is needed to obtain weak convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of (X(ut))_{u \geq 0}. The limiting processes are fractionally integrated stable L\'{e}vy motions if \mathbb{E} S_1 < \infty and fractionally integrated inverse stable subordinators if \mathbb{E} S_1 = \infty.
