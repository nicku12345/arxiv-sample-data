This paper studies concentration inequalities for functions of locally dependent random variables. We show that the usual definition of local dependence does not imply concentration for general Hamming Lipschitz functions. We define hypergraph dependence, which is a special case of local dependence, and show that it implies concentration if the maximal neighborhood size is small. We prove concentration in Hamming distance, Talagrand distance, and for self-bounding functions of a particular type under this dependence structure.
