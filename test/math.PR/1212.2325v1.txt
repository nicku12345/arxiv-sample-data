In this paper, we consider a long-time behavior of stable-like processes. A stable-like process is a Feller process given by the symbol p(x,\xi)=-i\beta(x)\xi+\gamma(x)|\xi|^{\alpha(x)}, where \alpha(x)\in(0,2), \beta(x)\in\R and \gamma(x)\in(0,\infty). More precisely, we give sufficient conditions for recurrence, transience and ergodicity of stable-like processes in terms of the stability function \alpha(x), the drift function \beta(x) and the scaling function \gamma(x). Further, as a special case of these results we give a new proof for the recurrence and transience property of one-dimensional symmetric stable L\'{e}vy processes with the index of stability \alpha\neq1.
