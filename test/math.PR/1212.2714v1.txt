We consider the probability that a two-dimensional random walk starting from the origin never returns to the half-line  (- \infty,0] \times {0} before time n. Let X^{(1)}=(X_{1},X_{2}) be the increment of the two-dimensional random walk. For an aperiodic random walk with moment conditions (E[X_{2}]=0  and  E[|X_{1}|^{\delta}]<\infty, E[|X_{2}|^{2+ \delta}]< \infty  for some  \delta \in (0,1)), we obtain an asymptotic estimate (as n \rightarrow \infty ) of this probability by assuming the behavior of the characteristic function of X_{1} near zero.
