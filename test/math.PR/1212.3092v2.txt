In this paper, we consider a large class of subordinate Brownian motions X via subordinators with Laplace exponents which are complete Bernstein functions satisfying some mild scaling conditions at zero and at infinity. We first discuss how such conditions govern the behavior of the subordinator and the corresponding subordinate Brownian motion for both large and small time and space. Then we establish a global uniform boundary Harnack principle in (unbounded) open sets for the subordinate Brownian motion. When the open set satisfies the interior and exterior ball conditions with radius R >0, we get a global uniform boundary Harnack principle with explicit decay rate. Our boundary Harnack principle is global in the sense that it holds for all R>0 and the comparison constants do not depend on R, and it is uniform in the sense that it holds for all balls with radii r \le R and the comparison constants depend neither on D nor on r. As an application, we give sharp two-sided estimates for the transition density and the Green function of such subordinate Brownian motions in the half-space.
