We study class of L\'{e}vy processes having distributions being indentifiable by moments. We define system of polynomial martingales \newline \left\{ M_{n}(X_{t},t),\mathcal{F}_{\leq t}\right\} _{n\geq 1}, where % \mathcal{F}_{\leq t} is a suitable filtration defined below. We present several properties of these martingales. Among others we show that % M_{1}(X_{t},t)/t is a reversed martingale as well as a harness. Main results of the paper concern the question if martingale say M_{i} multiplied by suitable determinstic function \mu _{i}(t) is a reversed martingale. We show that for n\geq 3 M_{n}(X_{t},t) is a reversed martingale (or orthogonal polynomial) only when the L\'{e}vy process in question is Gaussian (i.e. is a Wiener process). We study also a more general question if there are chances for a linear combination (with coefficients depending on t) of martingales M_{i}, i\allowbreak =\allowbreak 1,\ldots ,n to be reversed martingales. We analyze case % n\allowbreak =\allowbreak 2 in detail listing all possible cases.
