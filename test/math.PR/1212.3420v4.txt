We consider the L_2-regularity of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with Lipschitz generators driven by a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure associated with a L\'{e}vy process (X_t)_{t\in[0,T]}. The terminal condition may be a Borel function of finitely many increments of the L\'{e}vy process which is not necessarily Lipschitz but only satisfies a fractional smoothness condition. The results are obtained by investigating how the special structure appearing in the chaos expansion of the terminal condition is inherited by the solution to the BSDE.
