We introduce ellipticity criteria for random walks in i.i.d. random environments under which we can extend the ballisticity conditions of Sznitman's and the polynomial effective criteria of Berger, Drewitz and Ramirez originally defined for uniformly elliptic random walks. We prove under them the equivalence of Sznitman's (T') condition with the polynomial effective criterion (P)_M, for M large enough. We furthermore give ellipticity criteria under which a random walk satisfying the polynomial effective criterion, is ballistic, satisfies the annealed central limit theorem or the quenched central limit theorem.
