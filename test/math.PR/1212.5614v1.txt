For any distribution \pi with support equal to [n] = \{1, 2,..., n \}, we study the set \mathcal{A}_{\pi} of tridiagonal stochastic matrices K satisfying \pi(i) K[i,j] = \pi(j) K[j,i] for all i, j \in [n]. These matrices correspond to birth and death chains with stationary distribution \pi. We study matrices K drawn uniformly from \mathcal{A}_{\pi}, following the work of Diaconis and Wood on the case \pi(i) = \frac{1}{n}. We analyze a `block sampler' version of their algorithm for drawing from \mathcal{A}_{\pi} at random, and use results from this analysis to draw conclusions about typical matrices. The main result is a soft argument comparing cutoff for sequences of random birth and death chains to cutoff for a special family of birth and death chains with the same stationary distributions.
