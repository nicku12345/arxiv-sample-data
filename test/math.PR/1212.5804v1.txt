We study a reaction-diffusion evolution equation perturbed by a space-time L\'evy noise. The associated Kolmogorov operator is the sum of the infinitesimal generator of a C_0-semigroup of strictly negative type acting in a Hilbert space and a nonlinear term which has at most polynomial growth, is non necessarily Lipschitz and is such that the whole system is dissipative.   The corresponding It\^o stochastic equation describes a process on a Hilbert space with dissi- pative nonlinear, non globally Lipschitz drift and a L\'evy noise. Under smoothness assumptions on the non-linearity, asymptotics to all orders in a small parameter in front of the noise are given, with detailed estimates on the remainders.   Applications to nonlinear SPDEs with a linear term in the drift given by a Laplacian in a bounded domain are included. As a particular case we provide the small noise asymptotic expansions for the SPDE equations of FitzHugh Nagumo type in neurobiology with external impulsive noise.
