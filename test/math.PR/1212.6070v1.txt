For 1<\alpha <2 we derive the asymptotic distribution of the total length of {\em external} branches of a Beta(2-\alpha, \alpha)-coalescent as the number n of leaves becomes large. It turns out the fluctuations of the external branch length follow those of \tau_n^{2-\alpha} over the entire parameter regime, where \tau_n denotes the random number of coalescences that bring the n lineages down to one. This is in contrast to the fluctuation behavior of the total branch length, which exhibits a transition at \alpha_0 = (1+\sqrt 5)/2.
