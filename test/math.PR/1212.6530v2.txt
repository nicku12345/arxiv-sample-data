We consider the optimal quantization problem with R\'enyi-\alpha-entropy constraints for centered Gaussian measures on a separable Banach space. For \alpha = \infty we can compute the optimal quantization error by a moment on a ball. For \alpha \in {}]1,\infty] and large entropy bound we derive sharp asymptotics for the optimal quantization error in terms of the small ball probability of the Gaussian measure. We apply our results to several classes of Gaussian measures. The asymptotical order of the optimal quantization error for \alpha > 1 is different from the well-known cases \alpha = 0 and \alpha = 1.
