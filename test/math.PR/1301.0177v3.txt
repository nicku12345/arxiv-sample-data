We consider the ground state \phi_0 of the Schr\"odinger operator L=-\Delta+V on the bounded convex domain \Omega\subset\R^n, satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition. Assume that V\in C^1(\Omega) and it admits an even function \tilde V\in C^1([-D/2,D/2]) as its modulus of convexity, where D is the diameter of \Omega. If the first Dirichlet eigenvalue \tilde\lambda_0 of -\frac{\d^2}{\d t^2}+\tilde V on the interval [-D/2,D/2] satisfies \tilde\lambda_0>\tilde V(0), then the measure \d\mu=\phi_0 \d x satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality on \Omega with the constant \tilde\lambda_0-\tilde V(0). In particular, if V is convex, then the constant is explicitly given by \frac{\pi^2}{D^2}.
