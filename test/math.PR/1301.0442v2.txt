In this paper, we consider a class of multi-dimensional stochastic delay differential equations with jump reflection. Based on existence and uniqueness of the strong solution to the equation, we prove that the Markov semigroup generated by the segment process corresponding to the solution admits a unique invariant measure on the Skorohod space when the coefficients of equation satisfy a class of monotone conditions. Finally, we establish a relationship between the regulator and the local time of the solution and discuss a local time property at large time under the stationary setting.
