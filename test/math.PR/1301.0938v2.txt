In this work, we consider symmetric random Toeplitz matrices T_n generated by i.i.d. zero mean random variables {X_k} satisfying the moment conditions: E|X_k|^2=1 and \E|X_1|^n \le n^{\sqrt{n}} for all n\ge 3. We prove that the largest eigenvalue of T_n scaled by \sqrt{n log(n)} converges almost surely to 1.
