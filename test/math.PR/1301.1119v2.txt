In this paper, we assume that the filtration \bb F is generated by a d-dimensional Brownian motion W=(W_1,\cdots,W_d)' as well as an integer-valued random measure \mu(du,dy). The random variable \ttau is the default time and L is the default loss. Let \mathbb G=\{\scr G_t;t\geq 0\} be the progressive enlargement of \bb F by (\ttau,L), i.e, \bb G is the smallest filtration including \bb F such that \ttau is a \bb G-stopping time and L is \scr G_\ttau-measurable. We parameterize the conditional density process, which allows us to describe the survival process G explicitly. We also obtain the explicit \bb G-decomposition of a \bb F martingale and the predictable representation theorem for a (P,\bb G)-martingale by all known parameters. Formula parametrization in the enlarged filtration is a useful quality in financial modeling.
