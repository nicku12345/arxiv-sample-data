We establish a moderate deviations principle (MDP) for the log-determinant \log | \det (M_n) | of a Wigner matrix M_n matching four moments with either the GUE or GOE ensemble. Further we establish Cram\'er--type moderate deviations and Berry-Esseen bounds for the log-determinant for the GUE and GOE ensembles as well as for non-symmetric and non-Hermitian Gaussian random matrices (Ginibre ensembles), respectively.
