Exponential functionals of L\'evy processes appear as stationary distributions of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (GOU) processes. In this paper we obtain the infinitesimal generator of the GOU process and show that it is a Feller process. Further we use these results to investigate properties of the mapping \Phi, which maps two independent L\'evy processes to their corresponding exponential functional, where one of the processes is assumed to be fixed. We show that in many cases this mapping is injective and give the inverse mapping in terms of (L\'evy) characteristics. Also, continuity of \Phi is treated and some results on its range are obtained.
