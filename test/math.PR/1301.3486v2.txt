We identify the scaling limit of the backbone of the high-dimensional incipient infinite cluster (IIC), both in the long- as well as in the finite-range setting. In the finite-range setting, this scaling limit is Brownian motion, in the long-range setting, it is a stable motion. The proof relies on a novel lace expansion for percolation that resembles the original expansion for self-avoiding walks by Brydges and Spencer in 1985. This expansion is interesting in its own right.
