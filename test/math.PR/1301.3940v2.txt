We consider large Information-Plus-Noise type matrices of the form M_N=(\sigma \frac{X_N}{\sqrt{N}}+A_N)(\sigma \frac{X_N}{\sqrt{N}}+A_N)^* where X_N is an n \times N (n\leq N) matrix consisting of independent standardized complex entries, A_N is an n \times N nonrandom matrix and \sigma>0. As N tends to infinity, if n/N \rightarrow c\in ]0,1] and if the empirical spectral measure of A_N A_N^* converges weakly to some compactly supported probability distribution \nu \neq \delta_0, Dozier and Silverstein established that almost surely the empirical spectral measure of M_N converges weakly towards a nonrandom distribution \mu_{\sigma,\nu,c}. Bai and Silverstein proved, under certain assumptions on the model, that for some closed interval in ]0;+\infty[ outside the support of \mu_{\sigma,\nu,c} satisfying some conditions involving A_N, almost surely, no eigenvalues of M_N will appear in this interval for all N large. In this paper, we carry on with the study of the support of the limiting spectral measure previously investigated by Dozier and Silverstein and later by Vallet, Loubaton and Mestre and Loubaton and P. Vallet, and we show that, under almost the same assumptions as Bai and Silvertein, there is an exact separation phenomenon between the spectrum of M_N and the spectrum of A_NA_N^*: to a gap in the spectrum of M_N pointed out by Bai and Silverstein, it corresponds a gap in the spectrum of A_NA_N^* which splits the spectrum of A_NA_N^* exactly as that of M_N. We use the previous results to characterize the outliers of spiked Information-Plus-Noise type models.
