Denote by L_n the length of the perimeter of the convex hull of n steps of a planar random walk whose increments have finite second moment and non-zero mean. Snyder and Steele showed that n^{-1} L_n converges almost surely to a deterministic limit, and proved an upper bound on the variance Var [ L_n] = O(n). We show that n^{-1} Var [L_n] converges and give a simple expression for the limit, which is non-zero for walks outside a certain degenerate class. This answers a question of Snyder and Steele. Furthermore, we prove a central limit theorem for L_n in the non-degenerate case.
