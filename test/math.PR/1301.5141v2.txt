By means of the Malliavin calculus, integral representations for the likelihood function and for the derivative of the log-likelihood function are given for a model based on discrete time observations of the solution to equation dX_t=a_\theta(X_t)dt + dZ_t with a tempered \alpha-stable process Z. Using these representations, regularity of the statistical experiment and the Cramer-Rao inequality are proved.
