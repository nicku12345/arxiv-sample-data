The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution of a continuous homopolymer in the presence of an attractive finitely supported potential. The most intricate behavior can be observed if we simultaneously vary two parameters: the temperature, which approaches the critical value, and the length of the polymer, which tends to infinity. As the main result, we identify the distributions that appear in the limit (after a diffusive scaling of the original polymer measures) and depend on the relation between the two parameters.
