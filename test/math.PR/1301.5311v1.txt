We study Bernoulli percolations on random lattices of the half-plane obtained as local limit of uniform planar triangulations or quadrangulations. Using the characteristic spatial Markov property or peeling process of these random lattices we prove a surprisingly simple universal formula for the critical threshold for bond and face percolations on these graphs. Our techniques also permit us to compute off-critical and critical exponents related to percolation clusters such as the volume and the perimeter.
