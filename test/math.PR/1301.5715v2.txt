This article focuses on a new concept of quadratic variation for processes taking values in a Banach space B and a corresponding covariation. This is more general than the classical one of M\'etivier and Pellaumail. Those notions are associated with some subspace \chi of the dual of the projective tensor product of B with itself. We also introduce the notion of a convolution type process, which is a natural generalization of the It\^o process and the concept of \bar \nu_0-semimartingale, which is a natural extension of the classical notion of semimartingale. The framework is the stochastic calculus via regularization in Banach spaces. Two main applications are mentioned: one related to Clark-Ocone formula for finite quadratic variation processes; the second one concerns the probabilistic representation of a Hilbert valued partial differential equation of Kolmogorov type.
