We prove error bounds in a central limit theorem for solutions of certain convolution equations. The main motivation for investigating these equations stems from applications to lace expansions, in particular to weakly self-avoiding random walks in high dimensions. As an application we treat such self-avoiding walks in continuous space. The bounds obtained are sharper than the ones obtained by other methods.
