The paper is concerned with a class of two-sided stochastic processes of the form X=W+A. Here W is a two-sided Brownian motion with random initial data at time zero and A\equiv A(W) is a function of W. Elements of the related stochastic calculus are introduced. In particular, the calculus is adjusted to the case when A is a jump process. Absolute continuity of (X,P_{\sbnu}) under time shift of trajectories is investigated. For example under various conditions on the initial density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, m=d\bnu/dx, and on A with A_0=0 we verify % {eqnarray*} \frac{P_{\sbnu}(dX_{\cdot -t})}{P_{\sbnu}(dX_\cdot)}=\frac{m(X_{-t})} {m(X_0)}\cdot\prod_i|\nabla_{W_0}X_{-t}|_i {eqnarray*} % a.e. where the product is taken over all coordinates. Here \sum_i(\nabla_{W_0}X_{-t})_i is the divergence of X_{-t} with respect to the initial position. Crucial for this is the {\it temporal homogeneity} in the sense that X(W_{\cdot +v}+A_v\1)=X_{\cdot+v}(W), v\in {\Bbb R}, where A_v\1 is the trajectory taking the constant value A_v (W).   By means of such a density, partial integration relative to the generator of the process X is established. Relative compactness of sequences of such processes is established.
