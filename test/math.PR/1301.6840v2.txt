We consider a supercritical Galton-Watson branching process with immigration. It is well known that under suitable conditions on the offspring and immigration distributions, there is a finite, strictly positive limit {\mathcal{W}} for the normalized population size. Small value probabilities for {\mathcal{W}} are obtained. Precise effects of the balance between offspring and immigration distributions are characterized.
