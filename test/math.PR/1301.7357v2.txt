Let X_{t} and Y_{t} be two Markov chains, on state spaces \Omega \subset \hat{\Omega}. In this paper, we discuss how to prove bounds on the spectrum of X_{t} based on bounds on the spectrum of Y_{t}. This generalizes work of Diaconis, Saloff-Coste, Yuen and others on comparison of chains in the case \Omega = \hat{\Omega}. The main tool is the extension of functions from the smaller space to the larger, which allows comparison of the entire spectrum of the two chains. The theory is used to give quick analyses of several chains without symmetry. The main application is to a `random transposition' walk on derangements.
