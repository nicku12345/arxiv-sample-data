We analyze the optimal dividend payment problem in the dual model under constant transaction costs. We show, for a general spectrally positive L\'{e}vy process, an optimal strategy is given by a (c_1,c_2)-policy that brings the surplus process down to c_1 whenever it reaches or exceeds c_2 for some 0 \leq c_1 < c_2. The value function is succinctly expressed in terms of the scale function. A series of numerical examples are provided to confirm the analytical results and to demonstrate the convergence to the no-transaction cost case, which was recently solved by Bayraktar et al. (2013).
