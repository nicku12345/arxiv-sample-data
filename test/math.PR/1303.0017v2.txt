The strong convergence of Euler approximations of stochastic delay differential equations is proved under general conditions. The assumptions on drift and diffusion coefficients have been relaxed to include polynomial growth and only continuity in the arguments corresponding to delays. Furthermore, the rate of convergence is obtained under one-sided and polynomial Lipschitz conditions. Finally, our findings are demonstrated with the help of numerical simulations.
