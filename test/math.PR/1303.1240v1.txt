Using It\^o's calculus and the mass optimal transportation theory, we study the generalized Dyson Brownian motion (GDBM) and the associated McKean-Vlasov evolution equation with an external potential V. Under suitable condition on V, we prove the existence and uniqueness of strong solution to SDE for GDBM. Standard argument shows that the family of the process of empirical measures L_N(t) of GDBM is tight and every accumulative point of L_N(t) in the weak convergence topology is a weak solution of the associated McKean-Vlasov evolution equation, which can be realized as the gradient flow of the Voiculescu free entropy on the Wasserstein space over \mathbb{R}. Under the condition V''\geq -K for some constant K\geq 0, we prove that the McKean-Vlasov equation has a unique solution \mu(t) and L_N(t) converges weakly to \mu(t) as N\rightarrow \infty. For C^2 convex potentials, we prove that \mu(t) converges to the equilibrium measure \mu_V with respect to the W_2-Wasserstein distance on \mathscr{P}_2(\mathbb{R}) as t\rightarrow \infty. Under the uniform convexity or a modified uniform convexity condition on V, we prove that \mu(t) converges to \mu_V with respect to the W_2-Wasserstein distance on \mathscr{P}_2(\mathbb{R}) with an exponential rate as t\rightarrow \infty. Finally, we discuss the double-well potentials and raise some conjectures.
