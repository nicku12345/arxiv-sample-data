Let \{L^z_t\} be the jointly continuous local times of a one-dimensional Brownian motion and let L^*_t=\sup_{z\in \mathbb R} L^z_t. Let V_t be any point z such that L^z_t=L^*_t, a most visited site of Brownian motion. Lifshits and Shi conjectured that if \gamma>1, then \[\liminf_{t\to \infty} \frac{|V_t|}{\sqrt t/(\log t)^\gamma}=\infty, \qquad {\rm a.s.}, \] with an analogous result for simple random walk. Version 1 purported to prove the conjecture; we point out an error in the proof.
