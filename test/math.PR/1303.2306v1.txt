As well known, for a supercritical Galton-Watson process Z_n whose offspring distribution has mean m>1, the ratio W_n:=Z_n/m^n has a.s. limit, say W. We study tail behaviour of the distributions of W_n and W in the case where Z_1 has heavy-tailed distribution, that is, \E e^{\lambda Z_1}=\infty for every \lambda>0. We show how different types of distributions of Z_1 lead to different asymptotic behaviour of the tail of W_n and W. We describe the most likely way how large values of the process occur.
