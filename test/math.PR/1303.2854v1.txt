We prove that bridges of subelliptic diffusions on a compact manifold, with distinct ends, satisfy a large deviation principle in a space of Holder continuous functions, with a good rate function, when the travel time tends to 0. This leads to the identification of the deterministic first order asymptotics of the distribution of the bridge under generic conditions on the endpoints of the bridge.
