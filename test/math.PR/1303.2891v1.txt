Let X=(X_t)_{t\ge0} be a transient diffusion process in (0,\infty) with the diffusion coefficient \sigma>0 and the scale function L such that X_t\rightarrow\infty as t\rightarrow \infty, let I_t denote its running minimum for t\ge0, and let \theta denote the time of its ultimate minimum I_{\infty}. Setting c(i,x)=1-2L(x)/L(i) we show that the stopping time \[\tau_*=\inf\{t\ge0\vert X_t\ge f_*(I_t)\}\] minimizes \mathsf{E}(\vert\theta-\tau\vert-\theta) over all stopping times \tau of X (with finite mean) where the optimal boundary f_* can be characterized as the minimal solution to \[f'(i)=-\frac{\sigma^2(f(i))L'(f(i))}{c(i,f(i))[L(f(i))-L(i)]}\int_i^{f(i)}\frac{c_i'(i,y)[L(y) -L(i)]}{\sigma^2(y)L'(y)}\,dy\] staying strictly above the curve h(i)=L^{-1}(L(i)/2) for i>0. In particular, when X is the radial part of three-dimensional Brownian motion, we find that \[\tau_ *=\inf\biggl\{t\ge0\Big\vert\frac{X_t-I_t}{I_t}\ge\varphi\biggr\},\] where \varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2=1.61\ldots is the golden ratio. The derived results are applied to problems of optimal trading in the presence of bubbles where we show that the golden ratio rule offers a rigorous optimality argument for the choice of the well-known golden retracement in technical analysis of asset prices.
