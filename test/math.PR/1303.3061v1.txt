We establish a process level large deviation principle for systems of interacting Bessel-like diffusion processes. By establishing weak uniqueness for the limiting non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, we conclude that the latter describes the process level hydrodynamic limit of such systems and obtain a propagation of chaos result. This is the first instance of results of this type in the context of interacting diffusion processes under explicit assumptions on the coefficients, where the diffusion coefficients are allowed to be both non-Lipschitz and degenerate. In the second part of the paper, we explain how systems of this type naturally arise in the study of stability of the interbank lending system and describe some financial implications of our results.
