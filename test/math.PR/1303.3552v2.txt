Let U be an open set of \mathbb{R}^n, m a positive Radon measure on U such that {\rm supp}[m]=U, and (P_t)_{t>0} a strongly continuous contraction sub-Markovian semigroup on L^2(U;m). We investigate the structure of (P_t)_{t>0}.   (i) Denote respectively by (A,D(A)) and (\hat A,D(\hat A)) the generator and the co-generator of (P_t)_{t>0}. Under the assumption that C^{\infty}_0(U)\subset D(A)\cap D(\hat A), we give an explicit L\'evy-Khintchine type representation of A on C^{\infty}_0(U).   (ii) If (P_t)_{t>0} is an analytic semigroup and hence is associated with a semi-Dirichlet form ({\cal E}, D({\cal E})), we give an explicit characterization of {\cal E} on C^{\infty}_0(U) under the assumption that C^{\infty}_0(U)\subset D({\cal E}).   We also present a LeJan type transformation rule for the diffusion part of regular semi-Dirichlet forms on general state spaces.
