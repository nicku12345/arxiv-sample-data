We introduce a stochastic individual model for the spatial behavior of an animal population of dispersive and competitive species, considering various kinds of biological effects, such as heterogeneity of environmental conditions, mutual attractive or repulsive interactions between individuals or competition between them for resources. As a consequence of the study of the large population limit, global existence of a nonnegative weak solution to a multidimensional parabolic strongly coupled model of competing species is proved. The main new feature of the corresponding integro-differential equation is the nonlocal nonlinearity appearing in the diffusion terms, which may depend on the spatial densities of all population types. Moreover, the diffusion matrix is generally not strictly positive definite and the cross-diffusion effect allows for linearly growing influences of the subpopulations' sizes. We prove uniqueness of the finite measure-valued solution and give conditions under which the solution takes values in a functional space. We then make the competition kernels converge to a Dirac measure and obtain the existence of a solution to a locally competitive version of the previous equation. The large population limit is obtained by means of weak convergence tools for measure valued processes. The techniques employed in the study of the liming equation are novel, and are essentially based on the underlying stochastic flow related to the dispersive part of the dynamics, together with the use of suitable dual distances in the space of finite measures. This is an extended version of the paper "Non local Lotka-Volterra system with cross-diffusion in a heterogeneous medium" appeared in J. Math. Biol (2015) 70:829-854.
