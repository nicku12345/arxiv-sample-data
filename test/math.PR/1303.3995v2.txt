We study the long range percolation model on \mathbb{Z} where sites i and j are connected with probability \beta |i-j|^{-s}. Graph distances are now well understood for all exponents s except in the case s=2 where the model exhibits non-trivial self-similar scaling. Establishing a conjecture of Benjamini and Berger \cite{BenBer:01}, we prove that the typical distance from site 0 to n grows as a power law n^{\theta(\beta)} up to a multiplicative constant for some exponent 0<\theta(\beta)<1 as does the diameter of the graph on a box of length n.
