The main results in this paper concern large and moderate deviations for the radial component of a n-dimensional hyperbolic Brownian motion (for n\geq 2) on the Poincar\'{e} half-space. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the hitting probability P_\eta(T_{\eta_1}^{(n)}<\infty) of a ball of radius \eta_1, as the distance \eta of the starting point of the hyperbolic Brownian motion goes to infinity.
