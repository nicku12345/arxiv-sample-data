In this paper we prove the complete characterization of a.s. convergence of orthogonal series in terms of existence of a majorizing measure. It means that for a given (a_n)^{\infty}_{n=1}, a_n>0, series \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n\varphi_n is a.e. convergent for each orthonormal sequence (\varphi_n)^{\infty}_{n=1} if and only if there exists a measure m on \[T=\{0\}\cup\Biggl\{\sum^m_{n=1}a_n^2,m\geq 1\Biggr\}\] such that \[\sup_{t\in T}\int^{\sqrt{D(T)}}_0(m(B(t,r^2)))^{-{1}/{2}}\,dr<\infty,\] where D(T)=\sup_{s,t\in T}|s-t| and B(t,r)=\{s\in T:|s-t|\leq r\}. The presented approach is based on weakly majorizing measures and a certain partitioning scheme.
