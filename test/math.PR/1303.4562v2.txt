In the Kingman coalescent tree the length of order r is defined as the sum of the lengths of all branches that support r leaves. For r=1 these branches are external, while for r\ge2 they are internal and carry a subtree with r leaves. In this paper we prove that for any s\in\mathbb{N} the vector of rescaled lengths of orders 1\le r\le s converges to the multivariate standard normal distribution as the number of leaves of the Kingman coalescent tends to infinity. To this end we use a coupling argument which shows that for any r\ge2 the (internal) length of order r behaves asymptotically in the same way as the length of order 1 (i.e., the external length).
