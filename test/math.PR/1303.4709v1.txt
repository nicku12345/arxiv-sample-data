We study distributions F on [0,\infty) such that for some T\le\infty, F^{*2}(x,x+T]\sim 2 F(x,x+T]. The case T=\infty corresponds to F being subexponential, and our analysis shows that the properties for T<\infty are, in fact, very similar to this classical case. A parallel theory is developed in the presence of densities. Applications are given to random walks, the key renewal theorem, compound Poisson process and Bellman-Harris branching processes.
