Strong convergence results on tamed Euler schemes, which approximate stochastic differential equations with superlinearly growing drift coefficients that are locally one-sided Lipschitz continuous, are presented in this article. The diffusion coefficients are assumed to be locally Lipschitz continuous and have at most linear growth. Furthermore, the classical rate of convergence, i.e. one--half, for such schemes is recovered when the local Lipschitz continuity assumptions are replaced by global and, in addition, it is assumed that the drift coefficients satisfy polynomial Lipschitz continuity.
