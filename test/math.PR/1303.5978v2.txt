This article is dedicated to the study of an SPDE of the form Lu(t,x)=\sigma(u(t,x))\dot{Z}(t,x) \quad t>0, x \in \cO with zero initial conditions and Dirichlet boundary conditions, where \sigma is a Lipschitz function, L is a second-order pseudo-differential operator, \cO is a bounded domain in \bR^d, and \dot{Z} is an \alpha-stable L\'evy noise with \alpha \in (0,2), \alpha\not=1 and possibly non-symmetric tails. To give a meaning to the concept of solution, we develop a theory of stochastic integration with respect to Z, by generalizing the method of Gin\'e and Marcus (1983) to higher dimensions and non-symmetric tails. The idea is to first solve the equation with "truncated" noise \dot{Z}_{K} (obtained by removing from Z the jumps which exceed a fixed value K), yielding a solution u_{K}, and then show that the solutions u_L,L>K coincide on the event t \leq \tau_{K}, for some stopping times \tau_K \uparrow \infty a.s. A similar idea was used in Peszat and Zabczyk (2007) in the setting of Hilbert-space valued processes. A major step is to show that the stochastic integral with respect to Z_{K} satisfies a p-th moment inequality, for p \in (\alpha,1) if \alpha<1, and p \in (\alpha,2) if \alpha>1. This inequality plays the same role as the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality in the theory of integration with respect to continuous martingales.
