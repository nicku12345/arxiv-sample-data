In this paper, we derive explicit sharp two-sided estimates for the Dirichlet heat kernels, in C^{1,1} open sets D in R^d, of a large class of subordinate Brownian motions with Gaussian components. When D is bounded, our sharp two-sided Dirichlet heat kernel estimates hold for all t>0. Integrating the heat kernel estimates with respect to the time variable t, we obtain sharp two-sided estimates for the Green functions, in bounded C^{1,1} open sets, of such subordinate Brownian motions with Gaussian components.
