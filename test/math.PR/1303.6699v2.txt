The aim of this paper is the analysis of the fractional Poisson process where the state probabilities p_k^{\nu_k}(t), t\ge 0, are governed by time-fractional equations of order 0<\nu_k\leq 1 depending on the number k of events occurred up to time t. We are able to obtain explicitely the Laplace transform of p_k^{\nu_k}(t) and various representations of state probabilities. We show that the Poisson process with intermediate waiting times depending on \nu_k differs from that constructed from the fractional state equations (in the case \nu_k = \nu, for all k, they coincide with the time-fractional Poisson process). We also introduce a different form of fractional state-dependent Poisson process as a weighted sum of homogeneous Poisson processes. Finally we consider the fractional birth process governed by equations with state-dependent fractionality.
