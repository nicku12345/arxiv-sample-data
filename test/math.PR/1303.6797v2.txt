This paper considers the limiting distribution of \pi_{\lambda,\theta}, the stationary distribution of the infinitely-many-alleles diffusion with symmetric overdominance \cite{MR1626158}. In \cite{MR2519357} the large deviation principle for \pi_{\lambda,\theta} indicates that there are countably many phase transitions for the limiting distribution of \pi_{\lambda,\theta}, and the critical points are \lambda=k(k+1), k\geq1. The asymptotic behaviours at those critical points, however, are unclear. This article provides a definite description of the critical cases.
