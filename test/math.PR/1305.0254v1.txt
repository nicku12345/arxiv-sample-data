We introduce particle systems in one or more dimensions in which particles perform branching Brownian motion and the population size is kept constant equal to N > 1, through the following selection mechanism: at all times only the N fittest particles survive, while all the other particles are removed. Fitness is measured with respect to some given score function s:\R^d \to \R. For some choices of the function s, it is proved that the cloud of particles travels at positive speed in some possibly random direction. In the case where s is linear, we show under some assumptions on the initial configuration that the shape of the cloud scales like \log N in the direction parallel to motion but at least c(\log N)^{3/2} in the orthogonal direction for some c > 0. We conjecture that the exponent 3/2 is sharp. This result is equivalent to the following result of independent interest: in one-dimensional systems, the genealogical time is greater than c(\log N)^3, thereby contributing a step towards the original predictions of Brunet and Derrida. We discuss several open problems and also explain how our results can be viewed as a rigorous justification of Weismann's arguments for the role of recombination in population genetics.
