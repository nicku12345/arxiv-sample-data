In this paper we establish spatial central limit theorems for a large class of supercritical branching Markov processes with general spatial-dependent branching mechanisms. These are generalizations of the spatial central limit theorems proved in [1], P. for branching OU processes with binary branching mechanisms. Compared with the results of [1], our central limit theorems are more satisfactory in the sense that the normal random variables in our theorems are non-degenerate.
