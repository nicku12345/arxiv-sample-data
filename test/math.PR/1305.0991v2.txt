Sufficient and necessary conditions are presented for the order-preservation of stochastic functional differential equations on \R^d with non-Lipschitzian coefficients driven by the Brownian motion and Poisson processes. The sufficiency of the conditions extends and improves some known comparison theorems derived recently for one-dimesional equations and multidimensional equations without delay, and the necessity is new even in these special situations.
