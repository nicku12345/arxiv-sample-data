We study the asymptotic tail behaviour of the first-passage time over a moving boundary for asymptotically \alpha-stable L\'evy processes with \alpha<1.   Our main result states that if the left tail of the L\'evy measure is regularly varying with index - \alpha and the moving boundary is equal to 1 - t^{\gamma} for some \gamma<1/\alpha, then the probability that the process stays below the moving boundary has the same asymptotic polynomial order as in the case of a constant boundary. The same is true for the increasing boundary 1 + t^{\gamma} with \gamma<1/\alpha under the assumption of a regularly varying right tail with index - \alpha.
