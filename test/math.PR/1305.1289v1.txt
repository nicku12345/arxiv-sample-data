In the full rectangular version of Gilbert's tessellation lines extend either horizontally (with east- and west--growing rays) or vertically (north- and south--growing rays) from seed points which form a Poisson point process, each ray stopping when another ray is met. In the half rectangular version, east and south growing rays do not interact with west and north rays. Using techniques developed in our previous paper, we derive an exact expression for the moment generating function for the ray length distribution in the half rectangular model.
