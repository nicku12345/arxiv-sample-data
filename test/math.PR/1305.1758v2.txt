For a scalar Gaussian process B on \mathbb{R}_{+} with a prescribed general variance function \gamma^{2}\left(r\right) =\mathrm{Var}\left(B\left(r\right) \right)  and a canonical metric \mathrm{E}[\left(B\left(t\right) -B\left(s\right) \right) ^{2}] which is commensurate with \gamma^{2}\left(t-s\right) , we estimate the probability for a vector of d iid copies of B to hit a bounded set A in \mathbb{R}^{d}, with conditions on \gamma which place no restrictions of power type or of approximate self-similarity, assuming only that \gamma is continuous, increasing, and concave, with \gamma\left(0\right) =0 and \gamma^{\prime}\left(0+\right) =+\infty. We identify optimal base (kernel) functions which depend explicitly on \gamma, to derive upper and lower bounds on the hitting probability in terms of the corresponding generalized Hausdorff measure and non-Newtonian capacity of A respectively. The proofs borrow and extend some recent progress for hitting probabilities estimation, including the notion of two-point local-nondeterminism in Bierm\'{e}, Lacaux, and Xiao \cite{Bierme:09}.
