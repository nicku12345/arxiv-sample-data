It is a well-known fact that finite rho-variation of the covariance (in 2D sense) of a general Gaussian process implies finite rho-variation of Cameron-Martin paths. In the special case of fractional Brownian motion (think: 2H=1/rho), in the rougher than Brownian regime, a sharper result holds thanks to a Besov-type embedding [Friz-Victoir, JFA, 2006]. In the present note we give a general result which closes this gap. We comment on the importance of this result for various applications.
