In this paper we provide existence and uniqueness results for the solution of BSDEs driven by a general square integrable martingale under partial information. We discuss some special cases where the solution to a BSDE under restricted information can be derived by that related to a problem of a BSDE under full information. In particular, we provide a suitable version of the F\"ollmer-Schweizer decomposition of a square integrable random variable working under partial information and we use this achievement to investigate the local risk-minimization approach for a semimartingale financial market model.
