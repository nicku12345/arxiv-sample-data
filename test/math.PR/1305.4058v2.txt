The continuous time random walks (CTRWs) are typically defned in the way that their trajectories are discontinuous step fuctions. This may be a unwellcome feature from the point of view of application of theese processes to model certain physical phenomena. In this article we propose alternative definition of continuous time random walks with continuous trajectories. We also give the functional limit theorem for sequence of such random walks. This result requires the use of strong Skorohod M1 topology instead of Skorohod J1 topology, which is usually used in limit theorems for ordinary CTRW processes.
