A new family of probability distributions \beta_{M, N}, M=0\cdots N, N\in\mathbb{N} on the unit interval (0, 1] is defined by the Mellin transform. The Mellin transform of \beta_{M, N} is characterized in terms of products of ratios of Barnes multiple gamma functions, shown to satisfy a functional equation, and a Shintani-type infinite product factorization. The distribution \log\beta_{M, N} is infinitely divisible. If M<N, -\log\beta_{M, N} is compound Poisson, if M=N, \log\beta_{M, N} is absolutely continuous. The integral moments of \beta_{M, N} are expressed as Selberg-type products of multiple gamma functions. The asymptotic behavior of the Mellin transform is derived and used to prove an inequality involving multiple gamma functions and establish positivity of a class of alternating power series. For application, the Selberg integral is interpreted probabilistically as a transformation of \beta_{1, 1} into a product of \beta^{-1}_{2, 2}s.
