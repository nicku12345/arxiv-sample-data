We introduce a new notion of G-expectation-weighted Sobolev spaces, or in short, G-Sobolev spaces, and prove that a backward SDEs driven by G-Brownian motion are in fact path dependent PDEs in the corresponding Sobolev spaces under G-norms. For the linear case of G corresponding the classical Wiener probability space with Wiener measure P, we have established a 1-1 correspondence between BSDE and such new type of quasilinear PDE in the corresponding P-Sobolev space. When G is nonlinear, we also provide such 1-1 correspondence between a fully nonlinear PDE in the corresponding G-Sobolev space and BSDE driven by G-Brownian. Consequently, the existence and uniqueness of such type of fully nonlinear path-dependence PDE in G-Sobolev space have been obtained via a recent results of BSDE driven by G-Brownian motion.
