For \alpha\in (0,1), we consider stochastic differential equations driven by one-sided stable processes of order \alpha: \[dX_t= \phi(X_{t-})\ dZ_t.\] We prove that pathwise uniqueness holds for this equation under the assumptions that \phi is continuous, non-decreasing and positive on \R. A counterexample is given to show that the positivity of \phi is crucial for pathwise uniqueness to hold.
