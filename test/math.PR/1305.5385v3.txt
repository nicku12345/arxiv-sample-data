Sets of orthogonal martingales are importants because they can be used as stochastic integrators in a kind of chaotic representation property, see [20]. In this paper, we revisited the problem studied by W. Schoutens in [21], investigating how an inner product derived from an Uvarov transformation of the Laguerre weight function is used in the orthogonalization procedure of a sequence of martingales related to a certain L\'evy process, called Teugels Martingales. Since the Uvarov transformation depends by a c<0, we are able to provide infinite sets of strongly orthogonal martingales, each one for every c in (-infty,0). In a similar fashion of [21], we introduce a suitable isometry between the space of polynomials and the space of linear combinations of Teugels martingales as well as the general orthogonalization procedure. Finally, the new construction is applied to the Gamma process.
