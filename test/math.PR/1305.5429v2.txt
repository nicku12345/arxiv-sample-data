Consider the Mills ratio corresponding to the standard Gaussian law, f(x)=\big(1-\Phi(x)\big)/\phi(x), \, x\ge 0, where \phi is the density function of this law and \Phi its cumulative distribution function. We prove that this function is completely monotone. In the proof we obtain a sequence of rational functions that are sharp bounds for f; it turns out that these rational functions are the convergents of the continued fraction defined by f, and provide an approximation procedure that allows to prove interesting properties where f or its derivatives are involved. As an application we show that 1/f is strictly convex.
