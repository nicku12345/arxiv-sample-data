Let S_n be the total gain in n repeated St.\ Petersburg games. It is known that n^{-1}(S_n-n\log_2n) converges in distribution to a random element Y(t) along subsequences of the form k(n)=2^{p(n)}t(n) with p(n)=\lceil\log_2k(n)\rceil\to\infty and t(n)\to t\in[\frac12,1]. We determine the Hausdorff and box-counting dimension of the range and the graph for almost all sample paths of the stochastic process \{Y(t)\}_{t\in[1/2,1]}. The results are compared to the fractal dimension of the corresponding limiting objects when gains are given by a deterministic sequence initiated by Hugo Steinhaus.
