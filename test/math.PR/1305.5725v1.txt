We investigate the convergence of McKean-Vlasov diffusions in a nonconvex landscape. These processes are linked to nonlinear partial differential equations. According to our previous results, there are at least three stationary measures under simple assumptions. Hence, the convergence problem is not classical like in the convex case. By using the method in Benedetto et al. [J. Statist. Phys. 91 (1998) 1261-1271] about the monotonicity of the free-energy, and combining this with a complete description of the set of the stationary measures, we prove the global convergence of the self-stabilizing processes.
