The understanding of site percolation on the triangular lattice progressed greatly in the last decade. Smirnov proved conformal invariance of critical percolation, thus paving the way for the construction of its scaling limit. Recently, the scaling limit of near-critical percolation was also constructed by Garban, Pete and Schramm. The aim of this very modest contribution is to explain how these results imply the convergence, as p tends to p_c, of the Wulff crystal to a Euclidean disk. The main ingredient of the proof is the rotational invariance of the scaling limit of near-critical percolation proved by these three mathematicians.
