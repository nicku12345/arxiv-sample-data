We establish the global asymptotic equivalence between a pure jumps L\'evy process \{X_t\} on the time interval [0,T] with unknown L\'evy measure \nu belonging to a non-parametric class and the observation of 2m^2 Poisson independent random variables with parameters linked with the L\'evy measure \nu. The equivalence result is asymptotic as m tends to infinity. The time T is kept fixed and the sample path is continuously observed. This result justifies the idea that, from a statistical point of view, knowing how many jumps fall into a grid of intervals gives asymptotically the same amount of information as observing \{X_t\}.
