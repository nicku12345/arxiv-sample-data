We consider random walks, say W_n=(M_0, M_1,\dots, M_n), of length n starting at 0 and based on the martingale sequence M_k with differences X_m=M_m-M_{m-1}. Assuming that the differences are bounded, |X_m|\leq 1, we solve the problem \begin{equation} D_n(x)\=\sup P \left\{W_n \ \text{visits an interval}\ [x,\infty)\right\},\qquad x\in R, \label{piirma} \end{equation} where \sup is taken over all possible W_n. In particular, we describe random walks which maximize the probability in \eqref{piirma}. We also extend the result to super-martingales.
