Let N and M be positive integers satisfying 1\le M\le N, and let 0<p_0<p_1<1. Define a process \{X_n\}_{n=0}^\infty on \mathbb{Z} as follows. At each step, the process jumps either one step to the right or one step to the left, according to the following mechanism. For the first N steps, the process behaves like a random walk that jumps to the right with probability p_0 and to the left with probability 1-p_0. At subsequent steps the jump mechanism is defined as follows: if at least M out of the N most recent jumps were to the right, then the probability of jumping to the right is p_1; however, if fewer than M out of the N most recent jumps were to the right, then the probability of jumping to the right is p_0. We calculate the speed of the process. Then we let N\to\infty and \frac MN\to r\in[0,1], and calculate the limiting speed. More generally, we consider the above questions for a random walk with a finite number l of threshold levels, (M_i,p_i)_{i=1}^l, above the pre-threshold level p_0, as well as for one model with l=N such thresholds.
