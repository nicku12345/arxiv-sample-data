In this work we connect the theory of Dirichlet forms and direct stochastic calculus to obtain strong existence and pathwise uniqueness for Brownian motion that is perturbed by a series of constant multiples of local times at a sequence of points that has exactly one accumulation point in \mathbb{R}. The considered process is identified as special distorted Brownian motion X in dimension one and is studied thoroughly. Besides strong uniqueness, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for non-explosion, recurrence and positive recurrence as well as for X to be semimartingale and possible applications to advection-diffusion in layered media.
