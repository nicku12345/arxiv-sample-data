This paper demonstrates the occurrence of the feature called BRAVO (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Output) for the departure process of a finite-buffer Markovian many-server system in the QED (Quality and Efficiency-Driven) heavy-traffic regime. The results are based on evaluating the limit of a formula for the asymptotic variance of death counts in finite birth--death processes.
