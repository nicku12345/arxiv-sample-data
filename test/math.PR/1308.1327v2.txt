In this paper we will take under consideration subordinators and their inverse processes (hitting-times). We will present in general the governing equations of such processes by means of convolution-type integro-differential operators similar to the fractional derivatives. Furthermore we will discuss the concept of time-changed C_0-semigroup in case the time-change is performed by means of the hitting-time of a subordinator. We will show that such time-change give rise to bounded linear operators not preserving the semigroup property and we will present their governing equations by using again integro-differential operators. Such operators are non-local and therefore we will investigate the presence of long-range dependence.
