We deal with a random graph model evolving in discrete time steps by duplicating and deleting the edges of randomly chosen vertices. We prove the existence of an a.s. asymptotic degree distribution, with streched exponential decay; more precisely, the proportion of vertices of degree d tends to some positive number c_d>0 almost surely as the number of steps goes to infinity, and c_d\sim (e\pi)^{1/2} d^{1/4} e^{-2\sqrt d} holds as d\to\infty.
