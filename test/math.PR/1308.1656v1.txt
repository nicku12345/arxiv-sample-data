We study the total mass of a d-dimensional super-Brownian motion as it first exits an increasing sequence of balls. The process of the total mass is a time-inhomogeneous continuous-state branching process, where the increasing radii of the balls are taken as the time parameter. We are able to characterise its time-dependent branching mechanism and show that it converges, as time goes to infinity, towards the branching mechanism of the total mass of a one-dimensional super-Brownian motion as it first crosses above an increasing sequence of levels. Our results allow us to identify the compact support criterion given in Sheu (1994) as a classical Grey condition (1974) for the aforementioned limiting branching mechanism.
