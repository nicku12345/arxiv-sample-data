Let \mu and \nu be two probability measures on \R^d, where \mu(\d x)= \e^{-V(x)}\d x for some V\in C^1(\R^d). Explicit sufficient conditions on V and \nu are presented such that \mu*\nu satisfies the log-Sobolev, Poincar\'e and super Poincar\'e inequalities. In particular, the recent results on the log-Sobolev inequality derived in \cite{Z} for convolutions of the Gaussian measure and compactly supported probability measures are improved and extended.
