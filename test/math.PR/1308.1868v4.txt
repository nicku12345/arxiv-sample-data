We construct and describe the extremal process for variable speed branching Brownian motion, studied recently by Fang and Zeitouni, for the case of piecewise constant speeds; in fact for simplicity we concentrate on the case when the speed is \sigma_1 for s\leq bt and \sigma_2 when bt\leq s\leq t. In the case \sigma_1>\sigma_2, the process is the concatenation of two BBM extremal processes, as expected. In the case \sigma_1<\sigma_2, a new family of cluster point processes arises, that are similar, but distinctively different from the BBM process. Our proofs follow the strategy of Arguin, Bovier, and Kistler.
