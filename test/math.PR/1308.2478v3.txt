We will investigate the value and inactive region of optimal stopping and one-sided singular control problems by focusing on two fundamental ratios. We shall see that these ratios unambiguously characterize the solution, although usually only near boundaries. We will also study the well-known connection between these problems and find it to be a local property rather than a global one. The results are illustrated by a number of examples.
