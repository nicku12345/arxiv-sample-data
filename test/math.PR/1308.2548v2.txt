We study the simple random walk on the giant component of a supercritical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph on n vertices, in particular the so-called vacant set at level u, the complement of the trajectory of the random walk run up to a time proportional to u and n. We show that the component structure of the vacant set exhibits a phase transition at a critical parameter u_{\star}: For u<u_{\star} the vacant set has with high probability a unique giant component of order n and all other components small, of order at most \log^{7}n, whereas for u>u_{\star} it has with high probability all components small. Moreover, we show that u_{\star} coincides with the critical parameter of random interlacements on a Poisson-Galton-Watson tree, which was identified in [Tas10].
