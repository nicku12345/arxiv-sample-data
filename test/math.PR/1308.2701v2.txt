Several stochastic processes related to transient L\'evy processes with potential densities u(x,y)=u(y-x), that need not be symmetric nor bounded on the diagonal, are defined and studied.   They are real valued processes on a space of measures V endowed with a metric d. Sufficient conditions are obtained for the continuity of these processes on (V,d). The processes include n-fold self-intersection local times of transient L\'evy processes and permanental chaoses, which are `loop soup n-fold self-intersection local times' constructed from the loop soup of the L\'evy process. Loop soups are also used to define permanental Wick powers, which generalizes standard Wick powers, a class of n-th order Gaussian chaoses. Dynkin type isomorphism theorems are obtained that relate the various processes.   Poisson chaos processes are defined and permanental Wick powers are shown to have a Poisson chaos decomposition. Additional properties of Poisson chaos processes are studied and a martingale extension is obtained for many of the processes described above.
