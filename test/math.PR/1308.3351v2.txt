Consider a stationary renewal point process on the real line and divide each of the segments it defines in a proportion given by \iid realisations of a fixed distribution G supported by [0,1]. We ask ourselves for which interpoint distribution F and which division distributions G, the division points is again a renewal process with the same F? An evident case is that of degenerate F and G. Interestingly, the only other possibility is when F is Gamma and G is Beta with related parameters. In particular, the division points of a Poisson process is again Poisson, if the division distribution is Beta: B(r,1-r) for some 0<r<1. We show a similar behaviour of random exchange models when a countable number of `agents' exchange randomly distributed parts of their `masses' with neighbours. More generally, a Dirichlet distribution arises in these models as a fixed point distribution preserving independence of the masses at each step. We also show that for each G there is a unique attractor, a distribution of the infinite sequence of masses, which is a fixed point of the random exchange and to which iterations of a non-equilibrium configuration of masses converge weakly. In particular, iteratively applying B(r,1-r)-divisions to a realisation of any renewal process with finite second moment of F yields a Poisson process of the same intensity in the limit.
