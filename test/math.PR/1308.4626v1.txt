In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for transience for a class of one-dimensional symmetric L\'evy processes. More precisely, we prove that a one-dimensional symmetric L\'evy process with the L\'evy measure \nu(dy)=f(y)dy or \nu(\{n\})=p_n, where the density function f(y) is such that f(y)>0 a.e. and the sequence \{p_n\}_{n\geq1} is such that p_n>0 for all n\geq1, is transient if \int_1^{\infty}\frac{dy}{y^{3}f(y)}<\infty\quad\textrm{or}\quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{3}p_n}<\infty. Similarly, we derive an analogous transience condition for one-dimensional symmetric random walks with continuous and discrete jumps.
