Consider a 1-dimensional centered Gaussian process W with \alpha-H\"older continuous paths on the compact intervals of \mathbb R_+ (\alpha\in ]0,1[) and W_0 = 0, and X the local solution in rough paths sense of Jacobi's equation driven by the signal W. The global existence and the uniqueness of the solution are proved via a change of variable taking into account the singularities of the vector field, because it doesn't satisfy the non-explosion condition. The regularity of the associated It\^o map is studied. By using these deterministic results, Jacobi's equation is studied on probabilistic side : an ergodic theorem in L. Arnold's random dynamical systems framework, and the existence of an explicit density with respect to Lebesgue's measure for each X_t, t > 0 are proved. The paper concludes on a generalization of Morris-Lecar's neuron model, where the normalized conductance of the \textrm{K}^+ current is the solution of a generalized Jacobi's equation.
