T. Szarek [Stud. Math. 189 (2008), {\S} 4] have discussed the relationship between two important notions concerning Markov semigroups: the asymptotic strong Feller property and the e-property, asserting that the former property implies the latter one. In this very short note we rectify this issue exhibiting a simple example of a Markov-Feller semigroup enjoying the asymptotic strong Feller property, for which the e-property is not satisfied. (See also the comment on a connection between the asymptotic strong Feller property and the e-property by T. Szarek, D. Worm [ETDS 32 (2012), {\S} 1]). Additionally we give a very simple example - in comparing with the one given by T. Szarek [Stud. Math. 189 (2008), {\S} 4] - showing that also the converse implication does not hold.
