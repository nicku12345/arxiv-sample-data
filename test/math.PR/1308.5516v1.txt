In this paper we consider the (weighted) spectral measure \mu_n of a n\times n random matrix, distributed according to a classical Gaussian, Laguerre or Jacobi ensemble, and show a moderate deviation principle for the standardised signed measure \sqrt{n/a_n}(\mu_n -\sigma). The centering measure \sigma is the weak limit of the empirical eigenvalue distribution and the rate function is given in terms of the L^2-norm of the density with respect to \sigma. The proof involves the tridiagonal representations of the ensembles which provide us with a sequence of independent random variables and a link to orthogonal polynomials.
