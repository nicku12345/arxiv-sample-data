This paper leads with a random polymer model in \Z^2 having long-range self-repulsive interactions. By comparison with a long range one-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model we shown that the polymer models we considered here undergo a phase transition in terms of the inverse temperature \beta. In the second part of this work we shown, using the Lee-Yang Circle Theorem, that our random polymer model with drifts satisfies the, Wu Liming [7], C^2 regularity condition. As consequence we obtain a Central Limit Theorem for the model.
