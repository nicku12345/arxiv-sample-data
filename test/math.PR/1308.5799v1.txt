By using the Malliavin calculus and finite-jump approximations, the Driver-type integration by parts formula is established for the semigroup associated to stochastic differential equations with noises containing a subordinate Brownian motion. As applications, the shift-Harnack inequality and heat kernel estimates are derived. The main results are illustrated by SDEs driven by \aa-stable like processes.
