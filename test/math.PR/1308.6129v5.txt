The dimension free Harnack inequality for the heat semigroup is established on the \RCD(K,\infty) space, which is a non-smooth metric measure space having the Ricci curvature bounded from below in the sense of Lott-Sturm-Villani plus the Cheeger energy being quadratic. As its applications, the heat semigroup entropy-cost inequality and contractivity properties of the semigroup are studied, and a strong enough Gaussian concentration implying the log-Sobolev inequality is also shown as a generalization of the one on the smooth Riemannian manifold.
