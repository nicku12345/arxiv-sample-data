Let \chi_n(t) = (\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2(t))^{1/2},t\ge0 be a chi-process with n degrees of freedom where X_i's are independent copies of some generic centered Gaussian process X. This paper derives the exact asymptotic behavior of P{\sup_{t\in[0,T]} \chi_n(t)>u} as u \to \infty, where T is a given positive constant, and g(\cdot) is some non-negative bounded measurable function. The case g(t)\equiv0 is investigated in numerous contributions by V.I. Piterbarg. Our novel asymptotic results for both stationary and non-stationary Xare referred to as Piterbarg theorems for chi-processes with trend.
