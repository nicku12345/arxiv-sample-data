This contribution derives the exact asymptotic behaviour of the supremum of alpha(t)-locally stationary Gaussian random fields over a finite hypercube. We present two applications of our result; the first one deals with extremes of ggregate multifractional Brownian motions, whereas the second application establishes the exact asymptotics of the supremum of chi-processes generated by multifractional Brownian motions.
