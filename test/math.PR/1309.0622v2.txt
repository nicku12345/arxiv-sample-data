We provide explicit expressions for the constants involved in the characterisation of ergodicity of sub-geometric Markov chains. The constants are determined in terms of those appearing in the assumed drift and one-step minorisation conditions. The result is fundamental for the study of some algorithms where uniform bounds for these constants are needed for a family of Markov kernels. Our result accommodates also some classes of inhomogeneous chains.
