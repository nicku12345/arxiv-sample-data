We consider an anisotropic bond percolation model on \mathbb{Z}^2, with \textbf{p}=(p_h,p_v)\in [0,1]^2, p_v>p_h, and declare each horizontal (respectively vertical) edge of \mathbb{Z}^2 to be open with probability p_h(respectively p_v), and otherwise closed, independently of all other edges. Let x=(x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 with 0<x_1<x_2, and x'=(x_2,x_1)\in \mathbb{Z}^2. It is natural to ask how the two point connectivity function \prob(\{0\leftrightarrow x\}) behaves, and whether anisotropy in percolation probabilities implies the strict inequality \prob(\{0\leftrightarrow x\})>\prob(\{0\leftrightarrow x'\}). In this note we give an affirmative answer in the highly supercritical regime.
