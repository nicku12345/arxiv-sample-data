Recently, Kothari et al.\ gave an algorithm for testing the surface area of an arbitrary set A \subset [0, 1]^n. Specifically, they gave a randomized algorithm such that if A's surface area is less than S then the algorithm will accept with high probability, and if the algorithm accepts with high probability then there is some perturbation of A with surface area at most \kappa_n S. Here, \kappa_n is a dimension-dependent constant which is strictly larger than 1 if n \ge 2, and grows to 4/\pi as n \to \infty.   We give an improved analysis of Kothari et al.'s algorithm. In doing so, we replace the constant \kappa_n with 1 + \eta for \eta > 0 arbitrary. We also extend the algorithm to more general measures on Riemannian manifolds.
