In this paper, we work on a class of self-interacting nearest neighbor random walks, introduced in [Probab. Theory Related Fields 154 (2012) 149-163], for which there is competition between repulsion of neighboring edges and attraction of next-to-neighboring edges. Erschler, T\'{o}th and Werner proved in [Probab. Theory Related Fields 154 (2012) 149-163] that, for any L\ge1, if the parameter \alpha belongs to a certain interval (\alpha_{L+1},\alpha_L), then such random walks localize on L+2 sites with positive probability. They also conjectured that this is the almost sure behavior. We prove this conjecture partially, stating that the walk localizes on L+2 or L+3 sites almost surely, under the same assumptions. We also prove that, if \alpha\in(1,+\infty)=(\alpha_2,\alpha_1), then the walk localizes a.s. on 3 sites.
