We prove that if f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} is Lipschitz continuous, then for every H\in(0,1/4] there exists a probability space on which we can construct a fractional Brownian motion X with Hurst parameter H, together with a process Y that: (i) is H\"older-continuous with H\"older exponent \gamma for any \gamma\in(0,H); and (ii) solves the differential equation dY_t = f(Y_t) dX_t. More significantly, we describe the law of the stochastic process Y in terms of the solution to a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation.
