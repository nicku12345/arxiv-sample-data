Consider a N\times n matrix \Sigma_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}R_n^{1/2}X_n, where R_n is a nonnegative definite Hermitian matrix and X_n is a random matrix with i.i.d. real or complex standardized entries. The fluctuations of the linear statistics of the eigenvalues \[\operatorname {Trace}f \bigl(\Sigma_n\Sigma_n^*\bigr)=\sum_{i=1}^Nf(\lambda_i),\qquad (\lambda_i)\ eigenvalues\ of\ \Sigma_n\Sigma_n^*,\] are shown to be Gaussian, in the regime where both dimensions of matrix \Sigma_n go to infinity at the same pace and in the case where f is of class C^3, that is, has three continuous derivatives. The main improvements with respect to Bai and Silverstein's CLT [Ann. Probab. 32 (2004) 553-605] are twofold: First, we consider general entries with finite fourth moment, but whose fourth cumulant is nonnull, that is, whose fourth moment may differ from the moment of a (real or complex) Gaussian random variable. As a consequence, extra terms proportional to  \vert \mathcal{V}\vert ^2=\bigl|\mathbb{E}\bigl(X_{11}^n\bigr) ^2\bigr|^2 and \kappa=\mathbb{E}\bigl \vert X_{11}^n\bigr \vert ^4-\vert {\mathcal{V}}\vert ^2-2 appear in the limiting variance and in the limiting bias, which not only depend on the spectrum of matrix R_n but also on its eigenvectors. Second, we relax the analyticity assumption over f by representing the linear statistics with the help of Helffer-Sj\"{o}strand's formula. The CLT is expressed in terms of vanishing L\'{e}vy-Prohorov distance between the linear statistics' distribution and a Gaussian probability distribution, the mean and the variance of which depend upon N and n and may not converge.
