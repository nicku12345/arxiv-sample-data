In this paper we extend the definition of time conditional G-expectations \mathbb{\hat{E}}_{t}[\cdot] to a larger domain on which the dynamical consistency still holds. In fact we can consistently define, by taking the limit, the time conditional expectations for each random variable X which is the downward limit (resp. upward limit) of a monotone sequence \{X_{i}\} in L_{G}^{1}(\Omega). To accomplish this procedure, some careful analysis is needed. Moreover, we give a suitable definition of stopping times and obtain the optional stopping theorem. We also provide some basic and interesting properties for the extended conditional G-expectations.
