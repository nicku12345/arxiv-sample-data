The production of molecules in a chemical reaction network is modelled as a Poisson process with a Markov-modulated arrival rate and an exponential decay rate. We analyze the distributional properties of M, the number of molecules, under specific time-scaling; the background process is sped up by N^{\alpha}, the arrival rates are scaled by N, for N large. A functional central limit theorem is derived for M, which after centering and scaling, converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. A dichotomy depending on \alpha is observed. For \alpha\leq1 the parameters of the limiting process contain the deviation matrix associated with the background process.
