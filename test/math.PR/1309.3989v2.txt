We consider a stationary Poisson hyperplane process with given directional distribution and intensity in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Generalizing the zero cell of such a process, we fix a convex body K and consider the intersection of all closed halfspaces bounded by hyperplanes of the process and containing K. We study how well these random polytopes approximate K (measured by the Hausdorff distance) if the intensity increases, and how this approximation depends on the directional distribution in relation to properties of K.
