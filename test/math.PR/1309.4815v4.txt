The circular law asserts that if X_n is a n \times n matrix with iid complex entries of mean zero and unit variance, then the empirical spectral distribution of \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} X_n converges almost surely to the uniform distribution on the unit disk as n tends to infinity. Answering a question of Tao, we prove the circular law for a general class of random block matrices with dependent entries. The proof relies on an inverse-type result for the concentration of linear operators and multilinear forms.
