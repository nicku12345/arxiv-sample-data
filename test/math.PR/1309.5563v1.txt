Fix an integer n>2 and let (X(t))_{t\ge 0} be the pseudo-process driven by the high-order heat-type equation \partial/\partial t=\pm\partial^N/\partial x^N. The denomination "pseudo-process" means that (X(t))_{t\ge 0} is related to a signed measure (which is not a probability measure) with total mass equal to 1. In this note, we present some results and discuss some problems concerning the pseudo-distributions of the first overshooting times of a single barrier \{a\} or a double barrier \{a,b\} by (X(t))_{t\ge 0}, as well as those of the sojourn times of (X(t))_{t\ge 0} in the intervals [a,+\infty) and [a,b] up to a fixed time.
