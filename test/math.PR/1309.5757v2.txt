We consider a model of long-range first-passage percolation on the d dimensional square lattice Z^d in which any two distinct vertices x, y \in Z^d are connected by an edge having exponentially distributed passage time with mean ||x-y||^{\alpha+o(1)}, where \alpha>0 is a fixed parameter and ||\cdot|| is the \ell_1-norm on Z^d. We analyze the asymptotic growth rate of the set B_t, which consists of all x \in Z^d such that the first-passage time between the origin 0 and x is at most t, as t\to\infty. We show that depending on the values of \alpha there are four growth regimes:   (i) instantaneous growth for \alpha<d,   (ii) stretched exponential growth for \alpha\in (d,2d),   (iii) superlinear growth for \alpha\in (2d,2d+1) and finally   (iv) linear growth for \alpha>2d+1 like the nearest-neighbor first-passage percolation model corresponding to \alpha=\infty.
