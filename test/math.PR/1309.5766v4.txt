We present two examples of loss of the predictable representation property for semi-martingales by enlargement of the reference filtration. First of all we show that the predictable representation property for a square-integrable semi-martingale X does not transfer from the reference filtration F to a larger filtration G when the information starts growing up to a positive time. Then we study the case when F coincides with the natural filtration of X and G is obtained by adding the natural filtration of a second square-integrable semi-martingale, Y. We establish conditions under which the triplet (X,Y,[X,Y]) enjoys the predictable representation property with respect to G.
