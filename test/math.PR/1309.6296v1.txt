Let G be a finitely generated group equipped with a symmetric generating % k -tuple S. Let |\cdot| and V be the associated word length and volume growth function. Let \nu be a probability measure such that % \nu(g)\simeq [(1+|g|)^2V(|g|)]^{-1}. We prove that if G has polynomial volume growth then \nu^{(n)}(e) \simeq V(\sqrt{n\log n})^{-1}. We also obtain assorted estimates for other spread-out probability measures.
