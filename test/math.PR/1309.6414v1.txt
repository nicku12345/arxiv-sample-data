Suppose that d\geq1 and \alpha\in (1, 2). Let Y be a rotationally symmetric \alpha-stable process on \R^d and b a \R^d-valued measurable function on \R^d belonging to a certain Kato class of Y. We show that \rd X^b_t=\rd Y_t+b(X^b_t)\rd t with X^b_0=x has a unique weak solution for every x\in \R^d. Let \sL^b=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} + b \cdot \nabla, which is the infinitesimal generator of X^b. Denote by C^\infty_c(\R^d) the space of smooth functions on \R^d with compact support. We further show that the martingale problem for (\sL^b, C^\infty_c(\R^d)) has a unique solution for each initial value x\in \R^d.
