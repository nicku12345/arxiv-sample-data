We consider two independent symmetric Markov random flights \bold Z_1(t) and \bold Z_2(t) performed by the particles that simultaneously start from the origin of the Euclidean plane \Bbb R^2 in random directions distributed uniformly on the unit circumference S_1 and move with constant finite velocities c_1>0, \; c_2>0, respectively. The new random directions are taking uniformly on S_1 at random time instants that form independent homogeneous Poisson flows of rates \lambda_1>0, \; \lambda_2>0.   The probability distribution function of the Euclidean distance \rho(t)=\Vert \bold Z_1(t) - \bold Z_2(t) \Vert, \qquad t>0, between \bold Z_1(t) and \bold Z_2(t) at arbitrary time instant t>0, is obtained.
