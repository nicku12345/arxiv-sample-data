Let X be a second countable locally compact Abelian group containing no subgroup topologically isomorphic to the circle group \mathbb{T}. Let \mu be a probability distribution on X such that its characteristic function \hat\mu(y) does not vanish and \hat\mu(y) for some n \geq 3 satisfies the equation  \prod_{j=1}^{n} \hat\mu(y_j + y) = \prod_{j=1}^{n}\hat\mu(y_j - y), \quad \sum_{j=1}^{n} y_j = 0, \quad y_1,\dots,y_n,y \in Y.  Then \mu is a convolution of a Gaussian distribution and a distribution supported in the subgroup of X generated by elements of order 2.
