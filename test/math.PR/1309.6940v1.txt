Skorokhod's representation theorem states that if on a Polish space, there is defined a weakly convergent sequence of probability measures \mu_n\stackrel{w}\to\mu_0, as n\to \infty, then there exist a probability space (\Omega, \mathscr F, P) and a sequence of random elements X_n such that X_n\to X almost surely and X_n has the distribution function \mu_n, n=0,1,2,\cdots. In this paper, we shall extend the Skorokhod representation theorem to the case where if there are a sequence of separable metric spaces S_n, a sequence of probability measures \mu_n and a sequence of measurable mappings \varphi_n such that \mu_n\varphi_n^{-1}\stackrel {w}\to\mu_0, then there exist a probability space (\Omega,\mathscr F,P) and S_n-valued random elements X_n defined on \Omega, with distribution \mu_n and such that \varphi_n(X_n)\to X_0 almost surely. In addition, we present several applications of our result including some results in random matrix theory, while the original Skorokhod representation theorem is not applicable.
