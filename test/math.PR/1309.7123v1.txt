In this paper, we are interested in solving general time interval multidimensional backward stochastic differential equations in L^p (p\geq 1). We first study the existence and uniqueness for L^p (p>1) solutions by the method of convolution and weak convergence when the generator is monotonic in y and Lipschitz continuous in z both non-uniformly with respect to t. Then we obtain the existence and uniqueness for L^1 solutions with an additional assumption that the generator has a sublinear growth in z non-uniformly with respect to t.
