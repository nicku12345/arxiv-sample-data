In this paper, we consider a classic problem concerning the high excursion probabilities of a Gaussian random field f living on a compact set T. We develop efficient computational methods for the tail probabilities P(\sup_T f(t) > b) and the conditional expectations E(\Gamma(f) | \sup_T f(t) > b) as b\rightarrow \infty. For each \varepsilon positive, we present Monte Carlo algorithms that run in \emph{constant} time and compute the interesting quantities with \varepsilon relative error for arbitrarily large b. The efficiency results are applicable to a large class of H\"older continuous Gaussian random fields. Besides computations, the proposed change of measure and its analysis techniques have several theoretical and practical indications in the asymptotic analysis of extremes of Gaussian random fields.
