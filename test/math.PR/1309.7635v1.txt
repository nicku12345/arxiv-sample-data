We consider the so-called \natural-model. It is an one-default model which gives the conditional law of a random time with respect to a reference filtration. This model has been studied in the case where the parameters are continuous. In this paper we will establish the \natural-model in the case of jump parameters. We then prove the corresponding enlargement of filtration formula and we compute the derivative of the conditional distribution functions of the random time.
