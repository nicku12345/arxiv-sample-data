In this paper we study the conditional limit theorems for critical continuous-state branching processes with branching mechanism \psi(\lambda)=\lambda^{1+\alpha}L(1/\lambda) where \alpha\in [0,1] and L is slowly varying at \infty. We prove that if \alpha\in (0,1], there are norming constants Q_{t}\to 0 (as t\uparrow +\infty) such that for every x>0, P_{x}\left(Q_{t}X_{t}\in\cdot|X_{t}>0\right) converges weakly to a non-degenerate limit. The converse assertion is also true provided the regularity of \psi at 0. We give a conditional limit theorem for the case \alpha=0. The limit theorems we obtain in this paper allow infinite variance of the branching process.
