We look at joint regular variation properties of MA(\infty) processes of the form \mathbf{X} = (X_k, k \in \mathbb{Z}) where X_k = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \psi_j Z_{k-j} and the sequence of random variables (Z_i, i \in \mathbb{Z}) are i.i.d. with regularly varying tails. We use the setup of \mathbb{M}_{\mathbb{O}}-convergence and obtain hidden regular variation properties for \mathbf{X} under suitable summability conditions on the constant coefficients (\psi_j : j \geq 0). Our approach emphasizes continuity properties of mappings and produces regular variation in sequence space.
