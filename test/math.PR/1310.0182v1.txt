We give a short summary of Varopoulos' generalised Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for self-adjoint C_{0} semigroups and give a new probabilistic representation of the classical fractional integral operators on \R^n as projections of martingale transforms. Using this formula we derive a new proof of the classical Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality based on Burkholder-Gundy and Doob's inequalities for martingales.
