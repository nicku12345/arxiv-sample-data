We investigate a way of comparing and classifying tails of random variables. Our approach extends the notion of classical indices, such as exponential and moment indices, which are widely used measuring heaviness of tail functions. A non-parametric risk measure applicable for all heavy-tailed random variables is obtained as a concave function that represents the decay speed of tail function. Many key properties of the distribution of a random variable are encoded into this function, which enables a new way to estimate tails. The latter half of the paper is devoted to numerous examples illustrating properties of the results developed during the first half.
