We call `bits' a sequence of devices indexed by positive integers, where every device can be in two states: 0 (idle) and 1 (active). Start from the `ground state' of the system when all bits are in 0-state. In our first Binary Flipping (BF) model, the evolution of the system is the following: at each time step choose one bit from a given distribution \mathcal{P} on the integers independently of anything else, then flip the state of this bit to the opposite. In our second Damaged Bits (DB) model a `damaged' state is added: each selected idling bit changes to active, but selecting an active bit changes its state to damaged in which it then stays forever.   In both models we analyse the recurrence of the system's ground state when no bits are active. We present sufficient conditions for both BF and DB models to show recurrent or transient behaviour, depending on the properties of \mathcal{P}. We provide a bound for fractional moments of the return time to the ground state for the BF model, and prove a Central Limit Theorem for the number of active bits for both models.
