This paper deals with the quantitative normal approximation of non-linear functionals of Poisson random measures, where the quality is measured by the Kolmogorov distance. Combining Stein's method with the Malliavin calculus of variations on the Poisson space, we derive a bound, which is strictly smaller than what is available in the literature. This is applied to sequences of multiple integrals and sequences of Poisson functionals having a finite chaotic expansion. This leads to new Berry-Esseen bounds in de Jong's theorem for degenerate U-statistics. Moreover, geometric functionals of intersection processes of Poisson k-flats, random graph statistics of the Boolean model and non-linear functionals of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-L\'evy processes are considered.
