Let G(N,p)=(V,E) be an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph and (X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} be a simple random walk on it. We study the the order of magnitude of \sum_{i \in V} \pi_ih_{ij}  where \pi_i=d_i / 2|E| for d_i the number of neighbors of node i and h_{ij} the hitting time for (X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} between nodes i and j, in a regime of p=p(N) such that G(N,p) is almost surely connected as N\to\infty. Our main result is that \sum_{i \in V} \pi_ih_{ij}  is almost surely of order N(1+o(1)) as N\to \infty, which coincides with previous results in the physics literature \cite{sood}, though our techniques are based on large deviations bounds on the number of neighbors of a typical node and the number of edges in G(N,p) together with recent work on bounds on the spectrum of the (random) adjacency matrix of G(N,p).
