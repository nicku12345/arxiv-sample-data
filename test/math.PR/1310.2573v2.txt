We first prove that, for \kappa\in(0,4), a whole-plane SLE(\kappa;\kappa+2) trace stopped at a fixed capacity time satisfies reversibility. We then use this reversibility result to prove that, for \kappa\in(0,4), a chordal SLE_\kappa curve stopped at a fixed capacity time can be mapped conformally to the initial segment of a whole-plane SLE(\kappa;\kappa+2) trace. A similar but weaker result holds for radial SLE_\kappa. These results are then used to study the ergodic behavior of an SLE curve near its tip point at a fixed capacity time. The proofs rely on the symmetry of backward SLE laminations and conformal removability of SLE_\kappa curves for \kappa\in(0,4).
