We introduce a generalized Dynkin game problem with non linear conditional expectation {\cal E} induced by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) with jumps. Let \xi, \zeta be two RCLL adapted processes with \xi \leq \zeta. The criterium is given by \begin{equation*}   {\cal J}_{\tau, \sigma}= {\cal E}_{0, \tau \wedge \sigma } \left(\xi_{\tau}\textbf{1}_{\{ \tau \leq \sigma\}}+\zeta_{\sigma}\textbf{1}_{\{\sigma<\tau\}}\right)   \end{equation*} where \tau and  \sigma are stopping times valued in [0,T]. Under Mokobodski's condition, we establish the existence of a value function for this game, i.e. \inf_{\sigma}\sup_{\tau} {\cal J}_{\tau, \sigma} = \sup_{\tau} \inf_{\sigma} {\cal J}_{\tau, \sigma}. This value can be characterized via a doubly reflected BSDE. Using this characterization, we provide some new results on these equations, such as comparison theorems and a priori estimates. When \xi and \zeta are left upper semicontinuous along stopping times, we prove the existence of a saddle point. We also study a generalized mixed game problem when the players have two actions: continuous control and stopping. We then address the generalized Dynkin game in a Markovian framework and its links with parabolic partial integro-differential variational inequalities with two obstacles.
