A \tau function formalism for Sakai's elliptic Painlev'e equation is presented. This establishes the equivalence between the two formulations by Sakai and by Ohta-Ramani-Grammaticos. We also give a simple geometric description of the elliptic Painlev'e equation as a non-autonomous deformation of the addition formula on elliptic curves. By using these formulations, we construct a particular solution of the elliptic Painlev'e equation expressed in terms of the elliptic hypergeometric function_10E_9.
