Let A be the central extension of the preprojective algebra of an ADE quiver introduced by P. Etingof and E. Rains in math/0503393. The paper math/0606403 computes the structure of the zeroth Hochschild (co)homology of A. We generalize the results of math/0606403 by calculating the additive structure of all the Hochschild homology and cohomology groups of A and the cyclic homology of A, and to describe the universal deformation of A. Namely, we show that the (co)homology is periodic with period 4, and compute the first four (co)homology groups in each case.
