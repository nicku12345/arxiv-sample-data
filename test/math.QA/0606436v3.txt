In this paper, we compute the Gerstenhaber bracket on the Hoch-schild cohomology of C^\infty(M)\rtimes G for a finite group G acting on a compact manifold M. Using this computation, we obtain geometric descriptions for all noncommutative Poisson structures on C^\infty(M)\rtimes G when M is a symplectic manifold. We also discuss examples of deformation quantizations of these noncommutative Poisson structures.
