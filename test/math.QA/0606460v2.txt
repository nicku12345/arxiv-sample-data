We prove that the v-decomposition number d_{\lambda\mu}(v) is an even or odd polynomial according to whether the partitions \lambda and \mu have the same relative sign (or parity) or not. We then use this result to verify Martin's conjecture for weight 3 blocks of symmetric group algebras -- that these blocks have the property that their projective (indecomposable) modules have a common radical length 7.
