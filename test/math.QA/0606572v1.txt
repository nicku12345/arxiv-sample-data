In a biFrobenius algebra H, in particular in the case that H is a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, the antipode S can be decomposed as S= cf where c and f are the Frobenius and coFrobenius isomorphisms. We use this decomposition to present an easy proof of Radford's formula for the fourth composition power of S. Then, in the case that the map S is the convolution inverse of the identity, we prove the trace formula for the trace of the square of S. We finish by applying the above results to study the semisimplicity and cosemisimplicity of H.
