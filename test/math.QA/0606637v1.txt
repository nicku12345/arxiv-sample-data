We compute t--analogs of q--characters of all l--fundamental representations of the quantum affine algebras of type E_6^{(1)}, E_7^{(1)}, E_8^{(1)} by a supercomputer. In particular, we prove the fermionic formula for Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules conjectured by Hatayama et al. (math.QA/9812022) for these classes of representations. We also give explicitly the monomial realization of the crystal of the corresponding fundamental representations of the qunatum enveloping algebras associated with finite dimensional Lie algebras of types E_6, E_7, E_8. These are computations of Betti numbers of graded quiver varieties, quiver varieties and determination of all irreducible components of the lagrangian subvarities of quiver varieties of types E_6, E_7, E_8 respectively.
