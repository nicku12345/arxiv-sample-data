We study the construction of premonoidal categories, where the pentagon relation fails, through representations of finite group algebras and their quantum doubles. Both finite group algebras and their quantum doubles have a finite number of irreducible representations. We show that in each case there are at least 2^{n-1} inequivalent premonoidal categories of representations, where n is the number of irreducible representations. By construction, for the case of finite group algebras the categories are symmetric whereas for the quantum doubles the categories are braided.
