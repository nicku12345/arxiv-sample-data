In this paper we study a family of commutative algebras generated by two infinite sets of generators. These algebras are parametrized by Young diagrams. We explain a connection of these algebras with the fusion product of integrable irreducible representations of the affine sl_2 Lie algebra. As an application we derive a fermionic formula for the character of the affine fusion product of two modules. These fusion products can be considered as a simplest example of the double affine Demazure modules.
