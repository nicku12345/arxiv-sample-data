We define a new kind quantized enveloping algebra of a generalized Kac-Moody algebra {\mathcal G} by adding a new generator J satisfying J^m=J for some integer m. We denote this algebra by wU_q^{\tau}({\mathcal G}). This algebra is a weak Hopf algebra if and only if m=2,3. In general, it is a bialgebra, and contains a Hopf subalgebra. This Hopf subalgebra is isomorphic to the usually quantum envelope algebra U_q({\mathcal G}) of a generalized Kac-Moody algebra {\mathcal G}.
