Properties of (most general) non-commutative torsors or A-B torsors are analysed. Starting with pre-torsors it is shown that they are equivalent to a certain class of Galois extensions of algebras by corings. It is shown that a class of faithfully flat pre-torsors induces equivalences between categories of comodules of associated corings. It is then proven that A-B torsors correspond to monoidal functors (and, under some additional conditions, equivalences) between categories of comodules of bialgebroids.
