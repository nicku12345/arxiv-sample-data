We review the relation between the Hopf algebra QSym of quasi-symmetric functions and the multiple zeta values, and then discuss a commutative diagram involving the Hopf algebra Sym of symmetric functions, the Hopf algebra dual NSym of QSym, and the Hopf algebras of rooted trees and planar rooted trees as defined by Kreimer and Foissy respectively.
