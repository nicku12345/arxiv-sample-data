The spectral decomposition of regular sl_2-invariant R-matrices R(lambda) is studied by means of the method of reduction of the Yang-Baxter equation onto subspaces of a given spin. Restrictions on the possible structure of several highest coefficients in the spectral decomposition are derived. The origin and structure of the exceptional solution in the case of spin s=3 are explained. Analogous analysis is performed for constant R--matrices. In particular, it is shown that the permutation matrix P is a ``rigid'' solution.
