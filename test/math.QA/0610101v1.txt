We give a modular branching rule for certain wreath products as a generalization of Kleshchev's modular branching rule for the symmetric groups. Our result contains a modular branching rule for the complex reflection groups G(m,1,n) (which are often called the generalized symmetric groups) in splitting fields for \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}. Especially for m=2 (which is the case of the Weyl groups of type B), we can give a modular branching rule in any field. Our proof is elementary in that it is essentially a combination of Frobenius reciprocity, Mackey theorem, Clifford's theory and Kleshchev's modular branching rule.
