It is a fairly known fact that most of the algebras appearing in the theory of rings of differential operators, quantized algebras of different kinds (including many quantum groups), regular algebras in projective non-commutative geometry, etc... come equipped with a natural gradation or filtration controlled by some finite dimensional vector space(s), e.g. the degree one part of filtration or gradation. In this note we relate the valuations of the algebras considered to unramified sub-lattices in some vector space(s).
