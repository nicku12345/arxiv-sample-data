We introduce the notions of open-closed field algebra and open-closed field algebra over a vertex operator algebra V. In the case that V satisfies certain finiteness and reductivity conditions, we show that an open-closed field algebra over V canonically gives an algebra over a \C-extension of the Swiss-cheese partial operad. We also give a tensor categorical formulation and categorical constructions of open-closed field algebras over V.
