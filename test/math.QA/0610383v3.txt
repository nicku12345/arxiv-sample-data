An integral formula for the solutions of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation with values in an arbitrary irreducible representation of the symmetric group S_N is presented for integer values of the parameter. The corresponding integrals can be computed effectively as certain iterated residues determined by a given Young diagram and give polynomials with integer coefficients. The derivation is based on Schur-Weyl duality and the results of Matsuo on the original SU(n) KZ equation. The duality between the spaces of solutions with parameters m and -m is discussed in relation with the intersection pairing in the corresponding homology groups.
