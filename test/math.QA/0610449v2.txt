We investigate the affine canonical basis and the monomial basis constructed in [LXZ] in Lusztig's geometric setting. We show that the transition matrix between the two bases is upper triangular with 1's in the diagonal and coefficients in the upper diagonal entries in N[v, v^{-1}]. As a consequence, we show that part of the monomial basis elements give rise to resolutions of support varieties of the affine canonical basis elements as simple perverse sheaves.
