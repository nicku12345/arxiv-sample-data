In this article, we study isomorphisms between simple current extensions of a simple VOA. For example, we classify the isomorphism classes of simple current extensions of some VOAs. Moreover, we consider the same simple current extension and describe the normalizer of the abelian automorphism group associated with this extension. In particular, we regard the moonshine module as simple current extensions of five subVOAs V_L^+ for 2-elementary totally even lattices L, and describe corresponding five normalizers of elementary abelian 2-group in the automorphism group of the moonshine module in terms of V_L^+. By using this description, we show that three of them form a Monster amalgam.
