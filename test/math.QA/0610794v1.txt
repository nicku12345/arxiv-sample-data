We study quantum Schubert varieties from the point of view of regularity conditions. More precisely, we show that these rings are domains which are maximal orders and are AS-Cohen-Macaulay and we determine which of them are AS-Gorenstein. One key fact that enables us to prove these results is that quantum Schubert varieties are quantum graded algebras with a straightening law that have a unique minimal element in the defining poset. We prove a general result showing when such quantum graded algebras are maximal orders. Finally, we exploit these results to show that quantum determinantal rings are maximal orders.
