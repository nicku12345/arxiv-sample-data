A perfect crystal of any level is constructed for the Kirillov-Reshetikhin module of U_q(D_4^{(3)}) corresponding to the middle vertex of the Dynkin diagram. The actions of Kashiwara operators are given explicitly. It is also shown that this family of perfect crystals is coherent. A uniqueness problem solved in this paper can be applied to other quantum affine algebras.
