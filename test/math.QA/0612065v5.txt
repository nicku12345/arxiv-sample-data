The cyclotomic Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebras are quotients of the affine BMW algebras in which the affine generator satisfies a polynomial relation. We study admissibility conditions on the ground ring for these algebras, and show that the algebras defined over an admissible integral ground ring S are free S--modules and isomorphic to cyclotomic Kauffman tangle algebras. We also determine the representation theory in the generic semisimple case, obtain a recursive formula for the weights of the Markov trace, and give a sufficient condition for semisimplicity.
