We prove that all finite W-algebras associated with nilpotent elements e in a complex semisimple Lie algebra g have finite-dimensional representations. In order to obtain this result we establish a connection between primitive ideals of U(g) attached to the nilpotent orbit containing e and finite-dimensional representations of the reduced enveloping algebra assiciated with e over an algebraically closed field of finite characteristic.
