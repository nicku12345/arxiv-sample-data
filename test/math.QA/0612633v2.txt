Comodule algebras of a Hopf algebroid H with a bijective antipode, i.e. algebra extensions B\subseteq A by H, are studied. Assuming that a lifted canonical map is a split epimorphism of modules of the non-commutative base algebra of H, relative injectivity of the H-comodule algebra A is related to the Galois property of the extension B\subseteq A and also to the equivalence of the category of relative Hopf modules to the category of B-modules. This extends a classical theorem by H.-J. Schneider on Galois extensions by a Hopf algebra. Our main tool is an observation that relative injectivity of a comodule algebra is equivalent to relative separability of a forgetful functor, a notion introduced and analysed hereby.   In the first version of this submission, we heavily used the statement that two constituent bialgebroids in a Hopf algebroid possess isomorphic comodule categories. This statement was based on \cite[Brz3,Theorem 2.6], whose proof turned out to contain an unjustified step. In the revised version we return to an earlier definition of a comodule of a Hopf algebroid, that distinguishes between comodules of the two constituent bialgebroids, and modify the statements and proofs in the paper accordingly.
