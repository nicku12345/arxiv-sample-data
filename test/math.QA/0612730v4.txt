Zhedanov's algebra AW(3) is considered with explicit structure constants such that, in the basic representation, the first generator becomes the second order q-difference operator for the Askey-Wilson polynomials. It is proved that this representation is faithful for a certain quotient of AW(3) such that the Casimir operator is equal to a special constant. Some explicit aspects of the double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) related to symmetric and non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials are presented and proved without requiring knowledge of general DAHA theory. Finally a central extension of this quotient of AW(3) is introduced which can be embedded in the DAHA by means of the faithful basic representations of both algebras.
