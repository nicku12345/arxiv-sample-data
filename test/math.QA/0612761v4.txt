We show that a nondegenerate unitary solution r(u,v) of the associative Yang-Baxter equation (AYBE) for \Mat(N,\C) (see math.AG/0008156) with the Laurent series at u=0 of the form r(u,v)=\frac{1\ot 1}{u}+r_0(v)+... satisfies the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, provided the projection of r_0(v) to traceless matrices has a period. We classify all such solutions of the AYBE extending the work of Schedler math.QA/0212258. We also characterize solutions coming from triple Massey products in the derived category of coherent sheaves on cycles of projective lines.
