All polynomial invariants of links for two dimensional solutions of Yang-Baxter equation is constructed by employing Turaev's method. As a consequence, it is proved that the best invariant so constructed is the Jones polynomial and there exist three solutions connecting to the Alexander polynomial. Invariants for higher dimensional solutions, obtained by the so-called dressings, are also investigated. It is observed that the dressings do not improve link invariant unless some restrictions are put on dressed solutions.
