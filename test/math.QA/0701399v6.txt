The aim of this paper is to introduce and study Lie algebras and Lie groups over noncommutative rings. For any Lie algebra \gg sitting inside an associative algebra A and any associative algebra \FF we introduce and study the algebra (\gg,A)(\FF), which is the Lie subalgebra of \FF \otimes A generated by \FF \otimes \gg. In many examples A is the universal enveloping algebra of \gg. Our description of the algebra (\gg,A)(\FF) has a striking resemblance to the commutator expansions of \FF used by M. Kapranov in his approach to noncommutative geometry. To each algebra (\gg, A)(\FF) we associate a ``noncommutative algebraic'' group which naturally acts on (\gg,A)(\FF) by conjugations and conclude the paper with some examples of such groups.
