Let (H, \sigma) be a coquasitriangular Hopf algebra, not necessarily finite dimensional. Following methods of Doi and Takeuchi, which parallel the constructions of Radford in the case of finite dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebras, we define H_\sigma, a sub-Hopf algebra of H^0, the finite dual of H. Using the generalized quantum double construction and the theory of Hopf algebras with a projection, we associate to H a braided Hopf algebra structure in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H_\sigma^{\rm cop}. Specializing to H={\rm SL}_q(N), we obtain explicit formulas which endow {\rm SL}_q(N) with a braided Hopf algebra structure within the category of left Yetter-Drinfeld modules over U_q^{\rm ext}({\rm sl}_N)^{\rm cop}.
