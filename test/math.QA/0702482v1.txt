The aim of this paper is to give a complete classification of irreducible finite dimensional representations of the nonstandard q-deformation U'_q(so(n)) (which does not coincide with the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum algebra U_q(so(n)) of the universal enveloping algebra U(so(n,C)) of the Lie algebra so(n,C) when q is not a root of unity. These representations are exhausted by irreducible representations of the classical type and of the nonclassical type. Theorem on complete reducibility of finite dimensional representations of U'_q(so(n)) is proved.
