Mednykh proved that for any finite group G and any orientable surface S, there is a formula for #Hom(pi_1(S), G) in terms of the Euler characteristic of S and the dimensions of the irreducible representations of G. A similar formula in the nonorientable case was proved by Frobenius and Schur. Both of these proofs use character theory and an explicit presentation for \pi_1. These results have been reproven using quantum field theory. Here we present a greatly simplified proof of these results which uses only elementary topology and combinatorics. The main tool is an elementary invariant of surfaces attached to a semisimple algebra called a lattice topological quantum field theory.
