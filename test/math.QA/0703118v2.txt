We classify the compact quantum groups acting on 4 points. These are the quantum subgroups of the quantum permutation group \mathcal Q_4. Our main tool is a new presentation for the algebra \rm C(\mathcal Q_4), corresponding to an isomorphism of type \mathcal Q_4\simeq SO_{-1}(3). The quantum subgroups of \mathcal Q_4 are subject to a McKay type correspondence, that we describe at the level of algebraic invariants.
