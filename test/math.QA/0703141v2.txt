This work is a continuation of the former paper in which principal bundles are given by compact spin toric manifolds and compact connected semisimple Lie groups. In this paper, ambient manifolds are assumed to be compact toric manifolds and Lie groups are compact connected. The main result is that locally smooth manifolds are the instanton moduli spaces of the noncommutative vector bundles over noncommutative 4-manifolds associated with highest weights of the compact Lie groups. Moreover their dimensions are described explicitly in terms of given principal bundles and highest weights. As a corollary, it is shown that a smooth 4-manifold is the instanton moduli space of the canonocal noncommutative vector bundle over the noncommutative comples projective 2-space associated with the highest weight 1 of the 1-torus.
