We survey Hopf algebras and their generalizations. In particular, we compare and contrast three well-studied generalizations (quasi-Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras, and Hopf algebroids), and two newer ones (Hopf monads and hopfish algebras). Each of these notions was originally introduced for a specific purpose within a particular context; our discussion favors applicability to the theory of dynamical quantum groups. Throughout the note, we provide several definitions and examples in order to make this exposition accessible to readers with differing backgrounds.
