We introduce an analogue of the composition of the Cherednik and Drinfeld functor for twisted Yangians. Our definition is based on the Howe duality, and originates from the centralizer construction of twisted Yangians due to Olshanski. Using our functor, we establish a correspondence between intertwining operators on the tensor products of certain modules over twisted Yangians, and the extremal cocycle on the hyperoctahedral group.
