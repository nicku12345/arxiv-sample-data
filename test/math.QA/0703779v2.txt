This article gives matrix factorizations for the trivalent diagrams and double line appearing in \mathfrak{sl}_n quantum link invariant.   These matrix factorizations reconstruct Khovanov-Rozansky homology. And we show that the Euler characteristic of the matrix factorization for a double loop equals the quantum dimension of the representation \land^2 V of U_q (\mathfrak{sl}_n) in Section \ref{sec3.3}.
