Twisted tensor powers of quasitriangular Hopf algebras with diagonal sub-Hopf-algebras (self-diagonal tensor powers) are introduced together with their duals and their mutual *-structures as generalizations of the Drinfel'd double as given by Reshetikhin and Semenov-Tian-Shansky. R-Matrices for tensor products of representations are derived.
