General braided counterparts of classical Clifford algebras are introduced and investigated. Braided Clifford algebras are defined as Chevalley-Kahler deformations of the corresponding braided exterior algebras. Analogs of the spinor representations are studied, generalizing classical Cartan's approach. It is shown that, under certain assumptions concerning the braiding, the spinor representation is faithful and irreducible, as in the classical theory.
