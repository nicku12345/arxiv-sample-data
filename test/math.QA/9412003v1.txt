A braided generalization of the concept of Hopf algebra (quantum group) is presented. The generalization overcomes an inherent geometrical inhomogeneity of quantum groups, in the sense of allowing completely pointless objects. All braid-type equations appear as a consequence of initial axioms. Braided counterparts of basic algebraic relations between fundamental entities of the standard theory are found.
