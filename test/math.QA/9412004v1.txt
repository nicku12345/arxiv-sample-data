A constructive approach to differential calculus on quantum principal bundles is presented. The calculus on the bundle is built in an intrinsic manner, starting from given graded (differential) *-algebras representing horizontal forms on the bundle and differential forms on the base manifold, together with a family of antiderivations acting on horizontal forms, playing the role of covariant derivatives of regular connections. In this conceptual framework, a natural differential calculus on the structure quantum group is described.
