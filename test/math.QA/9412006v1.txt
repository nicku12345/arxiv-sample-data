A noncommutative-geometric generalization of the classical concept of spinor structure is presented. This is done in the framework of the formalism of quantum principal bundles. In particular, analogs of the Dirac operator and the Laplacian are introduced and analyzed. A general construction of examples of quantum spaces with a spinor structure is presented.
