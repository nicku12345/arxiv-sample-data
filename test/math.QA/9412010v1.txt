We discuss the left-covariant 3-dimensional differential calculus on the quantum sphere SU_q (2)/U(1) . The SU_q (2)-spinor harmonics are treated as coordinates of the quantum sphere. We consider the gauge theory for the quantum group SU_q (2)\times U(1)  on the deformed Euclidean space E_q (4). A q-generalization of the harmonic-gauge-field formalism is suggested . This formalism is applied for the harmonic (twistor) interpretation of the quantum-group self-duality equation (QGSDE). We consider the zero-curvature representation and the general construction of QGSDE-solutions in terms of the analytic prepotential.
