Let  \Bbb V = \coprod_{h = 0}^{\infty} \Bbb V_h be the graded monster module of the monster simple group \Bbb M and let \chi_k be an irreducible representation of \Bbb M. The generating function of c_{hk} (the multiplicity of \chi_k in \Bbb V_h) is determined. Furthermore, the invariance group of the modular function associated with the generating function is also determined in this paper.
