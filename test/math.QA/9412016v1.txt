In the previous author's paper the Macdonald norm conjecture (including the famous constant term conjecture) was proved. This paper contains the proof of the remaining two (the duality and evaluation conjectures). The evaluation theorem is in fact a q,t-generalization of the classic Weyl dimension formula. As to the duality theorem, it states that the generalized trigonometric-difference zonal Fourier transform is self-dual (at least formally). We define this transform in terms of double affine Hecke algebras related to elliptic braid groups. The duality appeared to be directly connected with the transposition of the periods of an elliptic curve.
