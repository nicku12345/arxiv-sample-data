Let R be a commutative ring, q a unit of R and P a multiplicatively antisymmetric matrix with coefficients which are integers powers of q. Denote by SE(q,P) the multiparameter quantum matrix bialgebra associated to q and P.Slightly generalizing [Hashimoto-Hayashi,Tohoku Math.Tohoku Math.J. 44(1992)],we define a multiparameter deformation L_{\l/\mu}V_P of the classical skew Schur module.In case R is a field and q is not a root of 1, arguments like those given in [H-H] show that L_{\l/\mu}V_P is irreducible and its decomposition into irreducibles is \sum_\nu c(\l/\mu;\nu)L_\nu V_P where the coefficients are the usual Littlewood-Richardson ones. When R is any ring and q is allowed to be a root of 1, we construct a filtration of L_{\l/\mu}V_P as an SE(q,P)-comodule, such that its associated graded object is precisely \sum_\nu c(\l/\mu;\nu)L_\nu V_P.
