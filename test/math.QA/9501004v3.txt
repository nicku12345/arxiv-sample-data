Let (V,Z) be a Topological Quantum Field Theory over a field f defined on a cobordism category whose morphisms are oriented n+1-manifolds perhaps with extra structure. Let (M,\chi) be a closed oriented n+1-manifold M with this extra structure together with \chi \in H^1(M). Let M_{\infty} denote the infinite cyclic cover of M given by \chi. Consider a fundamental domain E for the action of the integers on M_{\infty} bounded by lifts of a surface \Sigma dual to \chi, and in general position. E can be viewed as a cobordism from \Sigma to itself. We give Turaev and Viro's proof of their theorem that the similarity class of the non-nilpotent part of Z(E) is an invariant. We give a method to calculate this invariant for the (V_p,Z_p) theories of Blanchet,Habegger, Masbaum and Vogel when M is zero framed surgery to S^3 along a knot K. We give a formula for this invariant when K is a twisted double of another knot. We obtain formulas for the quantum invariants of branched covers of knots, and unbranched covers of 0-surgery to S^3 along knots.
