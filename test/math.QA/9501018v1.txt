A new notion of an optimal algebra for a first order coordinate differential was introduced in \cite{BKO}. Some relevant examples are indicated. Quadratic identities in the optimal algebras and calculi on quadratic algebras are studied. Canonical construction of a quantum de Rham complex for the coordinate differential is proposed. The relations between calculi and various generalizations of the Yang--Baxter equation are established.
