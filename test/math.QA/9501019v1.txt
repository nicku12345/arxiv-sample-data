Quadratic Poisson brackets on associative algebras are studied. Such a bracket compatible with the multiplication is related to a differentiation in tensor square of the underlying algebra. Jacobi identity means that this differentiation satisfies a classical Yang--Baxter equation. Corresponding Lie groups are canonically equipped with a Poisson Lie structure. A way to quantize such structures is suggested.
