We recall the relation between the Lie superalgebra osp(1/2n) and para-Bose operators. The quantum superalgebra U_q[osp(1/2n)], defined as usual in terms of its Chevalley generators, is shown to be isomorphic to an associative algebra generated by so-called pre-oscillator operators satisfying a number of relations. From these relations, and the analogue with the non-deformed case, one can interpret these pre-oscillator operators as deformed para-Bose operators. Some consequences for U_q[osp(1/2n)] (Cartan-Weyl basis, Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis) and its Hopf subalgebra U_q[gl(n)] are pointed out. Finally, using a realization in terms of ``q-commuting'' q-bosons, we construct an irreducible finite-dimensional unitary Fock representation of U_q[osp(1/2n)] and its decomposition in terms of U_q[gl(n)] representations when q is a root of unity.
