The Hopf algebra dual form for the non--standard uniparametric deformation of the (1+1) Poincar\'e algebra iso(1,1) is deduced. In this framework, the quantum coordinates that generate Fun_w(ISO(1,1)) define an infinite dimensional Lie algebra. A change in the basis of the dual form is obtained in order to compare this deformation to the standard one. Finally, a non--standard quantum Heisenberg group acting on a quantum Galilean plane is obtained.
