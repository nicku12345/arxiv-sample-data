A universal quasitriangular R--matrix for the non-standard quantum (1+1) Poincar\'e algebra U_ziso(1,1) is deduced by imposing analyticity in the deformation parameter z. A family g_\mu of ``quantum graded contractions" of the algebra U_ziso(1,1)\oplus U_{-z}iso(1,1) is obtained; this set of quantum algebras contains as Hopf subalgebras with two primitive translations quantum analogues of the two dimensional Euclidean, Poincar\'e and Galilei algebras enlarged with dilations. Universal R--matrices   for these quantum Weyl algebras and their associated quantum groups are constructed.
