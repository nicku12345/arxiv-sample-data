A new approach to the theory of polynomial solutions of q - difference equations is proposed. The approach is based on the representation theory of simple Lie algebras and their q - deformations and is presented here for U_q(sl(n)). First a q - difference realization of U_q(sl(n)) in terms of n(n-1)/2 commuting variables and depending on n-1 complex representation parameters r_i, is constructed. From this realization lowest weight modules (LWM) are obtained which are studied in detail for the case n=3 (the well known n=2 case is also recovered). All reducible LWM are found and the polynomial bases of their invariant irreducible subrepresentations are explicitly given. This also gives a classification of the quasi-exactly solvable operators in the present setting. The invariant subspaces are obtained as solutions of certain invariant q - difference equations, i.e., these are kernels of invariant q - difference operators, which are also explicitly given. Such operators were not used until now in the theory of polynomial solutions. Finally the states in all subrepresentations are depicted graphically via the so called Newton diagrams.
