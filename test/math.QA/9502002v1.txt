We investigate the possibility to construct bicovariant differential calculi on quantum groups SO_q(N) and Sp_q(N) as a quantization of an underlying bicovariant bracket.We show that, opposite to GL(N) and SL(N)-cases, neither of possible graded SO- and Sp- bicovariant brackets (associated with a quasitriangular r-matrices) obey the Jacobi identity when the differential forms are Lie algebra- valued. The absence of a classical Poisson structure gives an indication that differential algebras describing bicovariant differential calculi on quantum orthogonal and symplectic groups are not of Poincar'e- Birkhoff- -Witt type.
