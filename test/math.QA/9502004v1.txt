The characters \chi_\mu of nontwisted affine algebras at fixed level define in a natural way a representation R of the modular group SL_2(Z). The matrices in the image R(SL_2(Z)) are called the Kac-Peterson modular matrices, and describe the modular behaviour of the characters. In this paper we consider all levels of (A_{r_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus A_{r_s})^{(1)}, and for each of these find all permutations of the highest weights which commute with the corresponding Kac-Peterson matrices. This problem is equivalent to the classification of automorphism invariants of conformal field theories, and its solution, especially considering its simplicity, is a major step toward the classification of all Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories.
