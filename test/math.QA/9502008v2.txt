We study certain family of finite-dimensional modules over the Yangian Y(gl_N). The algebra Y(gl_N) comes equipped with a distinguished maximal commutative subalgebra A(gl_n) generated by the centres of all algebras in the chain Y(gl_1)\subset Y(gl_2)\subset...\subset Y(gl_N). We study the finite-dimensional Y(gl_N)-modules with a semisimple action of the subalgebra A(gl_N). We call these modules tame.   We provide a characterization of irreducible tame modules in terms of their Drinfeld polynomials. We prove that every irreducible tame module splits into a tensor product of modules corresponding to the skew Young diagrams and some one-dimensional module.   The eigenbases of A(gl_N) in irreducible tame modules are called Gelfand-Zetlin bases. We provide explicit formulas for the action of the Drinfeld generators of the algebra Y(gl_N) on the vectors of Gelfand-Zetlin bases.
