The braided approach to q-deformation (due to the author and collaborators) gives natural algebras R_{21}u_1Ru_2=u_2R_{21}u_1R and R_{21}x_1x_2=x_2x_1R for q-Minkowski and q-Euclidean spaces respectively. These algebras are covariant under a corresponding background `rotation' quantum group. Semidirect product by this according to the bosonisation procedure (also due to the author) gives the corresponding Poincar\'e quantum groups. We review the construction and collect the resulting R-matrix formulae for both Euclidean and Minkowski cases in both enveloping algebra and function algebra form, and the duality between them. Axioms for the Poincar\'e quantum group *-structure and the dilaton problem are discussed.
