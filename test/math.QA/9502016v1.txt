To each partition \frak p of n we associate in a canonical way a simple S_n module with an orthogonal basis indexed by Young diagrams in a way which carries over immediately to the quantized case. With this we show that the Hecke algebra of S_n is a global solution to the Donald--Flanigan problem for S_n. The procedure gives ``canonical'' primitive idempotents different from the classical ones of Frobenius--Young and makes some number--theoretic statements.
