A new quantum deformation, which we call null-plane, of the (3+1) Poincar\'e algebra is obtained. The algebraic properties of the classical null-plane description are generalized to this quantum deformation. In particular, the classical isotopy subalgebra of the null-plane is deformed into a Hopf subalgebra, and deformed spin operators having classical commutation rules can be defined. Quantum Hamiltonian, mass and position operators are studied, and the null-plane evolution is expressed in terms of a deformed Schr\"odinger equation.
