We give an expression of the q-analogues of the multiplicities of weights in irreducible \sl_{n+1}-modules in terms of the geometry of the crystal graph attached to the corresponding U_q(\sl_{n+1})-modules. As an application, we describe multivariate polynomial analogues of the multiplicities of the zero weight, refining Kostant's generalized exponents.
