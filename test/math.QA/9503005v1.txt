It is shown that the Heisenberg double has a canonical element, satisfying the pentagon relation. From a given invertible constant solution to the pentagon relation one can restore the structure of the underlying algebras. Drinfeld double can be realized as a subalgebra in the tensor square of the Heisenberg double. This enables one to write down solutions to the Yang-Baxter relation in terms of solutions to the pentagon relation.
