This article is a sequel to hep-th/9411050, q-alg/9412017.   In Chapter 1 we associate with every Cartan matrix of finite type and a non-zero complex number \zeta an abelian artinian category \FS. We call its objects {\em finite factorizable sheaves}. They are certain infinite collections of perverse sheaves on configuration spaces, subject to a compatibility ("factorization") and finiteness conditions.   In Chapter 2 the tensor structure on \FS is defined using functors of nearby cycles. It makes \FS a braided tensor category.   In Chapter 3 we define, using vanishing cycles functors, an exact tensor functor \Phi:\FS\lra\CC to the category \CC connected with the corresponding quantum group.   In Chapter 4 we show that \Phi is an equivalence. Some proofs are only sketched.
