We use braided groups to introduce a theory of *-structures on general inhomogeneous quantum groups, which we formulate as {\em quasi-*} Hopf algebras. This allows the construction of the tensor product of unitary representations up to a quantum cocycle isomorphism, which is a novel feature of the inhomogeneous case. Examples include q-Poincar\'e quantum group enveloping algebras in R-matrix form appropriate to the previous q-Euclidean and q-Minkowski spacetime algebras R_{21}x_1x_2=x_2x_1R and R_{21}u_1Ru_2=u_2R_{21}u_1R. We obtain unitarity of the fundamental differential representations. We show further that the Euclidean and Minkowski Poincar\'e quantum groups are twisting equivalent by a another quantum cocycle.
