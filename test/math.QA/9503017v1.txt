Phase-space realisations of an infinite parameter family of quantum deformations of the boson algebra in which the q-- and the qp--deformed algebras arise as special cases are studied. Quantum and classical models for the corresponding deformed oscillators are provided. The deformation parameters are identified with coefficients of non-linear terms in the normal forms expansion of a family of classical Hamiltonian systems. These quantum deformations are trivial in the sense that they correspond to non-unitary transformations of the Weyl algebra. They are non-trivial in the sense that the deformed commutators consistently quantise a class of non-canonical classical Poisson structures.
