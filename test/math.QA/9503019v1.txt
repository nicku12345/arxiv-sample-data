The paper is devoted to the Poisson brackets compatible with multiplication in associative algebras. These brackets are shown to be quadratic and their relations with the classical Yang--Baxter equation are revealed. The paper also contains a description of Poisson Lie structures on Lie groups whose Lie algebras are adjacent to an associative structure.
