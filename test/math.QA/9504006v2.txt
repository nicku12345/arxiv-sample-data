The Gelfand--Zetlin basis for representations of U_q(sl(N)) is improved to fit better the case when q is a root of unity. The usual q-deformed representations, as well as the nilpotent, periodic (cyclic), semi-periodic (semi-cyclic) and also some atypical representations are now described with the same formalism.
