We clarify the relation between the `bosonisation' construction (due to the author) which can be used to turn a Hopf algebra B in the category of H-modules or H-comodules into an equivalent ordinary Hopf algebra, and a version of Radfords theorem (also due in this form to the author) which does the same for B in the category of crossed H-modules. We also comment on reconstruction from the category of B-comodules.
