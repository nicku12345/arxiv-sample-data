We define a natural quantum analogue for the {\cal Z} algebra, and which we refer to as the {\cal Z}_q algebra, by modding out the Heisenberg algebra from the quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat{sl(2)}) with level k. We discuss the representation theory of this {\cal Z}_q algebra. In particular, we exhibit its reduction to a group algebra, and to a tensor product of a group algebra with a quantum Clifford algebra when k=1, and k=2, and thus, we recover the explicit constructions of \uq-standard modules as achieved by Frenkel-Jing and Bernard, respectively. Moreover, for arbitrary nonzero level k, we show that the explicit basis for the simplest {\cal Z}-generalized Verma module as constructed by Lepowsky and primc is also a basis for its corresponding {\cal Z}_q-module, i.e., it is invariant under the q-deformation for generic q. We expect this {\cal Z}_q algebra (associated with \uq at level k), to play the role of a dynamical symmetry in the off-critical  Z_k statistical models.
