The level 1 highest weight modules of the quantum affine algebra U_q(\widehat{\frak{sl}}_n) can be described as spaces of certain semi-infinite wedges. Using a q-antisymmetrization procedure, these semi-infinite wedges can be realized inside an infinite tensor product of evaluation modules. This realization gives rise to simple descriptions of vertex operators and (up to a scalar function) their compositions.
