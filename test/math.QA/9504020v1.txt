The link invariant, arising from the cyclic quantum dilogarithm via the particular R-matrix construction, is proved to coincide with the invariant of triangulated links in S^3 introduced in R.M. Kashaev, Mod. Phys. Lett. A, Vol.9 No.40 (1994) 3757. The obtained invariant, like Alexander-Conway polynomial, vanishes on disjoint union of links. The R-matrix can be considered as the cyclic analog of the universal R-matrix associated with U_q(sl(2)) algebra.
