In our paper [Markl, Shnider: Drinfel'd Algebra Deformations and the Associahedra, IMRN 1994, no. 4, 169-176] we announced a construction of a cohomology controlling deformations of quasi-coassociative (or Drinfel'd) bialgebras. The full version of the paper will appear as [Markl, Shnider: Drinfel'd Algebra Deformations, Homotopy Comodules and the Associahedra] in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. The construction in the paper was based on very explicit arguments using deep combinatorial properties of the associahedra. The present paper gives an alternative, general nonsense approach to the construction. So, we just prove the existence of such a cohomology without explicitly constructing it. This should be compared with the two approaches to the cohomology of associative algebras: we either describe explicitly the Hochschild complex and say "Behold! this is the cohomology" or we prove the existence of a projective resolution and define the cohomology as the derived functor.
