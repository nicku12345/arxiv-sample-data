The Universal T-matrix is the capstone of the structure that consists of a quantum group and its dual, and the central object from which spring the T-matrices (monodromies) of all the associated integrable models. A closed expression is obtained for the case of multiparameter (twisted) quantum gl(N). The factorized nature of standard quantum groups, that allows the explicit expression for U\hskip-1mm T  to be obtained with relative ease, extends to some nonstandard quantum groups, such as those based on A_n^{(2)}, and perhaps to all. The paper is mostly concerned with parameters in general position, but the extension to roots of unity is also explored, in the case of g\ell(N). The structure of the dual is now radically different, and an interesting generalization of the q-exponential appears in the formulas for the Universal T- and R-matrices. The projection to quantum sl(N) is simple and direct; this allows, in particular, to apply recent results concerning deformations of twisted gl(N) to the semisimple quotient.
