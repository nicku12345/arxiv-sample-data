Let V be a finite dimensional vector space. Given a decomposition V\otimes V=\oplus_i^n I_i, define n quadratic algebras (V, J_m) where J_m=\oplus_{i\neq m} I_i. This decomposition defines also the quantum semigroup M(V;I_1,...,I_n) which acts on all these quadratic algebras. With the decomposition we associate a family of associative algebras A_k=A_k(I_1,...I_n), k\geq 2. In the classical case, when V\otimes V decomposes into the symmetric and skewsymmetric tensors, A_k coincides with the group algebra of the symmetric group S_k. Let I_{ih} be deformations of the subspaces I_i. In the paper we give a criteria for flatness of the corresponding deformations of the quadratic algebras (V[[h]],J_{ih} and the quantum semigroup M(V[[h]];I_{1h},...,I_{nh}). It says that the deformations will be flat if the algebras A_k(I_1,...,I_n) are semisimple and under the deformation their dimension does not change.   Usually, the decomposition into I_i is defined by a given Yang-Baxter operator S on V\otimes V, for which I_i are its eigensubspaces, and the deformations I_{ih} are defined by a deformation S_h of S. We consider the cases when S_h is a deformation of Hecke or Birman-Wenzl symmetry, and also the case when S_h is the Yang-Baxter operator which appears by a representation of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group. Applying the flatness criteria we prove that in all these cases we obtain flat deformations of the quadratic algebras and the corresponding quantum semigroups.
