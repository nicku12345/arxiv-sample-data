We prove that the knot invariant induced by a \Bbb Z-homology 3-sphere invariant of order \leq k in Ohtsuki's sense, where k\geq 4, is of order \leq k-2. The method developed in our computation shows that there is no \Bbb Z-homology 3-sphere invariant of order 5. This result agrees with a conjecture of Rozansky based on physical predictions about the asymptotic behavior of Witten's Chern-Simons path integral.
