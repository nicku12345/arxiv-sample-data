This paper is on C - symmetric creation and annihilation operators, which are constructed on Wick's algebras which fulfil consistency conditions. The essential assumption is that every algebraic action must be constant on equivalence classes. All consistency conditions follow from the above assumption. In this way we obtain well defined quotient algebras with some additional relations.
