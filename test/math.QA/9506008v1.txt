We study the problem of classifying all Poisson-Lie structures on the group G_{\infty} of formal diffeomorphisms of the real line \zR^{1} which leave the origin fixed, as well as the extended group of diffeomorphisms G_{0\infty}\supset G_{\infty} whose action on \zR^{1} does not necessarily fix the origin. A complete local classification of all Poisson-Lie structures on the groups G_{\infty} and G_{0\infty} is given. This includes a classification of all Lie-bialgebra structures on the Lie algebra \Cal G_{\infty} of G_{\infty}, which we prove to be all of coboundary type, and a classification of all Lie-bialgebra strucutures on the Lie algebra \Cal G_{0\infty} (the Witt algebra) of G_{0\infty} which also turned out to be all of coboundary type. A large class of Poisson structures on the space V_{\lambda} of \lambda-densities on the real line is found such that V_{\lambda} becomes a homogeneous Poisson space under the action of the Poisson-Lie group G_{\infty}. We construct a series of quantum semigroups whose quasiclassical limits are finite-dimensional Poisson-Lie factor groups of G_{\infty} and G_{0\infty}.
