This article is a sequel to hep-th/9411050, q-alg/9412017, q-alg/9503013. Given a collection of m finite factorizable sheaves \{\CX_k\}, we construct here some perverse sheaves over configuration spaces of points on a projective line \BP^1 with m additional marked points. We announce here (with sketch proof) the computation of the cohomology spaces of these sheaves. They turn out to coincide with certain "semiinfinite" \Tor spaces of the corresponding \fu-modules. As a corollary, we get a description of local systems of conformal blocks in WZW models in genus 0 (cf. ~\cite{ms}) as natural subquotients of some semisimple local systems of geometric origin. In particular, these local systems are semisimple themselves.
