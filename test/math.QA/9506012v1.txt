This paper continues the study of finite-type invariants of homology spheres studied by Ohtsuki and Garoufalidis. We apply the surgery classification of links to give a diagrammatic description, using ideas of Ohtsuki. This uses a computation of the surgery equivalence classes of pure braids. We show that the order of any invariant, in Ohtsukis sense, is a multiple of 3. We also study the relation between the order of an invariant and that of the knot invariant it defines.
