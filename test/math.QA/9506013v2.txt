Given an associative algebra A, and the category, \cC, of its finite dimensional modules, additional structures on the algebra A induce corresponding ones on the category \cC. Thus, the structure of a rigid quasi-tensor (braided monoidal) category on Rep_A is induced by an algebra homomorphism A\to A\otimes A (comultiplication), coassociative up to conjugation by \Phi\in A^{\otimes 3} (associativity constraint) and cocommutative up to conjugation by \cR\in A^{\otimes 2} (commutativity constraint), together with an antiautomorphism (antipode), S, of A satisfying the certain compatibility conditions. A morphism of quasi-tensor structures is given by an element F\in A^{\otimes 2} with suitable induced actions on \Phi, \cR and S. Drinfeld defined such a structure on A=U(\cG)[[h]] for any semisimple Lie algebra \cG with the usual comultiplication and antipode but nontrivial \cR and \Phi and proved that the corresponding quasi-tensor category is isomomorphic to the category of representations of the Drinfeld-Jimbo (DJ) quantum universal enveloping algebra (QUE), U_h(\cG).   In the paper we give a direct cohomological construction of the F which reduces \Phi to the trivial associativity constraint, without any assumption on the prior existence of a strictly coassociative QUE. Thus we get a new approach to the DJ quantization. We prove that F can be chosen to satisfy some additional invariance conditions under (anti)automorphisms of U(\cG)[[h]], in particular, F gives an isomorphism of rigid quasi-tensor categories. Moreover, we prove that for pure imaginary values of the deformation parameter, the elements F, R and \Phi can be chosen to be
