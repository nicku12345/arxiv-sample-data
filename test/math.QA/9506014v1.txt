We examine some issues that arise in the q-deformation of a gauge theory. If the deformation is carried out by replacing the equal time commutators of free fields by the corresponding q-commutators, the resulting propagators are not very much different from those of the undeformed theory as long as one is dealing with weak fields; but the theory still violates causality. If one postulates a q-deformed S matrix, the corresponding q-causal commutator has 2 poles of different strength and the result again amounts to a deformation of the Lorentz group.
