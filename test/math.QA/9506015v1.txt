We obtain the universal R-matrix of the non-standard quantum group associated to the Alexander-Conway knot polynomial. We show further that this non-standard quantum group is related to the super-quantum group U_qgl(1|1) by a general process of superization, which we describe. We also study a twisted variant of this non-standard quantum group and obtain, as a result, a twisted version of U_qgl(1|1) as a q-supersymmetry of the exterior differential calculus of any quantum plane of Hecke type, acting by mixing the bosonic x_i co-ordinates and the forms d x_i.
