Non-standard quantum groups C_R [GL(n)] and C_R [SL(n)] are constructed for a two parameter version of the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix. An epimorphism is constructed from C_R [GL(n)] onto the restricted dual U_{\bar{R}}(\frak{gl}(n-1)) associated to a related smaller R-matrix of the same form.   A related result is proved concerning factorizable Lie bialgebras. For any such Lie bialgebra, the dual Lie bialgebra has a canonical homomorphic image which is again factorizable.
