A recently proposed definition of a linear connection in non-commutative geometry, based on a generalized permutation, is used to construct linear connections on GL_q(n). Restrictions on the generalized permutation arising from the stability of linear connections under involution are discussed. Candidates for generalized permutation on GL_q(n) are found. It is shown that, for a given generalized permutation, there exists one and only one associated linear connection. Properties of the linear connection are discussed, in particular its bicovariance, torsion and commutative limit.
