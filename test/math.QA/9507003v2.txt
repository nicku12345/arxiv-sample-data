We study analogues of the Yangian of the Lie algebra gl_N for the other classical Lie algebras so_N and sp_N. We call them twisted Yangians. They are coideal subalgebras in the Yangian Y(gl_N) of gl_N and admit homomorphisms onto the universal enveloping algebras U(so_N) and U(sp_N) respectively. In every twisted Yangian we construct a family of maximal commutative subalgebras parametrized by the regular semisimple elements of the corresponding classical Lie algebra. The images in U(so_N) and U(sp_N) of these subalgebras are also maximal commutative.
