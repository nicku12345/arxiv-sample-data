We show that bicovariant bimodules as defined by Woronowicz are in one to one correspondence with the Drinfeld quantum double representations. We then prove that a differential calculus associated to a bicovariant bimodule of dimension n is connected to the existence of a particular (n+1)--dimensional representation of the double. An example of bicovariant differential calculus on the non quasitriangular quantum group E_q(2) is developed. The construction is studied in terms of Hochschild cohomology and a correspondence between differential calculi and 1-cocycles is proved. Some differences of calculi on quantum and finite groups with respect to Lie groups are stressed.
