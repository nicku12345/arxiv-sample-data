We propose a new structure {\cal U}^{r}_{\displaystyle{q}}(sl(2)) . This is realized by multiplying \delta (q=e^{\delta}, \delta\in \CC) by \theta, where \theta is a real nilpotent -paragrassmannian- variable of order r (\theta^{r+1}=0) that we call the order of deformation, the limit r\rightarrow \infty giving back the standard {\cal U}_{\displaystyle {q}}(sl(2)). In particular we show that, for r=1, there exists a new {\cal R}-matrix associated with sl(2). We also proof that the restriction of the values of the parameters of deformation give nonlinear algebras as particular cases.
