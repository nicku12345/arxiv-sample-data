For the quantum group GL_{p,q}(2) and the corresponding quantum algebra U_{p,q}(gl(2)) Fronsdal and Galindo explicitly constructed the so-called universal T-matrix. In a previous paper we showed how this universal T-matrix can be used to exponentiate representations from the quantum algebra to get representations (left comodules) for the quantum group. Here, further properties of the universal T-matrix are illustrated. In particular, it is shown how to obtain comodules of the quantum algebra by exponentiating modules of the quantum group. Also the relation with the universal R-matrix is discussed.
