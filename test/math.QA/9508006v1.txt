A decomposition of the level-one q-deformed Fock representations of \uqn is given. It is found that the action of \upqn on these Fock spaces is centralized by a Heisenberg algebra, which arises from the center of the affine Hecke algebra \widehat{H}_N in the limit N \rightarrow \infty. The q-deformed Fock space is shown to be isomorphic as a \upqn-Heisenberg-bimodule to the tensor product of a level-one irreducible highest weight representation of \upqn and the Fock representation of the Heisenberg algebra. The isomorphism is used to decompose the q-wedging operators, which are intertwiners between the q-deformed Fock spaces, into constituents coming from \upqn and from the Heisenberg algebra.
