We consider the conditions under which the q-oscillator algebra becomes a Hopf *-algebra. In particular, we show that there are at least two real forms associated with the algebra. Furthermore, through the representations, it is shown that they are related to {\text {su}}_{q^{1/2}}(2) with different conjugations.
