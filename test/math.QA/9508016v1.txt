The universal R-matrices and, dually, the coquasitriangular structures of the group Hopf algebra of a finite Abelian group (resp. of an arbitrary Abelian group) are determined. This is used to formulate graded multilinear algebra in terms of triangular or cotriangular Hopf algebras. For the convenience of the reader, in a separate section the definitions and basic properties of quasitriangular and coquasitriangular Hopf algebras are recalled.
