A method to calculate matrix representations of the twist element \ff of Drinfel'd -- chosen to be unitary -- is given and illustrated at some examples. It is observed that for these F-matrices the crystal limit q\!\to\! 0 exists and that \mbox{F-matrices} twisting from 0 to q are of a simpler form than F-matrices twisting from 1 to q. These results lead to a new interpretation of q-deformation in terms of tensor products of finite-dimensional representations of compact simple Lie groups.
