An attempt is made to conceptualize the derivation as well as to facilitate the computation of Ohtsuki's rational invariants \lambda_n of integral homology 3-spheres extracted from Reshetikhin-Turaev SU(2) quantum invariants. Several interesting consequences will follow from our computation of \lambda_2. One of them says that \lambda_2 is always an integer divisible by 3. It seems interesting to compare this result with the fact shown by Murakami that \lambda_{1} is 6 times the Casson invariant. Other consequences include some general criteria for distinguishing homology 3-spheres obtained from surgery on knots by using the Jones polynomial.
