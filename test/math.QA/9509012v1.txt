The fundumental invariant of the Hecke algebra H_{n}(q) is the q-deformed class-sum of transpositions of the symmetric group S_{n}. Irreducible representations of H_{n}(q), for generic q, are shown to be completely characterized by the corresponding eigenvalues of C_{n} alone. For S_{n} more and more invariants are necessary as n inereases. It is pointed out that the q-deformed classical quadratic Casimir of SU(N) plays an analogous role. It is indicated why and how this should be a general phenomenon associated with q-deformation of classical algebras. Apart from this remarkable conceptual aspect C_{n} can provide powerful and elegant techniques for computations. This is illustrated by using the sequence C_{2}, C_{3}, \cdots,\; C_{n} to compute the characters of H_{n}(q).
