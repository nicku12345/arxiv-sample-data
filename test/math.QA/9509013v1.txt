We define a q-analog of the modified Bessel and Bessel-Macdonald functions. As for the q-Bessel functions of Jackson there is a couple of functions of the both kind. They are arisen in the Harmonic analysis on quantum symmetric spaces similarly to their classical counterpart.   Their definition is based on the power expansions. We derive the recurrence relations, difference equations, q-Wronskians, and an analog of asymptotic expansions which turns out is exact in some domain if q\neq 1. Some relations for the basic hypergeometric function which follow from this fact are discussed.
