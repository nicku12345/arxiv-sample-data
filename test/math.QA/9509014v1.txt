A noncommutative algebra of the complex q-twistors and their differentials is considered on the basis of the quantum GL_q (4)\times SL_q (2) group. Real and pseudoreal q-twistors are discussed too. We consider the quantum-group self-duality equation in the framework of the local gauge algebra of differential forms on q-twistor spaces. Quantum deformations of the general multi-instanton solutions are constructed. The corresponding noncommutative algebras of moduli are introduced. The general q-instanton connection is a function of the q-twistors and the q-moduli .
