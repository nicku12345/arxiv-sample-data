We show that certain embeddable homogeneous spaces of a quantum group that do not correspond to a quantum subgroup still have the structure of quantum quotient spaces. We propose a construction of quantum fibre bundles on such spaces. The quantum plane and the general quantum two-spheres are discussed in detail.
