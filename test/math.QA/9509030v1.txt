We proposed the construction of the differential calculus on the quantum group and its subgroup with the property of the natural reduction: the differential calculus on the quantum group GL_q(2,C) has to contain the differential calculus on the quantum subgroup SL_q(2,C) and quantum plane C_q(2|0) (''quantum matrjoshka''). We found, that there are two differential calculi, associated to the left differential Maurer--Cartan 1-forms and to the right differential 1-forms. Matched reduction take the degeneracy between the left and right differentials. The classical limit (q\to 1) of the ''left'' differential calculus and of the ''right'' differential calculus is undeformed differential calculus. The condition {\cal D}_qG=1 gives the differential calculus on SL_q(2,C), which contains the differential calculus on the quantum plane C_q(2|0).
