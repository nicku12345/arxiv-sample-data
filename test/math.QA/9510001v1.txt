In a recent paper (1994 {\sl J.\ Phys.\ A: Math.\ Gen.\ }{\bf 27} 5907), Oh and Singh determined a Hopf structure for a generalized q-oscillator algebra. We prove that under some general assumptions, the latter is, apart from some algebras isomorphic to su_q(2), su_q(1,1), or their undeformed counterparts, the only generalized deformed oscillator algebra that supports a Hopf structure. We show in addition that the latter can be equipped with a universal \cR-matrix, thereby making it into a quasitriangular Hopf algebra.
