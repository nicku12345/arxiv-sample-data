A unified view of general multimode oscillator algebras with Fock-like representations is presented.It extends a previous analysis of the single-mode oscillator algebras.The expansion of the a_ia_j^{\dagger} operators is extended to include all normally ordered terms in creation and annihilation operators and we analyze their action on Fock-like states.We restrict ourselves to the algebras compatible with number operators. The connection between these algebras and generalized statistics is analyzed.We demonstrate our approach by considering the algebras obtainable from the generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation, the para-Bose and para-Fermi algebras, the Govorkov "paraquantization" algebra and generalized quon algebra.
