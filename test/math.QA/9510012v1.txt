Fully braided analog of Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan construction of quasitriangular bialgebra A(X,R) is proposed. For given pairing C factor-algebra A(X,R;C) is a dual quantum braided group. Corresponding inhomogeneous quantum group is obtained as a result of generalized bosonization. Construction of first order bicovariant differential calculus is proposed.
