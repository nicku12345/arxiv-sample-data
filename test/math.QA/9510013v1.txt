Let A be a Hopf algebra in a braided category \cal C. Crossed modules over A are introduced and studied as objects with both module and comodule structures satisfying a compatibility condition. The category \DY{\cal C}^A_A of crossed modules is braided and is a concrete realization of a known general construction of a double or center of a monoidal category. For a quantum braided group (A,\overline A,{\cal R}) the corresponding braided category of modules {\cal C}_{\cO{A,\overline A}} is identified with a full subcategory in \DY{\cal C}_A^A. The connection with cross products is discussed and a suitable cross product in the class of quantum braided groups is built. Majid--Radford theorem, which gives equivalent conditions for an ordinary Hopf algebra to be such a cross product, is generalized to the braided category. Majid's bosonization theorem is also generalized.
