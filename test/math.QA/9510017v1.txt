A three-dimensional q-Lie algebra of SU_q(2) is realized in terms of first- and second-order differential operators. Starting from the q-Lie algebra one has constructed a left-covariant differential calculus on the quantum group. The proposed construction is inverse to the standard Woronowicz approach; the left-invariant vector fields are introduced as initial objects whereas the differential 1-forms are defined in a dual manner.
