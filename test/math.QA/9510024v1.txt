The nonsemisimple quantum Cayley-Klein groups  Fun(SU_{q}(2;\bf j})  are realized as Hopf algebra of the noncommutative functions with the dual (or Study) variables. The {\it dual} quantum algebras  su_q(2;{\bf j})  are constructed and their isomorphisms with the corresponding quantum orthogonal algebras  so_q(3;{\bf j})  are established. The possible couplings of the Cayley-Klein and Hopf structures are considered.
