A variety of three-dimensional left-covariant differential calculi on the quantum group SU_q(2) is considered using an approach based on global  U(1)  -covariance. Explicit representations of possible q -Lie algebras are constructed in terms of differential operators. A gauge covariant differential algebra is uniquely determined. The non-standard Leibnitz rule is obtained for a corresponding q-Lie algebra.
