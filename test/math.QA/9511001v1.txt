We introduce a quasitriangular Hopf algebra or `quantum group' U(B), the {\em double-bosonisation}, associated to every braided group B in the category of H-modules over a quasitriangular Hopf algebra H, such that B appears as the `positive root space', H as the `Cartan subalgebra' and the dual braided group B^* as the `negative root space' of U(B). The choice B=f recovers Lusztig's construction of U_q(g), where f is Lusztig's algebra associated to a Cartan datum; other choices give more novel quantum groups. As an application, our construction provides a canonical way of building up quantum groups from smaller ones by repeatedly extending their positive and negative root spaces by linear braided groups; we explicitly construct U_q(sl_3) from U_q(sl_2) by this method, extending it by the quantum-braided plane A_q^2. We provide a fundamental representation of U(B) in B. A projection from the quantum double, a theory of double biproducts and a Tannaka-Krein reconstruction point of view are also provided.
