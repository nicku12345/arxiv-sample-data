The Gauss decomposition of quantum groups and supergroups are considered. The main attention is paid to the R-matrix formulation of the Gauss decomposition and its properties as well as its relation to the contraction procedure. Duality aspects of the Gauss decomposition are also touched. For clarity of exposition a few simple examples are considered in some details.
