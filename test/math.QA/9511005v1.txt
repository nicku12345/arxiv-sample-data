A quantization of a non-standard rational solution of CYBE for sl_2 is given explicitly. We obtain the quantization with the help of a twisting of the usual Yangian Y(sl_2. This quantum object (deformed Yangian Y_{\eta,\xi}(sl_2)) is a two-parametric deformation of the universal enveloping algebra U(sl_2[u]) of the positive current algebra sl_2[u]. We consider the pseudotriangular structure on Y_{\eta,\xi}(sl_2), the quantum double DY_{\eta,\xi}(sl_2) its the universal R-matrix and also the RTT-realization of Y_{\eta,\xi}(sl_2).
