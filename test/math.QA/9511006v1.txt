We consider the modified (or twisted) Yang-Baxter equations for the SL_{q}(N) groups and SL_{q}(N|M) supergroups. The general solutions for these equations are presented in the case of the linear quantum (super)groups. The introduction of spectral parameters in the twisted Yang-Baxter equation and its solutions are also discussed.
