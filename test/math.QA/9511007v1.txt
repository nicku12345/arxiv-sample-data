In the present paper the algebras of functions on quantum homogeneous spaces are studied. The author introduces the algebras of kernels of intertwining integral operators and constructs quantum analogues of the Poisson and Radon transforms for some quantum homogeneous spaces. Some applications and the relation to q-special functions are discussed.
