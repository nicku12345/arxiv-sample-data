Integral of a certain multivalued form over cycle \pmb\Delta provides zonal spherical function of type A_n. This paper is devoted to quantum group analysis and verification of monodromy properties of the distinguished cycle \pmb\Delta. Zonal spherical function is a particular conformal block of WA_n-algebra.
