Isotopic pairs and their representations are considered in a general framework of the vector superalgebra. Numerous examples of finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional isotopic pairs are discussed. Several types of their representations are analysed. Applications to physics and relations to other mathematical objects are specified. Some curious combinatorial aspects of representation theory of isotopic pairs (graph-representations) are explicated. Perspectives of the further researches are drawn.
