We consider the universal solution of the Gervais-Neveu-Felder equation in the {\cal U}_q(sl_2) case. We show that it has a quasi-Hopf algebra interpretation. We also recall its relation to quantum 3-j and 6-j symbols. Finally, we use this solution to build a q-deformation of the trigonometric Lam\'e equation.
