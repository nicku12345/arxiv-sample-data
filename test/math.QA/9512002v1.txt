We construct an invariant of 3-manifolds using a modification of the Kontsevich integral and Kirby's calculus. This invariant, as expected in perturbative Chern-Simon theory, takes values in the algebra of oriented 3-valent graphs. This algebra is a Hopf algebra, graded by half the number of vertices in 3-valent graphs. The degree 1 term of the invariant coincides with Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant. The degree n term is constructed out of the universal Vassiliev invariant of links of degree less than or equal to (l+1)n where l is the number of link components.
