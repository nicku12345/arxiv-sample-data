In this paper we construct a discrete linear operator K which transforms A_2 Macdonald polynomials into the product of two basic 3\phi_2 hypergeometric series with known arguments. The action of the operator K on power sums in two variables can be reduced to a generalization of one particular case of the Bailey's summation formula for a very-well-poised 6\psi_6 series. We also propose the conjecture for a transformation of 6\psi_6 series with different arguments.
