We write the fermionic q-Fock space representation of U_q(\hat{sl_n}) as an infinite extended braided tensor product of finite-dimensional fermionic U_q(sl_n)-quantum planes or exterior algebras. Using braided geometrical techniques developed for such quantum exterior algebras, we provide a new approach to the Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern action of the Heisenberg algebra on the q-fermionic Fock space, obtaining the action in detail for the lowest nontrivial case [b_{2},b_{-2}]=2({1-q^{-4n}\over 1-q^{-4}}). Our R-matrix approach includes other Hecke R-matrices as well.
