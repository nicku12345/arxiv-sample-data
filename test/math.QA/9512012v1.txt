We investigate an infinite dimensional analog of the theory of Lagrangian manifolds with complex germs. To such a manifold we assign a canonical operator that depends on creation and annihilation operators. This operator is by definition the geometrical quantization for these isotropic manifolds with complex germs. We prove that for secondary quantized equations this quantization is the asymptotics for the Cauchy problem. Results of Berezin are used thouroughly in the construction of the canonical operator and in proofs of the theorems.
