The coadjoint orbits for the series B_l,\ C_l and D_l are considered in the case when the base point is a multiple of a fundamental weight. A quantization of the big cell is suggested by means of introducing a \ast-algebra generated by holomorphic coordinate functions. Starting from this algebraic structure the irreducible representations of the deformed universal enveloping algebra are derived as acting in the vector space of polynomials in quantum coordinate functions.
