The meaning of quantum group transformation properties is discussed in some detail by comparing the (co)actions of the quantum group with those of the corresponding Lie group, both of which have the same algebraic (matrix) form of the transformation. Various algebras are considered which are covariant with respect to the quantum (super) groups SU_q(2),\; SU_q(1, 1),\; SU_q(1|1),\; SU_q(n), \\ SU_q(m|n),\; OSp_q(1|2) as well as deformed Minkowski space-time algebras.
