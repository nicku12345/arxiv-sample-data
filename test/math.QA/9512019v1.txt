Based on a closed formula for a star product of Wick type on \CP^n, which has been discovered in an earlier article of the authors, we explicitly construct a subalgebra of the formal star-algebra (with coefficients contained in the uniformly dense subspace of representative functions with respect to the canonical action of the unitary group) that consists of {\em converging} power series in the formal parameter, thereby giving an elementary algebraic proof of a convergence result already obtained by Cahen, Gutt, and Rawnsley. In this subalgebra the formal parameter can be substituted by a real number \alpha: the resulting associative algebras are infinite-dimensional except for the case \alpha=1/K, K a positive integer, where they turn out to be isomorphic to the finite-dimensional algebra of linear operators in the Kth energy eigenspace of an isotropic harmonic oscillator with n+1 degrees of freedom. Other examples like the 2n-torus and the Poincar\'e disk are discussed.
