We introduce a universal R matrix for the Jordanian deformation of \U{ \sl(2)}. Using \Uh{\so(4)}=\Uh{\sl(2)} \oplus {\rm U}_{-h}(\sl(2)), we obtain the universal R matrix for \Uh{\so(4)}. Applying the graded contractions on the universal R matrix of \Uh{\so(4)}, we show that there exist three distinct R matrices for all of the contracted algebras. It is shown that \Uh{\sl(2)}, \Uh{\so(4)}, and all of these contracted algebras are triangular.
