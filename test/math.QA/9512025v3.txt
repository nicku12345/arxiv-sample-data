In this paper we continue with the program to explore the topography of the space of W-type algebras. In the present case, the starting point is the work of Khesin, Lyubashenko and Roger on the algebra of q-deformed pseudodifferential symbols and their associated integrable hierarchies. The analysis goes on by studying the associated hamiltonian structures for which compact expressions are found. The fundamental Poisson brackets yield q-deformations of W_{KP} and related W-type algebras which, in specific cases, coincide with the ones constructed by Frenkel and Reshetikhin. The construction underlies a continuous correspondence between the hamiltonian structures of the Toda lattice and the KP hierarchies.
