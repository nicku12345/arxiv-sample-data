Given a finite type root datum and a primitive root of unity q=\sqrt[l]{1}, G.~Lusztig has defined in [Lu] a remarkable finite dimensional Hopf algebra \fu over the cyclotomic field {\Bbb Q}(\sqrt[l]{1}). In this note we study the adjoint representation \ad of \fu in the simplest case of the root datum sl_2. The semisimple part of this representation is of big importance in the study of local systems of conformal blocks in WZW model for \hat{sl}_2 at level l-2 in arbitrary genus. The problem of distinguishing the semisimple part is closely related to the problem of integral representation of conformal blocks (see [BFS]). We find all the indecomposable direct summands of \ad with multiplicities. It appears that \ad is isomorphic to a direct sum of simple and projective modules. It can be lifted to a module over the (infinite dimensional) quantum universal enveloping algebra with divided powers U_q(sl_2) which is also a direct sum of simples and projectives.
