We collect here some less well-known results and formulae about the bosonisation construction which turns braided groups into quantum groups. We clarify the relation with biproduct Hopf algebras (the constructions are not the same), the response to twisting of braided groups and the abstract characterisation via automorphisms of the forgetful functor for the category of (co)modules of a braided group.
