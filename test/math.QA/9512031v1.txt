We introduce a new family of symmetric functions, which are q-analogues of products of Schur functions defined in terms of ribbon tableaux. These functions can be interpreted in terms of the Fock space representation of the quantum affine algebra of type A_{n-1}^{(1)} and are related to Hall-Littlewood functions via the geometry of flag varieties. We present a series of conjectures, and prove them in special cases. The essential step in proving that these functions are actually symmetric consists in the calculation of a basis of highest weight vectors of the q-Fock space using ribbon tableaux.
