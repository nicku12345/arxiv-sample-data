In [LMO] a 3-manifold invariant \Omega(M) is constructed using a modification of the Kontsevich integral and the Kirby calculus. The invariant \Omega takes values in a graded Hopf algebra of Feynman 3-valent graphs. Here we show that for homology 3-spheres the invariant \Omega is {\em universal} for all finite type invariants, i.e. \Omega_n is an invariant of order 3n which dominates all other invariants of the same order. This shows that the set of finite type invariants of homology 3-spheres is equivalent to the Hopf algebra of Feynman 3-valent graphs. Some corollaries are discussed. A theory of groups of homology 3-spheres, similar to Gusarov's theory for knots, is presented.
