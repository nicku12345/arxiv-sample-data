The polynomial deformations of the Witten extensions of the U(su(2)) and U(osp(1,2)) algebras are three generator algebras with normal ordering, admitting a two generator subalgebra. The modules and the representations of these algebras are based on the construction of Verma modules, which are quotient modules, generated by ideals of the original algebra. This construction unifies a large number of the known algebras under the same scheme. The finite dimensional representations show new features such as the multiplicity of representations of the same dimensionality, or the existence of finite dimensional representations only for some dimensions.
