Central bialgebras in a braided category \C are algebras in the center of the category of coalgebras in \C. On these bialgebras another product can be defined, which plays the role of the opposite product. Hence, coquasitriangular structures on central bialgebras can be defined. We prove some properties of the antipode on coquasitriangular central Hopf algebras and give a characterization of central bialgebras.
