We show that a variation of Milnor's \bar\mu-invariants, the so-called Campbell-Hausdorff invariants introduced recently by Stefan Papadima, are of finite type with respect to {\it marked singular links}. These link invariants are stronger than quantum invariants in the sense that they detect easily the non-invertibility of links with more than one components. It is still open whether some effectively computable knot invariants, e.g. finite type knot invariants (Vassiliev invariants), could detect the non-invertibility of knots.
