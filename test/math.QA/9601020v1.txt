We study N^2-1 dimensional left-covariant differential calculi on the quantum group SL_q(N) for which the generators of the quantum Lie algebras annihilate the quantum trace. In this way we obtain one distinguished calculus on SL_q(2) (which corresponds to Woronowicz' 3D-calculus on SU_q(2)) and two distinguished calculi on SL_q(3) such that the higher order calculi give the ordinary differential calculus on SL(2) and SL(3), respectively, in the limit q\rightarrow 1. Two new differential calculi on SL_q(3) are introduced and developed in detail.
