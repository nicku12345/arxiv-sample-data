We show that the action of the special conformal transformations of the usual (undeformed) conformal group is the q\to 1 scaling limit of the braided adjoint action or R-commutator of q-Minkowski space on itself. We also describe the q-deformed conformal algebra in R-matrix form and its quasi-* structure.
