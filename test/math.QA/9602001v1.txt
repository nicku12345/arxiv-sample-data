An introduction to inhomogeneous Poisson groups is given. Poisson inhomogeneous O(p,q) are shown to be coboundary, the generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation having only one-dimensional right hand side. Normal forms of the classical r-matrices for the Poincar\'{e} group (inhomogeneous O(1,3)) are calculated.
