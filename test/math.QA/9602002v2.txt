We show that a Poisson Lie group (G,\pi) is coboundary if and only if the natural action of G\times G on M=G is a Poisson action for an appropriate Poisson structure on M (the structure turns out to be the well known \pi _+). We analyze the same condition in the context of Hopf algebras. Quantum analogue of the \pi_+ structure on SU(N) is described in terms of generators and relations as an example.
