We define B\"acklund--Darboux transformations in Sato's Grassmannian. They can be regarded as Darboux transformations on maximal algebras of commuting ordinary differential operators. We describe the action of these transformations on related objects: wave functions, tau-functions and spectral algebras.   This paper is the second of a series of papers (hep-th/9510211, q-alg/9602011, q-alg/9602012) on the bispectral problem.
