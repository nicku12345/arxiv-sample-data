The dually conjugate Hopf algebras Fun_{p,q}(R) and U_{p,q}(R) associated with the two-parametric (p,q)-Alexander-Conway solution (R) of the Yang-Baxter equation are studied. Using the Hopf duality construction, the full Hopf structure of the quasitriangular enveloping algebra U_{p,q}(R) is extracted. The universal {\cal T}-matrix for Fun_{p,q}(R) is derived. While expressing an arbitrary group element of the quantum group characterized by the noncommuting parameters in a representation independent way, the {\cal T}-matrix generalizes the familiar exponential relation between a Lie group and its Lie algebra. The universal {\cal R}-matrix and the FRT matrix generators, L^{(\pm )}, for U_{p,q}(R) are derived from the {\cal T}-matrix.
