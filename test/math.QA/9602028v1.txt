We consider remarkable central elements of the universal enveloping algebra of the general linear algebra which we call quantum immanants. We express them in terms of generators E_{ij} and as differential operators on the space of matrices. These expressions are a direct generalization of the classical Capelli identities. They result in many nontrivial properties of quantum immanants.
