The \hat\kappa-deformed extended Galilei Hopf group algebra, {\rm Fun}_{\hat\kappa}(\tilde G_{(m)}), is introduced. It provides an example of a cocycle bicrossproduct structure, and is shown to be the contraction limit of a pseudoextension of the \kappa-Poincar\'e group algebra. The possibility of obtaining another deformed extended Galilei groups is discussed, including one obtained from a non-standard Poincar\'e deformation.
