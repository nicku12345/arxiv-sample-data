The paper contains the construction of a topological quantum field theory with corners that underlies the smooth topological quantum field theory of Lickorish. Among other things, a contraction formula for diagrams is proved, the presence of the skein relation at the level of manifolds with boundary is shown and an explanation for the surgery formula for invariants of closed manifolds is given.
