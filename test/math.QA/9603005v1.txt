A weight function which q-generalizes the ground state wave function of the multi-component Calogero-Sutherland quantum many body system is introduced. Conjectures, and some proofs in special cases, are given for a constant term identity involving this function. A Gram-Schmidt procedure with respect to the inner product associated with the weight function is used to define orthogonal polynomials in one of the components, which are conjectured to be the Macdonald polynomials P_\kappa(w_1,\dots,w_{N_0};qt^p,t), and a proof is given in a special case. Conjectures are also given for an adjoint property of the Macdonald operator with respect to the inner product associated with the weight function, and the normalization of the Macdonald polynomial with respect to the same inner product.
