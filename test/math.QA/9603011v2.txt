Previous work has shown that certain leading orders of arbitrary Vassiliev invariants are generically in the algebra of the coefficients of the Alexander-Conway polynomial \cite{KSA}. Here we illustrate this for a large class of examples, exposing the simple logic behind several existing results in the literature \cite{FKV,BNG}. This approach facilitates an extension to a large class of Lie (super)algebras.
