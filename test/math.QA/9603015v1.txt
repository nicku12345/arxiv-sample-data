In this paper, we give defining relations of the affine Lie superalgebras an and defining relations of a super-version of the Drinfeld[D]-Jimbo[J] affine quantized universal enveloping algebras. As a result, we can exactly define the affine quantized universal enveloping superalgebras with generators and relations. Moreover we give a Drinfeld's realizations of U_h({\hat {sl}}(m|n)^{(1)}).
