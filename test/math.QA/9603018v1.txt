We develop a gauge theory or theory of bundles and connections on them at the level of braids and tangles. Extending recent algebraic work, we provide now a fully diagrammatic treatment of principal bundles, a theory of global gauge transformations, associated braided fiber bundles and covariant derivatives on them. We describe the local structure for a concrete Z_3-graded or `anyonic' realization of the theory.
