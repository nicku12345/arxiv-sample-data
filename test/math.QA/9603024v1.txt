We study the "Lie Algebra" of the group of Gauge Transformations of Space-time. We obtain topological invariants arising from this Lie Algebra. Our methods give us fresh mathematical points of view on Lorentz Transformations, orientation conventions, the Doppler shift, Pauli matrices , Electro-Magnetic Duality Rotation, Poynting vectors, and the Energy Momentum Tensor T .
