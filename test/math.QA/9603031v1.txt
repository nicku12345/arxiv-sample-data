We clarify some aspects of quantum group gauge theory and its recent generalisations (by T. Brzezinski and the author) to braided group gauge theory and coalgebra gauge theory. We outline the diagrammatic version of the braided case. We study the bosonisation of any braided group provides as a trivial principal bundle in three ways.
