On the basis of `RTT=TTR' formalism, we introduce the quantum double of the Yangian Y_{\hbar}(\gtg) for \gtg=\gtgl_N,\gtsl_N with a central extension. The Gauss decomposition of T-matrices gives us the so-called Drinfel'd generators. Using these generators, we present some examples of both finite and infinite dimensional representations that are quite natural deformations of the corresponding affine counterpart.
