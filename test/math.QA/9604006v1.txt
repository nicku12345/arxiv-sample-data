The paper contains the construction of a topological quantum field theory in which gluings along surfaces with boundary are allowed. The construction is made by using quantum deformations of sl(2,C). In the construction there appears a sign obstruction to some of the Moore-Seiberg equations. This problem is solved by means of the Klein four group.
