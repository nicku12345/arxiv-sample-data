Let  G^\tau  be a connected simply connected semisimple algebraic group, endowed with generalized Sklyanin-Drinfeld structure of Poisson group; let  H^\tau  be its dual Poisson group. By means of Drinfeld's double construction and dualization via formal Hopf algebras, we construct new quantum groups  U_{q,\phi}^M ({\frak h})  --- dual of  U_{q,\phi}^{M'} ({\frak g})  --- which yield infinitesimal quantization of  H^\tau  and  G^\tau ; we study their specializations at roots of 1 (in particular, their classical limits), thus discovering new quantum Frobenius morphisms. The whole description dualize for  H^\tau  what was known for  G^\tau , completing the quantization of the pair  (G^\tau,H^\tau) .
