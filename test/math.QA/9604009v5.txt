The present work splits in two parts: first, we perform a straightforward generalization of results from [Re], proving autoquasitriangularity of quantum groups  U_q(\frak{g})  and their unrestricted specializations at roots of 1, in particular the function algebra  F[H]  of the Poisson group  H  dual of  G ; second, as a main contribution, we prove the convergence of the (specialized)  R --matrix action to a birational automorphism of a 2\ell--fold ramified covering of the specialization of  U_q(\frak{g})  at a primitive  \ell --th root of 1, and of a 2-fold ramified covering of  H , thus giving a geometric content to the notion of triangularity (or autoquasitriangularity) for quantum groups.
