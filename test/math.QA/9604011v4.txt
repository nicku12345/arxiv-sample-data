The rational quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation (qKZ equation) associated with the Lie algebra sl_2 is a system of linear difference equations with values in a tensor product of sl_2 Verma modules. We solve the equation in terms of multidimensional q-hypergeometric functions and define a natural isomorphism between the space of solutions and the tensor product of the corresponding quantum group U_q(sl_2) Verma modules, where the parameter q is related to the step p of the qKZ equation via q=e^{pi i/p}.   We construct asymptotic solutions associated with suitable asymptotic zones and compute the transition functions between the asymptotic solutions in terms of the trigonometric R-matrices. This description of the transition functions gives a new connection between representation theories of Yangians and quantum loop algebras and is analogous to the Kohno-Drinfeld theorem on the monodromy group of the differential Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation.   In order to establish these results we construct a discrete Gauss-Manin connection, in particular, a suitable discrete local system, discrete homology and cohomology groups with coefficients in this local system, and identify an associated difference equation with the qKZ equation.
