A higher spin generalization of the XYZ spin chain defined by the fusion procedure is considered. Energy and momentum of the ground state and low-lying excited states of the model are computed by means of an isomorphism between a space of theta functions on which the Sklyanin algebra acts and a space obtained by the fusion procedure.
