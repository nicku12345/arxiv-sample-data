Let M be a compact orientable 3-manifold. The set of characters of SL_2({\mathbb C}) representations of the fundamental group of M forms a closed affine algebraic set. We show that its coordinate ring is isomorphic to a specialization of the Kauffman bracket skein module modulo its nilradical. This is accomplished by making the module into a combinatorial analog of the ring, in which tools of skein theory are exploited to illuminate relations among characters. We conclude with an application, proving that a small manifold's specialized module is necessarily finite dimensional.
