It is well known that the bosonized version of the Wakimoto construction allows the explicit realization of any affine algebra \widehat{g}, with arbitrary level k in the homogeneous gradation, in terms of dim(g) free bosonic fields. In this paper, we show in the case of the simplest affine algebra \widehat{sl(2)}, that the bosonized Wakimoto realization can be extended to the principal gradation only when k is equal to the critical level, i.e., -2. In this case, this construction can be achieved in terms of arbitrary number (larger than 1) of free bosonic fields.
