It is proved that quasi-exactly soluble potentials corresponding to an oscillator with harmonic, quartic and sextic terms, for which the n+1 lowest levels of a given parity can be determined exactly, may be approximated by WKB equivalent potentials corresponding to deformed anharmonic oscillators of SU_q(1,1) symmetry, which have been used for the description of vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules. This connection allows for the immediate approximate determination of the levels of the same parity lying above the lowest n+1 known levels, as well as of all levels of the opposite parity. Such connections are not possible in the cases of the q-deformed oscillator, the Q-deformed oscillator, and the modified P\"oschl-Teller potential with SU(1,1) symmetry.
