We study the asymptotic expansion of the colored Jones polynomial (the Melvin-Morton expansion) using a recursion formula for the deframed universal weight system for the sl(2) Lie algebra. Combined with the formula for the universal weight system for the Lie superalgebra gl(1|1) (which corresponds to the Alexander-Conway knot polynomial) this formula gives a very short proof of the Melvin-Morton conjecture relating the colored Jones invariant and the Alexander-Conway polynomial of knots.
