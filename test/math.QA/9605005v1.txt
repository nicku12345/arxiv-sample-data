We study certain q-difference raising operators for Macdonald polynomials (of type A_{n-1}) which are originated from the q-difference-reflection operators introduced in our previous paper. These operators can be regarded as a q-difference version of the raising operators for Jack polynomials introduced by L.Lapointe and L.Vinet. As an application of our q-difference raising operators we give an elementary proof of the integrality of the double Kostka coefficients which had been conjectured I.G. Macdonald. We also determine their quasi-classical limits, which give rise to (differental) raising operators for Jack polynomials.
