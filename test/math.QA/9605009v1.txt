A construction of the noncommutative-geometric counterparts of classical classifying spaces is presented, for general compact matrix quantum structure groups. A quantum analogue of the classical concept of the classifying map is introduced and analyzed. Interrelations with the abstract algebraic theory of quantum characteristic classes are discussed. Various non-equivalent approaches to defining universal characteristic classes are outlined.
