It is shown that every quantum principal bundle is braided, in the sense that there exists an intrinsic braid operator twisting the functions on the bundle. A detailed algebraic analysis of this operator is performed. In particular, it turns out that the braiding admits a natural extension to the level of arbitrary differential forms on the bundle. Applications of the formalism to the study of quantum gauge transformations are presented.
