In this letter we compute some elementary properties of the Fedosov star product of Weyl type, such as symmetry and order of differentiation. Moreover, we define the notion of a star product of Wick type on every K\"ahler manifold by a straight forward generalization of the corresponding star product in \mathbb C^n: the corresponding sequence of bidifferential operators differentiates its first argument in holomorphic directions and its second argument in antiholomorphic directions. By a Fedosov type procedure we give an existence proof of such star products for any K\"ahler manifold.
