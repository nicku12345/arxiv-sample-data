We extend some results about shifted Schur functions to the general context of shifted Macdonald polynomials. We obtain two explicit formulas for these polynomials: a q-integral representation and a combinatorial formula. Our main tool is a q-integral representation for ordinary Macdonald polynomials. We also discuss duality for shifted Macdonald polynomials and Jack degeneration of these polynomials.
