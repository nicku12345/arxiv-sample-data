Let A be an arbitrary symmetrizable Cartan matrix of rank r, and {\bf n}={\bf n_+} be the standard maximal nilpotent subalgebra in the Kac-Moody algebra associated with A (thus, {\bf n} is generated by E_1,\ldots,E_r subject to the Serre relations). Let \hat U_q({\bf n}) be the completion (with respect to the natural grading) of the quantized enveloping algebra of {\bf n}. For a sequence {\bf i}=(i_1,\ldots,i_m) with 1\le i_k\le r, let P_{\bf i} be a skew polynomial algebra generated by t_1,\ldots,t_m subject to the relations t_lt_k=q^{C_{i_k,i_l}}t_kt_l (1\le k<l\le m) where C=(C_{ij})=(d_ia_{ij}) is the symmetric matrix corresponding to A. We construct a group-like element {\bf e}_{\bf i}\in P_{\bf i}\bigotimes \hat U_q({\bf n}). This element gives rise to the evaluation homomorphism \psi_{\bf i}:{\bf C}_q[N]\to P_{\bf i} given by \psi_{\bf i}(x)=x({\bf e}_{\bf i}), where {\bf C}_q[N]=U_q({\bf n})^0 is the restricted dual of U_q({\bf n}). Under a well-known isomorphism of algebras {\bf C}_q[N] and U_q({\bf n}), the map \psi_{\bf i} identifies with Feigin's homomorphism \Phi({\bf i}): U_q({\bf n})\to P_{\bf i}. We prove that the image of \psi_{\bf i} generates the skew-field of fractions {\cal F}(P_{\bf i}) if and only if {\bf i} is a reduced expression of some element w in the Weyl group W; furthermore, in the latter case, {\rm Ker}~\psi_{\bf i} depends only on w (so we denote I_w:={\rm Ker}~\psi_{\bf i}). This result generalizes the results in [5], [6] to the case of Kac-Moody algebras. We also construct an element {\cal R}_w\in \big({\bf C}_q[N]/I_w\big)\bigotimes \hat U_q({\bf n}) which specializes to {\bf e}_{\bf i} under the embedding {\bf C}_q[N]/I_w\hookrightarrow P_{\bf i}. The elements {\cal R}_w are closely
