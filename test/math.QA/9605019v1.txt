It was shown by Goussarov that Vassiliev invariants are polynomials in the gleams for a fixed Turaev shadow. In this paper we show that Vassiliev invariants are almost characterized by this fact. We also prove that the space of knot invariants which are polynomials in the gleams is bigger than the Vassiliev subspace.
