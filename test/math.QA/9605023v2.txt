Using a probabilistic interpretation of the Burau representation of the braid group offered by Vaughan Jones, we generalize the Burau representation to a representation of the semigroup of string links. This representation is determined by a linear system, and is dominated by finite type string link invariants. For positive string links, the representation matrix can be interpreted as the transition matrix of a Markov process. For positive non-separable links, we show that all states are persistent. (This is an extensively revised version of the first author's original paper titled "Burau representation and random walk on knots".)
