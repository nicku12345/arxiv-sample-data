Quantum Lie algebras are generalizations of Lie algebras whose structure constants are power series in h. They are derived from the quantized enveloping algebras \uqg. The quantum Lie bracket satisfies a generalization of antisymmetry. Representations of quantum Lie algebras are defined in terms of a generalized commutator.   In this paper the recent general results about quantum Lie algebras are introduced with the help of the explicit example of (sl_2)_h.
