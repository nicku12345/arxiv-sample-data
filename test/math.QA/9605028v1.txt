We give a very short proof of the Melvin-Morton conjecture relating the colored Jones polynomial and the Alexander polynomial of knots. The proof is based on the explicit evaluation of the corresponding weight systems on primitive elements of the Hopf algebra of chord diagrams which, in turn, follows from simple identities between four-valent tensors on the Lie algebra sl_2 and the Lie superalgebra gl(1|1). This shows that the miraculous connection between the Jones and Alexander invariants follows from the similarity (supersymmetry) between sl_2 and gl(1|1).
