The non-standard (Jordanian) quantum deformations of so(2,2) and (2+1) Poincar\'e algebras are constructed by starting from a quantum sl(2,\R) basis such that simple factorized expressions for their corresponding universal R-matrices are obtained. As an application, the null-plane quantum (2+1) Poincar\'e Poisson-Lie group is quantized by following the FRT prescription. Matrix and differential representations of this null-plane deformation are presented, and the influence of the choice of the basis in the resultant q-Schr\"odinger equation governing the deformed null plane evolution is commented.
