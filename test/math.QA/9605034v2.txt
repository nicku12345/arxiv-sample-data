We study some properties of the Askey-Wilson polynomials (AWP) when q is a primitive N-th root of unity. For general four-parameter AWP, zeros of the N-th polynomial and the orthogonality measure are found explicitly. Special subclasses of the AWP, e.g., the continuous q-Jacobi and big q-Jacobi polynomials, are considered in detail. A set of discrete weight functions positive on a real interval is described. Some new trigonometric identities related to the AWP are obtained. Normalization conditions of some polynomials are expressed in terms of the Gauss sums.
