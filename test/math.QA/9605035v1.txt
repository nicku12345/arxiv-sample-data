Given an abelian k-linear rigid monoidal category V, where k is a perfect field, we define squared coalgebras as objects of cocompleted V tensor V (Deligne's tensor product of categories) equipped with the appropriate notion of comultiplication. Based on this, (squared) bialgebras and Hopf algebras are defined without use of braiding.   If V is the category of k-vector spaces, squared (co)algebras coincide with conventional ones. If V is braided, a braided Hopf algebra can be obtained from a squared one.   Reconstruction theorems give equivalence of squared co- (bi-, Hopf) algebras in V and corresponding fibre functors to V (which is not the case with other definitions). Finally, squared quasitriangular Hopf coalgebra is a solution to the problem of defining quantum groups in braided categories.
