A. Casson defined an intersection number invariant which can be roughly thought of as the number of conjugacy classes of irreducible representations of \pi_1(Y) into SU(2) counted with signs, where Y is an oriented integral homology 3-sphere. X.S. Lin defined an similar invariant (signature of a knot) to a braid representative of a knot in S^3. In this paper, we give a natural generalization of the Casson-Lin's invariant to be (instead of using the instanton Floer homology) the symplectic Floer homology for the representation space (one singular point) of \pi_1(S^3 \setminus K) into SU(2) with trace-free along all meridians. The symplectic Floer homology of braids is a new invariant of knots and its Euler number of such a symplectic Floer homology is the negative of the Casson-Lin's invariant.
