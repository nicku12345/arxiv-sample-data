A level-one representation of the quantum affine superalgebra \U_q(\hat{\frak{sl}}(M+1|N+1)) and vertex operators associated with the fundamental representations are constructed in terms of free bosonic fields. Character formulas of level-one irreducible highest weight modules of \U_q(\hat{\frak{sl}}(2|1)) are conjectured.
