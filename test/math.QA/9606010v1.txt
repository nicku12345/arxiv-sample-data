The exact form factors of the Heisenberg models XXX and XXZ have been recently computed through the quantum affine symmetry of XXZ model in the thermodynamic limit. We use them to derive an exact formula for the contribution of two spinons to the dynamical correlation function of XXX model at zero temperature.
