The generators of the Jordanian quantum algebra {\cal U}_h(sl(2)) are expressed as nonlinear invertible functions of the classical sl(2) generators. This permits immediate explicit construction of the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra {\cal U}_h(sl(2)). Using this construction, new finite dimensional solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation may be obtained.
