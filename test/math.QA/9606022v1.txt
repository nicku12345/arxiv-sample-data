The bicovariant differential calculus on fourdimensional kappa-Poincare group and corresponding Lie-algebra like structure for any metric tensor are described. The bicovariant differential calculus on four-dimensional kappa-Weyl group and corresponding Lie-algebra like structure for any matric tensor in the reference frame in which g_{00}=0 are considered.
