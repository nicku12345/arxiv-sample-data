A new set of polynomial states (to be called character states) are derived for Sp(4) reduced to its SU(2) \times U(1) subgroup, and the relevant generator matrix elements are evaluated for generic representations (a,b) of Sp(4). (The degenerate representations (a,0) and (0,b) were treated in our previous work and are also given in this paper). The group--subgroup in question is that of the seniority model of nuclear physics.
