This paper has been withdrawn because of a gap in the proof of Lemma 3.10. The main reults in this paper have now been proved, and extended in the following papers:   S. Ariki and A. Mathas, The number of simple modules of the Hecke algebras of type G(r,1,n)   S. Ariki, On the classification of simple modules for cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type G(m,1,n) and Kleshchev multipartitions
