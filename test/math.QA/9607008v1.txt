In this paper we describe a multiparameter deformation of the function algebra of a semisimple coadjoint orbit. In the first section we use the representation of the Lie algebra on a generalized Verma module to quantize the Kirillov bracket on the family of semisimple coadjoint orbits of a given orbit type. In the second section we extend this construction to define a deformation in the category of representations of the quantized enveloping algebra. In an earlier paper we used cohomological methods to prove the existence of a two parameter family quantizing a compatible pair of Poisson brackets on any symmetric coadjoint orbit. This paper gives a more explicit algebraic construction which includes more general orbit types and which we prove to be flat in all parameters.
