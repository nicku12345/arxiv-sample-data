A non-linear map is applied onto the (non-standard) null-plane deformation of (3+1) Poincar\'e algebra giving rise to a simpler form of this triangular quantization. A universal R-matrix for the null plane quantum algebra is then obtained from a universal T-matrix corresponding to a Hopf subalgebra. Finally, the associated Poincar\'e Poisson--Lie group is quantized by using the FRT approach.
