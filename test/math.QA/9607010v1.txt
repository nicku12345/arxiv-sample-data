The interpretation of the Meixner-Pollaczek, Meixner and Laguerre polynomials as overlap coefficients in the positive discrete series representations of the Lie algebra su(1,1) and the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition leads to generalisations of the convolution identities for these polynomials. Using the Racah coefficients convolution identities for continuous Hahn, Hahn and Jacobi polynomials are obtained. From the quantised universal enveloping algebra for su(1,1) convolution identities for the Al-Salam and Chihara polynomials and the Askey-Wilson polynomials are derived by using the Clebsch-Gordan and Racah coefficients. For the quantised universal enveloping algebra for su(2) q-Racah polynomials are interpreted as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and the linearisation coefficients for a two-parameter family of Askey-Wilson polynomials are derived.
