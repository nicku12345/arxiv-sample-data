Two differential calculi are developped on an algebra generalizing the usual q-oscillator algebra and involving three generators and three parameters. They are shown to be invariant under the same quantum group that is extended to a ten-generator Hopf algebra. We discuss the special case where it reduces to a deformation of the invariance group of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra for which we prove the existence of a constraint between the values of the parameters.
