We investigate certain bases of Hecke algebras defined by means of the Yang-Baxter equation, which we call Yang-Baxter bases. These bases are essentially self-adjoint with respect to a canonical bilinear form. In the case of the degenerate Hecke algebra, we identify the coefficients in the expansion of the Yang-Baxter basis on the usual basis of the algebra with specializations of double Schubert polynomials. We also describe the expansions associated to other specializations of the generic Hecke algebra.
