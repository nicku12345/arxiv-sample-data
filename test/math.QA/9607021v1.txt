Quantization, at least in some formulations, involves replacing some algebra of observables by a (more non-commutative) deformed algebra. In view of the fundamental role played by K-theory in non-commutative geometry and topology, it is of interest to ask to what extent K-theory remains "rigid" under this process. We show that some positive results can be obtained using ideas of Gabber, Gillet-Thomason, and Suslin. From this we derive that the algebraic K-theory with finite coefficients of a deformation quantization of the functions on a compact symplectic manifold, forgetting the topology, recovers the topological K-theory of the manifold.
