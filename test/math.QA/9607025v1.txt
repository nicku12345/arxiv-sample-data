We present formulas of Rodrigues type giving the Macdonald polynomials for arbitrary partitions through the repeated application of creation operators on the constant 1. Three expressions for the creation operators are derived one from the other. When the last of these expressions is used, the associated Rodrigues formula readily implies the integrality of the (q,t)-Kostka coefficients. The proofs given in this paper rely on the connection between affine Hecke algebras and Macdonald polynomials
