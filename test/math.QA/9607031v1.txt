On the level-1 Fock space modules of the algebra U_q(\hat{sl_n}) we define a level-0 action U_0 of the U_q(\hat{sl_n}), and an action of an abelian algebra of conserved Hamiltonians commuting with the U_0. An irreducible decomposition of the Fock space with respect to the level-0 action is derived by constructing a base of the Fock space in terms of the Non-symmetric Macdonald Polynomials.
