Drinfeld gave a current realization of the quantum affine algebras as a Hopf algebra with a simple comultiplication for the quantum current operators. In this paper, we will present a generalization of such a realization of quantum Hopf algebras. As a special case, we will choose the structure functions for this algebra to be elliptic functions to derive certain elliptic quantum groups as a Hopf algebra, which degenerates into quantum affine algebras if we take certain degeneration of the structure functions.
