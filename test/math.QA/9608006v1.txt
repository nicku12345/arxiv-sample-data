We study various aspects of Fedosov star-products on symplectic manifolds. By introducing the notion of "quantum exponential maps", we give a criterion characterizing Fedosov connections. As a consequence, a geometric realization is obtained for the equivalence between an arbitrary *-product and a Fedosov one. Every Fedosov *-product is shown to be a Vey *-product. Consequently, one obtains that every *-product is equivalent to a Vey * -product, a classical result of Lichnerowicz. Quantization of a hamiltonian G-space, and in particular, quantum momentum maps are studied. Lagrangian submanifolds are also studied under a deformation quantization.
