This paper is mostly a survey, with a few new results. The first part deals with functional equations for q-exponentials, q-binomials and q-logarithms in q-commuting variables and more generally under q-Heisenberg relations. The second part discusses translation invariance of Jackson integrals, q-Fourier transforms and the braided line.
