Symmetric Jack polynomials arise naturally in several contexts, including statistics, physics, combinatorics, and representation theory. They are pairwise orthogonal with repsect to two different inner products, the first defined by integration over an n-dimensional torus, and the second defined via a power series expansion.   The nonsymmetric analogs of Jack polynomials were recently defined by Opdam via the first inner product. In this paper we show that they are also orthogonal with respect to an analog of the second product which was proposed by Dunkl. We also derive an explict formula for their norms.
