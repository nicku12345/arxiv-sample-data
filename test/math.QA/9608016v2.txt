We show that the bicovariant first order differential calculi on a factorisable semisimple quantum group are in 1-1 correspondence with irreducible representations V of the quantum group enveloping algebra. The corresponding calculus is constructed and has dimension dim V^2. The differential calculi on a finite group algebra C G are also classified and shown to be in correspondence with pairs consisting of an irreducible representation V and a continuous parameter in C P^{dim V -1}. They have dimension dim V. For a classical Lie group we obtain an infinite family of non-standard calculi. General constructions for bicovariant calculi and their quantum tangent spaces are also obtained.
