We consider a modified version of the coproduct for \U(\su_q(2)) and show that in the limit when q \rightarrow 1, there exists an essentially non-cocommutative coproduct. We study the implications of this non-cocommutativity for a system of two spin-1/2 particles. Here it is shown that, unlike the usual case, this non-trivial coproduct allows for symmetric and anti-symmetric states to be present in the multiplet. We surmise that our analysis could be related to the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases of the Heisenberg magnets.
