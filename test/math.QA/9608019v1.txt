We consider Hopf bimodules and crossed modules over a Hopf algebra H in a braided category. They are the key-stones for braided bicovariant differential calculi and their invariant vector fields respectively, as well as for the construction of braided Hopf algebra cross products. We show that the notions of Hopf bimodules and crossed modules are equivalent. A generalization of the Radford-Majid criterion to the braided case is given and it is seen that bialgebra cross products over the Hopf algebra H are precisely described by H-crossed module bialgebras. We study the theory of (bicovariant) differential calculi in braided abelian categories and we construct \NN_0-graded bicovariant differential calculi out of first order bicovariant differential calculi. These objects are shown to be Hopf algebra differential calculi with universal bialgebra properties in the braided \NN_0-graded category.
