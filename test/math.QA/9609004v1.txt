The purpose of this article is to define the topological realization of a simplicial presheaf and to prove (under appropriate conditions) that it is homotopy-invariant under Illusie weak equivalence. In particular this applies to the site of schemes over Spec (\cc) with the etale or Zariski topologies. As an application we show how to calculate the topological realization of a Deligne-Mumford stack. At the end we speculate on how to extend this to the case of n-topoi.
