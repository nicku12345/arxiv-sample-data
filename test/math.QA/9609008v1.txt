We define a three-parameter deformation of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra that generalizes the q-oscillator algebra. By a purely algebraical procedure, we set up on this quantum space two differential calculi that are shown to be invariant on the same quantum group, extended to a ten-generator Hopf-star-algebra. We prove that, when the values of the parameters are related, the two differential calculi reduce to one that is invariant under two quantum groups.
