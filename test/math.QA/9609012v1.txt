We present some results concerning the generalized homologies associated with nilpotent endomorphisms d such that d^N=0 for some integer N\geq 2. We then introduce the notion of graded q-differential algebra and describe some examples. In particular we construct the q-analog of the simplicial differential on forms, the q-analog of the Hochschild differential and the q-analog of the universal differential envelope of an associative unital algebra.
