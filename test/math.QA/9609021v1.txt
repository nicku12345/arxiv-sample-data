Multi-parameter versions U_p(g) and C_p[G] of the standard quantum groups U_q(g) and C_q[G] are considered where G is a semi-simple connected complex algebraic group and g is the Lie algebra of G. The primitive spectrum of C_p[G] is calculated, generalizing a result of Joseph for the standard quantum groups. This classification is compared with the classification of symplectic leaves for the associated Poisson structure on G.
