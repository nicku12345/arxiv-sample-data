A construction is given of a family of non-standard quantizations of the algebra of functions on a connected complex semi-simple algebraic group. For each ``disjoint'' triple in the sense of Belavin and Drinfeld, a 2-cocycle is constructed on certain multi-parameter quantum groups. The new non-standard quantum groups are the Hopf algebras obtained by twisting the known quantum groups by these 2-cocycles. In particular, the Cremmer-Gervais quantization of SL(3) can be constructed in this way.
