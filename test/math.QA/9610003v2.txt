We demonstrate our recent general results on the Casimir construction and moduli space of all bicovariant calculi by means of some detailed examples, including finite-difference and 2-jet cacluli on \R^n and full details of the Casimir construction of the 4D calculus of SU_q(2). We likewise demonstrate our previous general constructions with T. Brzezinski of quantum group gauge theory with examples of such nonuniversal differential calculi on spacetime. We outline a notion of quantum homotopy of a quantum space. We indicate a possible application to classical integrable systems.
