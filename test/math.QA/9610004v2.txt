We obtain new family of quasitriangular Hopf algebras C^{0|n}_q\lcross \widetilde{U_q(su_n)}\rcross C^{0|n}_q via the author's recent double-bosonisation construction for new quantum groups. They are versions of U_q(su_{n+1}) with a fermionic rather than bosonic quantum plane of roots adjoined to U_q(su_n). We give the n=2 case in detail. We also consider the anyonic-double of an anyonic (Z/nZ-graded) braided group and the double-bosonisation of the free braided group in n variables.
