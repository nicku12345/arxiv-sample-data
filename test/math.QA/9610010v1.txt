The contraction method applied to the construction of the nonsemisimple quantum symplectic Cayley-Klein groups  Fun(Sp_q(n;j)) . This groups has been realised as Hopf algebra of the noncommutative functions over the algebra with nilpotent generators. The dual quantum algebras  sp_q(n;j)  are constructed.
