The similarity transformations of quantum orthogonal groups are developed and FRT theory is reformulated to the Cartesian basis. The quantum orthogonal Cayley-Klein groups are introduced as the algebra functions over an associative algebra with the nilpotent generators. The quantum orthogonal Cayley-Klein algebras are obtained as the dual objects to the corresponding quantum groups.
