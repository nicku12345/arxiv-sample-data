Heckman and Opdam introduced a non-symmetric analogue of Jack polynomials using Cherednik operators. In this paper, we derive a simple recursion formula for these polynomials and formulas relating the symmetric Jack polynomials with the non-symmetric ones. These formulas are then implemented by a closed expression of symmetric and non-symmetric Jack polynomials in terms of certain tableaux. The main application is a proof of a conjecture of Macdonald stating certain integrality and positivity properties of Jack polynomials.
