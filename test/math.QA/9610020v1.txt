It is known that the semi-infinite cohomology spaces of the infinitely twisted nilpotent subalgebra in an affine Lie algebra g with coefficients in an integrable simple module over the affine Lie algebra have a base enumerated by elements of the corresponding affine Weyl group graded by the semiinfinite length function. Let U be the affine quantum group corresponding to g. It is possible to define a subalgebra in U being the quantum analogue of the universal enveloping algebra of the infinitely twisted nilpotent subalgebra in g. In this paper we prove that for general values of the parameter v the semiinfinite cohomology of this associative algebra with coefficients in an integrable simple module over U coincides with the one of the corresponding Lie subalgebra in g with coefficients in the corresponding g-module.
