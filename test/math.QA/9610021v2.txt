A two parametric deformation of the enveloping Heisenberg algebra {\cal H}(4) which appear as a combination of the standard and a nonstandard quantization given by Ballesteros and Herranz is defined and proved to be Ribbon Hopf algebra. The universal {\cal R}-matrix and its associated quantum group are constructed. New solution of Braid group are obtained. The contribution of these parameters in invariants of links and WZW model are analyzed. General results for twisted Ribbon Hopf algebra are derived.
