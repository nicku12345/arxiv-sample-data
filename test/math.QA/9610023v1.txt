For the current realization of the affine quantum groups, a simple comultiplication for the quantum current operators was given by Drinfeld. With this comultiplication, we prove that, for the integrable modules of U_q(\hat {\frak sl}(2)) of level k+1, x^\pm(z)x^\pm(zq^{\pm 2}) \cdot\cdot\cdot x^\pm(zq^{\pm 2k}) are vertex operators satisfying certain q-difference equations, and we derive the quantum parafermions of U_q(\hat {\frak sl}(2)).
