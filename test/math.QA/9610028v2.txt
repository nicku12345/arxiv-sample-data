An invariant \mu_{\alpha}(K) of fibred knots K in a homology sphere is defined for each \alpha \in {\bold S}{\bold U}_n as follows. Since the knot is fibred, the knot complement is described by an element of the mapping class group, which induces an action on the variety of {\bold S}{\bold U}_n representations of the surface group. Restricting attention to those representations with holonomy along the longitude conjugate to a \in {\bold S}{\bold U}_n, one can define \mu_{\alpha}(K) to be the Lefschetz number of this action. The dependence of \mu_\alpha(K) on \alpha is studied and formulas relating \mu_{\alpha}(K) to \mu_{\beta}(K) are derived for \alpha,\beta \in   {\bold S}{\bold U}_n.
