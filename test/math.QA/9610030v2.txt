In this paper we construct explicitly the quantization of Lie bialgebras of \g-valued functions on a punctured rational or elliptic curve, where \g is a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra. by reducing the problem of quantization of the algebra of \g-valued functions on a curve with many punctures to the case of one puncture.
