By solving a set of recursion relations for the matrix elements of the {\cal U}_h(sl(2)) generators, the finite dimensional highest weight representations of the algebra were obtained as factor representations. Taking a nonlinear combination of the generators of the two copies of the {\cal U}_h(sl(2)) algebra, we obtained {\cal U}_h(so(4)) algebra. The latter, on contraction, yields {\cal U}_h(e(3)) algebra. A nonlinear map of {\cal U}_h(e(3)) algebra on its classical analogue e(3) was obtained. The inverse mapping was found to be singular. It signifies a physically interesting situation, where in the momentum basis, a restricted domain of the eigenvalues of the classical operators is mapped on the whole real domain of the eigenvalues of the deformed operators.
