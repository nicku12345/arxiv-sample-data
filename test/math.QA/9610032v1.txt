We apply the technique of affine Hecke algebras to the invariant theory of the "queer" Lie superalgebra q_N. We give explicit formulas for the elements of a distinguished basis in the centre of U(q_N), determined by "vanishing" conditions. We evaluate the corresponding differential operators on C^{N|N}\otimes C^{M|M}. In particular, we obtain an analogue for q_N of the classical Capelli identity.
