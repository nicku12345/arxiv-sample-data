Certain types of generalized undeformed and deformed boson algebras which admit a Hopf algebra structure are introduced, together with their Fock-type representations and their corresponding R-matrices. It is also shown that a class of generalized Heisenberg algebras including those algebras including those underlying physical models such as that of Calogero-Sutherland, is isomorphic with one of the types of boson algebra proposed, and can be formulated as a Hopf algebra.
