Shiraishi's two parameter generalization of U_{q}(sl(2)) to U_{q,p}(sl(2)) involving an elliptic function is considered. The generators are mapped non-linearly on those of U_{q}(sl(2)). This gives directly the irreducible representations and an induced Hopf structure. This is one particular example of the scope of a class of non-linear maps introduced by us recently.
