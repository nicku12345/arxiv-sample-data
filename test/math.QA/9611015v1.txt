A two-parametric generalization of the Jordanian deformation U_h (sl(2)) of sl(2) is presented. This involves Jacobian elliptic functions. In our deformation U_{(h,k)}(sl(2)), for k^2=1 one gets back U_h(sl(2)). The constuction is presented via a nonlinear map on sl(2). This invertible map directly furnishes the highest weight irreducible representations of U_{(h,k)}(sl(2)). This map also provides two distinct induced Hopf stuctures, which are exhibited. One is induced by the classical sl(2) and the other by the distinct one of U_h(sl(2)). Automorphisms related to the two periods of the elliptic functions involved are constructed. Translations of one generator by half and quarter periods lead to interesting results in this context. Possibilities of applications are discussed briefly.
