A braided tensor category FM_{\kappa} of `factorizable D-modules' over configuration spaces is introduced, analogous to the category FS_q of factorizable sheaves from q-alg/9604001. This category is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of a complex semisimple Lie algebra \frak{g}, with the Drinfeld's Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov tensor product. This description, together with the result of op.cit., gives a new, "Riemann-Hilbert" proof of the Drinfeld's theorem establishing an equivalence of the above tensor category with the category of finite dimensional U_q\frak{g}-modules (q=\exp(2\pi i/kappa), \kappa irrational).
