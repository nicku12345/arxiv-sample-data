Lickorish's method for constructing topological invariants of 3 - manifolds is generalized to the quantum supergroup setting. An invariant is obtained by applying this method to the Kauffman polynomial arising from the vector representation of Uq(osp(1|2)). A transparent proof is also given showing that this invariant is equivalent to the Uq(osp(1|2)) invariant obtained in an earlier publication.
