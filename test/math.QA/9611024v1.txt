The structure and representations of the quantum general linear supergroup GLq(m|n) are studied systematically by investigating the Hopf superalgebra Gq of its representative functions. Gq is factorized into Gq^{\pi} Gq^{\bar\pi}, and a Peter - Weyl basis is constructed for each factor. Parabolic induction for the quantum supergroup is developed. The underlying geometry of induced representations is discussed, and an analog of Frobenius reciprocity is obtained. A quantum Borel - Weil theorem is proven for the covariant and contravariant tensorial irreps, and explicit realizations are given for classes of tensorial irreps in terms of sections of quantum super vector bundles over quantum projective superspaces.
