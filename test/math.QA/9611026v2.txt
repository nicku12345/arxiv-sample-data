In order to construct a representation of the tangle category one needs an enhanced R-matrix. In this paper we define a sufficient and necessary condition for enhancement that can be checked easily for any R-matrix. If the R-matrix can be enhanced, we also show how to construct the additional data that define the enhancement. As a direct consequence we find a sufficient condition for the construction of a knot invariant.
