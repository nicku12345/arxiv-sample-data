For an abelian group G we consider braiding in a category of G-graded modules M^{kG} given by a bicharacter \chi on G. For (G,\chi)-bialgebra A in M^{kG} an analog of Lie bracket is defined. This bracket is determined by a linear map E\in\End(A) and n-ary operations \Omega^{n}_{E} on A. Our result states that if E(1)=0,E^{2}=0 and \Omega^{3}_{E}=0 then a braided Jacobi identity holds and the linear map E is a braided derivation of a braided Lie algebra.
