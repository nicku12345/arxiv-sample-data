We study the tensor category \cQ of tilting modules over a quantum group U_q with divided powers. The set X_+ of dominant weights is a union of closed alcoves \oC_w numbered by the elements w\in W^f of a certain subset of affine Weyl group W. G.Lusztig and N.Xi defined a partition of W^f into canonical right cells and the right order \le_R on the set of cells. For a cell A\subset W^f we consider a full subcategory \cQ_{<A} formed by direct sums of tilting modules Q(\lambda) with highest weights \lambda \in \bigcup_{w\in B<_RA} \oC_w. We prove that \cQ_{<A} is a tensor ideal in \cQ, generalizing H.Andersen's Theorem about the ideal of negligible modules which in our notations is nothing else then \cQ_{<\{ e\}}. The proof is an application of a recent result by W.Soergel who has computed the characters of tilting modules.
