The set of primitive elements of a Hopf algebra in the braided category of group graded vector spaces (with a commutative group) carry the structure of a generalized Lie algebra. In particular the graded derivations of an associative algebra carry this Lie algebra structure. The Lie multiplications consist of certain n-ary partially defined multiplications satisfying generalized antisymmetry and Jacobi identities. This generalizes the concept of Lie super algebras and Lie color algebras.   We show that universal enveloping algebras in the braided category exist. They are (braided) Hopf algebras. This explains many constructions of noncommutative noncocommutative Hopf algebras in the literature.
