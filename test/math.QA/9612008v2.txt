The particles with a scattering matrix R(x) are defined as operators \Phi_i(z) satisfying the relation  R_{i,j}^{j',i'}(x_1/x_2) \Phi_{i'}(x_1)\Phi_{j'}(x_2)= \Phi_i(x_2)\Phi_j(x_1). The algebra generated by those operators is called a Zamolochikov algebra. We construct a new Hopf algebra by adding half of the FRTS construction of a quantum affine algebra with this R(x). Then we double it to obtain a new Hopf algebra such that the full FRTS construction of a quantum affine algebra is a Hopf subalgebra inside. Drinfeld realization of quantum affine algebras is included as an example. This is a further generalization of the constructions in q-alg/9608002.
