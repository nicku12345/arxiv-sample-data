We construct a commutative current operator \bar x^+(z) inside U_q(\hat{\frak sl}(2)). With this operator and the condition of quantum integrability on the quantum current of U_q(\hat{\frak sl}(2)), we derive the quantization of the semi-infinite construction of integrable modules of \hat{\frak sl}(2) with the current operator e(z) of \hat{\frak sl}(2). The quantization of the functional models for \hat{\frak sl}(2) are also given.
