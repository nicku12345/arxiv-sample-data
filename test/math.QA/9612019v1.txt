In this report we give an intrinsic treatment of the results we developed in a previous work connecting the differential calculi on Hopf algebras to the Drinfeld double. In the first place we recover that bicovariant bimodules are in one to one correspondence with the Drinfeld double representations; we then introduce a Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of functions and discuss the main result stating that each differential calculus is associated to a 1-cocycle satisfying an additional invariance condition with respect to a natural action. Defining a Hochschild cohomology of the double, the above invariance becomes a condition with respect to the enveloping algebra component of the double that must be added to the 1-cocycle relation.
