A family of deformed Hopf algebras corresponding to the classical maximal isometry algebras of zero-curvature N-dimensional spaces (the inhomogeneous algebras iso(p,q), p+q=N, as well as some of their contractions) are shown to have a bicrossproduct structure. This is done for both the algebra and, in a low-dimensional example, for the (dual) group aspects of the deformation.
