The spinor representation of the quantum group U_q(su(N)) is given in terms of a set of fermion creation and annihilation operators. It is shown that the q-fermion operators introduced earlier can be identifi ed with the conventional fermion operators. Algebra homomorphisms mapping the fermion operators to their t ensor products are discussed. The relation of the coproduct of the quantum group to the above algebra homo morphisms is obtained.
