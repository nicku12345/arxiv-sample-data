The generators (J_{\pm}, J_0) of the algebra U_q(sl(2)) is our starting point. An invertible nonlinear map involving, apart from q, a second arbitrary complex parameter h, defines a triplet ({\hat X},{\hat Y},{\hat H}). The latter set forms a closed algebra under commutation relations. The nonlinear algebra U_{q,h}(sl(2)), thus generated, has two different limits. For q \to 1, the Jordanian h-deformation U_{h}(sl(2)) is obtained. For h \to 0, the q-deformed algebra U_{q}(sl(2)) is reproduced. From the nonlinear map, the irreducible representations of the doubly-deformed algebra U_{q,h}(sl(2)) may be directly and explicitly obtained form the known representations of the algebra U_q(sl(2)). Here we consider only generic values of q.
