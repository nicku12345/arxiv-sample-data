We classify 0-dimensional spectral triples over complex and real algebras and provide some general statements about their differential structure. We investigate also whether such spectral triples admit a symmetry arising from the Hopf algebra structure of the finite algebra. We discuss examples of commutative algebras and groups algebras.
