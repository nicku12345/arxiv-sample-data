We consider some general aspects of the new noncommutative or quantum geometry coming out of the theory of quantum groups, in connection with Planck scale physics. A generalisation of Fourier or wave-particle duality on curved spaces emerges. Another feature is the need for particles with fractional or braid statistics. The conformal group also has a special role.
