Inspired by a result in [Ga], we locate two  k[q,q^{-1}] -integer forms of  F_q[SL(n+1)] , along with a presentation by generators and relations, and prove that for  q=1  they specialize to  U({\mathfrak{h}}) , where  {\mathfrak{h}}  is the Lie bialgebra of the Poisson Lie group  H  dual of  SL(n+1) ; moreover, we explain the relation with [loc. cit.]. In sight of this, we prove two PBW-like theorems for  F_q[SL(n+1)] , both related to the classical PBW theorem for  U({\mathfrak{h}}) .
