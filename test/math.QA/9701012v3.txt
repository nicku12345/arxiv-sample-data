We give a new construction of the moonshine VOA V^{\natural} over the real number field. We proved that V^{\natural} has a positive definite invariant bilinear form and its full automorphism group is the Monster simple group. We also construct an infinite series of meromorphic VOAs whose full automorphism groups are finite. We calculate the trace form on V^{\natural} for some element of the Monster.
