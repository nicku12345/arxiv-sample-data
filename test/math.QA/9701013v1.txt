This paper contains a proof that chromatic weight systems, introduced by Chmutov, Duzhin and Lando, can be expressed in terms of weight systems associated with direct sums of the Lie algebras gl_n and so_n. As a consequence the Vassiliev invariants of knots corresponding to the chromatic weight systems distinguish exactly the same knots as a one variable specialisation Y of the Homfly and Kauffman polynomial.
