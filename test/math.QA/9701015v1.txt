Free coherent states for a system with two degrees of freedom is defined. Existence of the homeomorphism of the ring of integer 2-adic numbers to the set of coherent states corresponding to an eigenvalue of the operator of annihilation is proved. It is shown that the metric of free Fock space induces the 2-adic topology on the set of coherent states.
