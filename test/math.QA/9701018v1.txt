In this paper we define an algebra structure on the vector space L(\Sigma) generated by links in the manifold \Sigma \times [0,1] where \Sigma  is an oriented surface. This algebra has a filtration and the associated graded algebra L_{Gr}(\Sigma) is naturally a Poisson algebra. There is a Poisson algebra homomorphism from the algebra of chord diagrams ch(\Sigma) on \Sigma  to L_{Gr}(\Sigma).   We show that multiplication in L(\Sigma) provides a geometric way to define a deformation quantization of the algebra of chord diagrams, provided there is a universal Vassiliev invariant for links in \Sigma\times [0,1]. The quantization descends to a quantization of the moduli space of flat connections on \Sigma  and it is universal with respect to group homomorphisms. If \Sigma  is compact with free fundamental group we construct a universal Vassiliev invariant.
