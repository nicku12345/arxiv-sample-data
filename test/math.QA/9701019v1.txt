For each skein module we describe a homology theory which, for any three manifold recovers the skein module at its zero level. The theory measures skein-like relations among skein relations, mimicking Hilbert's theory of syzygies. We work explicit examples for the homology groups corresponding to the Kauffman bracket. It is shown, in particular, that for every manifold most of the groups are non-trivial.
