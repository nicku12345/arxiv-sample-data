Tensor products of irreducible representations of the Jordanian quantum algebras U_h(sl(2)) and U_h(su(1,1)) are considered. For both the highest weight finite dimensional representations of U_h(sl(2)) and lowest weight infinite dimensional ones of U_h(su(1,1)), it is shown that tensor product representations are reducible and that the decomposition rules to irreducible representations are exactly the same as those of corresponding Lie algebras.
