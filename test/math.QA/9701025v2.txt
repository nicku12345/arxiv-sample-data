We derive a free boson representation of the Yangian double DY_\hbar(sl_N) with arbitrary level k using the observation that there is a correspondence between the q-affine algebra and Yangian double associated with the same Cartan matrix. Vertex operator and screening currents are not obtained in the same way.
