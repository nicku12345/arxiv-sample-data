All possible Lie bialgebra structures on the harmonic oscillator algebra are explicitly derived and it is shown that all of them are of the coboundary type. A non-standard quantum oscillator is introduced as a quantization of a triangular Lie bialgebra, and a universal R-matrix linked to this new quantum algebra is presented.
