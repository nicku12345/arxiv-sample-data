Let X=GM be a finite group factorisation. It is shown that the quantum double D(H) of the associated bicrossproduct Hopf algebra H=kM\cobicross k(G) is itself a bicrossproduct kX\cobicross k(Y) associated to a group YX, where Y=G\times M^{op}. This provides a class of bicrossproduct Hopf algebras which are quasitriangular. We also construct a subgroup Y^\theta X^\theta associated to every order-reversing automorphism \theta of X. The corresponding Hopf algebra kX^\theta\cobicross k(Y^\theta) has the same coalgebra as H. Using related results, we classify the first order bicovariant differential calculi on H in terms of orbits in a certain quotient space of X.
