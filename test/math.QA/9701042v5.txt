We consider a central extension of the mapping class group of a surface with a collection of framed colored points. The Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs associated to SU(2) and SO(3) induce linear representations of this group. We show that the denominators of matrices which describe these representation over a cyclotomic field can be restricted in many cases. In this way, we give a proof of the known result that if the surface is a torus and there are no colored points, the representations have finite image.
