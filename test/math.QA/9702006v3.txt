We study permutation type solutions to n-simplex equations, that is, solutions whose R matrix can be written as a product of delta- functions depending linearly on the indices. With this ansatz the D^{n(n+1)} equations of the n-simplex equation reduce to an [n(n+1)/2+1]x[n(n+1)/2+1] matrix equation over Z_D. We have completely analyzed the 2-, 3- and 4-simplex equations in the generic D case. The solutions show interesting patterns that seem to continue to still higher simplex equations.
