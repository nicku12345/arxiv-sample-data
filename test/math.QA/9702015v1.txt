We define closed model category structures on different categories connected to the world of operad algebras over the category C(k) of (unbounded) complexes of k-modules: on the category of operads, on the category of algebras over a fixed operad, on the category of modules over a fixed operad algebra. In Sections 2 - 6 we define the necessary structures and provide some standard comparison results. In Section 7 we define cotangent complex. In Section 8 we define a canonical structure of homotopy Lie algebra on the tangent complex.
