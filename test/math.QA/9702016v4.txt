The paper is the sequel to q-alg/9704011. We extend the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction procedure to q-difference operators associated with arbitrary semisimple Lie algebras. This leads to a new elliptic deformation of the Lie bialgebra structure on the associated loop algebra. The related classical r-matrix is explicitly described in terms of the Coxeter transformation. We also present a cross-section theorem for q-gauge transformations which generalizes a theorem due to R.Steinberg.
