Recently, Andrews and Berkovich introduced a trinomial version of Bailey's lemma. In this note we show that each ordinary Bailey pair gives rise to a trinomial Bailey pair. This largely widens the applicability of the trinomial Bailey lemma and proves some of the identities proposed by Andrews and Berkovich.
