In the paper we formulate and verify a difference counterpart of the Macdonald-Mehta conjecture and its generalization for the Macdonald polynomials. Namely, we determine the Fourier transforms of the polynomials multiplied by the Gaussian, which is closely connected with the new difference Harish-Chandra theory.
