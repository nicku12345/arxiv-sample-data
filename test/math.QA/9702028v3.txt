We introduce a new class of 2-cocycles defined explicitly on the generators of certain multiparameter standard quantum groups. These allow us, through the process of twisting the familiar standard quantum groups, to generate new as well as previously known examples of non-standard quantum groups. In particular we are able to construct generalisations of both the Cremmer-Gervais deformation of SL(3) and the so called esoteric quantum groups of Fronsdal and Galindo in an explicit and straightforward manner.
