We construct a family of intertwining operators (screening operators) between various Fock space modules over the deformed W_n algebra. They are given as integrals involving a product of screening currents and elliptic theta functions. We derive a set of quadratic relations among the screening operators, and use them to construct a Felder-type complex in the case of the deformed W_3 algebra.
