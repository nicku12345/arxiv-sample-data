This article is devoted to the investigation of the deformation (twisting) of monoidal structures, such as the associativity constraint of the monoidal category and the monoidal structure of monoidal functor. The sets of twistings have a (non-abelian) c ohomological nature. Using this fact the maps from the sets of twistings to some cohomology groups (Hochschild cohomology of K-theory) are constructed. The examples of monoidal categories of bimodules over some algebra, modules and comodules over bialgeb ra are examined. We specially concentrate on the case of free tensor category.
