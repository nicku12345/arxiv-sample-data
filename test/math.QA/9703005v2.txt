A very well known result by Harish-Chandra claims that any Hermitian symmetric space of non-compact type admits a canonical embedding into a complex vector space V. The image of this embedding is a bounded symmetric domain in V. This work provides a construction of q-analogues of a polynomial algebra on V and the differential algebra of exterior forms on V. A way of producing a q-analogue of the bounded function algebra in a bounded symmetric domain is described. All the constructions are illustrated by detailed calculations in the case of the simplest Hermitian symmetric space SU(1,1)/U(1). The development of these ideas can be found in math.QA/9803110 and math.QA/9809038 .
