Using the isomorphism between highest weight U_q(sl_2)-modules and homologies of certain local systems on the configuration spaces, constructed by Varchenko, we give a geometric construction of the dual of the Lusztig's canonical basis in a tensor product of irreducible finite-dimensional U_q(sl_2)-modules.
