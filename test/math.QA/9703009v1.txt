We prove that Bargmann representations exist for some deformed harmonic oscillators that admit non-Fock representations. In specific cases, we explicitly obtain the resolution of the identity in terms of a true integral on the complex plane. We prove on explicit examples that Bargmann representations cannot always be found, particularly when the coherent states do not exist in the whole complex plane.
