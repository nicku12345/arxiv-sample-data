Representation theory for the Jordanian quantum algebra U=U_h(sl(2)) is developed. Closed form expressions are given for the action of the generators of U on the basis vectors of finite dimensional irreducible representations. It is shown how representation theory of U has a close connection to combinatorial identities involving summation formulas. A general formula is obtained for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients C^{j_1,j_2,j}_{n_1,n_2,m}(h) of U. These Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are shown to coincide with those of su(2) for n_1+n_2 \leq m, but for n_1+n_2 > m they are in general a nonzero monomial in h^{n_1+n_2-m}.
