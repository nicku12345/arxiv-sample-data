We review several fermionic-type character formulae for the characters of the integrable highest weight modules of sl(n)^ at level l=1, and explain how they arise from a spinon basis for these modules. We also review how the Yangian Y(sl(n)) acts on the integrable (sl(n)^)_1 modules and we decompose the characters with respect to this Y(sl(n)) action.
