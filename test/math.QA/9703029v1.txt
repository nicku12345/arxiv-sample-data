The Lie algebra gl(lambda) dependent on the complex parameter lambda is a continuous version of the Lie algebra gl(inf) of infinite matrices with only finite number of nonzero entries. The gl(lambda) was first introduced by B.L.Feigin in [1] in connection with the Lie algebra cohomologies of the differential operators on the complex line. The paper is devoted to the representation theory of the gl(lambda). The Shapovalov's form determinant is calculated; it depends polynomially on lambda and the parameters of the representation. It is natural to include the Hamiltonian Lie algebra of functions on the hyperboloid to the range of gl(lambda), relating it to the value lambda = infinity. Thus, every family of representations of gl(lambda) depending holomorphically on lambda is associated with a holomorphic vector bundle on the Riemann sphere. The determinant of the Shapovalov's form thus determines the corresponding line bundle. The Chern class of this bundle is calculated in two different ways (for every level on the representation). The comparison of the two formulas yields new combinatorial identities with power series.   The results of Chapter 1 about the Lie algebra gl(inf) may have some independent interest.
