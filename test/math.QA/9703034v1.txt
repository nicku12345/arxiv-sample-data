The underlying algebra for a noncommutative geometry is taken to be a matrix algebra, and the set of derivatives the adjoint of a subset of traceless matrices. This is sufficient to calculate the dual 1-forms, and show that the space of 1-forms is a free module over the algebra of matrices. The concept of a generalised algebra is defined and it is shown that this is required in order for the space of 2-forms to exist. The exterior derivative is generalised for higher order forms and these are also shown to be free modules over the matrix algebra. Examples of mappings that preserve the differential structure are given. Also given are four examples of matrix generalised algebras, and the corresponding noncommutative geometries, including the cases where the generalised algebra corresponds to a representation of a Lie algebra or a q-deformed algebra.
