We consider nonquasiclassical solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and the corresponding quantum cogroups \Fun(SL(S)) constructed earlier by one of the authors . We give a criterion of the existence of a dual quasitriangular structure in the algebra \Fun(SL(S)) and describe a large class of such objects related to the Temperley-Lieb algebra satisfying this criterion. We show also that this dual quasitriangular structure is in some sense nondegenerate.
