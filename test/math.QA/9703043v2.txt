The classical limit of the scaled elliptic algebra A_{\hbar,\eta}(sl_2) is investigated. The limiting Lie algebra is described in two equivalent ways: as a central extension of the algebra of generalized automorphic sl_2 valued functions on a strip and as an extended algebra of decreasing automorphic sl_2 valued functions on the real line. A bialgebra structure and an infinite-dimensional representation in the Fock space are studied. The classical limit of elliptic algebra A_{q,p}(sl_2) is also briefly presented.
