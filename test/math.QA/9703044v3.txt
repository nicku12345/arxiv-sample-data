The trigonometric quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation (qKZ equation) associated with the quantum group U_q(sl_2) is a system of linear difference equations with values in a tensor product of U_q(sl_2) Verma modules. We solve the equation in terms of multidimensional q-hypergeometric functions and define a natural isomorphism between the space of solutions and the tensor product of the corresponding evaluation Verma modules over the elliptic quantum group E_{\rho,\gamma}(sl_2), where parameters \rho and \gamma are related to the parameter q of the quantum group U_q(sl_2) and the step p of the qKZ equation via p=e^{2\pii\rho} and q=e^{-2\pii\gamma}.   We construct asymptotic solutions associated with suitable asymptotic zones and compute the transition functions between the asymptotic solutions in terms of the dynamical elliptic R-matrices. This description of the transition functions gives a connection between representation theories of the quantum loop algebra U_q(\widetilde{gl}_2 and the elliptic quantum group E_{\rho,\gamma}(sl_2) and is analogous to the Kohno-Drinfeld theorem on the monodromy group of the differential Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation.   In order to establish these results we construct a discrete Gauss-Manin connection, in particular, a suitable discrete local system, discrete homology and cohomology groups with coefficients in this local system, and identify an associated difference equation with the qKZ equation.
