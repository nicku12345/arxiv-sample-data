Let B(\infty) be the crystal corresponding to the nilpotent part of a quantized Kac-Moody algebra. We suggest a general way to represent B(\infty) as the set of integer solutions of a system of linear inequalities. As an application, we treat in a unified manner all Kac-Moody algebras of rank 2 (sharpening the result by Kashiwara), as well as the algebras of types A_n and A_{n-1}^{(1)}.
