A full (triangular) quantum deformation of so(3,2) is presented by considering this algebra as the conformal algebra of the 2+1 dimensional Minkowskian spacetime. Non-relativistic contractions are analysed and used to obtain quantum Hopf structures for the conformal algebras of the 2+1 Galilean and Carroll spacetimes. Relations between the latter and the null-plane quantum Poincar\'e algebra are studied.
