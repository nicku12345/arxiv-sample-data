We consider a special category of Hopf algebras, depending on parameters \Sigma which possess properties similar to the category of representations of simple Lie group with highest weight \lambda. We connect quantum groups to minimal objects in this categories---they correspond to irreducible representations in the category of representations with highest weight \lambda. Moreover, we want to correspond quantum groups only to finite dimensional irreducible representations. This gives us a condition for \lambda: \lambda--- is dominant means the minimal object in the category of representations with highest weight \lambda is finite dimensional. We put similar condition for \Sigma. We call \Sigma dominant if the minimal object in corresponding category has polynomial growth. Now we propose to define quantum groups starting from dominant parameters \Sigma.
