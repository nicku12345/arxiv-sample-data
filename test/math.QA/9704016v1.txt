Using realisations of the positive discrete series representations of the Lie algebra su(1,1) in terms of Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials, the action of su(1,1) on Poisson kernels of these polynomials is considered. In the tensor product of two such representations, two sets of eigenfunctions of a certain operator can be considered and they are shown to be related through continuous Hahn polynomials. As a result, a bilinear generating function for continuous Hahn polynomials is obtained involving the Poisson kernel of Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials. For the positive discrete series representations of the quantised universal enveloping algebra Uq(su(1,1)) a similar analysis is performed and leads to a bilinear generating function for Askey-Wilson polynomials involving the Poisson kernel of Al-Salam and Chihara polynomials.
