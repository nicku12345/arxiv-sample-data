With slight modifications in the zero modes contributions, the positive and negative screening currents for the quantum deformed W-algebra W_{q,p}(g) can be put together to form a single algebra which can be regarded as an elliptic deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of \hat{g}, where g is any classical simply-laced Lie algebra.
