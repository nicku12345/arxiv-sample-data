The quantum double for the quantized BRST superalgebra is studied. The corresponding R-matrix is explicitly constucted. The Hopf algebras of the double form an analytical variety with coordinates described by the canonical deformation parameters. This provides the possibility to construct the nontrivial quantization of the proper time supergroup cotangent bundle. The group-like classical limit for this quantization corresponds to the generic super Lie bialgebra of the double.
