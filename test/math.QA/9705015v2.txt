We introduce an analogue of the q-Schur algebra associated to Coxeter systems of type \hat A_{n-1}. We give two constructions of this algebra. The first construction realizes the algebra as a certain endomorphism algebra arising from an affine Hecke algebra of type \hat A_{r-1}, where n \geq r. This generalizes the original q-Schur algebra as defined by Dipper and James, and the new algebra contains the ordinary q-Schur algebra and the affine Hecke algebra as subalgebras. Using this approach we can prove a double centralizer property. The second construction realizes the affine q-Schur algebra as the faithful quotient of the action of a quantum group on the tensor power of a certain module, analogous to the construction of the ordinary q-Schur algebra as a quotient of U(\frak g \frak l_n).
