Quantum homogeneous vector bundles are introduced by a direct description of their sections in the context of Woronowicz type compact quantum groups. The bundles carry natural topologies inherited from the quantum groups, and their sections furnish projective modules over algebras of functions on quantum homogeneous spaces. Further properties of the quantum homogeneous vector bundles are investigated, and their applications to the representation theory of quantum groups are explored. In particular, quantum Frobenius reciprocity and a generalized Borel-Weil theorem are established.
