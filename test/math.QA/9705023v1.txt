We review the construction of the multiparametric quantum group ISO_{q,r}(N) as a projection from SO_{q,r}(N+2)  and show that it is a bicovariant bimodule over SO_{q,r}(N). The universal enveloping algebra U_{q,r}(iso(N)), characterized as the Hopf algebra of regular functionals on ISO_{q,r}(N), is found as a Hopf subalgebra of U_{q,r}(so(N+2)) and is shown to be a bicovariant bimodule over U_{q,r}(so(N)). An R-matrix formulation of U_{q,r}(iso(N)) is given and we prove the pairing U_{q,r}(iso(N))\leftrightarrow ISO_{q,r}(N). We analyze the subspaces of U_{q,r}(iso(N)) that define bicovariant differential calculi on ISO_{q,r}(N).
