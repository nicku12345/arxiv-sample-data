We find the Hopf algebra U_{g,h} dual to the Jordanian matrix quantum group GL_{g,h}(2). As an algebra it depends only on the sum of the two parameters and is split in two subalgebras: U'_{g,h} (with three generators) and U(Z) (with one generator). The subalgebra U(Z) is a central Hopf subalgebra of U_{g,h}. The subalgebra U'_{g,h} is not a Hopf subalgebra and its coalgebra structure depends on both parameters. We discuss also two one-parameter special cases: g =h and g=-h. The subalgebra U'_{h,h} is a Hopf algebra and coincides with the algebra introduced by Ohn as the dual of SL_h(2). The subalgebra U'_{-h,h} is isomorphic to U(sl(2)) as an algebra but has a nontrivial coalgebra structure and again is not a Hopf subalgebra of U_{-h,h}.
