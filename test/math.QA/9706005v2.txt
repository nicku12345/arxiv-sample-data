We prove a refinement of Vogel's statement that the Vassiliev invariants of knots coming from semisimple Lie algebras do not generate all Vassiliev invariants. This refinement takes into account the second grading on Vassiliev invariants induced by cabling of knots. As an application we get an amelioration of the actually known lower bounds for the dimensions of the space of Vassiliev invariants.
