Let  \mathfrak{g}  be an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra over the field  K \, , and let  U_q(\mathfrak{g})  be the associated quantum enveloping algebra; let  \mathfrak{U}_q(g)  be the Lusztig's integer form of  U_q(\mathfrak{g}) \, , generated by  q -divided powers of Chevalley generators over a suitable subring  R  of  K(q) \, . We prove a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt like theorem for  \mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{g}) \, , yielding a basis over  R  made of ordered products of  q -divided powers of suitable quantum root vectors.
