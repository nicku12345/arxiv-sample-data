We consider the reflection equation algebra for a finite dimensional R-matrix for the (h,w)-deformed Heisenberg algebra {\cal U}_{h,w}(h(4)). A representation of the reflection matrix K is constructed using the matrix generators L^{(\pm)} of the {\cal U}_{h,w}(h(4)) algebra. A series of representations of the K-matrix then may be generated by using the coproduct rules of the {\cal U}_{h,w}(h(4)) algebra. The complementary condition necessary for combining two distinct solutions of the reflection equation algebra yields the braiding relations between these two sets of generators. This may be thought as a generalization of Bose-Fermi statistics to braiding statistics, which them may be used to provide a new braided colagebraic structure to a Hopf algebra generated by the elements of the matrix K. The reflection equation algebra and the braided exchange properties are found to depend on both deformation parameters h and w.
