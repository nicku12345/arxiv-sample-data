A class of transformations of R_q-matrices is introduced such that the q\to 1 limit gives explicit nonstandard R_{h}-matrices. The transformation matrix is singular itself at q\to 1 limit. For the transformed matrix, the singularities, however, cancel yielding a well-defined construction. Our method can be implemented systematically for R-matrices of all dimensions and not only for sl(2) but also for algebras of higher dimensions. Explicit constructions are presented starting with {\cal U}_q(sl(2)) and {\cal U}_q(sl(3)), while choosing R_q for (fund. rep.)\otimes(arbitrary irrep.). The treatment for the general case and various perspectives are indicated. Our method yields nonstandard deformations along with a nonlinear map of the h-Borel subalgebra on the corresponding classical Borel subalgebra. For {\cal U}_h(sl(2)) this map is extended to the whole algebra and compared with another one proposed by us previously.
