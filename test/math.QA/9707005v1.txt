The five parameter family of multivariable Askey-Wilson polynomials is studied with four parameters generically complex. The multivariable Askey-Wilson polynomials form an orthogonal system with respect to an explicit (in general complex) measure. A partially discrete orthogonality measure is obtained by shifting the contour to the torus while picking up residues. A parameter domain is given for which the partially discrete orthogonality measure is positive. The orthogonality relations and norm evaluations for multivariable q-Racah polynomials and multivariable big and little q-Jacobi polynomials are proved by taking suitable limits in the orthogonality relations for the multivariable Askey-Wilson polynomials. In particular new proofs of several well known q-analogues of the Selberg integral are obtained.
