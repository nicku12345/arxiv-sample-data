We give a detailed description of the adjoint representation of Drinfeld's twist element, as well as of its coproduct, for su_{q}(2). We also discuss, as applications, the computation of the universal R-matrix in this representation and the problem of symmetrization of identical-particle states with quantum su(2) symmetry.
