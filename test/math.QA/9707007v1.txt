We study deformations of the standard embedding of the Lie algebra \Vect(S^1) of smooth vector fields on the circle, into the Lie algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle T^*S^1 (with respect to the Poisson bracket). We consider two analogous but different problems: (a) formal deformations of the standard embedding of \Vect(S^1) into the Lie algebra of functions on \dot T^*S^1:=T^*S^1\setminusS^1 which are Laurent polynomials on fibers, and (b) polynomial deformations of the \Vect(S^1) subalgebra inside the Lie algebra of formal Laurent series on \dot T^*S^1.
