The prime spectra of two families of algebras, S^w and \check{S}^w, w\in W, indexed by the Weyl group W of a semisimple finitely dimensional are studied. The algebras S^w have been introduced by A.~Joseph; they are q-analogues of the algebras of regular functions on w-translates of the open Bruhat cell of a semisimple Lie group G corresponding to the Lie algebra \fg.   We define a stratification of the spectra into components indexed by pairs (y_1,y_2) of elements of the Weyl group satisfying y_1\leq w\leq y_2. Each component admits a unique minimal ideal which is explicitly described. We show the inclusion relation of closures to be that induced by Bruhat order.
