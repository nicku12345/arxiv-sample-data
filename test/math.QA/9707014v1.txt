We study, in the path realization, crystals for Demazure modules of affine Lie algebras of types A^{(1)}_n,B^{(1)}_n,C^{(1)}_n,D^{(1)}_n, A^{(2)}_{2n-1},A^{(2)}_{2n}, and D^{(2)}_{n+1}. We find a special sequence of affine Weyl group elements for the selected perfect crystal, and show if the highest weight is l\La_0, the Demazure crystal has a remarkably simple structure.
