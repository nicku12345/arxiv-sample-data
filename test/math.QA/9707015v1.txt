The well known incompatibility between inhomogeneous quantum groups and the standard q-deformation is shown to disappear (at least in certain cases) when admitting the quantum group to be braided. Braided quantum ISO(p,N-p) containing SO_q(p,N-p) with |q|=1 are constructed for N=2p, 2p+1, 2p+2. Their Poisson analogues (obtained first) are presented as an introduction to the quantum case.
