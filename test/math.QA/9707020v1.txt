Generalizing the case of the usual harmonic oscillator, we look for Bargmann representations corresponding to deformed harmonic oscillators. Deformed harmonic oscillator algebras are generated by four operators a, a^\dagger, N and the unity 1 such as [a,N] = a, [a^\dagger,N] = -a^\dagger, a^\dagger a = \psi(N) and aa^\dagger =\psi(N+1). We discuss the conditions of existence of a scalar product expressed with a true integral on the space spanned by the eigenstates of a (or a^\dagger). We give various examples, in particular we consider functions \psi that are linear combinations of q^N, q^{-N} and unity and that correspond to q-oscillators with Fock-representations or with non-Fock-representations.
