We study Hopf-Galois extensions with central invariants for a finite dimensional Hopf algebra. We collect general facts about them and discuss some examples arising in the study of restricted Lie algebras and quantum groups at roots of unity. Our focus is on representation theory and its special feature in this situation, restriction of the central character to the subalgebra of invariants.
