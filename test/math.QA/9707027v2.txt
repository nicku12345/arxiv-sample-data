Recently V.Drinfeld formulated a number of problems in quantum group theory. In particular, he suggested to consider ``set-theoretical'' solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, i.e. solutions given by a permutation R of the set X\times X, where X is a fixed finite set. In this note we study such solutions, which satisfy the unitarity and the crossing symmetry conditions -- natural conditions arising in physical applications. More specifically, we consider ``linear'' solutions: the set X is an abelian group, and the map R is an automorphism of X\times X. We show that in this case, solutions are in 1-1 correspondence with pairs a,b\in \End X, such that b is invertible and bab^{-1}=\frac{a}{a+1}. Later we consider ``affine'' solutions (R is an automorphism of X\times X as a principal homogeneous space), and show that they have a similar classification. The fact that these classifications are so nice leads us to think that there should be some interesting structure hidden behind this problem.
