For \g=sl(n) we construct a two parametric U_h(\g)-invariant family of algebras, (S\g)_{t,h}, which defines a quantization of the function algebra S\g on the coadjoint representation and in the parameter t gives a quantization of the Lie bracket. The family induces a two parametric deformation of the function algebra of any maximal orbit which is a quantization of the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau bracket in the parameter t. In addition we construct a quantum de Rham complex on \g^*.
