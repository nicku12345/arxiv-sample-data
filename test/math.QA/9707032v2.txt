For transcendental values of q all bicovariant first order differential calculi on the coordinate Hopf algebras of the quantum groups SL_q(n+1) and Sp_q(2n) are classified. It is shown that the irreducible bicovariant first order calculi are determined by an irreducible corepresentation of the quantum group and a complex number \zeta such that \zeta^{n+1}=1 for SL_q(n+1) and \zeta^2=1 for Sp_q(2n). Any bicovariant calculus is inner and its quantum Lie algebra is generated by a central element. The main technical ingredient is a result of the Hopf algebra R(G_q)^0 for arbitrary simple Lie algebras.
