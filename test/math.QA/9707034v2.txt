It is shown that the elliptic algebra {\cal A}_{q,p}(\hat{sl}(2)_c) at the critical level c=-2 has a multidimensional center containing some trace-like operators t(z). A family of Poisson structures indexed by a non-negative integer and containing the q-deformed Virasoro algebra is constructed on this center. We show also that t(z) close an exchange algebra when p^m=q^{c+2} for m integer, they commute when in addition p=q^{2k} for k integer non-zero, and they belong to the center of {\cal A}_{q,p}(\hat{sl}(2)_c) when k is odd. The Poisson structures obtained for t(z) in these classical limits contain the q-deformed Virasoro algebra, characterizing the structures at generic values of p, q and m as new {\cal W}_{q,p}(sl(2)) algebras.
