Let \Gamma be an N^2-dimensional bicovariant first order differential calculus on a Hopf algebra SL_q(N). There are three possibilities to construct a differential Z-graded Hopf algebra \Gamma^\wedge which contains \Gamma as its first order part. Let q be a transcendental complex number. For N>2 these three Z-graded Hopf algebras coincide. For Woronowicz' external algebra we calculate the dimensions of the spaces of left-invariant and bi-invariant k-forms. In this case each bi-invariant form is closed. In case of 4D_\pm calculi on SL_q(2) the universal calculus is strictly larger than the other two calculi. In particular, the bi-invariant 1-form is not closed.
