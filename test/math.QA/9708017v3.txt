Any deformation of a Weyl or Clifford algebra can be realized through a change of generators in the undeformed algebra. q-Deformations of Weyl or Clifford algebrae that were covariant under the action of a simple Lie algebra g are characterized by their being covariant under the action of the quantum group U_q g. We present a systematic procedure for determining all possible corresponding changes of generators, together with the corresponding realizations of the U_q g-action. The intriguing relation between g-invariants and U_q g-invariants suggests that these changes of generators might be employed to simplify the dynamics of some g-covariant quantum physical systems.
