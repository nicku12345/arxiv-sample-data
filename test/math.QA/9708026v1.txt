A version of quantum orbit method is presented for real forms of equal rank of quantum complex simple groups. A quantum moment map is constructed, based on the canonical isomorphism between a quantum Heisenberg algebra and an algebra of functions on a family of quantum G-spaces. For the series A, we construct some irreducible *-representations of U_q{\frak g} which correspond to the semi-simple dressing orbits of minimal dimension in the dual Poisson Lie group. It is shown that some complimentary series representations correspond to some quantum 'tunnel' G-spaces which do not have a quasi-classical analog.
