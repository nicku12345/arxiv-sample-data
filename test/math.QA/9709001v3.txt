We describe a bilinear identity satisfied by certain multidimensional q-hypergeometric integrals. The identity can be considered as a deformation of the Riemann bilinear relation for the twisted de Rham (co)homologies.   The identity also gives an explicit formula for scalar products of solutions of the qKZ and the dual qKZ equations, therefore providing a deformation of Gaudin-Korepin's formula for norms of the Bethe vectors.
