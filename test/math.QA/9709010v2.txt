We define an action of the symmetric group on the set of domino tableaux, and prove that the number of domino tableaux of a given weight does not depend on the permutation of components of the last. A bijective proof of the well-known result due to J. Stembridge that the number of self-evacuating tableaux of a given shape is equal to that of domino tableaux of the same shape is given.
