The purpose of this paper is to present an introduction to a point of view for discrete foundations of physics. In taking a discrete stance, we find that the initial expression of physical theory must occur in a context of noncommutative algebra and noncommutative vector analysis. In this way the formalism of quantum mechanics occurs first, but not necessarily with the usual interpretations. The basis for this work is a non-commutative discrete calculus and the observation that it takes one tick of the discrete clock to measure momentum.
