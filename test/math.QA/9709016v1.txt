We consider a pair of independent scalar products, one scalar product on vectors, and another independent scalar product on dual space of co-vectors. The Clifford co-product of multivectors is calculated from the dual Clifford algebra. With respect to this co-product unit is not group-like and vectors are not primitive. The Clifford product and the Clifford co-product fits to the bi-gebra with respect to the family of the (pre)-braids. The Clifford bi-gebra is in a braided category iff at least one of these scalar products vanish.
