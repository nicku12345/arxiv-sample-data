Let H be a Hopf algebra in a rigid braided monoidal category with split idempotents. We prove the existence of integrals on (in) H characterized by the universal property, employing results about Hopf modules, and show that their common target (source) object Int H is invertible. The fully braided version of Radford's formula for the fourth power of the antipode is obtained. Connections of integration with cross-product and transmutation are studied. The results apply to topological Hopf algebras, e.g. a torus with a hole, which do not have additive structure.
