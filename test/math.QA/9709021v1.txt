We explicitly construct a star product for the complex Grassmann manifolds using the method of phase space reduction. Functions on \mathbb{C}^{(p+q)\cdot p~*}, the space of (p+q)\times p matrices of rank p, invariant under the right action of Gl(p,\mathbb{C}) can be regarded as functions on the Grassmann manifold G_{p,q}(\mathbb{C}), but do not form a subalgebra whereas functions only invariant under the unitary subgroup U(p)\subset Gl(p,\mathbb{C}) do. The idea is to construct a projection from U(p)- onto Gl(p,\mathbb{C})-invariant functions, whose kernel is an ideal. This projection can be used to define a star-algebra on G_{p,q}(\mathbb{C}) onto which this projection acts as an algebra-epimorphism.
