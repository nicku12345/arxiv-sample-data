The differential and variational calculus on the SL_{q}(2,R) group is constructed. The spontaneous breaking symmetry in the WZNW model with SL_{q}(2,R) quantum group symmetry and in the \sigma-models with {SL_{q}(2,R)/U_{h}(1)} ,C_{q}(2|0) quantum group symmetry is considered. The Lagrangian formalism over the quantum group manifolds is discussed. The classical solution of C_{q}(2|0) {\sigma}-model is obtained.
