We formulate quantum group Riemannian geometry as a gauge theory of quantum differential forms. We first develop (and slightly generalise) classical Riemannian geometry in a self-dual manner as a principal bundle frame resolution and a dual pair of canonical forms. The role of Levi-Civita connection is naturally generalised to connections with vanishing torsion and cotorsion, which we introduce. We then provide the corresponding quantum group and braided group formulations with the universal quantum differential calculus. We also give general constructions for examples, including quantum spheres and quantum planes.
