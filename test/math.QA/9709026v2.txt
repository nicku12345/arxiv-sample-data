We consider the quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov difference equation (qKZ) with values in a tensor product of irreducible sl(2) modules, the equation defined in terms of rational R-matrices. We solve the equation in terms of multidimensional q-hypergeometric integrals. We identify the space of solutions of the qKZ equation with the tensor product of the corresponding modules over the quantum group U_qsl(2). We compute the monodromy of the qKZ equation in terms of the trigonometric R-matrices.
