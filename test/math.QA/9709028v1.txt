We study the vertex operators \Phi(z) associated with standard quantum groups. The element Z = RR^{t} is a "Casimir operator" for quantized Kac-Moody algebras and the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (q-KZ) equation is interpreted as the statement :Z\Phi(z): = \Phi(z). We study the covariance of the q-KZ equation under twisting, first within the category of Hopf algebras, and then in the wider context of quasi Hopf algebras. We obtain the intertwining operators associated with the elliptic R-matrix and calculate the two-point correlation function for the eight-vertex model.
