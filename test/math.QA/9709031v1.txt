A rational Ansatz is proposed for the generating function \sum_{j,k} \beta_{2j+k,2j}x^j y^k, where \beta_{m,u} is the number of primitive chinese character diagrams with u univalent and 2m-u trivalent vertices. For P_m:=\sum_{u\ge2}\beta_{m,u}, the conjecture leads to the sequence 1,1,1,2,3,5,8,12,18,27,39,55,\underline{78,108,150,207,284,388,532,726} for primitive chord diagrams of degrees m\le20, with predictions underlined. The asymptotic behaviour \lim_{m\to\infty}P_m/r^m= 1.06260548918755 results, with r=1.38027756909761 solving r^4=r^3+1. Vassiliev invariants of knots are then enumerated by 0,1,1,3,4,9,14,27,44, 80,132,232,\underline{384,659,1095,1851,3065,5128,8461,14031} and Vassiliev invariants of framed knots by 1,2,3,6,10,19,33,60,104,184,316, 548,\underline{932,1591,2686,4537,7602,12730,21191,35222} These conjectures are motivated by successful enumerations of irreducible Euler sums. Predictions for \beta_{15,10}, \beta_{16,12} and \beta_{19,16} suggest that the action of sl and osp Lie algebras, on baguette diagrams with ladder insertions, fails to detect an invariant in each case.
