The main aim of this paper is to give classes of irreducible infinite dimensional representations and of irreducible *-representations of the q-deformed algebra U'_q(so_{2,2}) which is a real form of the non-standard deformation U'_q(so_4) of the universal enveloping algebra U(so(4,C)). These representations are described by two complex parameters and are obtained by "analytical continuation" of the irreducible finite dimensional representations of the algebra U'_q(so_4) in the basis corresponding to the reduction from U'_q(so_4) to U(so_2\oplus so_2).
