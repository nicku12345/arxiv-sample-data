Based on Drinfeld realization of super Yangian Double DY(gl(1|1)), its pairing relations and universal R-matrix are given. By taking evaluation representation of universal R-matrix, another realization L^{\pm}(u) of DY(gl(1|1)) is obtained. These two realizations of DY(gl(1|1)) are related by the supersymmetric extension of Ding-Frenkel map.
