In this paper we show that the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (and, more generally, parabolic KL polynomials) for the group S_n coincide with the coefficients of the canonical basis in nth tensor power of the fundamental representation of the quantum group U_q sl_k. We also use known results about canonical bases for U_q sl_2 to get a new proof of recurrent formulas for KL polynomials for maximal parabolic subgroups (geometrically, this case corresponds to Grassmanians), due to Lascoux-Schutzenberger and Zelevinsky.
