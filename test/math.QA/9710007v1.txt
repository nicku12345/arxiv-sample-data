We study the restrictions of simple modules of Ariki-Koike algebras \H_m(\v) with set of parameters \v= (\zeta;\zeta^{v_0},... ,\zeta^{v_{l-1}}), where \zeta is an nth root of unity, to their subalgebras \H_{m-j}(\v). Using a theorem of Ariki and the crystal basis theory of Kashiwara, we relate this problem to the calculation of tensor product multiplicities of highest weight irreducible representations of the affine Lie algebra A_{n-1}^{(1)}. These multiplicities have a combinatorial description in terms of higher level paths or highest-lift multipartitions. This enables us to solve the Jantzen-Seitz problem for Ariki-Koike algebras, that is, to determine which irreducible representations of \H_m(\v) restrict to irreducible representations of \H_{m-1}(\v). From a combinatorial point of view, this problem is identical to that of computing the tensor product of an A_{n-1}^{(1)}-module of level l and one of level 1. We also consider natural generalisations of the Jantzen-Seitz problem corresponding to the product of a level l module by a level l'>1 module, and from the commutativity of tensor products, we deduce a remarkable symmetry between the generalised Jantzen-Seitz conditions and the sets of parameters of the Ariki-Koike algebras.
