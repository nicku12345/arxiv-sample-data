The extension of FRT quantization theory for the nonsemisimple CK groups is suggested. The quantum orthogonal CK groups are realized as the Hopf algebras of the noncommutative functions over an associative algebras with nilpotent commutative generators. The quantum CK algebras are obtained as the dual objects to the corresponding quantum groups.
