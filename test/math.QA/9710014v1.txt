This is a copy of the talk given at the conference ``Methods in Field Theory'' at Stara Lesna, The Slovak Republic, Sepemeber 22-26, 1997. An introduction to the noncommutative sphere and a summary of the results of articles q-alg/9703038 \cite{Gratus5}, and q-alg/9708003 \cite{Gratus6} is given. This includes results about the the algebra of scalar, spinor and vector fields on the noncommutative sphere. Possible extensions of these results including a ``Wick rotation'' to the one and two sheeted hyperboloid are also examined.
