Series of finite dimensional representations of the superalgebras spl(p,q) can be formulated in terms of linear differential operators acting on a suitable space of polynomials. We sketch the general ingredients necessary to construct these representations and present examples related to spl(2,1) and spl(2,2). By revisiting the products of projectivised representations of sl(2), we are able to construct new sets of differential operators preserving some space of polynomials in two or more variables. In particular, this allows to express the representation of spl(2,1) in terms of matrix differential operators in two variables. The corresponding operators provide the building blocks for the construction of quasi exactly solvable systems of two and four equations in two variables. We also present a quommutator deformation of spl(2,1) which, by construction, provides an appropriate basis for analyzing the quasi exactly solvable systems of finite difference equations.
