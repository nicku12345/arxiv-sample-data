We introduce a class of induced representations of the degenerate double affine Hecke algebra of gl_N and analyze their structure mainly by means of intertwiners. We also construct them from modules of the affine Lie algebra using Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connections in the conformal field theory. This construction provides a natural quotient of induced modules, which turns out to be the unique irreducible one under a certain condition. Some cunjectual formulas are presented for the symmetric part of these quotients.
