We examine two isomorphisms between affine Hecke algebras of type A associated with parameters q^{-1}, t^{-1} and q, t. One of them maps the non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials E_{\eta}(x;q^{-1},t^{-1}) onto E_{\eta}(x;q,t), while the other maps them onto non-symmetric analogues of the multivariable Al-Salam & Carlitz polynomials. Using the properties of E_{\eta}(x;q^{-1},t^{-1}), the corresponding properties of these latter polynomials can then be elucidated.
