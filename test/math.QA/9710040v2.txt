We consider the sl(2) quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation (qKZ), defined in terms of rational R-matrices. The properties of the equation change when the step of the equation takes a resonance value. In this case the discrete connection defined by the qKZ equation has a invariant subbundle which we call the subbundle of quantized conformal blocks. Solutions of the qKZ equation were constructed in [TV1], [MV1] in terms of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we show that for a resonance step all hypergeometric solutions take values in the subbundle of quantized conformal blocks, moreover the values span the subbundle of quantized conformal blocks under certain conditions. We describe the space of hypergeometric solutions in terms of the quantum group U_qsl(2).
