For any module M over small quantum group one defines the support variety using construction from the theory of restricted Lie algebras. It is a closed conical subset of nilpotent cone of the corresponding Lie algebra. If module M is a module over the quantum group U_{\xi} with divided powers then its support variety is invariant under the action of the corresponding algebraic group. In this case we relate codimension 2a of the support variety of M in nilpotent cone and dimension of M. Namely, we prove that \dim M is `almost' divisible by l^a. Further, we give an a priori estimate for support variety of a module in a given linkage class. We compute the support varieties for Weyl modules. Also we compute the support varieties for tilting modules over quantum SL_n and verify in this case Humphreys' Conjecture which relates support varieties of tilting modules with Lusztig's bijection between nilpotent orbits and two-sided cells in the affine Weyl group.
