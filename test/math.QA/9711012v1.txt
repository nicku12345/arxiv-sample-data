We extend the notion of dually conjugate Hopf (super)algebras to the coloured Hopf (super)algebras {\cal H}^c that we recently introduced. We show that if the standard Hopf (super)algebras {\cal H}_q that are the building blocks of {\cal H}^c have Hopf duals {\cal H}_q^*, then the latter may be used to construct coloured Hopf duals {\cal H}^{c*}, endowed with coloured algebra and antipode maps, but with a standard coalgebraic structure. Next, we review the case where the {\cal H}_q's are quantum universal enveloping algebras of Lie (super)algebras U_q(g), so that the corresponding {\cal H}_q^*'s are quantum (super)groups G_q. We extend the Fronsdal and Galindo universal {\cal T}-matrix formalism to the coloured pairs (U^c(g), G^c) by defining coloured universal {\cal T}-matrices. We then show that together with the coloured universal \cal R-matrices previously introduced, the latter provide an algebraic formulation of the coloured RTT-relations, proposed by Basu-Mallick. This establishes a link between the coloured extensions of Drinfeld-Jimbo and Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan pictures of quantum groups and quantum algebras. Finally, we illustrate the construction of coloured pairs by giving some explicit results for the two-parameter deformations of \bigl(U(gl(2)), Gl(2)\bigr), and \bigl(U(gl(1/1)), Gl(1/1)\bigr).
