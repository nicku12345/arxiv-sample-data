This paper is part II of a series of papers on the deformation quantization on the cotangent bundle of an arbitrary manifold Q. For certain homogeneous star products of Weyl ordered type (which we have obtained from a Fedosov type procedure in part I, see q-alg/9707030) we construct differential operator representations via the formal GNS construction (see q-alg/9607019). The positive linear functional is integration over Q with respect to some fixed density and is shown to yield a reasonable version of the Schr\"odinger representation where a Weyl ordering prescription is incorporated. Furthermore we discuss simple examples like free particle Hamiltonians (defined by a Riemannian metric on Q) and the implementation of certain diffeomorphisms of Q to unitary transformations in the GNS (pre-)Hilbert space and of time reversal maps (involutive anti-symplectic diffeomorphisms of T^*Q) to anti-unitary transformations. We show that the fixed-point set of any involutive time reversal map is either empty or a Lagrangean submanifold. Moreover, we compare our approach to concepts using integral formulas of generalized Moyal-Weyl type. Furthermore we show that the usual WKB expansion with respect to a projectable Lagrangean submanifold can be formulated by a GNS construction. Finally we prove that any homogeneous star product on any cotangent bundle is strongly closed, i. e. the integral over T^*Q w.r.t. the symplectic volume vanishes on star-commutators. An alternative Fedosov type deduction of the star product of standard ordered type using a deformation of the algebra of symmetric contravariant tensor fields is given.
