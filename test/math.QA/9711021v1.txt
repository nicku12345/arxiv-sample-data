Explicit construction of the second order left differential calculi on the quantum group and its subgroups are obtained with the property of the natural reduction: the differential calculus on the quantum group GL_q(2,C) has to contain the 3-dimensional differential calculi on the quantum subgroup SL_q(2,C), the differential calculi on the Borel subgroups B_{L}^{(2)}(C), B_{U}^{(2)}(C) of the lower and of the upper triangular matrices, on the quantum subgroups U_{q}(2), SU_{q}(2), Sp_{q}(2,C), Sp_{q}(2), T_{q}(2,C), B_{L}(C), B_{U}(C), U_{q}(1), Z_{-}^{(2)}(C), Z_{+}^{(2)}(C) and on the their real forms. The classical limit (q\to 1) of the left differential calculus is the nondeformed differential calculus. The differential calculi on the Borel subgroups B_{L}(C), B_{U}(C) of the SL_{q}(2,C) coincide with two solutions of Wess-Zumino differential calculus on the quantum plane C_q(2|0).   The spontaneous breaking symmetry in the WZNW model with SL_{q}(2,R) quantum group symmetry over two-dimensional nondeformed Minkovski space and in the \sigma-models with {SL_{q}(2,R)/U_{p}(1)}, C_{q}(2|0) quantum group symmetry is considered. The Lagrangian formalism over the quantum group manifolds is discussed. The variational calculus on the SL_{q}(2,R) group manifold is obtained. The classical solution of C_{q}(2|0) {\sigma}-model is obtained.
