Let O be the minimal nilpotent adjoint orbit in a classical complex semisimple Lie algebra g. O is a smooth quasi-affine variety stable under the Euler dilation action C^* on g. The algebra of differential operators on O is D(O)=D(Cl(O)) where the closure Cl(O) is a singular cone in g. See \cite{jos} and \cite{bkHam} for some results on the geometry and quantization of O.   We construct an explicit subspace A_{-1}\subset D(O) of commuting differential operators which are Euler homogeneous of degree -1. The space A_{-1} is finite-dimensional, g-stable and carries the adjoint representation. A_{-1} consists of (for g \neq sp(2n,C)) non-obvious order 4 differential operators obtained by quantizing symbols we obtained previously. These operators are "exotic" in that there is (apparently) no geometric or algebraic theory which explains them. The algebra generated by A_{-1} is a maximal commutative subalgebra A of D(X). We find a G-equivariant algebra isomorphism R(O) to A, f\mapsto D_f, such that the formula (f|g)=({constant term of}D_{\bar{g}} f) defines a positive-definite Hermitian inner product on R(O).   We will use these operators D_f to quantize O in a subsequent paper.
