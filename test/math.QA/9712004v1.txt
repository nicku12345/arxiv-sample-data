We study the tensor product V of any number of "elementary" irreducible modules over the Yangian of the general linear Lie algebra. An elementary module is determined by a skew Young diagram and by a complex parameter, and contains a vector called singular. We give sufficient conditions for cyclicity in V of the tensor product of these singular vectors. By using this result, we give an irreducibility criterion for V when each of the skew Young diagrams determining the tensor factors has rectangular shape.
