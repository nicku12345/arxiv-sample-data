The Drinfeld twist is applyed to deforme the rank one orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). The twist element is the same as for the sl(2) Lie algebra due to the embedding of the sl(2) into the superalgebra osp(1|2). The R-matrix has the direct sum structure in the irreducible representations of osp(1|2). The dual quantum group is defined using the FRT-formalism. It includes the Jordanian quantum group SL_\xi(2) as subalgebra and Grassmann generators as well.
