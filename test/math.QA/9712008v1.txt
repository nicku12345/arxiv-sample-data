The q-Legendre polynomials can be treated as some special "functions in the quantum double cosets U(1)\setminus SU_q(2)/U(1)". They form a family (depending on a parameter q) of polynomials in one variable. We get their further generalization by introducing a two parameter family of polynomials. If the former family arises from an algebra which is in a sense "q-commutative", the latter one is related to its noncommutative counterpart. We introduce also a two parameter deformation of the invariant integral on a sphere.
