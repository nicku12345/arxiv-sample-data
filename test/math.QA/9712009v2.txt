The paper is devoted to the symmetry aspects of 2D nonlocal field theory, which is the simplest deformation of the conformally invariant quantum field theory with one free bosonic field. The inverse problem of representation theory is solved for q_R-conformal symmetries, which are infinite dimensional hidden symmetries of the field theory. There is developed a mathematical formalism based on the abstract categorical representation theory and sufficient for applications of symmetry methods to the investigation of processes of synthesis, decay and interaction of quasiparticles in the models of 2D nonlocal quantum field theory.
