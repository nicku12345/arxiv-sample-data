We describe the realization of the super Reshetikhin-Semenov-Tian-Shansky (RS) algebra in quantum affine superalgebras, thus generalizing the approach of Frenkel-Reshetikhin to the supersymmetric (and twisted) case. The algebraic homomorphism between the super RS algebra and the Drinfeld current realization of quantum affine superalgebras is established by using the Gauss decomposition technique of Ding-Frenkel. As an application, we obtain Drinfeld realization of quantum affine superalgebra U_q[osp(1|2)^{(1)}] and its degeneration -- central extended super Yangian double DY_\hbar[osp(1|2)^{(1)}].
