Let \hat{\mathfrak{g}} be an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra, with its Sklyanin-Drinfel'd structure of Lie bialgebra, and let \hat{\mathfrak{h}} be the dual Lie bialgebra. By dualizing the quantum double construction - via formal Hopf algebras - we construct a new quantum group U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{h}}), dual of U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}). Studying its restricted and unrestricted integer forms and their specializations at roots of 1 (in particular, their classical limits), we prove that U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{h}}) yields quantizations of \hat{\mathfrak{h}} and \hat{G}^\infty (the formal group attached to \hat{\mathfrak{g}}), and we construct new quantum Frobenius morphisms. The whole picture extends to the untwisted affine case the results known for quantum groups of finite type.
