A thorough analysis of Lie super-bialgebra structures on Lie super-algebras osp(1|2) and super-e(2) is presented. Combined technique of computer algebraic computations and a subsequent identification of equivalent structures is applied. In all the cases Poisson-Lie brackets on supergroups are found. Possibility of quantizing them in order to obtain quantum groups is discussed. It turns out to be straightforward for all but one structures for super-E(2) group.
