We unify parastatistics, defined as triple operator algebras represented on Fock space, in a simple way using the transition number operators. We express them as a normal ordered expansion of creation and annihilation operators. We discuss several examples of parastatistics, particularly Okubo's and Palev's parastatistics connected to many-body Wigner quantum systems. We relate them to the notion of extended Haldane statistics.
