We study the combinatorics of ad-nilpotent ideals of a Borel subalgebra of sl(n+1,\Bbb C). We provide an inductive method for calculating the class of nilpotence of these ideals and formulas for the number of ideals having a given class of nilpotence. We study the relationships between these results and the combinatorics of Dyck paths, based upon a remarkable bijection between ad-nilpotent ideals and Dyck paths. Finally, we propose a (q,t)-analogue of the Catalan number C_n. These (q,t)-Catalan numbers count on the one hand ad-nilpotent ideals with respect to dimension and class of nilpotence, and on the other hand admit interpretations in terms of natural statistics on Dyck paths.
