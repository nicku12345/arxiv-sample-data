We construct a birational invariant for certain algebraic group actions. We use this invariant to classify linear representations of finite abelian groups up to birational equivalence, thus answering, in a special case, a question of E. B. Vinberg and giving a family of counterexamples to a related conjecture of P. I. Katsylo. We also give a new proof of a theorem of M. Lorenz on birational equivalence of quantum tori (in a slightly expanded form) by applying our invariant in the setting of PGL_n-varieties.
