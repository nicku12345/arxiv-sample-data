Let U(KG) be the group of units of the group ring KG of the group G over a commutative ring K. The anti-automorphism g\mapsto g\m1 of G can be extended linearly to an anti-automorphism a\mapsto a^* of KG. Let S_*(KG)=\{x\in U(KG) \mid x^*=x\} be the set of all symmetric units of U(KG). We consider the following question: for which groups G and commutative rings K it is true that S_*(KG) is a subgroup in U(KG). We answer this question when either a) G is torsion and K is a commutative G-favourable integral domain of characteristic p\geq 0 or b) G is non-torsion nilpotent group and KG is semiprime.
