Let R be a ring with unity and U(R) its group of units. Let \Delta U=\{a\in U(R)\mid [U(R):C_{U(R)}(a)]<\infty\} be the FC-radical of U(R) and let \nabla(R)=\{a\in R\mid [U(R):C_{U(R)}(a)]<\infty\} be the FC-subring of R.   An infinite subgroup H of U(R) is said to be an \omega-subgroup if the left annihilator of each nonzero Lie commmutator [x,y] in R contains only finite number of elements of the form 1-h, where x,y \in R and h\in H. In the case when R is an algebra over a field F, and U(R) contains an \omega-subgroup, we describe its FC-subalgebra and the FC-radical. This paper is an extension of [1].
