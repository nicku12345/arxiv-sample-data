Since the discovery of quantum groups (Drinfeld, Jimbo) and finite dimensional variations thereof (Lusztig, Manin), these objects were studied from different points of view and had many applications. The present paper is part of a series where we intend to show that important classes of Hopf algebras are quantum groups and therefore belong to Lie theory. One of our main results is the explicit construction of a general family of pointed Hopf algebras from Dynkin diagrams. All the Frobenius-Lusztig kernels and their parabolic subalgebras belong to this family, but in addition we get many new examples. We show that any finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebra with group of prime exponent (greater than 17) is indeed in this family. An important step in the proof follows from a another result, where we show that a wide family of finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras is generated by group-like and skew-primitive elements, giving additional support to a conjecture in our previous paper "Finite quantum groups and Cartan matrices", Adv. Math. 154 (2000), 1--45.
