The Orlik-Solomon algebra {\cal A}(G) of a matroid G is the free exterior algebra on the points, modulo the ideal generated by the circuit boundaries. On one hand, this algebra is a homotopy invariant of the complement of any complex hyperplane arrangement realizing G. On the other hand, some features of the matroid G are reflected in the algebraic structure of {\cal A}(G).   In this mostly expository article, we describe recent developments in the construction of algebraic invariants of {\cal A}(G). We develop a categorical framework for the statement and proof of recently discovered isomorphism theorems which suggests a possible setting for classification theorems. Several specific open problems are formulated.
