The elaboration of new quantization methods has recently developed the interest in the study of subalgebras of the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields over a Euclidean space. In this framework, these subalgebras define maximal equivariance conditions that one can impose on a linear bijection between observables that are polynomial in the momenta and differential operators.Here, we determine which finite dimensional graded Lie subalgebras are maximal. In order to characterize these, we make use of results of Guillemin, Singer and Sternberg and Kobayashi and Nagano.
