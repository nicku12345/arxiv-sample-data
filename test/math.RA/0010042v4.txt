The universal enveloping algebra U(g) of a Lie algebra g acts on its representation ring R through D(R), the ring of differential operators on R. A quantised universal enveloping algebra (or "quantum group") is a deformation of a universal enveloping algebra and acts not through the differential operators of its representation ring but through the quantised differential operators of its representation ring. We present this situation for the quantum group of sl_2.
