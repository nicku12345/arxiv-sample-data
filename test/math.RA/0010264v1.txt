We give a new proof that there are arbitrarily large indecomposable abelian groups; moreover, the groups constructed are absolutely indecomposable, that is, they remain indecomposable in any generic extension. However, any absolutely rigid family of groups has cardinality less than the partition cardinal kappa(omega).
