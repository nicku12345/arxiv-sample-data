The two main theorems proved here are as follows: If A is a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field, the identity component of the algebraic group of outer automorphisms of A is invariant under derived equivalence. This invariance is obtained as a consequence of the following generalization of a result of Voigt. Namely, given an appropriate geometrization \text{Comp}^A_{\bold d} of the family of finite A-module complexes with fixed sequence \bold d of dimensions and an ``almost projective'' complex X\in \text{Comp}^A_{\bold d}, there exists a canonical vector space embedding T_{X}(\text{Comp}^A_{\bold d}) / T_{X}(G.X) \ \longrightarrow \text{Hom}_{D^b (A\text{-Mod})}(X, X[1]), where G is the pertinent product of general linear groups acting on \text{Comp}^A_{\bold d}, tangent spaces at X are denoted by T_X(-), and X is identified with its image in the derived category D^b (A\text{-Mod}).
