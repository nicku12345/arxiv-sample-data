M. Kapranov introduced and studied in math.AG/9802041 the noncommutative formal structure of a smooth affine variety. In this note we show that his construction is a special case of microlocalization and extend it in a functorial way to representation schemes of affine algebras. We describe the formal completion in the case of path algebras of quivers and initiate the study of their finite dimensional representations.
