Let G be a simple graph on d vertices. We define a monomial ideal K in the Stanley-Reisner ring A of the order complex of the Boolean algebra on d atoms. The monomials in K are in one-to-one correspondence with the proper colorings of G. In particular, the Hilbert polynomial of K equals the chromatic polynomial of G.   The ideal K is generated by square-free monomials, so A/K is the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex C. The h-vector of C is a certain transformation of the tail T(n)= n^d-k(n) of the chromatic polynomial k of G. The combinatorial structure of the complex C is described explicitly and it is shown that the Euler characteristic of C equals the number of acyclic orientations of G.
