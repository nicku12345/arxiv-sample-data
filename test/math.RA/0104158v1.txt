Almkvist proved that for a commutative ring A the characteristic polynomial of an endomorphism \alpha:P \to P of a finitely generated projective A-module determines (P,\alpha) up to extensions. For a non-commutative ring A the generalized characteristic polynomial of an endomophism \alpha : P \to P of a finitely generated projective A-module is defined to be the Whitehead torsion [1-x\alpha] \in K_1(A[[x]]), which is an equivalence class of formal power series with constant coefficient 1.   In this paper an example is given of a non-commutative ring A and an endomorphism \alpha:P \to P for which the generalized characteristic polynomial does not determine (P,\alpha) up to extensions. The phenomenon is traced back to the non-injectivity of the natural map \Sigma^{-1}A[x] \to A[[x]], where \Sigma^{-1}A[x] is the Cohn localization of A[x] inverting the set \Sigma of matrices in A[x] sent to an invertible matrix by A[x] \to A; x \mapsto 0.
