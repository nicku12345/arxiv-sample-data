Let A, B be multidimensional matrices of boundary format respectively \prod_{i=0}^p(k_i+1), \prod_{j=0}^q(l_j+1). Assume that k_p=l_0 so that the convolution A\ast B is defined. We prove that Det (A\ast B)=Det(A)^{\alpha}\cdot Det(B)^{\beta} where \alpha= \frac {l_0!}{l_1!... l_q!}, \beta=\frac {(k_0+1)!}{k_1! ... k_{p-1}!(k_p+1)!} and Det is the hyperdeterminant. When A, B are square matrices this formula is the usual Binet-Cauchy Theorem computing the determinant of the product A\cdot B. It follows that A \ast B is nondegenerate if and only if A and B are both nondegenerate. We show by a counterexample that the assumption of boundary format cannot be dropped.
