A conjecture of Kac states that the polynomial counting the number of absolutely indecomposable representations of a quiver over a finite field with given dimension vector has positive coefficients and furthermore that its constant term is equal to the multiplicity of the corresponding root in the associated Kac-Moody Lie algebra. In this paper we prove these conjectures for indivisible dimension vectors.
