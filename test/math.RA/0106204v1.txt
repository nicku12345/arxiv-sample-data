We consider transformations preserving certain linear structure in Grassmannians and give some generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry and the Chow Theorem [Ch]. It will be exploited to study linear (k,n-k)-involutions, 1<k<n-1. The analogy of the well-known J. Dieudonn\'{e} and C. E. Rickart result will be obtained.
