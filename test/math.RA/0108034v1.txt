We give a Clifford correspondence for an algebra A over an algebraically closed field, that is an algorithm for constructing some finite-dimensional simple A-modules from simple modules for a subalgebra and endomorphism algebras. This applies to all finite-dimensional simple A-modules in the case that A is finite-dimensional and semisimple with a given semisimple subalgebra. We discuss connections between our work and earlier results, with a view towards applications particularly to finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebras.
