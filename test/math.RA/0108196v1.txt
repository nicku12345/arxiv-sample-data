We consider a distance-regular graph \G with diameter d \ge 3 and eigenvalues k=\theta_0>\theta_1>... >\theta_d. We show the intersection numbers a_1, b_1 satisfy  (\theta_1 + {k \over a_1+1}) (\theta_d + {k \over a_1+1}) \ge - {ka_1b_1 \over (a_1+1)^2}.  We say \G is {\it tight} whenever \G is not bipartite, and equality holds above. We characterize the tight property in a number of ways. For example, we show \G is tight if and only if the intersection numbers are given by certain rational expressions involving d independent parameters. We show \G is tight if and only if a_1\not=0, a_d=0, and \G is 1-homogeneous in the sense of Nomura. We show \G is tight if and only if each local graph is connected strongly-regular, with nontrivial eigenvalues -1-b_1(1+\theta_1)^{-1} and -1-b_1(1+\theta_d)^{-1}. Three infinite families and nine sporadic examples of tight distance-regular graphs are given.
