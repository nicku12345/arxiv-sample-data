Let D(H) be the quantum double associated to a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra H. In this note, we first generalize a result of Majid, stating that a finite dimensional Hopf algebra H is quasitriangular if and only if there is a projection of the quantum double D(H) onto H covering the natural inclusion.We then prove that the quantum double of a finite dimensional quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra is a biproduct.
