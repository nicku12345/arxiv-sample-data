We propound the thesis that there is a limitation to the number of possible structures which are axiomatically endowed with identities involving operations. In the case of algebras with a binary operation satisfying a formally reducible (to be explained) identity between two n-iterates of the operation, it is established that the frequency of such algebras goes to zero as n tends to infinity. This is proved by a suitable ordering and labeling of the expressions (words) of the corresponding free algebra and the formation of a series of tableaux whose entries are the labels. The tableaux reveal surprising symmetry properties, stated in terms of the Catalan numbers and their partitions. As a result of the defining identity and the tableaux all iterates of order higher than n fall into equivalence classes of semantically equal ones. Classnumbers depending on the tableaux are calculated for all algebras of order n = 3 (and partially for n = 4). Certain classnumbers are invariants in the sense that for algebras of same order they are equal. Algebras with several operations of any arity are considered. A generalization of Catalan numbers depending on homorphisms of the structure is proposed and corresponding generating functions set up. As an example of this, a kind of skein polynomials are constructed characterizing the formal build-up of iterates. As no distinction is made between the various algebras, isomorphic or not, which are models of the identity the results can also be formulated in terms of varieties with signature the identity in question.
