We show that string algebras are `homologically tame' in the following sense: First, the syzygies of arbitrary representations of a finite dimensional string algebra \Lambda are direct sums of cyclic representations, and the left finitistic dimensions, both little and big, of \Lambda can be computed from a finite set of cyclic left ideals contained in the Jacobson radical. Second, our main result shows that the functorial finiteness status of the full subcategory \Cal P consisting of the finitely generated left \Lambda-modules of finite projective dimension is completely determined by a finite number of, possibly infinite dimensional, string modules -- one for each simple \Lambda-module -- which are algorithmically constructible from quiver and relations of \Lambda. Namely, \Cal P is contravariantly finite in \Lambda-mod precisely when all of these string modules are finite dimensional, in which case they coincide with the minimal \Cal P-approximations of the corresponding simple modules. Yet, even when \Cal P fails to be contravariantly finite, these `characteristic' string modules encode, in an accessible format, all desirable homological information about \Lambda-mod.
