In formulating a generalized framework to study certain noncommutative algebras naturally arising in representation theory, K. A. Brown asked if every finitely generated Hopf algebra satisfying a polynomial identity was finite over a normal commutative Hopf subalgebra. In this note we show that Radford's biproduct, applied to the enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra pl(1,1), provides a noetherian prime counterexample.
