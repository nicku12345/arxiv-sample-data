Let G be a finitely generated abelian-by-finite group and k a field of characteristic p\ge 0. The Euler class [k_G] of G over k is the class of the trivial kG-module in the Grothendieck group G_0(kG). We show that [k_G] has finite order if and only if every p-regular element of G has infinite centralizer in G. We also give a lower bound for the order of the Euler class in terms of suitable finite subgroups of G. This lower bound is derived from a more general result on finite-dimensional representations of smash products of Hopf algebras.
