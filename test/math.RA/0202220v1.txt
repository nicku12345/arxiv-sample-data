We obtain a characterization of the real Lie algebras admitting abelian complex structures in terms of certain affine Lie algebras \frak a \frak f \frak f (A), where A is a commutative algebra. These affine Lie algebras are natural generalizations of \frak a \frak f \frak f (\Bbb C) and the corresponding Lie groups are complex affine manifolds. It turns out that all 4-dimensional Lie algebras carrying abelian complex structures are central extensions of such affine Lie algebras.
