Results describing Lie ideals and maximal finite-codimensional Lie subalgebras of the Lie algebras associated with Lie algebroids with non-singular anchor maps are presented. It is also proved that every isomorphism of such Lie algebras induces a diffeomorphism of base manifolds respecting the generalized foliations defined by the anchor maps.
