We study the cohomology H^*_{\lambda \omega}(G/\Gamma, {\mathbb C}) of the deRham complex \Lambda^*(G/\Gamma)\otimes{\mathbb C} of a compact solvmanifold G/\Gamma with a deformed differential d_{\lambda \omega}=d + \lambda\omega, where \omega is a closed 1-form. This cohomology naturally arises in the Morse-Novikov theory. We show that for a solvable Lie group G with a completely solvable Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} and a cocompact lattice \Gamma \subset G the cohomology H^*_{\lambda \omega}(G/\Gamma, {\mathbb C}) coincides with the cohomology H^*_{\lambda \omega}(\mathfrak{g}) of the Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} associated with the one-dimensional representation \rho_{\lambda \omega}: \mathfrak{g} \to {\mathbb K}, \rho_{\lambda \omega}(\xi) = \lambda \omega(\xi). Moreover H^*_{\lambda \omega}(G/\Gamma, {\mathbb C}) is non-trivial if and only if -\lambda [\omega] belongs to the finite subset \{0\} \cup \tilde \Omega_{\mathfrak{g}} in H^1(G/\Gamma, {\mathbb C}) well defined in terms of \mathfrak{g}.
