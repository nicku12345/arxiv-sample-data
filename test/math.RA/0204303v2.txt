Two classical results of Stafford say that every (left) ideal of the n-th Weyl algebra A_n can be generated by two elements, and every holonomic A_n-module is cyclic, i.e. generated by one element. We modify Stafford's original proofs to make the algorithmic computation of these generators possible.
