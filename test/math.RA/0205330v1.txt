We consider the generic Green conjecture on syzygies of a canonical curve, and particularly the following reformulation thereof: {\it For a smooth projective curve C of genus g in characteristic 0, the condition {\rm Cliff} C>l is equivalent to the fact that K_{g-l'-2,1}(C,K_C)=0, \forall l'\leq l.} We propose a new approach, which allows up to prove this result for generic curves C of genus g(C) and gonality {\rm gon(C)} in the range \frac{g(C)}{3}+1\leq {\rm gon(C)}\leq\frac{g(C)}{2}+1.
