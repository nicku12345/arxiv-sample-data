We give a detailed proof of Theorem 1.15 from a well-known paper "Primitive normal bases for finite fields" by H.W. Lenstra Jr. and R.J. Schoof. We are not aware of any other proofs. Let L/K be a finite-dimensional Galois field extension and B the set of all normal bases of this extension. Theorem 1.15 describes the group of all \gamma in the multiplicative group of L such that \gamma B = B.
