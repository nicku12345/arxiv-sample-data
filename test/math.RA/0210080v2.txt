Suppose X is a smooth projective scheme of finite type over a field K, \mathcal{E} is a locally free {\mathcal{O}}_{X}-bimodule of rank 2, \mathcal{A} is the non-commutative symmetric algebra generated by \mathcal{E} and {\sf Proj}\A is the corresponding non-commutative \mathbb{P}^{1}-bundle. We use the properties of the internal \operatorname{Hom} functor \HU(-,-) to prove versions of Serre finiteness and Serre vanishing for {\sf Proj}\A. As a corollary to Serre finiteness, we prove that {\sf Proj}\A is Ext-finite. This fact is used in \cite{izu} to prove that if X is a smooth curve over \operatorname{Spec}K, {\sf Proj }\A has a Riemann-Roch theorem and an adjunction formula.
