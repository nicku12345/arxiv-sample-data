A sequential effect algebra (SEA) is an effect algebra on which a sequential product is defined. We present examples of effect algebras that admit a unique, many and no sequential product. Some general theorems concerning unique sequential products are proved. We discuss sequentially ordered SEA's in which the order is completely determined by the sequential product. It is demonstrated that intervals in a sequential ordered SEA admit a sequential product.
