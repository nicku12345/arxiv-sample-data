Let H be a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra over a field k and {\mathfrak A} a right H-comodule algebra in the sense of Hausser and Nill. We first show that on the k-vector space {\mathfrak A}\ot H^* we can define an algebra structure, denoted by {\mathfrak A}\ovsm H^*, in the monoidal category of left H-modules (i.e. {\mathfrak A}\ovsm H^* is an H-module algebra. Then we will prove that the category of two-sided ({\mathfrak A}, H)-bimodules \hba  is isomorphic to the category of relative ({\mathfrak A}\ovsm H^*, H^*)-Hopf modules, as introduced in by Hausser and Nill. In the particular case where {\mathfrak A}=H, we will obtain a result announced by Nill. We will also introduce the categories of Doi-Hopf modules and two-sided two-cosided Hopf modules and we will show that they are in certain situations isomorphic to module categories.
