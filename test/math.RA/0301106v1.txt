We construct new examples of non-nil algebras with any number of generators, which are direct sums of two locally nilpotent subalgebras. As all previously known examples, our examples are contracted semigroup algebras and the underlying semigroups are unions of locally nilpotent subsemigroups. In our constructions we make more transparent than in the past the close relationship between the considered problem and combinatorics of words.
