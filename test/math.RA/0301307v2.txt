We characterize the relationship between the singular values of a complex Hermitian (resp., real symmetric, complex symmetric) matrix and the singular values of its off-diagonal block. We also characterize the eigenvalues of an Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrix C=A+B in terms of the combined list of eigenvalues of A and B. The answers are given by Horn-type linear inequalities. The proofs depend on a new inequality among Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
