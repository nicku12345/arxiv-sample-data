In this note we extend duality theorems for crossed products obtained by M. Koppinen and C. Chen from the case of a base field or a Dedekind domain to the case of an arbitrary noetherian commutative ground ring under fairly weak conditions. In particular we extend an improved version of the celebrated Blattner-Montgomery duality theorem to the case of arbitrary noetherian ground rings.
