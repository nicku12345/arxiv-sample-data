In this note we study Morita contexts and Galois extensions for corings. For a coring \QTR{cal}{C} over a (not necessarily commutative) ground ring A we give equivalent conditions for \QTR{cal}{M}^{\QTR{cal}{C}} to satisfy the weak. resp. the strong structure theorem. We also characterize the so called \QTR{em}{cleft}C\QTR{em}{-Galois extensions} over commutative rings. Our approach is similar to that of Y. Doi and A. Masuoka in their work on (cleft) H-Galois extensions.
