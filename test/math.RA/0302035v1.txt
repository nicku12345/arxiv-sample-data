A general method is developed for deriving Quantum First and Second Fundamental Theorems of Coinvariant Theory from classical analogs in Invariant Theory, in the case that the quantization parameter q is transcendental over a base field. Several examples are given illustrating the utility of the method; these recover earlier results of various researchers including Domokos, Fioresi, Hacon, Rigal, Strickland, and the present authors.
