We give the description of the t-structure on the derived category of regular holonomic D-modules corresponding to the trivial t-structure on the derived category of constructible sheaves via Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. We give also the condition for a decreasing sequence of families of supports to give a t-structure on the derived category of coherent O-modules.
