We show the existence of a unital subalgebra of the symmetric group algebra linearly spanned by sums of permutations with a common peak set, which we call the peak algebra. We show that this algebra is the image of the descent algebra of type B under the map to the descent algebra of type A which forgets the signs, and also the image of the descent algebra of type D. The peak algebra contains a two sided ideal which is defined in terms of interior peaks. This object was introduced in previous work by Nyman; we find that it is the image of certain ideals of the descent algebras of types B and D introduced in previous work of N. Bergeron et al. We derive an exact sequence involving the peak ideal and the peak algebras of degrees n and n-2. We obtain this and many other properties of the peak algebra and its peak ideal by first establishing analogous results for signed permutations and then forgetting the signs. In particular, we construct two new commutative semisimple subalgebras of the descent algebra by grouping permutations according to their number of peaks or interior peaks. We discuss the Hopf algebraic structures that exist on the direct sums of these spaces over n\geq 0 and explain the connection with previous work of Stembridge; we also obtain new properties of his descents-to-peaks map and construct a type B analog.
