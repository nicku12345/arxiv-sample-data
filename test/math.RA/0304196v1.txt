To a formally smooth algebra A we associate a quiver setting (Q,a) containing enough information to reconstruct all the local quiver settings determining the etale local structure of finite dimensional representation schemes of A, see math.AG/9904171. Conjecturally, in a (yet to be developed) non-commutative etale topology, A is locally isomorphic to an algebra B which in turn is Morita equivalent (via the dimension vector a) to the path algebra CQ of the quiver Q.
