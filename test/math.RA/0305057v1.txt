We study symplectic structures on filiform Lie algebras -- nilpotent Lie algebras of the maximal length of the descending central sequence. In the present article we classify the Lie algebras with the structure relations of the following form: [e_i,e_j]=(j-i)e_{i+j}+\sum_{l{=}1}c_{ij}^l e_{i+j+l}, i+j \le n. In even dimensions the subspace of symplectic Lie algebras has the codimension one.
