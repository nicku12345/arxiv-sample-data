Let K denote a field and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A:V\to V and A^*:V\to V which satisfy the following two properties:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a Leonard pair on V. Referring to the above Leonard pair, we show there exists a sequence of scalars \beta,\gamma,\gamma^*, \varrho,\varrho^*,\omega, \eta, \eta^* taken from K such that both (i) A^2 A^*-\beta A A^*A+A^*A^2-\gamma (AA^*+A^*A) -\varrho A^* =\gamma^*A^2+\omega A+\etaI;   (ii) A^{*2}A-\beta A^*AA^*+AA^{*2}-\gamma^*(A^*A+AA^*) -\varrho^*A =\gamma A^{*2}+\omega A^*+\eta^*I.   The sequence is uniquely determined by the Leonard pair provided the dimension of V is at least 4. The equations above are called the Askey-Wilson relations.
