We introduce a new concept of mixed representations of quivers that is a generalization of ordinary representations of quivers and orthogonal (symplectic) representations of symmetric quivers introduced recently by Derksen and Weyman. We describe the generating invariants of mixed representations of quivers (First Fundamental Theorem) and prove additional results that allow us to describe the defining relations between them in the second article.
