Non-commutative Hilbert schemes, introduced by M. V. Nori, parametrize left ideals of finite codimension in free algebras. More generally, parameter spaces of finite codimensional submodules of free modules over free algebras are considered. Cell decompositions of these varieties are constructed, whose cells are parametrized by certain types of forests. Asymptotics for the corresponding Poincare polynomials and properties of their generating functions are discussed.
