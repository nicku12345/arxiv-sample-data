Let K denote a field and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A:V\to V and A^*:V\to V that satisfy conditions (i), (ii) below.   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is diagonal and the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal.   We call such a pair a Leonard pair on V. We give an overview of the theory of Leonard pairs.
