The so called induction functors appear in several areas of Algebra in different forms. Interesting examples are the induction functors in the Theory of Affine Algebraic groups. In this note we investigate the so called Hopf pairings (bialgebra pairings) and use them to study induction functors for affine group schemes over arbitrary commutative ground rings. We present also a special type of Hopf pairings (bialgebra pairings), satisfying the so called \alpha -condition. For those pairings the induction functor is studied and a nice description of it is obtained. Along the paper several interesting results are generalized from the case of base fields to the case of arbitrary commutative (noetherian) ground rings.
