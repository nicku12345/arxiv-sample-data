We study the possible dimension vectors of indecomposable parabolic bundles on the projective line, and use our answer to solve the problem of characterizing those collections of conjugacy classes of n by n matrices for which one can find matrices in their closures whose product is equal to the identity matrix. Both answers depend on the root system of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra. Our proofs use Ringel's theory of tubular algebras, work of Mihai on the existence of logarithmic connections, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and an algebraic version, due to Dettweiler and Reiter, of Katz's middle convolution operation.
