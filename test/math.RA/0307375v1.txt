We study existence of complex structures on semidirect products \g \oplus_{\rho} \v where \g is a real Lie algebra and \rho is a representation of \g on \v. Our first examples, the Euclidean algebra \e(3) and the Poincar\'e algebra  \e(2,1), carry complex structures obtained by deformation of a regular complex structure on \sl (2, \c). We also exhibit a complex structure on the Galilean algebra \G(3,1). We construct next a complex structure on \g \oplus_{\rho} \v starting with one on \g under certain compatibility assumptions on \rho.   As an application of our results we obtain that there exists k\in \{0,1\} such that (S^1)^k \times E(n) admits a left invariant complex structure, where S^1 is the circle and E(n) denotes the Euclidean group. We also prove that the Poincar\'e group P^{4k+3} has a natural left invariant complex structure.   In case \dim \g= \dim \v, then there is an adapted complex structure on \g\oplus_{\rho} \v precisely when \rho determines a flat, torsion-free connection on \g. If \rho is self-dual, \g \oplus_{\rho}\v carries a natural symplectic structure as well. If, moreover, \rho comes from a metric connection then \g\oplus_{\rho} \v possesses a pseudo-K\"ahler structure.   We prove that the tangent bundle TG of a Lie group G carrying a flat torsion free connection \nabla and a parallel complex structure possesses a hypercomplex structure. More generally, by an iterative procedure, we can obtain Lie groups carrying a family of left invariant complex structures which generate any prescribed real Clifford algebra.
