Let H be an infinite-dimensional braided Hopf algebra and assume that the braiding is symmetric on H and its quasi-dual H^d. We prove the Blattner-Montgomery duality theorem, namely we prove  (R # H)# H^{d} \cong R \otimes (H # H^{d}) \hbox {as algebras in braided tensor category} {\cal C}. In particular, we present two duality theorems for infinite braided Hopf algebras in the Yetter-Drinfeld module category.
