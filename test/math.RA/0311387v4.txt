We introduce and discuss a definition of approximation of a topological algebraic system A by finite algebraic systems of some class \K. For the case of a discrete algebraic system this definition is equivalent to the well-known definition of a local embedding of an algebraic system A in a class \K of algebraic systems. According to this definition A is locally embedded in K iff it is a subsystem of an ultraproduct of some systems in \K. We obtain a similar characterization of approximation of a locally compact system A by systems in \K.   We inroduce the bounded formulas of the signature of A and their approximations similar to those introduced by C.W.Henson \cite{he} for Banach spaces. We prove that a positive bounded formula \f holds in A if all precise enough approximations of \f hold in all precise enough approximations of A.   We prove that a locally compact field cannot be approximated by finite associative rings (not necessary commutative). Finite approximations of the field \R can be concedered as computer systems for reals. Thus, it is impossible to construct a computer arithmetic for reals that is an associative ring.
