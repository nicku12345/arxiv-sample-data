Let f_1 and f_2 be two semi-universal deformations of quasi homogeneous polynomials in two variables respectively for the weight vectors \rho_1 and \rho_2 such that they satisfy similar conditions to that of semi quasi homogeneous singularities for one weight. By methods inspired by H. Maynadier's, we give an explicit formula for a Bernstein-Sato polynomial involving two affine forms \rho_i(f_1) s_1 + \rho_i(f_2) s_2 +k, i=1,2. In the particular case (f_1, f_2)=(x_1^a+x_2^b, x_1^c+x_2^d), we calculate the space \mathcal{H}_f recently studied by J. Brian\c{c}on, Ph. Maisonobe and M. Merle and we show that it is equal to the zero set of s_1 s_2 (ab s_1+ ad s_2)(ad s_1+ cd s_2).
