It is shown that all strongly symmetric elements are solutions of constant classical Yang-Baxter equation in Lie algebra, or of quantum Yang-Baxter equation in algebra. Otherwise, all solutions of constant classical Yang-Baxter equation (CYBE) in Lie algebra L with dim L \le 3 over field k of characteristic 2 are obtained
