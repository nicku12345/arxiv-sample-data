We construct the H-von Neumann regular radical for H-module algebras and show that it is an H-radical property. We obtain that the Jacobson radical of twisted graded algebra is a graded ideal. For twisted H-module algebra R, we also show that r_{j}(R#_\sigma H)= r_{Hj}(R)#_\sigma H and the Jacobson radical of R is stable, when k is an algebraically closed field or there exists an algebraic closure F of k such that r_j(R \otimes F) = r_j(R) \otimes F, where H is a finite-dimensional, semisimple, cosemisimple, commutative or cocommutative Hopf algebra over k. In particular, we answer two questions J.R.Fisher asked.
