T. Shudo and H. Miyamito \cite{SM78} showed that C can be decomposed into a direct sum of its indecomposable subcoalgebras of C.   Y.H. Xu \cite {XF92} showed that the decomposition was unique. He also showed that M can uniquely be decomposed into a direct sum of the weak-closed indecomposable subcomodules of M(we call the decomposition the weak-closed indecomposable decomposition) in \cite{XSF94}. In this paper, we give the relation between the two decomposition. We show that if M is a full, W-relational hereditary C-comodule, then the following conclusions hold: (1) M is indecomposable iff C is indecomposable; (2) M is relative-irreducible iff C is irreducible; (3) M can be decomposed into a direct sum of its weak-closed relative-irreducible subcomodules iff C can be decomposed into a direct sum of its irreducible subcoalgebras. We also obtain the relation between coradical of C- comodule M and radical of algebra C(M)^*
