We introduce the quiver of a bicomodule over a cosemisimple coalgebra. Applying this to the coradical C_0 of an arbitrary coalgebra C, we give an alternative definition of the Gabriel quiver of C, and then show that it coincides with the known \operatorname {Ext} quiver of C and the link quiver of C. The dual Gabriel theorem for a coalgebra with separable coradical is obtained, which generalizes the corresponding result for a pointed coalgebra. We also give a new description of C_1 of any coalgebra C, which can be regarded as a generalization of the first part of the well-known Taft-Wilson Theorem for pointed coalgebras. As applications, we give a characterization of locally finite coalgebras via their Gabriel quivers, and a property of the Gabriel quiver of a quasi-coFrobenius coalgebra.
