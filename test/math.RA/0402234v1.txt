It is the aim of this work to study product structures on four dimensional solvable Lie algebras. We determine all possible paracomplex structures and consider the case when one of the subalgebras is an ideal. These results are applied to the case of Manin triples and complex product structures. We also analyze the three dimensional subalgebras.
