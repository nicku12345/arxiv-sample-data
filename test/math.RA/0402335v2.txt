We construct a certain topological algebra \Ext ^{\sharp}_{G ^{\vee}} X (\chi) from a Deligne-Langlands parameter space X (\chi) attached to the group of rational points of a connected split reductive algebraic group G over a non-Archimedean local field \mathbb K. Then we prove the equivalence between the category of continuous modules of \Ext ^{\sharp}_{G ^{\vee}} X (\chi) and the category of unramified admissible modules of G (\mathbb K) with a generalized infinitesimal character corresponding to \chi. This is an analogue of Soergel's conjecture which concerns the real reductive setting.
