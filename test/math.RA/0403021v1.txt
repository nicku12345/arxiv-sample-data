We study quantum analogues of quotient varieties, namely quantum grassmannians and quantum determinantal rings, from the point of view of regularity conditions. More precisely, we show that these rings are AS-Cohen-Macaulay and determine which of them are AS-Gorenstein. Our method is inspired by the one developed by De Concini, Eisenbud and Procesi in the commutative case. Thus, we introduce and study the notion of a quantum graded algebra with a staightening law on a partially ordered set, showing in particular that, among such algebras, those whose underlying poset is wonderful are AS-Cohen-Macaulay. Then, we prove that both quantum grassmannians and quantum determinantal rings are quantum graded algebras with a staightening law on a wonderful poset, hence showing that they are AS-Cohen-Macaulay. In this last step, we are lead to introduce and study (to some extent) natural quantum analogues of Schubert varieties.
