Is tame open? No answer so far. One may pose the Tame-Open Conjecture: Tame is open. But how to support it? No effective way to date. In this note, the rank of a wild algebra is introduced. The Wild-Rank Conjecture, which implies the Tame-Open Conjecture, is formulated. The Wild-Rank Conjecture is improved to the Basic-Wild-Rank Conjecture. A covering criterion on the rank of a basic wild algebra is given, which can be effectively applied to verify the Basic-Wild-Rank Conjecture for concrete algebras. It makes all conjectures much reliable.
