The injective right comodules appearing in the minimal injective resolution of a finite-dimensional comodule need not to be of finite dimension or even quasi-finite. The obstruction here is that factor comodules of quasi-finite comodules are not in general quasi-finite. This note is mainly devoted to the study of coalgebras for which the class of all quasi-finite right comodules is closed under factor comodules. A major tool here is the local study, in the sense of abstract localization, of the comodules which have all their factors quasi-finite.
