We classify the orbits of coquasi-triangular structures for the Hopf algebra E(n) under the action of lazy cocycles and the Hopf automorphism group. This is applied to detect subgroups of the Brauer group BQ(k,E(n)) of E(n) that are isomorphic. For a triangular structure R on E(n) we prove that the subgroup BM(k,E(n),R) of BQ(k,E(n)) arising from R is isomorphic to a direct product of BW(k), the Brauer-Wall group of the ground field k, and Sym_n(k), the group of n \times n symmetric matrices under addition. For a general quasi-triangular structure R' on E(n) we construct a split short exact sequence having BM(k,E(n), R') as a middle term and as a left term a central extension of the group of symmetric matrices of order r<n (r depending on R'). We finally describe how the image of the Hopf automorphism group inside BQ(k,E(n)) acts on Sym_n(k).
