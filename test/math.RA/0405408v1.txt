The Hopf order of an element h of a Hopf algebra H is the least n such that the n-th Hopf power of h is trivial. For some bismash product Hopf algebras obtained from factorizable groups (including Drinfeld doubles of some groups) we compute the dimensions of the spaces of elements with trivial n-th Hopf powers, and determine which Hopf orders of elements are possible. We discuss the behavior under twists and duality.
