We define and study a notion of Gorenstein projective dimension for complexes of left modules over associative rings. For complexes of finite Gorenstein projective dimension we define and study a Tate cohomology theory. Tate cohomology groups have a natural transformation to classical Ext groups. In the case of module arguments, we show that these maps fit into a long exact sequence, where every third term is a relative cohomology group defined for left modules of finite Gorenstein projective dimension.
