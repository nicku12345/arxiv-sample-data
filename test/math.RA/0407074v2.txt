We study P-Hopf algebras with one coassociative cooperation over different operads P. For example, we consider the Loday-Ronco dendriform Hopf algebra and its isomorphisms with the noncommutative planar Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and with a Hopf algebra of Brouder and Frabetti. We focus on Hopf algebra structures over free operads, like the operad Mag freely generated by a non-commutative non-associative binary operation, and the operad of Stasheff polytopes.   In order to describe the operads of primitive elements we prove an analogon of the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. We determine the generating series for these operads and show that the dimension of PrimMag(n) is related to the log-Catalan numbers. By a recursive method we show how, for small n, these spaces can be described as modules over the symmetric groups.
