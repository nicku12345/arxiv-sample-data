We study relations between finite-dimensional representations of color Lie algebras and their cocycle twists. Main tools are the universal enveloping algebras and their FCR-properties (finite-dimensional representations are completely reducible.) Cocycle twist preserves the FCR-property. As an application, we compute all finite dimensional representations (up to isomorphism) of the color Lie algebra sl_2^c.
