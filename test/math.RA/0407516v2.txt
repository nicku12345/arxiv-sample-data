Let H_c be the rational Cherednik algebra of type A_{n-1} with spherical subalgebra U_c = eH_ce. Then U_c is filtered by order of differential operators, with associated graded ring gr U_c = C[h+h*]^W, where W is the n-th symmetric group. We construct a filtered Z-algebra B such that, under mild conditions on c:   (1) The category B-qgr of graded noetherian B-modules modulo torsion is equivalent to U_c-mod;   (2) The associated graded Z-algebra gr(B) has gr(B)-qgr equivalent to Coh Hilb(n), the category of coherent sheaves on the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane.   This can be regarded as saying that U_c simultaneously gives a noncommutative deformation both of (h+h*)/W and of its resolution of singularities Hilb(n) --> (h+h*)/W. As our forthcoming companion paper [GS] shows, this result is a powerful tool for studying the representation theory of H_c and its relationship to Hilb(n).
