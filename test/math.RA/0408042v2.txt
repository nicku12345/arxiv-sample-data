To a B-coring and a (B,A)-bimodule that is finitely generated and projective as a right A-module an A-coring is associated. This new coring is termed a base ring extension of a coring by a module. We study how the properties of a bimodule such as separability and the Frobenius properties are reflected in the induced base ring extension coring. Any bimodule that is finitely generated and projective on one side, together with a map of corings over the same base ring, lead to the notion of a module-morphism, which extends the notion of a morphism of corings (over different base rings). A module-morphism of corings induces functors between the categories of comodules.   These functors are termed pull-back and push-out functors respectively and thus relate categories of comodules of different corings. We study when the pull-back functor is fully faithful and when it is an equivalence. A generalised descent associated to a morphism of corings is introduced.   We define a category of module-morphisms, and show that push-out functors are naturally isomorphic to each other if and only if the corresponding module-morphisms are mutually isomorphic. All these topics are studied within a unifying language of bicategories and the extensive use is made of interpretation of corings as comonads in the bicategory Bim of bimodules and module-morphisms as 1-cells in the associated bicategories of comonads in Bim.
