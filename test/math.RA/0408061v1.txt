This paper begins by introducing the concept of a quasi-hom-Lie algebra which is a natural generalization of hom-Lie algebras introduced in a previous paper by the authors. Quasi-hom-Lie algebras include also as special cases (color) Lie algebras and superalgebras, and can be seen as deformations of these by homomorphisms, twisting the Jacobi identity and skew-symmetry. The natural realm for these quasi-hom-Lie algebras is as a generalization-deformation of the Witt algebra \Witt of derivations on the Laurent polynomials \C[t,t^{-1}]. We also develop a theory of central extensions for qhl-algebras which can be used to deform and generalize the Virasoro algebra by centrally extending the deformed Witt type algebras constructed here. In addition, we give a number of other interesting examples of quasi-hom-Lie algebras, among them a deformation of the loop algebra.
