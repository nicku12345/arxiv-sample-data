We study the cyclic module {}_SR for a ring extension A \| B with centralizer R and bimodule endomorphism ring S = End {}_BA_B. We show that if A \| B is an H-separable Hopf subalgebra, then B is a normal Hopf subalgebra of A. We observe from math.RA/0107064 and math.RA/0108067 depth two in the role of noncommutative normality (as in field theory) in a depth two separable Frobenius characterization of irreducible semisimple-Hopf-Galois extensions. We prove that a depth two extension has a Galois A-coring structure on A \o_R T where T is the right R-bialgebroid dual to S.
