Let m, n be positive integers such that m\leq n. We consider all pairs (B,A) where B is a finite dimensional T^n-bounded k[T]-module and A is a submodule of B which is T^m-bounded. They form the objects of the submodule category S_m(k[T]/T^n) which is a Krull-Schmidt category with Auslander-Reiten sequences. The case m=n deals with submodules of k[T]/T^n-modules and has been studied well. In this manuscript we determine the representation type of the categories S_m(k[T]/T^n) also for the cases where m<n: It turns out that there are only finitely many indecomposables in S_m(k[T]/T^n) if either m<3, n<6, or (m,n)=(3,6); the category is tame if (m,n) is one of the pairs (3,7), (4,6), (5,6), or (6,6); otherwise, S_m(k[T]/T^n) has wild representation type. Moreover, in each of the finite or tame cases we describe the indecomposables and picture the Auslander-Reiten quiver.
