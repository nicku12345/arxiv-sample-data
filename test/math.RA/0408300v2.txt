The use of the properties of actions on an algebra to enrich the study of the algebra is well-trodden and still fashionable. Here, the notion and study of endomorphic elements of (Banach) algebras are introduced. This study is initiated, in the hope that it will open up, further, the structure of (Banach) algebras in general, enrich the study of endomorphisms and provide examples.   In particular, here, we use it to classify algebras for the convenience of our study. We also present results on the structure of some classes of endomorphic elements and bring out the contrast with idempotents.
