Among the finitely generated modules over a Noetherian ring R, the semidualizing modules have been singled out due to their particularly nice duality properties. When R is a normal domain, we exhibit a natural inclusion of the set of isomorphism classes of semidualizing R-modules into the divisor class group of R. After a description of the basic properties of this inclusion, it is employed to investigate the structure of the set of isomorphism classes of semidualizing R-modules. In particular, this set is described completely for determinantal rings over normal domains.
