Let \Lambda and \Gamma be left and right noetherian rings and _{\Lambda}U a Wakamatsu tilting module with \Gamma ={\rm End}(_{\Lambda}T). We introduce a new definition of U-dominant dimensions and show that the U-dominant dimensions of _{\Lambda}U and U_{\Gamma} are identical. We characterize k-Gorenstein modules in terms of homological dimensions and the property of double homological functors preserving monomorphisms. We also study a generalization of k-Gorenstein modules, and characterize it in terms of some similar properties of k-Gorenstein modules.
