In this paper we mainly study the homological properties of dual modules over k-Gorenstein rings. For a right quasi k-Gorenstein ring \Lambda, we show that the right self-injective dimension of \Lambda is at most k if and only if each M \inmod \Lambda satisfying the condition that Ext_{\Lambda}^i(M, \Lambda)=0 for any 1\leq i \leq k is reflexive. For an \infty-Gorenstein ring, we show that the big and small finitistic dimensions and the self-injective dimension of \Lambda are identical. In addition, we show that if \Lambda is a left quasi \infty-Gorenstein ring and M\inmod \Lambda with gradeM finite, then Ext_{\Lambda}^i(Ext_{\Lambda ^{op}}^i(Ext_{\Lambda}^{{\rm grade}M}(M, \Lambda), \Lambda), \Lambda)=0 if and only if i\neqgradeM. For a 2-Gorenstein ring \Lambda, we show that a non-zero proper left ideal I of \Lambda is reflexive if and only if \Lambda /I has no non-zero pseudo-null submodule.
