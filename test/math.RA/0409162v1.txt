In this paper we show that if \Lambda=\amalg_{i\geq 0}\Lambda_i is a Koszul algebra with \Lambda_0 isomorphic to a product of copies of a field, then the minimal projective resolution of \Lambda_0 as a right \Lambda-module provides all the information necessary to construct both a minimal projective resolution of \Lambda_0 as a left \Lambda-module and a minimal projective resolution of \Lambda as a right module over the enveloping algebra of \Lambda. The main tool for this is showing that there is a comultiplicative structure on a minimal projective resolution of \Lambda_0 as a right \Lambda-module.
