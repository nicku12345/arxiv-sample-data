Let \Lambda be a left and right noetherian ring and \mod \Lambda the category of finitely generated left \Lambda-modules. In this paper we show the following results: (1) For a positive integer k, the condition that the subcategory of \mod \Lambda consisting of i-torsionfree modules coincides with the subcategory of \mod \Lambda consisting of i-syzygy modules for any 1\leq i \leq k is left-right symmetric. (2) If \Lambda is an Auslander ring and N is in \mod \Lambda ^{op} with \grade N=k<\infty, then N is pure of grade k if and only if N can be embedded into a finite direct sum of copies of the (k+1)st term in a minimal injective resolution of \Lambda as a right \Lambda-module. (3) Assume that both the left and right self-injective dimensions of \Lambda are k. If \grade {\rm Ext}_{\Lambda}^k(M, \Lambda)\geq k for any M\in\mod \Lambda and \grade {\rm Ext}_{\Lambda}^i(N, \Lambda)\geq i for any N\in\mod \Lambda ^{op} and 1\leq i \leq k-1, then the socle of the last term in a minimal injective resolution of \Lambda as a right \Lambda-module is non-zero.
