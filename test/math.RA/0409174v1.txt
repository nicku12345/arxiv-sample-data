Let \Lambda be a quasi k-Gorenstein ring. For each dth syzygy module M in mod \Lambda (where 0 \leq d \leq k-1), we obtain an exact sequence 0 \to B \to M \bigoplus P \to C \to 0 in mod \Lambda with the properties that it is dual exact, P is projective, C is a (d+1)st syzygy module, B is a dth syzygy of Ext_{\Lambda}^{d+1}(D(M), \Lambda) and the right projective dimension of B^* is less than or equal to d-1. We then give some applications of such an exact sequence as follows. (1) We obtain a chain of epimorphisms concerning M, and by dualizing it we then get the spherical filtration of Auslander and Bridger for M^*. (2) We get Auslander and Bridger's Approximation Theorem for each reflexive module in mod \Lambda ^{op}. (3) We show that for any 0 \leq d \leq k-1 each dth syzygy module in mod \Lambda has an Evans-Griffith representation. As an immediate consequence of (3), we have that, if \Lambda is a commutative noetherian ring with finite self-injective dimension, then for any non-negative integer d, each dth syzygy module in mod \Lambda has an Evans-Griffith representation, which generalizes an Evans and Griffith's result to much more general setting.
