In this paper we give a sufficient condition of the existence of {\rm \mathbb{W}}^{t}-approximation presentations. We also introduce property (W^{k}). As an application of the existence of {\rm \mathbb{W}}^{t}-approximation presentations we give a connection between the finitistic dimension conjecture, the Auslander-Reiten conjecture and property (W^{k}).
