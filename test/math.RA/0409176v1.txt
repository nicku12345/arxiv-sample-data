Let \Lambda and \Gamma be artin algebras and _{\Lambda}U_{\Gamma} a faithfully balanced selforthogonal bimodule. We show that the U-dominant dimensions of _{\Lambda}U and U_{\Gamma} are identical. As applications to the results obtained, we give some characterizations of double dual functors (with respect to _{\Lambda}U_{\Gamma}) preserving monomorphisms and being left exact respectively.
