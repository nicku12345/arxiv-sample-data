Let \Lambda and \Gamma be artin algebras and _{\Lambda}U_{\Gamma} a faithfully balanced selforthogonal bimodule. In this paper, we first introduce the notion of k-Gorenstein modules with respect to _{\Lambda}U_{\Gamma} and then characterize it in terms of the U-resolution dimension of some special injective modules and the property of the functors {\rm Ext}^{i}({\rm Ext}^{i}(-, U), U) preserving monomorphisms, which develops a classical result of Auslander. As an application, we study the properties of dual modules relative to Gorenstein bimodules. In addition, we give some properties of _{\Lambda}U_{\Gamma} with finite left or right injective dimension.
