We study symplectic structures on characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras (CNLAs) by computing the cohomology space H^2(\Lg,k) for certain Lie algebras \Lg. Among these Lie algebras are filiform CNLAs of dimension n\le 14. It turns out that there are many examples of CNLAs which admit a symplectic structure. A generalization of a sympletic structure is an affine structure on a Lie algebra.
