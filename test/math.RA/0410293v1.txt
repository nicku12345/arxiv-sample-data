Let H_c be the rational Cherednik algebra of type A_{n-1} with spherical subalgebra U_c=eH_ce. Then U_c is filtered by order of differential operators with associated graded ring gr U_c=C[h + h*]^W, where W is the n-th symmetric group. Using the Z-algebra construction from our earlier paper (math.RA/0407516) it is also possible to associate to a filtered H_c- or U_c-module M a coherent sheaf on the Hilbert scheme Hilb(n).   Using this technique, we study the representation theory of U_c and H_c, and relate it to Hilb(n) and to the resolution of singularities from Hilb(n) to h+h*/W. For example, we prove:   (1) If c=1/n, so that L_c(triv) is the unique one-dimensional simple H_c-module, then L_c(triv) corresponds to the structure sheaf of the punctual Hilbert scheme.   (2) If c=1/n+k (for k some natural number) then, under a canonical filtration on the finite dimensional module L_c(triv), gr eL_{c}(triv) has a natural bigraded structure which coincides with that on the global sections of certain ample line bundles on the punctual Hilbert scheme; this confirms conjectures of Berest, Etingof and Ginzburg, and relates representations of H_c and U_c with Haiman's combinatorial work on the Hilbert scheme.   (3) Under mild restrictions on c, the characteristic cycle of the standard H_c-modules are described in terms of certain irreducible subvarieties of the Hilbert scheme (appearing originally in work of Grojnowski) with multiplicities given by Kostka numbers.
