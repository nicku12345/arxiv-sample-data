The monoidal version of classical Morita theory is a theory of bialgebroids. To make this explicit we construct a bicategory the objects of which are the bialgebroids and in which equivalence of objects means that the corresponding module categories are monoidally equivalent. The module categories of bialgebroids and of Frobenius Hopf algebroids are characterized by the existence of strong comonoid progenerators and strong Frobenius progenerators, respectively.
