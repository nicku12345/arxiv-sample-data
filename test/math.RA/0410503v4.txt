Let F denote the homotopy fiber of a map f:K-->L of 2-reduced simplicial sets. Using as input data the strongly homotopy coalgebra structure of the chain complexes of K and L, we construct a small, explicit chain algebra, the homology of which is isomorphic as a graded algebra to the homology of GF, the simplicial (Kan) loop group on F. To construct this model, we develop machinery for modeling the homotopy fiber of a morphism of chain Hopf algebras.   Essential to our construction is a generalization of the operadic description of the category DCSH of chain coalgebras and of strongly homotopy coalgebra maps given in (math.AT/0505559) to strongly homotopy morphisms of comodules over Hopf algebras. This operadic description is expressed in terms of a general theory of monoidal structures in categories with morphism sets parametrized by co-rings, which we elaborate here.
