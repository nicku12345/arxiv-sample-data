Let k denote a field with nontrivial discrete valuation. We assume that k is complete with perfect residue field. Let G be the group of k-rational points of a reductive, linear algebraic group defined over k. Let \gg denote the Lie algebra of G. Fix r \in \R. Subject to some restrictions, we show that the set of distinguished degenerate Moy-Prasad cosets of depth r (up to an equivalence relation) parametrizes the nilpotent orbits in \gg.
