S. Alesker has shown that if G is a compact subgroup of O(n) acting transitively on the unit sphere S^{n-1} then the vector space Val^G of continuous, translation-invariant, G-invariant convex valuations on R^n has the structure of a finite dimensional graded algebra over R satisfying Poincare duality. We show that the kinematic formulas for G are determined by the product pairing. Using this result we then show that the algebra Val^{U(n) } is isomorphic to R[s,t]/(f_{n+1}, f_{n+2}), where s,t have degrees 2 and 1 respectively, and the polynomial f_i is the degree i term of the power series \log(1 + s +t).
