Let S be the left R-bialgebroid of a depth two extension with centralizer R as defined in math.QA/0108067. We show that the left endomorphism ring of depth two extension, not necessarily balanced, is a left S-Galois extension of A^{\rm op}. Looking to examples of depth two, we establish that a Hopf subalgebra is normal if and only if it is a Hopf-Galois extension. We find a class of examples of the alternative Hopf algebroids in math.QA/0302325. We also characterize finite weak Hopf-Galois extensions using an alternate Galois canonical mapping with several corollaries: that these are depth two and that surjectivity of the Galois mapping implies its bijectivity.
