Let G be a finite subgroup of SL(2,C). Let S_N#G^N be the wreath product of G by the symmetric group of degree N, acting symplectically on a complex vector space V of dimension 2N, with symplectic basis {x_i, y_i} i=1,...,N. In this paper we classify all the irreducible representations of S_N#G^N that can be extended to a representation of the associated symplectic reflection algebra H(k,c,N,G) (where k is a complex number and c a class function on the non-trivial elements of G) for non-zero values of k and with trivial action of the generators x_i,y_i\in H(k,c,N,G).
