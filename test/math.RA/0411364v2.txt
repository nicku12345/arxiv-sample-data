We consider filtered or graded algebras A over a field K. Assume that there is a discrete valuation O_v of K with m_v its maximal ideal and k_v:=O_v/m_v its residue field. Let \Lambda be O_v-order such that \Lambda K=A and \bar{\Lambda}:=k_v\otimes_{O_v}\Lambda the \Lambda-reduction of A at the place K\leadsto k_v. Using the filtration of A induced by \Lambda we shall prove that for certain algebras A their properties are related to \bar{\Lambda}.
