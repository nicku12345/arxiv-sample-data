Associated to any complex simple Lie algebra is a non-reductive complex Lie algebra which we call the intermediate Lie algebra. We propose that these algebras can be included in both the magic square and the magic triangle to give an additional row and column. The extra row and column in the magic square corresponds to the sextonions. This is a six dimensional subalgebra of the split octonions which contains the split quaternions.
