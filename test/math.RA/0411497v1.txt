We construct four families of Artin-Schelter regular algebras of global dimension four. Under some generic conditions, this is a complete list of Artin-Schelter regular algebras of global dimension four that are generated by two elements of degree 1. These algebras are also strongly noetherian, Auslander regular and Cohen-Macaulay. One of the main tools is Keller's higher-multiplication theorem on A-infinity Ext-algebras.
