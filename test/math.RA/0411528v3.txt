We define and investigate a class of Koszul quasi-hereditary algebras for which there is a natural equivalence between the bounded derived category of graded modules and the bounded derived category of graded modules over (a proper version of) the extension algebra of standard modules. Examples of such algebras include, in particular, the multiplicity free blocks of the BGG category \mathcal{O}, and some quasi-hereditary algebras with Cartan decomposition in the sense of K{\"o}nig.
