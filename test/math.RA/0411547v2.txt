An anti-torus is a subgroup <a,b> in the fundamental group of a compact non-positively curved space X, acting in a specific way on the universal covering space \tilde{X} such that a and b do not have any commuting non-trivial powers. We construct and investigate anti-tori in a class of commutative transitive fundamental groups of finite square complexes, in particular for the groups \Gamma_{p,l} originally studied by Mozes [15]. It turns out that anti-tori in \Gamma_{p,l} directly correspond to non-commuting pairs of Hamilton quaternions. Moreover, free anti-tori in \Gamma_{p,l} are related to free groups generated by two integer quaternions, and also to free subgroups of \mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{Q}). As an application, we prove that the multiplicative group generated by the two quaternions 1+2i and 1+4k is not free.
