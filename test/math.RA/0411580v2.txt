The purpose of this paper is to prove the koszulity of the operad {\mathcal Quad}, governing quadri-algebras. That {\mathcal Quad} is Koszul was conjectured by Aguiar and Loday. The operad {\mathcal Dend}, governing dendriform algebras, is known to be Koszul, by work of Loday, and {\mathcal Quad} is its second black square power. We find a new complex, based on the associahedron, which captures the structure of {\mathcal Dend}. This complex behaves well with respect to the black squaring process, and allows us to conclude. Also, this proves koszulity of higher powers of {\mathcal Dend}.
