A complete description of the coadjoint orbits for A_{n-1}^{+}, the nilpotent Lie algebra of n-by-n strictly upper triangular matrices, has not yet been obtained, though there has been steady progress on it ever since the orbit method was devised.   We apply methods developed by Andre' to find defining equations for the elementary coadjoint orbits for the maximal nilpotent Lie subalgebras of the orthogonal   Lie algebras, and we also determine all the possible dimensions of coadjoint orbits in the case of A_{n-1}^{+}.
