We reduce certain proofs in math.RA/0108067, math.RA/0408155, and math.QA/0409589 to depth two quasibases from one side only, a minimalistic approach which leads to a characterization of Galois extensions for finite projective bialgebroids without the Frobenius extension property. We prove that a proper algebra extension is a left T-Galois extension for some right finite projective left bialgebroid over some algebra R if and only if it is a left depth two and left balanced extension. Exchanging left and right in this statement, we have a characterization of right Galois extensions for left finite projective right bialgebroids. Looking to examples of depth two, we establish that a Hopf subalgebra is normal if and only if it is a Hopf-Galois extension. We characterize finite weak Hopf-Galois extensions using an alternate Galois canonical mapping with several corollaries: that these are depth two and that surjectivity of the Galois mapping implies its bijectivity.
