Iterated loop algebras are by definition obtained by repeatedly applying the loop construction, familiar from the theory of affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras, to a given base algebra. Our interest in this iterated construction is motivated by its use in the realization of extended affine Lie algebras, but the construction also appears naturally in the study of other classes of algebras. This paper consists of a detailed study of the basic properties of iterated loop algebras.
