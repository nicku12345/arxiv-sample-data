Let x, y be two integral quaternions of norm p and l, respectively, where p, l are distinct odd prime numbers. We investigate the structure of <x,y>, the multiplicative group generated by x and y. Under a certain condition which excludes <x,y> from being free or abelian, we show for example that <x,y>, its center, commutator subgroup and abelianization are finitely presented infinite groups. We give many examples where our condition is satisfied and compute as an illustration a finite presentation of the group <1+j+k, 1+2j> having these two generators and seven relations. In a second part, we study the basic question whether there exist commuting quaternions x and y for fixed p, l, using results on prime numbers of the form r^2 + m s^2 and a simple invariant for commutativity.
