Over a field of characteristic 0, the algebra of invariants of several n\times n matrices under simultaneous conjugation by GL_n is generated by traces of products of generic matrices. In this paper we have found, in terms of representation theory of GL_2, a minimal set of generators of the algebra of invariants of two 4\times 4 matrices. The proof is purely combinatorial and involves computer calculations with standard functions of Maple.
