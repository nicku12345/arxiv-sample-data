Eastwood and Ezhov generalized the Cayley surface to the Cayley hypersurface in each dimension, proved some characteristic properties of the Cayley hypersurface and conjectured that a homogeneous hypersurface in affine space satisfying these properties must be the Cayley hypersurface. We will prove this conjecture when the domain bounded by a graph of a function defined on \R^n is also homogeneous giving a characterization of Cayley hypersurface. The idea of the proof is to look at the problem of affine homogeneous hypersurfaces as that of left symmetric algebras with a Hessian type inner product. This method gives a new insight and powerful algebraic tools for the study of homogeneous affine hypersurfaces.
