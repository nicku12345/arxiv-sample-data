In this paper we prove Schur-Weyl duality between the symplectic group and Brauer algebra over an arbitrary infinite field K. We show that the natural homomorphism from the Brauer algebra B_n(-2m) to the endomorphism algebra of tensor space (K^{2m})^{\otimes n} as a module over the symplectic similitude group GSp_{2m}(K) (or equivalently, as a module over the symplectic group Sp_{2m}(K)) is always surjective. Another surjectivity, that of the natural homomorphism from the group algebra for GSp_{2m}(K) to the endomorphism algebra of (K^{2m})^{\otimes n} as a module over B_n(-2m), is derived as an easy consequence of S.~Oehms' results [S. Oehms, J. Algebra (1) 244 (2001), 19--44].
