Let E be an algebraic extension of a global field E_{0} with a nontrivial Brauer group Br(E), and let P(E) be the set of those prime numbers p, for which E does not equal its maximal p-extension E(p). This paper shows that E admits one-dimensional local class field theory if and only if there exists a system V(E) = \{v(p)\colon \ p \in P(E)\} of (nontrivial) absolute values, such that E(p) \otimes_{E} E_{v(p)} is a field, where E_{v(p)} is the completion of E with respect to v(p). When this occurs, we determine by V(E) the norm groups of finite extensions of E, and the structure of Br(E). It is also proved that if P is a nonempty set of prime numbers and \{w(p)\colon \ p \in P\} is a system of absolute values of E_{0}, then one can find a field K algebraic over E_{0} with such a theory, so that P(K) = P and the element \kappa (p) \in V(K) extends w(p), for each p \in P.
