We extend the combinatorial Morse complex construction to the arbitrary free chain complexes, and give a short, self-contained, and elementary proof of the quasi-isomorphism between the original chain complex and its Morse complex.   Even stronger, the main result states that, if C_* is a free chain complex, and \cm an acyclic matching, then C_*=C_*^\cm\oplus T_*, where C_*^\cm is the Morse complex generated by the critical elements, and T_* is an acyclic complex.
