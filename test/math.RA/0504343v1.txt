We study general properties of quantisations of Slodowy slices and discuss in detail the case of the minimal nilpotent orbit. Associated varieties of related primitive ideals of U(g) are determined, in the general case, and the de Vos-van Driel conjecture on Verma modules for finite W-algebras is proved in the minimal nilpotent case.
