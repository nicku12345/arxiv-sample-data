The minimal projective bimodule resolutions of the exterior algebras are explicitly constructed. They are applied to calculate the Hochschild (co)homology of the exterior algebras. Thus the cyclic homology of the exterior algebras can be calculated in case the underlying field is of characteristic zero. Moreover, the Hochschild cohomology rings of the exterior algebras are determined by generators and relations.
