Let V denote a vector space with finite positive dimension, and let (A,B) denote a Leonard pair on V. As is known, the linear transformations A,B satisfy the Askey-Wilson relations A^2B -bABA +BA^2 -g(AB+BA) -rB = hA^2 +wA +eI,   B^2A -bBAB +AB^2 -h(AB+BA) -sA = gB^2 +wB +fI, for some scalars b,g,h,r,s,w,e,f. The scalar sequence is unique if the dimension of V is at least 4. If c,c*,t,t* are scalars and t,t* are not zero, then (tA+c,t*B+c*) is a Leonard pair on V as well. These affine transformations can be used to bring the Leonard pair or its Askey-Wilson relations into a convenient form. This paper presents convenient normalizations of Leonard pairs by the affine transformations, and exhibits explicit Askey-Wilson relations satisfied by them.
