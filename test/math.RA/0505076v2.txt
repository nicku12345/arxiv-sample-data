Killing of supports along subsets \mathcal{U} of a group G and regradings along certain maps of groups \phi :G'\longrightarrow G are studied, in the context of group-graded algebras. We show that, under precise condition on \mathcal{U} and \phi, the graded module theories over the initial and the final algebras are functorially well-connected. Special attention is paid to G=\mathbf{Z}, in which case the results can be applied to n-Koszul algebras.
