Let (W,S) be a finite Coxeter system. Tits defined an associative product on the set \Sigma of simplices of the associated Coxeter complex. The corresponding semigroup algebra is the Solomon-Tits algebra of W. It contains the Solomon algebra of W as the algebra of invariants with respect to the natural action of W on \Sigma. For the symmetric group S_n, there is a 1-1 correspondence between \Sigma and the set of all set compositions (or ordered set partitions) of \{1,...,n\}. The product on \Sigma has a simple combinatorial description in terms of set compositions. We study in detail the representation theory of the Solomon-Tits algebra of S_n over an arbitrary field, and show how our results relate to the corresponding results on the Solomon algebra of S_n. This includes the construction of irreducible and principal indecomposable modules, a description of the Cartan invariants, of the Ext-quiver, and of the descending Loewy series. Our approach builds on a (twisted) Hopf algebra structure on the direct sum of all Solomon-Tits algebras.
