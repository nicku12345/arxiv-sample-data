For a commutative local ring R, consider (noncommutative) R-algebras \Lambda of the form \Lambda = End_R(M) where M is a reflexive R-module with nonzero free direct summand. Such algebras \Lambda of finite global dimension can be viewed as potential substitutes for, or analogues of, a resolution of singularities of Spec R. For example, Van den Bergh has shown that a three-dimensional Gorenstein normal C-algebra with isolated terminal singularities has a crepant resolution of singularities if and only if it has such an algebra \Lambda with finite global dimension and which is maximal Cohen--Macaulay over R (a ``noncommutative crepant resolution of singularities''). We produce algebras \Lambda=End_R(M) having finite global dimension in two contexts: when R is a reduced one-dimensional complete local ring, or when R is a Cohen--Macaulay local ring of finite Cohen--Macaulay type. If in the latter case R is Gorenstein, then the construction gives a noncommutative crepant resolution of singularities in the sense of Van den Bergh.
