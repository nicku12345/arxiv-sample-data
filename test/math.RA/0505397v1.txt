The Carlitz \mathbb{F}_q-algebra C=C_\nu, \nu \in \mathbb{N}, is generated by an algebraically closed field \CK  (which contains a non-discrete locally compact field of positive characteristic p>0, i.e. K\simeq \mathbb{F}_q[[ x,x^{-1}]], q=p^\nu), by the (power of the) {\em Frobenius} map X=X_\nu :f\mapsto f^q, and by the {\em Carlitz derivative} Y=Y_\nu. It is proved that the Krull and global dimensions of C are 2, a classification of simple C-modules and ideals are given, there are only {\em countably many} ideals, they commute (IJ=JI), and each ideal is a unique product of maximal ones. It is a remarkable fact that any simple C-module is a sum of eigenspaces of the element YX (the set of eigenvalues for YX is given explicitly for each simple C-module). This fact is crucial in finding the group \Aut_{\Fq}(C) of \Fq-algebra automorphisms of C and in proving that two distinct Carlitz rings are not isomorphic (C_\nu \not\simeq C_\mu if \nu \neq \mu). The centre of C is found explicitly, it is a UFD that contains {\em countably many} elements.
