The structure of multivariate semisimple codes over a finite chain ring R is established using the structure of the residue field \bar R. Multivariate codes extend in a natural way the univariate cyclic and negacyclic codes and include some non-trivial codes over R. The structure of the dual codes in the semisimple abelian case is also derived and some conditions on the existence of selfdual codes over R are studied.
