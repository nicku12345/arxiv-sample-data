We extend the comatrix coring to the case of a quasi-finite bicomodule. We also generalize some of its interesting properties. We study equivalences between categories of comodules over rather general corings. We particularize to the case of the adjoint pair of functors associated to a morphism of corings over different base rings. We apply our results to corings coming from entwining structures and graded structures, and we obtain new results in the setting of entwining structures and in the graded ring theory.
