Let \Lambda be a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field, then \Lambda is either tame or wild. Is there any homological description in terms of AR-translations on tameness? Or equivalently, is there any combinatorial description in terms of AR-quivers? The answer is yes. In the present paper we prove the following main theorem: ``\Lambda is tame if and only if almost all modules are isomorphic to their Auslander-Reiten translations, if and only if they lie in homogeneous tubes".   The method used in the paper is bimodule problem, which has been studied by several authors. We treat bimodule problems and their reductions in terms of matrices and generalized Jordan forms respectively. In particular, we introduce a concept of freely parameterized bimodule problems corresponding to layered bocses in order to define the reductions of bimodule problems. Moreover, we list all the possibilities of the differential of the first arrow of a layered bocs such that the induced bocs is still layered and preserves all the free parameters, especially in wild case.
