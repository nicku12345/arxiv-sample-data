Let G be a group, F a field of prime characteristic p and V a finite-dimensional FG-module. Let L(V) denote the free Lie algebra on V, regarded as an FG-module, and, for each positive integer r, let L^r(V) be the rth homogeneous component of L(V), called the rth Lie power of V. In a previous paper we obtained a decomposition of L^r(V) as a direct sum of modules of the form L^s(W), where s is a power of p. Here we derive some consequences. First we obtain a similar result for restricted Lie powers of V. Then we consider the `Lie resolvents' \Phi^r : certain functions on the Green ring of FG which determine Lie powers up to isomorphism. For k not divisible by p, we obtain the factorisation \Phi^{p^mk} = \Phi^{p^m} \circ \Phi^k, separating out the key case of p-power degree. Finally we study certain functions on power series over the Green ring, denoted by {\bf S}^* and {\bf L}^*, which encode symmetric powers and Lie powers, respectively. In characteristic 0, {\bf L}^* is the inverse of {\bf S}^*. In characteristic p, the composite {\bf L}^* \circ {\bf S}^* maps any p-typical power series to a p-typical power series.
