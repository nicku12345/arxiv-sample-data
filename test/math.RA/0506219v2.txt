Let K denote a field and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. By a Leonard pair on V we mean an ordered pair of linear transformations A:V \to V and A^*:V \to V that satisfy the following two conditions:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   Let v^*_0, ..., v^*_d (resp. v_0, ..., v_d) denote a basis for V that satisfies (i) (resp. (ii)). For 0 \leq i \leq d let a_i denote the coefficient of v^*_i, when we write A v^*_i as a linear combination of v^*_0, ..., v^*_d, and let a^*_i denote the coefficient of v_i, when we write A^* v_i as a linear combination of v_0..., v_d. In this paper we show a_0=a_d if and only if a^*_0=a^*_d. Moreover we show that for d \geq 1 the following are equivalent: (i) a_0=a_d and a_1=a_{d-1}; (ii) a^*_0=a^*_d and a^*_1=a^*_{d-1}; (iii) a_i=a_{d-i} and a^*_i=a^*_{d-i} for 0 \leq i \leq d. We say A, A^* is balanced whenever (i)--(iii) hold. We say A, A^* is essentially bipartite (resp. essentially dual bipartite}) whenever a_i (resp. a^*_i) is independent of i for 0 \leq i \leq d. Observe that if A, A^* is essentially bipartite or dual bipartite, then A, A^* is balanced. For d \neq 2 we show that if A, A^* is balanced then A, A^* is essentially bipartite or dual bipartite.
