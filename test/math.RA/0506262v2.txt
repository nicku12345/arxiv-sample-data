Let \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{+}\oplus \mathcal{L}_{-} be a finite dimensional color Lie superalgebra over a field of characteristic 0 with universal enveloping algebra U(\mathcal{L}). We show that \limfunc{gldim}(U(\mathcal{L}_{+}))= \limfunc{lFPD}(U(\mathcal{L}))= \limfunc{rFPD}(U(\mathcal{L}))= \limfunc{injdim}_{U(\mathcal{L})}(U(\mathcal{L}))= \dim (\mathcal{L}_{+}).   We also prove that U(\mathcal{L}) is Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and thus that it has a QF classical quotient ring.
