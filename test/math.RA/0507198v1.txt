We define the associated variety  X_{M}  of a module  M  over a finite-dimensional superalgebra  {\mathfrak g} , and show how to extract information about  M  from these geometric data.  X_{M}  is a subvariety of the cone  X  of self-commuting odd elements.   For finite-dimensional  M ,  X_{M}  is invariant under the action of the underlying Lie group  G_{0} . For simple superalgebra with invariant symmetric form,  X  has finitely many  G_{0} -orbits; we associate a number (rank) to each such orbit. One can also associate a number (degree of atypicality) to an irreducible finite-dimensional representation.   We prove that if  M  is an irreducible  {\mathfrak g} -module of degree of atypicality  k , then  X_{M}  lies in the closure of all orbits on  X  of rank  k . If  {\mathfrak g}={\mathfrak g}{\mathfrak l}(m|n)  we prove that  X_{M}  coincides with this closure.
