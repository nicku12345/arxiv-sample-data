We show that the spherical subalgebra of the rational Cherednik algebra associated to the wreath product of a symmetric group and a cyclic group is isomorphic to a quotient of the ring of invariant differential operators on a space of representations of the cyclic quiver. This confirms a version of a conjecture of Etingof and Ginzburg in the case of cyclic groups. The proof is a straightforward application of work of Oblomkov on the deformed Harish-Chandra homomorphism, and of Crawley-Boevey and of Gan and Ginzburg on preprojective algebras.
