Let \Lambda=kQ/I be a Koszul algebra over a field k, where Q is a finite quiver. An algorithmic method for finding a minimal projective resolution \mathbb{F} of the graded simple modules over \Lambda is given in Green-Solberg. This resolution is shown to have a "comultiplicative" structure in Green-Hartman-Marcos-Solberg, and this is used to find a minimal projective resolution \mathbb{P} of \Lambda over the enveloping algebra \Lambda^e. Using these results we show that the multiplication in the Hochschild cohomology ring of \L relative to the resolution \mathbb{P} is given as a cup product and also provide a description of this product. This comultiplicative structure also yields the structure constants of the Koszul dual of \L with respect to a canonical basis over k associated to the resolution \mathbb{F}. The natural map from the Hochschild cohomology to the Koszul dual of \Lambda is shown to be surjective onto the graded centre of the Koszul dual.
