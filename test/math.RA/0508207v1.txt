In this paper we present a new family of minimal spectrally arbitrary patterns which allow for arbitrary spectrum by using the Nilpotent-Jacobian method. The novel approach here is that we use the Intermediate Value Theorem to avoid finding an explicit nilpotent realization of the new minimal spectrally arbitrary patterns.
