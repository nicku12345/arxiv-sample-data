Let K denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations A:V \to V and A^*:V \to V that satisfy (i), (ii) below:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a {\em Leonard pair} on V. In the literature on Leonard pairs there exist two parameter sequences called the first split sequence and the second split sequence. We display some attractive formulae for the first and second split sequence that involve the trace function.
