A \mu-algebra is a model of a first order theory that is an extension of the theory of bounded lattices, that comes with pairs of terms (f,\mu_{x}.f) where \mu_{x}.f is axiomatized as the least prefixed point of f, whose axioms are equations or equational implications.   Standard \mu-algebras are complete meaning that their lattice reduct is a complete lattice. We prove that any non trivial quasivariety of \mu-algebras contains a \mu-algebra that has no embedding into a complete \mu-algebra.   We focus then on modal \mu-algebras, i.e. algebraic models of the propositional modal \mu-calculus. We prove that free modal \mu-algebras satisfy a condition -- reminiscent of Whitman's condition for free lattices -- which allows us to prove that (i) modal operators are adjoints on free modal \mu-algebras, (ii) least prefixed points of \Sigma_{1}-operations satisfy the constructive relation \mu_{x}.f = \bigvee_{n \geq 0} f^{n}(\bot). These properties imply the following statement: {\em the MacNeille-Dedekind completion of a free modal \mu-algebra is a complete modal \mu-algebra and moreover the canonical embedding preserves all the operations in the class Comp(\Sigma_{1},\Pi_{1}) of the fixed point alternation hierarchy.}
