In this article are given explicit expressions for differential operators representing the action of any element of any Lie superalgebra g on a module induced or coinduced from an h-module V, where h is any subsuperalgebra of g. For the special case where g=g_+h, and g_ is a finite-dimensional subsuperalgebra of g, whose adjoint action on g is nilpotent, there is given a practical algorithm of calculation of this action. The program in C++ making the calculations for this case is also written.
