We show that the standard quantized coordinate ring A of quantum SL(N) satisfies van den Bergh's analogue of Poincare duality for Hochschild (co)homology with dualizing bimodule being A_sigma, the A-bimodule which is A as k-vector space with right multiplication twisted by the modular automorphism sigma of the Haar functional. This implies that H_{N^2-1} (A, A_sigma)=k, generalizing our previous results for quantum SL(2).
