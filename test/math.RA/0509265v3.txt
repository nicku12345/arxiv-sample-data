We uncover the structure of the space of symmetric functions in non-commutative variables by showing that the underlined Hopf algebra is both free and co-free. We also introduce the Hopf algebra of quasi-symmetric functions in non-commutative variables and define the product and coproduct on the monomial basis of this space and show that this Hopf algebra is free and cofree. In the process of looking for bases which generate the space we define orders on the set partitions and set compositions which allow us to define bases which have simple and natural rules for the product of basis elements.
