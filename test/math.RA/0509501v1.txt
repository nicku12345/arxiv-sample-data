Let A be a hereditary algebra. We construct a fundamental domain for the cluster category of A inside the category of modules over the duplicated algebra \bar{A} of A. We then prove that there exists a bijection between the tilting objects in the cluster category and the tilting \bar{A}-modules all of whose non projective-injective indecomposable summands lie in the left part of the module category of \bar{A}.
