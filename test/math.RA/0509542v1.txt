In this note we relate the valuations of the algebras appearing in the non-commutative geometry of quantized algebras to properties of sub-lattices in some vector spaces. We consider the case of algebras with PBW-bases and prove that under some mild assumptions the valuations of the ground field extend to a non-commutative valuation. Later we introduce the notion of F-reductor and graded reductor and reduce the problem of finding an extending non-commutative valuation to finding a reductor in an associated graded ring having a domain for its reduction.
