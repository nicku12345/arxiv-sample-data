For any algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic p and any non negative integer n K\"ulshammer defined ideals T\_nA^\perp of the centre of a symmetric k-algebra A. We show that for derived equivalent algebras A and B there is an isomorphism of the centres of A and B mapping T\_nA^\perp to T\_nB^\perp for all n. Recently H\'ethelyi, Horv\'ath, K\"ulshammer and Murray showed that this holds for Morita equivalent algebras.
