We study the congruence lattices of the multinomial lattices L(v) introduced by Bennett and Birkhoff. Our main motivation is to investigate Parikh equivalence relations that model concurrent computation. We accomplish this goal by providing an explicit description of the join dependency relation between two join irreducible elements and of its reflexive transitive closure. The explicit description emphasizes several properties and makes it possible to separate the equational theories of multinomial lattices by their dimensions.   In their covering of non modular varieties Jipsen and Rose define a sequence of equations SD_{n}(\land), for n \geq 0. Our main result sounds as follows: if v = (v_{1},...,v_{n}) \in N^{n} and v_{i} > 0 for i = 1,..., n, then the multinomial lattice L(v) satisfies SD_{n-1}(\land) and fails SD_{n-2}(\land).
