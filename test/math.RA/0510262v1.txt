Let U be the enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional nonabelian Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} over a field of characteristic zero. We show that there is an open nonempty open subset X of U_1 = \mathfrak{g}\oplus K such that   U/Ux is faithful for all x \in X. We prove similar results for homogenized enveloping algebras and for the three dimensional   Sklyanin algebras at points of infinite order. It would be interesting to know if there is a common generalization of these results.
