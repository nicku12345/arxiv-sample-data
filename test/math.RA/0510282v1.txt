We consider the zeta and M\"obius functions of a partial order on integer compositions first studied by Bergeron, Bousquet-M\'elou, and Dulucq. The M\"obius function of this poset was determined by Sagan and Vatter. We prove rationality of various formal power series in noncommuting variables whose coefficients are evaluations of the zeta function and the M\"obius function. The proofs are either directly from the definitions or by constructing finite-state automata.   We also obtain explicit expressions for generating functions obtained by specializing the variables to commutative ones. We reprove Sagan and Vatter's formula for the M\"obius function using this machinery. These results are closely related to those of Bj\"orner and Reutenauer about subword order, and we discuss a common generalization.
