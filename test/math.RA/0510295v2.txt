New solutions of twist equations for universal enveloping algebras U(A_{n-1}) are found. They can be presented as products of full chains F_c of extended Jordanian twists, Abelian factors (rotations) F^R and sets of quasi-Jordanian twists F^J. The latter are the generalizations of Jordanian twists (with 2-dimensional Borel carrier b^2) for special deformed extensions of the Hopf algebra U(b^2). The carrier subalgebra g_P for the composition of these three twists is a nonminimal parabolic subalgebra in sl(n). The parabolic twisting elements F_P are obtained in the explicit form. The details of the construction are illustrated for the examples n=4 and n=11.
