In this survey, we first present basic facts on A-infinity algebras and modules including their use in describing triangulated categories. Then we describe the Quillen model approach to A-infinity structures following K. Lefevre's thesis. Finally, starting from an idea of V. Lyubashenko's, we give a conceptual construction of A-infinity functor categories using a suitable closed monoidal category of cocategories. In particular, this yields a natural construction of the bialgebra structure on the bar construction of the Hochschild complex of an associative algebra.
