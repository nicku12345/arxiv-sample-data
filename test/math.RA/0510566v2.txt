In this paper we mainly study the derivations for even part of the finite-dimensional odd Hamiltonian superalgebra HO over a field of prime characteristic. We first give the generator set of HO_{\bar{0}}. Then we determine the homogeneous derivationsfrom HO_{\bar{0}} into W_{\bar{0}}, the even part of the generalized Witt superalgebra W. Finally, wedetermine the derivation algebra and outer derivation algebra of HO_{\bar{0}}.
