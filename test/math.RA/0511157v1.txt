We show that if \Lambda is a n-Koszul algebra and E=E(\Lambda) is its Yoneda algebra, then there is a full subcategory \mathcal{L}_E of the category Gr_E of graded E-modules, which contains all the graded E-modules presented in even degrees, that embeds fully faithfully into the category C(Gr_\Lambda) of cochain complexes of graded \Lambda-modules. That extends the known equivalence, for \Lambda Koszul (i.e. for n=2), between Gr_E and the category of linear complexes of graded \Lambda-modules
