A TTF-triple (\mathcal{C},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F}) in an abelian category is called 'one-sided split' in case either (\mathcal{C},\mathcal{T}) or (\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F}) is a split torsion theory. In this paper we classify one-sided split TTF-triples in module categories, thus completing Jans' classification of two-sided split TTF-triples and answering a question that has remained open for almost forty years.
