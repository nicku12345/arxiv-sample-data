In two 1966 papers, Jacques Tits gave a construction of exceptional Lie algebras (hence implicitly exceptional algebraic groups) and a classification of possible indexes of simple algebraic groups. For the special case of his construction that gives groups of type E6, we connect the two papers by answering the question: Given an Albert algebra A and a separable quadratic field extension K, what is the index of the resulting algebraic group?
