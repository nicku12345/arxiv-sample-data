The faithful quasi-dual H^d and strict quasi-dual H^{d'} of an infinite braided Hopf algebra H are introduced and it is proved that every strict quasi-dual H^{d'} is an H-Hopf module. The connection between the integrals and the maximal rational H^{d}-submodule H^{d rat} of H^{d} is found. That is, H^{d rat}\cong \int ^l_{H^d} \otimes H is proved. The existence and uniqueness of integrals for braided Hopf algebras in the Yetter-Drinfeld category (^B_B{\cal YD},C) are given.
