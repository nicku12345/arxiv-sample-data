An n-dimensional quantum torus is a twisted group algebra of the group \Z^n. It is called rational if all invertible commutators are roots of unity. In the present note we describe a normal form for rational n-dimensional quantum tori over any field. Moreover, we show that for n = 2 the natural exact sequence describing the automorphism group of the quantum torus splits over any field.
