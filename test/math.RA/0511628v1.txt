It is proved that the centre Z of the simply connected quantised universal enveloping algebra over C, U_{\e,P}(sl_n), \e a primitive l-th root of unity, l an odd integer >1, has a rational field of fractions. Furthermore it is proved that if l is a power of an odd prime, Z is a unique factorisation domain.
