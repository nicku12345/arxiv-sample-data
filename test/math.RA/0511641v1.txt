Let K denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations A:V \to V and A^*: V \to V that satisfy (i), (ii) below:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a {\em Leonard pair} on V. In this paper we investigate the commutator AA^*-A^*A. Our results are as follows. First assume the dimension of V is even. We show AA^*-A^*A is invertible and display several attractive formulae for the determinant. Next assume the dimension of V is odd. We show that the null space of AA^*-A^*A has dimension 1. We display a nonzero vector in this null space. We express this vector as a sum of eigenvectors for A and as a sum of eigenvectors for A^*.
