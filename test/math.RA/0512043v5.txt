Let \Delta be an oriented valued graph equipped with a group of admissible automorphisms satisfying a certain stability condition. We prove that the (coefficient-free) cluster algebra \mathcal A(\Delta/G) associated to the valued quotient graph \Delta/G is a subalgebra of the quotient \pi(\mathcal A(\Delta)) of the cluster algebra associated to \Delta by the action of G. When \Delta is a Dynkin diagram, we prove that \mathcal A(\Delta/G) and \pi(\mathcal A(\Delta)) coincide. As an example of application, we prove that affine valued graphs are mutation-finite, giving an alternative proof to a result of Seven.
