Let M_n(\mathbb{Z}) the ring of n-by-n matrices with integral entries, and n \geq 2. This paper studies the set G_n(\mathbb{Z}) of pairs (A,B) \in M_n(\mathbb{Z})^2 generating M_n(\mathbb{Z}) as a ring. We use several presentations of M_{n}(\mathbb{Z}) with generators X=\sum_{i=1}^n E_{i+1,i} and Y=E_{11} to obtain the following consequences. \begin{enumerate} \item Let k \geq 1. Then the rings M_n(\mathbb{Q})^k and \bigoplus_{j=1}^{k} M_{n_j} (\mathbb{Z}), where n_1, ..., n_k \geq 2 are pairwise relatively prime, have presentations with 2 generators and finitely many relations.   \item Let D be a commutative domain of sufficiently large characteristic over which every finitely generated projective module is free. We use 4 relations for X and Y to describe all representations of the ring M_{n}(D) into M_{m}(D) for m \geq n.   \item We obtain information about the asymptotic density of G_n(F) in M_n(F)^2 over different fields, and over the integers. \end{enumerate}
