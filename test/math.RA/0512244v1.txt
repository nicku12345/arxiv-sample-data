In math.GR/0510298, we showed that every F-quasigroup is linear over a special kind of Moufang loop called an NK-loop. Here we extend this relationship by showing an equivalence between the equational class of (pointed) F-quasigroups and the equational class corresponding to a certain notion of generalized module (with noncommutative, nonassociative addition) for an associative ring.
