Let A=A(x_{1},...,x_{n}) be a free associative algebra in \mathcal{A} freely generated over K by a set X=\{x_{1},...,x_{n}\}, End A be the semigroup of endomorphisms of A, and Aut End A be the group of automorphisms of the semigroup End A. We investigate the structure of the groups Aut End A and Aut \mathcal{A}^{\circ}, where \mathcal{A}^{\circ} is the category of finitely generated free algebras from \mathcal{A}. We prove that the group Aut End A is generated by semi-inner and mirror automorphisms of End F and the group Aut \mathcal{A}^{\circ} is generated by semi-inner and mirror automorphisms of the category \mathcal{A}^{\circ}.   This result solves an open Problem formulated in \cite{22}
