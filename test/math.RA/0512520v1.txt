Let k[X]{:=} k[x_0,x_1,..., x_n] be a polynomial algebra over a field k of characteristic zero. We offer an algorithm for calculation of kernel of Weitzenb\"ok derivation {d(x_i)=x_{i-1}}, ..., {d(x_0)=0}, {i=1... n} that is based on an analogue of the well known Casimir elements of finite dimensional Lie algebras. By using this algorithm, the kernel is calculated in the case n <7.
