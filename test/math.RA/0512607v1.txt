In this partly historical and partly research oriented note, we display a page of an unpublished mathematical diary of Helmut Wielandt's for 1951. There he gives a new proof of a theorem due to H. S. A. Potter on the matrix equation AB = \omega BA, which is related to the q-binomial theorem, and asks some further questions, which we answer. We also describe results by M. P. Drazin and others on this equation.
