Real and complex norms of a linear operator acting on a normed complexified space are considered. Bounds on the ratio of these norms are given. The real and complex norms are shown to coincide for four classes of operators:   1) real linear operators from L_p(\mu_1) to L_q(\mu_2), 1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty; 2) real linear operators between inner product spaces; 3) nonnegative linear operators acting between complexified function spaces with absolute and monotonic norms; 4) real linear operators from a complexified function space with a norm satisfying \|\Re x \|\leq \|x\| to L_\infty(\mu). The inequality p\leq q in Case 1 is shown to be sharp.   A class of norm extensions from a real vector space to its complexification is constructed that preserve operator norms.
