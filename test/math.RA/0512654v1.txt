Two new simple modular Lie superalgebras are obtained in characteristics 3 and 5, which share the property that their even parts are orthogonal Lie algebras and the odd parts their spin modules. The characteristic 5 case is shown to be related, by means of a construction of Tits, to the exceptional ten dimensional Jordan superalgebra of Kac.
