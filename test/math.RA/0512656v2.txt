Let X be a finitely generated left module over a left artinian ring R, and let p(X)=\{l_i\} be the infinite sequence of nonnegative integers where l_i is the length of the i-th term of the minimal projective resolution of X. We introduce a preorder relation \le on the set \{p(X)\} and characterize the elementary finite-dimensional algebras \Lambda with the following property. Let S be a simple \Lambda-module, and let T be a finitely generated module over an arbitrary left artinian ring R. If the projective dimension of S does not exceed the projective dimension of T, then p(S)\le p(T). We characterize the indicated algebras by quivers with relations.
