We classify reflexive graded right ideals, up to isomorphism and shift, of generic cubic three dimensional Artin-Schelter regular algebras. We also determine the possible Hilbert functions of these ideals. These results are obtained by using similar methods as for quadratic Artin-Schelter algebras. In particular our results apply to the enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg-Lie algebra from which we deduce a classification of right ideals of an invariant ring of the first Weyl algebra.
