Given a finite dimensional algebra C (over an algebraically closed field) of global dimension at most two, we define its relation-extension algebra to be the trivial extension C\ltimes \Ext_C^2(DC,C) of C by the C-C-bimodule \Ext_C^2(DC,C). We give a construction for the quiver of the relation-extension algebra in case the quiver of C has no oriented cycles. Our main result says that an algebra \tilde C is cluster-tilted if and only if there exists a tilted algebra C such that \tilde C is isomorphic to the relation-extension of C.
