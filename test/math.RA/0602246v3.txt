Poisson algebra is usually defined to be a commutative algebra together with a Lie bracket, and these operations are required to satisfy the Leibniz rule. We describe Poisson structures in terms of a single bilinear operation. This enables us to explore Poisson algebras in the realm of non-associative algebras. We study their algebraic and cohomological properties, their deformations as non-associative algebras, and give a classification in low dimensions
