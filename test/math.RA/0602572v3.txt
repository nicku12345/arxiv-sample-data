Let R be a left noetherian ring, S a right noetherian ring and _RU a generalized tilting module with S={\rm End}(_RU). The injective dimensions of _RU and U_S are identical provided both of them are finite. Under the assumption that the injective dimensions of _RU and U_S are finite, we describe when the subcategory \{{\rm Ext}_S^n(N, U)|N is a finitely generated right S-module\} is closed under submodules. As a consequence, we obtain a negative answer to a question posed by Auslander in 1969. Finally, some partial answers to Wakamatsu Tilting Conjecture are given.
