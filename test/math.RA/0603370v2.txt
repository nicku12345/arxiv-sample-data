The whole complex process to obtain a protein encoded by a gene is difficult to include in a mathematical model. There are many models for describing different aspects of a genetic network. Finding a better model is one of the most important and interesting questions in computational biology. Sequential dynamical systems have been developed for a theory of computer simulation, and in this paper, a genetic sequential dynamical system is introduced. A gene is considered to be a function which can take a finite number of values. We prove that a genetic sequential dynamical system is a mathematical good description for a finite state linear model introduced by Brazma in www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray/biology-intro.html, EMBL-EBI, European Bioinformatics Institute, (2000).
