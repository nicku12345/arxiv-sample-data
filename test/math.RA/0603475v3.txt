The paper studies quadratic and Koszul duality for modules over positively graded categories. Typical examples are modules over a path algebra, which is graded by the path length, of a not necessarily finite quiver with relations. We present a very general definition of quadratic and Koszul duality functors backed up by explicit examples. This generalises previous results in two substantial ways: We work in the setup of graded categories, i.e. we allow infinitely many idempotents and also define a ``Koszul'' duality functor for not necessarily Koszul categories. As an illustration of the techniques we reprove the Koszul duality of translation and Zuckerman functors for the classical category O in a quite elementary and explicit way. As applications we propose a definition of a "Koszul" dual category for integral blocks of Harish-Chandra bimodules and for blocks outside the critical hyperplanes for the Kac-Moody category O.
