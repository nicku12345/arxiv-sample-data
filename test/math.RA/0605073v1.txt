Let K be an {\em arbitrary} field of characteristic p>0 and \CD (P_n) be the ring of differential operators on a polynomial algebra P_n in n variables. A long anticipated {\em analogue of the inequality of Bernstein} is proved for the ring \CD (P_n). On the way, analogues of the concepts of   (Gelfand-Kirillov) {\em dimension, multiplicity, holonomic modules} are found in prime characteristic (giving answers to old questions of finding such analogs).An analogue of the {\em Quillen's Lemma} is proved for simple {\em finitely presented} \CD (P_n)-modules. In contrast to the characteristic zero case where the Geland-Kirillov dimension of a nonzero finitely generated \CD (P_n)-module M can be {\em any natural} number from the interval [n,2n], in the prime characteristic, the   (new) dimension \Dim (M) can be \underline{{\em any real}} number from the interval [n,2n].
