Let K denote a field and let V denote a vector space over K with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations A : V \to V and A^* : V \to V that satisfy (i) and (ii) below:   (i) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A^* is diagonal.   (ii) There exists a basis for V with respect to which the matrix representing A^* is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing A is diagonal.   We call such a pair a {\it Leonard pair} on V. Let \cal X denote the set of linear transformations X:V \to V such that the matrix representing X with respect to the basis (i) is tridiagonal and the matrix representing X with respect to the basis (ii) is tridiagonal. We show that \cal X is spanned by I, A, A^*, AA^*, A^*A, and these elements form a basis for \cal X provided the dimension of V is at least 3.
