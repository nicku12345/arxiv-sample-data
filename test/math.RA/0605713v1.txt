A characterization of an h-hemiregular hemiring in terms of a fuzzy h-ideal is provided. Some properties of prime fuzzy h-ideals of h-hemiregular hemirings are investigated. It is proved that a fuzzy subset \zeta of a hemiring S is a prime fuzzy left (right) h-ideal of S if and only if \zeta is two-valued, \zeta(0) = 1, and the set of all x in S such that \zeta(x) = 1 is a prime (left) right h-ideal of S. Finally, the similar properties for maximal fuzzy left (right) h-ideals of hemirings are considered.
