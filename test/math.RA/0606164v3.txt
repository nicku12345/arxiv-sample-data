Shuffle and quasi-shuffle products are well-known in the mathematics literature. They are intimately related to Loday's dendriform algebras, and were extensively used to give explicit constructions of free commutative Rota-Baxter algebras. In the literature there exist at least two other Rota-Baxter type algebras, namely, the Nijenhuis algebra and the so-called TD-algebra. The explicit construction of the free unital commutative Nijenhuis algebra uses a modified quasi-shuffle product, called the right-shift shuffle. We show that another modification of the quasi-shuffle product, the so-called left-shift shuffle, can be used to give an explicit construction of the free unital commutative TD-algebra. We explore some basic properties of TD-operators and show that the free unital commutative Nijenhuis algebra is a TD-algebra. We relate our construction to Loday's unital commutative dendriform trialgebras, including the involutive case. The concept of Rota-Baxter, Nijenhuis and TD-bialgebras is introduced at the end and we show that any commutative bialgebra provides such objects.
