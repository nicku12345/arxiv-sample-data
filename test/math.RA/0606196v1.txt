Let K be an arbitrary field of characteristic zero, P_n:= K[ x_1, ..., x_n] be a polynomial algebra, and P_{n, x_1}:= K[x_1^{-1}, x_1, ..., x_n], for n\geq 2. Let \s' \in {\rm Aut}_K(P_n) be given by  x_1\mapsto x_1-1, \quad x_1\mapsto x_2+x_1,\quad ... ,\quad x_n\mapsto x_n+x_{n-1}. It is proved that the algebra of invariants, F_n':= P_n^{\s'}, is a polynomial algebra in n-1 variables which is generated by [\frac{n}{2}] quadratic and [\frac{n-1}{2}] cubic (free) generators that are given explicitly.   Let \s \in {\rm Aut}_K(P_n) be given by %\s \in {\rm Aut}_K(P_n):  x_1\mapsto x_1, \quad x_1\mapsto x_2+x_1, \quad ... ,\quad x_n\mapsto x_n+x_{n-1}. It is well-known that the algebra of invariants, F_n:= P_n^\s, is finitely generated (Theorem of Weitzenb\"ock, \cite{Weitz}, 1932), has transcendence degree n-1, and that one can give an explicit transcendence basis in which the elements have degrees 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1. However, it is an old open problem to find explicit generators for F_n. We find an explicit vector space basis for the quadratic invariants, and prove that the algebra of invariants P_{n, x_1}^\s is a polynomial algebra over K[x_1, x_1^{-1}] in n-2 variables which is generated by [\frac{n-1}{2}] quadratic and [\frac{n-2}{2}] cubic (free) generators that are given explicitly.   The coefficients of these quadratic and cubic invariants throw light on the `unpredictable combinatorics' of invariants of affine automorphisms and of SL_2-invariants.
