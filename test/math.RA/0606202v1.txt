A method for establishing a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the cohomology of Loday-type algebras is presented. This method is then applied to dendriform dialgebras and three types of trialgebras introduced by Loday and Ronco. Along the way, our results are combined with a result of McClure-Smith to prove an analogue of Deligne's conjecture for Loday algebras.
