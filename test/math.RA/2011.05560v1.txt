In this paper we define and discuss the representations of n-BiHom-Lie algebra. We also introduce T_{\theta}-extensions and T_{\theta}^{\ast}-extensions of n-BiHom-Lie algebras and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for a 2m-dimensional quadratic n-Bihom-Lie algebra to be isomorphic to a T_{\theta}^{\ast}-extension. Moreover, we develop the one-parameter formal deformations of n-BiHom-Lie algebras, and we proved that the first and second cohomology groups are suitable to the deformation theory involving infinitesimals, equivalent deformations, and rigidity
