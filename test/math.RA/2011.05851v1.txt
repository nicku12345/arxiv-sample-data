The aim of this work is to investigate the structure of some skew twisted algebras, when the coefficient ring is a localization of the polynomial ring over the field of characteristic zero, and an involution is provided. A parallel construction of the rational twisted generalized Weyl algebras is given. We propose a method and explicit formulas for a constructive description of these algebras and their involution-symmetric invariant subalgebras based on the Gelfand-Zeitlin realization of the universal enveloping algebra of some complex Lie algebras. As concrete examples we discuss special unitary and orthogonal algebras of rank three.
