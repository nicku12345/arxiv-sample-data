The species of finite topological spaces admits two graded bimonoid structures, recently defined by F. Fauvet, L. Foissy, and the second author. In this article, we define a doubling of this species in two different ways. We build a bimonoid structure on each of these species and describe a cointeraction between them. We also investigate two related associative products obtained by dualisation.
