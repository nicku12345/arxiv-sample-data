We describe spectra of associative (not necessarily unital and not necessarily countable-dimensional) locally matrix algebras. We determine all possible spectra of locally matrix algebras and give a new proof of Dixmier-Baranov Theorem. As an application of our description of spectra we determine embeddings of locally matrix algebras.
