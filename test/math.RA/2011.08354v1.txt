The algebras of the title are infinite-dimensional graded Lie algebras L= \bigoplus_{i=1}^{\infty}L_i, over a field of positive characteristic p, which are generated by an element of degree 1 and an element of degree p, and satisfy [L_i,L_1]=L_{i+1} for i\ge p. %of maximal class in the sense that L/L^i has dimension i for all i>1. In case p=2 such algebras were classified by Caranti and Vaughan-Lee in 2003. We announce an extension of that classification to arbitrary prime characteristic, and prove several major steps in its proof.
