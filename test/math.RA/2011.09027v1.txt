Based on results by Dani\v{l}\v{c}enko, in 1987 Burris and Willard have conjectured that on any k-element domain where k\geq 3 it is possible to bicentrically generate every centraliser clone from its k-ary part. Later, for every k\geq 3, Snow constructed algebras with a k-element carrier set where the minimum arity of the clone of term operations from which the bicentraliser can be generated is at least (k-1)^2, which is larger than k for k\geq 3.   We prove that Snow's examples do not violate the Burris-Willard conjecture nor invalidate the results by Dani\v{l}\v{c}enko on which the latter is based. We also complement our results with some computational evidence for k=3, obtained by an algorithm to compute a primitive positive definition for a relation in a finitely generated relational clone over a finite set.
