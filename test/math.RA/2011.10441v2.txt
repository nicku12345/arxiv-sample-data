The calculus of classes and closure operations has proved to be a useful tool in group theory and has led to a deep theory in the study of finite soluble groups. More recently, parallel theories have started to be developed in various varieties of algebras, such as Lie, Leibniz, and Malcev algebras. This paper seeks to investigate the extent to which these later theories can be generalised to the variety of all non-associative algebras.
