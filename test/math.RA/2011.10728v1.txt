Let \mathcal{H} be a hereditary abelian category over a field k with finite dimensional \operatorname{Hom} and \operatorname{Ext} spaces. It is proved that the bounded derived category \mathcal{D}^b(\mathcal{H}) has a silting object iff \mathcal{H} has a tilting object iff \mathcal{D}^b(\mathcal{H}) has a simple-minded collection with acyclic \operatorname{Ext}-quiver. Along the way, we obtain a new proof for the fact that every presilting object of \mathcal{D}^b(\mathcal{H}) is a partial silting object. We also consider the question of complements for pre-simple-minded collections. In contrast to presilting objects, a pre-simple-minded collection \mathcal{R} of \mathcal{D}^b(\mathcal{H}) can be completed into a simple-minded collection iff the \operatorname{Ext}-quiver of \mathcal{R} is acyclic.
