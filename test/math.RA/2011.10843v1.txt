Regarding the question of how idempotent elements affect reversible property of rings, we study a version of reversibility depending on idempotents. In this perspective, we introduce {\it right} (resp., {\it left}) {\it e-reversible rings}. We show that this concept is not left-right symmetric. Basic properties of right e-reversibility in a ring are provided. Among others it is proved that if R is a semiprime ring, then R is right e-reversible if and only if it is right e-reduced if and only if it is e-symmetric if and only if it is right e-semicommutative. Also, for a right e-reversible ring R, R is a prime ring if and only if it is a domain. It is shown that the class of right e-reversible rings is strictly between that of e-symmetric rings and right e-semicommutative rings.
