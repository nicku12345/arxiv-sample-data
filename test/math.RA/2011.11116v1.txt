Let K be a field (finite or infinite) of char(K)\neq 2 and let UT_n=UT_n(K) be the n\times n upper triangular matrix algebra over K. If \cdot  is the usual product on UT_n then with the new product a\circ b=(1/2)(a\cdot b +b\cdot a) we have that UT_n is a Jordan algebra, denoted by UJ_n=UJ_n(K). In this paper, we describe the set of all \mathbb{Z}_2-graded polynomial identities of UJ_2 with any nontrivial \mathbb{Z}_2-grading. Moreover, we describe a linear basis for the corresponding relatively free \mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra.
