``Fusion rules'' are laws of multiplication among eigenspaces of an idempotent. We establish fusion rules for flexible power-associative algebras, following Albert. We define the notion of an axis in the noncommutative setting (compare with [HRS]) and accumulate information about pairs of axes. We also describe a class of noncommutative examples of flexible power-associative algebras.
