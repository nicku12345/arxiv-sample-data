Wu and Jans introduced quasi-projective modules where they say a \cal R module \cal M is quasi-projective if for every submodule \cal N, for every homomorphism f : {\cal M} \rightarrow {\cal M}/{\cal N} and every epimorphism j: {\cal M}\rightarrow {\cal M}/{\cal N} there is an endomorphism \phi of \cal M such that \phi\circ j=f. We say that a structure \cal S is quasi-projective if for every structure \cal T, for every homomorphism f : {\cal S} \rightarrow {\cal T} and every epimorphism j: {\cal S}\rightarrow {\cal T} there is an endomorphism \phi of \cal S such that \phi\circ j=f. In 2004 D. Jakub\'ikov\'a-Studenovsk\'a defined the concept of the factor algebra denoted by {\cal A}/{\cal B}, where {\cal A} is a monounary algebra and {\cal B} is a subalgebra of \cal A. In this paper, we characterise the quasi-projective monounary algebras of arbitrary cardinalities for the definition of D. Jakub\'ikov\'a-Studenovsk\'a and for the second definition.
