We generalize the notion of a Rota-Baxter operator on groups and the notion of a Rota-Baxter operator of weight 1 on Lie algebras and define and study the notion of a Rota-Baxter operator on a cocommutative Hopf algebra H. If H=F[G] is the group algebra of a group G or H=U(\mathfrak{g}) the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}, then we prove that Rota-Baxter operators on H are in one to one correspondence with corresponding Rota-Baxter operators on groups or Lie algebras.
