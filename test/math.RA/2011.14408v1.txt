M. Busaniche, R. Cignoli, C. Tsinakis and A. M. Wille showed that every residuated lattice induces a residuation on its full twist product. For their construction they used also lattice operations. We generalize this problem to left-residuated groupoids which need not be lattice-ordered. Hence, for the full twist product we cannot use the same construction. We present another appropriate construction which, however, does not preserve commutativity and associativity of multiplication. Hence we introduce so-called operator residuated posets to obtain another construction which preserves the mentioned properties, but the results of operators on the full twist product need not be elements, but may be subsets. We apply this construction also to restricted twist products and present necessary and sufficient conditions under which we obtain a pseudo-Kleene operator residuated poset.
