In 2004, some equivalent versions of Polya's permanent problem were listed in 24 versions. However, there is a flaw on the theorem that affirms an equivalence of version 11 and 12. In order to correct the slip, we provide a characterization when the determinant and permanent of a given nonnegative matrix are equal. Moreover, the new characterization yields necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality of the determinant and permanent of powers of a given nonnegative matrix.
