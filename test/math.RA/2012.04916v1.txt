We investigate from an algebraic and topological point of view the minimal prime spectrum of a universal algebra, considering the prime congruences w.r.t. the term condition commutator. Then we use the topological structure of the minimal prime spectrum to study extensions of universal algebras that generalize certain types of ring extensions.
