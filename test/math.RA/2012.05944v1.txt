Let F be a field and let F(X_1,\dots,X_n) be the field of rational functions in n variables X_1,\dots,X_n over F. Let T=X_1+\cdots+X_n\in F(X_1,\dots,X_n) and let m be a positive integer such that \text{char}\,F\nmid m. Is it possible to express each X_i as a rational function in X_1^m\dots,X_n^m and T over F? It is not difficult to prove that this can be done but it is another matter to show how this is done. We answer the above question affirmatively with a nonconstructive proof and a constructive proof.
