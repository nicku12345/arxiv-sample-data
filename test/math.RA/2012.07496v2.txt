We study the common splitting fields of symbol algebras of degree p^m over fields F of \operatorname{char}(F)=p. We first show that if any finite number of such algebras share a degree p^m simple purely inseparable splitting field, then they share a cyclic splitting field of the same degree. As a consequence, we conclude that every finite number of symbol algebras of degrees p^{m_0},\dots,p^{m_t} share a cyclic splitting field of degree p^{m_0+\dots+m_t}. This generalization recovers the known fact that every tensor product of symbol algebras is a symbol algebra. We apply a result of Tignol's to bound the symbol length of classes in \operatorname{Br}_{p^m}(F) whose symbol length when embedded into \operatorname{Br}_{p^{m+1}}(F) is 2 for p\in \{2,3\}. We also study similar situations in other Kato-Milne cohomology groups, where the necessary norm conditions for splitting exist.
