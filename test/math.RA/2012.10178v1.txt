In the paper we describe the derivations of two \mathbb{N}-graded infinity-dimensional Lie algebras \mathbf{n}_1 and \mathbf{n}_1 what are positive parts of affine Kats-Moody algebras A^{(1)}_1 and A^{(2)}_2, respectively. Then we construct all pro-solvable Lie algebras whose potential nilpotent ideals are \mathbf{n}_1 and \mathbf{n}_2. For two specific representatives of these classes low-dimensional (co)homology groups are computed.
