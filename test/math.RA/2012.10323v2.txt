In this paper, we determine minimal generating sets for several well-known monoids of matrices over semirings. In particular, we find minimal generating sets for the monoids consisting of: all n\times n boolean matrices when n\leq 8; the n\times n boolean matrices containing the identity matrix (the reflexive boolean matrices) when n\leq 7; the n\times n boolean matrices containing a permutation (the Hall matrices) when n \leq 8; the upper, and lower, triangular boolean matrices of every dimension; the 2 \times 2 matrices over the semiring \mathbb{N} \cup \{-\infty\} with addition \oplus defined by x\oplus y = \max(x, y) and multiplication \otimes given by x\otimes y = x + y (the max-plus semiring); the 2\times 2 matrices over any quotient of the max-plus semiring by the congruence generated by t = t + 1 where t\in \mathbb{N}; the 2\times 2 matrices over the min-plus semiring and its finite quotients by the congruences generated by t = t + 1 for all t\in \mathbb{N}; and the n \times n matrices over \mathbb{Z} / n\mathbb{Z} relative to their group of units.
