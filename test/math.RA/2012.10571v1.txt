We introduce and study a new class of generalized inverses in rings. An element a in a ring R has generalized Zhou inverse if there exists b\in R such that bab=b, b\in comm^2(a), a^n-ab\in \sqrt{J(R)} for some n\in {\Bbb N}. We prove that a\in R has generalized Zhou inverse if and only if there exists p=p^2\in comm^2(a) such that a^n-p\in \sqrt{J(R)} for some n\in {\Bbb N}. Cline's formula and Jacobson's Lemma for generalized Zhou inverses are established. In particular, the Zhou inverse in a ring is characterized.
