In this paper we study algebras with trace and their trace polynomial identities over a field of characteristic 0. We consider two commutative matrix algebras: D_2, the algebra of 2\times 2 diagonal matrices and C_2, the algebra of 2 \times 2 matrices generated by e_{11}+e_{22} and e_{12}. We describe all possible traces on these algebras and we study the corresponding trace codimensions. Moreover we characterize the varieties with trace of polynomial growth generated by a finite dimensional algebra. As a consequence, we see that the growth of a variety with trace is either polynomial or exponential.
