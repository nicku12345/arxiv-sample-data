In this paper we study matrix algebras with a degenerate trace in the framework of the theory of polynomial identities. The first part is devoted to the study of the algebra D_n of n \times n diagonal matrices. We prove that, in case of a degenerate trace, all its trace identities follow by the commutativity law and by pure trace identities. Moreover we relate the trace identities of D_{n+1} endowed with a degenerate trace, to those of D_n with the corresponding trace. This allows us to determine the generators of the trace T-ideal of D_3.   In the second part we study commutative subalgebras of M_k(F), denoted by C_k of the type F + J that can be endowed with the so-called strange traces: tr(a+j) = \alpha a + \beta j, for any a+j \in C_k, \alpha, \beta \in F. Here J is the radical of C_k. In case \beta = 0 such a trace is degenerate, and we study the trace identities satisfied by the algebra C_k, for every k \geq 2. Moreover we prove that these algebras generate the so-called minimal varieties of polynomial growth.   In the last part of the paper, devoted to the study of varieties of polynomial growth, we completely classify the subvarieties of the varieties of algebras of almost polynomial growth introduced in an earlier paper of the same authors.
