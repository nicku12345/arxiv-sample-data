In this paper, we first study properties of the lower central chains for Novikov algebras. Then we show that for every Lie nilpotent Novikov algebra~\mathcal{N}, the ideal of~\mathcal{N} generated by the set~\{ab - ba\mid a, b\in \mathcal{N}\} is nilpotent. We secondly provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph E and the field K for which the Leavitt path algebra L_K(E) is Lie solvable. Consequently, we obtain a complete description of Lie nilpotent Leavitt path algebras, and show that the Lie solvability of~L_K(E) and the Lie nilpotency of [L_K(E),L_K(E)] are the same.
