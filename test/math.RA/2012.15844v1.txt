Given a ring R, the notion of Sylvester rank function was conceived within the context of Cohn's classification theory of epic division R-rings.   In this paper we study and describe the space of Sylvester rank functions on certain families of rings, including Dedekind domains, simple left noetherian rings and skew Laurent polynomial rings \mathcal{D}[t^{\pm 1};\tau] for any division ring \mathcal{D} and any automorphism \tau of \mathcal{D}.
