Non-alternating Hamiltonian Lie algebras in three variables over a perfect field of characteristic 2 are considered. A classification of non-alternating Hamiltonian forms over an algebra of divided powers in three variables and of the corresponding simple Lie algebras is given. In particular, it is shown that the non-alternating Hamiltonian form may not be equivalent to its linear part. It is proved that the Lie algebras which correspond to the nonequivalent forms are not isomorphic.
