In our paper, we give a necessary and sufficient conditions for the kernels of the linear maps of finite Abelian group algebras to be Mathieu-Zhao spaces of K[G] if G is a finite Abelian group and K is a split field for G. Hence we classify all Mathieu-Zhao spaces of the finite Abelian group algebras if K is a split field for G.
