We study permutability properties of matrix semigroups over commutative bipotent semirings (of which the best-known example is the tropical semiring). We prove that every such semigroup is weakly permutable (a result previous stated in the literature, but with an erroneous proof) and then proceed to study in depth the question of when they are strongly permutable (which turns out to depend heavily on the semiring). Along the way we classify monogenic bipotent semirings and describe all isomorphisms between truncated tropical semirings.
