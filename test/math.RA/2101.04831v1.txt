In this paper, we introduce relative Rota-Baxter systems on Leibniz algebras and give some characterizations and new constructions. Then we construct a graded Lie algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are relative Rota-Baxter systems. This allows us to define a cohomology theory associated with a relative Rota-Baxter system. Finally, we study formal deformations and extendibility of finite order deformations of a relative Rota-Baxter system in terms of the cohomology theory.
