We continue a very fruitful line of inquiry into the multiplicative ideal theory of an arbitrary Leavitt path algebra L. Specifically, we show that factorizations of an ideal in L into irredundant products or intersections of finitely many prime-power ideals are unique, provided that the ideals involved are powers of distinct prime ideals. We also characterize the completely irreducible ideals in L, which turn out to be prime-power ideals of a special type, as well as ideals that can be factored into products or intersections of finitely many completely irreducible ideals.
