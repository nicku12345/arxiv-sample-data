Motivated by the notions of 2-good rings and fine rings, we define a 2-nilgood ring as a ring whose every non central-unit is the sum of two nilpotents. This is a study of 2-nilgood rings. The following results are obtained: (a) a ring is 2-nilgood iff it is either a 2-nilgood simple ring or a commutative local ring with nil Jacobson radical; (b) a 2-nilgood simple ring is a field if it is right Goldie; (c) a 2-nilgood ring containing a uniform right ideal is a commutative local ring with nil Jacobson radical; (d) a ring whose every non central-unit is a sum of a square-zero element and a nilpotent is a commutative local ring with nil Jacobson radical. We conclude with the conjecture that a 2-nilgood simple ring is a field.
