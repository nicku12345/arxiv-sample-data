Finding identities in nonassociative algebras plays an important role in the study of properties of these algebras. In this paper, we present some identities in alternative algebras and in algebras obtained by the Cayley-Dickson process. Moreover, the spectrum of matrices with coefficients in such algebras are investigated.
