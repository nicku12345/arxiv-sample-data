The aim of this paper is to introduce and study BiHom-associative dialgebras. We give various constructions and study its connections with BiHom-Poisson dialgebras and BiHom-Leibniz algebras. Next we discuss the central extensions of BiHom-diassociative and we describe the classification of n-dimensional BiHom-diassociative algebras for n less or equal to 4. Finally, we discuss derivations of BiHom-associative dialgebras.
