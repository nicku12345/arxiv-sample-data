Recently Takahiro Yabe gave an almost complete classification of primitive symmetric 2-generated axial algebras of Monster type. In this note, we construct a new infinite-dimensional primitive 2-generated symmetric axial algebra of Monster type (2, \frac{1}{2}) over a field of characteristic 5, and use this algebra to complete the last case left open.
