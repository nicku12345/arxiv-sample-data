Cancellative dimer algebras on a torus have many nice algebraic and homological properties. However, these nice properties disappear for dimer algebras on higher genus surfaces. We consider a new class of quiver algebras on surfaces, called 'geodesic ghor algebras', that reduce to cancellative dimer algebras on a torus, yet continue to have nice properties on higher genus surfaces. These algebras exhibit a rich interplay between their central geometry and the topology of the surface. We show that (nontrivial) geodesic ghor algebras do in fact exist, and give explicit descriptions of their central geometry. This article serves a companion to the article 'A generalization of cancellative dimer algebras to hyperbolic surfaces', where the main statement is proven.
