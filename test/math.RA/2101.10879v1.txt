In this paper we study the lower triangular matrix \mathbb{K}-algebra \Lambda:=\left[\begin{smallmatrix} T & 0 \\ M & U \end{smallmatrix}\right], where U and T are basic \mathbb{K}-algebras with enough idempotents and M is an U-T-bimodule where \mathbb{K} acts centrally. Moreover, we characterise in terms of U, T and M when, on one hand, the lower triangular matrix \mathbb{K}-algebra \Lambda is standardly stratified in the sense of the paper "A generalization theory of standardly stratified algebras I: Standardly stratified ringois"; and on another hand, when \Lambda is locally bounded in the sense of the paper "Locally finite generated modules over rings with enough idempotents". Finally, it is also studied several properties relating the projective dimensions in the categories of finitely generated modules \mathrm{mod}(U), \mathrm{mod}(T) and \mathrm{mod}(\Lambda).
