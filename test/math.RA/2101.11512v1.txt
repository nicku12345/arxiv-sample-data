Cancellative dimer algebras on a torus are noncommutative crepant resolutions, and in particular have many nice algebraic and homological properties. All of these properties disappear, however, for dimer algebras on higher genus surfaces. We consider a new class of quiver algebras on surfaces, called 'geodesic ghor algebras', that reduce to cancellative dimer algebras on a torus, yet continue to possess nice properties on higher genus surfaces. We show that noetherian localizations of these algebras are endomorphism rings of modules over their centers, and establish a rich interplay between their central geometry and the topology of the surface in which they are embedded.
