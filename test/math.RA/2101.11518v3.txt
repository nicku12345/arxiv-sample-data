First, we construct some families of nonsolvable anticommutative algebras, solvable Lie algebras and even nilpotent Lie algebras, that can be endowed with the structure of simple Hom-Lie algebras. This situation shows that a classification of simple Hom-Lie algebras would be unrealistic without any further restrictions. Therefore, we introduce the class of \emph{strongly simple Hom-Lie algebras}, which is the class of anticommutative algebras that are simple Hom-Lie with respect to all their twisting maps. We show some of its properties, provide a characterisation and explore some of its subclasses. Then, we classify completely regular simple Hom-Lie algebras over any arbitrary field. Furthermore, we establish that every simple anticommutative algebra of dimension 3 turns out to be a simple Lie algebra where its Lie bracket is deformed by a bijective linear map, and also we determine all the simple Hom-Lie algebras in dimension 2, that were wrongly claimed to be nonexistent in \cite{CH}.
