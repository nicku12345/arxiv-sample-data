The aim of this paper is to introduce and study graded and filtered gamma rings and gamma modules. We prove that the filtered \Gamma-ring (module) is a generalization of the notion of graded ring (module). Also, we construct a graded \Gamma-ring from a filtered \Gamma-ring. We investigate some properties of graded and fileterd Gamma rings and Gamma modules. Finally we define and study the strongly graded gamma rings.
