Given a symmetric Leibniz algebra (\mathcal{L},.), the product is Lie-admissible and defines a Lie algebra bracket [\;,\;] on \mathcal{L}. Let G be the connected and simply-connected Lie group associated to (\mathcal{L},[\;,\;]). We endow G with a Lie rack structure such that the right Leibniz algebra induced on T_eG is exactly (\mathcal{L},.). The obtained Lie rack is said to be associated to the symmetric Leibniz algebra (\mathcal{L},.). We classify symmetric Leibniz algebras in dimension 3 and 4 and we determine all the associated Lie racks. Some of such Lie racks give rise to non-trivial topological quandles. We study some algebraic properties of these quandles and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for {them} to be quasi-trivial.
