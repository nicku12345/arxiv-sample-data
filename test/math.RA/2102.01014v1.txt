In this article, we study the notion of a finite \Sigma-Rickart module, as a module theoretic analogue of a right semi-hereditary ring. A module M is called \emph{finite \Sigma-Rickart} if every finite direct sum of copies of M is a Rickart module. It is shown that any direct summand and any direct sum of copies of a finite \Sigma-Rickart module are finite \Sigma-Rickart modules. We also provide generalizations in a module theoretic setting of the most common results of semi-hereditary rings. Also, we have a characterization of a finite \Sigma-Rickart module in terms of its endomorphism ring. In addition, we introduce M-coherent modules and provide a characterization of finite \Sigma-Rickart modules in terms of M-coherent modules. At the end, we study when \Sigma-Rickart modules and finite \Sigma-Rickart modules coincide. Examples which delineate the concepts and results are provided.
