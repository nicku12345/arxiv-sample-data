The aim of this note is to completely determine the second homology group of the special queer Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{sq}_n(R) coordinatized by a unital associative superalgebra R, which will be achieved via an isomorphism between the special linear Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{sl}_{n}(R\otimes Q_1) and the special queer Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{sq}_n(R).
