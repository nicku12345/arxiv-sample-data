Let R be a commutative ring with 1 and n a natural number. We say that a submodule N of R^n is semiprime if for every f=(f_1,\ldots,f_n) \in R^n such that f_i f \in N for i=1,\ldots,n we have f \in N. Our main result is that every semiprime submodule of R^n is equal to the intersection of all prime submodules containing it. It follows that every semiprime left ideal of M_n(R) is equal to the intersection of all prime left ideals that contain it. For R=k[x_1,\ldots,x_d] where k is an algebraically closed field we can rephrase this result as a Nullstellensatz for M_n(R): For every G_1,\ldots,G_m,F \in M_n(R), F belongs to the smallest semiprime left ideal of M_n(R) that contains G_1,\ldots,G_m iff for every a \in k^d and v \in k^n such that G_1(a)v=\ldots=G_m(a)v=0 we have F(a)v=0.
