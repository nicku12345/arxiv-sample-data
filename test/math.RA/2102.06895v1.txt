In this paper, we define and study the universal enveloping algebra of Poisson superalgebras. In particular, a new PBW theorem for Lie-Rinehart superalgebras is proved, leading to a PBW theorem for Poisson superalgebras; we show the universal enveloping algebra of a Poisson Hopf superalgebra (resp. Poisson-Ore extension) is a Hopf superalgebra (resp. iterated Ore extension); and we determine the universal enveloping algebra for examples such as quadratic polynomial Poisson superalgebras and Poisson symmetric superalgebras.
