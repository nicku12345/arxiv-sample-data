In this paper, we introduce twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators on a Leibniz algebra as a generalization of twisted Poisson structures. We define the cohomology of a twisted relative Rota-Baxter operator K as the Loday-Pirashvili cohomology of a certain Leibniz algebra induced by K with coefficients in a suitable representation. Then we consider formal deformations of twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators from cohomological points of view. Finally, we introduce and study NS-Leibniz algebras as the underlying structure of twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators.
