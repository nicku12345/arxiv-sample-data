Suppose the ground field \mathbb{F} is an algebraically closed field characteristic of p>2. In this paper, we investigate the restricted cohomology theory of restricted Lie superalgebras. Algebraic interpretations of low dimensional restricted cohomology of restricted Lie superalgebra are given. We show that there is a family of restricted model filiform Lie superalgebra L_{p,p}^{\lambda} structures parameterized by elements \lambda\in \mathbb{F}^{p}. We explicitly describe both the 1-dimensional ordinary and restricted cohomology superspaces of L_{p,p}^{\lambda} with coefficients in the 1-dimensional trivial module and show that these superspaces are equal. We also describe the 2-dimensional ordinary and restricted cohomology superspaces of L_{p,p}^{\lambda} with coefficients in the 1-dimensional trivial module and show that these superspaces are unequal.
