In this paper, we introduce an element \phi-\delta-primary to another element in a compactly generated multiplicative lattice L and obtain its characterizations. We prove many of its properties and investigate the relations between these structures. By a counter example, it is shown that if an element b\in L is \phi-\delta-primary to a proper element p\in L then b need not be \delta-primary to p and found conditions under which an element b\in L is \delta-primary to a proper element p\in L if b is \phi-\delta-primary to p.
