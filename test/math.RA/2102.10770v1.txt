In this paper, we give algorithms for determining the existence of isomorphism between two finite-dimensional Lie algebras and compute such an isomorphism in the affirrmative case. We also provide algorithms for determining algebraic relations of parameters in order to decide whether two parameterized Lie algebras are isomorphic. All of the considered Lie algebras are considered over a field \F, where \F=\C or \F=\R. Several illustrative examples are given to show the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
