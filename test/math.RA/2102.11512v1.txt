This paper introduces and studies nil-reversible rings wherein we call a ring R nil-reversible if the left and right annihilators of every nilpotent element of R are equal. Reversible rings (and hence reduced rings) form a proper subclass of nil-reversible rings and hence we provide some conditions for a nil-reversible ring to be reduced. It turns out that nil-reversible rings are abelian, 2-primal, weakly semicommutative and nil-Armendariz. Further, we observe that the polynomial ring over a nil-reversible ring R is not necessarily nil-reversible in general, but it is nil-reversible if R is Armendariz additionally.
