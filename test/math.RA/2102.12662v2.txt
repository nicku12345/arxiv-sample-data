A thin Lie algebras is a Lie algebra L, graded over the positive integers, with its first homogeneous component L_1 of dimension two and generating L, and such that each nonzero ideal of L lies between consecutive terms of its lower central series. All its homogeneous components have dimension one or two, and the two-dimensional components are called diamonds. We prove that if the next diamond past L_1 of an infinite-dimensional thin Lie algebra L is L_k, with k>5, then [Lyy]=0 for some nonzero element y of L_1.
