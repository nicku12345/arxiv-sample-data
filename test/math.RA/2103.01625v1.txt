Evolution algebras with one dimensional square are classified using the theory of inner product spaces. More precisely, for A an evolution algebra with \dim(A^2) = 1 and a a generator of A^2, the product of A is given by xy = \langle x,y\rangle a. Three broad classes of algebras are obtained:   (1) a\in\hbox{Ann}(A);   (2) a\notin\text{Ann}(A) and a is isotropic relative to \langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle;   (3) a\notin\text{Ann}(A) and a is anisotropic relative to \langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle.
