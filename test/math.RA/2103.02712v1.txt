We give a one-to-one correspondence between ideals in the Steinberg algebra of a Hausdorff ample groupoid G, and certain families of ideals in the group algebras of isotropy groups in G. This generalises a known ideal correspondence theorem for Steinberg algebras of strongly effective groupoids. We use this to give a complete graph-theoretic description of the ideal lattice of Leavitt path algebras over arbitrary commutative rings, generalising the classification of ideals in Leavitt path algebras over fields.
