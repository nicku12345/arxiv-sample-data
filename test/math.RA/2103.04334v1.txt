We prove that a Malcev algebra \mathcal{M} containing the 7-dimensional simple non-Lie Malcev algebra \mathbb{M} such that m\mathbb{M}\neq 0 for any m\neq 0 from \mathcal{M}, is isomorphic to \mathbb{M}\otimes_\textup{F} \mathcal{U}, where \mathcal{U} is a certain commutative associative algebra. Also, we prove that a Malcev superalgebra \mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_0\oplus \mathcal{M}_1 whose even part \mathcal{M}_0 contains \mathbb{M} with m\mathbb{M}\neq 0 for any homogeneous element 0\neq m\in \mathcal{M}_0\cup \mathcal{M}_1, is isomorphic to \mathbb{M}\otimes_\textup{F}U, where U is a certain supercommutative associative superalgebra.
