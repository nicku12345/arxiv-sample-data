Let \alpha=(A_g,\alpha_g)_{g\in G} be a group-type partial action of a connected groupoid G on a ring A=\bigoplus_{z\in G_0}A_z and B=A\star_{\alpha}G the corresponding partial skew groupoid ring. In the first part of this paper we investigate the relation of several ring theoretic properties between A and B. For the second part, using that every Leavitt path algebra is isomorphic to a partial skew groupoid ring obtained from a partial groupoid action \lambda, we characterize when \lambda is group-type. In such a case, we obtain ring theoretic properties of Leavitt path algebras from the results on general partial skew groupoid rings. Several examples that illustrate the results on Leavitt path algebras are presented.
