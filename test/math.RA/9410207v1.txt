We consider generalizations of the Vieta formula (relating the coefficients of an algebraic equation to the roots) to the case of equations whose coefficients are order-k matrices.   Specifically, we prove that if X_1,\dots ,X_n are solutions of an algebraic matrix equation X^n+A_1X^{n-1}+\dots +A_n=0, independent in the sense that they determine the coefficients A_1,\dots ,A_n, then the trace of A_1 is the sum of the traces of the X_i, and the determinant of A_n is, up to a sign, the product of the determinants of the X_i. We generalize this to arbitrary rings with appropriate structures.   This result is related to and motivated by some constructions in non-commutative geometry.
