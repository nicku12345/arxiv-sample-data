An algebra A with identity (a\circ b)\circ c-a\circ(b\circ c)=(a\circ c)\circ b-a\circ(c\circ b), is called right-symmetric. Cohomology and deformation theory for right-symmetric algebras are developed. Cohomologies of gl_n and half-Witt algebras W_n^{rsym}, p=0, W_n^{rsym}({\bf m}), p>0, are calculated. In particular, one right-symmetric central extension of W_1^{rsym} is constructed.
