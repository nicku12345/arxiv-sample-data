A necessary and sufficient condition for an element of an algebra (in the sense of Universal Algebra) to be in the dominion of a subalgebra is given, in terms of transferable sets. This criterion is then used to formulate a more wieldy sufficient condition. Finally, some connections to a purely combinatorial setting are outlined.
