An algebra A with multiplication A\times A \to A, (a,b)\mapsto a\circ b, is called right-symmetric, if a\circ(b\circ c)-(a\circ b)\circ a\circ (c\circ b)-(a\circ c)\circ b, for any a,b,c\in A. The multiplication of right-symmetric Witt algebras W_n=\{u\der_i: u\in U, U={\cal K}[x_1^{\pm 1},...,x_n^{\pm} or ={\cal K}[x_1,...,x_n], i=1,...,n\}, p=0, or W_n({\bf m)}=\{u\der_i: u\in U, U=O_n({\bf m})\}, are given by u\der_i\circ v\der_j=v\der_j(u)\der_i. An analogue of the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem for right-symmetric Witt algebras is established. Right-symmetric Witt algebras of  satisfy the standard right-symmetric identity of degree 2n+1: \sum_{\sigma\in Sym_{2n}}sign(\sigma)a_{\sigma(1)}\circ(a_{\sigma(2)}\circ >...(a_{\sigma(2n)}\circ a_{2n+1})...)=0. The minimal deg left polynomial identities of W_n^{rsym}, W_n^{+rsym}, p=0, i The minimal degree of multilinear left polynomial identity of  is also 2n+1. All left polynomial (also multilinear, if p>0) identities of right-symmetric Witt algebras of minimal  combinations of left polynomials obtained from standard ones by permutations of arguments.
