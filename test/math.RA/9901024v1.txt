The mixed verbal wreath product in representations of Lie algebras is a construction parallel to the verbal wreath product of Lie algebras introduced by A. L. Shmelkin. It is shown that the analog of the group theorem on embedding in the verbal wreath product also holds for representations of Lie algebras.
