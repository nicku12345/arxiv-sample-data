A complete description of subgroups in the general linear group over a semilocal ring containing the group of diagonal matrices was obtained by Z.I.Borewicz and N.A.Vavilov. It is shown in the present paper that a similar description holds for the intermediate subgroups of the group of all automorphisms of the lattice of right submodules of a free finite rank R-module over a simple Artinian ring containing the group consisting of those automorphisms which leave invariant an appropriate sublattice.
