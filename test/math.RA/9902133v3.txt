First some old as well as new results about P.I. algebras, Ore extensions, and degrees are presented. Then quantized n\times r matrices as well as quantized factor algebras of M_q(n) are analyzed. The latter are the quantized function algebra of rank r matrices obtained by working modulo the ideal generated by all (r+1)\times (r+1) quantum subdeterminants and a certain localization of this algebra is proved to be isomorphic to a more manageable one. In all cases, the quantum parameter is a primitive mth roots of unity. The degrees and centers of the algebras are determined when m is a prime and the general structure is obtained for arbitrary m.
