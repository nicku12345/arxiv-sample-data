We construct Galois theory for sublattices of certain complete modular lattices and their automorphism groups. A well-known description of the intermediate subgroups of the general linear group over a semilocal ring containing the group of diagonal matrices, due to Z.I.Borewicz and N.A.Vavilov, can be obtained as a consequence of this theory.
