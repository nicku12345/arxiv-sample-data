Let A denote the commutative polynomial ring in n variables, over an algebraically closed field k, and let R denote the standard multiparameter quantization of A determined by a multiplicatively antisymmetric n\times n matrix (q_{ij}). In this paper we prove, when -1 cannot be multiplicatively generated by the q_{ij}, that the primitive spectrum of R is a topological quotient of k^n. Under the same hypothesis, we further prove that the prime spectrum of R is a topological quotient of the prime spectrum of A.
