We construct a birational equivalence between certain quotients of s-tuples of equidimensional linear subspaces of C^n and some quotients of products of square matrices modulo diagonal conjugations. In particular, we prove the rationality of the quotient space of s-tuples of linear 2-planes in C^n modulo the diagonal \gl_n(C)-action . Furthermore, we compute generators of the field of the rational invariants explicitly.
