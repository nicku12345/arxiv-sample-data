We show that if a finite dimensional Hopf algebra over {\bf C} has a basis such that all the structure constants are non-negative, then the Hopf algebra must be given by a finite group G and a factorization G=G_+G_- into two subgroups. We also show that Hopf algebras in the category of finite sets with correspondences as morphisms are classified in the similar way. Our results can be used to explain some results in Hopf algebras from set-theoretical viewpoint.
