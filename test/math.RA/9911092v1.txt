A basis B of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra H is said to be positive if all the structure constants of H relative to B are non-negative. A quasi-triangular structure R\in H\otimes H is said to be positive with respect to B if it has non-negative coefficients in the basis B \otimes B of H\otimes H. In our earlier work, we have classified all finite dimensional Hopf algebras with positive bases. In this paper, we classify positive quasi-triangular structures on such Hopf algebras. A consequence of this classification is a new way of constructing set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.
