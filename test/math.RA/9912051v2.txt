In the noncommutative geometry of Artin, Van den Bergh, and others, the twisted homogeneous coordinate ring is one of the basic constructions. Such a ring is defined by a \sigma-ample divisor, where \sigma is an automorphism of a projective scheme X. Many open questions regarding \sigma-ample divisors have remained.   We derive a relatively simple necessary and sufficient condition for a divisor on X to be \sigma-ample. As a consequence, we show right and left \sigma-ampleness are equivalent and any associated noncommutative homogeneous coordinate ring must be noetherian and have finite, integral GK-dimension. We also characterize which automorphisms \sigma yield a \sigma-ample divisor.
