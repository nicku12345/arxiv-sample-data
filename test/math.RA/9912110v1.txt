Given an affine algebraic variety V and a quantization A of its coordinate ring, it is conjectured that the primitive ideal space of A can be expressed as a topological quotient of V. Evidence in favor of this conjecture is discussed, and positive solutions for several types of varieties (obtained in joint work with E. S. Letzter) are described. In particular, explicit topological quotient maps are given in the case of quantum toric varieties.
