The Kronecker product of two Schur functions s_{\mu} and s_{\nu}, denoted by s_{\mu}*s_{\nu}, is the Frobenius characteristic of the tensor product of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group corresponding to the partitions \mu and \nu. The coefficient of s_{\lambda} in this product is denoted by \gamma^{\lambda}_{{\mu}{\nu}}, and corresponds to the multiplicity of the irreducible character \chi^{\lambda} in \chi^{\mu}\chi^{\nu}.   We use Sergeev's Formula for a Schur function of a difference of two alphabets and the comultiplication expansion for s_{\lambda}[XY] to find closed formulas for the Kronecker coefficients \gamma^{\lambda}_{{\mu}{\nu}} when \lambda is an arbitrary shape and \mu and \nu are hook shapes or two-row shapes.   Remmel \cite{Re1, Re2} and Remmel and Whitehead \cite{Re-Wh} derived some closed formulas for the Kronecker product of Schur functions indexed by two-row shapes or hook shapes using a different approach. We believe that the approach of this paper is more natural. The formulas obtained are simpler and reflect the symmetry of the Kronecker product.
