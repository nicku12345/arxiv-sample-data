A well-known result of Kostant gives a description of the G-module structure for the exterior algebra of Lie algebra \frak g. We give a generalization of this result for the isotropy representations of symmetric spaces. If \frak g={\frak g}_0+{\frak g_1} is a Z_2-grading of a simple Lie algebra, we explicitly describe a {\frak g}_0-module Spin_0({\frak g}_1) such that the exterior algebra of {\frak g}_1 is the tensor square of this module times some power of 2. Although Spin_0({\frak g}_1) is usually reducible, we show that a Casimir element for {\frak g}_0 always acts scalarly on it.   We also a give classification of all orthogonal representations of simple algebraic groups having an exterior algebra of skew-invariants.
