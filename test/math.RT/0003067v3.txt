In this paper we use the concept of wavelet sets as introduced by X. Dai and D. Larson, to decompose the wavelet representation of the discrete group associated to an arbitrary n \times n integer dilation matrix as a direct integral of irreducible monomial representations. In so doing we generalize a result of F. Martin and A. Valette in which they show that the wavelet representation is weakly equivalent to the regular representation for the Baumslag-Solitar groups.
