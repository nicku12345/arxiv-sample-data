The lack of a p-adic Haar measure causes many methods of traditional representation theory to break down when applied to continuous representations of a compact p-adic Lie group G in Banach spaces over a given p-adic field K. For example, Diarra showed that the abelian group G=\dZ has an enormous wealth of infinite dimensional, topologically irreducible Banach space representations.   We therefore address the problem of finding an additional ''finiteness'' condition on such representations that will lead to a reasonable theory. We introduce such a condition that we call ''admissibility''. We show that the category of all admissible G-representations is reasonable -- in fact, it is abelian and of a purely algebraic nature -- by showing that it is anti-equivalent to the category of all finitely generated modules over a certain kind of completed group ring K[[G]].   As an application of our methods we determine the topological irreducibility as well as the intertwining maps for representations of GL_2(\dZ) obtained by induction of a continuous character from the subgroup of lower triangular matrices.
