The fermionic formula conjectured by Kirillov and Reshetikhin describes the decomposition (as a module for U_q(\frak g)) of a tensor product of multiples of of fundamental representations W(m\lambda_i) of the corresponding quantum affine algebras. In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for the modules W(m\lambda_i), if i is such that the corresponding simple root occurs in the highest root of the simple Lie algebra with multiplicity at most 2. In particular, the conjecture is established for all but a few nodes for the exceptional algebras.
