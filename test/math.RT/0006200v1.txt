Let G be a connected Lie group and \hat G its unitary dual. We are interested in the part \Lambda\subset\hat G which corresponds to the unitary highest weight representations of G. Then there are several topologies on \Lambda: The euclidean topology T_E which comes from the identification of \Lambda with the set of highest weights, the induced topology T_I induced from the Fell topology on \hat G and finally a natural topology T_S which comes from the hull kernel topology of certain CCR C^*-algebras which are related to the holomorphic extemsion of unitary highest weight representations to complex Olshanskii semigroups S. One of the main results in this paper is the inclusion chain T_S\subset T_I\subset T_E. Further we exhibit very large interesting subspaces of \Lambda where these topologies coincide. Finally we show that the Borel structures on \Lambda induced from the three different topologies coincide.
