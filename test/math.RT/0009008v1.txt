Let K be a field of characteristic p and G a nonabelian metacyclic finite p-group. We give an explicit list of all metacyclic p-groups G, such that the group algebra KG over a field of characteristic p has a filtered multiplicative K-basis. We also present an example of a non-metacyclic 2-group G, such that the group algebra KG over any field of characteristic 2 has a filtered multiplicative K-basis.
