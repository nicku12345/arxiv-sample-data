Let Y=\Gamma\backslash H^n be a quotient of the hyperbolic space by the action of a discrete convex-cocompact group of isometries. We describe certain spaces of \Gamma-invariant currents on the sphere at infinity of H^n with support on the limit set of \Gamma. These spaces are finite-dimensional. The main result identifies the cohomology of Y with a quotient of such spaces. We explain in which sense this result generalizes the classical Hodge theorem for compact quotients. We obtain analogous results for the cohomology groups H^p(\Gamma,F), where F is a finite-dimensional representation of the full group of orientation preserving isometries of H^n.
