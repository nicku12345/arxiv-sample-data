Let g be a complex, simple Lie algebra and t a Cartan subalgebra of g. A new unitary, flat connection on t with values in any finite-dimensional g-module V and simple poles along the root hyperplanes was recently introduced by J. Millson and myself. This connection depends upon a complex parameter h and I conjectured that its monodromy is equivalent to the quantum Weyl group representation of the braid group of type g defined by Lusztig, Kirillov-Reshetikhin and Soibelman via the quantum group U_{h}g. In this paper, I prove this conjecture for g=sl_{n}.
