A general method for the determination of the harmonics of quotients of the 3-sphere is given. They can all be deduced from three objects already known from Klein. We further show explicitly how these harmonics can be organized in irreducible representations of the holonomy group: this allows for the determination of the full correlation matrix of the Cosmic Microwave Background in the spherical harmonics basis.
