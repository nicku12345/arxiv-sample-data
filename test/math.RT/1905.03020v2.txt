We consider the adjoint representation of a Hopf algebra H focusing on the locally finite part, H_{\text{adfin}}, defined as the sum of all finite-dimensional subrepresentations. For virtually cocommutative H (i.e., H is finitely generated as module over a cocommutative Hopf subalgebra), we show that H_{\text{adfin}} is a Hopf subalgebra of H. This is a consequence of the fact, proved here, that locally finite parts yield a tensor functor on the module category of any virtually pointed Hopf algebra. For general Hopf algebras, H_{\text{adfin}} is shown to be a left coideal subalgebra. We also prove a version of Dietzmann's Lemma from group theory for Hopf algebras.
