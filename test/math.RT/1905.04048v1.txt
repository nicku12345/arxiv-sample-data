Let k be a field and q a non-zero element of k. In Part I, we have exhibited a 6-dimensional k-algebra A = A(q) and we have shown that if q has infinite multiplicative order, then A has a 3-dimensional local module which is semi-Gorenstein-projective, but not torsionless, thus not Gorenstein-projective. This Part II is devoted to a detailed study of all the 3-dimensional local A-modules for this particular algebra A. If q has infinite multiplicative order, we will encounter a whole family of 3-dimensional local modules which are semi-Gorenstein-projective, but not torsionless.
