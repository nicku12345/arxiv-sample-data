We investigate the categories of finite-dimensional representations of multicurrent and multiloop hyperalgebras in positive characteristic, i.e., the hyperalgebras associated to the multicurrent algebras \mathfrak g\otimes\mathbb{C}[t_1,\ldots,t_n] and to the multiloop algebras \mathfrak g\otimes\mathbb{C}[t_1^{\pm1},\ldots,t_n^{\pm 1}], where \mathfrak g is any finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra. The main results are the construction of the universal finite-dimensional highest-weight modules and a classification of irreducible modules in each category. In the characteristic zero setting we also provide a relationship between them.
