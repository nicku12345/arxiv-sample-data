We initiate the representation theory of the degenerate affine periplectic Brauer algebra on n strands by constructing its finite-dimensional calibrated representations when n=2. We show that any such representation that is indecomposable and does not factor through a representation of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra occurs as an extension of two semisimple representations with one-dimensional composition factors; and furthermore, we classify such representations with regular eigenvalues up to isomorphism.
