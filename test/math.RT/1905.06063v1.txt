When using the generally adopted definition of a super unitary representation, there are lots of super Lie groups for which the regular representation is not super unitary. I propose a new definition of a super unitary representation for which all regular representations are super unitary. I then choose a particular super Lie group (of Heisenberg type) for which I provide a list of super unitary representations in my new sense, obtained by a heuristic super orbit method. The super orbit challenge is to find a well defined {super orbit method} that will reproduces more or less my list of super unitary representations (or explains why they should not appear).
