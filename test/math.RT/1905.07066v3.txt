In this paper, we propose a conjectural multiplicity formula for general spherical varieties. For all the cases where a multiplicity formula has been proved, including Whittaker model, Gan-Gross-Prasad model, Ginzburg-Rallis model, Galois model and Shalika model, we show that the multiplicity formula in our conjecture matches the multiplicity formula that has been proved. We also give a proof of this multiplicity formula in two new cases.
