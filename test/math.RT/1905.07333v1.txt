Let \ell\in\mathbb{N} with \ell>2 and I:=\mathbb{Z}/2\ell\mathbb{Z}. In this paper we give a new realization of the crystal of affine \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{\ell} using the modular representation theory of the affine Hecke algebras H_n of type A and their level two cyclotomic quotients with Hecke parameter being a primitive 2\ellth root of unity. We categorify the Kashiwara operators for the crystal as the functors of taking socle of certain two-steps restriction and of taking head of certain two-steps induction. For any finite dimensional irreducible H_n-module M, we prove that the irreducible submodules of \rm{res}_{H_{n-2}}^{H_n}M which belong to \widehat{B}(\infty) (Definition 6.1) occur with multiplicity two. The main results generalize the earlier work of Grojnowski and Vazirani on the relations between the crystal of affine \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{\ell} and the affine Hecke algebras of type A at a primitive \ellth root of unity.
