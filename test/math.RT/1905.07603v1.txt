The Whittaker module M_{\psi} and its quotient Whittaker module L_{\psi, \xi} for the twisted affine Nappi-Witten Lie algebra \widehat{H}_{4}[\tau] are studied. For nonsingular type, it is proved that if \xi\neq 0, then L_{\psi,\xi} is irreducible and any irreducible Whittaker \widehat{H}_{4}[\tau]-module of type \psi with {\bf k} acting as a non-zero scalar \xi is isomorphic to L_{\psi,\xi}. Furthermore, for \xi=0, all Whittaker vectors of L_{\psi, 0} are completely determined. For singular type, the Whittaker vectors of L_{\psi, \xi} with \xi \neq 0 are fully characterized.
