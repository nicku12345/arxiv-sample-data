We use the theta lifts between Mp(2) and PD to study the distinction problems for the pair (Mp(2,E), SL(2,F )), where E is a quadratic field extension over a nonarchimedean local field F of characteristic zero and D is a quaternion algebra. With a similar strategy, we give a conjectural formula for the multiplicity of distinction problem related to the pair (Mp(2n,E),Sp(2n,F)).
