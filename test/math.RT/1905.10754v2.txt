Let G be a simple, simply connected algebraic group of exceptional type defined over \mathbb{F}_q with Frobenius endomorphism F: G \to G. Let \ell \nmid q be a good prime for G. We determine the number of irreducible Brauer characters in the quasi-isolated \ell-blocks of G^F. This is done by proving that generalized e-Harish-Chandra theory holds for the Lusztig series associated to quasi-isolated elements of G^{*F}.
