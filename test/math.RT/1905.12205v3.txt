Let E/F be a quadratic extension of fields, and G a connected quasi-split reductive group over F. Let G^{op} be the opposition group obtained by twisting G by the duality involution considered by Prasad. Assume that the field F is finite. Let \pi be an irreducible generic representation of G(E). When \pi is a Shintani base change lift of some representation of G^{op}(F), we give an explicit nonzero G(F)-invariant vector in terms of the Whittaker vector of \pi. This shows particularly that \pi is G(F)-distinguished.   When the field F is p-adic, the paper also proves that the duality involution takes an irreducible admissible generic representation of G(F) to its contragredient. As a special case of this result, all generic representations of G_2,\ F_4 or E_8 are self-dual.
