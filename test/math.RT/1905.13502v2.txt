In this paper, we will determine the factorization of global period attached to the spherical variety X:=\mathrm{SO}(n-1)\backslash \mathrm{SO}(n), which is a special case of the Sakellaridis-Venkatesh conjecture. The main idea is to build a connection between the periods of X and the periods of the Whittaker case N,\psi\backslash \mathrm{SL}_2 (n even) or N,\psi\backslash \mathrm{Mp}_2 (n odd) using the tool of theta correspondence. In the local setting, we determine the Plancherel formula of L^2(X), the relative character identities and give an explicite integral formula of transfer between X-side and Whittaker-side which coincides with the theory of transfer developed by Sakellaridis.
