We study the characters of simple modules in the parabolic BGG category of the affine Lie algebra in Deligne's category. More specifically, we take the limit of Weyl-Kac formula to compute the character of the irreducible quotient L(X,k) of the parabolic Verma module M(X,k) of level k, where X is an indecomposable object of Deligne's category \underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(GL_t), \underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(O_t), or \underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(Sp_t), under conditions that the highest weight of X plus the level gives a fundamental weight, t is transcendental, and the base field \Bbbk has characteristic 0. We compare our result to the partial result of Etingof, and evaluate the characters to the categorical dimensions to get a categorical interpretation of the Nekrasov-Okounkov hook length formula.
