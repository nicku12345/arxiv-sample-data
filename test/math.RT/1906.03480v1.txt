Let G be a connected and simply connected complex semisimple Lie group. For a collection of homogeneous G-spaces G/Q, we construct a finite atlas {\mathcal{A}}_{\rm BS}(G/Q) on G/Q, called the Bott-Samelson atlas, and we prove that all of its coordinate functions are positive with respect to the Lusztig positive structure on G/Q. We also show that the standard Poisson structure \pi_{G/Q} on G/Q is presented, in each of the coordinate charts of {\mathcal{A}}_{\rm BS}(G/Q), as a symmetric Poisson CGL extension (or a certain localization thereof) in the sense of Goodearl-Yakimov, making (G/Q, \pi_{G/Q}, {\mathcal{A}}_{\rm BS}(G/Q)) into a Poisson-Ore variety. Examples of G/Q include G itself, G/T, G/B, and G/N, where T \subset G is a maximal torus, B \subset G a Borel subgroup, and N the uniradical of B.
