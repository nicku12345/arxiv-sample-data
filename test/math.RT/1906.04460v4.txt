Let G be a connected semisimple algebraic group of adjoint type defined over an algebraically closed field K of positive characteristic. The characteristic p is very good for G when p is suitably large and, if G is of type A_n, p does not divide n+1. The majority of results concerning the geometric structure of algebraic groups in positive characteristic are valid only in very good characteristic. We demonstrate that the dual nilcone \mathcal{N}^* \subseteq \mathfrak{g}^* is a normal variety in certain characteristics which are not very good for G. As an application, we extend the results of Ardakov and Wadsley on representations of p-adic Lie groups. Under further restrictions on the characteristic, we show that the canonical dimension of a coadmissible representation of a semisimple p-adic Lie group in a p-adic Banach space is either zero or at least half the dimension of a nonzero coadjoint orbit.
