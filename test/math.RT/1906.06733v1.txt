J. Pevtsova and the author constructed a ``universal p-nilpotent operator" for an infinitesimal group scheme G over a field k of characteristic p > 0 which led to coherent sheaves on the scheme of 1-parameter subgroups of G associated to a G-module M. Of special interest is the fact that these coherent sheaves are vector bundles if M is of constant Jordan type. In this paper, we provide similar invariants for a finite group \tau which recover the invariants earlier obtained for elementary abelian p-groups. To do this, we replace the analogue of 1-parameter subgroups by a refined version of equivalence classes of \pi-points for k\tau. More generally, we provide a construction of vector bundles for the semi-direct product G\rtimes \tau of an infinitesimal group scheme G and a finite group \tau.   A major motivation for this study is to further our understanding of the relationship between representations of \mathbb G(\mathbb F_p) and \mathbb G_{(r)} associated to a finite dimensional rational \mathbb G-module M, where \mathbb G is a reductive group with r-th Fobenius kernel \mathbb G_{(r)}. Using vector bundles, we extend and sharpen earlier results comparing support varieties.
