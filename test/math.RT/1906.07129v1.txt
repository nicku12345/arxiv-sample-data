In this paper, we construct a family of non-weight modules over the super-Virasoro algebras. Those modules when regarded as modules of the Ramond algebra and further restricted as modules over the Cartan subalgebra \mathfrak{h} are free of rank 1, while when regarded as modules of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra and further restricted as modules over the Cartan subalgebra \mathfrak{H} are free of rank 2. We obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for such modules to be simple. Moreover, we determine the isomorphism classes of these modules. Finally, we show that these modules constitute a complete classification of free U(\mathfrak{h})-modules of rank 1 over the super-Virasoro algebra of Ramond type, and also constitute a complete classification of free U(\mathfrak{H})-modules of rank 2 over the super-Virasoro algebra of Neveu-Schwarz type.
