We construct an infinite tower of irreducible calibrated representations of periplectic Brauer algebras on which the cup-cap generators act by nonzero matrices. As representations of the symmetric group, these are exterior powers of the standard representation (i.e. hook representations). Our approach uses the recently-defined degenerate affine periplectic Brauer algebra, which plays a role similar to that of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra in representation theory of the symmetric group. We write formulas for the representing matrices in the basis of Jucys--Murphy eigenvectors and we completely describe the spectrum of these representations. The tower formed by these representations provides a new, non-semisimple categorification of Pascal's triangle. Along the way, we also prove some basic results about calibrated representations of the degenerate affine periplectic Brauer algebra.
