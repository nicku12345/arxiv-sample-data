Given a connected reductive algebraic group G over a finite field together with a representation of the dual group of G in GL(n), Braverman and Kazhdan defined an exotic Fourier operator on the space of complex valued functions on the finite group of rational points of G. In these notes we give an explicit formula for the Fourier kernel and a geometrical interpretation of this formula (as conjectured by Braverman and Kazhdan under some assumption).
