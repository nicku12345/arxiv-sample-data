A real representation \pi of a finite group may be regarded as a homomorphism to an orthogonal group \Or(V). For symmetric groups S_n, alternating groups A_n, and products S_n \times S_{n'} of symmetric groups, we give criteria for whether \pi lifts to the double cover \Pin(V) of \Or(V), in terms of character values. From these criteria, we compute the second Stiefel-Whitney classes of these representations.
