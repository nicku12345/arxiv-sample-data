We give examples of finite-dimensional algebras A for which the silting objects in K^b(\mbox{proj-}A) are not connected by any sequence of (possibly reducible) silting mutations. The argument is based on the fact that silting mutation preserves invariance under twisting by a fixed algebra automorphism, combined with the existence of spherical modules that are not invariant under such a twist.
