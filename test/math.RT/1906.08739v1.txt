For a symmetrizable GCM C and its symmetrizer D, Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer [Invent. Math. 209 (2017)] has introduced a generalized preprojective algebra \Pi associated to C and D, that contains a class of modules, called locally free modules. We show that any basic support \tau-tilting \Pi-module is locally free and gives a classification theorem of torsion-free classes in \operatorname{\mathbf{rep}}{\Pi} as the generalization of the work of Mizuno [Math. Z. 277 (2014)].
