Relying on work of Kashiwara-Schapira and Schmid-Vilonen, we describe the behaviour of characteristic cycles with respect to the operation of geometric induction, the geometric counterpart of taking parabolic or cohomological induction in representation theory. By doing this, we are able to describe the characteristic cycle associated to an induced representation in terms of the characteristic cycle of the representation being induced.
