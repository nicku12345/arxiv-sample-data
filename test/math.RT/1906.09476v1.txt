We introduce and study the category of twisted modules over a triangular differential graded bocs. We show that in this category idempotents split, that it admits a natural structure of a Frobenius category, that a twisted module is homotopically trivial if and only if its underlying complex is acyclic, and that any homotopy equivalence of differential graded bocses determines an equivalence of the corresponding homotopy categories of twisted modules. The category of modules over an A_{\infty}-algebra is equivalent to the category of twisted modules over a triangular differential graded bocs, so all preceding statements lift to the former category.
