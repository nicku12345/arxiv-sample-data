Let G=SL_n(\mathbb C) and T be a maximal torus in G. We show that the quotient T \backslash \backslash G/{P_{\alpha_1}\cap P_{\alpha_2}} is projectively normal with respect to the descent of a suitable line bundle, where P_{\alpha_i} is the maximal parabolic subgroup in G associated to the simple root \alpha_i, i=1,2. We give a degree bound of the generators of the homogeneous coordinate ring of T \backslash \backslash (G_{3,6})^{ss}_T(\mathcal{L}_{2\varpi_3}). If G =Spin_7, we give a degree bound of the generators of the homogeneous coordinate ring of T \backslash \backslash (G/P_{\alpha_2})^{ss}_T(\mathcal{L}_{2\varpi_2}) whereas we prove that the quotient T\backslash\backslash (G/P_{\alpha_3})^{ss}_T(\mathcal{L}_{4\varpi_3}) is projectively normal with respect to the descent of the line bundles \mathcal{L}_{4\varpi_3}.
