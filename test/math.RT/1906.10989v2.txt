Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu as a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories. A notion of proper class in an extriangulated category is defined in this paper. Let \mathcal{C} be an extriangulated category and \xi a proper class in \mathcal{C}. We prove that \mathcal{C} admits a new extriangulated structure. This construction gives extriangulated categories which are neither exact categories nor triangulated categories. Moreover, we introduce and study \xi-Gorenstein projective objects in \mathcal{C} and demonstrate that \xi-Gorenstein projective objects share some basic properties with Gorenstein projective objects in module categories or in triangulated categories. In particular, we refine a result of Asadollahi and Salarian [Gorenstein objects in triangulated categories, J. Algebra 281(2004), 264-286]. As an application, the \xi-\mathcal{G}projective model structures on extriangulated categories are obtained.
