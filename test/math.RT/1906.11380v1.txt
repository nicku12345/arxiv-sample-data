Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras R_\theta of finite Lie type are affine quasihereditary with standard modules \Delta(\pi) labeled by Kostant partitions of \theta. Let \Delta be the direct sum of all standard modules. It is known that the Yoneda algebra \mathcal{E}_\theta:=\operatorname{Ext}_{R_\theta}^*(\Delta, \Delta) carries a structure of an A_\infty-algebra which can be used to reconstruct the category of standardly filtered R_\theta-modules. In this paper, we explicitly describe \mathcal{E}_\theta in two special cases: (1) when \theta is a positive root in type \mathtt{A}, and (2) when \theta is of Lie type \mathtt{A_2}. In these cases, \mathcal{E}_\theta turns out to be torsion free and intrinsically formal. We provide an example to show that the A_\infty-algebra \mathcal{E}_\theta is non-formal in general.
