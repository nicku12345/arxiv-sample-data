This paper is meant to be an informative introduction to spinor representations of Clifford algebras. In this paper we will have a look at Clifford algebras and the octonion algebra. We begin the paper looking at the quaternion algebra \mathbb{H} and basic properties that relate Clifford algebras and the well know Pin and Spin groups. We then will look at generalized spinor representations of Clifford algebras, along with many examples. We conclude the paper looking at the octonion algebra \mathbb{O}. This paper provides background to constructing representations which can be used to look at elements in the appropriate Pin and Spin groups.
