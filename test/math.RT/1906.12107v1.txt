In this paper, we study a class of infinite simple Lie conformal algebras associated to a class of generalized Block type Lie algebras. The central extensions, conformal derivations and free intermediate series modules of this class of Lie conformal algebras are determined. Moreover, we also show that these Lie conformal algebras do not have any non-trivial finite conformal modules. Consequently, these Lie conformal algebras cannot be embedded into gc_N for any positive integer N.
