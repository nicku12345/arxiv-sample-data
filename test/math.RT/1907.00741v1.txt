Let {\bf G} be a connected reductive group defined over the finite field \mathbb{F}_q of q elements, and {\bf B} be a Borel subgroup of {\bf G} defined over \mathbb{F}_q. We show that the abstract induced module \mathbb{M}(\theta)=\Bbbk{\bf G}\otimes_{\Bbbk{\bf B}}\theta (here \Bbbk{\bf H} is the group algebra of {\bf H} over the field \Bbbk) has a composition series (of finite length) if the characteristic of \Bbbk is not equal to that of \mathbb{F}_q. In the case \Bbbk=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q and \theta is a rational character, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the composition series (of finite length) of \mathbb{M}(\theta). We determine all the composition factors whenever the composition series exist. This gives a large class of abstract infinite dimensional irreducible \Bbbk{\bf G}-modules.
