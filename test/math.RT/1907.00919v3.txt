We compare crystal combinatorics of the level 2 Fock space with the classification of unitary representations of type B rational Cherednik algebras to show that any finite-dimensional unitary irreducible representation of such an algebra is labeled by a bipartition consisting of a rectangular partition in one component and the empty partition in the other component. This is a new proof of a result that can be deduced from theorems of Montarani and Etingof-Stoica.
