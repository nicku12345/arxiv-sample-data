Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra over the real numbers. We describe an explicit combinatorial construction of the real Weyl group of g with respect to a given Cartan subalgebra. An efficient computation of this Weyl group is important for the classification of regular semisimple subalgebras, real carrier algebras, and real nilpotent orbits associated with g; the latter have various applications in theoretical physics.
