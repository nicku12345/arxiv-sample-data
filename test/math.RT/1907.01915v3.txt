In this paper, we present a method to construct new stable equivalences of Morita type. Suppose that a stable equivalence of Morita type between finite dimensional algebras A and B is defined by a B-A-bimodule N. Then, for any finite admissible set \Phi of natural numbers and any generator X of the A-module category, the \Phi-Beilinson-Green algebras \scr G^{\Phi}_A(X) and \scr G^{\Phi}_B(N\otimes_AX) are stably equivalent of Morita type. In particular, if \Phi=\{0\}, we get a known result in literature. As another consequence, we construct an infinite family of derived equivalent algebras of the same dimension and of the same dominant dimension such that they are pairwise not stably equivalent of Morita type. Finally, we will prove that, if there is a graded stable equivalence of Morita type between graded algebras, then we can get a stable equivalence of Morita type between Beilinson-Green algebras associated with graded algebras
