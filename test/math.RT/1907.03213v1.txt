Our purpose is to give new proofs of several known results about perturbations of matrix pencils. Andrzej Pokrzywa (1986) described the closure of orbit of a Kronecker canonical pencil A-\lambda B in terms of inequalities with pencil invariants. In more detail, Pokrzywa described all Kronecker canonical pencils K-\lambda L such that each neighborhood of A-\lambda B contains a pencil whose Kronecker canonical form is K-\lambda L. Another solution of this problem was given by Klaus Bongartz (1996) by methods of representation theory.   We give a direct and constructive proof of Pokrzywa's theorem. We reduce its proof to the cases of matrices under similarity and of matrix pencils P-\lambda Q that are direct sums of two indecomposable Kronecker canonical pencils. We calculate the Kronecker forms of all pencils in a neighborhood of such a pencil P-\lambda Q. In fact, we calculate the Kronecker forms of only those pencils that belong to a miniversal deformation of P-\lambda Q, which is sufficient since all pencils in a neighborhood of P-\lambda Q are reduced to them by smooth strict equivalence transformations.
