We introduce the principal representation category \mathscr{O}({\bf G}) of reductive algebraic groups with Frobenius maps and put forward a conjecture that this category is a highest weight category. When \Bbbk is complex field \mathbb{C}, we provide some evidences of this conjecture. We also study certain kind of bound quiver algebras whose representations are related to the principal representation category \mathscr{O}({\bf G}) .
