Let \mathscr{B}_0(\mathcal{G})\subseteq k\mathcal{G} be the principal block algebra of the group algebra k\mathcal{G} of an infinitesimal group scheme \mathcal{G} over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic {\rm char}(k)=:p\geq 3. We calculate the restricted Lie algebra structure of the first Hochschild cohomology \mathcal{L}:={\rm H}^1(\mathscr{B}_0(\mathcal{G}),\mathscr{B}_0(\mathcal{G})) whenever \mathscr{B}_0(\mathcal{G}) has finite representation type. As a consequence, we prove that the complexity of the trivial \mathcal{G}-module k coincides with the maximal toral rank of \mathcal{L}.
