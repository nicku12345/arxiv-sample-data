Using translation from the regular block, we construct and analyze properties of BGG complexes in singular blocks of BGG category {\mathcal{O}}. We provide criteria, in terms of the Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials, for such complexes to be exact. In the Koszul dual picture, exactness of BGG complexes is expressed as a certain condition on a generalized Verma flag of an indecomposable projective object in the corresponding block of parabolic category {\mathcal{O}}.   In the second part of the paper, we construct BGG complexes in a more general setting of balanced quasi-hereditary algebras and show how our results for singular blocks can be used to construct BGG resolutions of simple modules in {\mathcal{S}}-subcategories in {\mathcal{O}}.
