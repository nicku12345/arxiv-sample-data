Let \mathfrak{g} be a complex semisimple Lie algebra, \mathfrak{b} be a Borel subalgebra of \mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{n} be the nilradical of \mathfrak{b}, and U(\mathfrak{n}) be the universal enveloping algebra of \mathfrak{n}. We study primitive ideals of U(\mathfrak{n}). Almost all primitive ideals are centrally generated, i.e., are generated by their intersections with the center Z(\mathfrak{n}) of U(\mathfrak{n}). We present an explicit characterization of the centrally generated primitive ideals of U(\mathfrak{n}) in terms of the Dixmier map and the Kostant cascade in the case when \mathfrak{g} is a simple algebra of exceptional type. (For classical simple Lie algebras, a similar characterization was obtained by Ivan Penkov and the first author.) As a corollary, we establish a classification of centrally generated primitive ideals of U(\mathfrak{n}) for an arbitrary semisimple algebra \mathfrak{g}.
