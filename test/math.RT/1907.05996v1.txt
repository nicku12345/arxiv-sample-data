We study Harish-Chandra bimodules for the rational Cherednik algebra associated to the symmetric group S_{n}. In particular, we show that for any parameter c \in \mathbb{C}, the category of Harish-Chandra H_{c}-bimodules admits a fully faithful embedding into the category \mathcal{O}_{c}, and describe the irreducibles in the image. We also construct a duality on the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules, and in fact we do this in a greater generality of quantizations of Nakajima quiver varieties. We use this duality, along with induction and restriction fucntors, to describe as an abelian category the block of the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules containing the regular bimodule.
