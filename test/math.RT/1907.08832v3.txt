In this paper we study the representations of loop Affine-Virasoro Algebras. As they have canonical triangular decomposition, we define Verma modules and its irreducible quotients. We give necessary and sufficient condition for an irreducible highest weight module to have finite dimensional weight spaces. We prove that an irreducible integrable module is either an highest weight module or a lowest weight module whenever the canonical central element acts non trivially. At the end we construct Affine central operators for each integer and they commute with the action of the Affine Lie Algebra.
