Let \mathbb{k} be an algebraically closed field of characteristic  p>0.  In this short note, we illustrate a class of Lie superalgebras over  \mathbb{k}  such that the category of restricted supermodules is of one block. As an application, if  p>3  and  \mathfrak{g}  is a graded restricted Cartan type Lie superalgebra of type W, S and H, then the category of restricted  \mathfrak{g}  supermodules is of one block.
