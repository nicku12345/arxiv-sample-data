Let  W(n)  be Jacobson-Witt algebra over algebraic closed field  \mathbb{K}  with positive characteristic  p>2.  It is difficult to classify all Borel subalgebras of  W(n)  or non-classical restricted simple Lie algebras. The present paper and \cite{S7} study two kinds of subalgebras which are easily to understand and highly related to Borel subalgebras.   In \cite{S7}, the last author investigates a class of special Borel subalgebras of W(n) which is called homogeneous Borel subalgebras. The present paper focuses on subalgebras of  W(n)  which are related to Borel subalgebras such that firstly, they could be trigonalizable; and secondly, they essentially belong to the ones investigated in \cite{S7}. In this paper, the conjugation classes of these subalgebras and representative for each class will be determined. Then some properties such as filtration and dimension will be investigated.
