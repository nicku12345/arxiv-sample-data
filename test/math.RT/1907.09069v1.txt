In this paper, we show that the Dirac cohomology H_{D}(L(\lambda)) of a simple highest weight module L(\lambda) in \mathcal{O}^\mathfrak{p} can be parameterized by a specific set of weights: a subset \mathcal{W}_I(\lambda) of the orbit of the Weyl group W acting on \lambda+\rho. As an application, we show that any simple module in \mathcal{O}^\mathfrak{p} is determined up to isomorphism by its Dirac cohomology. We describe four parameterizations of H_D(L(\lambda)) when \lambda is regular. Two of these parameterizations are geometric in terms of a partial ordering on the dual of the Cartan subalgebra and a generalization of strong linkage, respectively. Using these geometric parameterizations, we derive two algebraic parameterizations in terms of the multiplicities of the composition factors of a Verma module and the embeddings between Verma modules, respectively. As an application, for Verma modules with regular infinitesimal character, we obtain an extended version of the Verma-BGG Theorem. We also investigate Dirac cohomology of Kostant modules. Using Dirac cohomology, we give a new proof of the simplicity criterion for Verma modules and describe a new simplicity criterion for parabolic Verma modules with regular infinitesimal character.
