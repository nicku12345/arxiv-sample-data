In this paper, we give a complete picture of Howe correspondence for the setting (O(E, b), Pin(E, b), \Pi), where O(E, b) is an orthogonal group (real or complex), Pin(E, b) is the two-fold Pin-covering of O(E, b), and \Pi is the spinorial representation of Pin(E, b). More precisely, for a dual pair (G, G') in O(E, b), we determine explicitly the nature of its preimages (\tilde{G}, \tilde{G'}) in Pin(E, b), and prove that apart from some exceptions, (\tilde{G}, \tilde{G'}) is always a dual pair in Pin(E, b); then we establish the Howe correspondence for \Pi with respect to (\tilde{G}, \tilde{G'}).
