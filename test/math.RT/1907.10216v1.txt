We introduce a simple, self-dual, rational, and C_2-cofinite vertex operator algebra of CFT-type associated with a \mathbb{Z}_k-code for k \ge 2 based on the \mathbb{Z}_k-symmetry among the simple current modules for the parafermion vertex operator algebra K(\mathfrak{sl}_2,k). We show that it is naturally realized as the commutant of a certain subalgebra in a lattice vertex operator algebra. Furthermore, we construct all the irreducible modules inside a module for the lattice vertex operator algebra.
