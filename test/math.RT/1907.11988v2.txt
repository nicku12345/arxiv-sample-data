We show that any Abelian module category over the (degenerate or quantum) Heisenberg category satisfying suitable finiteness conditions may be viewed as a 2-representation over a corresponding Kac-Moody 2-category (and vice versa). This gives a way to construct Kac-Moody actions in many representation-theoretic examples which is independent of Rouquier's original approach via `control by K_0.' As an application, we prove an isomorphism theorem for generalized cyclotomic quotients of these categories, extending the known isomorphism between cyclotomic quotients of type A affine Hecke algebras and quiver Hecke algebras.
