The spaces of quasi-invariant polynomials were introduced by Chalykh and Veselov [Comm. Math. Phys. 126 (1990), 597-611]. Their Hilbert series over fields of characteristic 0 were computed by Feigin and Veselov [Int. Math. Res. Not. 2002 (2002), 521-545]. In this paper, we show some partial results and make two conjectures on the Hilbert series of these spaces over fields of positive characteristic. On the other hand, Braverman, Etingof and Finkelberg [arXiv:1611.10216] introduced the spaces of quasi-invariant polynomials twisted by a monomial. We extend some of their results to the spaces twisted by a smooth function.
