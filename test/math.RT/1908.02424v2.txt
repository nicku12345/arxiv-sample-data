In this paper, we study two-term tilting complexes for preprojective algebras of non-Dynkin type. We show that there exist two families of two-term tilting complexes, which are respectively parameterized by the elements of the corresponding Coxeter group. Moreover, we provide the complete classification in the case of affine type by showing that any two-term silting complex belongs one of them. For this purpose, we also discuss the Krull-Schmidt property for the homotopy category of finitely generated projective modules over a complete ring.
