Let \mathbf{k} be an algebraically closed field, let \Lambda be a finite dimensional \mathbf{k}-algebra, and let \widehat{\Lambda} be the repetitive algebra of \Lambda. For the stable category of finitely generated left \widehat{\Lambda}-modules \widehat{\Lambda}-\underline{mod}, we show that the irreducible morphisms fall into three canonical forms: (i) all the component morphisms are split monomorphisms; (ii) all of them are split epimorphisms; (iii) there is exactly one irreducible component. We next use this fact in order to describe the shape of the Auslander-Reiten triangles in \widehat{\Lambda}-\underline{mod}. We use the fact (and prove) that every Auslander-Reiten triangle in \widehat{\Lambda}-\underline{mod} is induced from an Auslander-Reiten sequence of finitely generated left \widehat{\Lambda}-modules.
