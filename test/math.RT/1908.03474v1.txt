In this paper, we give the decomposition into irreducible characters of the restriction to the wreath product \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} \wr \mathfrak{S}_w of any irreducible character of (\mathbb{Z}_p \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{p-1}) \wr \mathfrak{S}_w, where p is any odd prime, w \geq 0 is an integer, and \mathbb{Z}_p and \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} denote the cyclic groups of order p and p-1 respectively. This answers the question of how to decompose the restrictions to p-regular elements of irreducible characters of the symmetric group \mathfrak{S}_n in the \mathbb{Z}-basis corresponding to the p-basic set of \mathfrak{S}_n described by Brunat and Gramain in [1]. The result is given in terms of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for the symmetric group.
