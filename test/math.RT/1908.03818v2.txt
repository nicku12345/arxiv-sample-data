We have determined composition series of a class of induced representations appearing in Moeglin Tadi\'c classification of discrete series. The result is further used to determine composition series of certain representations induced from Langlands quotients. This should provide more information on decomposing standard representations as well as Jacquet modules of discrete series, which has application in automorphic forms.
