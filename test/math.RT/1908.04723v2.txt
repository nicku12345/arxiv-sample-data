The author confirms a conjecture on associated varieties by Toshiyuki KOBAYASHI for the Klein four symmetric pair (\mathrm{E}_{6(-14)},\mathrm{Spin}(8,1)), which provides an alternative way to confirm the conjecture for the symmetric pair (\mathrm{Spin}(8,2),\mathrm{Spin}(8,1)). Also, for Klein four symmetric pairs (G,G^\Gamma) with the exceptional simple Lie groups G of Hermitian type, there exists a discrete series representation of G which is G^\Gamma-admissible if and only if (G,G^\Gamma) is of holomorphic type.
