With this paper we start the study of reducible representations of the Jacobi algebra with the ultimate goal of constructing differential operators invariant w.r.t. the Jacobi algebra. In this first paper we show examples of the low level singular vectors of Verma modules over the Jacobi algebra. According to our methodology these will produce the invariant differential operators.
