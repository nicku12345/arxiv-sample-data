In this paper, we introduce a class of infinite Lie conformal algebras \mathfrak{B}(\alpha,\beta,p), which are the semi-direct sums of Block type Lie conformal algebra \mathfrak{B}(p) and its non-trivial conformal modules of \Z-graded free intermediate series. The annihilation algebras are a class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, which include a lot of interesting subalgebras: Virasoro algebra, Block type Lie algebra, twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra and so on.   We give a complete classification of all finite non-trivial irreducible conformal modules of \mathfrak{B}(\alpha,\beta,p) for \alpha,\beta\in\C, p\in\C^*. As an application, the classifications of finite irreducible conformal modules over a series of finite Lie conformal algebras \mathfrak{b}(n) for n\geq1 are given.
