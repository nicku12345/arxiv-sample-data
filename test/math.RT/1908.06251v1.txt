In this paper, we study the BGG category \mathcal{O}^{\text min} for graded Lie superalgebras of Cartan type, associated with certain "minimal parabolic" subalgebra. What follows are the main results.   (1) We classify and precisely describe the blocks of \mathcal{O}^{\text min}.   (2) We investigate indecomposable tilting modules and projective modules in \mathcal{O}^{\text min}, and compute their character formulas.
