We construct blocks of finite groups with arbitrarily large \mathcal{O}-Morita Frobenius numbers. There are no known examples of two blocks defined over \mathcal{O} that are not Morita equivalent but the corresponding blocks defined over k are. Therefore, the above strongly suggests that Morita Frobenius numbers are also unbounded, which would answer a question of Benson and Kessar.
