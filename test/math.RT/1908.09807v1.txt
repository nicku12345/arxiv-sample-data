In this paper, we completely describe the Howe correspondence for the dual pairs from the title over a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero. More specifically, for every irreducible admissible representation of these groups, we find its first occurrence index in the theta correspondence and we describe, in terms of their Langlands parameters, the small theta lifts on all levels.
