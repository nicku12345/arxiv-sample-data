Let F be a non-archimedean local field of odd residual characteristic. Let G be a (connected) reductive group over F that splits over a tamely ramified field extension of F. We revisit Yu's construction of smooth complex representations of G(F) from a slightly different perspective and provide a proof that the resulting representations are supercuspidal. We also provide a counterexample to Proposition 14.1 and Theorem 14.2 in [Yu01], whose proofs relied on a typo in a reference.
