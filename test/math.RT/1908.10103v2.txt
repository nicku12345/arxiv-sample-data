We consider (iced) quiver with potential (\bar{Q}(D), F(D), \bar{W}(D)) associated to a Postnilov Diagram D and prove the mutation of the quiver with potential (\bare{Q}(D), F(D), \bar{W}(D)) is compatible with the geometric exchange of the Postnikov diagram D. This ensures we may define a quiver with potential for a Grassmannian cluster algebra. We show such quiver with potential is always rigid (thus non-degenerate) and Jacobian-finite. And in fact, it is the unique non-degenerate (thus unique rigid) quiver with potential associated to the Grassmannian cluster algebra up to right-equivalence, by using a general result of Gei\ss-Labardini-Schr\"oer. As an application, we verify that the auto-equivalence group of the generalized cluster category {\mathcal{C}}_{(Q, W)} is isomorphic to the cluster automorphism group of the associated Grassmannian cluster algebra {{\mathcal{A}}_{(Q, W)}} with trivial coefficients.
