We generalise the construction of Rouquier complexes to the setting of singular Soergel bimodules by taking minimal complexes of the restriction of Rouquier complexes. We show that they retain many of the properties of ordinary Rouquier complexes: they are delta-split, they satisfy a vanishing formula and, when Soergel's conjecture holds they are perverse. As an application, we use singular Rouquier complexes to establish Hodge theory for singular Soergel bimodules.
