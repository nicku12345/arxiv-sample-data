For Nakayama algebras A, we prove that in case Ext_A^1(M,M) \neq 0 for an indecomposable A-module M, we have that the projective dimension of M is infinite. As an application we give a new proof of a classical result from \cite{Gus} on bounds of the Loewy length for Nakayama algebras with finite global dimension. For Brauer tree algebras A with an indecomposable module M, we prove that Ext_A^1(M,M) \neq 0 implies Ext_A^i(M,M) \neq 0 for all i>0.
