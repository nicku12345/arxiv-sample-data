We describe the structure of the tensor product of the basic Fock representation of sl(\infty) with its shifted dual. More precisely we prove that this tensor product has a unique decreasing filtration with simple quotients. We use the categorification of this representation via translation functors in the abelain envelope of the Deligne category GL(t) for integral t. We also compute dimensions of standard and tilting objects in this abelian envelope.
