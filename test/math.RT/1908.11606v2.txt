Shigechi and Zinn-Justin (arXiv:1001.1080) described the parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for Grassmannians by counting certain Dyck partitions. We "lift" their combinatorial formula to the intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties in Grassmannians and we obtain many bases of the intersection cohomology which extend (after dualizing) the classical Schubert basis of the ordinary cohomology.
