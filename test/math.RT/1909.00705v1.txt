For \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C}), let w be an element in the Weyl group W=S_n. We use L_w to denote a highest weight module of \mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C}) with highest weight -w\rho-\rho. In this paper we will give a characterization for those w such that L_w is a highest weight Harish-Chandra module and the associated variety of L_w will be characterized by the information of w. We also count the number of those highest weight Harish-Chandra modules L_w in a given Harish-Chandra cell. Finally, we give some other highest weight modules with irreducible associated varieties from the smoothness of Schubert varieties.
