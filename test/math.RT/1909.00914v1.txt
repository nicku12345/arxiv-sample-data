Let \mathfrak{g} be a simple Lie algebra with a Weyl group W. Let L_w be a simple module with highest weight -w\rho-\rho. By using a conjecture of Tanisaki, we show that there is a bijection between the right cells and associated varieties of highest weight modules with infinitesimal character \rho. When L(\lambda) is a simple integral highest weight module of \mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C}) with the minimal Gelfand-Kirillov dimension n-1, we will show that its associated variety is irreducible. In particular, its associated variety will be given in the information of \lambda. When L(\lambda) is a simple highest weight module of \mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C}) in a given parabolic category \mathscr{O}^{\mathfrak{p}} with maximal Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, we will show that its associated variety is also irreducible.
