In this paper, following a similar procedure developed by Buttcane and Miller in \cite{MillerButtcane} for SL(3,\RR), the (\frakg,K)-module structure of the minimal principal series of real reductive Lie groups SU(2,1) is described explicitly by realizing the representations in the space of K-finite functions on U(2). Moreover, by combining combinatorial techniques and contour integrations, this paper introduces a method of calculating intertwining operators on the principal series. Upon restriction to each K-type, the matrix entries of intertwining operators are represented by \Gamma-functions and Laurent series coefficients of hypergeometric series. The calculation of the (\frakg,K)-module structure of principal series can be generalized to real reductive Lie groups whose maximal compact subgroup is a product of SU(2)'s and U(1)'s.
