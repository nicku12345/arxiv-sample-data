We establish explicit isomorphisms of two seemingly-different algebras, and their Schur algebras, arising from the centralizers of two different type B Weyl group actions in Schur-like dualities. We provide a presentation of the geometric counterpart of the above Schur algebras in Bao-Kujawa-Li-Wang (2018) specialized at q=1.
