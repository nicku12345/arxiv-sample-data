Let W be the Weyl group of type BC_n. We first provide restriction formulas of the total Springer representations for the symplectic Lie algebra in characteristic 2 and the exotic case to the maximal parabolic subgroup of W which is of type BC_{n-1}. Then we show that these two restriction formulas are equivalent, and discuss how the results can be used to examine the existence of affine pavings of Springer fibers corresponding to the symplectic Lie algebra in characteristic 2.
