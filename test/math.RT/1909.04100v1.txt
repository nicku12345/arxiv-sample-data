Deligne's category \underline{{\rm Rep}}(S_t) is a tensor category depending on a parameter t "interpolating" the categories of representations of the symmetric groups S_n. We construct a family of categories \mathcal{C}_\lambda (depending on a vector of variables \lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_l), that may be specialised to values in the ground ring) which are module categories over \underline{{\rm Rep}}(S_t). The categories \mathcal{C}_\lambda are defined over any ring and are constructed by interpolating permutation representations. Further, they admit specialisation functors to S_n-mod which are tensor-compatible with the functors \underline{{\rm Rep}}(S_t) \to S_n-mod. We show that \mathcal{C}_\lambda can be presented using the Kostant integral form of Lusztig's universal enveloping algebra \dot{U}(\mathfrak{gl_{\infty}}), and exhibit a categorification of some stability properties of Kronecker coefficients.
