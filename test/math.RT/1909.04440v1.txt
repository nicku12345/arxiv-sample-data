Let A be a finite-dimensional self-injective algebra over an algebraically closed field, \mathcal{C} a stably quasi-serial component (i.e. its stable part is a tube) of rank n of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of A, and \mathcal{S} be a simple-minded system of the stable module category \stmod{A}. We show that the intersection \mathcal{S}\cap\mathcal{C} is of size strictly less than n, and consists only of modules with quasi-length strictly less than n. In particular, all modules in the homogeneous tubes of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of A cannot be in any simple-minded system.
