For an essentially tame supercuspidal representation \pi of a connected reductive p-adic group G, we establish two distinct and complementary sufficient conditions for the irreducible components of its restriction to a maximal compact subgroup to occur in a representation of G which is not inertially equivalent to \pi. These two results are further formulated in terms of the geometry of the Bruhat-Tits building of G and its fixed points under the action of certain tori. The consequence is a set of broadly applicable tools for addressing the branching rules of \pi and the unicity of [G,\pi]_G-types.
