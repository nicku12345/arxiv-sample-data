James's Conjecture predicts that the adjustment matrix for blocks of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group is the identity matrix when the weight of the block is strictly less than the characteristic of the field. In this paper, we consider the case when the characteristic of the field is greater than or equal to 5, and prove that the adjustment matrix for the principal block of \mathcal{H}_{5e} is the identity matrix whenever e\neq4. When e=4, we are able to calculate all but two entries of the adjustment matrix.
