Let F be a p-adic field and \mathbf{U} be a unipotent group defined over F, and set U=\mathbf{U}(F). Let \sigma be an involution of \mathbf{U} defined over F. Adapting the arguments of Yves Benoist in the real case, we prove the following result: an irreducible representation \pi of U is U^{\sigma}-distinguished if and only if it is \sigma-self-dual and in this case \mathrm{Hom}_{U^\sigma}(\pi,\mathbb{C}) has dimension one. When \sigma is a Galois involution these results imply a bijective correspondence between the set \mathrm{Irr}(U^\sigma) of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of U^\sigma and the set \mathrm{Irr}_{U^\sigma-\mathrm{dist}}(U) of isomorphism classes of distinguished irreducible representations of U.
