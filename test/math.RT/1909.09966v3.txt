For a connected reductive group G defined over a non-archimedean local field F, we consider the Bernstein blocks in the category of smooth representations of G(F). Bernstein blocks whose cuspidal support involves a regular supercuspidal representation are called \textit{regular} Bernstein blocks. Most Bernstein blocks are regular when the residual characteristic of F is not too small. Under mild hypotheses on the residual characteristic, we show that the Bernstein center of a regular Bernstein block of G(F) is isomorphic to the Bernstein center of a regular depth-zero Bernstein block of G^{0}(F), where G^{0} is a certain twisted Levi subgroup of G. In some cases, we show that the blocks themselves are equivalent, and as a consequence we prove the ABPS Conjecture in some new cases.
