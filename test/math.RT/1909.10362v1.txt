This article has the following aims:   (1) Extend the notion of fuchsian singularities (of first kind) to base fields of arbitrary characteristic.   (2) Discuss their relationship to mathematical objects of a different nature.   (3) Provide a purely ring-theoretic characterization of fuchsian singularities.   (4) Expoloit their singularity categories and their Grothendieck groups.
