We generalize type A quivers to continuous type A quivers and prove basic results about pointwise finite-dimensional representations. In particular, we generalize Crawley-Boevey's BarCode theorem to continuous quivers with alternating orientations: every pointwise finite-dimensional representation of a continuous type A quiver is the direct sum of pointwise one-dimensional indecomposable whose supports are intervals. This recovers a result of [5]. We also classify the indecomposable projective representations. This is part of a longer work in which we study a generalization of the continuous cluster category (introduced by the first and last author in 2015) and a continuous generalization of mutation.
