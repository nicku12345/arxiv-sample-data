We introduce super Yangians of \mathfrak{gl}(V),\mathfrak{sl}(V) (in the new Drinfeld realization) associated to all Dynkin diagrams of \mathfrak{gl}(V), where V is a finite-dimensional super vector space. We show that all of them are isomorphic to the super Yangians introduced by Maxim Nazarov, by identifying them with the corresponding RTT super Yangians. However, their "positive halves" are not pairwise isomorphic, and we obtain the shuffle algebra realizations of those. We adapt the latter to the trigonometric setup by obtaining the shuffle algebra realizations of the "positive halves" of type A quantum loop superalgebras associated to arbitrary Dynkin diagrams.
