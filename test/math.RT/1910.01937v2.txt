First, we show that \tau-tilting finite strongly simply connected algebras are representation-finite, and some related algebras are considered, including weakly shod algebras, iterated tilted algebras, tubular algebras and so on. Second, we use an example to discuss the connection between the number of \tau-tilting A-modules and the number of \tau-tilting k\mathbb{D}_n-modules, where A is a tilted algebra of Dynkin type \mathbb{D}_n and k\mathbb{D}_n is a path algebra over an algebraically closed field k.
