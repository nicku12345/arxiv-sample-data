In this paper, we study the representations of the periplectic Lie superalgebra using the Duflo-Serganova functor. Given a simple \mathfrak{p}(n)-module L and a certain element x\in \mathfrak{p}(n) of rank 1, we give an explicit description of the composition factors of the \mathfrak{p}(n-1)-module DS_x(L), which is defined as the homology of the complex \Pi M \xrightarrow{x} M \xrightarrow{x} \Pi M. In particular, we show that this \mathfrak{p}(n-1)-module is multiplicity-free. We then use this result to give a simple explicit combinatorial formula for the superdimension of a simple integrable finite-dimensional \mathfrak{p}(n)-module, based on its highest weight. In particular, this reproves the Kac-Wakimoto conjecture for \mathfrak{p}(n), which was proved earlier by the authors.
