Let G be SL(n, \mathbb{C}). This paper aims to describe the Zhelobenko parameters and the spin-lowest K-types of the scattered representations of G, which lie at the heart of \hat{G}^d - the set of all the equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G with non-vanishing Dirac cohomology. As a consequence, we will verify a couple of conjectures of the first-named author for G.
