For an irreducible dual pair (G, G') \in Sp(W) with one member compact and two representations \Pi \leftrightarrow \Pi' appearing in the Howe duality, we give an expression of the character \Theta_{\Pi'} of \Pi' via the character of \Pi. We make computations for the dual pair (G = U(n, \mathbb{C}), G' = U(p, q, \mathbb{C})), which are explicit in low dimensions. For (G = U(1, \mathbb{C}), G' = U(1, 1, \mathbb{C})), we verify directly a result of H. Hecht saying that the character has the same value on both Cartan subgroups of G'.
