Let \mathcal{X} be a resolving and contravariantly finite subcategory of \rm{mod}\mbox{-}\Lambda, the category of finitely generated right \Lambda-modules. We associate to \mathcal{X} the subcategory \mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{X}}(\Lambda) of the morphism category \rm{H}(\Lambda) consisting of all monomorphisms (A\stackrel{f}\rightarrow B) with A, B and \rm{Cok} \ f in \mathcal{\mathcal{X}}. Since \mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{X}}(\Lambda) is closed under extensions then it inherits naturally an exact structure from \rm{H}(\Lambda). We will define two other different exact structures else than the canonical one on \mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{X}}(\Lambda), and the indecomposable projective (resp. injective) objects in the corresponding exact categories completely classified. Enhancing \mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{X}}(\Lambda) with the new exact structure provides a framework to construct a triangle functor. Let \rm{mod}\mbox{-}\underline{\mathcal{X}} denote the category of finitely presented functors over the stable category \underline{\mathcal{X}}. We then use the triangle functor to show a triangle equivalence between the bounded derived category \mathbb{D}^{\rm{b}}(\rm{mod}\mbox{-}\underline{\mathcal{X}}) and a Verdier quotient of the bounded derived category of the associated exact category on \mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{X}}(\Lambda). Similar consideration is also given for the singularity category of \rm{mod}\mbox{-}\underline{\mathcal{X}}.
