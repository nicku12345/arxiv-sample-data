This work is the sequel to Continuous Quivers of Type A (I). In this paper we define the Auslander-Reiten space of a continuous type A quiver, which generalizes the Auslander-Reiten quiver of type A_n quivers. We prove that extensions, kernels, and cokernels of representations of type A_{\mathbb R} can be described by lines and rectangles in a way analogous to representations of type A_n. We provide a similar description for distinguished triangles in the bounded derived category whose first and third terms are indecomposable. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of Auslander-Reiten sequences in the category of finitely generated representations of A_{\mathbb R}. This is part of a longer work; the other papers in this series are with Kiyoshi Igusa and Gordana Todorov. The goal of this series is to generalize cluster categories, clusters, and mutation for type A_n quivers to continuous versions for type A_{\mathbb R} quivers.   (Added Section 5 to version 2.)
