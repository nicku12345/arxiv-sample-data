Let \mathbb{G} be a split connected reductive group scheme over the ring of integers \mathfrak{o} of a finite extension L|\mathbb{Q}_p and \lambda\in X(\mathbb{T}) an algebraic character of a split maximal torus \mathbb{T}\subseteq\mathbb{G}. Let us also consider X^{\text{rig}} the rigid analytic flag variety of \mathbb{G} and G=\mathbb{G}(L). In the first part of this paper, we introduce a family of \lambda-twisted differential operators on a formal model \mathfrak{Y} of X^{\text{rig}}. We compute their global sections and we prove coherence together with several cohomological properties. In the second part, we define the category of coadmissible G-equivariant arithmetic \mathcal{D}(\lambda)-modules over the family of formal models of the rigid flag variety X^{\text{rig}}. We show that if \lambda is such that \lambda + \rho is dominant and regular (\rho being the Weyl character), then the preceding category is anti-equivalent to the category of admissible locally analytic G-representations, with central character \lambda. In particular, we generalize the results of Huyghe-Patel-Strauch-Schmidt for algebraic characters (cf. [25] in the text).
