Let F be a p-adic field and let G be a connected reductive group defined over F. We assume p is big. Denote \mathfrak{g} the Lie algebra of G. To each vertex s of the reduced Bruhat-Tits' building of G, we associate as usual a reductive Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_{s} defined over the residual field {\mathbb F}_{q}. We normalize suitably a Fourier-transform f\mapsto \hat{f} on C_{c}^{\infty}(\mathfrak{g}(F)). We study the subspace of functions f\in C_{c}^{\infty}(\mathfrak{g}(F)) such that the orbital integrals of f and of \hat{f} are 0 for each element of  \mathfrak{g}(F) which is not topologically nilpotent. This space is related to the characteristic functions of the character-sheaves on the spaces \mathfrak{g}_{s}({\mathbb F}_{q}), for each vertex s, which are cuspidal and with nilpotent support. We prove that our subspace behave well under endoscopy.
