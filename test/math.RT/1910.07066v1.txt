We consider analogues of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand resolution in a highest weight category \mathscr{P}. We prove the resulting category of complexes is a chain-level lift of the heart of the constructible t-structure on its bounded derived category D^b(\mathscr{P}). In particular, an object admits a Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand resolution if and only if a certain \operatorname{Ext} vanishing with costandard objects holds. These results appear to be new even for Category \mathscr{O}.
