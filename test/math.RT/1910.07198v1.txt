Let G be a reductive p-adic group which splits over an unramified extension of the ground field. Hiraga, Ichino and Ikeda conjectured that the formal degree of a square-integrable G-representation \pi can be expressed in terms of the adjoint \gamma-factor of the enhanced L-parameter of \pi. A similar conjecture was posed for the Plancherel densities of tempered irreducible G-representations.   We prove these conjectures for unipotent G-representations. We also derive explicit formulas for the involved adjoint \gamma-factors.
