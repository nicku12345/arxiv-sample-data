In Roger Howe's 1989 paper, "Remarks on classical invariant theory," Howe introduces the notion of a "dual pair of Lie subalgebras" - a pair (\mathfrak{g}_1, \mathfrak{g}_2) of reductive Lie subalgebras of a Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} such that \mathfrak{g}_1 and \mathfrak{g}_2 are each other's centralizers in \mathfrak{g}. This notion has a natural analog for algebraic groups; namely, a "dual pair of subgroups" is a pair (G_1, G_2) of reductive subgroups of an algebraic group G such that G_1 and G_2 are each other's centralizers in G. We present substantial progress towards classifying the dual pairs of the complex classical groups (GL(n,\mathbb{C}), SL(n,\mathbb{C}), Sp(2n,\mathbb{C}), O(n,\mathbb{C}), and SO(n,\mathbb{C})) and their projective counterparts (PGL(n,\mathbb{C}), PSp(2n,\mathbb{C}), PO(n,\mathbb{C}), PSO(n,\mathbb{C})). The classifications of dual pairs in Sp(2n,\mathbb{C}), GL(n,\mathbb{C}), and O(n,\mathbb{C}) are known, but lack a unified explicit treatment; we provide such a treatment. Additionally, we classify the dual pairs in SL(n,\mathbb{C}) and SO(n,\mathbb{C}), and present partial progress towards classifying the dual pairs in PGL(n,\mathbb{C}), PSp(2n,\mathbb{C}), and PO(n,\mathbb{C}).
