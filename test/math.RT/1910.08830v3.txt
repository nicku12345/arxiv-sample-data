We show that the decomposition matrix of unipotent \ell-blocks of a finite reductive group \mathbf{G}(\mathbb{F}_q) has a unitriangular shape, assuming q is a power of a good prime and \ell is very good for \mathbf{G}. This was conjectured by Geck in 1990 as part of his PhD thesis. We establish this result by constructing projective modules using a modification of generalised Gelfand--Graev characters introduced by Kawanaka. We prove that each such character has at most one unipotent constituent which occurs with multiplicity one. This establishes a 30 year old conjecture of Kawanaka.
