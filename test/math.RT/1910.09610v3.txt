We give a definition of the notion of spherical varieties in the world of complex supervarieties with actions of algebraic supergroups. A characterization of affine spherical supervarieties is given which generalizes a characterization in the classical case. We also explain some general properties of the monoid of highest weights. Several examples are given that are interesting in their own right and highlight differences with the classical case, including the regular representation, symmetric supervarieties, and actions of split supergroups.
