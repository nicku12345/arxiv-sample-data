We study the effect of the Howe correspondence on Harish-Chandra series for type I dual pairs (\mathbf{U}_m(\mathbb{F}_q),\mathbf{U}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)) and (\mathbf{Sp}_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_q),\mathbf{O}^\pm_{2n}(\mathbb{F}_q)), where \mathbb{F}_q denotes the finite field with q elements (q odd). We use the Lusztig correspondence to reduce the study of the Howe correspondence between Harish-Chandra series to a correspondence between unipotent Harish-Chandra series. Finally, we provide two applications of these results.
