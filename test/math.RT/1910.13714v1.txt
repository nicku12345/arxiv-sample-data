For a quiver with non-degenerate potential, we study the associated stability scattering diagram and how it changes under mutations. We show that under mutations the stability scattering diagram behaves like the cluster scattering diagram associated to the same quiver, which gives them identical cluster chamber structures. As an application, we prove if the quiver has a green-to-red sequence, these two scattering diagrams are identical and if the quiver comes from a once-punctured torus, they differ by a central wall-crossing. This verifies in those cases a conjecture of Kontsevich-Soibelman that a particular set of initial data given by a quiver determines the Donaldson-Thomas series of the quiver with a non-degenerate potential.
