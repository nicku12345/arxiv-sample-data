Let G be a noncompact connected simple Lie group, and (G,G^\Gamma) a Klein four symmetric pair. In this paper, the author shows a necessary condition for the discrete decomposability of unitarizable simple (\mathfrak{g},K)-modules for Klein for symmetric pairs. Precisely, if certain conditions hold for (G,G^\Gamma), there does not exist any unitarizable simple (\mathfrak{g},K)-module that is discretely decomposable as a (\mathfrak{g}^\Gamma,K^\Gamma)-module. As an application, for G=\mathrm{E}_{6(-14)}, the author obtains a complete classification of Klein four symmetric pairs (G,G^\Gamma) with G^\Gamma noncompact, such that there exists at least one nontrivial unitarizable simple (\mathfrak{g},K)-module that is discretely decomposable as a (\mathfrak{g}^\Gamma,K^\Gamma)-module and is also discretely decomposable as a (\mathfrak{g}^\sigma,K^\sigma)-module for some nonidentity element \sigma\in\Gamma.
