We consider smooth representations of the unit group G = \mathcal{A}^{\times} of a finite-dimensional split basic algebra \mathcal{A} over a non-Archimedean local field. In particular, we prove a version of Gutkin's conjecture, namely, we prove that every irreducible smooth representation of G is compactly induced by a one-dimensional representation of the unit group of some subalgebra of \mathcal{A}. We also discuss admissibility and unitarisability of smooth representations of G.
