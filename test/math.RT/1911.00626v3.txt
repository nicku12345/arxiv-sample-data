If a Nakayama algebra is not cyclic, it has finite global dimension. For a cyclic Nakayama algebra, there are many characterizations of when it has finite global dimension. In [She17], Shen gave such a characterization using Ringel's resolution quiver. In [IZ92], the second author, with Zacharia, gave a cyclic homology characterization for when a monomial relation algebra has finite global dimension. We show directly that these criteria are equivalent for all Nakayama algebras. Our comparison result also reproves both characterizations. In a separate paper we discuss an interesting example that came up in our attempt to generalize this comparison result to arbitrary monomial relation algebras [HI19].
