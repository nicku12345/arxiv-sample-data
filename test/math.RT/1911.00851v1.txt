Various constructions for quantum groups have been generalized to \imath-quantum groups. Such generalization is called \imath-program. In this paper, we fill one of parts in the \imath-program. Namely, we provide an equivariant K-theory approach to \imath-quantum groups associated to the Satake diagram in \eqref{eq1}, which is the Langlands dual picture of that constructed in \cite{BKLW14}, where a geometric realization of the \imath-quantum group is provided by using perverse sheaves. As an application of the main results, we prove Li's conjecture \cite{L18} for the special cases with the satake diagram in \eqref{eq1}.
