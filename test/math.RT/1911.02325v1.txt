In this article we characterize the subcategory \Omega^{\infty}(\mod A) for algebras of \Omega^{n}-finite representation type. As a consequence, we charaterize when a truncated path algebra is a Co-Gorenstein algebra in terms of its associated quiver. We also study the behaviour of Artin algebras of \Omega^{\infty}-infinite representation type. Finally, it is presented an example of a non Gorenstein algebra of \Omega^{\infty}-infinite representation type and an example of a finite dimensional algebra with infinite \phi-dimension.
