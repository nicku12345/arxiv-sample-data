Let n be a positive integer and \lambda be a partition of n. Let M^\lambda be the Young permutation module labelled by \lambda. In this paper, we study symmetric and exterior powers of M^\lambda in positive characteristic case. We determine the symmetric and exterior powers of M^\lambda that are projective. All the indecomposable exterior powers of M^\lambda are also classified. We then prove some results for indecomposable direct summands that have the largest complexity in direct sum decompositions of some symmetric and exterior powers of M^\lambda. We end by parameterizing all the Scott modules that are isomorphic to direct summands of the symmetric or exterior square of M^\lambda and determining their corresponding multiplicities explicitly.
