A visible action on a complex manifold is a holomorphic action that admits a J-transversal totally real submanifold S. It is said to be strongly visible if there exists an orbit-preserving anti-holomorphic diffeomorphism \sigma  such that \sigma |_S = \operatorname{id}_S. Let G be the Heisenberg group and H a non-trivial connected closed subgroup of G. We prove that any complex homogeneous space D = G^{\mathbb{C}}/H^{\mathbb{C}} admits a strongly visible L-action, where L stands for a connected closed subgroup of G explicitly constructed through a co-exponential basis of H in G. This leads in turn that G itself acts strongly visibly on D. The proof is carried out by finding explicitly an orbit-preserving anti-holomorphic diffeomorphism and a totally real submanifold S, for which the dimension depends upon the dimensions of G and H. As a direct application, our geometric results provide a proof of various multiplicity-free theorems on continuous representations on the space of holomorphic sections on D. Moreover, we also generate as a consequence, a geometric criterion for a quasi-regular representation of G to be multiplicity-free.
