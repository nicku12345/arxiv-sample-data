In this paper, we define the affine super Yangian Y_{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m|n)) with a coproduct structure. We also obtain an evaluation homomorphism, that is, an algebra homomorphism from Y_{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m|n)) to the completion of the universal enveloping algebra of \widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(m|n).
