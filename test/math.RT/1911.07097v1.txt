This note extends the Steinberg Tensor product theorem from the Frobenius kernel G_{(r)} to the deformation \mathcal{U}^{[r]}(\mathfrak{g}) of its distribution algebra. As a Corollary we proof some conjectures from \cite{Wes}. Further it describes the graded representation theory of \mathcal{U}^{[r]}(\mathfrak{g}) at a generic semisimple p-central character as a twist of the category of graded G_{(r-1)}-modules. We conclude by explaining this relation for SL_2 explicitely as well as computing the center in this case.
