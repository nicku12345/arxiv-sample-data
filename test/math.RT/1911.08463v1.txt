We study representation theory of quantizations of Nakajima quiver varieties associated to bouquet quivers. We show that there are no finite dimensional representations of the quantizations \overline{\mathcal{A}}_{\lambda}(n, \ell) if dim V=n is greater than 1 and so is the number of loops \ell. We find that there is a Hamiltonian torus action with finitely many fixed points in case n\leq 3, provide the dimensions of Hom-spaces between standard objects in category \mathcal{O} and compute the multiplicities of simples in standards for n=2 in case of one-dimensional framing and generic one-parameter subgroups. We establish the abelian localisation theorem and find the values of parameters, for which the quantizations have infinite homological dimension.
