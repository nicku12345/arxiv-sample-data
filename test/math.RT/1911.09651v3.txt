In the present paper, a class of non-weight modules over the super-BMS_3 algebras \S^{\epsilon} (\epsilon=0 or \frac{1}{2}) are constructed. These modules when regarded as \S^{0}-modules and further restricted as modules over the Cartan subalgebra \mathfrak{h} are free of rank 1, while when regarded as \S^{\frac{1}{2}}-modules and further restricted as modules over the Cartan subalgebra \mathfrak{H} are free of rank 2. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for these modules being simple, as well as determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for two \S^{\epsilon}-modules being isomorphic. At last, we present that these modules constitute a complete classification of free U(\mathfrak{h})-modules of rank 1 over \S^{0}, and also constitute a complete classification of free U(\mathfrak{H})-modules of rank 2 over \S^{\frac{1}{2}}.
