We prove Brauer's k(B)-Conjecture for the 3-blocks with abelian defect groups of rank at most 5 and for all 3-blocks of defect at most 4. For this purpose we develop a computer algorithm to construct isotypies based on a method of Usami and Puig. This leads further to some previously unknown perfect isometries for the 5-blocks of defect 2. We also investigate basic sets which are compatible under the action of the inertial group.
