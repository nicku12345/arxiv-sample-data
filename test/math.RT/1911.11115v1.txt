In this paper we study some combinatorial properties of the shuffle algebra S_{q_{1},q_{2}} with two complex parameters and, in particular, obtain the Hilbert series for S_{q_{1},q_{2}}/I, where I is the ideal generated by z-\lambda for both generic q_{1},q_{2} and satisfying the relation q_{1}^{a}q_{2}^{b}=1 with a, b \in \mathbb{N}.
