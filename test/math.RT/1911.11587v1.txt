A sheaf-theoretic version of the Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov functor KZ from degenerate double affine Hecke algebras to affine Hecke algebras is introduced. The relation of KZ with the original Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov monodromy functor is discussed. We prove that \KZ satisfies the double centraliser property under certain conditions. In the case of GL_n, the relation with the quiver Schur algebra is discussed and a symplectic version of the quiver Schur algebra is proposed.
