Let F be a non archimedean local field of residual characteristic p and \ell a prime number different from p. Let \mathrm{V} denote Vign\'eras' \ell-modular local Langlands correspondence between irreducible \ell-modular representations of \mathrm{GL}_n(F) and n-dimensional \ell-modular Deligne representations of the Weil group \mathrm{W}_F. In a previous work, enlarging the space of parameters to Deligne representations with non necessarily nilpotent operators, we proposed a modification of the correspondence of Vign\'eras into a correspondence \mathrm{C} compatible with the formation of local constants in the generic case. In this note, following a remark of Alberto M\'inguez, we characterize the modification \mathrm{C}\circ \mathrm{V}^{-1} by a short list of natural properties.
