Let \mathfrak g be a simple Lie algebra, \mathfrak h a Levi subalgebra, and C_{\mathfrak h}\in U(\mathfrak h) the Casimir element defined via the restriction of the Killing form on \mathfrak g to \mathfrak h. We study C_{\mathfrak h}-eigenvalues in \mathfrak g/\mathfrak h and related \mathfrak h-modules. Without loss of generality, one may assume that \mathfrak h is a maximal Levi. Then \mathfrak g is equipped with the natural \mathbb Z-grading \mathfrak g=\bigoplus_{i\in\mathbb Z}\mathfrak g(i) such that \mathfrak g(0)=\mathfrak h and \mathfrak g(i) is a simple \mathfrak h-module for i\ne 0. We give explicit formulae for the C_\mathfrak h-eigenvalues in each \mathfrak g(i), i\ne 0, and relate eigenvalues of C_\mathfrak h in \bigwedge^\bullet\mathfrak g(1) to the dimensions of abelian subspaces of \mathfrak g(1). We also prove that if \mathfrak a\subset\mathfrak g(1) is abelian, whereas \mathfrak g(1) is not, then \dim\mathfrak a\le \dim\mathfrak g(1)/2. Moreover, if \dim\mathfrak a=(\dim\mathfrak g(1))/2, then \mathfrak a has an abelian complement. The \mathbb Z-gradings of height \le 2 are closely related to involutions of \mathfrak g, and we provide a connection of our theory to (an extension of) the "strange formula" of Freudenthal-de Vries.
