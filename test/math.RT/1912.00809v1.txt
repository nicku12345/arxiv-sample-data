Let X be a real prehomogeneous vector space under a reductive group G, such that X is an absolutely spherical G-variety with affine open orbit. We define local zeta integrals that involve the integration of Schwartz-Bruhat functions on X against generalized matrix coefficients of admissible representations of G(\mathbb{R}), twisted by complex powers of relative invariants. We establish the convergence of these integrals in some range, the meromorphic continuation as well as a functional equation in terms of abstract \gamma-factors. This subsumes the Archimedean zeta integrals of Godement-Jacquet, those of Sato-Shintani (in the spherical case), and the previous works of Bopp-Rubenthaler. The proof of functional equations is based on Knop's results on Capelli operators.
