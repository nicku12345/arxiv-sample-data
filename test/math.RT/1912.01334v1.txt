To study the Fourier expansions of automorphic forms on G=\mathrm{SU}(2,1) one needs to understand the representations of the Lie algebra of G in functions on G that transform on the left under the unipotent group N according to a representation of N. Since for \mathrm{SU}(2,1) the unipotent group is isomorphic to the Heisenberg group, one needs not only to use characters of N but also realizations of the infinite-dimensional Schr\"odinger representation. We allow a general type of automorphic form that need not satisfy the usual condition of polynomial growth at the cusps. We carry out a detailed description of the resulting representations of the Lie algebra of G and their occurrence in Fourier term modules.
