We study a simple, self-dual, rational, and C_2-cofinite vertex operator algebra of CFT-type whose simple current modules are graded by \mathbb{Z}_{2k}. Based on those simple current modules, a vertex operator algebra associated with a \mathbb{Z}_{2k}-code is constructed. The classification of irreducible modules for such a vertex operator algebra is established. Furthermore, all the irreducible modules are realized in a module for a certain lattice vertex operator algebra.
