For l,n \in \mathbb{N} we define tonal partition algebra P^l_n over \mathbb{Z}[\delta]. We construct modules \{ \Delta_{\underline{\mu}} \}_{\underline{\mu}} for P^l_n over \mathbb{Z}[\delta], and hence over any integral domain containing \mathbb{Z}[\delta] that is a \mathbb{Z}[\delta]-algebra (such as \mathbb{C}[\delta]), that pass to a complete set of irreducible modules over the field of fractions. We show that P^l_n is semisimple there. That is, we construct for the tonal partition algebras a modular system in the sense of Brauer [6]. (The aim is to investigate the non-semisimple structure of the tonal partition algebras over suitable quotient fields of the natural ground ring, from a geometric perspective.) Using a `geometrical' index set for the \Delta-modules, we give an order with respect to which the decomposition matrix over \mathbb{C} (with \delta \in \mathbb{C}^{\times}) is upper-unitriangular. We establish several crucial properties of the \Delta-modules. These include a tower property, with respect to n, in the sense of Green [20, \S 6] and Cox \textit{ et al} [8]; contravariant forms with respect to a natural involutive antiautomorphism; a highest weight category property; and branching rules.
