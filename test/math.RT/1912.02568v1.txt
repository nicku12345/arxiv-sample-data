In this paper, we study the unitarizations in the spaces of holomorphic sections of equivariant holomorphic line bundles over a bounded homogeneous domain under the action of a connected algebraic group acting transitively on the domain. We give a complete classification of unitary representations arising from such unitarizations. As an application, we classify all such unitary representations for a specific five-dimensional non-symmetric bounded homogeneous domain.
