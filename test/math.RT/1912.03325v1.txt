We construct an equivalence of graded Abelian categories from a category of representations of the quiver-Hecke algebra of type A_1^{(1)} to the category of equivariant perverse coherent sheaves on the nilpotent cone of type A. We prove that this equivalence is weakly monoidal. This gives a representation-theoretic categorification of the preprojective K-theoretic Hall algebra considered by Schiffmann-Vasserot. Using this categorification, we compare the monoidal categorification of the quantum open unipotent cells of type A_1^{(1)} given by Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park in terms of quiver-Hecke algebras with the one given by Cautis-Williams in terms of equivariant perverse coherent sheaves on the affine Grassmannians.
