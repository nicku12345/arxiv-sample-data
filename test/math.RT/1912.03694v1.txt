Let G be a connected reductive group scheme acting on a spherical scheme X. In the case where G is of type A_n, Aizenbud and Avni proved the existence of a number C such that the multiplicity \dim\hom(\rho,\mathbb{C}[X(F)]) is bounded by C, for any finite field F and any irreducible representation \rho of G(F). In this paper, we generalize this result to the case where G is a connected reductive group scheme over \mathbb{Z}, and prove Conjecture A of [1].
