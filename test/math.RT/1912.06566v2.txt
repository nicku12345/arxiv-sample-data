The consistent systems of idempotents of Meyer and Solleveld allow to construct Serre subcategories of Rep_R(G), the category of smooth representations of a p-adic group G with coefficients in R. In particular, they were used to construct level 0 decompositions when R=\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{\ell}, \ell \neq p, by Dat for GL_n and the author for a more general group. Wang proved in the case of GL_n that the subcategory associated with a system of idempotents is equivalent to a category of coefficient systems on the Bruhat-Tits building. This result was used by Dat to prove an equivalence between an arbitrary level zero block of GL_n and a unipotent block of another group. In this paper, we generalize Wang's equivalence of category to a connected reductive group on a non-archimedean local field.
