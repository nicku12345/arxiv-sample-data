For a quasi-split group G over a local field F, with Borel subgroup B=TU and Weyl group W, there is a natural geometric action of G\times T on L^2(X), where X=G/U is the basic affine space of G. For split groups, Gelfand and Graev have extended this action to an action of G\times (T\rtimes W) by generalized Fourier transforms \Phi_w. We define an analog of these operators for quasi-split groups. We also extend the construction of the Schwartz space \mathcal S (X) by Braverman and Kazhdan to the case of quasi-split groups.
