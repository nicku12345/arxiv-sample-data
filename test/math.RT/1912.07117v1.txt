We investigate cohomological support varieties for finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras defined over fields of odd characteristic. Verifying a conjecture from our previous work, we show the support variety of a finite-dimensional supermodule can be realized as an explicit subset of the odd nullcone of the underlying Lie superalgebra. We also show the support variety of a finite-dimensional supermodule is zero if and only if the supermodule is of finite projective dimension. As a consequence, we obtain a positive characteristic version of a theorem of B{\o}gvad, showing that if a finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra over a field of odd characteristic is absolutely torsion free, then its enveloping algebra is of finite global dimension.
