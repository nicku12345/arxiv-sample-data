We prove that the singularities of the R-matrix R(k) of the minimal quantization of the adjoint representation of the Yangian Y(\mathfrak g) of a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra \mathfrak g are the opposite of the roots of the monic polynomial p(k) entering in the OPE expansions of quantum fields of conformal weight 3/2 of the universal minimal affine W-algebra at level k attached to \mathfrak g.
