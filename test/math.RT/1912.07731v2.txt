Let k be a field and consider the path algebra kQ of the quiver Q. A pair of indecomposable kQ-modules (Y,X) is called an orthogonal exceptional pair if the modules are exceptional and \operatorname{Hom}(X,Y)=\operatorname{Hom}(Y,X)=\operatorname{Ext}^{1}(X,Y)=0. Denote by \mathcal{F}(X,Y) the full subcategory of objects having filtration with factors X and Y. By the theorem of Schofield if Z is exceptional but not simple, then Z\in\mathcal{F}(X,Y) for some orthogonal exceptional pair (Y,X), and Z is not a simple object in \mathcal{F}(X,Y). In fact, there are precisely s(Z)-1 such pairs, where s(Z) is the support of Z (i.e the number of nonzero components in {\underline\dim}Z). Whereas it is easy to construct Z given X and Y, there is no convenient procedure yet to determine the possible modules X (called Schofield submodules of Z) and then Y (called Schofield factors of Z), when Z is given. We present such an explicit procedure in the tame case, i.e when Q is Euclidean.
