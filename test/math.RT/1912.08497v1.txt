Let F be a non archimedian local field and H_n(F) the Shalika subgroup of GL_{2n}(F). We prove an explicit Plancherel formula for H_n(F) \backslash GL_{2n}(F) using the theory of Jacquet-Shalika of zeta functions and we deduce Plancherel decompositions for H_n(F) \backslash GL_{2n}(F) and GL_{n}(F) \times GL_{n}(F) \backslash GL_{2n}(F).
