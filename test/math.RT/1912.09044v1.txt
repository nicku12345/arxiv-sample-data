In this paper we study the Loewy structure of the center ZB of a block of a finite group with respect to an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic. We first state a new method for calculating the Loewy length LL(ZB) of ZB in terms of subsections and lower defect groups. By applying this result we give an upper bound of LL(ZB) which depends on the exponent of a defect group of B for some cases.
