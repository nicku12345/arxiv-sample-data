Let (\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{U}^\imath) be a quasi-split quantum symmetric pair of Kac-Moody type. The \imathquantum group \mathbf{U}^\imath admits a Serre presentation featuring the \imath-Serre relations in terms of \imath-divided powers. Generalizing this result, we give a Serre presentation  \mathbf{U}^\imath_\pi  of quantum symmetric pairs  (\mathbf{U}_\pi, \mathbf{U}^\imath_\pi)  for quantum covering algebras \mathbf{U}_\pi, which have an additional parameter  \pi  that specializes to the Lusztig quantum group when  \pi = 1  and quantum supergroups of anisotropic type when  \pi = -1 . We give a Serre presentation for  \mathbf{U}^\imath_\pi , introducing the \imath^\pi-Serre relations and \imath^\pi-divided powers.
