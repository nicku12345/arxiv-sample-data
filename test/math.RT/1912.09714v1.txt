The Malle-Navarro conjecture relates central block theoretic invariants in two inequalities. In this paper, we prove the conjecture for the 2-blocks and the unipotent 3-blocks of the general linear and unitary groups in non-defining characteristic. Moreover, we show that the conjecture holds for the unipotent 3-blocks of quotients of central subgroups of the special linear and unitary groups.
