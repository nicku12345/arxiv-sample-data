Kudryavtseva and Mazorchuk exhibited Schur-Weyl duality between the rook monoid algebra \mathbb{C}R_n and the subalgebra \mathbb{C}I_k of the partition algebra \mathbb{C} A_k(n) acting on (\mathbb{C}^n)^{\otimes k}. In this paper, we consider a subalgebra \mathbb{C}I_{k+\frac{1}{2}} of \mathbb{C} I_{k+1} such that there is Schur-Weyl duality between the actions of \mathbb{C} R_{n-1} and \mathbb{C} I_{k+\frac{1}{2}} on (\mathbb{C}^n)^{\otimes k}. This paper studies the representation theory of partition algebras \mathbb{C}I_k and \mathbb{C}I_{k+\frac{1}{2}} for rook monoids inductively by considering the multiplicity free tower \mathbb{C} I_1\subset \mathbb{C} I_{\frac{3}{2}}\subset \mathbb{C} I_{2}\subset \cdots\subset \mathbb{C} I_{k}\subset \mathbb{C} I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}\subset\cdots. Furthermore, this inductive approach is established as a spectral approach by describing the Jucys-Murphy elements and their actions on the canonical Gelfand-Tsetlin bases, determined by the aforementioned multiplicity free tower, of irreducible representations of \mathbb{C} I_k and \mathbb{C} I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}. Also, we describe the Jucys-Murphy elements of \mathbb{C} R_n which play a central role in the demonstration of the actions of Jucys-Murphy elements of \mathbb{C} I_k and \mathbb{C}I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}.
