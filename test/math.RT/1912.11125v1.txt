Let F/{\mathbb Q}_p be a finite extension. This paper is about continuous admissible p-adic Banach space representations \Pi of G = GL_n(F) and their restriction to H = SL_n(F). We first show that the restriction of any such absolutely irreducible G-representation decomposes as a finite direct sum of irreducible H-representations. Then we consider the restriction to SL_2({\mathbb Q}_p) of certain p-adic unitary Banach space representations of GL_2({\mathbb Q}_p), relying on the work of Colmez and Colmez-Dospinescu-Pa\v{s}k\={u}nas. It is shown that if \Pi is associated to an irreducible trianguline de Rham representation with distinct Hodge-Tate weights, then \Pi|_H decomposes non-trivially if and only if this is true for the subrepresentation (\Pi^{\rm lalg})|_H of locally algebraic vectors.
