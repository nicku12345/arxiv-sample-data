Let G be a finite abelian group acting on a path algebra kQ by permuting the vertices and preserving the arrowspans. Let W be a potential on the quiver Q which is fixed by the action. We study the skew group dg algebra \Gamma_{Q, W}G of the Ginzburg dg algebra of (Q, W). It is known that \Gamma_{Q, W}G is Morita equivalent to another Ginzburg dg algebra \Gamma_{Q_G, W_G}, whose quiver Q_G was constructed by Demonet. In this article we give an explicit construction of the potential W_G as a linear combination of cycles in Q_G, and write the Morita equivalence explicitly. As a corollary, we obtain functors between the cluster categories corresponding to the two quivers with potentials.
