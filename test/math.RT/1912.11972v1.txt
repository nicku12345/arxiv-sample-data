Let \psi : G\to GL(V) and \varphi :G \to GL (W) be representations of finite group G. A linear map T: V\to W is called a morphism from \psi to \varphi if it satisfys T\psi_g= \varphi_g T for each g\in G and let \mathrm{Hom}_G (\psi ,\varphi) denote the set of all morphisms. In this paper, we make full stufy of the subspace \mathrm{Hom}_G(\psi, \varphi). As byproducts, we include the proof of the first orthogonality relation and Schur's orthogonality relation.
