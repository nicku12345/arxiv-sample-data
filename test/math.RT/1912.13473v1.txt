Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic l\neq p. We construct maximal simple cuspidal k-types of Levi subgroups \mathrm{M}' of \mathrm{SL}_n(F), when F is a non-archimedean locally compact field of residual characteristic p. We show that the supercuspidal support of irreducible smooth k-representations of Levi subgroups \mathrm{M}' of \mathrm{SL}_n(F) is unique up to \mathrm{M}'-conjugation, when F is either a finite field of characteristic p or a non-archimedean locally compact field of residual characteristic p.
