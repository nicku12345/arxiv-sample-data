We present a very natural but yet useful criterion to detect vanishing of essential algebras of a Green biset functor A by means of morphisms. We introduce the morphisms Inf:A \rightarrow A_G and Res:A_G\rightarrow A to prove that the class of groups for which the essential algebras do not vanish is the same for A and any shifted functor A_G. We use the kernel of Res to give a characterization of the seeds of simple A_G-modules which are not obtained as pullback of simple A-modules.
