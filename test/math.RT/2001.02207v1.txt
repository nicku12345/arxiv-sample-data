We provide an explicit procedure to glue (not necessarily compact) silting objects along recollements of triangulated categories with coproducts having a 'nice' set of generators, namely, well generated triangulated categories. This procedure is compatible with gluing co-t-structures and it generalizes a result by Liu, Vit\'{o}ria and Yang. We provide conditions for our procedure to restrict to tilting objects and to silting and tilting modules. As applications, we retrieve the classification of silting modules over the Kronecker algebra and the classification of non-compact tilting sheaves over a weighted noncommutative regular projective curve of genus 0.
