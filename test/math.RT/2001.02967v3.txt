For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra \mathfrak{L} over \mathbb{C} with a fixed Levi decomposition \mathfrak{L} = \mathfrak{g} \oplus \mathfrak{r} where \mathfrak{g} is semi-simple, we investigate \mathfrak{L}-modules which decompose, as \mathfrak{g}-modules, into a direct sum of simple finite-dimensional \mathfrak{g}-modules with finite multiplicities. We call such modules \mathfrak{g}-Harish-Chandra modules. We give a complete classification of simple \mathfrak{g}-Harish-Chandra modules for the Takiff Lie algebra associated to \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}_2, and for the Schr\"{o}dinger Lie algebra, and obtain some partial results in other cases. An adapted version of Enright's and Arkhipov's completion functors plays a crucial role in our arguments. Moreover, we calculate the first extension groups of infinite-dimensional simple \mathfrak{g}-Harish-Chandra modules and their annihilators in the universal enveloping algebra, for the Takiff \mathfrak{sl}_2 and the Schr\"{o}dinger Lie algebra. In the general case, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of infinite-dimensional simple \mathfrak{g}-Harish-Chandra modules.
