The purpose of this Ph.D. thesis is to study and classify primitive ideals of the enveloping algebras U(\mathfrak{o}(\infty)) and U(\mathfrak{sp}(\infty)). Let \mathfrak{g}(\infty) denote any of the Lie algebras \mathfrak{o}(\infty) or \mathfrak{sp}(\infty). Then\break \mathfrak{g}(\infty)=\bigcup_{n\geq 2} \mathfrak{g}(2n) for \mathfrak{g}(2n)=\mathfrak{o}(2n) or \mathfrak{g}(2n)=\mathfrak{sp}(2n), respectively. We show that each primitive ideal I of U(\mathfrak{g}(\infty)) is weakly bounded, i.e., I\cap U(\mathfrak{g}(2n)) equals the intersection of annihilators of bounded weight \mathfrak{g}(2n)-modules. To every primitive ideal I of \mathfrak{g}(\infty) we attach a unique irreducible coherent local system of bounded ideals, which is an analog of a coherent local system of finite-dimensional modules, as introduced earlier by A. Zhilinskii. As a result, primitive ideals of U(\mathfrak{g}(\infty)) are parametrized by triples (x,y,Z) where x is a nonnegative integer, y is a nonnegative integer or half-integer, and Z is a Young diagram. In the case of \mathfrak{o}(\infty), each primitive ideal is integrable, and our classification reduces to a classification of integrable ideals going back to A. Zhilinskii, A. Penkov and I. Petukhov. In the case of \mathfrak{sp}(\infty), only 'half' of the primitive ideals are integrable, and nonintegrable primitive ideals correspond to triples (x,y,Z) where y is a half-integer.
