Let A_{m,n} be the tensor product of the Laurient polynomial algebra in m even variables and the exterior algebra in n odd variables over the complex field \bC, and the Witt superalgebra W_{m,n} be the Lie superalgebra of superderivations of A_{m,n}. In this paper, we classify the simple weight W_{m,n} modules with finite-dimensional weight spaces with respect to the standard Cartan algebra of W_{m,0}. Every such module is either a simple quotient of a tensor module or a module of highest weight type.
