We investigate a version of the Green correspondence for categories of complexes, including homotopy categories and derived categories. The correspondence is an equivalence between a category defined over a finite group G and the same for a subgroup H, often the normalizer of a p-subgroup of G. We present a basic formula for deciding when categories of modules or complexes have a Green correspondence and apply it to many examples. In several cases the equivalence is an equivalence of triangulated categories, and in special cases it is an equivalence of tensor triangulated categories.
