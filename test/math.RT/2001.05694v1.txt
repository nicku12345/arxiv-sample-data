This note is intended to reformulate the Dixmier-Malliavin theorem about smooth group representations in the language of bornological vector spaces, instead of topological vector spaces. This language turns out to allow a more general theorem to be proven, and we are able to use it to strengthen a result of Meyer from arXiv:math/0310094. This paper is based on a part of the author's thesis.
