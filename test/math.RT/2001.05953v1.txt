We prove the well-definedness of some deformations of the fibred biset category in characteristic zero. The method is to realize the fibred biset category and the deformations as the invariant parts of some categories whose compositions are given by simpler formulas. Those larger categories are constructed from a partial category of subcharacters by linearizing and introducing a cocycle.
