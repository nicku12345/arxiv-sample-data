We address the problem of classifying of irreducible Gelfand-Tsetlin modules for gl(m|n) and show that it reduces to the classification of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules for the even part. We also give an explicit tableaux construction and the irreducibility criterion for the class of quasi typical and quasi covariant Gelfand-Tsetlin modules which includes all essentially typical and covariant tensor finite dimensional modules. In the quasi typical case new irreducible representations are infinite dimensional gl(m|n)-modules which are isomorphic to the parabolically induced (Kac) modules.
