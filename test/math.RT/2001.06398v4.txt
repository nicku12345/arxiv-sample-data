There exists a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to the completion of the universal enveloping algebra of \widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(m|n), called the evaluation map. In this paper, we show that this homomorphism is surjective. Via the homomorphism, we obtain irreducible representations of the affine super Yangian.
