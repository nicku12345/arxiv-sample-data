Let \mathfrak{g} be a Borcherds-Bozec algebra, U(\mathfrak{g}) be its universal enveloping algebra and U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}) be the corresponding quantum Borcherds-Bozec algebra. We show that the classical limit of U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}) is isomorphic to U(\mathfrak{g}) as Hopf algebras. Thus U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}) can be regarded as a quantum deformation of U(\mathfrak{g}). We also give explicit formulas for the commutation relations among the generators of U_{q}(\mathfrak{g}).
