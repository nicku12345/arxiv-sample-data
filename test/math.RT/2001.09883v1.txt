Given a finite-dimensional algebra \Lambda and A \geqslant 1, we construct a new algebra \tilde{\Lambda}_A, called the stretched algebra, and relate the homological properties of \Lambda and \tilde{\Lambda}_A. We investigate Hochschild cohomology and the finiteness condition (Fg), and use stratifying ideals to show that \Lambda has (Fg) if and only if \tilde{\Lambda}_A has (Fg). We also consider projective resolutions and apply our results in the case where \Lambda is a d-Koszul algebra for some d \geqslant 2.
