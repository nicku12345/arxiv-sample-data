Let \mathfrak g be an affine Lie algebra with index set I = \{0, 1, 2, \cdots , n\}. It is conjectured in \cite{KNO} that for each Dynkin node k \in I \setminus \{0\} the affine Lie algebra \mathfrak g has a positive geometric crystal whose ultra-discretization is isomorphic to the limit of a coherent family of perfect crystals for the Langland dual {\mathfrak g} ^L. In this paper we show that at the spin node k=6, the family of perfect crystals given in \cite{KMN2} form a coherent family and show that its limit B^{6,\infty} is isomorphic to the ultra-discretization of the positive geometric crystal we constructed in \cite{MP} for the affine Lie algebra D_6^{(1)} which proves the conjecture in this case.
