The double Burnside R-algebra \text{B}_R(G,G) of a finite group G with coefficients in a commutative ring R has been introduced by S. Bouc. It is R-linearly generated by finite (G,G)-bisets, modulo a relation identifying disjoint union and sum. Its multiplication is induced by the tensor product. B. Masterson described \text{B}_{\mathbf{Q}}(\text{S}_3,\text{S}_3) as a subalgebra of \mathbf{Q}^{8\times 8}. We give a variant of this description and continue to describe \text{B}_R(\text{S}_3,\text{S}_3) for R\in\{\mathbf{Z},\mathbf{Z}_{(2)},\mathbf{F}_2,\mathbf{Z}_{(3)},\mathbf{F}_3\} via congruences as suborders of certain R-orders respectively via path algebras over R.
