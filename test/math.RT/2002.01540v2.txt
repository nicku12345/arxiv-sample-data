Let \mathfrak{g} be a complex semisimple Lie algebra. The Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem establishes an equivalence of the category of \mathfrak{g}-modules of a fixed infinitesimal character and a category of modules over a twisted sheaf of differential operators on the flag variety of \mathfrak{g}. In this expository paper, we give four detailed examples of this theorem when \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C}). Specifically, we describe the \mathcal{D}-modules associated to finite-dimensional irreducible \mathfrak{g}-modules, Verma modules, Whittaker modules, discrete series representations of SL(2,\mathbb{R}), and principal series representations of SL(2,\mathbb{R}).
