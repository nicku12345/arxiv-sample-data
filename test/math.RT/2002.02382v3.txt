In this paper we show that the Poisson analogue of the Noether's Problem has a positive solution for essentially all finite symplectic reflection groups - the analogue of complex reflection groups in the symplectic world. Our proofs are constructive, and generalize and refines previously known results. As an interesting consequence of the solution of this problem for complex reflection groups, we obtain the Poisson rationality of the Calogero-Moser spaces associated to any complex reflection group. The results of this paper can be thought as analogues of the Noncommutative Noether Problem and the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for rational Cherednik algebras in the 'quasi-classical limit'. In the second half of the paper, an abstract framework to understand these results is introduced, and it is shown that every Coloumb branch of a 3d \, \mathcal{N}=4 gauge theory is Poisson rational as an application. We also obtain the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for trigonometric Cherednik algebras and the Poisson rationality of their trigonometric Calogero-Moser spaces at the same time.
