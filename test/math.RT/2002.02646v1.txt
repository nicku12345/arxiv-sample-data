In this paper, we study modules for the Twisted Full Toroidal Lie Algebras (TFTLA). We define a category of bounded modules for TFTLA and classify all the irreducible modules in that category. A class of irreducible bounded modules are explicitly constructed by Michael Lau and Yuly Billig using Vertex operator algebras. We show that they exhaust all the irreducible bounded modules. Our plan is to describe the top spaces of the bounded irreducible modules for TFTLA and prove they in fact coincide with the top spaces of the modules constructed by Lau and Billig. When the top spaces become isomorphic then the corresponding irreducible modules are also isomorphic.
