We classify blocks in the BGG category \mathcal O of modules of non-integral weights for the exceptional Lie superalgebra D(2|1;\zeta). We establish various reduction methods, which connect some types of non-integral blocks of D(2|1;\zeta) with integral blocks of general linear Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{gl}{(1|1)} and \mathfrak{gl}{(2|1)}. We compute the characters for irreducible D(2|1;\zeta)-modules of non-integral weights in \mathcal O.
