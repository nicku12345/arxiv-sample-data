Let {\mathfrak g} be a complex simple Lie algebra with Borel subalgebra {\mathfrak b}. Consider the semidirect product I{\mathfrak b}={\mathfrak b}\ltimes{\mathfrak b}^*, where the dual {\mathfrak b}^* of {\mathfrak b}, is equipped with the coadjoint action of {\mathfrak b} and is considered as an abelian ideal of I{\mathfrak b}. We describe the automorphism group {\operatorname{Aut}}(I{\mathfrak b}) of the Lie algebra I{\mathfrak b}. In particular we prove that it contains the automorphism group of the extended Dynkin diagram of {\mathfrak b}. In type A_n, the dihedral subgroup was recently proved to be contained in {\operatorname{Aut}}(I{\mathfrak b}) by Dror Bar-Natan and Roland Van Der Veen in arXiv:2002.00697 (where I{\mathfrak b} is denoted by I{\mathfrak u}_n). Their construction is handmade and they ask for an explanation: this note fully answers the question.
