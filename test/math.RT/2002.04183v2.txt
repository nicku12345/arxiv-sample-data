In 2011, Guralnick and Tiep proved that if G was a Chevalley group and V an irreducible G-module in cross characteristic, then if V^B = 0, the dimension of H^1(G,V) is determined by the structure of the permutation module on a Borel subgroup B of G. We generalise this theorem to higher cohomology and an arbitrary finite group, so that if H \leq G such that O_{r'}(H) = O^r(H) then if V^H = 0 we show \dim H^1(G,V) is determined by the structure of the permutation module on H, and H^n(G,V) by \text{Ext}_G^{n-1}(V^*,M) for some M dependent on H. We also explicitly determine \text{Ext}_G^n(V,W) for all irreducible kG-modules V, W for G \in \{\text{PSL}_2(q), \text{PGL}_2(q), \text{SL}_2(q)\} in cross characteristic.
