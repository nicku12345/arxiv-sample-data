We provide a Lagrangian construction for the fixed-point subalgebra, together with its idempotent form, in a quasi-split symmetric pair of type A_{n-1}. This is obtained inside the limit of a projective system of Borel-Moore homologies of the Steinberg varieties of n-step isotropic flag varieties. Arising from the construction are a basis of homological origin for the idempotent form and a geometric realization of rational modules.
