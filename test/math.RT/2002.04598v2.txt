In this paper we define a regularized version of the analytic torsion for quotients of a symmetric space of non-positive curvature by arithmetic lattices. The definition is based on the study of the renormalized trace of the corresponding heat operators, which is defined as the geometric side of the Arthur trace formula applied to the heat kernel. Then we study the limiting behavior of the analytic torsion as the lattices run through a sequence of congrunece subgroups of a fixed arithmetic subgroup. Our main result states that for sequences of principal congruence subgroups, which converge to 1 at a fixed finite set of places and strongly acyclic flat bundles, the logarithm of the analytic torsion, devided by the index of the subgroup, converges to the L^2-analytic torsion.
