Let G be a simply connected simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0. The category of rational G-modules is not semisimple. We consider the question of when the tensor product of two simple G-modules L(\lambda) and L(\mu) is completely reducible. Using some technical results about weakly maximal vectors (i.e. maximal vectors for the action of the Frobenius kernel G_1 of G) in tensor products, we obtain a reduction to the case where the highest weights \lambda and \mu are p-restricted. In this case, we also prove that L(\lambda)\otimes L(\mu) is completely reducible as a G-module if and only if L(\lambda)\otimes L(\mu) is completely reducible as a G_1-module.
