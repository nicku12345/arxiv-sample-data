The main result here gives an algebra(/linear category) isomorphism between a geometrically defined subcategory J^1_0 of a short Brauer category J_0 and a certain one-parameter specialisation of the blob category b. That is, we prove the Conjecture in Remark 6.7 of [14]. We also define a sequence of generalisations J^i_{i-1} of the category J^1_0. The connection of J_0 with the blob category inspires a search for connections also with its beautiful representation theory. Here we obtain formulae determining the non-semisimplicity condition (generalising the classical `root-of-unity' condition).
