In this paper we study a generalisation of the Igusa-Todorov functions which gives rise to a vast class of algebras satisfying the finitistic dimension conjecture. This class of algebras is called Lat-Igusa-Todorov and includes, among others, the Igusa-Todorov algebras (defined by J. Wei) and the self-injective algebras which in general are not Igusa-Todorov algebras. Finally, some applications of the developed theory are given in order to relate the different homological dimensions which have been discussed through the paper.
