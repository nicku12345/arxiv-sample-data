This is an extended abstract of my talk at the Oberwolfach-Workshop "Representation Theory of Finite-Dimensional Algebras" (19-24 January 2020). It introduces a geometric orbifold model for the bounded derived category of a skew-gentle algebra. This is joint work with Daniel Labardini-Fragoso and Yadira Valdivieso-D\'iaz.
