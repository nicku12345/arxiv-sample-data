Let G be (the rational points of) a connected reductive group over a local non-archimedean field F. In this article we formulate and prove a property of an F-spherical homogeneous G-space (which in addition satisfies the finite multiplicity property, which is expected to hold for all F-spherical homogeneous G-spaces) which we call the Paley-Wiener property. This is much more elementary, but also contains much less information, than the recent relevant work of Delorme, Harinck and Sakellaridis (however, it holds for a wider class of spaces). The property results from a parallel categorical property. We also discuss how to define Bernstein morphisms via this approach.
