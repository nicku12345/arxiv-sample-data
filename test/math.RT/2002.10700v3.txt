For a semisimple complex Lie algebra \mathfrak g, the BGG category \mathcal O is of particular interest in representation theory. It is known that Irving's shuffling functors \mathrm{Sh}_w, indexed by elements w\in W of the Weyl group, induce an action of the braid group associated to W on the derived categories D^{\mathrm b}(\mathcal O_\lambda) of blocks of \mathcal O.   We show that for maximal parabolic subalgebras \mathfrak p of \mathfrak{sl}_n corresponding to the parabolic subgroup W_\mathfrak p=S_{n-1}\times S_1\leq S_n, the derived shuffling functors \mathbf L\mathrm{Sh}_{s_i} are instances of Seidel and Thomas' spherical twist functors. Namely, we show that certain parabolic indecomposable projectives P^\mathfrak p(w) are spherical objects, who give rise to so twist functors naturally isomorphic to \mathbf L\mathrm{Sh}_w[-1] as autoequivalences of D^\mathrm b(\mathcal O^\mathfrak p). We give a short and accessible overview of the main properties of the BGG category \mathcal O, the construction of shuffling- and spherical twist functors, and show some hands-on examples how to determine images of these. To do so, we shall make usage of the equivalence of blocks of \mathcal O with modules over some path algebra.
