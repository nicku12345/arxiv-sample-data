For any semisimple real Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}_\mathbb{R}, we classify the representations of \mathfrak{g}_\mathbb{R} that have at least one nonzero vector on which the centralizer of a Cartan subspace, also known as the centralizer of a maximal split torus, acts trivially. In the process, we revisit the notion of \mathfrak{g}-standard Young tableaux, introduced by Lakshmibai and studied by Littelmann, that provides a combinatorial model for the characters of the irreducible representations of any classical semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak{g}. We construct a new version of these objects, which differs from the old one for \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{so}(2r) and seems, in some sense, simpler and more natural.
