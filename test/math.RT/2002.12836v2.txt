The minimal representation of a semisimple Lie group is a 'small' infinite-dimensional irreducible unitary representation. It is thought to correspond to the minimal nilpotent coadjoint orbit in Kirillov's orbit philosophy. The Segal-Bargmann transform is an intertwining integral transformation between two different models of the minimal representation for Hermitian Lie groups of tube type. In this paper we construct a Fock model for the minimal representation of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}(m,2|2n). We also construct an integral transform which intertwines the Schr\"odinger model for the minimal representation of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}(m,2|2n) with this new Fock model.
