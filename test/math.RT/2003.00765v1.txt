Recently, Iwahori-Hecke algebras were associated to Kac-Moody groups over non-Archimedean local fields. In a previous paper, we introduced principal series representations for these algebras and partially generalized Kato's irreducibility criterion. In this paper, we study how some of these representations decompose when they are reducible and deduce information on the irreducible representations of these algebras.
