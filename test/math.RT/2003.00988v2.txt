The Lie algebra sl_2 ( \mathbb{C} ) may be regarded in a natural way as a subalgebra of the infinite-dimensional Virasoro Lie algebra, and this suggests there may be connections between the representation theory of the two algebras. In this paper, we explore the restriction to sl_2 ( \mathbb{C} ) of certain induced modules for the Virasoro algebra. Specifically, we consider Virasoro modules induced from so-called polynomial subalgebras, and we show that the restriction of these modules results in twisted versions of familiar modules such as Verma modules and Whittaker modules.
