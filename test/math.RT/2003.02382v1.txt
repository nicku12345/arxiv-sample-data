Motivated by the recent developments of the theory of Cherednik algebras in positive characteristic, we study rational Cherednik algebras with divided powers. In our research we have started with the simplest case, the rational Cherednik algebra of type A_1. We investigate its maximal divided power extensions over R[c] and R for arbitrary principal ideal domains R of characteristic zero. In these cases, we prove that the maximal divided power extensions are free modules over the base rings, and construct an explicit basis in the case of R[c]. In addition, we provide an abstract construction of the rational Cherednik algebra of type A_1 over an arbitrary ring, and prove that this generalization expands the rational Cherednik algebra to include all of the divided powers.
