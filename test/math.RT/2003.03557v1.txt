We determine the modular invariants of finite modular pseudo-reflection subgroups of the finite general linear group  \text{GL}_n(q)  acting on the tensor product of the symmetric algebra  S^{\bullet}(V)  and the exterior algebra  \wedge^{\bullet}(V)  of the natural  \text{GL}_n(q) -module  V . We are particularly interested in the case where  G  is a subgroup of the parabolic subgroups of  \text{GL}_n(q)  which is a generalization of Weyl group of Cartan type Lie algebra.
