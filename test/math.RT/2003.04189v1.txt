Let A be a finite dimensional representation-finite algebra over an algebraically closed field. The aim of this work is to determine which vertices of Q_A are suficient to be consider in order to compute the nilpotency index of the radical of the module category of A. In many cases, we give a formula to compute such index taking into account the ordinary quiver of the given algebra.
