We describe the ordinary characters of trivial source modules lying in blocks with cyclic defect groups relying on their recent classification in terms of paths on the Brauer tree by G.~Hiss and the second author. In particular, we show how to recover the exceptional constituents of such characters using the source algebra of the block.
