Assume that \mathbb F is an algebraically closed field and let q denote a nonzero scalar in \mathbb F that is not a root of unity. The universal DAHA (double affine Hecke algebra) \mathfrak H_q of type (C_1^\vee,C_1) is a unital associative \mathbb F-algebra defined by generators and relations. The generators are \{t_i^{\pm 1}\}_{i=0}^3 and the relations assert that \begin{gather*} t_it_i^{-1}=t_i^{-1} t_i=1 \quad \hbox{for all i=0,1,2,3}; \\ \hbox{t_i+t_i^{-1} is central} \quad \hbox{for all i=0,1,2,3}; \\ t_0t_1t_2t_3=q^{-1}. \end{gather*} In this paper we describe the finite-dimensional irreducible \mathfrak H_q-modules from many viewpoints and classify the finite-dimensional irreducible \mathfrak H_q-modules up to isomorphism. The proofs are carried out in the language of linear algebra.
