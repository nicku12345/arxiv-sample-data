The all Rota-Baxter algebra structures on the polynomial algebra R={\bf k}[x] are well known. We study the finite dimensional modules of polynomial Rota-Baxter algebras (\bfk[x],P) or (x {\bf k} [x],P) of weight nonzero since some cases of weight zero have been studied. The main result shows that every module over the polynomial Rota-Baxter algebra (\bfk[x],P) or (x {\bf k} [x],P) is equivalent to the modules over a plane {\bf k}\langle x,y \rangle/ I where I is some ideal of free algebra {\bf k}\langle x,y \rangle. Furthermore, we provide the classification of modules of polynomial Rota-Baxter algebras of weight nonzero through solution to some matrix equation.
