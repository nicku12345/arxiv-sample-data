Fragment and glider representations (introduced by F. Caenepeel, S. Nawal, and F. Van Oystaeyen) form a generalization of filtered modules over a filtered ring. Given a \Gamma-filtered ring FR and a subset \Lambda \subseteq \Gamma, we provide a category \operatorname{Glid}_\Lambda FR of glider representations, and show that it is a complete and cocomplete deflation quasi-abelian category. We discuss its derived category, and its subcategories of natural gliders and Noetherian gliders.   If R is a bialgebra over a field k and FR is a filtration by bialgebras, we show that \operatorname{Glid}_\Lambda FR is a monoidal category which is derived equivalent to the category of representations of a semi-Hopf category (in the sense of E. Batista, S. Caenepeel, and J. Vercruysse). We show that the monoidal category of glider representations associated to the one-step filtration k \cdot 1 \subseteq R of a bialgebra R is sufficient to recover the bialgebra R by recovering the usual fiber functor from \operatorname{Glid}_\Lambda FR. When applied to a group algebra kG, this shows that the monoidal category \operatorname{Glid}_\Lambda F(kG) alone is sufficient to distinguish even isocategorical groups.
