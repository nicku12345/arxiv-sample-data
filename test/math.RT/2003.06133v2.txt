A new formula is obtained for the holomorphic bi-differential operators on tube-type domains which are associated to the decomposition of the tensor product of two scalar holomorphic representations, thus generalizing the classical Rankin-Cohen brackets. The formula involves a family of polynomials of several variables which may be considered as a (weak) generalization of the classical Jacobi polynomials.
