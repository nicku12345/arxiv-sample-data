For a finite group G we investigate the smallest positive integer e(G) such that the map sending g\in G to e(G)|G:C_G(g)| is a generalized character of G. It turns out that e(G) is strongly influenced by local data, but behaves irregularly for non-abelian simple groups. We interpret e(G) as an elementary divisor of a certain non-negative integral matrix related to the character table of G. Our methods applied to Brauer characters also answers a recent question of Navarro: The p-Brauer character table of G determines |G|_{p'}.
