Let G be a real compact Lie group, such that G=G^0\rtimes C_2, with G^0 simple. Here G^0 is the connected component of G containing the identity and C_2 is the cyclic group of order 2. We give a criterion for whether an orthogonal representation \pi: G \to \mathrm{O}(V) lifts to \mathrm{Pin}(V) in terms of the highest weights of \pi. We also calculate the first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes of the representations of the Orthogonal groups.
