Let R be a right notherian ring. We introduce the concept of relative singularity category \Delta_{\mathcal{X}}(R) of R with respect to a contravariantly finite subcategory \mathcal{X} of \rm{mod}\mbox{-}R. Along with some finiteness conditions on \mathcal{X}, we prove that \Delta_{\mathcal{X}}(R) is triangle equivalent to a subcategory of the homotopy category \mathbb{K}_{\rm{ac}}(\mathcal{X}) of exact complexes over \mathcal{X}. As an application, a new description of the classical singularity category \mathbb{D}_{\rm{sg}}(R) is given. The relative singularity categories are applied to lift a stable equivalence between two suitable subcategories of the module categories of two given right notherian ring to get a singular equivalence between the rings. In different types of rings, including path rings, triangular matrix rings, trivial extension rings and tensor rings, we provide some consequences for their singularity categories.
