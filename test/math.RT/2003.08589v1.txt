Let A be a finite-dimensional algebra over a field k. We define A to be \mathbf{C}-dichotomic if it has the dichotomy property of the representation type on complexes of projective A-modules. \mathbf{C}-dichotomy implies the dichotomy properties of representation type on the levels of homotopy category and derived category. If k admits a finite separable field extension K/k such that K is algebraically closed, the real number field for example, we prove that A is \mathbf{C}-dichotomic. As a consequence, the second derived Brauer-Thrall type theorem holds for A, i.e., A is either derived discrete or strongly derived unbounded.
