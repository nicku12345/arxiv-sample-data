Let \mathfrak{g} be a simple classical Lie algebra over \mathbb{C} and G be the adjoint group. Consider a nilpotent element e\in \mathfrak{g}, and the adjoint orbit \mathbb{O}=Ge. The formal slices to the codimension 2 orbits in the closure \overline{\mathbb{O}}\subset \mathfrak{g} are well-known due to the work of Kraft and Procesi. In this paper, we prove a similar result for the universal G-equivariant cover \widetilde{\mathbb{O}} of \mathbb{O}. Namely, we describe the codimension 2 singularities for its affinization Spec(\mathbb{C}[\widetilde{\mathbb{O}}]).
