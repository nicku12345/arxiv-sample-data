We construct two supercharacter theories (in the sense of P. Diaconis and I.M. Isaacs) for the parabolic subgroups in orthogonal and symplectic groups. For each supercharacter theory, we obtain a supercharacter analog of the A.A.Kirillov formula for irreducible characters of finite unipotent groups.
