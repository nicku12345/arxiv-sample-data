We show that the signed p-Kostka numbers depend just on p-Kostka numbers and the multiplicities of projective indecomposable modules in certain signed Young permutation modules. We then examine the signed p-Kostka number k_{(\alpha|\beta),(\lambda|p\mu)} in the case when |\beta|=p|\mu|. This allows us to explicitly describe the multiplicities of direct summands of a signed Young permutation module lying in the principal block of F\mathfrak{S}_{mp} in terms of the p-Kostka numbers.
