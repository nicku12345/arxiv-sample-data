This is a sequel to the author's book "Derived Langlands" which introduced an embedding of the category of admissible representations of a locally p-adic group in to the derived category of the monomial category of the group. This article gives a reformulation in terms of the hyperHecke algebra and relates this viewpoint to a number of topics, including the Bernstein centre of the category of admissible representations.
