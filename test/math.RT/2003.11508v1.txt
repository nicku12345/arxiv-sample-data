The notion of a Harish-Chandra bimodule, i.e. finitely generated U(\mathfrak{g})-bimodule with locally finite adjoint action, was generalized to any filtered algebra in a work of Losev [Ivan Losev, Dimensions of irreducible modules over W-algebras and Goldie ranks. arXiv:1209.1083]. Similarly to the classical case we can define the notion of a unitarizable bimodule. We investigate a question when the regular bimodule, i.e. the algebra itself, for a deformation of Kleinian singularity of type A is unitarizable. We obtain a partial classification of unitarizable regular bimodules.
