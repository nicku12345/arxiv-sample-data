Ferdinand Georg Frobenius is generally considered the creator of character theory of finite groups. This achievement came from the study of the group determinant, which is the determinant of a matrix coming from the regular representation. In this paper, we generalize several of Frobenius' results about the group determinant and use them find a new formulation of supercharacter theory in terms of factorizations of the group determinant.
