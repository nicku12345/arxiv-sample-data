Let \mathbb{F} be a field of characteristic zero and let \mathfrak{g} be a non-zero finite-dimensional split semisimple Lie algebra with root system \Delta. Let \Gamma be a finite set of integral weights of \mathfrak{g} containing \Delta and \{0\}. Following [2,10], we say that a Lie algebra L over \mathbb{F} is \emph{generalized root graded}, or more exactly (\Gamma,\mathfrak{g})-\emph{graded}, if L contains a semisimple subalgebra isomorphic to \mathfrak{g}, the \mathfrak{g}-module L is the direct sum of its weight subspaces L_{\alpha} (\alpha\in\Gamma) and L is generated by all L_{\alpha} with \alpha\ne0 as a Lie algebra. Let \mathfrak{g}\cong sl_{n} and \[ \Theta_n = \{0,\pm\varepsilon_i \pm\varepsilon_j, \pm\varepsilon_i, \pm2\varepsilon_i \mid1 \leq i \neq j \leq n\} \] where \{\varepsilon_1, \dots, \varepsilon_n\} is the set of weights of the natural sl_{n}-module. In [9], we classify (\Theta_{n},sl_{n})-graded Lie algebras for n>4. In this paper we describe the multiplicative structures and the coordinate algebras of (\Theta_{n},sl_{n})-graded Lie algebras (n=3,4). In n=3, we assume that \[ [V(2\omega_{1})\otimes C,V(2\omega_{1})\otimes C]=[V(2\omega_{2})\otimes C',V(2\omega_{2})\otimes C']=0 \] where V(\omega) is the simple \mathfrak{g}-module of highest weight \omega, C={\rm Hom_{\mathfrak{g}}}(V(2\omega_{1}),L) and C'={\rm Hom_{\mathfrak{g}}}(V(2\omega_{2}),L) .
