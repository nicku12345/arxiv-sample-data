We construct a complex \mathcal{L}_\bullet^\lambda resolving the irreducible representations \mathcal{S}^{\lambda[n]} of the symmetric groups S_n by representations restricted from GL_n(k). This construction lifts to \mathrm{Rep}(S_\infty), where it yields injective resolutions of simple objects. It categorifies stable Specht polynomials, and allows us to understand evaluations of these polynomials for all n.
