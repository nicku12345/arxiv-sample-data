Let F be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We study the linear period problem for the pair (G,H_{p,p+1})=(GL_{2p+1}(F), GL_{p}(F)\times GL_{p+1}(F)) and we prove that any bi-H_{p,p+1}-invariant generalized function on G is invariant under the matrix transpose. We also show that any P\cap H_{p,p+1}-invariant linear functional on an H_{p,p+1}-distinguished irreducible smooth representation of G is also H_{p,p+1}-invariant, where P is a standard mirabolic subgroup of G with last row vector (0,\cdots,0,1).
