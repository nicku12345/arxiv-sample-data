For a Lie algebra {\mathcal L} with basis \{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n\}, its associated characteristic polynomial Q_{{\mathcal L}}(z) is the determinant of the linear pencil z_0I+z_1\text{ad} x_1+\cdots +z_n\text{ad} x_n. This paper shows that Q_{\mathcal L} is invariant under the automorphism group \text{Aut}({\mathcal L}). The zero variety and factorization of Q_{\mathcal L} reflect the structure of {\mathcal L}. In the case {\mathcal L} is solvable Q_{\mathcal L} is known to be a product of linear factors. This fact gives rise to the definition of spectral matrix and the Poincar\'{e} polynomial for solvable Lie algebras. Application is given to 1-dimensional extensions of nilpotent Lie algebras.
