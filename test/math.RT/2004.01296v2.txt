Let \mathbf{k} be an algebraically closed field. In this article, inspired by the description of indecomposable objects in the derived category of a gentle algebra obtained by V. Bekkert and H. A. Merklen, we define string complexes for a certain class \mathscr{C} of symmetric special biserial algebras, which are indecomposable perfect complexes in the corresponding derived category. We also prove that if \Lambda is a \mathbf{k}-algebra in the class \mathscr{C} and P^\bullet is a string complex over \Lambda, then P^\bullet lies in the rim of its Auslander-Reiten component.
