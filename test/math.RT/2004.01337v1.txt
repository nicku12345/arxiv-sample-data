Let G be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field and let W be its Weyl group. In a series of papers, Lusztig introduced a map from the set [W] of conjugacy classes of W to the set [G_u] of unipotent classes of G. This map, when restricted to the set of elliptic conjugacy classes [W_e] of W, is injective. In this paper, we show that Lusztig's map [W_e] \to [G_u] is order-reversing, with respect to the natural partial order on [W_e] arising from combinatorics and the natural partial order on [G_u] arising from geometry.
