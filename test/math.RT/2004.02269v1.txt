We present a new way to construct n-cluster tilting subcategories of abelian categories. Our method takes as input a direct system of abelian categories \mathcal{A}_i with certain subcategories and, under reasonable conditions, outputs an n-cluster tilting subcategory of an admissible target \mathcal{A} of the direct system. We apply this general method to a direct system of module categories \text{mod}\Lambda_i of representation-directed algebras \Lambda_i and obtain an n-cluster tilting subcategory \mathcal{M} of a module category \text{mod}\mathcal{C} of a locally bounded Krull-Schmidt category \mathcal{C}. In certain cases we also construct an admissible \mathbb{Z}-action of \mathcal{C}. Using a result of Darp\"o-Iyama, we obtain an n-cluster tilting subcategory of \text{mod}(\mathcal{C}/\mathbb{Z}) where \mathcal{C}/\mathbb{Z} is the corresponding orbit category. We show that in this case \text{mod}(\mathcal{C}/\mathbb{Z}) is equivalent to the module category of a finite-dimensional algebra. In this way we construct many new families of representation-finite algebras whose module categories admit n-cluster tilting modules.
