Let \mathfrak{g} be a basic simple Lie superalgebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and \theta an involution of \mathfrak{g} preserving a nondegenerate invariant form. We prove that either \theta or \delta\circ\theta admits an Iwasawa decomposition, where \delta is the canonical grading automorphism \delta(x)=(-1)^{\overline{x}}x. The proof uses the notion of generalized root systems as developed by Serganova, and follows from a more general result on centralizers of certain tori coming from semisimple automorphisms of the Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{g}.
