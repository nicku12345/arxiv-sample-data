Let G be a simple algebraic group in defining characteristic p>0, and let V be an irreducible G-module which is the tensor product of exactly two non-trivial modules. We obtain a criterion for V to have the zero weight. In addition, we provide a uniform criterion for an irreducible representation of a simple Lie algebra over the complex numbers to have a multiple of a prescribed fundamental weight.
