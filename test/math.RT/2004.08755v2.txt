The main purpose of the paper is to establish new tools in the study of \mathcal{O}^\mathfrak{p}. We introduce the Jantzen coefficients of generalized Verma modules. It comes from the Jantzen's simplicity criteria for generalized Verma modules and has a deep relation with the structure of \mathcal{O}^\mathfrak{p}. We develop a reduction process to compute those coefficients. For which we need to consider generalized Verma modules induced from maximal parabolic subalgebras having maximal nontrivial singularity, so called basic generalized Verma modules. The classification of such modules is obtained in this paper. As the first application of our results, we give a refinement of Jantzen's simplicity criteria.
