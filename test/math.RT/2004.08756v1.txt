The BGG category \mathcal{O} and its generalization \mathcal{O}^\mathfrak{p} play essential roles in representation theory and have led to far-reaching work. Some elementary problems remain open for several decades, such as the block decomposition of category \mathcal{O}^\mathfrak{p}. In this paper, we solve the problem of blocks by applying the theory of Jantzen coefficients.
