In this paper we give a sum formula for the radical filtration of generalized Verma modules in any (possibly singular) blocks of parabolic BGG category which can be viewed as a generalization of Jantzen sum formula for Verma modules in the usual BGG category \mathcal{O}. Combined with Jantzen coefficients, we determine the radical filtrations for all basic generalized Verma modules. The proof makes use of the graded version of parabolic BGG category. Explicit formulae for the graded decomposition numbers and inverse graded decomposition numbers of generalized Verma modules in any (possibly singular) integral blocks of the parabolic BGG category are also given.
