In the present paper, we introduce a class of infinite Lie conformal superalgebras \mathcal{S}(p), which are closely related to Lie conformal algebras of extended Block type defined in \cite{CHS}. Then all finite non-trivial irreducible conformal modules over \mathcal{S}(p) for p\in\C^* are completely classified. As an application, we also present the classifications of finite non-trivial irreducible conformal modules over finite quotient algebras \mathfrak{s}(n) for n\geq1 and \mathfrak{sh} which is isomorphic to a subalgebra of Lie conformal algebra of N=2 superconformal algebra. Moreover, as a generalized version of \mathcal{S}(p), the infinite Lie conformal superalgebras \mathcal{GS}(p) are constructed, which have a subalgebra isomorphic to the finite Lie conformal algebra of N=2 superconformal algebra.
