Let \mathscr{K}(G) be the rational cone generated by pairs (\lambda, \mu) where \lambda and \mu are dominant integral weights and \mu is a nontrivial weight space in the representation V_{\lambda} of G. We produce all extremal rays of \mathscr{K}(G) by considering the vertices of corresponding intersection polytopes IP_{\lambda}, the set of points in \mathscr{K}(G) with first coordinate \lambda. We show that vertices of IP_{\varpi_i} arise as lifts of vertices coming from cones \mathscr{K}(L) associated to simple Levi subgroups possessing the simple root \alpha_i. As corollaries we obtain a complete description of all extremal rays, as well as polynomial formulas describing the numbers of extremal rays depending on type and rank.
