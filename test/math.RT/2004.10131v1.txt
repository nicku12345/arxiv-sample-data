We show that the Green correspondence induces an injective group homomorphism from the linear source Picard group \mathcal{L}(B) of a block B of a finite group algebra to the linear source Picard group \mathcal{L}(C), where C is the Brauer correspondent of B. This homomorphism maps the trivial source Picard group \mathcal{T}(B) to the trivial source Picard group \mathcal{T}(C). We show further that the endopermutation source Picard group \mathcal{E}(B) is bounded in terms of the defect groups of B and that when B has a normal defect group \mathcal{E}(B)=\mathcal{L}(B). Finally we prove that the rank of any invertible B-bimodule is bounded by that of B.
