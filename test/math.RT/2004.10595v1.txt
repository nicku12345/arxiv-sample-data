Let \mathbb{X} be a weighted projective line and \mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X} the associated cluster category. It is known that \mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X} can be realized as a generalized cluster category of quiver with potential. In this note, under the assumption that \mathbb{X} has at most three weights or is of tubular type, we prove that if the generalized cluster category \mathcal{C}_{(Q,W)} of a Jacobi-finite non-degenerate quiver with potential (Q,W) shares a 2-CY tilted algebra with \mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X}, then \mathcal{C}_{(Q,W)} is triangle equivalent to \mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X}. As a byproduct, a 2-CY tilted algebra of \mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X} is determined by its quiver provided that \mathbb{X} has at most three weights. To this end, for any weighted projective line \mathbb{X} with at most three weights, we also obtain a realization of \mathcal{C}_\mathbb{X} via Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott's construction of 2-CY categories arising from preprojective algebras.
