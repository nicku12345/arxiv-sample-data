In the paper we investigate an algorithmic associative binary operation * on the set \mathcal{LR}_1 of Littlewood-Richardson tableaux with entries equal to one. We extend * to an algorithmic nonassociative binary operation on the set \mathcal{LR}_1\times \mathbb{N} and show that it is equivalent to the operation of taking the generic extensions of objects in the category of homomorphisms from semisimple nilpotent linear operators to nilpotent linear operators. Thus we get a combinatorial algorithm computing generic extensions in this category.
