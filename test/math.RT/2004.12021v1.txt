Support \tau-tilting modules correspond to some classes of categorical objects bijectively, such as two-term tilting complexes for any finite dimensional symmetric algebra.   This fact motivates us to classify support \tau-tilting modules over blocks of finite groups. Therefore we classify support \tau-tilting modules over particular blocks of finite groups by using the modular representation theoretical approaches including Clifford theory, Green's indecomposability theorem and so on.
