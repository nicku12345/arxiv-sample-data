In the first part of this article, we review a formalism of local zeta integrals attached to spherical reductive prehomogeneous vector spaces, which partially extends M. Sato's theory by incorporating the generalized matrix coefficients of admissible representations. We summarize the basic properties of these integrals such as the convergence, meromorphic continuation and an abstract functional equation. In the second part, we prove a generalization that accommodates certain non-spherical spaces. As an application, the resulting theory applies to the prehomogeneous vector space underlying Bhargava's cubes, which is also considered by F. Sato and Suzuki-Wakatsuki in their study of toric periods.
