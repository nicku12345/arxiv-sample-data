Let \Lambda,\Gamma be rings and R=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\Lambda & 0 \\ M & \Gamma\end{array}\right) the triangular matrix ring with M a (\Gamma,\Lambda)-bimodule. Let X be a right \Lambda-module and Y a right \Gamma-module. We prove that (X, 0)\oplus(Y\otimes_\Gamma M, Y) is a silting right R-module if and only if both X_{\Lambda} and Y_{\Gamma} are silting modules and Y\otimes_\Gamma M is generated by X. Furthermore, we prove that if \Lambda and \Gamma are finite dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field and X_{\Lambda} and Y_{\Gamma} are finitely generated, then (X, 0)\oplus(Y\otimes_\Gamma M, Y) is a support \tau-tilting R-module if and only if both X_{\Lambda} and Y_{\Gamma} are support \tau-tilting modules, \Hom_\Lambda(Y\otimes_\Gamma M,\tau X)=0 and \Hom_\Lambda(e\Lambda, Y\otimes_\Gamma M)=0 with e the maximal idempotent such that \Hom_\Lambda(e\Lambda, X)=0.
