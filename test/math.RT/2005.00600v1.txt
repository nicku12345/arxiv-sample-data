In this paper we show that the center of the partition algebra \mathcal{A}_{2k}(\delta), in the semisimple case, is given by the subalgebra of supersymmetric polynomials in the normalised Jucys-Murphy elements. For the non-semisimple case, such a subalgebra is shown to be central, and in particular it is large enough to recognise the block structure of \mathcal{A}_{2k}(\delta). This allows one to give an alternative description for when two simple \mathcal{A}_{2k}(\delta)-modules belong to the same block.
