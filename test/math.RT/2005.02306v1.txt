Let A be a standardly stratified algebra over a field K and T a tilting module over A. Let \Lambda^+ be an indexing set of all simple modules in A\lmod. We show that if there is an integer r\in\N such that for any \lambda\in\Lambda^+, there is an embedding \Delta(\lambda)\hookrightarrow T^{\oplus r} as well as an epimorphism T^{\oplus r}\twoheadrightarrow\overline{\nabla}(\lambda) as A-modules, then T is a faithful A-module and A has the double centraliser property with respect to T. As applications, we prove that if A is quasi-hereditary with a simple preserving duality and T a given faithful tilting A-module, then A has the double centralizer property with respect to T. This provides a simple and useful criterion which can be applied in many situations in algebraic Lie theory. We affirmatively answer a question of Mazorchuk and Stroppel by proving the existence of a unique minimal basic tilting module T over A for which A=\End_{\End_A(T)}(T). We also establish a Schur-Weyl duality between the symplectic Schur algebra S^{sy}(m,n) and \bb_{n}/\mathfrak{B}_{n}^{(f)} on V^{\otimes n}/V^{\otimes n}\mathfrak{B}_{n}^{(f)} when \cha K>\min\{n-f+m,n\}, where V is a 2m-dimensional symplectic space over K, \mathfrak{B}_{n}^{(f)} is the two-sided ideal of the Brauer algebra \bb_{n}(-2m) generated by e_1e_3\cdots e_{2f-1} with 1\leq f\leq [\frac{n}{2}].
