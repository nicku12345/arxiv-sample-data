For the discrete series representations of {\rm GL}(n) over a non-archimedean local field F, we define a notion of functions similar to "zonal spherical functions" for unramified principal series. We prove the existence of such functions in the level 0 case. As for unramified principal series, they give rise to explicit coefficients. We deduce a local proof of Matringe's criterion of distinction of discrete series, in the level 0 case, for the Galois symmetric space {\rm GL}(n,F)/{\rm GL}(n,F_0 ), for any unramified quadratic extension F/F_0. We also exhibit explicit test vectors when these representations are distinguished.
