We introduce the N=2 Lie conformal superalgebras {\frak {K}}(p) of Block type, and classify their finite irreducible conformal modules for any nonzero parameter p. where p is a nonzero complex number. In particular, we show that such a conformal module admits a nontrivial extension of a finite conformal module M over K_2 if p=-1 and M has rank (2+2), where K_2 is an N=2 conformal subalgebra of {\frak {K}}(p). As a byproduct, we obtain the classification of finite irreducible conformal modules over a series of finite Lie conformal superalgebras {\frak k}(n) for n\ge1. Composition factors of all the involved reducible conformal modules are also determined.
