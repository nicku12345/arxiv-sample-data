In this paper we provide, under some mild explicit assumptions, a geometric description of the category of representations of the centralizer of a regular unipotent element in a reductive algebraic group in terms of perverse sheaves on the Langlands dual affine flag variety. This equivalence is suggested and motivated by the "geometric Langlands" philosophy.
