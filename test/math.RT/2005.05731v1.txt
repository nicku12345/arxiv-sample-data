In [arXiv:1902.04063] we generalize the original definition of weighted surface algebras in [arXiv:1703.02346] by allowing the possibility that arrows might not be part of the Gabriel quiver, which gives a much larger class of algebras. This means that the zero relations need modification, to make sure that the algebras are symmetric, and of the appropriate dimension. We found recently that we had missed one necessary modification for the zero relations. Here we give the correct definition, and revise the parts of [arXiv:1902.04063] which are affected by this modification.
