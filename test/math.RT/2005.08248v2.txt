Bernstein, Frenkel and Khovanov have constructed a categorification of tensor products of the standard representation of \mathfrak{sl}_2 using singular blocks of category \mathcal{O} for \mathfrak{sl}_n. In earlier work, we construct a positive characteristic analogue using blocks of representations of \mathfrak{sl}_n over a field \textbf{k} of characteristic p > n, with zero Frobenius character, and singular Harish-Chandra character. In the present paper, we extend these results and construct a categorical \mathfrak{sl}_k-action, following Sussan's approach, by considering more singular blocks of modular representations of \mathfrak{sl}_n. We consider both zero and non-zero Frobenius central character. In the former setting, we construct a graded lift of these categorifications which are equivalent to a geometric construction of Cautis, Kamnitzer and Licata. We establish a Koszul duality between two geometric categorificatons constructed in their work, and resolve a conjecture of theirs. For non-zero Frobenius central characters, we show that the geometric approach to categorical symmetric Howe duality by Cautis and Kamnitzer can be used to construct a graded lift of our categorification using singular blocks of modular representations of \mathfrak{sl}_n.
