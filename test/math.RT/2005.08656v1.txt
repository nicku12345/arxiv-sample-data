We show that a finite dimensional algebra A has dominant dimension at least n \geq 2 if and only if the regular bimodule A is n-torsionfree if and only if A \cong \Omega^{n}(\text{Tr}(\Omega^{n-2}(V))) as A-bimodules, where V=\text{Hom}_A(D(A),A) is the canonical A-bimodule in the sense of \cite{FKY}. We apply this to give new formulas for the Hochschild homology and cohomology for algebras with dominant dimension at least two and show a new relation between the first Tachikawa conjecture, the Nakayama conjecture and Gorenstein homological algebra.
