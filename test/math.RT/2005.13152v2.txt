An enhanced algebraic group \uG of G=\GL(V) over \bbc is a product variety \GL(V)\times V, endowed with an enhanced cross product. Associated with a natural tensor representation of \uG, there are naturally Levi and parabolic Schur algebras \mathcal{L} and \mathcal{P} respectively. We precisely investigate their structures, and study the dualities on the enhanced tensor representations for variant groups and algebras. In this course, an algebraic model of so-called degenerate double Hecke algebras (DDHA) is produced, and becomes a powerful implement. The connection between \mathcal{L} and DDHA gives rise to two results for the classical representations of \GL(V): (i) A duality between \GL(V)\times\Gm and DDHA where \Gm is the one-dimensional multiplicative group; (ii) A branching duality formula. With aid of the above discussion, we further obtain a parabolic Schur-Weyl duality for \uG\rtimes \Gm. What is more, the parabolic Schur subalgebra turns out to have only one block. The Cartan invariants for this algebra are precisely determined.
