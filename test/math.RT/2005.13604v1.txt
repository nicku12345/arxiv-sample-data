In this paper we propose an alternative construction of a certain class of Deformed Double Current Algebras. We construct them as spherical subalgebras of symplectic reflection algebras in the Deligne category. They can also be thought of as ultraproducts of the corresponding spherical subalgebras in finite rank. We also provide new presentations of DDCA of types A and B by generators and relations.
