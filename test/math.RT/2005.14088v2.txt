In a previous work, the second-named author gave a complete description of the action of automorphisms on the ordinary irreducible characters of the finite symplectic groups. We generalise this in two directions. Firstly, using work of the first-named author, we give a complete description of the action of the Galois group on irreducible characters. Secondly, we extend both descriptions to cover the case of special orthogonal groups. As a consequence, we obtain explicit descriptions for the character fields of symplectic and special orthogonal groups.
