We formulate the transfer factor of character lifting from orthogonal groups to symplectic groups by Adams in the framework of symplectic Dirac cohomology for the Lie superalgebras and the Rittenberg-Scheunert correspondence of representations of the Lie superalgebra \fro\frsp(1|2n) and the Lie algebra \fro(2n+1). This leads to formulation of a direct lifting of characters from the linear symplectic group Sp(2n,\bbR) to its nonlinear covering metaplectic group Mp(2n,\bbR).
