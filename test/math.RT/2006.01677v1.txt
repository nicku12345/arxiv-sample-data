For a ring \Lambda with a Krull-Schmidt homotopy category, we study mutation theory on 2-term silting complexes. As a consequence, mutation works when \Lambda is a complete noetherian algebra, that is, a module-finite algebra over a commutative complete local noetherian ring R. By using results on 2-term silting complexes of such noetherian algebras and \tau-tilting theory of Artin algebras, we study torsion classes of the module category of a noetherian algebra. When R has Krull dimension one, the set of torsion classes of \Lambda is decomposed into subsets so that each subset bijectively corresponds to a certain subset of the set of torsion classes of Artin algebras.
