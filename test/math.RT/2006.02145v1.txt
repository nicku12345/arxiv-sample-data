We extend the classical result asserting that the twisting operator preserves certain Deligne--Lusztig character values for truncated formal power series; along the way we discuss some properties of centralisers. This leads us to the construction of an action of \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q[[\pi]]/\pi^r) on a Springer fibre intersected by Deligne--Lusztig varieties; we determine the primitivities of the induced cohomological representations for single cycles. The case of \mathrm{SL}_2 over finite dual numbers is presented with a criterion on semisimple orbit representations.
