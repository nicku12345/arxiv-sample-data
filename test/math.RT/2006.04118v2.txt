Let \pi_1,\ldots,\pi_k be smooth irreducible representations of p-adic general linear groups. We prove that the parabolic induction product \pi_1\times\cdots\times \pi_k has a unique irreducible quotient whose Langlands parameter is the sum of the parameters of all factors (cyclicity property), assuming that the same property holds for each of the products \pi_i\times \pi_j (i<j), and that for all but at most two representations \pi_i\times \pi_i remains irreducible (square-irreducibility property). Our technique applies the recently devised Kashiwara-Kim notion of a normal sequence of modules for quiver Hecke algebras.   Thus, a general cyclicity problem is reduced to the recent Lapid-M\'inguez conjectures on the maximal parabolic case.
