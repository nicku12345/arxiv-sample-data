In this paper we compute the number of n degree representations of a group of order p^3 for p an odd prime and the dimensions of corresponding spaces of invariant bilinear forms over an algebraically closed field F. We explicitly discuss about the existence of non-degenerate invariant bilinear forms. The results are important due to their application in the studies of physical sciences.
