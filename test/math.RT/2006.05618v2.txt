We classify all simple strong Harish-Chandra modules for the Lie superalgebra W(m,n). We show that every such module is either strongly cuspidal or a module of the highest weight type. We construct tensor modules for W(m,n), which are parametrized by simple finite-dimensional gl(m,n)-modules and show that every simple strongly cuspidal W(m,n)-module is a quotient of a tensor module. Finally, we realize modules of the highest weight type as simple quotients of the generalized Verma modules induced from tensor modules for W(m-1,n).
