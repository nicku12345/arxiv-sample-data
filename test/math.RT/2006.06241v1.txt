In this paper, we propose two maximal one-to-one sub-relations \underline\theta, \overline\theta of the Howe correspondence \Theta for a finite reductive dual pair consisting of a symplectic group and an orthogonal group. Moreover, we show that both the correspondences \underline\theta and \overline\theta are extensions beyond the stable range of the \eta-correspondence defined by Gurevich-Howe.
