Let \widetilde G be the nonlinear double cover of the real points of a connected, simply connected, semisimple complex group. In [Ts], we introduce a set of genuine small representations of \widetilde G with infinitesimal character \lambda, denoted \prod _\lambda ^s (\widetilde G). In this paper, we show that \prod _{\rho/2} ^s (\widetilde G) is precisely the set of genuine irreducible representations arising from the Kazhdan-Patterson lifting of the trivial representation, when \widetilde G is simply laced and split.
