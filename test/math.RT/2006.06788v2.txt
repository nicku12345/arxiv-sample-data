We determine the Verma multiplicities of standard filtrations of projective modules for integral atypical blocks in the BGG category \mathcal{O} for the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{osp}(3|4) by way of translation functors. We then explicitly determine the composition factor multiplicities of Verma modules using BGG reciprocity.
