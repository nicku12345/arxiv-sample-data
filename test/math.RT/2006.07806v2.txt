This paper studies scattered representations of G = SO(2n+1, \mathbb{C}), Sp(2n, \mathbb{C}) and SO(2n, \mathbb{C}), which lies in the `core' of the unitary spectrum G with nonzero Dirac cohomology. We describe the Zhelobenko parameters of these representations, count their cardinality, and determine their spin-lowest K-types. We also disprove a conjecture raised in 2015 asserting that the unitary dual can be obtained via parabolic induction from irreducible unitary representations with non-zero Dirac cohomology.
