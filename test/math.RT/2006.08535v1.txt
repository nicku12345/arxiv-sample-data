We state four open problems on Iwahori-Hecke algebras. The first one states a relation between some algebras appearing in Solleveld's work and some explicit Hecke algebras appearing in the study of unipotent representations. The second one is a boundedness conjecture. The third one is a conjecture of well-definedness of an asymptotic Hecke algebra. The fourth one concerns positive conjugacy classes in a Weyl group.
