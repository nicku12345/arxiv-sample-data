We construct a family of involutions on the space \mathfrak{gl}_n'(\mathbb C) of n\times n matrices with real eigenvalues interpolating the complex conjugation and the transpose. We deduce from it a stratified homeomorphism between the space of n\times n real matrices with real eigenvalues and the space of n\times n symmetric matrices with real eigenvalues, which restricts to a real analytic isomorphism between individual \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb R)-adjoint orbits and \mathrm{O}_n(\mathbb C)-adjoint orbits. We also establish similar results in more general settings of Lie algebras of classical types and quiver varieties. To this end, we prove a general result about involutions on hyper-K\"ahler quotients of linear spaces. We provide applications to the (generalized) Kostant-Sekiguchi correspondence, singularities of real and symmetric adjoint orbit closures, and Springer theory for real groups and symmetric spaces.
