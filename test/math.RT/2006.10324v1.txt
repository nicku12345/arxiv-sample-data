The affine group schemes of automorphisms of the multilinear r-fold cross products on finite-dimensional vectors spaces over fields of characteristic not two are determined. Gradings by abelian groups on these structures, that correspond to morphisms from diagonalizable group schemes into these group schemes of automorphisms, are completely classified, up to isomorphism.
