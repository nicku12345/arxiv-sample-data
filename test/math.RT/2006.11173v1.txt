We consider Donovan's conjecture in the context of blocks of groups G with defect group D and normal subgroups N \lhd G such that G=C_D(D\cap N)N, extending similar results for blocks with abelian defect groups. As an application we show that Donovan's conjecture holds for blocks with defect groups of the form Q_8 \times C_{2^n} or Q_8 \times Q_8 defined over a discrete valuation ring.
