We describe the cohomology of the sheaf of twisted differential operators on the quantized flag manifold at a root of unity whose order is a prime power. It follows from this and our previous results that for the De Concini-Kac type quantized enveloping algebra, where the parameter q is specialized to a root of unity whose order is a prime power, the number of irreducible modules with a certain specified central character coincides with the dimension of the total cohomology group of the corresponding Springer fiber. This gives a weak version of a conjecture of Lusztig concerning non-restricted representations of the quantized enveloping algebra.
