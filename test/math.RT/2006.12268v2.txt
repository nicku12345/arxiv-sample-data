We investigate the representations of the hyperalgebras associated to the map algebras \mathfrak g\otimes \mathcal A, where \mathfrak g is any finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra and \mathcal A is any associative commutative unitary algebra with a multiplicatively closed basis. We consider the natural definition of the local and global Weyl modules, and the Weyl functor for these algebras. Under certain conditions, we prove that these modules satisfy certain universal properties, and we also give conditions for the local or global Weyl modules to be finite-dimensional or finitely generated, respectively.
