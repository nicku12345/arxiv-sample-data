We describe the structure and properties of the finite-dimensional symmetric algebras over an algebraically closed field K which are socle equivalent to the general weighted surface algebras of triangulated surfaces, investigated in Erdmann and Skowro\'nski (J. Algebra 544:170-227, 2020). In particular, we prove that all these algebras are tame periodic algebras of period 4. The main results of this paper form an essential step towards a classification of all symmetric tame periodic algebras of period 4.
