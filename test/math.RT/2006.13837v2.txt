We construct blocks of finite groups with arbitrarily large Morita Frobenius numbers, an invariant which determines the size of the minimal field of definition of the associated basic algebra. This answers a question of Benson and Kessar. This also improves upon a result of the second author where arbitrarily large \mathcal{O}-Morita Frobenius numbers are constructed.
