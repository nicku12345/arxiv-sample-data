Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a finite field, and suppose G \leq \Gamma \mathrm{L}(V) is a group with a unique subnormal quasisimple subgroup E(G) that is absolutely irreducible on V. A base for G is a set of vectors B\subseteq V with pointwise stabiliser G_B=1. If G has a base of size 1, we say that it has a regular orbit on V. In this paper we investigate the minimal base size of groups G with E(G)/Z(E(G)) \cong \mathrm{PSL}_n(q) in defining characteristic, with an aim of classifying those with a regular orbit on V.
