Let k be an infinite field of positive characteristic. We determine all homomorphisms between Weyl modules for GLn(k), where one of the partitions is a hook. As a consequence we obtain a nonvanishing result concerning homomorphisms between Weyl modules for algebraic groups of type B, C and D when one of the partitions is a hook.
