We apply the notion of a full convex subcategory to a wide range of algebras including tilted, quasi-tilted, shod, weakly shod, left and right glued, laura, simply connected, strongly simply connected, left supported, and cluster-tilted. In particular, given an algebra \Lambda from one of the aforementioned classes, we investigate certain factor algebras \Lambda/I where I is an ideal generated by a suitable idempotent.
