We use the language of Lie pseudoalgebras to gain information about the representation theory of the simple infinite-dimensional linearly compact Lie superalgebra of exceptional type E(5,10). This technology allows us to prove that the degree of singular vectors in minimal Verma modules is \leq 14. A few technical adjustments allow us to refine the bound, proving that the degree must always be \leq 12 and it is actually, except for a finite number of cases, \leq 10.
