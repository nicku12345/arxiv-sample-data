The unitary dual of GL(n, \mathbb{R}) was classified by Vogan in the 1980s. Focusing on the irreducible unitary representations of GL(n, \mathbb{R}) with half-integral infinitesimal characters, we find that Speh representations and the special unipotent representations are building blocks. By looking at the K-types of them, and by using a Blattner-type formula, we obtain all the irreducible unitary (\mathfrak{g}, K)-modules with non-zero Dirac cohomology of GL(n, \mathbb{R}), as well as a formula for (one of) their spin-lowest K-types. Moreover, analogous to the GL(n,\mathbb{C}) case given in [DW1], we count the number of the FS-scattered representations of GL(n, \mathbb{R}).
