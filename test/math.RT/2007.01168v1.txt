Let (\mbox{mod} \Lambda',\mbox{mod} \Lambda,\mbox{mod} \Lambda'') be a recollement of module categories for artin algebras \Lambda', \Lambda and \Lambda''. We provide a sufficient condition such that a glued torsion pair in \mbox{mod} \Lambda is tilting when the given two torsion pairs are tilting in \mbox{mod} \Lambda' and \mbox{mod} \Lambda'' respectively. Using this result, we give a construction of gluing of tilting modules in \mbox{mod} \Lambda with respect to tilting modules in \mbox{mod} \Lambda' and \mbox{mod} \Lambda'' respectively.
