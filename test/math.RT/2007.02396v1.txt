Let G be a reductive group over a p-adic field F of characteristic zero, with p \gg 0. In [Kim04], J.-L. Kim studied an equivalence relation called weak associativity on the set of unrefined minimal K-types for G in the sense of A. Moy and G. Prasad. Following [Kim04], we attach to the set \(\overline{\mathfrak s}\) of good \(K\)-types in a weak associate class of positive-depth unrefined minimal K-types a G(F)-invariant open and closed subset \mathfrak g(F)_{\overline{\mathfrak s}} of the Lie algebra \mathfrak g(F) of G(F), and a subset \tilde G_{\overline{\mathfrak s}} of the admissible dual \(\tilde G\) of \(G(F)\) consisting of those representations containing an unrefined minimal K-type that belongs to \overline{\mathfrak s}. Then \(\tilde G_{\overline{\mathfrak s}}\) is the union of finitely many Bernstein components for G, so that we can consider the Bernstein projector E_{\overline{\mathfrak s}} that it determines. We show that E_{\overline{\mathfrak s}} vanishes outside the Moy--Prasad G(F)-domain G(F)_r \subset G(F), and reformulate a result of Kim as saying that the restriction of E_{\overline{\mathfrak s}} to G(F)_r, pushed forward via the logarithm to the Moy--Prasad G(F)-domain \mathfrak g(F)_r \subset \mathfrak g(F), agrees on \mathfrak g(F)_r with the inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic function of \mathfrak g(F)_{\overline{\mathfrak s}}. This is a variant of one of the descriptions given by R. Bezrukavnikov, D. Kazhdan and Y. Varshavsky in arXiv:1504.01353 for the depth-r Bernstein projector.
