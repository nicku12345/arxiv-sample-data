For a finite-dimensional associative algebra A, we introduce the notion of a self-injective core of A. Self-injective cores of A give rise to 2-subcategories of the 2-category of projective functors over A. We classify the simple transitive 2-representations of a wide class of such 2-subcategories. We also construct a family of non-cell simple transitive 2-representations of a certain 2-semicategory of projective functors. The existence of such 2-representations for a closely related 2-category was conjectured by Jakob Zimmermann.
