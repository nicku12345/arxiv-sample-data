ABSTRACT. Let \Phi be a finite dimensional K-algebra and let \mathscr{C} = \textrm{mod}\: \Phi be the abelian category of finitely generated right \Phi-modules. In their 1985 paper ``Modules determined by their composition factors'', Auslander and Reiten showed that under certain conditions modules in \textrm{mod}\: \Phi are determined by their composition factors, and show an important formula related to the Auslander-Reiten translation.   Let \mathscr{T} be a d-cluster tilting subcategory of \mathscr{C}, which by definition is also d-abelian. In this paper we will define the Grothendieck group for a d-abelian category, and show that the Grothendieck groups of \mathscr{C} and \mathscr{T} are isomorphic. We show also that under certain conditions, the indecomposable objects of \mathscr{T} are determined up to isomorphism by their composition factors in \mathscr{C}. Finally, we generalise the formula from Auslander and Reiten involving the higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten translation.
