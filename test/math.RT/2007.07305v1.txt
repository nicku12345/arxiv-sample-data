Let k be a field of characteristic 2 and let H be a finite group or group scheme. We show that the negative Tate cohomology ring \widehat{\text{H}}^{\leq 0}(H,k) can be realized as the endomorphism ring of the trivial module in a Verdier localization of the stable category of kG-modules for G an extension of H. This means in some cases that the endomorphism of the trivial module is a local ring with infinitely generated radical with square zero. This stands in stark contrast to some known calculations in which the endomorphism ring of the trivial module is the degree zero component of a localization of the cohomology ring of the group.
