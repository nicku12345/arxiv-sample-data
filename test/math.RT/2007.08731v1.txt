Given a quasi-reductive algebraic supergroup G, we use the theory of semisimplifications of symmetric monoidal categories to define a symmetric monoidal functor \Phi_x: \Rep(G) \to \Rep(OSp(1|2)) associated to any given element x \in \mathrm{Lie}(G)_{\bar 1}. For nilpotent elements x, we show that the functor \Phi_x can be defined using the Deligne filtration associated to x.   We use this approach to prove an analogue of the Jacobson-Morozov Lemma for algebraic supergroups. Namely, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on odd nilpotent elements x\in \mathrm{Lie}(G)_{\bar 1} which define an embedding of supergroups OSp(1|2)\to G so that x lies in the image of the corresponding Lie algebra homomorphism.
