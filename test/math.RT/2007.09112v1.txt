The conjugation action of the complex orthogonal group on the polynomial functions on n \times n matrices gives rise to a graded algebra of invariant polynomials. A spanning set of this algebra is in bijective correspondence to a set of unlabeled, cyclic graphs with directed edges equivalent under dihedral symmetries. When the degree of the invariants is n+1, we show that the dimension of the space of relations between the invariants grows linearly in n. Furthermore, we present two methods to obtain a basis of the space of relations. First, we construct a basis using an idempotent of the group algebra referred to as Young symmetrizers, but this quickly becomes computationally expensive as n increases. Thus, we propose a more computationally efficient method for this problem by repeatedly generating random matrices using a Monte Carlo algorithm.
