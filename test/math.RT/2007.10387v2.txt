Let F be a non-archimedean local field of residual characteristic p. Let \mathbb{G} be a reductive group defined over F which splits over a tamely ramified extension and set G=\mathbb{G}(F). We assume that p does not divide the order of the Weyl group of \mathbb{G}. Given a closed connected F-subgroup \mathbb{H} that contains the derived subgroup of \mathbb{G}, we study the restriction to H of an irreducible supercuspidal representation \pi=\pi_G(\Psi) of G, where \Psi is a G-datum as per the J.K. Yu Construction. We provide a full description of \pi|_H into irreducible components, with multiplicity, via a restriction of data which constructs H-data from \Psi. Analogously, we define a restriction of Kim-Yu types to study the restriction of irreducible representations of G which are not supercuspidal.
