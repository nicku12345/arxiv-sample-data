It is known that the \Theta-correspondence for a finite reductive dual pair is not one-to-one in general. In this paper, we propose two maximal one-to-one sub-relations \underline\theta,\overline\theta of the \Theta-correspondences for a finite dual pair of two unitary groups. These two correspondences are extensions of the analogue of the \eta-correspondence proposed by Gurevich-Howe.
