We study the PBW filtration on the Demazure modules V_{r_{\gamma}}(\lambda) associated to reflections r_{\gamma} at positive roots in type A_n, long roots \alpha_{i,\overline{i}} in type C_n, short roots \alpha_{i,n} in type B_n and the roots \alpha_{i,\overline{n}} in type D_n. In each type, we construct a normal polytope labelling a basis for the associated graded space \operatorname{gr} V_{r_{\gamma}}(\lambda) and prove that the annihilating ideal of \operatorname{gr} V_{r_{\gamma}}(\lambda) is a monomial ideal.
