We study Young's seminormal basis vectors of the dual Specht modules of the symmetric group, indexed by a certain class of standard tableaux, and their denominators. These vectors include those whose denominators control the splitting of the canonical morphism \Delta(\lambda+\mu) \to \Delta(\lambda) \otimes \Delta(\mu) over \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}, where \Delta(\nu) is the Weyl module of the classical Schur algebra labelled by \nu.
