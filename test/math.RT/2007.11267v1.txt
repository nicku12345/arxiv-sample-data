The parabolic category \mathcal{O} for affine {\mathfrak{gl}}_N at level -N-e admits a structure of a categorical representation of \widetilde{\mathfrak{sl}}_e with respect to some endofunctors E and F. This category contains a smaller category \mathbf{A} that categorifies the higher level Fock space. We prove that the functors E and F in the category \mathbf{A} are Koszul dual to Zuckerman functors.   The key point of the proof is to show that the functor F for the category \mathbf{A} at level -N-e can be decomposed in terms of the components of the functor F for the category \mathbf{A} at level -N-e-1. To prove this, we use the following fact: a category with an action of \widetilde{\mathfrak sl}_{e+1} contains a (canonically defined) subcategory with an action of \widetilde{\mathfrak sl}_{e}.   We also prove a general statement that says that in some general situation a functor that satisfies a list of axioms is automatically Koszul dual to some sort of Zuckerman functor.
