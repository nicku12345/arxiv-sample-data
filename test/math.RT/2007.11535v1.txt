The two most fundamental conjectures on the structure of the generic Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}(W) associated with a complex reflection group W state that \mathcal{H}(W) is a free module of rank |W| over its ring of definition, and that \mathcal{H}(W) admits a canonical symmetrising trace. The two most fundamental conjectures on the structure of the parabolic Hecke subalgebra \mathcal{H}(W') associated with a parabolic subgroup W' of W state that \mathcal{H}(W) is a free left and right \mathcal{H}(W')-module of rank |W|/|W'|, and that the canonical symmetrising trace of \mathcal{H}(W') is the restriction of the canonical symmetrising trace of \mathcal{H}(W) to \mathcal{H}(W'). We prove the last two conjectures for several exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups of rank 2.
