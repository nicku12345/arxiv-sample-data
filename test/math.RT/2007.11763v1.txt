Let F be a local non-Archimedean field of characteristic zero with a finite residue field. Based on Tadi\'{c}'s classification of the unitary dual of \mathrm{GL}_{2n}(F), we classify irreducible unitary representations of \mathrm{GL}_{2n}(F) that have nonzero linear periods, in terms of Speh representations that have nonzero periods. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a nonzero linear period for a Speh representation.
