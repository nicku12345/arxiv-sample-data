Let G be a complex, connected, reductive, algebraic group, and \chi:\mathbb{C}^\times \to G be a fixed cocharacter that defines a grading on \mathfrak{g}, the Lie algebra of G. Let G_0 be the centralizer of \chi(\mathbb{C}^\times). In this paper, we study G_0-equivariant parity sheaves on \mathfrak{g}_n, under some assumptions on the field \Bbbk and the group G. The assumption on G holds for GL_n and for any G, it recovers results of Lusztig in characteristic 0. The main result is that every parity sheaf occurs as a direct summand of the parabolic induction of some cuspidal pair.
