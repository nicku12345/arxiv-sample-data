We establish the inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition for simple groups of Lie type \mathsf C and the bad prime 2. As a main step, we derive a labelling set for the irreducible 2-Brauer characters of the finite symplectic groups Sp_{2n}(q) (with odd q), together with the action of automorphisms. As a further important ingredient we prove a Jordan decomposition for weights.
