Let K be an algebraically closed field with characteristic zero, and \mathfrak{g} a Lie algebra. Let Y(\mathfrak{g}) be the subalgebra of the symmetric algebra S(\mathfrak{g})=K[\mathfrak{g}^*] made of the polynomials which are invariant under the adjoint action. Also define Sy(\mathfrak{g}) as the algebra generated by elements of S(\mathfrak{g}) for which the adjoint action acts homothetically. When \mathfrak{q} is a parabolic contraction in type A or C, and in some cases in type B, Panyushev and Yakimova showed that the algebra of invariants Y(\mathfrak{q}) is an algebra of polynomials. Using Panyushev's and Yakimova's result, we show the polynomiality of Sy(\mathfrak{q}) by constructing an algebraically free set of generators in type A and in some cases in type C. We also study an example in type C where Sy(\mathfrak{q}) is not polynomial.
