For symmetric Kashiwara crystals of type A and rank e=2, and for the canonical basis elements that we call external, corresponding to weights on the outer skin of the Kashiwara crystal, we construct the canonical basis elements in a non-recursive manner. In particular, for a symmetric crystal with \Lambda=a \Lambda_0+a \Lambda_1, we give formulae for the canonical basis elements for all the e-regular multipartitions with defects either k(a-k) or k(a-k)+2a, for 0 \leq k \leq a.
