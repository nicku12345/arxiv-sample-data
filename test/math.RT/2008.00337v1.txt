We study the Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric functions associated to a root system of type BC and a multiplicity function which is allowed to assume some non-positive values (a standard multiplicity function). For such functions, we obtain positivity properties and sharp estimates which imply a characterization of the bounded hypergeometric functions. As an application, our results extend known properties of Harish-Chandra's spherical functions on Riemannian symmetric spaces of the non-compact type G/K to spherical functions over homogeneous vector bundles on G/K which are associated to certain small K-types.
