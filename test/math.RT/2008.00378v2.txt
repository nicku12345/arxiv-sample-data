In this paper we show three new results concerning dimension datum. Firstly, for two subgroups H_{1}(\cong U(2n+1)) and H_{2}(\cong Sp(n)\times SO(2n+2)) of SU(4n+2), we find a family of pairs of irreducible representations (\tau_1,\tau_2)\in\hat{H_{1}}\times\hat{H_{2}} such that \mathscr{D}_{H_1,\tau_1}=\mathscr{D}_{H_2,\tau_2}. With this we construct examples of isospectral hermitian vector bundles. Secondly, we show that: \tau-dimension data of one-dimensional representations of a connected compact Lie group H determine the image of homomorphism from H to a given compact Lie group G. Lastly, we improve a compactness result for an isospectral set of normal homogeneous spaces (G/H,m) by allowing the Riemannian metric m vary, but posing a constraint that G is semisimple.
