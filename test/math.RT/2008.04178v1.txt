Let \mathcal{M} be an n-cluster tilting subcategory of {\rm mod}\mbox{-}\Lambda, where \Lambda is an artin algebra. Let \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{M}) denotes the full subcategory of \mathcal{S}(\Lambda), the submodule category of \Lambda, consisting of all monomorphisms in \mathcal{M}. We construct two functors from \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{M}) to {\rm mod}\mbox{-}\underline{\mathcal{M}}, the category of finitely presented (coherent) additive contravariant functors on the stable category of \mathcal{M}. We show that these functors are full, dense and objective. So they induce equivalences from the quotient categories of the submodule category of \mathcal{M} modulo their respective kernels. Moreover, they are related by a syzygy functor on the stable category of {\rm mod}\mbox{-}\underline{\mathcal{M}}. These functors can be considered as a higher version of the two functors studied by Ringel and Zhang [RZ] in the case \Lambda=k[x]/{\langle x^n \rangle} and generalized later by Eir\'{i}ksson [E] to self-injective artin algebras. Several applications will be provided.
