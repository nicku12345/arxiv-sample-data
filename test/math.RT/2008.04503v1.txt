For a finite field extension F/\mathbb{Q}_p we associate a coefficient system attached on the Bruhat-Tits tree of G:= {\rm GL}_2(F) to a locally analytic representation V of G. This is done in analogy to the work of Schneider and Stuhler for smooth representations. This coefficient system furnishes a chain-complex which is shown, in the case of locally analytic principal series representations V, to be a resolution of V.
