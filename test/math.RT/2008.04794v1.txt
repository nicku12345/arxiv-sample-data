Let X be an affine, smooth, and Noetherian scheme over \mathbb{C} acted on by an affine algebraic group G. Applying the technique developed in Arkhipov and {\O}rsted (2018a, 2018b), we define a dg-model for the derived category of dg-modules over the dg-algebra of differential forms \Omega_X on X equivariant with respect to the action of a derived group scheme (G ,\Omega_G ). We compare the obtained dg-category with the one considered in Arkhipov and Kanstrup (2015) given by coherent sheaves on the derived Hamiltonian reduction of T^* X.
