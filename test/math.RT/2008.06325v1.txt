This is Part IV of a thematic series currently consisting of a monograph and four essays. This essay examines the form of induced representations of locally p-adic Lie groups G which is appropriate for the abelian category of {\mathcal M}_{c}(G)-admissible representations. In my non-expert manner, I prove the analogue of Jacquet's Theorem in this category. The final section consists of observations and questions related to this and other concepts introduced in the course of this series.
