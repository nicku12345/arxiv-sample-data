We describe all blocks of the category of finite-dimensional \mathfrak{q}(3)-supermodules by providing their extension quivers. We also obtain two general results about the representation of \mathfrak{q}(n): we show that the Ext quiver of the standard block of \mathfrak{q}(n) is obtained from the principal block of \mathfrak{q}(n-1) by identifying certain vertices of the quiver and prove a ''virtual'' BGG-reciprocity for \mathfrak{q}(n). The latter result is used to compute the radical filtrations of \mathfrak{q}(3) projective covers.
