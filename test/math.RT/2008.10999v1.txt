In this paper we investigate blocks of symmetric groups of weight 2 over fields of odd characteristic p. We develop an algorithm that relates the quivers of two such blocks forming a (2:1) pair, as introduced by Scopes. We then apply the algorithm to blocks whose p-cores are hook partitions, in order to explicitly determine the quivers of these blocks. As a consequence we conclude that two p-blocks B_1 and B_2 of symmetric groups of weight 2 whose p-cores are hook partitions are Morita equivalent if and only if B_2 or its conjugate block is in the same Scopes class as B_1.
