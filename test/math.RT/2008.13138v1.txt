We define and investigate algebraic torus actions on quiver Grassmannians for nilpotent representations of the equioriented cycle. Examples of such varieties are type \tt A flag varieties, their linear degenerations, finite dimensional approximations of the GL_n-affine flag variety and affine Grassmannian. We show that these quiver Grassmannians, equipped with our torus action, are GKM-varieties and that their moment graph admits a combinatorial description in terms of coefficients quiver of the underlying quiver representations. By adapting to our setting results by Gonzales, we are able to prove that moment graph techniques can be applied to construct module bases for the equivariant cohomology of the above quiver Grassmannians.
