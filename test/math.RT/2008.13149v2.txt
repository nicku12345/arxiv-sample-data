We describe graded commutative Gorenstein algebras {\mathcal E}_n(p) over a field of characteristic p, and we conjecture that \mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathsf{Ver}_{p^{n+1}}}(1,1)\cong{\mathcal E}_{n}(p), where \mathsf{Ver}_{p^{n+1}} are the new symmetric tensor categories recently constructed in \cite{Benson/Etingof:2019a,Benson/Etingof/Ostrik,Coulembier}. We investigate the combinatorics of these algebras, and the relationship with Minc's partition function, as well as possible actions of the Steenrod operations on them.   Evidence for the conjecture includes a large number of computations for small values of n. We also provide some theoretical evidence. Namely, we use a Koszul construction to identify a homogeneous system of parameters in {\mathcal E}_n(p) with a homogeneous system of parameters in \mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathsf{Ver}_{p^{n+1}}}(1,1). These parameters have degrees 2^i-1 if p=2 and 2(p^i-1) if p is odd, for 1\le i \le n. This at least shows that \mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathsf{Ver}_{p^{n+1}}}(1,1) is a finitely generated graded commutative algebra with the same Krull dimension as {\mathcal E}_n(p). For p=2 we also show that \mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathsf{Ver}_{2^{n+1}}}(1,1) has the expected rank 2^{n(n-1)/2} as a module over the subalgebra of parameters.
