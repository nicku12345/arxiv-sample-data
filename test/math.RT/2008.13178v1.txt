We study invariant Hermitian forms on a conformal vertex algebra and on their (twisted) modules. We establish existence of a non-zero invariant Hermitian form on an arbitrary W-algebra. We show that for a minimal simple W-algebra W_k(\mathfrak g,\theta/2) this form can be unitary only when its \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb Z-grading is compatible with parity, unless W_k(\mathfrak g,\theta/2) ''collapses'' to its affine subalgebra.
