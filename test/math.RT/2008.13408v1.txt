By the Fourier transformations, any group-invariant functions over finite Abelian groups are transformed into group-invariant functions over the character groups. In this paper, we calculate matrix elements of this transformations under specific bases. More specifically, we deal with some vector spaces over a finite field and linear actions. Then the matrix elements under adequate bases are expressed by Krawtchouk or Affine q-Krawtchouk polynomials. For calculations, we construct a commutative diagram which combines two settings of group-invariant Fourier transformations. We apply it to different sized transformations of each example, and solve it inductively. We remark the matrix elements are related to the zonal spherical functions of finite Gelfand pairs.
