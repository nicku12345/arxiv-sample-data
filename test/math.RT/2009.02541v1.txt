We study corners and fundamental corners of the irreducible representations of the groups G=Spin(n,1) that are not elementary, i.e. that are equivalent to subquotients of reducible nonunitary principal series representations. For even n we obtain results in a way analogous to the results in [10] for the groups SU(n,1). Especially, we again get a bijection between the nonelementary part \hat{G}^0 of the unitary dual \hat{G} and the unitary dual \hat{K}. In the case of odd n we get a bijection between \hat{G}^0 and a tru subset of \hat{K}.
