We prove that any cyclic Nakayama algebra which is higher Auslander algebra can be uniquely constructed from Nakayama algebras of smaller ranks by reversing syzygy filtration process. This creates chains of higher Auslander algebras upto \varepsilon-equivalences. There are two applications of this: for any integer k where 2\leq k\leq 2n-2, there is a Nakayama algebra of rank n which is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension k and the possible values of global dimensions of cyclic Nakayama algebras which are higher Auslander algebras form the sets \left\{2,\ldots,2n-2\right\}\setminus\left\{n-1\right\} if n is even and \left\{2,\ldots,2n-2\right\}\setminus\left\{ 2,n-1\right\} if n is odd.
