We study the deformation of the Howe dual pairs (\mathrm{U}(n),\mathfrak{u}(1,1)) and (\mathrm{U}(n),\mathfrak{u}(2|1)) to the context of a rational Cherednik algebra H_{1,c}(G,E) associated with a real reflection group G acting on a real vector space E of even dimension. For the case where E is two-dimensional and G is a dihedral group, we provide complete descriptions for the deformed pair and the relevant joint-decomposition of the standard module or its tensor product with a spinor space.
