Let \mathfrak{g} be a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over \mathbb{C}, and let Y_{\hbar}(\mathfrak{g}) be the Yangian of \mathfrak{g}. In this paper, we initiate the study of the set of poles of the rational currents defining the action of Y_{\hbar}(\mathfrak{g}) on an arbitrary finite-dimensional vector space V. We prove that this set is completely determined by the eigenvalues of the commuting Cartan currents of Y_{\hbar}(\mathfrak{g}), and therefore encodes the singularities of the components of the q-character of V. Furthermore, we obtain sufficient conditions for a tensor product of finite-dimensional irreducible representations to be cyclic and irreducible, in terms of these sets of poles. In type \mathsf{A}, we explicitly determine the set of poles of every irreducible V in terms of the roots of the underlying Drinfeld polynomials. In particular, our results yield a complete classification of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Yangian double in type \mathsf{A}. We also give a conjectural description of these sets in types \mathsf{ADE}, in terms of the inverse of the corresponding q-Cartan matrix.
