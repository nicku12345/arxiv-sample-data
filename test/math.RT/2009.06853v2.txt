In this paper, a class of super Heisenberg-Virasoro algebras is introduced on the base of conformal modules of Lie conformal superalgebras.   Then we construct a class of simple super Heisenberg-Virasoro modules, which is induced from simple modules of the finite-dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras.   These modules are isomorphic to simple restricted super Heisenberg-Virasoro modules, and include the highest weight modules, Whittaker modules and high order Whittaker modules.
