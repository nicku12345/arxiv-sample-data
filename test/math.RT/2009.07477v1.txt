We study the interaction between the block decompositions of reduced universal enveloping algebras in positive characteristic, the PBW filtration, and the nilpotent cone. We provide two natural versions of the PBW filtration on the block subalgebra A_\lambda of the restricted universal enveloping algebra \mathcal{U}_\chi(\mathfrak{g}) and show these are dual to each other. We also consider shifted PBW filtration for which we relate the associated graded algebra to the algebra of functions on the Frobenius neighbourhood of 0 in the nilpotent cone and the coinvariants algebra corresponding to \lambda. In the case of \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2(k) in characteristic p>2 we, moreover, determine the associated graded algebras of these filtrations on block subalgebras of \mathcal{U}_0(\mathfrak{sl}_2) and their structure as \mathrm{SL}_2-representations. We use this to deduce the \mathrm{SL}_2-module structure of block subalgebras in this case.
