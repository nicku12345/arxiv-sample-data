For any subset \Theta of the natural numbers and any dominant weight \lambda we construct an indecomposable module S_\Theta(\lambda) with maximal weight \lambda for the quantum group U_{{\mathscr Z}_{\mathfrak p}}, where {\mathscr Z}_{\mathfrak p} is a quantum version of the p-adic integers. For \Theta=\emptyset we obtain the Weyl module, for \Theta=\mathbb N we obtain the indecomposable tilting module. Each S_\Theta(\lambda) admits a Weyl filtration, and for l\in\Theta the character of S_\Theta(\lambda) equals the character of an (in general decomposable) tilting module for the quantum group at a primitive p^l-th root of unity.
