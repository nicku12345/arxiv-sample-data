It is a remarkable theorem by Maffei--Nakajima that the Slodowy variety, which consists of certain complete flags, can be realized as certain Nakajima quiver variety of type A. However, the isomorphism is rather implicit as it takes to solve a system of equations in which variables are linear maps. In this paper, we construct solutions to this system and thus establish an explicit and efficient way to realize these quiver varieties in terms of complete flags in the corresponding Slodowy varieties. As Slodowy varieties contain Springer fibers naturally, we further provide an explicit description of irreducible components of two-row Springer fibers in terms of a family of kernel relations via quiver representations, which allows us to formulate a characterization of irreducible components of Springer fibers of classical type.
