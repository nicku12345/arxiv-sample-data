In this paper, we first construct the twisted full toroidal Lie algebra by an extension of a centreless Lie torus LT which is a multiloop algebra twisted by several automorphisms of finite order and equipped with a particular grading. We then provide a complete classification of all the irreducible integrable modules with finite dimensional weight spaces for this twisted full toroidal Lie algebra having a non-trivial LT-action and where the centre of the underlying Lie algebra acts trivially.
