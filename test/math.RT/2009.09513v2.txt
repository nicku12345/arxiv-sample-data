We prove the rationality of the exceptional W-algebras associated with the simple Lie algebra \mathfrak{sp}_4 and subregular nilpotent elements, proving a new particular case of a conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto. Moreover, we describe the simple \mathcal{W}_k(\mathfrak{sp}_4,f_{subreg})-modules and compute their characters. We also explicit the nontrivial action of the component group on the set of these simple modules.
