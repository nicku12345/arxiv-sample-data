Let \mathcal{O}_2 and \mathcal{O}'_2 be two distinct finite local rings of length two with residue field of characteristic p. Let \mathbb{G}(\mathcal{O}_2) and \mathbb{G}(\mathcal{O}'_2), be the group of points of any reductive group scheme \mathbb{G} over \mathbb{Z} such that p is very good for \mathbb{G} \times \mathbb{F}_q. We prove that there exists an isomorphism of group algebra K[\mathbb{G}(\mathcal{O}_2)] \cong K[\mathbb{G}(\mathcal{O}'_2)], where K is a sufficiently large field of characteristic different from p.
