Let A_{m,n} be the tensor product of the polynomial algebra in m even variables and the exterior algebra in n odd variables over the complex field \C, and the Witt superalgebra W_{m,n} be the Lie superalgebra of superderivations of A_{m,n}. In this paper, we classify the non-trivial simple bounded weight W_{m,n} modules with respect to the standard Cartan algebra of W_{m,n}. Any such module is a simple quotient of a tensor module F(P,L(V_1\otimes V_2)) for a simple weight module P over the Weyl superalgebra \mathcal K_{m,n}, a finite-dimensional simple \gl_m-module V_1 and a simple bounded \gl_n-module V_2.
