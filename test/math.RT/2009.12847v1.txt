Suppose V is a finite dimensional, complex vector space, A is a finite set of codimension one subspaces of V, and G is a finite subgroup of the general linear group GL(V) that permutes the hyperplanes in A. In this paper we study invariants and semi-invariants in the graded QG-module H^*(M(A)), where M(A) denotes the complement in V of the hyperplanes in A and H^* denotes rational singular cohomology, in the case when G is generated by reflections in V and A is the set of reflecting hyperplanes determined by G, or a closely related arrangement. Our first main result is the construction of an explicit, natural (from the point of view of Coxeter groups) basis of the space of invariants, H^*(M(A))^G. In addition to providing a conceptual proof of a conjecture due to Felder and Veselov for Coxeter groups, this result extends the latter to all finite complex reflection groups. Moreover, we prove that determinant-like characters of complex reflection groups do not occur in H^*(M(A)). This extends to all finite complex reflection groups a result proved for Weyl groups by Lehrer.
