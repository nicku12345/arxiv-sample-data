An irreducible character of a finite group G is called quasi p-Steinberg character for a prime p if it takes a nonzero value on every p-regular element of G. In this article, we classify the quasi p-Steinberg characters of Symmetric (S_n) and Alternating (A_n) groups and their double covers. In particular, an existence of a non-linear quasi p-Steinberg character of S_n implies n \leq 8 and of A_n implies n \leq 9.
