Two matrix vector spaces V,W\subset \mathbb C^{n\times n} are said to be equivalent if SVR=W for some nonsingular S and R. These spaces are congruent if R=S^T. We prove that if all matrices in V and W are symmetric, or all matrices in V and W are skew-symmetric, then V and W are congruent if and only if they are equivalent. Let F: U\times\dots\times U\to V and G: U'\times\dots\times U'\to V' be symmetric or skew-symmetric k-linear maps over \mathbb C. If there exists a set of linear bijections \varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_k:U\to U' and \psi:V\to V' that transforms F to G, then there exists such a set with \varphi_1=\dots=\varphi_k.
