Koornwinder polynomials are q-orthogonal polynomials equipped with extra five parameters and the B C_n-type Weyl group symmetry, which were introduced by Koornwinder (1992) as multivariate analogue of Askey-Wilson polynomials. They are now understood as the Macdonald polynomials associated to the affine root system of type (C^\vee_n,C_n) via the Macdonald-Cherednik theory of double affine Hecke algebras. In this paper we give explicit formulas of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for Koornwinder polynomials, i.e., the structure constants of the product as invariant polynomials. Our formulas are natural (C^\vee_n,C_n)-analogue of Yip's alcove-walk formulas (2012) which were given in the case of reduced affine root systems.
