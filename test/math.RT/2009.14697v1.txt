This is the fifth article in the Derived Langlands series which consists of one monograph and four articles. In this article I describe the Hopf algebra and Positive Selfadjoint Hopfalgebra (PSH) aspects to classification of a number of new classes of presentations and admissibility which have appeared earlier in the series. The paper begins with a very estensive. partly hypothetical, of the synthesis of the entire series. Many of the proofs and ideas in this series are intended to be suggestive rather than the finished definitive product for extenuating circumstances explained therein.
