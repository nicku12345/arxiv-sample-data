In this paper, we obtain explicit branching laws for all unitary representations of \operatorname{Spin}(N,1) restricted to a parabolic subgroup P. The restriction turns out to be a finite direct sum of irreducible unitary representations of P. We also verify Duflo's conjecture for the branching law of tempered representations of \operatorname{Spin}(N,1) with respect to a minimal parabolic subgroup P. That is to show: in the framework of orbit method, the branching law of a tempered representation is determined by the behavior of the moment map from the corresponding coadjoint orbit. A few key tools used in this work include: Fourier transform, Knapp-Stein intertwining operators, Casselman-Wallach globalization, Zuckerman translation principle, du Cloux's result of smooth representations for semi-algebraic groups.
