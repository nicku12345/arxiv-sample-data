In this paper we study the determinant of irreducible representations of the generalized symmetric groups \mathbb{Z}_r \wr S_n. We give an explicit formula to compute the determinant of an irreducible representation of \mathbb{Z}_r \wr S_n. Recently, several authors have characterized and counted the number of irreducible representations of a given finite group with nontrivial determinant. Motivated by these results, for given integer n, r an odd prime and \zeta a nontrivial multiplicative character of \mathbb{Z}_r \wr S_n with n<r, we obtain an explicit formula to compute N_{\zeta}(n), the number of irreducible representations of \mathbb{Z}_r \wr S_n whose determinant is \zeta.
