We study an explicit description of semibricks and 2-term simple-minded collections over preprojective algebras of type A via arc diagrams. We provide a bijection between the set of noncrossoing arc diagrams (resp. the set of double arc diagrams), which is in bijective correspondence with elements of the symmetric group, and the set of semibricks (resp. the set of 2-term simple-minded collections) over the algebra. Moreover we define a mutation and a partial order on the set of double arc diagrams. In particular, we obtain a poset isomorphism between the symmetric group and the set of 2-term simple-minded collections. As an application of our results, we study semibricks of some quotient algebras of the preprojective algebras of type A and we reprove some important results shown by the other authors.
