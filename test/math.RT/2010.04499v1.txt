Sp\"ath showed that the Alperin--McKay conjecture in the representation theory of finite groups holds if the so-called inductive Alperin-McKay condition holds for all finite simple groups. In a previous article, we showed that the Bonnaf\'e-Rouquier equivalence for blocks of finite groups of Lie type can be lifted to include automorphisms of groups of Lie type. We use our results to reduce the verification of the inductive condition for groups of Lie type to quasi-isolated blocks.
