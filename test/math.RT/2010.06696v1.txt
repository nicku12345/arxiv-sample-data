One of our goals is to represent exceptional Lie algebras of type F4, E6 , E7, and E8 as a matrix in complex numbers. The second goal is to give roots and their corresponding root vectors. The present paper is the first of a series of two papers, which is to give a representation as a 248x248 dimensional matrix in complex numbers by constructing an adjoint representation of E8. This representation also includes representations of F4, E6, E7, and G2.
