For classical Lie superalgebras of type I, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a Verma supermodule \Delta(\lambda) to be such that every non-zero homomorphism from another Verma supermodule to \Delta(\lambda) is injective. This is applied to describe the socle of the cokernel of an inclusion of Verma supermodules over the periplectic Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{pe}(n) and, furthermore, to reduce the problem of description of \mathrm{Ext}^1_{\mathcal O}(L(\mu),\Delta(\lambda)) for \mathfrak{pe}(n) to the similar problem for the Lie algebra \mathfrak{gl}(n).   Additionally, we study the projective and injective dimensions of structural supermodules in parabolic category \mathcal O^{\mathfrak p} for classical Lie superalgebras. In particular, we completely determine these dimensions for structural supermodules over the periplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{pe}(n) and the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}(2|2n).
