Let G_n denote either the group Sp(2n, F) or SO(2n+1, F) over a non-archimedean local field F. We determine the composition series of representations of G_n induced from the ladder and cuspidal representations such that the minimal exponent in the cuspidal support of the ladder representation is greater or equal \frac{1}{2}.
