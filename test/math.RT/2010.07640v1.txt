Let \Gamma be an embeddable non-degenerate polar space of finite rank n \geq 2. Assuming that \Gamma admits the universal embedding (which is true for all embeddable polar spaces except grids of order at least 5 and certain generalized quadrangles defined over quaternion division rings), let \varepsilon:\Gamma\to\mathrm{PG}(V) be the universal embedding of \Gamma. Let \cal S be a subspace of \Gamma and suppose that \cal S, regarded as a polar space, has non-degenerate rank at least 2. We shall prove that \cal S is the \varepsilon-preimage of a projective subspace of \mathrm{PG}(V).
