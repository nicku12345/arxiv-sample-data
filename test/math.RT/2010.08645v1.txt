Let {\Lambda} be a finite-dimensional associative algebra over a field. A semibrick pair is a collection of bricks in mod-{\Lambda} for which certain Hom- and Ext-sets vanish. We say Lambda has the pairwise 2-simple minded completability property if every set of bricks which is not contained in a 2-term simple minded collection has a subset of size 2 which is likewise not contained in a 2-term simple minded collection. We prove that a preprojective algebra of Dynkin type has this property if and only if it is of type A_1, A_2, or A_3. We then reduce the 2-simple minded completability property to a condition on semibrick pairs of size 3 and prove that all {\tau}-tilting finite algebras with 3 simple modules have this property. We conclude by giving a combinatorial proof that for preprojective algebras of type A, any semibrick pair of "maximal size" is a 2-term simple minded collection.
