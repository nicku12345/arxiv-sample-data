In this thesis we classify modules over a Witt-type Lie algebra and superalgebra such that when considered as modules of \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h}) they are free of rank 1. We provide sufficient conditions for simplicity, and compute the action of an automorphism on the module. Lastly, we apply the weighting functor and show that the resulting modules are intermediate series modules.
