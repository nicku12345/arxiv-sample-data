Let  \chi  be a virtual (generalized) character of a finite group  G  and  L=L(\chi) be the image of  \chi  on  G-\lbrace 1 \rbrace . The pair  (G, \chi)  is said to be sharp of type  L  if |G|=\prod _{ l \in L} (\chi(1) - l) . If the principal character of G is not an irreducible constituent of \chi, the pair (G,\chi) is called normalized. In this paper, we first provide some counterexamples to a conjecture that was proposed by Cameron and Kiyota in 1988. This conjecture states that if (G,\chi) is sharp and |L|\geq 2, then the inner product (\chi,\chi)_G is uniquely determined by  L . We then prove that this conjecture is true in the case that (G,\chi)  is normalized, \chi is a character of  G , and  L  contains at least an irrational value.
