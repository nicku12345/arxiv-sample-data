In this paper, we develop the theory of abstract crystals for quantum Borcherds-Bozec algebras.   Our construction is different from the one given by Bozec. We further prove the crystal embedding theorem and provide a characterization of {B}(\infty) and {B}(\lambda) as its application, where {B}(\infty) and {B}(\lambda) are the crystals of the negative half part of the quantum Borcherds-Bozec algebra U_q(\mathfrak g) and its irreducible highest weight module V(\lambda), respectively.
