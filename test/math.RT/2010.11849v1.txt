A Lie algebra is said to be generalised reductive if it is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra and a commutative radical. In this paper we extend the BGG category \mathcal{O} over complex semisimple Lie algebras to the category \mathcal {O'} over complex generalised reductive Lie algebras. Then we make a preliminary research on the highest weight modules and the projective modules in this new category \mathcal {O'}, and generalize some conclusions in the classical case. As a critical difference from the complex semisimple Lie algebra case, we prove that there is no projective module in \mathcal {O'}.
