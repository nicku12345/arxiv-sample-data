Let G be a connected reductive group defined over a non-archimedean local field F. Let B be a minimal F-parabolic subgroup with Levi factor T and unipotent radical U. Let \psi be a non-degenerate character of U(F) and \lambda a character of T(F). Let (K,\rho) be a Bushnell-Kutzko type associated to the Bernstein block of G(F) determined by the pair (T,\lambda). We study the \rho-isotypical component (c\text{-ind}_{U(F)}^{G(F)}\psi)^{\rho} of the induced space c\text{-ind}_{U(F)}^{G(F)}\psi of functions compactly supported mod U(F). We show that (c\text{-ind}_{U(F)}^{G(F)}\psi)^{\rho} is cyclic module for the Hecke algebra \mathcal{H}(G,\rho) associated to the pair (K,\rho). When T is split, we describe it more explicitly in terms of \mathcal{H}(G,\rho). We make assumptions on the residue characteristic of F and later also on the characteristic of F and the center of G depending on the pair (T,\lambda). Our results generalize the main result of Chan and Savin in \cite{CS18} who treated the case of \lambda=1 for T split.
