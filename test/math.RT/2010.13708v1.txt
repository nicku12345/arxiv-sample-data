Applying geometric methods of 2-dimensional cell complex theory, we construct a Galois covering of a bimodule problem satisfying some structure, triangularity and finiteness conditions in order to describe the objects of finite representation type. Each admitted bimodule problem \mathcal A is endowed with a quasi multiplicative basis. The main result shows that for a problem from the considered class having some finiteness restrictions and the schurian universal covering \tilde{\mathcal A}, either \mathcal A is schurian, or its basic bigraph contains a dotted loop, or it has a standard minimal non-schurian bimodule subproblem.
