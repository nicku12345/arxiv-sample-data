We study automorphic Lie algebras using a family of evaluation maps parametrised by the representations of the associative algebra of functions. This provides a descending chain of ideals for the automorphic Lie algebra which is used to prove that it is of wild representation type. We show that the associated quotients of the automorphic Lie algebra are isomorphic to twisted truncated polynomial current algebras. When a simple Lie algebra is used in the construction, this allows us to describe the local Lie structure of the automorphic Lie algebra in terms of affine Kac-Moody algebras.
