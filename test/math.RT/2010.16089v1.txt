In analogy with the Barbasch-Vogan duality for reductive linear groups, we introduce a duality map from the set of nilpotent orbits in \mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}) to the set of nilpotent orbits in \mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}), whose range consists of the so-called metaplectic special nilpotent orbits. We relate this new duality notion with the theory of primitive ideals and extend the notion of special unipotent representations to the real metaplectic groups.
