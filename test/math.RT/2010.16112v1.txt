In [AGRS] a multiplicity one theorem is proven for general linear groups, orthogonal groups and unitary groups (GL, O, and U) over p-adic local fields. That is to say that when we have a pair of such groups G_n\subseteq G_{n+1}, any restriction of an irreducible smooth representation of G_{n+1} to G_n is multiplicity free. This property is already known for GL over a local field of positive characteristic, and in this paper we also give a proof for O,U over local fields of positive odd characteristic.   By the Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion, this theorem reduces to the statement that any G_n-invariant distribution on G_{n+1} is also invariant to transposition. This statement for GL, O, and U over over p-adic local fields is proven in [AGRS]. An adaptation of the proof for GL that works over of local fields of positive odd characteristic is given in [Mez]. In this paper we make this adaptation also for the orthogonal and unitary groups. Our methods are a synergy of the methods of [AGRS] and of [Mez].
