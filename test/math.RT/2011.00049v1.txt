In 2014, Reeder and Yu constructed epipelagic representations of a reductive p-adic group G from stable functions on shallowest Moy-Prasad quotients. In this paper, we extend these methods when G is split. In particular, we classify all complex-valued characters vanshing on a slightly deeper Moy-Prasad subgroup and show that, while sufficient, a naive extension of Reeder-Yu's stability condition is not necessary for constructing supercuspidal representations.
