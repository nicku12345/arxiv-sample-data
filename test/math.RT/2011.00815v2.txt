We study the modular representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups. One of the most natural ways to label the irreducible representations of a given group or algebra in the modular case is to show the unitriangularity of the decomposition matrices, that is, the existence of a unitriangular basic set. We study several ways to obtain such sets in the general case of a symmetric algebra. We apply our results to the symmetric groups and to their Hecke algebras and thus obtain new ways to label the simple modules for these objects. Finally, we show that these sets do not always exist in the case of the alternating groups by studying two explicit cases in characteristic 3.
