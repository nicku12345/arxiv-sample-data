Let F be a non-archimedean local field and G the F-points of a connected simply-connected reductive group over F. In this paper, we study the unipotent \ell-blocks of G. To that end, we introduce the notion of (d,1)-series for finite reductive groups. These series form a partition of the irreducible representations and are defined using Harish-Chandra theory and d-Harish-Chandra theory. The \ell-blocks are then constructed using these (d,1)-series, with d the order of q modulo \ell, and consistent systems of idempotents on the Bruhat-Tits building of G. We also describe the stable \ell-block decomposition of the depth zero category of an unramified classical group.
