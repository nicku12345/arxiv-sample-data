We investigate the representation theory of the Temperley-Lieb algebra, TL_n(\delta), defined over a field of positive characteristic. The principle question we seek to answer is the multiplicity of simple modules in cell modules for TL_n over arbitrary rings. This provides us with the decomposition numbers for this algebra, as well as the dimensions of all simple modules. We obtain these results from diagrammatic principles, without appealing to realisations of TL_n as endomorphism algebras of U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2) modules.
