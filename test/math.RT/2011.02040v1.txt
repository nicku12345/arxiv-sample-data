We apply the notion of hyperfinite families of modules to the wild path algebras of extended Kronecker quivers k\Theta(d). While the preprojective and postinjective component are hyperfinite, we show the existence of a family of non-hyperfinite modules in the regular component for some d. Making use of dimension expanders to achieve this, our construction is more explicit than previous results.
