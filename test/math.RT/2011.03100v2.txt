I present several applications of the Dirac inequality to the determination of isolated unitary representations and associated "spectral gaps" in the case of unramified principal series. The method works particularly well in order to attach irreducible unitary representations to the large nilpotent orbits (e.g., regular, subregular) in the Langlands dual complex Lie algebra.
