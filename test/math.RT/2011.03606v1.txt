Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>2. We compute the Weyl filtration multiplicities in indecomposable tilting modules and the decomposition numbers for the symplectic group over k in terms of cap-curl diagrams under the assumption that p is bigger than the greatest hook length in the largest partition involved. As a corollary we obtain the decomposition numbers for the Brauer algebra under the same assumptions. Our work combines ideas from work of Cox and De Visscher and work of Shalile with techniques from the representation theory of reductive groups.
