Let {\bf G} be a connected reductive group defined over \mathbb{F}_p and {\bf B} be a Borel subgroup of {\bf G} (not necessarily defined over \mathbb{F}_p). Let \Bbbk be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0. We show that for each (one dimensional) character \theta of {\bf B} (not necessarily rational), there is an unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible \Bbbk{\bf G}-module \mathbb{L}(\theta) containing \theta as a \Bbbk{\bf B}-submodule, and moreover, \mathbb{L}(\theta) is isomorphic to a parabolic induction from a finite dimensional irreducible \Bbbk{\bf L}-module, where {\bf L} is a Levi subgroup of {\bf G}. Thus, we classified and constructed all irreducible \Bbbk{\bf G}-module with {\bf B}-stable line. As a byproduct, we give a new proof of the result of Borel and Tits on the structure of finite dimensional irreducible \Bbbk{\bf G}-modules.
