We construct a functor from the Hecke category to a groupoid built from the underlying Coxeter group. This fixes a gap in an earlier work of the authors. This functor provides an abstract realisation the localization of the Hecke category at the field of fractions. Knowing explicit formulas for the localization is a key technical tool in software for computations with Soergel bimodules.
