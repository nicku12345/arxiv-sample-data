Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0. We compute the Weyl filtration multiplicities in indecomposable tilting modules and the decomposition numbers for the general linear group over k in terms of cap diagrams under the assumption that p is bigger than the greatest hook length in the partitions involved. Then we introduce and study the rational Schur functor from a category of GL_n-modules to the category of modules for the walled Brauer algebra. As a corollary we obtain the decomposition numbers for the walled Brauer algebra when p is bigger than the greatest hook length in the partitions involved. This is a sequel to an earlier paper on the symplectic group and the Brauer algebra.
