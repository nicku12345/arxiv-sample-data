Gei\ss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer [Invent. Math. 209 (2017)] has introduced a notion of generalized preprojective algebras associated with generalized Cartan matrices C and their symmetrizers D. They realize crystal structures on the set of maximal dimensional irreducible components of nilpotent varieties [Selecta Math. (N.S.) 24 (2018)]. For general finite types, we give stratifications of these components via partial orders of torsion classes in module categories of generalized preprojective algebras in terms of Weyl groups. In addition, we realize Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen polytopes from generic modules of these components, and give a identification as crystals between the set of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen polytopes and the set of maximal dimensional irreducible components except for type \mathsf{G}_2. This generalizes the works of Baumann-Kamnitzer [Represent. Theory 16 (2012)] and Baumann-Kamnitzer-Tingley [Publ. Math. Inst. Hautes \'Etudes Sci. 120 (2014)].
