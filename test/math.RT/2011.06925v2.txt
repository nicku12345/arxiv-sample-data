We define and describe basic properties of weighted Homogeneous spaces (WHS). A weighted Homogeneous variety can be defined by an assignment of positive integral weights on the nodes of a Dynkin diagram via an element in the highest Weyl chamber. We give a criteria when two WHS with possibly different weight systems are isomorphic. We also give an explanation of invariant Kahler differentials on WHS. We also study the coordinate ring of a WPS by cluster algebras associated to weighted quivers.
