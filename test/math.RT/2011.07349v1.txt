Let F be a non-archimedean locally compact field of residue characteristic p\neq2, let G=\mathrm{GL}_{n}(F) and let H be an orthogonal subgroup of G. For \pi a complex smooth supercuspidal representation of G, we give a full characterization for the distinguished space \mathrm{Hom}_{H}(\pi,1) being non-zero and we further study its dimension as a complex vector space, which generalizes a similar result of Hakim for tame supercuspidal representations. As a corollary, the embeddings of \pi in the space of smooth functions on the set of symmetric matrices in G, as a complex vector space, is non-zero and of dimension four, if and only if the central character of \pi evaluating at -1 is 1.
