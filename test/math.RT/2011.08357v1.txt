We define a natural basis for the algebra of \frak{gosp}(1|2n)-invariant differential operators on the affine superspace \mathbb{C}^{1|2n}. We prove that these operators lie in the image of the centre of the enveloping algebra of \frak{gosp}(1|2n). Using this result, we compute explicit formulas for the eigenvalues of these operators on irreducible summands of \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{C}^{1|2n}). This settles the Capelli eigenvalue problem for orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras in the cases that were not addressed in Sahi-Salmasian-Serganova. Our main technique relies on an explicit calculation of a certain determinant with polynomial entries.
