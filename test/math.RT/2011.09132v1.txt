Let G be an almost linear Nash group, namely, a Nash group that admits a Nash homomorphism with finite kernel to some \GL_k(\mathbb R). A smooth \Fre representation V with moderate growth of G is called homologically finite if the Schwartz homology \oH_{i}^{\CS}(G;V) is finite dimensional for every i\in\BZ. We show that the space of Schwartz sections \Gamma^{\varsigma}(X,\SE) of a tempered G-vector bundle (X,\SE) is homologically finite as a representation of G, under some mild assumptions.
