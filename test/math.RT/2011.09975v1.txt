With the aid of the exponentiation functor and Fourier transform we introduce a class of modules T(g,V,S) of \mathfrak{sl} (n+1) of mixed tensor type. By varying the polynomial g, the \mathfrak{gl}(n)-module V, and the set S, we obtain important classes of weight modules over the Cartan subalgebra \mathfrak h of \mathfrak{sl} (n+1), and modules that are free over \mathfrak h. Furthermore, these modules are obtained through explicit presentation of the elements of \mathfrak{sl} (n+1) in terms of differential operators and lead to new tensor coherent families of \mathfrak{sl} (n+1). An isomorphism theorem and simplicity criterion for T(g,V,S) is provided.
