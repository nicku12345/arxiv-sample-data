Let G be a p adic Lie group. In this work, we develop a dimension theory for coadmissible G equivariant D modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces and prove the inequality of Bernstein for the case of rigid analytic flag varieties. In this setting, we then introduce the notion of weakly holonomic G equivariant \mathcal{D} modules. Finally, we define the duality functor on the category of weakly holonomic modules and study some of its properties.
