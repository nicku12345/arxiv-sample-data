We exhibit an isomorphism between the \operatorname{Ext}-algebra \operatorname{Ext}_\Lambda^\ast(\Delta,\Delta) of standard modules over the dual extension algebra \Lambda of two directed algebras B and A and the dual extension algebra of the \operatorname{Ext}-algebra \operatorname{Ext}_B^\ast(\mathbb{L},\mathbb{L}) with A. There are natural A_\infty-structures on these \operatorname{Ext}-algebras, and we describe that on \operatorname{Ext}_\Lambda^\ast(\Delta,\Delta) completely in terms of that on \operatorname{Ext}_B^\ast(\mathbb{L},\mathbb{L}). Lastly, we compute these A_\infty-structures explicitly in the case where B=A=K\mathbb{A}_n /(\operatorname{rad}K\mathbb{A}_n)^\ell.
