We study the effect of the Howe correspondence on Harish-Chandra series for type I dual pairs over finite fields with odd characteristic. We define a bijection obtained from this correspondence, and enjoying the property of ``having minimal unipotent support''. Finally, we examine the interaction between the Howe correspondence and weak cuspidality.
