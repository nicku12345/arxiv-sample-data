Let \mathcal U be the 2-category associated with \mathfrak{sl}_2. We prove that a complex of 1-morphisms of \mathcal U is null-homotopic if and only if its image in every simple 2-representation is null-homotopic. Under mild boundedness assumptions, we prove that it actually suffices for the image in the simple 2-representations to be acyclic. We apply this result to the study of the Rickard complex \Theta categorifying the action of the simple reflection of \mathrm{SL}_2. We prove that \Theta is invertible in the homotopy category of \U, and that there is a homotopy equivalence \Theta E \simeq F\Theta[-1].
