We give an explicit description of the irreducible components of two-row Springer fibers for all classical types using cup diagrams. Cup diagrams can be used to label the irreducible components of two-row Springer fibers. Given a cup diagram, we explicitly write down all flags contained in the component associated to the cup diagram. This generalizes results by Stroppel--Webster and Fung to all classical types.
