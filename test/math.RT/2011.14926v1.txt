Fomin and Zelevinsky's definition of cluster algebras laid the foundation for cluster theory. The various categorifications and generalisations of the original definition led to Iyama and Yoshino's generalised cluster categories \mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^{fd} coming from positive-Calabi-Yau triples (\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^{fd},\mathcal{M}). Jin later defined simple minded collection quadruples (\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^{p},\mathbb{S},\mathcal{S}), where the special case \mathbb{S}=\Sigma^{-d} is the analogue of Iyama and Yang's triples: negative-Calabi-Yau triples.   In this paper, we further study the quotient categories \mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^p coming from simple minded collection quadruples. Our main result uses limits and colimits to describe Hom-spaces over \mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^p in relation to the easier to understand Hom-spaces over \mathcal{T}. Moreover, we apply our theorem to give a different proof of a result by Jin: if we have a negative-Calabi-Yau triple, then \mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^p is a negative cluster category.
