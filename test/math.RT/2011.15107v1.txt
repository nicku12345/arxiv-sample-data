The Auslander correspondence is a fundamental result in Auslander-Reiten theory. In this paper we introduce the category \operatorname{mod_{\mathsf{adm}}}(\mathcal{E}) of admissibly finitely presented functors and use it to give a version of Auslander correspondence for any exact category \mathcal{E}. An important ingredient in the proof is the localization theory of exact categories. We also investigate how properties of \mathcal{E} are reflected in \operatorname{mod_{\mathsf{adm}}}(\mathcal{E}), for example being (weakly) idempotent complete or having enough projectives or injectives. Furthermore, we describe \operatorname{mod_{\mathsf{adm}}}(\mathcal{E}) as a subcategory of \operatorname{mod}(\mathcal{E}) when \mathcal{E} is a resolving subcategory of an abelian category. This includes the category of Gorenstein projective modules and the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules as special cases. Finally, we use \operatorname{mod_{\mathsf{adm}}}(\mathcal{E}) to give a bijection between exact structures on an idempotent complete additive category \mathcal{C} and certain resolving subcategories of \operatorname{mod}(\mathcal{C}).
