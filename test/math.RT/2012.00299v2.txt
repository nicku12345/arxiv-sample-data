Let G=1+A be a finite pattern group over the finite field {\mathbb{F}}_q. We give a natural bijection between coadjoint orbits of G and its equivalent classes of irreducible representations. More precisely, given any T\in A^t, viewed as a representative of associated coadjoint orbit {\mathfrak{O}}_T of G, we can explicitly construct a subgroup H_T  of G, such that {\mathrm{Ind}}_{H_T}^G \psi_T is irreducible and {\mathrm{Ind}}_{H_T}^G \psi_T \cong {\mathrm{Ind}}_{H_{T'}}^G \psi_{T'} if and only if T and  T' are in the same coadjoint orbit. Here \psi_T(x)=\psi({\mathrm{tr}} Tx)\text{ for }x\in H_T, and \psi is a fixed nontrivial additive character of {\mathbb{F}}_q.
