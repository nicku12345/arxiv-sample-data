We classify blocks in the BGG category \mathcal O of modules of non-integral weights for the exceptional Lie superalgebra G(3). We compute the characters for tilting modules of non-integral weights in \mathcal O. Reduction methods are established to connect non-integral blocks of G(3) with blocks of the special linear Lie algebra \mathfrak{sl}(2), the exceptional Lie algebra G_2, the general linear Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{gl}(1|1), \mathfrak{gl}(2|1) and the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{osp}(3|2).
