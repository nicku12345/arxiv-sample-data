This is the second paper of a series of papers on a version of categories \mathcal{O} for root-reductive Lie algebras. Let \mathfrak{g} be a root-reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{K} of characteristic 0 with a splitting Borel subalgebra \mathfrak{b} containing a splitting maximal toral subalgebra \mathfrak{h}. For some pairs of blocks \overline{\mathcal{O}}[\lambda] and \overline{\mathcal{O}}[\mu], the subcategories whose objects have finite length are equivalence via functors obtained by the direct limits of translation functors. Tilting objects can also be defined in \overline{\mathcal{O}}. There are also universal tilting objects D(\lambda) in parallel to the finite-dimensional cases.
