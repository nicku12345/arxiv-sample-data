For a simple real Lie group G with Heisenberg parabolic subgroup P, we study the corresponding degenerate principal series representations. For a certain induction parameter the kernel of the conformally invariant system of second order differential operators constructed by Barchini, Kable and Zierau is a subrepresentation which turns out to be the minimal representation. To study this subrepresentation, we take the Heisenberg Fourier transform in the non-compact picture and show that it yields a new realization of the minimal representation on a space of L^2-functions. The Lie algebra action is given by differential operators of order \leq3 and we find explicit formulas for the lowest K-type.   These L^2-models were previously known for the groups \operatorname{SO}(n,n), E_{6(6)}, E_{7(7)} and E_{8(8)} by Kazhdan and Savin, for the group G_{2(2)} by Gelfand, for the group \widetilde{\operatorname{SL}}(3,\mathbb{R}) by Torasso, and for \widetilde{\operatorname{SO}}(4,3) by Sabourin. Our new approach provides a uniform and systematic treatment of these cases and also gives new L^2-models for E_{6(2)}, E_{7(-5)} and E_{8(-24)} for which the minimal representation is a continuation of the quaternionic discrete series, and for the groups \widetilde{\operatorname{SO}}(p,q) with either p\geq q=3 or p,q\geq4 and p+q even.
