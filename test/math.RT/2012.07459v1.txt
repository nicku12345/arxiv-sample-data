A celebrated result in representation theory is that of higher Auslander correspondence. Let \Lambda an Artin algebra and X a d-cluster-tilting module. Iyama has shown that the endomorphism ring \Gamma of X is a d-Auslander algebra, and moreover this gives a correspondence between d-cluster-tilting modules and d-Auslander algebras. We present a self-contained and concise proof using the homological theory of idempotent ideals of Auslander--Platzeck--Todorov.
