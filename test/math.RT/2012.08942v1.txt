The restriction of an irreducible unitary representation \pi of a real reductive group G to a reductive subgroup H decomposes into a direct integral of irreducible unitary representations \tau of H with multiplicities m(\pi,\tau)\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}. We show that on the smooth vectors of \pi, the direct integral is pointwise defined. This implies that m(\pi,\tau) is bounded above by the dimension of the space \operatorname{Hom}_H(\pi^\infty|_H,\tau^\infty) of intertwining operators between the smooth vectors, also called symmetry breaking operators, and in this way provides a precise relation between these two concepts of multiplicity. This statement might have been common knowledge, but we could not find a reference in the literature.
