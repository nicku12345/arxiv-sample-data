Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu by extracting the similarities between exact categories and triangulated categories. In this article, we introduce and study the notion of \xi-tilting object in an extriangulated category, where \xi is a proper class of \mathbb{E}-triangles. This extends results in \cite{YGH_2020}.
