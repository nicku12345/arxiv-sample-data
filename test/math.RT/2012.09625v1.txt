Let \mathbb S be a Clifford module for the complexified Clifford algebra C\ell(\mathbb R^n), \mathbb S' its dual, \rho and \rho' be the corresponding representations of the spin group Spin(\mathbb R^n). The group G=Spin(\mathbb R^{1,n+1}) is the (twofold covering) of the conformal group of \mathbb R^n. For \lambda, \mu\in \mathbb C, let \pi_{\rho, \lambda} (resp. \pi_{\rho',\mu}) be the spinorial representation of G on  \mathbb S-valued \lambda-densities (resp. \mathbb S'-valued \mu-densities) on \mathbb R^n. For 0\leq k\leq n and m\in \mathbb N, we construct a symmetry breaking differential operator B_{k;\lambda,\mu}^{(m)} from C^\infty(\mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R^n, \mathbb S\otimes \mathbb S') into C^\infty(\mathbb R^n, \Lambda^*_k(\mathbb R^n)) which intertwines the representations \pi_{\rho, \lambda}\otimes \pi_{\rho',\mu}  and \pi_{\tau^*_k,\lambda+\mu+2m}, where \tau^*_k is the representation of Spin(\mathbb R^n) on \Lambda^*_k(\mathbb R^n).
