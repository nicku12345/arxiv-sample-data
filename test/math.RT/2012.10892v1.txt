Let G be a finite group, and F a field of characteristic 0 or prime to the order of G. In 1956, Berman proved that the number of inequivalent irreducible F-representations of G is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes of the elements of G, where "F-conjugacy" was defined in a certain way. In this paper, we define F-conjugacy on G in a more natural way and give a proof of the Berman's theorem. In addition, we give a formula for computing a primitive central idempotent (pci) of the group algebra F[G] corresponding to an irreducible F-representation of G, which can be obtained from the "F-character table" of G.   Let G contain a normal subgroup H of index p, a prime. In 1955, in case F is algebraically closed, Berman computed the pci of F[G] corresponding to an irreducible F-representation of G, in terms of pci's of F[H]. In this paper, we give a complete proof of this theorem of Berman, and extend this result when F is not necessarily algebraically closed (Theorem 5.1.1). Also, we work out decomposition of induced representation of an irreducible F-representation of H, into irreducible components (Theorem 6.1.1).
