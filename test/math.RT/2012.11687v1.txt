Let \Lambda be a basic finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field \mathbf{k}, and let \widehat{\Lambda} be the repetitive algebra of \Lambda. In this article, we prove that if \widehat{V} is a left \widehat{\Lambda}-module with finite dimension over \mathbf{k}, then \widehat{V} has a well-defined versal deformation ring R(\widehat{\Lambda},\widehat{V}), which is a local complete Noetherian commutative \mathbf{k}-algebra whose residue field is also isomorphic to \mathbf{k}. We also prove that R(\widehat{\Lambda},\widehat{V}) is universal provided that \underline{\mathrm{End}}_{\widehat{\Lambda}}(\widehat{V})=\mathbf{k} and that in this situation, R(\widehat{\Lambda},\widehat{V}) is stable after taking syzygies. We apply the obtained results to finite dimensional modules over the repetitive algebra of the 2-Kronecker algebra, which provides an alternative approach to the deformation theory of objects in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves over \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbf{k}}
