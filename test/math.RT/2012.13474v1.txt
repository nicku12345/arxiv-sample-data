Let G be a simple non-compact linear Lie group. Let \pi be any irreducible unitary representation of G with infinitesimal character \Lambda whose continuous part is \nu. The beautiful Helgason-Jonson bound in 1969 says that the norm of \nu is upper bounded by the norm of \rho(G), which stands for the half sum of the positive roots of G. The current paper aims to give a framework to sharpen the Helgason-Johnson bound when \pi is infinite-dimensional. We have explicit results for exceptional Lie groups. Ingredients of the proof include Parathasarathy's Dirac operator inequality, Vogan pencil, and the unitarily small convex hull introduced by Salamanca-Riba and Vogan.
