We show that, up to Morita equivalence, any finite-dimensional algebra with a suitable homological system, admits an exact Borel subalgebra. This generalizes a theorem by Koenig, K\"ulshammer and Ovsienko, which holds for quasi-hereditary algebras. Our proof follows the same general scheme proposed by these authors, in a more general context: we associate a differential graded tensor algebra with relations, using the structure of A_{\infty}-algebra of a suitable Yoneda algebra, and use its category of modules to describe the category of filtered modules associated to the given homological system.
