The Clebsh-Gordan coefficients for the Lie algebra   \mathfrak{gl}_3 in the Gelfand-Tsetlin base are calculated. In contrast to previous papers the result is given as an explicit formula. To obtain the result a realization of a representation in the space of functions on the group GL_3 is used. The keystone fact that allows to carry the calculation of Clebsh-Gordan coefficients is the theorem that says that functions corresponding to Gelfand-Tsetlin base vectors can be expressed through generalized hypergeometric functions.
