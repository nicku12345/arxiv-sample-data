Building on the embedding of an n-abelian category \mathscr{M} into an abelian category \mathcal{A} as an n-cluster-tilting subcategory of \mathcal{A}, in this paper we relate the n-torsion classes of \mathscr{M} with the torsion classes of \mathcal{A}. Indeed, we show that every n-torsion class in \mathscr{M} is given by the intersection of a torsion class in \mathcal{A} with \mathscr{M}. Moreover, we show that every chain of n-torsion classes in the n-abelian category \mathscr{M} induces a Harder-Narasimhan filtration for every object of \mathscr{M}. We use the relation between \mathscr{M} and \mathcal{A} to show that every Harder-Narasimhan filtration induced by a chain of n-torsion classes in \mathscr{M} can be induced by a chain of torsion classes in \mathcal{A}. Furthermore, we show that n-torsion classes are preserved by Galois covering functors, thus we provide a way to systematically construct new (chains of) n-torsion classes.
