If A is a finite-dimensional symmetric algebra, then it is well-known that the only silting complexes in \mathrm{K^b}(\mathrm{proj}A) are the tilting complexes. In this note we investigate to what extent the same can be said for weakly symmetric algebras. On one hand, we show that this holds for all tilting-discrete weakly symmetric algebras. In particular, a tilting-discrete weakly symmetric algebra is also silting-discrete. On the other hand, we also construct an example of a weakly symmetric algebra with silting complexes that are not tilting.
