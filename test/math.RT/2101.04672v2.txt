Orthogonality relations for Foulkes characters of full monomial groups are presented, along with three solutions to the problem of decomposing products of these characters, and new applications, including a product reformulation of a Markov chain for adding random numbers studied by Diaconis and Fulman, and a new proof of a theorem of Zagier which generalizes one of Harer and Zagier on the enumeration of Riemann surfaces of a given genus.
