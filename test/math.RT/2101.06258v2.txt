We introduce a method that produces a bijection between the posets {\rm silt-}{A} and {\rm silt-}{B} formed by the isomorphism classes of basic silting complexes over finite-dimensional k-algebras A and B, by lifting A and B to two k[[X]]-orders which are isomorphic as rings. We apply this to a class of algebras generalising Brauer graph and weighted surface algebras, showing that their silting posets are multiplicity-independent in most cases. Under stronger hypotheses we also prove the existence of large multiplicity-independent subgroups in their derived Picard groups as well as multiplicity-invariance of \rm TrPicent. As an application to the modular representation theory of finite groups we show that if B and C are blocks with |{\rm IBr}(B)|=|{\rm IBr}(C)| whose defect groups are either both cyclic, both dihedral or both quaternion, then the posets {\rm tilt-}{B} and {\rm tilt-}{C} are isomorphic (except, possibly, in the quaternion case with |{\rm IBr}(B)|=2) and {\rm TrPicent}(B)\cong{\rm TrPicent}(C) (except, possibly, in the quaternion and dihedral cases with |{\rm IBr}(B)|=2).
