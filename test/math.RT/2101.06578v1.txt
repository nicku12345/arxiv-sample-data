An algebraic group is called semi-reductive if it is a semi-direct product of a reductive subgroup and the unipotent radical. Such a semi-reductive algebraic group naturally arises and also plays a key role in the study of modular representations of non-classical finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras in positive characteristic, and some other cases. Let G ba a connected semi-reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{F} and \mathfrak{g}=Lie(G). It turns out that G has many same properties as reductive groups, such as the Bruhat decomposition. In this note, we obtain an analogue of classical Chevalley restriction theorem for \mathfrak{g}, which says that the G-invariant ring \mathbb{F}[\mathfrak{g}]^G is a polynomial ring if \mathfrak{g} satisfies a certain "posivity" condition suited for lots of cases we are interested in. As applications, we further investigate the nilpotent cones and resolutions of singularities for semi-reductive Lie algebras.
