Let G be a finite group and H a normal subgroup of prime index p. Let V be an irreducible {\mathbb F}H-module and U a quotient of the induced {\mathbb F}G-module V\kern-3pt\uparrow. We describe the structure of U, which is semisimple when {\rm char}({\mathbb F})\ne p and uniserial if {\rm char}({\mathbb F})=p. Furthermore, we describe the division rings arising as endomorphism algebras of the simple components of U. We use techniques from noncommutative ring theory to study {\rm End}_{{\mathbb F}G}(V\kern-3pt\uparrow) and relate the right ideal structure of {\rm End}_{{\mathbb F}G}(V\kern-3pt\uparrow) to the submodule structure of V\kern-3pt\uparrow.
