Let \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_{\bar{0}}+\mathfrak{g}_{\bar{1}} be a basic Lie superalgebra, \mathcal{W}_0 (resp.\mathcal{W}) be the finite W-(resp.super-) algebras constructed from a fixed nilpotent element in \mathfrak{g}_{\bar{0}}. Based on a relation between finite W-algebra \mathcal{W}_0 and W-superalgebra \mathcal{W} found recently by the author and Shu, we study the finite dimensional representations of finite W-superalgebras in this paper. We first formulate and prove a version of Premet's conjecture for the finite W-superalgebras from basic simple Lie superalgebras. As in the W-algebra case, the Premet's conjecture is very close to give a classification to the finite dimensional simple \mathcal{W}-modules. In the case of \ggg is Lie superalgebras of basic type \Rmnum{1}, we prove the set of simple \mathcal{W}-supermodules is bijective with that of simple \mathcal{W}_0-modules; presenting a triangular decomposition to the tensor product of \mathcal{W} with a Clifford algebra, we also give an algorithm to compute the character of the finite dimensional simple \mathcal{W}-supermodules with integral central character.
