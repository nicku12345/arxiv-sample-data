Let \sigma be an involution of a complex semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak g and \mathfrak g=\mathfrak g_0\oplus\mathfrak g_1 the related \mathbb Z_2-grading. We study relations between nilpotent G_0-orbits in \mathfrak g_0 and the respective G-orbits in \mathfrak g. If e\in\mathfrak g_0 is nilpotent and \{e,h,f\}\subset\mathfrak g_0 is an \mathfrak{sl}_2-triple, then the semisimple element h yields a \mathbb Z-grading of \mathfrak g. Our main tool is the combined \mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z_2-grading of \mathfrak g, which is called a mixed grading. We prove, in particular, that if e_\sigma is a regular nilpotent element of \mathfrak g_0, then the weighted Dynkin diagram of e_\sigma, \mathcal D(e_\sigma), has only isolated zeros. It is also shown that if G{\cdot}e_\sigma\cap\mathfrak g_1\ne\varnothing, then the Satake diagram of \sigma has only isolated black nodes and these black nodes occur among the zeros of \mathcal D(e_\sigma). Using mixed gradings related to e_\sigma, we define an inner involution \check\sigma such that \sigma and \check\sigma commute. Here we prove that the Satake diagrams for both \check\sigma and \sigma\check\sigma have isolated black nodes.
