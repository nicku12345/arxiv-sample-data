Our first result provides a new characterization of Auslander algebras using a property of hereditary torsion pairs. The second result shows an Auslander algebra \Lambda is left or right glued if and only if \Lambda is representation-finite. Finally, our third result shows the module category of any Auslander algebra contains a tilting module with a particular property, which we call the hereditary property. Applications of this property are investigated.
