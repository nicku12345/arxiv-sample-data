In a previous paper by the authors, we obtain the first example of a finitely freely generated simple \mathbb Z-graded Lie conformal algebra of linear growth that cannot be embedded into any general Lie conformal algebra. In this paper, we obtain, as a byproduct, another class of such Lie conformal algebras by classifying \mathbb Z-graded simple Lie conformal algebras {\cal G}=\oplus_{i=-1}^\infty{\cal G}_i satisfying the following, (1) {\cal G}_0\cong{\rm Vir}, the Virasoro conformal algebra; (2) Each {\cal G}_i for i\ge-1 is a {\rm Vir}-module of rank one. These algebras include some Lie conformal algebras of Block type.
