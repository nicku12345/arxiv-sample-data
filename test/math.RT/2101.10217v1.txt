Let G=SL(2,5) be the special linear group of 2 \times 2-matrices with coefficients in the field with 5 elements. We show that the principal block over a splitting field K of characteristic two of the group algebra KG has a 3-cluster tilting module. This gives the first example of a representation-infinite block of a group algebra having a cluster tilting module and answers a question by Erdmann and Holm.
