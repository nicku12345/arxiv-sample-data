Previously, the last two authors found large families of decomposable Specht modules labelled by bihooks, over the Iwahori--Hecke algebra of type B. In most cases we conjectured that these were the only decomposable Specht modules labelled by bihooks, proving it in some instances. Inspired by a recent semisimplicity result of Bowman, Bessenrodt and the third author, we look back at our decomposable Specht modules and show that they are often either semisimple, or very close to being so. We obtain their exact structure and composition factors in these cases. In the process, we determine the graded decomposition numbers for almost all of the decomposable Specht modules indexed by bihooks.
