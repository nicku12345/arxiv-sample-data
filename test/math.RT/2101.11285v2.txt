Given a Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{g}, Gorelik defined the anticentre \mathcal{A} of its enveloping algebra, which consists of certain elements that square to the center. We seek to generalize and enrich the anticentre to the context of supersymmetric pairs (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k}), or more generally supersymmetric spaces G/K. We define certain invariant distributions on G/K, which we call ghost distributions, and which in some sense are induced from invariant distributions on G_0/K_0. Ghost distributions, and in particular their Harish-Chandra polynomials, give information about branching from G to a symmetric subgroup K' which is related (and sometimes conjugate) to K. We discuss the case of G\times G/G for an arbitrary quasireductive supergroup G, where our results prove the existence of a polynomial which determines projectivity of irreducible G-modules. Finally, a generalization of Gorelik's ghost centre is defined called the full ghost centre, \mathcal{Z}_{full}. For type I basic Lie superalgebras \mathfrak{g} we fully describe \mathcal{Z}_{full}, and prove that if \mathfrak{g} contains an internal grading operator, \mathcal{Z}_{full} consists exactly of those elements in \mathcal{U}\mathfrak{g} acting by \mathbb{Z}-graded constants on every finite-dimensional irreducible representation.
