We generalize the notion of T-Koszul algebras and prove that an analogue of classical Koszul duality still holds. Our approach is motivated by and has applications for n-hereditary algebras. In particular, we characterize an important class of n-T-Koszul algebras of highest degree a in terms of (na-1)-representation infinite algebras. As a consequence, we see that an algebra is n-representation infinite if and only if its trivial extension is (n+1)-Koszul with respect to its degree 0 part. Furthermore, we show that when an n-representation infinite algebra is n-representation tame, then the bounded derived categories of graded modules over the trivial extension and over the associated (n+1)-preprojective algebra are equivalent. In the n-representation finite case, we introduce the notion of almost n-T-Koszul algebras and obtain similar results.
