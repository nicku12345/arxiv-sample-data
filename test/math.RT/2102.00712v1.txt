Let F be an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic p. The modular McKay graph of G:=SL_n(p) with respect to its standard FG-module W is the connected, directed graph whose vertices are the irreducible FG-modules and for which there is an edge from a vertex V_1 to V_2 if V_2 occurs as a composition factor of the tensor product V_1 \otimes W. We show that the diameter of this modular McKay graph is \frac{1}{2} (p-1)(n^2-n).
