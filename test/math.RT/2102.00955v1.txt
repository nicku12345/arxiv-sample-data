Any graded restricted simple Lie algebra of Cartan type contains a subalgebra isomorphic to the Witt algebra over a field of prime characteristic. As some analogue of study on branching rules for restricted non-classical Lie algebras, it is shown that each graded restricted simple Lie algebra of Cartan type can be decomposed into a direct sum of restricted baby Verma modules and simple modules as an adjoint module over the Witt algebra. In particular, the composition factors are precisely determined.
