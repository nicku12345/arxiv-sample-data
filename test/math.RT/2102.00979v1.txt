In this paper, we construct a class of non-weight modules over the affine-Virasoro algebra of type A_1 by taking tensor products of irreducibles defined in [Q. Chen, J. Han, Non-weight modules over the affine-Virasoro algebra of type A_1, J. Math. Phys. 60, 071707 (2019)] with irreducible highest weight modules. The irreducibility and the isomorphism classes of these modules are determined. Moreover, we show that these tensor product modules are different from the known non-weight modules. Finally, we realize some tensor product modules as induced modules from modules over certain subalgebras of the affine-Virasoro algebra of type A_1, and give sufficient and necessary conditions for these induced modules to be reducible.
