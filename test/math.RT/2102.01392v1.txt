Let B be an one-point extension of a finite dimensional k-algebra A by a simple A-module at a source point i. In this paper, we classify the \tau-tilting modules over B. Moreover, it is shown that there are equations   |\tilt B|=|\tilt A|+|\tilt A/\langle e_i\rangle|\quad \text{and}\quad |\stilt B|=2|\stilt A|+|\stilt A/\langle e_i\rangle|.   As a consequence, we can calculate the numbers of \tau-tilting modules and support \tau-tilting modules over linearly Dynkin type algebras whose square radical are zero.
