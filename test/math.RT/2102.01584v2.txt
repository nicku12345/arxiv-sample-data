The homological theory of Auslander-Platzeck-Todorov on idempotent ideals laid much of the groundwork for higher Auslander-Reiten theory, providing the key technical lemmas for both higher Auslander correspondence as well as the construction of higher Nakayama algebras, among other results. Given a finite-dimensional algebra A and idempotent e, we expand on a criterion of Jasso-K\"ulshammer in order to determine a correspondence between the 2-precluster-tilting subcategories of \mathrm{mod}(A) and \mathrm{mod}(A/\langle e\rangle). This is then applied in the context of generalising dimer algebras on surfaces with boundary idempotent.
