We show that each orbit of a Borel subgroup B_{n-1} of GL(n-1) (respectively SO(n-1)) on the flag variety of GL(n) (respectively of SO(n)) is a bundle over a B_{n-1}-orbit on a generalized flag variety of GL(n-1) (respectively SO(n-1)), with fiber isomorphic to an orbit of an analogous subgroup on a smaller flag variety. As a consequence, we develop an inductive procedure to classify B_{n-1}-orbits on the flag variety. Our method is essentially uniform in the two cases. As further consequences, in the sequel to this paper we give an explicit combinatorial classification of orbits and determine completely the closure relation between orbit closures. This further develops work of Hashimoto in the general linear group case.
