Following earlier work with Cris Negron on the cohomology of Drinfeld doubles D(\mathbb G_{(r)}), we develop a "geometric theory" of support varieties for "extended Drinfeld doubles" \tilde D(\mathbb G_{(r)}) of Frobenius kernels \mathbb G_{(r)} of smooth linear algebraic groups \mathbb G over a field k of characteristic p > 0. To a \tilde D(\mathbb G_{(r)})-module M we associate the space \Pi(\tilde D(\mathbb G_{(r)}))_M of equivalence classes of "pairs of \pi-points" and prove most of the desired properties of M \mapsto \Pi(\tilde D(\mathbb G_{(r)}))_M. Namely, this association satisfies the "tensor product property" and admits a natural continuous map \Psi_{\tilde D} to cohomological support theory. Moreover, for M finite dimensional and with suitable conditions on \mathbb G_{(r)}, this association provides a "projectivity test", \Psi_{\tilde D} is a homeomorphism, and identifies \Pi(\tilde D(\mathbb G_{(r)}))_M with the cohomological support variety of M for various classes of \tilde D(\mathbb G_{(r)})-modules M.
