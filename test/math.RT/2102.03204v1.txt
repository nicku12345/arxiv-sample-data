Let G be a real linear algebraic group and K be a maximal compact subgroup. Let \mathfrak{p} be a standard minimal parabolic subalgebra of the complexified Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} of G. In this paper we show that: for any moderate growth smooth Fr\'echet representation V of G, the map V_{K}\subset V induces isomorphisms H_{i}(\mathfrak{n},V_{K})\cong H_{i}(\mathfrak{n},V) (\forall i\geq 0). This is called Casselman's comparison theorem in the literature. As a consequence, we show that: for any k\geq 1, \mathfrak{n}^{k}V is a closed subspace of V and the inclusion V_{K}\rightarrow V induces an isomorphism V_{K}/\mathfrak{n}^{k}V_{K}=V/\mathfrak{n}^{k}V. This strengthens Casselman's automatic continuity theorem.
