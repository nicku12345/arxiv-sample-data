Let G be a non-compact connected semisimple real Lie group with finite center. Suppose L is a non-compact connected closed subgroup of G acting transitively on a symmetric space G/H such that L\cap H is compact. We study the action on L/L\cap H of a Dirac operator D_{G/H}(E) acting on sections of an E-twist of the spin bundle over G/H. As a byproduct, in the case of (G,H,L)=(SL(2,{\mathbb R})\times SL(2,{\mathbb R}),\Delta(SL(2,{\mathbb R})\times SL(2,{\mathbb R})),SL(2,{\mathbb R})\times SO(2)), we identify certain representations of L which lie in the kernel of D_{G/H}(E).
