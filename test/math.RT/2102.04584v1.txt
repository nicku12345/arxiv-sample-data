We give a new and intrinsic proof of the transitivity of the braid group action on the set of full exceptional sequences of coherent sheaves on a weighted projective line. We do not use here the corresponding result of Crawley-Boevey for modules over hereditary algebras. As an application we prove that the strongest global dimension of the category of coherent sheaves on a weighted projective line \XX does not depend on the parameters of \XX. Finally we prove that the determinant of the matrix obtained by taking the values of n \ZZ-linear functions defined on the Grothendieck group K_0(\XX) \simeq \ZZ^n  of the elements of a full exceptional sequence is an invariant, up to sign.
