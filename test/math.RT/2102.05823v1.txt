For a simple module P over the Weyl super algebra K_{m,n}^+ (resp. K_{m,n}) and a simple weight module M over the general linear Lie superalgebra \mathfrak{gl}(m,n), the tensor module P\otimes M is a module over the Witt superalgebra W_{m,n}^+ (resp. W_{m,n}). We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for P\otimes M to be simple, and determine all simple subquotient of P\otimes M when it is not simple. All the work leads to complete classification of some problems on the weight representation theory of W_{m,n}^+ and W_{m,n}.
