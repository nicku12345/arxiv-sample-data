Let F be a non-Archimedean locally compact field of residue characteristic p, let G be an inner form of GL(n,F) with n>0, and let l be a prime number different from p. We describe the block decomposition of the category of finite length smooth representations of G with coefficients in an algebraically closed field of characteristic l. Unlike the case of complex representations of an arbitrary p-adic reductive group and that of l-modular representations of GL(n,F), several non-isomorphic supercuspidal supports may correspond to the same block. We describe the (finitely many) supercuspidal supports corresponding to a given block. We also prove that a supercuspidal block is equivalent to the principal (that is, the one which contains the trivial character) block of the multiplicative group of a suitable division algebra, and we determine those irreducible representations having a nontrivial extension with a given supercuspidal representation of G.
