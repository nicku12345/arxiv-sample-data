We compute the decomposition numbers of the unipotent characters lying in the principal \ell-block of a finite group of Lie type B_{2n}(q) or C_{2n}(q) when q is an odd prime power and \ell is an odd prime number such that the order of q mod \ell is 2n. Along the way, we extend to these finite groups the results of \cite{DVV19} on the branching graph for Harish-Chandra induction and restriction.
