Groups of structure 2.O_8^+(2) have an irreducible representation of degree 8 which can be realized over \mathbb{Z} and any prime field \mathbb{F}_p. This representation extends to a group of structure 2.O_8^+(2).2. Any subgroup Z \leq \mathbb{F}_p^{\times} acts by scalar multiplication on this module over \mathbb{F}_p.   In this short note we determine for which primes p > 7 and which Z the central products Z \circ (2.O_8^+(2) and Z \circ (2.O_8^+(2).2) have a regular orbit on the 8-dimensional \mathbb{F}_p-module.   This work was triggered by an omission in the paper by K\"ohler and Pahlings with title 'Regular Orbits and the k(GV)-Problem', a paper which is used in various places in work on the k(GV)-problem.
