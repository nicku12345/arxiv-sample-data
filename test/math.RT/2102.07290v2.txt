The problem of classifying tuples of nilpotent matrices over a field under simultaneous conjugation is considered "hopeless". However, for a fixed matrix order over a finite field, the number of concerned orbits is always finite. This paper gives a formula to calculate the number of absolutely indecomposable orbits using the same methodology from Hua [3]; those orbits are non-splittable over field extensions. As a consequence, those numbers are always polynomials with rational coefficients. A "generalized Weyl-Kac Denominator Identity" is derived which links the functions counting nilpotent matrices commuting with minimal building blocks of the conjugacy classes of the General Linear Group and the coefficients of those polynomials. It is conjectured that the coefficients of those polynomials are always non-negative integers.
