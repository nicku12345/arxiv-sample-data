We prove that if A is a string algebra then there are not three irreducible morphisms between indecomposable A-modules such that its composition belongs to \Re^{6} \backslash \Re^{7}, whenever the compositions of two of them are not in \Re^{3}. Moreover, for any positive integer n \geq 3, we show that there are n irreducible morphisms such that their composition is in \Re^{n+4} \backslash \Re^{n+5}.
