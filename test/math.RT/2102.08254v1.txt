The theory of \tau-tilting was introduced by Adachi--Iyama--Reiten; one of the main results is a bijection between support \tau-tilting modules and torsion classes. We are able to generalise this result in the context of the higher Auslander--Reiten theory of Iyama. For a finite-dimensional algebra A with 2-cluster-tilting subcategory \mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathrm{mod}A, we are able to find a correspondence between support \tau_2-tilting A-modules and torsion pairs in \mathcal{C} satisfying an additional functorial finiteness condition.
