In this expository note, I present some of the key features of the lattice of torsion classes of a finite-dimensional algebra, focussing in particular on its complete semidistributivity and consequences thereof. This is intended to serve as an introduction to recent work by Barnard-Carroll-Zhu and Demonet-Iyama-Reading-Reiten-Thomas.
