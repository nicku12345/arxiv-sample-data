This paper presents the square integrable representations of generalized Weyl-Heisenberg group. We investigate the quasi regular representation of generalized Weyl-Heisenberg group. Moreover, we obtain a concrete from for admissible vector of this representation. Finally, we provide some examples to support our technical considerations.
