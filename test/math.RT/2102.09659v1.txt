Bijections between invariants associated to indecomposable projective modules over some suitable Brauer configuration algebras and invariants associated to solutions of the Kronecker problem and the four subspace problem are used to categorify integer sequences in the sense of Ringel and Fahr. Dimensions of the Brauer configuration algebras and their corresponding centers involved in the different processes are given as well.
