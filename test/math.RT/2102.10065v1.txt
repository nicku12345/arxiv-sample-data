Let \mathfrak g be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. The symmetric algebra \mathcal S(\mathfrak g) is equipped with the standard Lie-Poisson bracket. In this paper, we elaborate on a surprising observation that one naturally associates the second compatible Poisson bracket on \mathcal S(\mathfrak g) to any finite order automorphism \theta of \mathfrak g. We study related Poisson-commutative subalgebras \mathcal C of \mathcal S(\mathfrak g) and associated Lie algebra contractions of \mathfrak g. To obtain substantial results, we have to assume that \mathfrak g is semisimple. Then we can use Vinberg's theory of \theta-groups and the machinery of Invariant Theory.   If \mathfrak g=\mathfrak h\oplus\dots \oplus \mathfrak h (sum of k copies), where \mathfrak h is simple, and \theta is the cyclic permutation, then we prove that the corresponding Poisson-commutative subalgebra \mathcal C is polynomial and maximal. Furthermore, we quantise this \mathcal C using a Gaudin subalgebra in the enveloping algebra \mathcal U(\mathfrak g).
