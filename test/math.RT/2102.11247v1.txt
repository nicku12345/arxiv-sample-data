We introduce a class of equivalences, which we call generalized semi-infinite Hecke equivalences, between certain categories of representations of graded associative algebras which appear in the setting of semi-infinite cohomology for associative algebras and categories of representations of related algebras of Hecke type which we call semi-infinite Hecke algebras. As an application we obtain an equivalence between a category of representations of a non-twisted affine Lie algebra \widehat{\mathfrak g} of level -2h^\vee-k, where h^\vee is the dual Coxeter number of the underlying semisimple Lie algebra \mathfrak g and k\in \mathbb{C}, and the category of finitely generated representations of the W-algebra associated to \widehat{\mathfrak g} of level k. When k=-h^\vee this yields an equivalence between a category of representations of \widehat{\mathfrak g} of central charge -h^\vee and the category {\rm Coh}({\rm Op}_{^LG}(D^\times)) of coherent sheaves on the space {\rm Op}_{^LG}(D^\times) of ^LG-opers on the punctured disc D^\times, where ^LG is the Langlands dual group to the algebraic group of adjoint type with Lie algebra \mathfrak g. This can be regarded as a version of the local geometric Langlands correspondence. The above mentioned equivalences generalize to the case of affine Lie algebras the Skryabin equivalence between the categories of generalized Gelfand-Graev representations of \mathfrak g and the categories of representations of the corresponding finitely generated W-algebras, and Kostant's results on the classification of Whittaker modules over \mathfrak g.
