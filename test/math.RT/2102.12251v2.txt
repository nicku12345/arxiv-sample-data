We construct a class of non-weight modules over the twisted N=2 superconformal algebra \T. Let \mathfrak{h}=\C L_0\oplus\C G_0 be the Cartan subalgebra of \T, and let \mathfrak{t}=\C L_0 be the Cartan subalgebra of even part \T_{\bar 0}. These modules over \T when restricted to the \mathfrak{h} are free of rank 1 or when restricted to the \mathfrak{t} are free of rank 2. We provide the sufficient and necessary conditions for those modules being simple, as well as giving the sufficient and necessary conditions for two \T-modules being isomorphic. We also compute the action of an automorphism on them. Moreover, based on the weighting functor introduced in \cite{N2}, a class of intermediate series modules A_\sigma are obtained. As a byproduct, we give a sufficient condition for two \T-modules are not isomorphic.
