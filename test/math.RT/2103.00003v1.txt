For those deformations that satisfy a certain non-degeneracy condition, we describe the structure of some of the simple modules of the deformations of the subcharacter algebra of a finite group. For a cyclic group of a prime order, we prove that the deformations are semisimple except for the case when it is given by the inclusion of the natural numbers, which corresponds to the algebra generated by the fibred bisets over a field of characteristic zero. We also give a complete description of the semisimple deformations in this particular case.
