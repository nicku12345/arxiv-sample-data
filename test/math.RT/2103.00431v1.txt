Let \frak g be a reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0. In this paper, we study the representations of \frak g with a p-character \chi of standard Levi form associated with a given subset I of the simple root system \Pi of \frak g. Let U_\chi({\frak g}) be the reduced enveloping algebra of \frak g. A notion "quasi-simple module" (denoted by \mathcal L_\chi(\lambda)) is introduced. The properties of such a module turn out to be better than those of the corresponding simple module \widehat L_\chi(\lambda). It enables us to investigate the U_\chi({\frak g})-modules from a new point of view, and correspondingly gives rise new consequences. First, we show that the first self extension of \mathcal L_\chi(\lambda) is zero, and the projective dimension of \mathcal L_\chi(\lambda) is finite when \lambda is p-regular. These properties make it significant to rewrite the formula of Lusztig's Hope (Lusztig's conjecture on the irreducible characters in the category of U_\chi({\frak g})-modules) by replacing \widehat L_\chi(\lambda) by \mathcal L_\chi(\lambda). Second, with the aid of quasi-simple modules, we get a formula on the Loewy lengths of standard modules and proper standard modules over U_\chi({\frak g}). And by studying some examples, we formulate some conjectures on the Loewy lengths of indecomposable projective \frak g-modules, standard modules and proper standard modules.
