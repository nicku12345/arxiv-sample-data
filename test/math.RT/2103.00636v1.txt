This paper generalizes the results of Hua [5][6] to representations of quivers over finite fields which respect nilpotent relations under certain assumptions. A formula which counts isomorphism classes of absolutely indecomposable representations with a given dimension vector is given and a ``generalized Weyl-Kac Denominator Identity'' is established. In principle, if the numbers of representations are known, then the numbers of isomorphism classes of absolutely indecomposable representations are known.
