We show that, given an almost-source algebra A of a p-block of a finite group G, then the unit group of A contains a basis stabilized by the left and right multiplicative action of the defect group if and only if, in a sense to be made precise, certain relative multiplicities of local pointed groups are invariant with respect to the fusion system. We also show that, when G is p-solvable, those two equivalent conditions hold for some almost-source algebra of the given p-block. One motive lies in the fact that, by a theorem of Linckelmann, if the two equivalent conditions hold for A, then any stable basis for A is semicharacteristic for the fusion system.
