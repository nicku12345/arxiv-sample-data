The classical construction of the Weil representation, that is with complex coefficients, has been expected to be working for more general coefficient rings. This paper exhibits a minimal ring \mathcal{A}, being the integral closure of \mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{p}] in a cyclotomic field, and carries the construction of the Weil representation over \mathcal{A}-algebras. As a leitmotiv all along the work, most of the problems can actually be solved over the based ring \mathcal{A} and transferred for any \mathcal{A}-algebra by scalar extension. The most striking fact consists in these many Weil representations arising as the scalar extension of a single one with coefficients in \mathcal{A}. In this sense, the Weil module obtained is universal. Building upon this construction, we are speculating and making prognoses about an integral theta correspondence.
