We introduce a new class of symmetric algebras, which we call hybrid algebras. This class contains on one extreme Brauer graph algebras, and on the other extreme general weighted surface algebras. We show that hybrid algebras are precisely the blocks of idempotent algebras of weighted surface algebras. For hybrid algebras whose Gabriel quiver is 2-regular, we show that the tree class of an Auslander-Reiten component is Dynkin or Euclidean or one of the infinite tress A_{\infty}, A_{\infty}^{\infty}, or D_{\infty}.
