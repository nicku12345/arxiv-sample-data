It is nearly twenty years that there exist computer programs to reduce products of Lie algebra irreps. This is a contribution in the field that uses a modern computer language (``C'') in a highly structured and object-oriented way. This gives the benefits of high portability, efficiency, and makes it easier to include the functions in user programs. Characteristic of this set of routines is the {\it all-dynamic} approach for the use of memory, so that the package only uses the memory resources as needed.
