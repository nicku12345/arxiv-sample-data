In this paper we will study certain models of irreducible admissible representations of the split special orthogonal group SO(2n+1) over a nonarchimedean local field. If n=1, these models were considered by Waldspurger. If n=2, they were considered by Novodvorsky and Piatetski-Shapiro \cite{NP}, who called them {\it Bessel models}. They arise from a variety of Rankin-Selberg integrals nad the resultos of this paper will naturally have applications to the study of L-functions. They also arise in the study of the theta correspondence between SO(2n+1) and the double cover of Sp(2n), and they will therefore be of importance in generalizing the work of Waldspurger. As a global application we consider the Eisenstein series on SO(2n+1) formed with a cuspidal automorphic representation \pi on GL(n), and we show that its Bessel period (6.2) is essentially a product of L-series. This generalizes work of B\"ocherer and Mizumoto.
