These are Notes prepared for nine lectures given at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, MSRI, Berkeley during the period January--March 1995. It is a pleasant duty to record here my gratitude to MSRI, and its staff, for making possible this 1994--95 Special Year in Automorphic Forms, and for providing such a setting for work.   The purpose of these Notes is to describe the contents of Arthur's earlier, foundational papers on the trace formula. In keeping with the introductory nature of the lectures, we have sometimes illustrated the ideas of Arthur's general theory by applying them in detail to the case of GL(2); we have also included a few lectures on the ``simple trace formula'' (and its applications), and on Jacquet's relative trace formula.
