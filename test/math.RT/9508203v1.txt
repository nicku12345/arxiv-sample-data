We prove the finiteness of the cohomology of torsion-free lattices in a semisimple Lie group of real rank one with coefficients in the distribution vector globalization of Harish-Chandra modules. The cohomology is expressed in terms of automorphic and cusp forms. We also consider the Lie-algebra cohomology of these globalizations for the nilpotent part of the Iwasawa decomposition of the group.
