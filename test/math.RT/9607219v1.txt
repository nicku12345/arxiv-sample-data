Suppose L is a semisimple Levi subgroup of a connected Lie group~G, X is a Borel G-space with finite invariant measure, and \alpha \colon X \times G \to \GL_n(\real) is a Borel cocycle. Assume L has finite center, and that the real rank of every simple factor of~L is at least two. We show that if L is ergodic on~X, and the restriction of~\alpha to~X \times L is cohomologous to a homomorphism (modulo a compact group), then, after passing to a finite cover of~X, the cocycle \alpha itself is cohomologous to a homomorphism (modulo a compact group).
