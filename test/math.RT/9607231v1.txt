The purpose of this note is to give an insertion scheme proof of the formula, p_\mu = \sum_{\lambda\vdash k} \chi^\lambda(\mu)s_\lambda,\formula where p_\mu is the power sum symmetric function, s_\lambda is the Schur function and \chi^\lambda(\mu) is the irreducible character of the symmetric group S_k indexed by the partition \lambda and evaluated at a permutation of cycle type \mu=(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_\ell). The proof of this formula is by direct application of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth insertion scheme and a recent formula of Roichman.
