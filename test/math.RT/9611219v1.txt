Let \Ga be a connected, solvable linear algebraic group over a number field~K, let S be a finite set of places of~K that contains all the infinite places, and let \theints be the ring of S-integers of~K. We define a certain closed subgroup~\GOS of \Ga_S = \prod_{v \in S} \Ga_{K_v} that contains \Ga_{\theints}, and prove that \Ga_{\theints} is a superrigid lattice in~\GOS, by which we mean that finite-dimensional representations \alpha\colon \Ga_{\theints} \to \GL_n(\real) more-or-less extend to representations of~\GOS.   The subgroup~\GOS may be a proper subgroup of~\Ga_S for only two reasons. First, it is well known that \Ga_{\theints} is not a lattice in~\Ga_S if \Ga has nontrivial K-characters, so one passes to a certain subgroup \GS. Second, \Ga_{\theints} may fail to be Zariski dense in \GS in an appropriate sense; in this sense, the subgroup \GOS is the Zariski closure of~\Ga_{\theints} in~\GS.   Furthermore, we note that a superrigidity theorem for many non-solvable S-arithmetic groups can be proved by combining our main theorem with the Margulis Superrigidity Theorem.
