We completely describe presentations of Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix if they are simple Z-graded of polynomial growth. Such matrices can be neither integer nor symmetrizable. There are non-Serre relations encountered. In certain cases there are infinitely many relations. Our results are applicable to the Lie algebras with the same Cartan matrices as the Lie superalgebras considered.
