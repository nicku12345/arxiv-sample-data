A general method for computing irreducible representations of Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras was introduced earlier by the first author. The representations of the algebras of types A_n, B_n, D_n and G_2 were computed and it is the purpose of this paper to extend these computations to F_4. The main goal here is to compute irreducible representations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type F_4 by only using information in the character table of the Weyl group.
