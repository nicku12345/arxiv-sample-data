A symmetry extending the T^2-symmetry of the noncommutative torus T^2_q is studied in the category of quantum groups. This extended symmetry is given by the quantum double-torus defined as a compact matrix quantum group consisting of the disjoint union of T^2 and T^2_{q^2}. The bicross-product structure of the polynomial Hopf algebra of the quantum double-torus is computed. The Haar measure and the complete list of unitary irreducible representations of the quantum double-torus are determined explicitly.
