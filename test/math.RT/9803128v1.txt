This work develops a methodical approach to counting of walks on cartesian products, biproducts, symmetric and exterior powers and bipowers, Schur operations, coverings and semicoverings of weighted graphs. For weight and root lattices of semisimple Lie algebras, this approach allows us to compute various combinatorial and representation-theoretical constants, in particular, the number of plane symplectic wave graphs with given number of vertices.
