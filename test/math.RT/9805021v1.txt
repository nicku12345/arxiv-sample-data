The first part of these notes is devoted to an introduction to algebraic D-modules. Several basic notions are introduced. In the second part, D-modules with group action are treated. Several important examples in this situation are discussed in details. Particularly, the Harish-Chandra systems for group characters and the Gelfand generalized hypergeometric systems are our main topics.
