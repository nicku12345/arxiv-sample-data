In this paper we study the Hecke algebra associated with a complex reflection group W. We discuss some properties of the Galois group of the splitting field of this algebra, and study its action on the so-called fake degrees of W. The methods we use to study the Hecke algebra are based on the construction of representations of this algebra as monodromy of equations of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov type.
