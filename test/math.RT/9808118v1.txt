We derive several identities that feature irreducible characters of the general linear, the symplectic, the orthogonal, and the special orthogonal groups. All the identities feature characters that are indexed by shapes that are "nearly" rectangular, by which we mean that the shapes are rectangles except for one row or column that might be shorter than the others. As applications we prove new results in plane partitions and tableaux enumeration, including new refinements of the Bender-Knuth and MacMahon (ex-)conjectures.
