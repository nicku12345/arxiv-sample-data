The multidimensional quantization procedure, proposed by the first author and its modifications (reduction to radicals and lifting on U(1)-coverings) give us a almost universal theoretical tools to find irreducible representations of Lie groups. By using this method and the root theory, we realize in this paper the representations of the degenerate principal series of symplectic groups.
