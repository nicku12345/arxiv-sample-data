In this paper we investigate the representations of reductive groups over a finite field, introduced in 1987 by D.Kazhdan and G.Laumon. We show that generically these representations are irreducible and that their character is equal to the function obtained by traces of Frobenius morphism on the stalks of the corresponding Lusztig's character sheaf. This, together with the corresponding result by G.Lusztig, implies that generic Kazhdan-Laumon representations are isomorphic to the corresponding Deligne-Lusztig representations.   In the second half of the paper we give a direct geometric construction of this isomorphism, assuming that certain generalization of the Lefschetz-Verdier trace formula holds.
