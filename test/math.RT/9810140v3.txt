We study the projective geometry of homogeneous varieties X= G/P\subset P(V), where G is a complex simple Lie group, P is a maximal parabolic subgroup and V is the minimal G-module associated to P. Our study began with the observation that Freudenthal's magic chart could be derived from Zak's theorem on Severi varieties and standard geometric constructions. Our attempt to understand this observation led us to discover further connections between projective geometry and representation theory.   Among other things, we calculate the variety of tangent directions to lines on X through a point and determine unirulings of X. We show this variety is a Hermitian symmetric space if and only if P does not correspond to a short root. We describe the spaces corresponding to the exceptional short roots and their unirulings using the octonions. Further calculations, in the case X is a Hermitian symmetric space, give rise to a strict prolongation property and the appearance of secant varieties at the infinitesimal level. Our work complements and advances that of Freudenthal and Tits, who studied homogeneous varieties in an abstract/axiomatic setting.
