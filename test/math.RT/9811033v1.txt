In this paper, we begin a quantization program for nilpotent orbits of a real semisimple Lie group. These orbits and their covers generalize the symplectic vector space.   A complex structure polarizing the orbit and invariant under a maximal compact subgroup is provided by the Kronheimer-Vergne Kaehler structure. We outline a geometric program for quantizing the orbit with respect to this polarization.   We work out this program in detail for minimal nilpotent orbits in the non-Hermitian case. The Hilbert space of quantization consists of holomorphic half-forms on the orbit. We construct the reproducing kernel. The Lie algebra acts by explicit pseudo-differential operators on half-forms where the energy operator quantizing the Hamiltonian is inverted. The Lie algebra representation exponentiates to give a minimal unitary ladder representation. Jordan algebras play a key role in the geometry and the quantization.
