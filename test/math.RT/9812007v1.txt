These are the lecture notes of a series of lectures on Dunkl operators. We discuss the underlying algebraic structure of the degenerate double affine Hecke algebra, intertwiners and shift operators. We apply this to Macdonald theory. We also discuss the ``compact'' and ``noncompact'' spectral decomposition of these operators. In the attractive noncompact situation we classify the discrete eigenfunctions and compute their square norms.
