Infinitesimal conformal transformations of R^n are always polynomial and finitely generated when n>2. Here we prove that the Lie algebra of infinitesimal conformal polynomial transformations over R^n, n>1, is maximal in the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields. When n is greater than 2 and p,q are such that p+q=n, this implies the maximality of an embedding of so(p+1,q+1,R) into polynomial vector fields that was revisited in recent works about equivariant quantizations. It also refines a similar but weaker theorem by V. I. Ogievetsky.
