Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra with adjoint group G. Suppose that \sigma is an involutive automorphism of g. Then \sigma induces uniquely an involution of G also denoted by \sigma, let K=G^\sigma be a subgroup of \sigma-fixed points. Consider a direct decomposition g=k+p of g into eigenspaces for \sigma. Then p is a K-module. Denote by a\subset p any maximal abelian ad-diagonalizable subalgebra. Consider the ``baby Weyl group'' W=N_K(a)/Z_K(a). Let \psi: C[p]^K\to C[a]^W be a restriction map of algebras of invariants. Then the famous Chevalley restriction theorem states that \psi is an isomorphism. The aim of this paper is prove the following Theorem. The restriction map \psi: C[p\times p]^K\to C[a\times a]^W is surjective.
