The paper presents a classification theorem for the class of flat connections with triangular (0,1)-components on a topologically trivial complex vector bundle over a compact Kahler manifold. As a consequence we obtain several results on the structure of K\"{a}hler groups, i.e., the fundamental groups of compact Kahler manifolds.
