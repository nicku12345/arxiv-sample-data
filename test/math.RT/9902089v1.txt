Generalizations of Redfield's master theorem and superposition theorem are proved by using decomposition of the tensor product of several induced monomial representations of the symmetric group S_d into transitive constituents. As direct consequences, one obtains several graphical corollaries. Given graphs \Gamma_1,\hdots ,\Gamma_k, with d vertices, together with their automorphism groups W_1\leq S_d,\hdots, W_k\leq S_d, one can find the number of superpositions of \Gamma_1,\hdots ,\Gamma_k, whose automorphism groups satisfy one of the following conditions: (1) the groups consist of even permutations; (2) the groups are trivial, in case at least one of W_m's is cyclic; (3) the groups are of odd order, in case at least one of W_m's is dihedral and its order is not divisible by 4; (4) the groups are of order dividing a natural number r, in case at least one of W_m's has a normal solvable subgroup of order r, such that the corresponding factor-group is cyclic of order relatively prime to r; (5) the groups are q-groups (q is a prime), in case at least one of W_m's has a normal q-subgroup such that the corresponding factor-group is cyclic of order relatively prime to q.
