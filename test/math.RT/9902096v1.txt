We introduce procellular algebras, so called because they are inverse limits of finite dimensional cellular algebras as defined by Graham and Lehrer. A procellular algebra is defined as a certain completion of an infinite dimensional cellular algebra whose cell datum is of ``profinite type''. We show how these notions overcome some known obstructions to the theory of cellular algebras in infinite dimensions.
