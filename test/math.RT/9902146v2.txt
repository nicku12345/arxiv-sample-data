Take the matrix Lie superalgebra gl_{N|N} with the standard generators E_{ij} where i,j=-N,...,-1,1,...,N. Define an involutive automorphism of gl_{N|N} by sending E_{ij} to E_{-i,-j}. Then the corresponding twisted subalgebra g in the polynomial current Lie superalgebra gl_{N|N}[u], has a natural Lie co-superalgebra structure. Here we quantise the universal enveloping algebra U(g) as a co-Poisson Hopf superalgebra. For the quantised algebra we give a description of the centre, and construct the double in the sense of Drinfeld. We also construct a class of irreducible representations of the quantised algebra, by introducing an appropriate analogue of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra.
