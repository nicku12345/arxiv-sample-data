We establish a close link between the amenability of a unitary representation \pi of a group G (in the sense of Bekka) and the concentration property (in the sense of V. Milman) of the corresponding dynamical system (\s_\pi,G), where \s_\H is the unit sphere the Hilbert space of representation. We prove that \pi is amenable if and only if either \pi contains a finite-dimensional subrepresentation or the maximal uniform compactification of \s_\pi has a G-fixed point. Equivalently, the latter means that the G-space (\s_\pi,G) has the concentration property: every finite cover of the sphere \s_\pi contains a set A such that for every \e>0 the \e-neighbourhoods of the translations of A by finitely many elements of G always intersect. As a corollary, amenability of \pi is equivalent to the existence of a G-invariant mean on the uniformly continuous bounded functions on \s_\pi. As another corollary, a locally compact group G is amenable if and only if for every strongly continuous unitary representation of G in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space \mathcal H the system (\s_\H,G) has the property of concentration.
