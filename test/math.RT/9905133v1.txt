Let H be the discrete 3-dimensional Heisenberg group with the standard generators x, y, z. The element Delta of the group algebra for H of the form Delta= (x+x^{-1}+y+y^{-1})/4 is called the Laplace operator.   This operator can also be defined as transition operator for random walk on the group.   The spectrum of Delta in the regular representation of H is the interval [-1,1]. Let E(A), where A is a subset of [-1,1], be a family of spectral projectors for Delta and m(A)=(E(A)e, e) be the corresponding spectral measure. Here e is the characteristic function of the unit element of the group H. We estimate the value m([-1,-1+t] \cup [1-t,1]) when t tends to 0. More precisely we prove the inequality m([-1,-1+t] \cup [1-t,1]) > const t^{2+alpha} for any positive alpha.
