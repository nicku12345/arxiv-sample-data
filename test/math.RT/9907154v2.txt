We give a geometric realization of the symmetric algebra of the tensor space C^n \bigotimes C^m together with the action of the dual pair (gl_n, gl_m) in terms of lagrangian cycles in the cotangent bundles of certain varieties. We establish geometrically the equivalence between the (gl_n, gl_m) duality and Schur duality. We establish the connection between Springer's construction of (representations of) Weyl groups and Ginzburg's construction of (representations of) Lie algebras of type A.
