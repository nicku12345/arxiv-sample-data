We prove a formula expressing a general n by n Toeplitz determinant as a Fredholm determinant of an operator 1-K acting on l_2({n,n+1,...}), where the kernel K admits an integral representation in terms of the symbol of the original Toeplitz matrix.   The proof is based on the results of one of the authors, see math.RT/9907127, and a formula due to Gessel which expands any Toeplitz determinant into a series of Schur functions.   We also consider 3 examples where the kernel involves the Gauss hypergeometric function and its degenerations.
