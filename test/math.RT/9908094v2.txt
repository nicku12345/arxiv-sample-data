Let F be the flag variety of a complex semi-simple group G, let H be an algebraic subgroup of G acting on F with finitely many orbits, and let V be an H-orbit closure in F. Expanding the cohomology class of V in the basis of Schubert classes defines a union V_0 of Schubert varieties in F with positive multiplicities. If G is simply-laced, we show that these multiplicites are equal to the same power of 2. For arbitrary G, we show that V_0 is connected in codimension 1. If moreover all multiplicities are 1, we show that the singularities of V are rational, and we construct a flat degeneration of V to V_0. Thus, for any effective line bundle L on F, the restriction map from H^0(G/B,L) to H^0(V,L) is surjective, and H^i(V,L)=0 for i>0.
