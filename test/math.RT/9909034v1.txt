This paper completes a series devoted to explicit constructions of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the classical Lie algebras. Here the case of odd orthogonal Lie algebras (of type B) is considered (two previous papers dealt with C and D types). A weight basis for each representation of the Lie algebra o(2n+1) is constructed. The basis vectors are parametrized by Gelfand--Tsetlin-type patterns. Explicit formulas for the matrix elements of generators of o(2n+1) in this basis are given. The construction is based on the representation theory of the Yangians. A similar approach is applied to the A type case where the well-known formulas due to Gelfand and Tsetlin are reproduced.
