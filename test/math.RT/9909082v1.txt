We give a classification of the principal and distinguished nilpotent pairs in all classical Lie algebras. As a classification of the principal pairs in the exceptional simple Lie algebras was obtained earlier (see Appendix to Ginzburg's preprint math.AG/9903059), we thus have a complete classification of principal nilpotent pairs.
