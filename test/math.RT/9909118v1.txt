Using vertex operators, we construct explicitly Lusztig's \mathbb Z[q, q^{-1}]-lattice for the level one irreducible representations of quantum affine algebras of ADE type. We then realize the level one irreducible modules at roots of unity and show that the q-dimension is still given by the Weyl-Kac character formula. As a consequence we also answer the corresponding question of realizing the affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras of simply laced type at level one in finite characteristic.
