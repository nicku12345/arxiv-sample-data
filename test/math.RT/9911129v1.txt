The nonstandard q-deformation U'_q({\rm so}_n) of the universal enveloping algebra U({\rm so}_n) has irreducible finite dimensional representations which are a q-deformation of the well-known irreducible finite dimensional representations of U({\rm so}_n). But U'_q({\rm so}_n) also has irreducible finite dimensional representations which have no classical analogue. The aim of this paper is to give these representations which are called nonclassical type representations. They are given by explicit formulas for operators of the representations corresponding to the generators of U'_q({\rm so}_n).
