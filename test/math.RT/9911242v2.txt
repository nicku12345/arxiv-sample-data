In this paper we classify noetherian hereditary abelian categories satisfying Serre duality in the sense of Bondal and Kapranov. As a consequence we obtain a classification of saturated noetherian hereditary categories.   As a side result we show that when our hereditary categories have no nonzero projectives or injectives, then the Serre duality property is equivalent to the existence of almost split sequences.
