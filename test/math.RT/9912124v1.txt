We construct examples of nonnegative harmonic functions on certain graded graphs: the Young lattice and its generalizations. Such functions first emerged in harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group. Our method relies on multivariate interpolation polynomials associated with Schur's S and P functions and with Jack symmetric functions. As a by-product, we compute certain Selberg-type integrals.
