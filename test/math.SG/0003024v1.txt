We provide an explicit construction of quasi-invariant measures on polarized coadjoint orbits of a Lie group G. The use of specific (trivial) central extensions of G by the multiplicative group {R}^+ allows us to restore the strict invariance of the measures and, accordingly, the unitarity of the quantization of coadjoint orbits. As an example, the representations of SL(2,\Real) are recovered.
