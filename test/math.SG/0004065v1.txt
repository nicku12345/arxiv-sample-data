In this paper we introduce cohomology and homology theories for Nambu-Poisson manifolds. Also we study the relation between the existence of a duality for these theories and the vanishing of a particular Nambu-Poisson cohomology class, the modular class. The case of a regular Nambu-Poisson structure and some singular examples are discussed.
