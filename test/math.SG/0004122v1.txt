A theorem of Delzant states that any symplectic manifold (M,\om) of dimension 2n, equipped with an effective Hamiltonian action of the standard n-torus \T^n = \R^{n}/2\pi\Z^n, is a smooth projective toric variety completely determined (as a Hamiltonian \T^n-space) by the image of the moment map \phi:M\to\R^n, a convex polytope P=\phi(M)\subset\R^n. In this paper we show, using symplectic (action-angle) coordinates on P\times \T^n, how all \om-compatible toric complex structures on M can be effectively parametrized by smooth functions on P. We also discuss some topics suited for application of this symplectic coordinates approach to K\"ahler toric geometry, namely: explicit construction of extremal K\"ahler metrics, spectral properties of toric manifolds and combinatorics of polytopes.
