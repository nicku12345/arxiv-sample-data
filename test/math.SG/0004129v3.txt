Motivated by orbifold string theory, we introduce orbifold cohomology group for any almost complex orbifold and orbifold Dolbeault cohomology for any complex orbifold. Then, we show that our new cohomology group satisfies Poincare duality and has a natural ring structure. Some examples of orbifold cohomology ring are computed.
