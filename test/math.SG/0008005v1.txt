A theorem of Muhly-Renault-Williams states that if two locally compact groupoids with Haar system are Morita equivalent, then their associated convolution C*-algebras are strongly Morita equivalent.   We give a new proof of this theorem for Lie groupoids. Subsequently, we prove a counterpart of this theorem in Poisson geometry: If two Morita equivalent Lie groupoids are s-connected and s-simply connected, then their associated Poisson manifolds (viz. the dual bundles to their Lie algebroids) are Morita equivalent in the sense of P. Xu.
