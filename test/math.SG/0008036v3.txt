It is well known that a measured groupoid G defines a von Neumann algebra W*(G), and that a Lie groupoid G canonically defines both a C*-algebra C*(G) and a Poisson manifold A*(G). We show that the maps G -> W*(G), G -> C*(G) and G -> A*(G) are functorial with respect to suitable categories. In these categories Morita equivalence is isomorphism of objects, so that these maps preserve Morita equivalence.
