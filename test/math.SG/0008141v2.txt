Some aspects of the geometry and the dynamics of generalized Chaplygin systems are investigated. First, two different but complementary approaches to the construction of the reduced dynamics are reviewed: a symplectic approach and an approach based on the theory of affine connections. Both are mutually compared and further completed. Next, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the existence of an invariant measure for the reduced dynamics of generalized Chaplygin systems of mechanical type. A simple example is then constructed of a generalized Chaplygin system which does not verify this condition, thereby answering in the negative a question raised by Koiller.
