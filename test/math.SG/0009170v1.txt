Motivated by deformation quantization, we consider in this paper ^*-algebras \mathcal A over rings \ring C = \ring{R}(i), where \ring R is an ordered ring and i^2 = -1, and study the deformation theory of projective modules over these algebras carrying the additional structure of a (positive) \mathcal A-valued inner product. For A=C^\infty(M), M a manifold, these modules can be identified with Hermitian vector bundles E over M. We show that for a fixed Hermitian star-product on M, these modules can always be deformed in a unique way, up to (isometric) equivalence. We observe that there is a natural bijection between the sets of equivalence classes of local Hermitian deformations of C^\infty(M) and \Gamma^\infty(\End(E)) and that the corresponding deformed algebras are formally Morita equivalent, an algebraic generalization of strong Morita equivalence of C^*-algebras. We also discuss the semi-classical geometry arising from these deformations.
