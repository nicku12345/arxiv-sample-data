We introduce spin Calogero-Moser systems associated with root systems of simple Lie algebras and give the associated Lax representations (with spectral parameter) and fundamental Poisson bracket relations. Our analysis is based on a group-theoretic framework similar in spirit to the standard classical r-matrix theory for constant r-matrices.
