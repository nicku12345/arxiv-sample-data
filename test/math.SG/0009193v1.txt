We study the symplectic geometry of the moduli spaces M_r=M_r(\s^3) of closed n-gons with fixed side-lengths in the 3-sphere. We prove that these moduli spaces have symplectic structures obtained by reduction of the fusion product of n conjugacy classes in SU(2), denoted C_r^n, by the diagonal conjugation action of SU(2). Here C_r^n is a quasi-Hamiltonian SU(2)-space. An integrable Hamiltonian system is constructed on M_r in which the Hamiltonian flows are given by bending polygons along a maximal collection of nonintersecting diagonals. Finally, we show the symplectic structure on M_r relates to the symplectic structure obtained from gauge-theoretic description of M_r. The results of this paper are analogues for the 3-sphere of results obtained for M_r(\h^3), the moduli space of n-gons with fixed side-lengths in hyperbolic 3-space \cite{KMT}, and for M_r(\E^3), the moduli space of n-gons with fixed side-lengths in \E^3
