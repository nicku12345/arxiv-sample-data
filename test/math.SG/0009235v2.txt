We give geometric explanations and proofs of various mirror symmetry conjectures for T^{n}-invariant Calabi-Yau manifolds when instanton corrections are absent. This uses fiberwise Fourier transformation together with base Legendre transformation.   We discuss mirror transformations of   (i) moduli spaces of complex structures and complexified symplectic structures, H^{p,q}'s, Yukawa couplings;   (ii) sl(2)xsl(2)-actions;   (iii) holomorphic and symplectic automorphisms and   (iv) A- and B-connections, supersymmetric A- and B-cycles, correlation functions.   We also study (ii) for T^{n}-invariant hyperkahler manifolds.
