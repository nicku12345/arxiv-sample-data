Poisson superpair is a pair of Poisson superalgebra structures on a super commutative associative algebra, whose any linear combination is also a Poisson superalgebra structure. In this paper, we first construct certain linear and quadratic Poisson superpairs over a finite-dimensional or semi-finitely-filtered polarized \Bbb{Z}_2-graded associative algebra. Then we give a construction of certain Hamiltonian superpairs in the formal variational calculus over any finite-dimensional \Bbb{Z}_2-graded associative algebra with a supersymmetric nondegenerate associative bilinear form. Our constructions are based on the Adler mapping in a general sense. Our works in this paper can be viewed as noncommutative generalizations of the Adler-Gel'fand-Dikii Hamiltonian pair. As a preparatory work, some structural properties of polarized associative algebras have been studied.
