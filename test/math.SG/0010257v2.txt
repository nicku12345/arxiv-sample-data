We construct a unique G-equivariant graded star product on the algebra S(g)/I of polynomial functions on the minimal nilpotent coadjoint orbit \Omin of G where G is a complex simple Lie group and g\neq\sl_2(C). This strengthens the result of Arnal, Benamor, and Cahen.   Our main result is to compute, for G classical, the star product of a momentum function \mu_x with any function f. We find \mu_x\star f=\mu_xf+\half\{\mu_x,f\}t+\Lambda^x(f)t^2. For \g different from sp_n(\C), \Lambda^x is not a differential operator. Instead \Lamda^x is the left quotient of an explicit order 4 algebraic differential operator D^x by an order 2 invertible diagonalizable operator. Precisely, \Lambda^x=-{1/4}\frac{1}{E'(E'+1)}D^x where E' is a positive shift of the Euler vector field. Thus \mu_x\star f is not local in f.   Using \star we construct a positive definite hermitian inner product on Sg/I. The Hilbert space completion of Sg/I is then a unitary representation of G. This quantizes \Omin in the sense of geometric quantization and the orbit method.
