Let \XR be a (generalized) flag manifold of a non-compact real semisimple Lie group \GR, where \XR and \GR have complexifications X and G. We investigate the problem of constructing a graded star product on Pol(T^*\XR) which corresponds to a \GR-equivariant quantization of symbols into smooth differential operators acting on half-densities on \XR.   We show that any solution is algebraic in that it restricts to a G-equivariant graded star product star on the algebraic part R of Pol(T^*\XR). We construct, when R is generated by the momentum functions \mu^x for G, a preferred choice of star where \mu^x\star\phi has the form \mu^x\phi+\half\{\mu^x,\phi\}t+\Lambda^x(\phi)t^2. Here \Lambda^x are operators on R which are not differential in the known examples and so \mu^x\star\phi is not local in \phi.   R acquires an invariant positive definite inner product compatible with its grading. The completion of R is a new Fock space type model of the unitary representation of G on L^2 half-densities on X.
