We show that there is a consistent polynomial quantization of the coordinate ring of a basic nilpotent coadjoint orbit of a semisimple Lie group. We also show, at least in the case of a nilpotent orbit in sl(2,R)*, that any such quantization is essentially trivial. Furthermore, we prove that the coordinate ring of a basic semisimple orbit in sl(2,R)* cannot be consistently polynomially quantized.
