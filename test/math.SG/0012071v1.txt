Motivated by deformation quantization we investigate the algebraic GNS construction of *-representations of deformed *-algebras over ordered rings and compute their classical limit. The question if a GNS representation can be deformed leads to the deformation of positive linear functionals. Various physical examples from deformation quantization like the Bargmann-Fock and the Schr{\"o}dinger representation as well as KMS functionals are discussed.
