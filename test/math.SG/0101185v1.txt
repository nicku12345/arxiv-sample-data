We construct a new aperiodic symplectic plug and hence new smooth counterexamples to the Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture in R^{2n} for n>2. In other words, we develop an alternative procedure, to those of V. L. Ginzburg and M. Herman, for constructing smooth Hamiltonian flows, on the standard symplectic R^{2n} for n>2, which have compact regular level sets that contain no periodic orbits. The plug described here is a modification of those built by Ginzburg. In particular, we utilize a different "trap" which makes the necessary embeddings of this plug much easier to construct.
