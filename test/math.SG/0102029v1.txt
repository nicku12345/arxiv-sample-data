We prove gluing theorems for tight contact structures. In particular, we rederive (as special cases) gluing theorems due to Colin and Makar-Limanov, and present an algorithm for determining whether a given contact structure on a handlebody is tight. As applications, we construct a tight contact structure on a genus 4 handlebody which becomes overtwisted after Legendrian -1 surgery, and study certain Legendrian surgeries on T^3.
