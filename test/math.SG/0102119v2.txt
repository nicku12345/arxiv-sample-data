Let (F,J,\omega) be an almost K\"ahler manifold, \alpha a J-holomorphic action of a compact Lie group \hat K on F, and K a closed normal subgroup of \hat K which leaves \omega invariant. We introduce gauge theoretical invariants for such triples (F,\alpha,K). The invariants are associated with moduli spaces of solutions of a certain vortex type equation on a Riemann surface.   We give explicite descriptions of the moduli spaces associated with the triple (\Hom(\C^r,\C^{r_0}), \alpha_{\rm can},U(r)), where \alpha_{\rm can} denotes the canonical action of \hat K=U(r)\times U(r_0) on \Hom(\C^r,\C^{r_0}). In the abelian case r=1, the new invariants can be computed expliciteley and identified with the full Seiberg-Witten invariants of ruled surfaces.
