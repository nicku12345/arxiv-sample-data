In this note we prove that, for any integer n, there exist a smooth 4-manifold, homotopic to a K3 surface, defined by applying the link surgery method of Fintushel-Stern to a certain 2-component graph link, which admits n inequivalent symplectic structures Keywords: Symplectic topology of 4-manifolds; Seiberg-Witten theory
