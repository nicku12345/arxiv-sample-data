For a closed symplectic manifold (M,\omega), a compatible almost complex structure J, a 1-periodic time dependent symplectic vector field Z and a homotopy class of closed curves \gamma we define a Floer complex based on 1-periodic trajectories of Z in the homotopy class \gamma. We suppose that the closed 1-form i_{Z_t}\omega represents a cohomology class \beta(Z):=\beta, independent of t. We show how to associate to (M,\omega,\gamma,\beta) and to two pairs (Z_i,J_i), i=1,2 with \beta(Z_i)=\beta an invariant, the relative symplectic torsion, which is an element in the Whitehead group Wh(\Lambda_0), of a Novikov ring \Lambda_0 associated with (M,\omega,Z,\gamma). If the cohomology of the Floer complex vanishes or if \gamma is trivial we derive an invariant, the symplectic torsion for any pair (Z,J).   We prove, that when \beta(\gamma)\neq 0, or when \gamma is non-trivial and \beta is 'small', the cohomology of the Floer complex is trivial, but the symplectic torsion can be non-trivial. Using the first fact we conclude results about non-contractible 1-periodic trajectories of 1-periodic symplectic vector fields. In this version we will only prove the statements for closed weakly monotone manifolds, but note that they remain true as formulated for arbitrary closed symplectic manifolds.
