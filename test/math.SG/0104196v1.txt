Via considerations of symplectic reduction, monodromy, mirror symmetry and Chern-Simons functionals, a conjecture is proposed on the existence of special Lagrangians in the hamiltonian deformation class of a given Lagrangian submanifold of a Calabi-Yau manifold. It involves a stability condition for graded Lagrangians, and can be proved for the simple case of T^2.
