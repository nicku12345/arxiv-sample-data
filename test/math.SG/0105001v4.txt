In this paper we show how deformation quantization of line bundles over a Poisson manifold M produces a canonical action \Phi of the Picard group \Pic(M)\cong H^2(M,\mathbb Z) on the moduli space of equivalence classes of differential star products on M, \Def(M). The orbits of \Phi characterize Morita equivalent star products on M. We describe the semiclassical limit of \Phi in terms of the characteristic classes of star products by studying the semiclassical geometry of deformed line bundles.
