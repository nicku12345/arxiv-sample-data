We define \textit{graded manifolds} as a version of supermanifolds endowed with an additional \mathbb Z-grading in the structure sheaf, called \textit{weight} (not linked with parity). Examples are ordinary supermanifolds, vector bundles over supermanifolds, double vector bundles, iterated constructions like TTM, etc. I give a construction of \textit{doubles} for \textit{graded} QS- and \textit{graded QP-manifolds} (graded manifolds endowed with a homological vector field and a Schouten/Poisson bracket). Relation is explained with Drinfeld's Lie bialgebras and their doubles. Graded QS-manifolds can be considered, roughly, as ``generalized Lie bialgebroids''. The double for them is closely related with the analog of Drinfeld's double for Lie bialgebroids recently suggested by Roytenberg. Lie bialgebroids as a generalization of Lie bialgebras, over some base manifold, were defined by Mackenzie and P. Xu. Graded QP-manifolds give an {odd version} for all this, in particular, they contain ``odd analogs'' for Lie bialgebras, Manin triples, and Drinfeld's double.
