It is shown that an embedded Lagrangian Klein bottle represents a non-trivial mod 2 homology class in a compact symplectic four-manifold (X,\omega) with c_1(X)\cdot[\omega]>0. (In versions 1 and 2, the last assumption was missing. A counterexample to this general claim and the first proof of the corrected result have been found by Vsevolod Shevchishin.) As a corollary one obtains that the Klein bottle does not admit a Lagrangian embedding into the standard symplectic four-space.
