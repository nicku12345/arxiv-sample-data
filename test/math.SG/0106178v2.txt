In this paper we give a complete characterization of Morita equivalent star products on symplectic manifolds in terms of their characteristic classes: two star products \star and \star' on (M,\omega) are Morita equivalent if and only if there exists a symplectomorphism \psi:M\longrightarrow M such that the relative class t(\star,\psi^*(\star')) is 2 \pi \im-integral. For star products on cotangent bundles, we show that this integrality condition is related to Dirac's quantization condition for magnetic charges.
