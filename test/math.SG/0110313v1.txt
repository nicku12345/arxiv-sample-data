We study the symplectomorphism groups G_{\lambda}=Symp_0(M,\omega_{\lambda}) of an arbitrary closed manifold M equipped with a 1-parameter family of symplectic forms \omega_{\lambda} with variable cohomology class. We show that the existence of nontrivial elements in \pi_*({\cal A},{\cal A}'), where ({\cal A},{\cal A}') is a suitable pair of spaces of almost complex structures, implies the exiarxiv.org stence of families of nontrivial elements in \pi_{*-i}G_{\lambda}, for i=1 or 2. Suitable parametric Gromov Witten invariants detect nontrivial elements in \pi_*({\cal A},{\cal A}'). By looking at certain resolutions of quotient singularities we investigate the situation (M,\omega_{\lambda})= (S^2 \times S^2 \times X,\sigma_F \oplus \lambda \sigma_B \oplus \omega_{st}), with (X,\omega_{st}) an arbitrary symplectic manifold. We find families of nontrivial elements in \pi_k(G_{\lambda}^X), for countably many k and different values of \lambda. In particular we show that the fragile elements w_{\ell} found by Abreu-McDuff in \pi_{4 \ell}(G_{\ell+1}^{pt}) do not disappear when we consider them in S^2 \times S^2 \times X.
