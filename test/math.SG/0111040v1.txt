This paper presents generalized momentum mappings for covariant Hamiltonian field theories. The new momentum mappings arise from a generalization of symplectic geometry to L_VY, the bundle of vertically adapted linear frames over the bundle of field configurations Y. Specifically, the generalized field momentum observables are vector-valued momentum mappings on the vertically adapted frame bundle generated from automorphisms of Y. The generalized symplectic geometry on L_VY is a covering theory for multisymplectic geometry on the multiphase space Z, and it follows that the field momentum observables on Z are generalized by those on L_VY. Furthermore, momentum observables on L_VY produce conserved quantities along flows in L_VY. For translational and orthogonal symmetries of fields and reparametrization symmetry in mechanics, momentum is conserved, and for angular momentum in time-evolution mechanics we produce a version of the parallel axis theorem of rotational dynamics, and in special relativity, we produce the transformation of angular momentum under boosts.
