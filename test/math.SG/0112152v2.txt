We develop a theory of quasi-Lie bialgebroids using a homological approach. This notion is a generalization of quasi-Lie bialgebras, as well as twisted Poisson structures with a 3-form background which have recently appeared in the context of string theory, and were studied by \v{S}evera and Weinstein using a different method.
