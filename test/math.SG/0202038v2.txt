We study Poisson structures over singular varieties. In this purpose, we consider the Koszul complex associated to the equations of a complete intersection. This complex forms a differential graded algebra which is equivalent to the algebra of the variety. We show that a Poisson structure is equivalent to a sequence of multiderivations over the Koszul complex. If our variety has isolated singularities, then we can construct a sequence of multiderivations of reduced form.
