We present a definition of generating functions of canonical relations, which are real functions on symmetric symplectic spaces, discussing some conditions for the presence of caustics. We show how the actions compose by a neat geometrical formula and are connected to the hamiltonians via a geometrically simple variational principle which determines the classical trajectories, discussing the temporal evolution of such ``extended hamiltonians'' in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations. Simplest spaces are treated explicitly.
