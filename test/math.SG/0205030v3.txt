We introduce the Hofer-Zehnder G-semicapacity c_{HZ}^G(M,\om) of a symplectic manifold (M,\om) with respect to a subgroup G \subset \pi_1(M) (c_{HZ}(M,\om) \leq c^G_{HZ}(M,\om)) and prove that if (M,\om) is tame and there exists an open subset U \subset M admitting a Hamiltonian free circle action with order greater than two then U has bounded Hofer-Zehnder G-semicapacity, where G \subset \pi_1(M) is the subgroup generated by the orbits of the action, provided that the index of rationality of (M,\om) is sufficiently great (for instance, if [\om]|_{\pi_2(M)}=0).   We give a lot of applications of this result. Using P. Biran's decomposition theorem, we prove the following: let (M^{2n},\Om) be a closed K\"ahler manifold (n>2) with [\Om] \in H^2(M,\Z) and \Sigma a complex hypersurface representing the Poincar\'e dual of k[\Om], for some k \in \N. Suppose either that \Om vanishes on \pi_2(\Sigma) or that k>2. Then there exists a decomposition of M\setminus\Sigma into an open dense connected subset with finite Hofer-Zehnder capacity and an isotropic CW-complex. Moreover, we prove that if (M,\Sigma) is subcritical then M\setminus\Sigma has finite Hofer-Zehnder capacity.   We also show that given a hyperbolic surface M and TM endowed with the twisted symplectic form \om_0 + \pi^*\Om, where \Om is the area form on M, then the Hofer-Zehnder G-semicapacity of the domain bounded by the hypersurface of kinetic energy k minus the zero section M_0 is finite if k\leq 1/2, where G \subset \pi_1(TM\setminus M_0) is the subgroup generated by the fibers of SM.
