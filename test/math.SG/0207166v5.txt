Exploiting a notion of Kaehler structure on a stratified space introduced elsewhere we show that, in the Kaehler case, reduction after quantization coincides with quantization after reduction: Key tools developed for that purpose are stratified polarizations and stratified prequantum modules, the latter generalizing prequantum bundles. These notions encapsulate, in particular, the behaviour of a polarization and that of a prequantum bundle across the strata. Our main result says that, for a positive Kaehler manifold with a hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group, when suitable additional conditions are imposed, reduction after quantization coincides with quantization after reduction in the sense that not only the reduced and unreduced quantum phase spaces correspond but the (invariant) unreduced and reduced quantum observables as well. Over a stratified space, the appropriate quantum phase space is a costratified Hilbert space in such a way that the costratified structure reflects the stratification. Examples of stratified Kaehler spaces arise from the closures of holomorphic nilpotent orbits including angular momentum zero reduced spaces, and from representations of compact Lie groups. For illustration, we carry out Kaehler quantization on various spaces of that kind including singular Fock spaces.
