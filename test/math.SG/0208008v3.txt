We review the definition of geometric quantization, which begins with defining a mathematical framework for the algebra of observables that holds equally well for classical and quantum mechanics. We then discuss prequantization, and go into details of the general method of quantization with respect to a polarization using densities and half-forms. This has applications to the theory of unitary group representations and coadjoint orbits.
