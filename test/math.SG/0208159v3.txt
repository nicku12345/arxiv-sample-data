We derive a generalization of the classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (CDYBE) on a self-dual Lie algebra \cal G by replacing the cotangent bundle T^*G in a geometric interpretation of this equation by its Poisson-Lie (PL) analogue associated with a factorizable constant r-matrix on \cal G. The resulting PL-CDYBE, with variables in the Lie group G equipped with the Semenov-Tian-Shansky Poisson bracket based on the constant r-matrix, coincides with an equation that appeared in an earlier study of PL symmetries in the WZNW model. In addition to its new group theoretic interpretation, we present a self-contained analysis of those solutions of the PL-CDYBE that were found in the WZNW context and characterize them by means of a uniqueness result under a certain analyticity assumption.
