The focus of these lectures is the Gopakumar-Vafa's insight that ``Large N dualities'' (relating gauge theories and closed strings) are realized, in certain cases, by "transition in geometry". In their pivotal 1998 example, the gauge theory is SU(N) Chern-Simons theory on S^3, for large N, and the transition is the "conifold" transition between two Calabi--Yau varieties. Much progress has been made to support Gopakumar and Vafa's conjecture, including the lift of the transition to a transformation between 7-manifolds with G_2 holonomy. In another direction, this set up brings us to consider the uncharted territory of "open Gromov-Witten invariants". The lectures, hence the notes, were prepared for an audience of beginning graduate students, in mathematics and physics, whom we hope to get interested in this subject. Because most of the material presented in these lectures comes from the physics literature, we aimed to build a bridge for the mathematicians towards the physics papers on the subject.
