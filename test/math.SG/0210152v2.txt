We show that various notions of integrability for Poisson brackets are all equivalent, and we give the precise obstructions to integrating Poisson manifolds. We describe the integration as a symplectic quotient, in the spirit of the Poisson sigma-model of Cattaneo and Felder. For regular Poisson manifolds we express the obstructions in terms of variations of symplectic areas. As an application of these results, we show that a Poisson manifold admits a complete symplectic realization if, and only if, it is integrable. We discuss also the integration of submanifolds and Morita equivalence of Poisson manifolds.
