There is a simple and natural quantization of differential forms on odd Poisson supermanifolds, given by the relation [f,dg]={f,g} for any two functions f and g. We notice that this non-commutative differential algebra has a geometrical realization as a convolution algebra of the symplectic groupoid integrating the Poisson manifold.   This quantization is just a part of a quantization of the odd symplectic category (where objects are odd symplectic supermanifolds and morphisms are Lagrangian relation) in terms of Z_2-graded chain complexes. It is a straightforward consequence of the theory of BV operator acting on semidensities, due to H. Khudaverdian.
