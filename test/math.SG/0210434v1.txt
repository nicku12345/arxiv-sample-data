Let mathcal{O}_lambda be a generic coadjoint orbit of a compact semi-simple Lie group K. Weight varieties are the symplectic reductions of mathcal{O}_lambda by the maximal torus T in K. We use a theorem of Tolman and Weitsman to compute the cohomology ring of these varieties. Our formula relies on a Schubert basis of the equivariant cohomology of \mathcal{O}_lambda and it makes explicit the dependence on \lambda and a parameter in Lie(T)^*.
