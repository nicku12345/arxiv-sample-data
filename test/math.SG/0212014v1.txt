For a maximally entangled eigenstate of a system of two non-interacting identical one dimensional harmonic oscilators, at the semiclassical level, it is not obviously true that a nonlinear interaction with one of the subsystems leaves the reduced semiclassical Wigner function of the other subsystem unaffected. Once stated, we advance some wild speculations regarding this seeming puzzle.
