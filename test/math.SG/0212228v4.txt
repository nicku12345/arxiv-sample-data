We study noncommutative generalizations of such notions of the classical symplectic geometry as degenerate Poisson structure, Poisson submanifold and quotient manifold, symplectic foliation and symplectic leaf for associative Poisson algebras. We consider these structures for the case of the endomorphism algebra of a vector bundle, and give the full description of the family of Poisson structures for this algebra.
