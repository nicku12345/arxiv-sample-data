In these notes we consider the usual Fedosov star product on a symplectic manifold (M,\omega) emanating from the fibrewise Weyl product \circ, a symplectic torsion free connection \nabla on M, a formal series \Omega \in \nu Z^2_{\rm\tiny dR}(M)[[\nu]] of closed two-forms on M and a certain formal series s of symmetric contravariant tensor fields on M. For a given symplectic vector field X on M we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the triple (\nabla,\Omega,s) determining the star product * on which the Lie derivative \Lie_X with respect to X is a derivation of *. Moreover, we also give additional conditions on which \Lie_X is even a quasi-inner derivation. Using these results we find necessary and sufficient criteria for a Fedosov star product to be \mathfrak g-invariant and to admit a quantum Hamiltonian. Finally, supposing the existence of a quantum Hamiltonian, we present a cohomological condition on \Omega that is equivalent to the existence of a quantum momentum mapping. In particular, our results show that the existence of a classical momentum mapping in general does not imply the existence of a quantum momentum mapping.
