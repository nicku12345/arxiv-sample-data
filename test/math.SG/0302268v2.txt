Poisson manifolds may be regarded as the infinitesimal form of symplectic groupoids. Twisted Poisson manifolds considered by Severa and Weinstein [math.SG/0107133] are a natural generalization of the former which also arises in string theory. In this note it is proved that twisted Poisson manifolds are in bijection with a (possibly singular) twisted version of symplectic groupoids.
