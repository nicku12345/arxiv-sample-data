We define an simple invariant of an embedded nullhomologous Lagrangian torus and use this invariant to show that many symplectic 4-manifolds have infinitely many pairwise symplectically inequivalent nullhomologous Lagrangian tori. We further show that for a large class of examples that lambda(T) is actually a C-infinity invariant. In addition, this invariant is used to show that many symplectic 4-manifolds have nontrivial homology classes which are represented by infinitely many pairwise inequivalent Lagrangian tori, a result first proved by S Vidussi for the homotopy K3-surface obtained from knot surgery using the trefoil knot in [Lagrangian surfaces in a fixed homology class: existence of knotted Lagrangian tori, J. Diff. Geom. (to appear)].
