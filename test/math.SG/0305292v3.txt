In this paper, we study deformations of coisotropic submanifolds in a symplectic manifold. First we derive the equation that governs C^\infty deformations of coisotropic submanifolds and define the corresponding C^\infty-moduli space of coisotropic submanifolds modulo the Hamiltonian isotopies. This is a non-commutative and non-linear generalization of the well-known description of the local deformation space of Lagrangian submanifolds as the set of graphs of {\it closed} one forms in the Darboux-Weinstein chart of a given Lagrangian submanifold. We then introduce the notion of {\it strong homotopy Lie algebroid} (or {\it L_\infty-algebroid}) and associate a canonical isomorphism class of strong homotopy Lie algebroids to each pre-symplectic manifold (Y,\omega) and identify the formal deformation space of coisotropic embeddings into a symplectic manifold in terms of this strong homotopy Lie algebroid. The formal moduli space then is provided by the gauge equivalence classes of solutions of a version of the {\it Maurer-Cartan equation} (or the {\it master equation}) of the strong homotopy Lie algebroid, and plays the role of the classical part of the moduli space of quantum deformation space of coisotropic A-branes. We provide a criterion for the unobstructedness of the deformation problem and analyze a family of examples that illustrates that this deformation problem is obstructed in general and heavily depends on the geometry and dynamics of the null foliation.
