In the present paper the non-Noether symmetries of the Toda model, nonlinear Schodinger equation and Korteweg-de Vries equations (KdV and mKdV) are discussed. It appears that these symmetries yield the complete sets of conservation laws in involution and lead to the bi-Hamiltonian realizations of the above mentioned models.
