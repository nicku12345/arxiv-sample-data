We give a systematic presentation of the stability theory in the non-algebraic Kaehlerian geometry. We introduce the concept of "energy complete Hamiltonian action". To an energy complete Hamiltonian action of a reductive group G on a complex manifold one can associate a G-equivariant maximal weight function and prove a Hilbert criterion for semistability. In other words, for such actions, the symplectic semistability and analytic semistability conditions are equivalent.
