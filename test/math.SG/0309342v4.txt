In this paper, we will give a complete geometric background for the geometry of Painlev\'e VI and Garnier equations. By geometric invariant theory, we will construct a smooth coarse moduli space M_n^{\balpha}(\bt, \blambda, L)  of stable parabolic connection on \BP^1 with logarithmic poles at D(\bt) = t_1 + ... + t_n as well as its natural compactification. Moreover the moduli space \cR(\cP_{n, \bt})_{\ba} of Jordan equivalence classes of SL_2(\C)-representations of the fundamental group \pi_1(\BP^1 \setminus D(\bt),\ast) are defined as the categorical quotient. We define the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence \RH: M_n^{\balpha}(\bt, \blambda, L) \lra \cR(\cP_{n, \bt})_{\ba} and prove that \RH is a bimeromorphic proper surjective analytic map. Painlev\'e and Garnier equations can be derived from the isomonodromic flows and Painlev\'e property of these equations are easily derived from the properties of \RH. We also prove that the smooth parts of both moduli spaces have natural symplectic structures and \RH is a symplectic resolution of singularities of \cR(\cP_{n, \bt})_{\ba}, from which one can give geometric backgrounds for other interesting phenomena, like Hamiltonian structures, B\"acklund transformations, special solutions of these equations.
