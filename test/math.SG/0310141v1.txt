We study an integration theory in circle equivariant cohomology in order to prove a theorem relating the cohomology ring of a hyperkahler quotient to the cohomology ring of the quotient by a maximal abelian subgroup, analogous to a theorem of Martin for symplectic quotients. We discuss applications of this theorem to quiver varieties, and compute as an example the ordinary and equivariant cohomology rings of a hyperpolygon space.
