We prove that any two irreducible cuspidal Hurwitz curves C_0 and C_1 (or more generally, curves with A-type singularities) in the Hirzebruch surface F_N with coinciding homology classes and sets of singularities are regular homotopic; and symplectically regular homotopic if C_0 and C_1 are symplectic with respect to a compatible symplectic form.
