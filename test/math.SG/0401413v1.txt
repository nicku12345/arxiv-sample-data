We classify four-dimensional compact solvmanifolds up to diffeomorphism, while determining which of them have complex analytic structures. In particular, we shall see that a four-dimensional compact solvmanifold S can be written, up to double covering, as G/L where G is a simply connected solvable Lie group and L is a lattice of G, and every complex structure J on S is the canonical complex structure induced from a left-invariant complex structure on G. We also give a complete list of all the complex structures on four-dimensional compact homogeneous spaces, referring to their corresponding complex surfaces.
