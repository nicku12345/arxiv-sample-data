We study the problem of counting instantons with coassociative boundary condition in (almost) G_(2)-manifolds. This is analog to the open Gromov-Witten theory for counting holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary condition in Calabi-Yau manifolds. We explain its relationship with the Seiberg-Witten invariants for coassociative submanifolds.
