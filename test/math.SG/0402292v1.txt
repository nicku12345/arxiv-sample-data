We give a complete description of differential operators generating a given bracket. In particular we consider the case of Jacobi-type identities for odd operators and brackets. This is related with homotopy algebras using the derived bracket construction.   (Based on a talk at XXII Workshop on Geometric Methods in Physics at Bialowieza)
