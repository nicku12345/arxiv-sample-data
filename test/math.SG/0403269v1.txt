We start by describing the relationship between the classical prequantization condition and the integrability of a certain Lie algebroid associated to the problem and use this to give a global construction of the prequantizing bundle in terms of path spaces (Introduction), then we rephrase the problem in terms of groupoids (second section), and then we study the more general problem of prequantizing groupoids endowed with a multiplicative 2-forms (the rest of the paper).
