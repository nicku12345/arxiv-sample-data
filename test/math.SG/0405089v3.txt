Using the symplectic geometry of certain manifolds which appear naturally in Lie theory, we define an invariant which assigns a graded abelian group to an oriented link. The relevant manifolds are transverse slices to certain nilpotent orbits inside sl_{2m}, and intersections of those with regular semisimple orbits. The invariant is conjectured to be equal to Khovanov's combinatorially defined homology theory (with the bigrading of that theory collapsed in a certain way).
