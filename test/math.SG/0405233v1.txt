Let X be a Kahler manifold that is presented as a Kahler quotient of C^n by the linear action of a compact group G. We define the hyperkahler analogue M of X as a hyperkahler quotient of the cotangent bundle T^*C^n by the induced G-action. Special instances of this construction include hypertoric varieties and quiver varieties. Our aim is to provide a unified treatment of these two previously studied examples, with specific attention to the geometry and topology of the circle action on M that descends from the scalar action on the fibers of the cotangent bundle. We provide a detailed study of this action in the cases where M is a hypertoric variety or a hyperpolygon space.
