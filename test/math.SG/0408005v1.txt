A nonholonomic system consists of a configuration space Q, a Lagrangian L, and an nonintegrable constraint distribution H, with dynamics governed by Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle. We present two studies both using adapted moving frames. In the first study we apply Cartan's method of equivalence to investigate the geometry underlying a nonholonomic system. As an example we compute the differential invariants for a nonholonomic system on a four-dimensional configuration manifold endowed with a rank two (Engel) distribution. In the second part we study G-Chaplygin systems. These are systems where the constraint distribution is given by a connection on a principal fiber bundle with total space Q and base space S=Q/G, and with a G-equivariant Lagrangian. These systems compress to an almost Hamiltonian system on T^{*}S. Under an s \in S dependent time reparameterization a number of compressed systems become Hamiltonian. A necessary condition for Hamiltonization is the existence of an invariant measure on the original system. Assuming an invariant measure we describe the obstruction to Hamiltonization. Chaplygin's "rubber" sphere, a ball with unequal inertia coefficients rolling without slipping or spinning (about the vertical axis) on a plane is Hamiltonizable when compressed to T^{*}SO(3). Finally we discuss reduction of internal symmetries. Chaplygin's "marble" (where spinning is allowed) is not Hamiltonizable when compressed to T^{*}SO(3); we conjecture that it is also not Hamiltonizable when reduced to T^{*}S^{2}.
