This is an expansion on my talk at the Geometry and Topology conference at McMaster University, May 2004.   We outline a program to relate the Heegaard Floer homologies of Ozsvath-Szabo, and Seiberg-Witten-Floer homologies as defined by Kronheimer-Mrowka. The center-piece of this program is the construction of an intermediate version of Floer theory, which exhibits characteristics of both theories.
