We develop a bundle picture for the case that the configuration manifold has only a single isotropy type, and give a formula for the reduced symplectic form in this setting. Furthermore, as an application of this bundle picture we consider Calogero-Moser systems with spin associated to polar representations of compact Lie groups.
