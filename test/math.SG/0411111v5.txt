In the previous paper, the author defined equivariant Floer cohomology for a complete intersection in a toric variety and showed that it is isomorphic to the small quantum D-module after a mirror transformation when the first Chern class c_1(M) of the tangent bundle is nef. In this paper, even when c_1(M) is not nef, we show that the equivariant Floer cohomology reconstructs the big quantum D-module under certain conditions on the ambient toric variety. The proof is based on a mirror theorem by Coates and Givental. The reconstruction procedure here gives a generalized mirror transformation first observed by Jinzenji in low degrees.
