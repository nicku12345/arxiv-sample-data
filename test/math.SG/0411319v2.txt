We consider energy-minimizing divergence-free eigenfields of the curl operator in dimension three from the perspective of contact topology. We give a negative answer to a question of Etnyre and the first author by constructing curl eigenfields which minimize L^2 energy on their co-adjoint orbit, yet are orthogonal to an overtwisted contact structure. We conjecture that K-contact structures on S^1-bundles always define tight minimizers, and prove a partial result in this direction.
