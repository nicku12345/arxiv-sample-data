In a deformation quantization of \Real^n, the Jacobi identity is automatically satisfied. This article poses the contrary question: Given a set of commutators which satisfies the Jacobi identity, is the resulting associative algebra a deformation quantization of \Real^n? It is shown that the result is true. However care must taken when stating precisely how and in which algebra the Jacobi identity is satisfied.
