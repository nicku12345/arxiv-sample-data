We study the classification of Lefschetz fibrations up to stabilization by fiber sum operations. We show that for each genus there is a `universal' fibration f^0_g with the property that, if two Lefschetz fibrations over S^2 have the same Euler-Poincare characteristic and signature, the same numbers of reducible singular fibers of each type, and admit sections with the same self-intersection, then after repeatedly fiber summing with f^0_g they become isomorphic. As a consequence, any two compact integral symplectic 4-manifolds with the same values of (c_1^2, c_2, c_1.[w], [w]^2) become symplectomorphic after blowups and symplectic sums with f^0_g.
