We study a generalization of the isomonodromic deformation to the case of connections with irregular singularities. We call this generalization Isostokes Deformation. A new deformation parameter arises: one can deform the formal normal forms of connections at irregular points. We study this part of the deformation, giving an algebraic description. Then we show how to use loop groups and hypercohomology to write explicit hamiltonians. We work on an arbitrary complete algebraic curve, the structure group is an arbitrary semisimiple group.
