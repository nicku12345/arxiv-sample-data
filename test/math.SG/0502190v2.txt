We give a brief introduction to the Berline-Vergne localization formula for the finite-dimensional setting and indicate how the Duistermaat-Heckman formula is derived from it. We consider applications of the localization formula when it is specialized to a maximal dimensional co-adjoint orbit. In particular, the case when the co-adjoint orbit is a quotient G/T of a connected Lie group G modulo a maximal torus T is analyzed in detail. We describe also a generalization of the localization formula to non-compact group actions.
