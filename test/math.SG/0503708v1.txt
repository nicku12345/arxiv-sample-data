We study the Weyl representation of metaplectic operators associated to a symplectic matrix having no non-trivial fixed point, and justify a formula suggested in earlier work of Mehlig and Wilkinson. We give precise calculations of the associated Maslov-type indices; these indices intervene in a crucial way in Gutzwiller's formula of semiclassical mechanics, and are simply related to an index defined by Conley and Zehnder.
