The recent example of Hanges: P = \partial_t^2 + t^2\Delta_x + \partial^2_{\theta(x)} in R^3 is analytic hypoelliptic in the sense of germs but not in the strong sense in any neighborhood of the origin. And its characteristic variety is non-symplectic. We give a purely L^2, and hence quite flexible, proof of this result and generalizations, and link it to, and contrast it with, the celebrated Baouendi-Goulaouic operator. We point out that the results are consistent with the conjecture of Treves.
