Given a symplectic manifold M, we may define an operad structure on the the spaces \op^k of the Lagrangian submanifolds of (\bar{M})^k\times M via symplectic reduction. If M is also a symplectic groupoid, then its multiplication space is an associative product in this operad. Following this idea, we provide a deformation theory for symplectic groupoids analog to the deformation theory of algebras. It turns out that the semi-classical part of Kontsevich's deformation of C^\infty(\R^d) is a deformation of the trivial symplectic groupoid structure of T^*\R^d.
