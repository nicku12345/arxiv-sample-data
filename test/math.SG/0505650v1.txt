In this paper we prove local analytic hypoellipticity for a degenerate sum of squares of complex vector fields generalizing those of Kohn in "Hypoellipticity and Loss of Derivatives". Kohn's article is to appear in the Annals of Mathematics with an appendix by Derridj and Tartakoff proving local analyticity in that case. Here we consider vector fields corresponding to a CR manifold of finite type so there is a kind of double degeneracy, and prove local analyticity using our balanced localization of high derivatives in the "missing" direction T. In a forthcoming paper, Bove, Derridj, Kohn and Tartakoff will use these techniques to prove hypoellipticity for both classes of operators.
