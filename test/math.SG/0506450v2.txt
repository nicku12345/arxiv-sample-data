We show that several standard associative quantizations in mathematical physics can be expressed as cochain module-algebra twists in the spirit of Moyal products at least to O(\hbar^3), but to achieve this we twist not by a 2-cocycle but by a 2-cochain. This implies a hidden nonassociavitity not visible in the algebra itself but present in its deeper noncommutative differential geometry, a phenomenon first seen in our previous work on semiclassicalisation of differential structures. The quantisations are induced by a classical group covariance and include: enveloping algebras U_\hbar(g) as quantisations of g^*, a Fedosov-type quantisation of the sphere S^2 under a Lorentz group covariance, the Mackey quantisation of homogeneous spaces, and the standard quantum groups C_q[G]. We also consider the differential quantisation of R^n for a given symplectic connection as part of our semiclassical analysis and we outline a proposal for the Dirac operator.
