We consider the Poisson reduced space (T^*Q)/K with respect to a cotangent lifted action. It is assumed that K is a compact Lie group which acts by isometries on the Riemannian manifold Q and that the action on Q is of single isotropy type. Realizing (T^*Q)/K as a Weinstein space we determine the induced Poisson structure and its symplectic leaves. We thus extend the Weinstein construction for principal fiber bundles to the case of surjective Riemannian submersions Q\to Q/K.
