We study reduction of generalized complex structures. More precisely, we investigate the following question. Let J be a generalized complex structure on a manifold M, which admits an action of a Lie group G preserving J. Assume that M_0 is a G-invariant smooth submanifold and the G-action on M_0 is proper and free so that M_G:=M_0/G is a smooth manifold. Under what condition does J descend to a generalized complex structure on M_G? We describe a sufficient condition for the reduction to hold, which includes the Marsden-Weinstein reduction of symplectic manifolds and the reduction of the complex structures in K\"ahler manifolds as special cases. As an application, we study reduction of generalized K\"ahler manifolds.
