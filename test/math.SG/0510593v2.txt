Suppose given a complex projective manifold M with a fixed Hodge form \Omega. The Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifolds of (M,\Omega) are the geometric counterpart to semi-classical physical states, and their geometric quantization has been extensively studied. Here we revisit this theory in the equivariant context, in the presence of a compatible (Hamiltonian) action of a connected compact Lie group.
