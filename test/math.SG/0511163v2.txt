A Fourier transform technique is introduced for counting the number of solutions of holomorphic moment map equations over a finite field. This in turn gives information on Betti numbers of holomorphic symplectic quotients. As a consequence simple unified proofs are obtained for formulas of Poincare polynomials of toric hyperkahler varieties, Poincare polynomials of Hilbert schemes of points and twisted ADHM spaces of instantons on C^2 and Poincare polynomials of all Nakajima quiver varieties. As an application, a proof of a conjecture of Kac on the number of absolutely indecomposable representations of a quiver is announced.
