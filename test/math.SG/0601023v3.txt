In this paper we deal with a Hamiltonian action of a reductive algebraic group G on an irreducible normal affine Poisson variety X. We study the invariant moment map \psi_{G,X}:X\to \g, that is, the composition of the moment map \mu_{G,X}:X\to g:=Lie(G) and the quotient morphism g\to g\quo G. We obtain some results on the dimensions of fibers of \psi_{G,X} and the corresponding morphism of quotients X\quo G\to g\quo G. We also study the "Stein factorisation" of \psi_{G,X}. Namely, let C_{G,X} denote the spectrum of the integral closure of \psi_{G,X}^*(K[g]^G) in K(X)^G. We investigate the structure of the g\quo G-scheme C_{G,X}. Our results partially generalize those obtained by F. Knop in the case of the actions on cotangent bundles and symplectic vector spaces.
