Suppose that a Lie group G acts properly on a configuration manifold Q. We study the symplectic quotient of T^*Q with respect to the cotangent lifted G-action at an arbitrary coadjoint orbit level \mathcal{O}. In particular, if Q=Q_{(H)} is of single orbit type we show that the symplectic quotient of T^*Q at \mathcal{O} can be constructed through a minimal coupling procedure involving the smaller cotangent bundle T^*Q_H, the symplectic quotient of \mathcal{O} at 0 with respect to the H-action, and the diagonal Hamiltonian N(H)/H-action on these symplectic spaces. A prescribed connection on Q_H\to Q_H/(N(H)/H) then yields a computationally effective way of explicitly realizing the symplectic structure on each stratum of the symplectic quotient of T^*Q. In an example this result is combined with the projection method to produce a stratified Hamiltonian system with very well hidden symmetries.
