Let M be a complex projective manifold, and L an Hermitian ample line bundle on it. A fundamental theorem of Gang Tian, reproved and strengthened by Zelditch, implies that the Khaeler form of L can be recovered from the asymptotics of the projective embeddings associated to large tensor powers of L. More precisely, with the natural choice of metrics the projective embeddings associated to the full linear series |kL| are asymptotically symplectic, in the appropriate rescaled sense. In this article, we ask whether and how this result extends to the semiclassical setting. Specifically, we relate the Weinstein symplectic structure on a given isodrastic leaf of half-weighted Bohr-Sommerfeld Lagrangian submanifolds of M to the asymptotics of the the pull-back of the Fubini-Study form under the semiclassical projective maps constructed by Borthwick, Paul and Uribe.
