An \emph{\omega-admissible almost complex structure} on a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold (M,\omega) is a \omega-calibrated almost complex structure J admitting a nowhere vanishing \bar{\partial}_J-closed (n,0)-form \psi. After giving some examples we consider the moduli space of admissible almost complex structures and we study infinitesimal deformations. As special case, we write down explicit computations for the complex torus.
