We consider the St\"ackel transform, also known as the coupling-constant metamorphosis, which under certain conditions turns a Hamiltonian dynamical system into another such system and preserves the Liouville integrability. We show that the corresponding transformation for the equations of motion is nothing but the reciprocal transformation of a special form and we investigate the properties of this transformation. This result is further applied for the study of the k-hole deformations of the Benenti systems or more general seed systems.
