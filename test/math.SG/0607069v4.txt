Let X be a topological space upon which a compact connected Lie group G acts. It is well-known that the equivariant cohomology H_G^*(X;\Q) is isomorphic to the subalgebra of Weyl group invariants of the equivariant cohomology H_T^*(X;\Q), where T is a maximal torus of G. This relationship breaks down for coefficient rings \k other than \Q. Instead, we prove that under a mild condition on \k the algebra H_G^*(X,\k) is isomorphic to the subalgebra of H_T^*(X,\k) annihilated by the divided difference operators.
