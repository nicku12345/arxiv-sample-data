Interpretation of dispersionless integrable hierarchies as equations of coisotropic deformations for certain algebras and other algebraic structures like Jordan triple systInterpretation of dispersionless integrable hierarchies as equations of coisotropic deformations for certain algebras and other algebraic structures like Jordan triple systems is discussed. Several generalizations are considered. Stationary reductions of the dispersionless integrable equations are shown to be connected with the dynamical systems on the plane completely integrable on a fixed energy level. ems is discussed.
