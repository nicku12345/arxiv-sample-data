Simple classical mechanical systems and solution spaces of classical field theories involve singularities. In certain situations these singularities can be understood in terms of stratified Kaehler spaces. We give an overview of a research program whose aim is to develop a holomorphic quantization procedure on stratified Kaehler spaces.
