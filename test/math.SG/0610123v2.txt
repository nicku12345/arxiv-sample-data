We study a Poisson structure \pi on the Grothendieck resolution X of a complex semi-simple group G and prove that the desingularization map \mu:(X,\pi) \to (G,\pi_0) is Poisson, where \pi_0 is a Poisson structure such that intersections of conjugacy classes and opposite Bruhat cells BwB_- are Poisson subvarieties. We compute the symplectic leaves of X and show that (X, \pi) resolves singularities of (G, \pi_0).
