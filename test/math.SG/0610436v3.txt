In this paper we study the topology of the space \I_\omega of complex structures compatible with a fixed symplectic form \omega, using the framework of Donaldson. By comparing our analysis of the space \I_\omega with results of McDuff on the space \cat J_\omega of compatible almost complex structures on rational ruled surfaces, we find that \I_\omega is contractible in this case. We then apply this result to study the topology of the symplectomorphism group of a rational ruled surface, extending results of Abreu and McDuff.
