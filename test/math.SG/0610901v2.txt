Holomorphic disk invariants with boundary in the real Lagrangian of a quintic 3-fold are calculated by localization and proven mirror transforms. A careful discussion of the underlying virtual intersection theory is included. The generating function for the disk invariants is shown to satisfy an extension of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated to the mirror quintic. The Ooguri-Vafa multiple cover formula is used to define virtually enumerative disk invariants. The results may also be viewed as providing a virtual enumeration of real rational curves on the quintic.
