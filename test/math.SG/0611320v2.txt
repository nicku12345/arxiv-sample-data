In this paper we find connection between the Hofer's metric of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold, with an integral symplectic form, and the geometry, defined in a paper by Eliashberg and Polterovich, of the quantomorphisms group of its prequantization manifold. This gives two main results: First, we calculate, partly, the geometry of the quantomorphisms groups of a prequantization manifolds of an integral symplectic manifold which admits certain Lagrangian foliation. Second, for every prequantization manifold we give a formula for the distance between a point and a distinguished curve in the metric space associated to its group of quantomorphisms.   Moreover, our first result is a full computation of the geometry related to the symplectic linear group which can be considered as a subgroup of the contactomorphisms group of suitable prequantization manifolds of the complex projective space.   In the course of the proof we use in an essential way the Maslov quasimorphism.
