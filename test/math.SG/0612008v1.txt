We introduce the \theta-twistor which is a new supersymmetric generalization of the Penrose twistor and is also alternative to the supertwistor. The \theta-twistor is a triple of {\it spinors} including the spinor \theta extending the Penrose's double of spinors. Using the \theta-twistors yields an infinite chain of massless higher spin chiral supermultiplets ({1/2},1), (1, {3/2}), ({3/2},2),...,(S, S+{1/2}) generalizing the known scalar (0,{1/2}) supermultiplet
