We show that certain submanifolds of generalized complex manifolds ("weak branes") admit a natural quotient which inherits a generalized complex structure. This is analog to quotienting coisotropic submanifolds of symplectic manifolds. In particular Gualtieri's generalized complex submanifolds ("branes") quotient to space-filling branes. Along the way we perform reductions by foliations (i.e. no group action is involved) for exact Courant algebroids - interpreting the reduced \v{S}evera class - and for Dirac structures.
