The paper explores some algebraic constructions arising in the theory of Lefschetz fibrations. Specifically, it covers in a fair amount of detail the algebraic issues outlined in ``Symplectic homology as Hochschild homology'' (math.SG/0609037). We also explain how the theory works when applied to a simple example, namely the Landau-Ginzburg mirror of P^2.   Version 2: revised, many technical assumptions dropped, statement of one of the main results improved by using dg quotients. I changed the title accordingly.
