In this paper we prove the Conley conjecture and the almost existence theorem in a neighborhood of a closed nowhere coisotropic submanifold under certain natural assumptions on the ambient symplectic manifold. Essential to the proofs is a displacement principle for such submanifolds. Namely, we show that a topologically displaceable nowhere coisotropic submanifold is also displaceable by a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, partially extending the well-known non-Lagrangian displacement property.
