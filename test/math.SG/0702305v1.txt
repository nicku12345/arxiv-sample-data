For an (m+1)-dimensional space-time (X^{m+1}, g), define a mapped null hypersurface to be a smooth map \nu:N^{m}\to X^{m+1} (that is not necessarily an immersion) such that there exists a smooth field of null lines along \nu that are both tangent and g-orthogonal to \nu. We study relations between mapped null hypersurfaces and Legendrian maps to the spherical cotangent bundle ST^*M of an immersed spacelike hypersurface \mu:M^m\to X^{m+1}. We show that a Legendrian map \wt \lambda: L^{m-1}\to (ST^*M)^{2m-1} defines a mapped null hypersurface in X. On the other hand, the intersection of a mapped null hypersurface \nu:N^m\to X^{m+1} with an immersed spacelike hypersurface \mu':M'^m\to X^{m+1} defines a Legendrian map to the spherical cotangent bundle ST^*M'. This map is a Legendrian immersion if \nu came from a Legendrian immersion to ST^*M for some immersed spacelike hypersurface \mu:M^m\to X^{m+1}.
