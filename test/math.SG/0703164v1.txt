As an explicit example of an A_\infty-structure associated to geometry, we construct an A_\infty-structure for a Fukaya category of finitely many lines (Lagrangians) in \R^2, ie., we define also {\em non-transversal} A_\infty-products. This construction is motivated by homological mirror symmetry of (two-)tori, where \R^2 is the covering space of a two-torus. The strategy is based on an algebraic reformulation of Morse homotopy theory through homological perturbation theory (HPT) as discussed by Kontsevich and Soibelman in math.SG/0011041, where we introduce a special DG category which is a key idea of our construction.
