Karshon constructed the first counterexample to the log-concavity conjecture for the Duistermaat-Heckman measure: a Hamiltonian six manifold whose fixed points set is the disjoint union of two copies of T^4. In this article, for any closed symplectic four manifold N with b+ greater than 1, we show that there is a Hamiltonian six manifold M such that its fixed points set is the disjoint union of two copies of N and such that its Duistermaat-Heckman function is not log-concave.   On the other hand, we prove that if there is a torus action of complexity two such that all the symplectic reduced spaces taken at regular values satisfy the condition b+=1, then its Duistermaat-Heckman function has to be log-concave. As a consequence, we prove the log-concavity conjecture for Hamiltonian circle actions on six manifolds such that the fixed points sets have no four dimensional components, or only have four dimensional pieces with b+=1.
