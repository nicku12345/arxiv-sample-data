This is the revised version of the second paper in a series introducing a generalized Fredholm theory in a new class of smooth spaces called polyfolds. The theory will be illustrated in upcoming papers by applications to Floer Theory, Gromov-Witten Theory and Symplectic Field Theory.   Some proofs have been improved and a glossary added.
