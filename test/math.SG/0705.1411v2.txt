We consider the osp(1|2)-invariant bilinear operations on weighted densities on the supercircle S^{1|1} called the supertransvectants. These operations are analogues of the famous Gordan transvectants (or Rankin-Cohen brackets). We prove that these operations coincide with the iterated Poisson and ghost Poisson brackets on {\mathbb R}^{2|1} and apply this result to construct star-products involving the supertransvectants.
