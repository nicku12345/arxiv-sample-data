The main purpose of this work is to develop the basic notions of the Lie theory for commutative algebras. We introduce a class of \mathbbZ_2-graded commutative but not associative algebras that we call ``Lie antialgebras''. These algebras are closely related to Lie (super)algebras and, in some sense, link together commutative and Lie algebras. The main notions we define in this paper are: representations of Lie antialgebras, an analog of the Lie-Poisson bivector (which is not Poisson) and central extensions. We also classify simple finite-dimensional Lie antialgebras.
