We study the geometry of complexified moduli spaces of special Lagrangian submanifolds in the complement of an anticanonical divisor in a compact Kahler manifold. In particular, we explore the connections between T-duality and mirror symmetry in concrete examples, and show how quantum corrections arise in this context.
