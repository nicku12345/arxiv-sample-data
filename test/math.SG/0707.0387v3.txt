In this article, we formulate a planar limited version of the B-side in homological mirror symmetry that formularizes Chern-Simons-type topological open string field theory using homotopy associative algebra (A_{\infty} algebra). This formulation is based on the works by Dijkgraaf and Vafa. We show that our formularization includes gravity/gauge theory correspondence which originates in the AdS/CFT duality of Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory.
