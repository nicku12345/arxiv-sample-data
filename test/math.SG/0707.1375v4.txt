Let \gamma be an automorphism of a polarized complex projective manifold (M,L). Then \gamma induces an automorphism \gamma_k of the space of global holomorphic sections of the k-th tensor power of L, for every k=1,2,...; for k\gg 0, the Lefschetz fixed point formula expresses the trace of \gamma_k in terms of fixed point data. More generally, one may consider the composition of \gamma_k with the Toeplitz operator associated to some smooth function on M. Still more generally, in the presence of the compatible action of a compact and connected Lie group preserving (M,L,\gamma), one may consider induced linear maps on the equivariant summands associated to the irreducible representations of G. In this paper, under familiar assumptions in the theory of symplectic reductions, we show that the traces of these maps admit an asymptotic expansion as k\to +\infty, and compute its leading term.
