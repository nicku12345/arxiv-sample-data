A generalized Courant algebroid structure is defined on the direct sum bundle D(E) +J(E), where D(E) and J(E) are the gauge Lie algebroid and the jet bundle of a vector bundle E respectively. Such a structure is called an omni-Lie algebroid since it is reduced to the omni-Lie algebra introduced by A.Weinstein if the base manifold is a point. We prove that any Lie algebroid structure on E is characterized by a Dirac structure as the graph of a bundle map from J(E) to D(E).
