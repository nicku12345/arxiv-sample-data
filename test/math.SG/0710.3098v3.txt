After a brief summary of the main properties of Poisson manifolds and Lie algebroids in general, we survey recent work on the modular classes of Poisson and twisted Poisson manifolds, of Lie algebroids with a Poisson or twisted Poisson structure, and of Poisson-Nijenhuis manifolds. A review of the spinor approach to the modular class concludes the paper.
