The purpose of this article is to view Penrose rhombus tilings from the perspective of symplectic geometry. We show that each thick rhombus in such a tiling can be naturally associated to a highly singular 4-dimensional compact symplectic space, while each thin rhombus can be associated to another such space; both spaces are invariant under the Hamiltonian action of a 2-dimensional quasitorus, and the images of the corresponding moment mappings give the rhombuses back. These two spaces are diffeomorphic but not symplectomorphic.
