We prove that if f is a C^1-generic symplectic diffeomorphism then the Oseledets splitting along almost every orbit is either trivial or partially hyperbolic. In addition, if f is not Anosov then all the exponents in the center bundle vanish. This establishes in full a result announced by R. Ma\~{n}\'{e} in the ICM 1983. The main technical novelty is a probabilistic method for the construction of perturbations, using random walks.
