Given a smooth compact Riemannian manifold M and a Hamiltonian H on the cotangent space T^*M, strictly convex and superlinear in the momentum variables, we prove uniqueness of certain ergodic invariant Lagrangian graphs within a given homology or cohomology class. In particular, in the context of quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems, our result implies global uniqueness of Lagrangian KAM tori with rotation vector \rho. This result extends generically to the C^0-closure of KAM tori.
