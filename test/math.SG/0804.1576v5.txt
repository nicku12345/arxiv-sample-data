We formulate the homotopy associative (A_\infty) category of D-particle field states via gauged S-duality. By invoking the minimal model theorem of this D-particle field category, we investigate the equivalence principle and the A_\infty covariance principle in the theory of gauged S-duality considered as D-particle field theory.
