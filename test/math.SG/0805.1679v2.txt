We prove the action-angle theorem in the general, and most natural, context of integrable systems on Poisson manifolds, thereby generalizing the classical proof, which is given in the context of symplectic manifolds. The topological part of the proof parallels the proof of the symplectic case, but the rest of the proof is quite different, since we are naturally led to using the calculus of polyvector fields, rather than differential forms; in particular, we use in the end a Poisson version of the classical Caratheodory-Jacobi-Lie theorem, which we also prove. At the end of the article, we generalize the action-angle theorem to the setting of non-commutative integrable systems on Poisson manifolds.
