Let \lambda: \tilde{G}\to G be the non-trivial double covering of the symplectic group G=Sp(V,\omega) of the symplectic vector space (V,\omega) by the metaplectic group \tilde{G}=Mp(V,\omega). In this case, \lambda is also a representation of \tilde{G} on the vector space V and thus, it gives rise to the representation of \tilde{G} on the space of exterior forms \bigwedge^{\bullet}V^* by taking wedge products. Let S be the minimal globalization of the Harish-Chandra module of the complex Segal-Shale-Weil representation of the metaplectic group \tilde{G}. We prove that the associative commutant algebra \hbox{End}_{\tilde{G}}(\bigwedge^{\bullet}V^*\otimes S) of the metaplectic group \tilde{G} acting on the S-valued exterior forms is generated by certain representation of the super ortho-symplectic Lie algebra osp(1|2) and two distinguished operators. This establishes a Howe type duality between the metaplectic group and the super Lie algebra \mathfrak{osp}(1|2). Also the space \bigwedge^{\bullet}V^*\otimes S is decomposed wr. to the joint action of Mp(V,\omega) and osp(1|2).
