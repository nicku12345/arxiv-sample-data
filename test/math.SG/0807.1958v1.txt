A method of constructing of Darboux coordinates on a space that is a symplectic reduction with respect to a diagonal action of GL(m}) on a Cartesian product of N orbits of coadjoint representation of GL(m) is presented. The method gives an explicit symplectic birational isomorphism between the reduced space on the one hand and a Cartesian product of N-3 coadjoint orbits of dimension m(m-1) on an orbit of dimension (m-1)(m-2) on the other hand. In a generic case of the diagonalizable matrices it gives just the isomorphism that is birational and symplectic between some open, in a Zariski topology, domain of the reduced space and the Cartesian product of the orbits in question. The method is based on a Gauss decomposition of a matrix on a product of upper-triangular, lower-triangular and diagonal matrices. It works uniformly for the orbits formed by diagonalizable or not-diagonalizable matrices. It is elaborated for the orbits of maximal dimension that is m(m-1).
