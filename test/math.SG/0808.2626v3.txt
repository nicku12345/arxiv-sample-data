We compute, with Symplectic Field Theory techniques, the Gromov-Witten theory of the complex projective line with orbifold points. A natural subclass of these orbifolds, the ones with polynomial quantum cohomology, gives rise to a family of (polynomial) Frobenius manifolds and integrable systems of Hamiltonian PDEs, which extend the (dispersionless) bigraded Toda hierarchy. We then define a Frobenius structure on the spaces of polynomials in three complex variables of the form F(x,y,z)= -xyz+P_1(x)+P_2(y)+P_3(z) which contains as special cases the ones constructed on the space of Laurent polynomials. We prove a mirror theorem stating that these Frobenius structures are isomorphic to the ones found before for polynomial P1-orbifolds. Finally we link rational Symplectic Field Theory of Seifert fibrations over S^2 and three singular fibers with orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of the base, extending a known result valid in the smooth case.
