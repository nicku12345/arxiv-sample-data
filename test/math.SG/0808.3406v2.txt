We show how the relation between Poisson brackets and symplectic forms can be extended to the case of inhomogeneous multivector fields and inhomogeneous differential forms (or pseudodifferential forms). In particular we arrive at a notion which is a generalization of a symplectic structure and gives rise to higher Poisson brackets. We also obtain a construction of Koszul type brackets in this setting.
