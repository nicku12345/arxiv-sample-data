This is a continuation of our study of the foundations of D-branes from the viewpoint of Grothendieck in the region of the related Wilson's theory-space where "branes" are still branes. In this work, we focus on D-strings and construct the moduli stack of morphisms from Azumaya prestable curves C^{Az} with a fundamental module {\cal E} to a fixed target Y of a given combinatorial type. Such a morphism gives a prototype for a Wick-rotated D-string of B-type on Y, following the Polchinski-Grothendieck Ansatz, and this stack serves as a ground toward a mathematical theory of topological D-string world-sheet instantons.
