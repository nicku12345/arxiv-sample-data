We construct a new symplectic, bi-hamiltonian realization of the KM-system by reducing the corresponding one for the Toda lattice. The bi-hamiltonian pair is constructed using a reduction theorem of Fernandes and Vanhaecke. In this paper we also review the important work of Moser on the Toda and KM-systems.
