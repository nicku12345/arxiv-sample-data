We define the notion of fast finite-energy planes in the symplectization of a closed 3-dimensional energy level M of contact type. We use them to construct special open book decompositions of M when the contact structure is tight and induced by a (non-degenerate) dynamically convex contact form. The obtained open books have disk-like pages that are global surfaces of section for the Hamiltonian dynamics. Let S \subset \R^4 be the boundary of a smooth, strictly convex, non-degenerate and bounded domain. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a closed Hamiltonian orbit P\subset S to be the boundary of a disk-like global surface of section for the Hamiltonian dynamics is that P is unknotted and has self-linking number -1.
