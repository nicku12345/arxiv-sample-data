In this continuation of [L-Y1] and [L-L-S-Y], we explain how the Azumaya structure on D-branes together with a netted categorical quotient construction produces the same resolution of ADE orbifold singularities as that arises as the vacuum manifold/variety of the supersymmetric quantum field theory on the D-brane probe world-volume, given by Douglas and Moore [D-M] under the string-theory contents and constructed earlier through hyper-K\"{a}hler quotients by Kronheimer and Nakajima. This is consistent with the moral behind this project that Azumaya-type structure on D-branes themselves -- stated as the Polchinski-Grothendieck Ansatz in [L-Y1] -- gives a mathematical reason for many originally-open-string-induced properties of D-branes.
