H-holomorphic maps are a parameter version of J-holomorphic maps into contact manifolds. They have arisen in efforts to prove the existence of higher--genus holomorphic open book decompositions and efforts to prove the existence of finite energy foliations and the Weinstein conjecture, as well as in folded holomorphic maps. For all these applications it is essential to understand the compactness properties of the space of H-holomorphic maps.   We prove that the space of H-holomorphic maps with bounded periods into a manifold with stable Hamiltonian structure possesses a natural compactification. Limits of smooth maps are "neck-nodal maps", i.e. their domains can be pictured as nodal domains where the node is replaced by a finite cylinder that converges to a twisted cylinder over a closed characteristic or a finite length characteristic flow line. We show by examples that compactness fails without the condition on the periods, and we give topological conditions that ensure compactness.
