It is shown that if the universal cover of a manifold M is an open manifold, then two different fibres of the spherical cotangent bundle ST^*M cannot be connected by a non-negative Legendrian isotopy. This result is applied to the study of causality in globally hyperbolic spacetimes. It is also used to strengthen a result of Eliashberg, Kim, and Polterovich on the existence of a partial order on \widetilde{\mathrm{Cont}}_0 (ST^*M).
