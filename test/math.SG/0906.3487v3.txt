This paper begins the study of relations between Riemannian geometry and global properties of contact structures on 3-manifolds. In particular we prove an analog of the sphere theorem from Riemannian geometry in the setting of contact geometry. Specifically, if a given three dimensional contact manifold (M,\xi) admits a complete compatible Riemannian metric of positive 4/9-pinched curvature then the underlying contact structure \xi is tight; in particular, the contact structure pulled back to the universal cover is the standard contact structure on S^3. We also describe geometric conditions in dimension three for \xi to be universally tight in the nonpositive curvature setting.
