Let M^{2n} be a symplectic toric manifold with a fixed T^n-action and with a toric K\"ahler metric g. Abreu asked whether the spectrum of the Laplace operator \Delta_g on \mathcal{C}^\infty(M) determines the moment polytope of M, and hence by Delzant's theorem determines M up to symplectomorphism. We report on some progress made on an equivariant version of this conjecture. If the moment polygon of M^4 is generic and does not have too many pairs of parallel sides, the so-called equivariant spectrum of M and the spectrum of its associated real manifold M_R determine its polygon, up to translation and a small number of choices. For M of arbitrary even dimension and with integer cohomology class, the equivariant spectrum of the Laplacian acting on sections of a naturally associated line bundle determines the moment polytope of M.
