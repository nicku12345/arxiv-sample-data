Quantum integrable systems and their classical counterparts are considered. We show that the symplectic structure and invariant tori of the classical system can be deformed by a quantization parameter \hbar to produce a new (classical) integrable system. The new tori selected by the \hbar-equidistance rule represent the spectrum of the quantum system up to O(\hbar^\infty) and are invariant under quantum dynamics in the long-time range O(\hbar^{-\infty}). The quantum diffusion over the deformed tori is described. The analytic apparatus uses quantum action-angle coordinates explicitly constructed by an \hbar-deformation of the classical action-angles.
