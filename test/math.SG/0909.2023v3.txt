Suppose that (M,E) is a compact contact manifold, and that a compact Lie group G acts on M transverse to the contact distribution E. In an earlier paper, we defined a G-transversally elliptic Dirac operator \dirac, constructed using a Hermitian metric h and connection \nabla on the symplectic vector bundle E\rightarrow M, whose equivariant index is well-defined as a generalized function on G, and gave a formula for its index. By analogy with the geometric quantization of symplectic manifolds, the \mathbb{Z}_2-graded Hilbert space Q(M)=\ker \dirac \oplus \ker \dirac^{*} can be interpreted as the "quantization" of the contact manifold (M,E); the character of the corresponding virtual G-representation is then given by the equivariant index of \dirac. By defining contact analogues of the algebra of observables, pre-quantum line bundle and polarization, we further extend the analogy by giving a contact version of the Kostant-Souriau approach to quantization, and discussing the extent to which this approach is reproduced by the index-theoretic method.
