We use Bott periodicity to relate previously defined quantum classes to certain "exotic Chern classes" on BU. This provides an interesting computational and theoretical framework for some Gromov-Witten invariants connected with cohomological field theories. This framework has applications to study of higher dimensional, Hamiltonian rigidity aspects of Hofer geometry of  \mathbb{CP} ^{n}, one of which we discuss here.
