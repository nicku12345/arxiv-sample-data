In this article we study Ammann tilings from the perspective of symplectic geometry. Ammann tilings are nonperiodic tilings that are related to quasicrystals with icosahedral symmetry. We associate to each Ammann tiling two explicitly constructed highly singular symplectic spaces and we show that they are diffeomorphic but not symplectomorphic. These spaces inherit from the tiling its very interesting symmetries.
