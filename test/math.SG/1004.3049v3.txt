We present a method for finding embedded nullhomologous tori in standard 4-manifolds which can be utilized to change their smooth structure. As an application, we show how to obtain infinite families of simply connected smooth 4-manifolds with b^+ = 1 and b^- = 2,...,7, via surgery on nullhomologous tori embedded in the standard manifolds CP^2 # k (-CP^2), k=2,...,7.
