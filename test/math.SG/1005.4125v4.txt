We study the moduli space of twisted quasimaps from a fixed smooth projective curve to a Nakajima's quiver variety and the moduli space of \delta-stable framed twisted quiver bundles with moment map relations. We show that they carry symmetric obstruction theories and when \delta is large enough, they exactly coincide. These results generalize works of D.E. Diaconescu about the ADHM quiver, in the framework of the quasimap theory of I. Ciocan-Fontanine, D. Maulik and the author.
