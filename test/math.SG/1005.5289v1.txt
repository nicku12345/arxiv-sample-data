We associate a family of cluster X-varieties to the dual Poisson-Lie group G* of a complex semi-simple Lie group G of adjoint type given with the standard Poisson structure. This family is described by the W-permutohedron associated to the Lie algebra g of G: vertices being labeled by cluster X-varieties and edges by new Poisson birational isomorphisms, on appropriate seed X-tori, called saltation. The underlying combinatorics is based on a factorization of the Fomin-Zelevinsky twist maps into mutations and other new Poisson birational isomorphisms on seed X-tori called tropicalmutations, associated to an enrichment of the combinatorics on double words of the Weyl group W of G.
