We define the Global Centre Symmetry set (GCS) of a smooth closed m-dimensional submanifold M of R^n, n \leq 2m, which is an affinely invariant generalization of the centre of a k-sphere in R^{k+1}. The GCS includes both the centre symmetry set defined by Janeczko and the Wigner caustic defined by Berry. We develop a new method for studying generic singularities of the GCS which is suited to the case when M is lagrangian in R^{2m} with canonical symplectic form. The definition of the GCS, which slightly generalizes one by Giblin and Zakalyukin, is based on the notion of affine equidistants, so, we first study singularities of affine equidistants of Lagrangian submanifolds, classifying all the stable ones. Then, we classify the affine-Lagrangian stable singularities of the GCS of Lagrangian submanifolds and show that, already for smooth closed convex curves in R^2, many singularities of the GCS which are affine stable are not affine-Lagrangian stable.
