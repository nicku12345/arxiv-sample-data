Following the idea of Lusztig, Atiyah-Hirzebruch and Kosniowski, we note that the Dolbeault-type operators on compact, almost-complex manifolds are rigid. When the circle action has isolated fixed points, this rigidity result will produce many identities concerning the weights on the fixed points. In particular, it gives a criterion to detemine whether or not a symplectic circle action with isolated fixed points is Hamiltonian. As applications, we simplify the proofs of some known results related to symplectic circle actions, due to Godinho, Tolman-Weitsman and Pelayo-Tolman, and generalize some of them to more general cases.
