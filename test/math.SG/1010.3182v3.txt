In this paper we prove the existence of isomorphisms between certain non-commutative algebras that are interesting from representation theoretic perspective and arise as quantizations of certain Poisson algebras. We show that quantizations of Kleinian resolutions obtained by three different constructions are isomorphic to each other. The constructions are via symplectic reflection algebras, quantum Hamiltonian reduction, and W-algebras. Next, we prove that parabolic W-algebras in type A are isomorphic to quantum Hamiltonian reductions associated to quivers of type A. Finally, we show that the symplectic reflection algebras for wreath-products of the symmetric group and a Kleinian group are isomorphic to certain quantum Hamiltonian reductions. Our results involving W-algebras are new, while for those dealing with symplectic reflection algebras we just give new proofs. A key ingredient in our proofs is the study of quantizations of symplectic resolutions of appropriate Poisson varieties.
