We prove that for a sufficiently ample line bundle L on a surface S, the number of \delta-nodal curves in a general \delta-dimensional linear system is given by a universal polynomial of degree \delta in the four numbers L^2,\,L.K_S,\,K_S^2 and c_2(S).   The technique is a study of Hilbert schemes of points on curves on a surface, using the BPS calculus of [PT3] and the computation of tautological integrals on Hilbert schemes by Ellingsrud, G\"ottsche and Lehn.   We are also able to weaken the ampleness required, from G\"ottsche's (5\delta-1)-very ample to \delta-very ample.
