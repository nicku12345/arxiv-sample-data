We discuss generalizations of Ozsvath-Szabo's spectral sequence relating Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology, focusing attention on an explicit relationship between natural Z (resp., 1/2 Z) gradings appearing in the two theories. These two gradings have simple representation-theoretic (resp., geometric) interpretations, which we also review.
