This is a set of expository lecture notes created originally for a graduate course on holomorphic curves taught at ETH Zurich and the Humboldt University Berlin in 2009/2010. The notes are still incomplete, but due to recent requests from readers, I've decided to make a presentable half-finished version available here. Further chapters will be added in future updates.
