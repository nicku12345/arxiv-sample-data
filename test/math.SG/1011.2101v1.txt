We first construct the Rozansky-Witten model coupled to BF theory and Chern-Simons theory using the Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) method. Then we apply the machinery developed in some earlier papers about AKSZ theories and characteristic classes to these concrete models: the BF-Rozansky-Witten model and the Chern-Simons-Rozansky-Witten model. In the former case, we obtain characteristic classes on the target hyperKahler manifold equipped with a group action as a generalization of the original Rozansky-Witten classes. We also give the prescription for similar classes associated with a holomorphic symplectic manifold and demonstrate the invariance of such classes explicitly.
