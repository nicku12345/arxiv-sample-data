We consider the problem of motion of the heavy gyrostat in the case of Kowalevski-Yehia. To classify the bifurcation diagrams on iso-energetic levels we establish the existence of motion conditions in terms of parameters on the bifurcation surfaces. Obtaining these conditions in the form of explicit inequalities we build the separating set in the "energy-gyrostatic momentum" plane. Thus the electronic atlas of iso-energetic diagrams is created.
