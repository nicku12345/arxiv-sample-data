I begin by giving a general discussion of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems in the setting of contact geometry. We then pass to the particular case of toric contact structures on the manifold S^2\times S^3. In particular we give a complete solution to the contact equivalence problem for a class of toric contact structures, Y^{p,q}, discovered by physicists by showing that Y^{p,q} and Y^{p',q'} are inequivalent as contact structures if and only if p\neq p'.
