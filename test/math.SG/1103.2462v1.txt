Given a ribbon graph \Gamma with some extra structure, we define, using constructible sheaves, a dg category CPM(\Gamma) meant to model the Fukaya category of a Riemann surface in the cell of Teichm\"uller space described by \Gamma. When \Gamma is appropriately decorated and admits a combinatorial "torus fibration with section," we construct from \Gamma a one-dimensional algebraic stack \widetilde{X}_\Gamma with toric components. We prove that our model is equivalent to Perf(\widetilde{X}_\Gamma), the dg category of perfect complexes on \widetilde{X}_\Gamma.
