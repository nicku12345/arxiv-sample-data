One (actually, almost the only effective) way to prove formality of a differentiable manifold is to be able to produce a suitable derivation \delta such that d\delta-lemma holds. We first show that such derivation \delta generates a (1,1)-tensor field (we denote it by R). Then, we show that the supercommutation of d and \delta (which is a natural, essentially necessary condition to get a d\delta-lemma) is equivalent to vanishing of the Nijenhujis torsion of R. Then, we are looking for sufficient conditions that ensure the d\delta-lemma holds: we consider the cases when R is self adjoint with respect to a Riemannian metric or compatible with an almost symplectic structure. Finally, we show that if R is scew-symmetric with respect to a Riemannian metric, has constant determinant, and if its Nijenhujis torsion vanishes, then the orthogonal component of R in its polar decomposition is a complex structure compatible with the metric, which gives us a new characterization of K\"ahler structures
