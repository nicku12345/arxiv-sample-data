We study here some aspects of the topology of the space of smooth, stable, genus 0 curves in a Riemannian manifold X, i.e. the Kontsevich stable curves, which are not necessarily holomorphic. We use the Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder polyfold structure on this space and some natural characteristic classes, to show that for X=BU, the rational homology of the spherical mapping space injects into the rational homology of the space of stable curves. We also give here a definition of what we call q-complete symplectic manifolds, which roughly speaking means Gromov-Witten theory captures all information about homology of the space of smooth stable maps.
