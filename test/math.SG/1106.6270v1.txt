In this paper, we establish the convergence for Gromov-Witten invariant of elliptic orbifold \mathbb{P}^1 with type (3,3,3), (4,4,2) and (6,3,2). We also prove the mirror theorems of Gromov-Witten theory for those orbifolds and FJRW theory of elliptic singularities. Using T.Milanov and Y. Ruan's work, we prove the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence of all genera for the above three types of elliptic orbifold \mathbb{P}^1.
