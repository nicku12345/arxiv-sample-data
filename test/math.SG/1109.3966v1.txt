Associated to every generalized complex structure is a differential Gerstenhaber algebra (DGA). When the generalized complex structure deforms, so does the associated DGA. In this paper, we identify the infinitesimal conditions when the DGA is invariant as the generalized complex structure deforms. We prove that the infinitesimal condition is always integrable. When the underlying manifold is a holomorphic Poisson nilmanifolds, or simply a group in the general, and the geometry is invariant, we find a general construction to solve the infinitesimal conditions under some geometric conditions. Examples and counterexamples of existence of solutions to the infinitesimal conditions are given.
