We provide non trivial examples of solutions to the system of coupled equations introduced by M. Garc\'ia-Fern\'andez for the uniformization problem of a triple (M,L,E) where E is a holomorphic vector bundle over a polarized complex manifold (M,L), generalizing the notions of both constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric and Hermitian-Einstein metric.
