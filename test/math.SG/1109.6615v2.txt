Let X_n be a cycle of n projective lines, and \bT_n a symplectic torus with n punctures. Using the theory of spherical twists introduced by Seidel and Thomas (2001), I will define an action of the pure mapping class group of \bT_n on D^b(Coh(X_n)). The motivation comes from homological mirror symmetry for degenerate elliptic curves, which was studied by the author with Treumann and Zaslow in arXiv:1103.2462 .
