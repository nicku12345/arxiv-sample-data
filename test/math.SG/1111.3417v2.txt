We show how certain stabilizations produce infinitely many closed oriented 4-manifolds which are the total spaces of genus g surface bundles (resp. Lefschetz fibrations) over genus h surfaces and have non-zero signature, but do not admit complex structures with either orientations, for "most" (resp. all) possible values of g at least 3 and h at least 2 (resp. g at least 2 and h non-negative).
