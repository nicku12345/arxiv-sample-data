We reformulate the notion of a Jacobi algebroid in terms of weighted odd Jacobi brackets. We then show how a Jacobi algebroid can be understood in terms of a kind of curved Q-manifold. In particular the homological condition on the odd vector field is deformed in a very specific way. This leads to the notion of a quasi Q-manifold.
