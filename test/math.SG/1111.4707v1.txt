Based on examples from superstring/D-brane theory since the work of Douglas and Moore on resolution of singularities of a superstring target-space Y via a D-brane probe, the richness and the complexity of the stack of punctual D0-branes on a variety, and as a guiding question, we lay down a conjecture that any resolution Y^{\prime}\rightarrow Y of a variety Y over {\Bbb C} can be factored through an embedding of Y^{\prime} into the stack {\frak M}^{0^{A z^f}_{\;p}}_r (Y) of punctual D0-branes of rank r on Y for r\ge r_0 in {\Bbb N}, where r_0 depends on the germ of singularities of Y. We prove that this conjecture holds for the resolution \rho: C^{\prime}\rightarrow C of a reduced singular curve C over {\Bbb C}. In string-theoretical language, this says that the resolution C^{\prime} of a singular curve C always arises from an appropriate D0-brane aggregation on C and that the rank of the Chan-Paton module of the D0-branes involved can be chosen to be arbitrarily large.
