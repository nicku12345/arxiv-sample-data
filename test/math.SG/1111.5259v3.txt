Let (L, h)\to (X, \omega) denote a polarized toric K\"ahler manifold. Fix a toric submanifold Y and denote by \hat{\rho}_{tk}:X\to \mathbb{R} the partial density function corresponding to the partial Bergman kernel projecting smooth sections of L^k onto holomorphic sections of L^k that vanish to order at least tk along Y, for fixed t>0 such that tk\in \mathbb{N}. We prove the existence of a distributional expansion of \hat{\rho}_{tk} as k\to \infty, including the identification of the coefficient of k^{n-1} as a distribution on X. This expansion is used to give a direct proof that if \omega has constant scalar curvature, then (X, L) must be slope semi-stable with respect to Y. Similar results are also obtained for more general partial density functions. These results have analogous applications to the study of toric K-stability of toric varieties.
