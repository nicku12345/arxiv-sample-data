These notes are based on lectures given at the school on Geometric and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory, in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, in 2009. We present a basic introduction to Dirac manifolds, recalling the original context in which they were defined, their main features, and briefly mentioning more recent developments.
