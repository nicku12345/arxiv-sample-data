We prove that Hitchin's generalized Kaehler structure on the moduli space of instantons over a compact, even generalized Kaehler four-manifold may be obtained by generalized Kaehler reduction, in analogy with the usual Kaehler case. The underlying reduction of Courant algebroids is a realization of Donaldson's \mu-map in degree three.
