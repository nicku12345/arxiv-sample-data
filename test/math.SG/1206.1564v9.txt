In this short note we show how Dubrovin's integrable hierarchies, defined using the Gromov-Witten theory of a closed symplectic manifold, generalizes to Hamiltonian Floer theory. In particular, we show how the required generalization of the PSS isomorphism, relating Gromov-Witten theory and Hamiltonian Floer theory, can be constructed in the framework of Eliashberg-Givental-Hofer's symplectic field theory.
