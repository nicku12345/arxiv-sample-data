Let D^2 be the open unit disc in the Euclidean plane and let G:= Diff(D2; area) be the group of smooth compactly supported area-preserving diffeomorphisms of D^2. We investigate the properties of G endowed with the autonomous metric. In particular, we construct a bi-Lipschitz homomorphism Z^k \rightarrow G of a finitely generated free abelian group of an arbitrary rank. We also show that the space of homogeneous quasi-morphisms vanishing on all autonomous diffeomorphisms in the above group is infinite dimensional.
