The approximability of a convex body is a number which measures the difficulty to approximate that body by polytopes. We prove that twice the approximability is equal to the volume entropy for a Hilbert geometry in dimension two end three and that in higher dimension it is a lower bound of the entropy.   As a corollary we solve the entropy upper bound conjecture in dimension three and give a new proof in dimension two from the one found in Berck-Bernig-Vernicos (arXiv:0810.1123v2, published).
