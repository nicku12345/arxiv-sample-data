We show that there exists a morphism between a group \Gamma^{\mathrm{alg}} introduced by G. Wilson and a quotient of the group of tame symplectic automorphisms of the path algebra of a quiver introduced by Bielawski and Pidstrygach. The latter is known to act transitively on the phase space \mathcal{C}_{n,2} of the Gibbons-Hermsen integrable system of rank 2, and we prove that the subgroup generated by the image of \Gamma^{\mathrm{alg}} together with a particular tame symplectic automorphism has the property that, for every pair of points of the regular and semisimple locus of \mathcal{C}_{n,2}, the subgroup contains an element sending the first point to the second.
