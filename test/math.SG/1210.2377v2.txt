We study Nakai-Moishezon type question and Donaldson's "tamed to compatible" question for almost complex structures on rational four manifolds. By extending Taubes' subvarieties--current--form technique to J-nef genus 0 classes, we give affirmative answers of these two questions for all tamed almost complex structures on S^2 bundles over S^2 as well as for many geometrically interesting tamed almost complex structures on other rational four manifolds, including the del Pezzo ones.
