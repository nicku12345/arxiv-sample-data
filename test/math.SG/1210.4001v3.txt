We prove that the length of the boundary of a J-holomorphic curve with Lagrangian boundary conditions is dominated by a constant times its area. The constant depends on the symplectic form, the almost complex structure, the Lagrangian boundary conditions and the genus. A similar result holds for the length of the real part of a real J-holomorphic curve. The infimum over J of the constant properly normalized gives an invariant of Lagrangian submanifolds. We calculate this invariant to be 2\pi for the Lagrangian submanifold \mathbb R P^n \subset \mathbb C P^n. We apply our result to prove compactness of moduli of J-holomorphic maps to non-compact target spaces that are asymptotically exact. In a different direction, our result implies the adic convergence of the superpotential.
