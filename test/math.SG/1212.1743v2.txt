For any finitely presentable group G, we show the existence of an isolated complex surface singularity link which admits infinitely many exotic Stein fillings such that the fundamental group of each filling is isomorphic to G. We also provide an infinite family of closed exotic smooth four-manifolds with the fundamental group G such that each member of the family admits a non-holomorphic Lefschetz fibration over the two-sphere.
