In [2], the first author constructed the first known examples of exotic minimal symplectic \CP#5\CPb and minimal symplectic 4-manifold that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to 3\CP#7\CPb. The construction in [2] uses Y. Matsumoto's genus two Lefschetz fibrations on M = \mathbb{T}^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{2} #4\CPb over \mathbb{S}^2 along with the fake symplectic \mathbb{S}^{2} \times \mathbb{S}^{2} construction given in [1]. The main goal in this paper is to generalize the construction in [2] using the higher genus versions of Matsumoto's fibration constructed by Mustafa Korkmaz and Yusuf Gurtas on M(k,n) = \Sigma_{k}\times \mathbb{S}^{2} #4n\CPb for any k \geq 2 and n = 1, and k \geq 1 and n \geq 2, respectively. Using our building blocks, we also construct symplectic 4-manifolds with the free group of rank s \geq 1 and various other finitely generated groups as the fundamental group.
