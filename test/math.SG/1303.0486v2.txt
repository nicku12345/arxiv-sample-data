We define pointwise partial differential relations for holomorphic discs. Given a relative homotopy class, a relation, and a generic almost complex structure we provide the moduli space of discs which have an injective point with the structure of a smooth manifold. Applications to the local behaviour are given and an adjunction inequality for singularities is derived. Moreover, we show that for a coordinate class of a monotone Lagrangian split torus generically the number of non-immersed holomorphic discs is even.
