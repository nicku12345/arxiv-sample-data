The moduli space of stable pairs on a local surface X=K_S is in general non-compact. The action of \mathbb{C}^* on the fibres of X induces an action on the moduli space and the stable pair invariants of X are defined by the virtual localization formula. We study the contribution to these invariants of stable pairs (scheme theoretically) supported in the zero section S \subset X. Sometimes there are no other contributions, e.g. when the curve class \beta is irreducible.   We relate these surface stable pair invariants to the Poincar\'e invariants of D\"urr-Kabanov-Okonek. The latter are equal to the Seiberg-Witten invariants of S by work of D\"urr-Kabanov-Okonek and Chang-Kiem. We give two applications of our result. (1) For irreducible curve classes the GW/PT correspondence for X = K_S implies Taubes' GW/SW correspondence for S. (2) When p_g(S) = 0, the difference of surface stable pair invariants in class \beta and K_S - \beta is a universal topological expression.
