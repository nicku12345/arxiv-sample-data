The aim of our article is the study of solution space of the symplectic twistor operator T_s in symplectic spin geometry on standard symplectic space ({\mathbb R}^{2n},\omega), which is the symplectic analogue of the twistor operator in (pseudo)Riemannian spin geometry. In particular, we observe a substantial difference between the case n=1 of real dimension 2 and the case of {\mathbb R}^{2n}, n>1. For n>1, the solution space of T_s is isomorphic to the Segal-Shale-Weil representation.
