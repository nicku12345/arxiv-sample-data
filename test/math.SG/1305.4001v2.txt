Applying logarithmic transformations along 2-tori, we construct a generalized complex structure J_n with n type changing luci for every n\geq 0 on genus 1-Lefschetz fibrations with a cusp neighborhood, which include elliptic surfaces with non-zero euler characteristic. Applying a technique of broken Lefschetz fibrations, we further obtain twisted generalized complex structures with arbitrary large numbers of connected components of type changing loci on the manifold which is obtained from a symplectic manifold by logarithmic transformations of multiplicity 0 on a symplectic 2-torus with trivial normal bundle. The connected sums (2m+1)S^2\times S^2 for m\geq 0, (2n-1)\C P^2# (10n-1)\ol{\C P^2} and S^1\times S^3 admit twisted generalized complex structures J_n with n type changing luci for arbitrary large n.
