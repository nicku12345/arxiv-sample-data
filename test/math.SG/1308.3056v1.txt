This paper deals with the local semiclassical asymptotics of a quantum evolution operator in the Berezin-Toeplitz scheme, when both time and phase space variables are subject to appropriate scalings in the neighborhood of the graph of the underlying classical dynamics. Global consequences are then drawn regarding the scaling asymptotics of the trace of the quantum evolution as a function of time.
