Consider the standard symplectic (\RR^{2n}, \omega_0), a point p\in\RR^{2n} and an immersed closed orientable hypersurface \Sigma\subset\RR^{2n}\minus\{p\}, all in general position. We study the following passage/tangency question: how many lines in \RR^{2n} pass through p and tangent to \Sigma parallel to the 1-dimensional characteristic distribution \ker\left(\omega_0\big|_{T\Sigma}\right)\subset T\Sigma of \omega_0. We count each such line with a certain sign, and present an explicit formula for their algebraic number. This number is invariant under regular homotopies in the class of a general position of the pair (p, \Sigma), but jumps (in a well-controlled way) when during a homotopy we pass a certain singular discriminant. It provides a low bound to the actual number of these isotropic lines.
