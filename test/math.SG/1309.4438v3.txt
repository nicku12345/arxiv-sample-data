We formulate a Crepant Resolution Correspondence for open Gromov-Witten invariants (OCRC) of toric Lagrangian branes inside Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds by encoding the open theories into sections of Givental's symplectic vector space. The correspondence can be phrased as the identification of these sections via a linear morphism of Givental spaces. We deduce from this a Bryan-Graber-type statement for disk invariants, which we extend to arbitrary topologies in the Hard Lefschetz case. Motivated by ideas of Iritani, Coates-Corti-Iritani-Tseng and Ruan, we furthermore propose 1) a general form of the morphism entering the OCRC, which arises from a geometric correspondence between equivariant K-groups, and 2) an all-genus version of the OCRC for Hard Lefschetz targets. We provide a complete proof of both statements in the case of minimal resolutions of threefold An singularities; as a necessary step of the proof we establish the all-genus closed Crepant Resolution Conjecture with descendents in its strongest form for this class of examples. Our methods rely on a new description of the quantum D-modules underlying the equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of this family of targets.
