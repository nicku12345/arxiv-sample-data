Short survey based on talk at the Poisson 2012 conference. The main aim is to describe and give some examples of wild character varieties (naturally generalising the character varieties of Riemann surfaces by allowing more complicated behaviour at the boundary), their Poisson/symplectic structures (generalising both the Atiyah-Bott approach and the quasi-Hamiltonian approach), and the wild mapping class groups.
