In this paper, we first give the regular point reduction and the two types of Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a regular controlled Hamiltonian (RCH) system with symmetry and momentum map on the generalization of a semidirect product Lie group. Next, as an application of the theoretical results, we consider the underwater vehicle with two internal rotors as a regular point reducible RCH system, in the cases of coincident and non-coincident centers of buoyancy and gravity, we derive precisely the geometric constraint conditions of the reduced symplectic form for the dynamical vector field of the regular point reducible controlled underwater vehicle-rotor system, that is, the two types of Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the reduced controlled underwater vehicle-rotor system by calculation in detail, respectively. These researches reveal the deeply internal relationships of the geometrical structures of phase spaces, the dynamical vector fields and controls of the system.
