We prove an exponential estimate for the asymptotics of Bergman kernels of a positive line bundle under hypotheses of bounded geometry. We give further Bergman kernel proofs of complex geometry results, such as separation of points, existence of local coordinates and holomorphic convexity by sections of positive line bundles.
