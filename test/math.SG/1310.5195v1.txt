In this Part II, D(10.2), of D(10), we take D(10.1) (arXiv:1302.2054 [math.AG]) as the foundation to define the notion of Z-semistable morphisms from general Azumaya nodal curves, of genus \ge 2, with a fundamental module to a projective Calabi-Yau 3-fold and show that the moduli stack of such Z-semistable morphisms of a fixed type is compact. This gives us a counter moduli stack to D-strings as the moduli stack of stable maps in Gromov-Witten theory to the fundamental string. It serves and prepares for us the basis toward a new invariant of Calabi-Yau 3-fold that captures soft-D-string world-sheet instanton numbers in superstring theory. This note is written hand-in-hand with D(10.1) and is to be read side-by-side with ibidem.
