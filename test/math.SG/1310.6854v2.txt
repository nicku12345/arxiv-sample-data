This paper has two parts. The first part is a review and extension of the methods of integration of Leibniz algebras into Lie racks, including as new feature a new way of integrating 2-cocycles (see Lemma 3.9).   In the second part, we use the local integration of a Leibniz algebra h using a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff type formula in order to deformation quantize its linear dual h^*. More precisely, we define a natural rack product on the set of exponential functions which extends to a rack action on C^{\infty}(h^*).
