Building on Seidel-Solomon's fundamental work, we define the notion of a \mathfrak{g}-equivariant Lagrangian brane in an exact symplectic manifold M where \mathfrak{g} \subset SH^1(M) is a sub-Lie algebra of the symplectic cohomology of M. When M is a (symplectic) mirror to an (algebraic) homogeneous space G/P, homological mirror symmetry predicts that there is an embedding of \mathfrak{g} in SH^1(M). This allows us to study a mirror theory to classical constructions of Borel-Weil and Bott. We give explicit computations recovering all finite dimensional irreducible representations of \mathfrak{sl}_2 as representations on the Floer cohomology of an \mathfrak{sl}_2-equivariant Lagrangian brane and discuss generalizations to arbitrary finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras.
