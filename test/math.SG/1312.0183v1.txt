A notion of orthogonality in multisymplectic geometry has been developed by Cantrijn, Ibort and de Le\'on and used by many authors. In this paper, we review this concept and propose a new type of orthogonality in multisymplectic geometry; we prove a number of results regarding this orthogonality and its associated subspaces. We end by calculating the various subspaces of a G_2-vector space based on both types of orthogonality.
