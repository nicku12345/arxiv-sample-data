Consider a Laurent polynomial with real positive coefficients such that the origin is strictly inside its Newton polytope. Then it is strongly convex as a function of real positive argument. So it has a distinguished Morse critical point --- the unique critical point with real positive coordinates.   As a consequence we obtain a positive answer to a question of Ostrover and Tyomkin: the quantum cohomology algebra of a toric Fano manifold contains a field as a direct summand. Moreover, it gives a good evidence that the same statement holds for any Fano manifold.
