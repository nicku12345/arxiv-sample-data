The Milnor fibre of any isolated hypersurface singularity contains many exact Lagrangian spheres: the vanishing cycles associated to a Morsification of the singularity. Moreover, for simple singularities, it is known that the only possible exact Lagrangians are spheres. We construct exact Lagrangian tori in the Milnor fibres of all non-simple singularities of real dimension four. This gives examples of Milnor fibres whose Fukaya categories are not generated by vanishing cycles. Also, this allows progress towards mirror symmetry for unimodal singularities, which are one level of complexity up from the simple ones.
