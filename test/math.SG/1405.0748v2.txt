Around mid-1970s W. M. Tulczyjew discovered an approach which brings the two formalisms under a common geometric roof: the dynamics of a particle with configuration space X is determined by a Lagrangian submanifold D of TT^*X (the total tangent space of T^*X), and the description of D by its Hamiltonian H: T^*X\to \mathbb R (resp. its Lagrangian L: TX\to\mathbb R) yields the Hamilton (resp. Euler-Lagrange) equation.   It is reported here that Tulczyjew's approach also works for the dynamics of (charged) particles in gauge fields, in which the role of the total cotangent space T^*X is played by Sternberg phase spaces. In particular, it is shown that, for a particle in a gauge field, the equation of motion can be locally presented as the Euler-Lagrange equation for a Lagrangian which is the sum of the ordinary Lagrangian L(q, \dot q), the Lorentz term, and an extra new term which vanishes whenever the gauge group is abelian. A charge quantization condition is also derived, generalizing Dirac's charge quantization condition from \mathrm{U}(1) gauge group to any compact connected gauge group.
