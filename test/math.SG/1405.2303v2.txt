For a Liouville domain W satisfying c_1(W)=0, we propose in this note two versions of symplectic Tate homology \underrightarrow{H}\underleftarrow{T}(W) and \underleftarrow{H}\underrightarrow{T}(W) which are related by a canonical map \kappa \colon \underrightarrow{H}\underleftarrow{T}(W) \to \underleftarrow{H}\underrightarrow{T}(W). Our geometric approach to Tate homology uses the moduli space of finite energy gradient flow lines of the Rabinowitz action functional for a circle in the complex plane as a classifying space for S^1-equivariant Tate homology. For rational coefficients the symplectic Tate homology \underrightarrow{H}\underleftarrow{T}(W) has the fixed point property and is therefore isomorphic to H(W;\mathbb{Q}) \otimes \mathrm{Q}[u,u^{-1}], where \mathbb{Q}[u,u^{-1}] is the ring of Laurent polynomials over the rationals. Using a deep theorem of Goodwillie, we construct examples of Liouville domains where the canonical map \kappa is not surjective and examples where it is not injective.
