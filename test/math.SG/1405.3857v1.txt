We show that the big quantum cohomology of the symplectic isotropic Grassmanian IG(2,6) is generically semisimple, whereas its small quantum cohomology is known to be non-semisimple. This gives yet another case where Dubrovin's conjecture holds and stresses the need to consider the big quantum cohomology in its formulation.
