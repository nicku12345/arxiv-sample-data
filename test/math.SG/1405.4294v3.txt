We investigate the number of geodesics between two points p and q on a contact sub-Riemannian manifold M. We show that the count of geodesics on M is controlled by the count on its nilpotent approximation at p (a contact Carnot group). For contact Carnot groups we make the count explicit in exponential coordinates (x,z) \in \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times \mathbb{R} centered at p. In this case we prove that for the generic q the number of geodesics \nu(q) between p and q=(x,z) satisfies: \[ C_1\frac{|z|}{\|x\|^2} + R_1 \leq \nu(q) \leq C_2\frac{|z|}{\|x\|^2} + R_2\] for some constants C_1,C_2 and R_1,R_2. We recover exact values for Heisenberg groups, where C_1=C_2 = \frac{8}{\pi}.   Removing the genericity condition for q, geodesics might appear in families and we prove a similar statement for their topology. We study these families, and in particular we focus on the unexpected appearance of isometrically non-equivalent geodesics: families on which the action of isometries is not transitive.   We apply the previous study to contact sub-Riemannian manifolds: we prove that for any given point p \in M there is a sequence of points p_n such that p_n \to p and that the number of geodesics between p and p_n grows unbounded (moreover these geodesics have the property of being contained in a small neighborhood of p).
