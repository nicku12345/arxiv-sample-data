We construct new families of non-hyperelliptic Lefschetz fibrations by applying the daisy substitutions to the families of words (c_1c_2 \cdots c_{2g-1}c_{2g}{c_{2g+1}}^2c_{2g}c_{2g-1} \cdots c_2c_1)^2 = 1, (c_1c_2 \cdots c_{2g}c_{2g+1})^{2g+2} = 1, and (c_1c_2 \cdots c_{2g-1}c_{2g})^{2(2g+1)} = 1 in the mapping class group \Gamma_{g} of the closed orientable surface of genus g, and study the sections of these Lefschetz fibrations. Furthemore, we show that the total spaces of some of these Lefschetz fibraions are irreducible exotic 4-manifolds, and compute their Seiberg-Witten invariants. By applying the knot surgery to the family of Lefschetz fibrations obtained from the word (c_1c_2 \cdots c_{2g}c_{2g+1})^{2g+2} = 1 via daisy substitutions, we also construct an infinite family of pairwise non-diffeomorphic irreducible symplectic and non-symplectic 4-manifolds homeomorphic to (g^2 - g + 1){\mathbb{CP}}{}^{2} \# (3g^{2} - g(k-3) + 2k + 3)\overline{\mathbb{CP}}{}^{2} for any g \geq 3, and k = 2, \cdots, g+1.
