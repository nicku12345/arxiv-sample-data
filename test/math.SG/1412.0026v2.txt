Standard statistical mechanics of conservative systems relies on the symplectic geometry of the phase space. This is exploited to derive Hamilton's equations, Liouville's theorem and to find the canonical invariant measure. In this work we analyze the statistical mechanics of a class of nonconservative systems stemming from contact geometry. In particular, we find out the generalized Hamilton's equations, Liouville's theorem and the microcanonical and canonical measures invariant under the contact flow. Remarkably, the latter measure has a power law density distribution with respect to the standard contact volume form. Finally, we argue on the several possible applications of our results.
