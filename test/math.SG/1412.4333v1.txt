Using geometric quantization, we represent curve operators in the TQFT of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev with jauge group SU_2 as Toeplitz operators with symbols corresponding to trace functions. As an application, we show that eigenvectors of these operators are concentrated near the level sets of these trace functions, and obtain asymptotic estimates of pairings of such eigenvectors. This yields an asymptotic for some matrix coefficients of the image of mapping classes by quantum representations.
