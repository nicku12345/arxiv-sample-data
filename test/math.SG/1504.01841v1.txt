We lay down an elementary yet fundamental lemma concerning a finite algebraicness property of a smooth map from an Azumaya/matrix manifold with a fundamental module to a smooth manifold. This gives us a starting point to build a synthetic (synonymously, C^{\infty}-algebraic) symplectic geometry and calibrated geometry that are both tailored to and guided by D-brane phenomena in string theory and along the line of our previous works D(11.1) (arXiv:1406.0929 [math.DG]) and D(11.2) (arXiv:1412.0771 [hep-th]).
