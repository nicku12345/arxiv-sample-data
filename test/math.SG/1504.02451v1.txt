We review topological properties of K\"ahler and symplectic manifolds, and of their odd-dimensional counterparts, coK\"ahler and cosymplectic manifolds. We focus on formality, Lefschetz property and parity of Betti numbers, also distinguishing the simply-connected case (in the K\"ahler/symplectic situation) and the b_1=1 case (in the coK\"ahler/cosymplectic situation).
