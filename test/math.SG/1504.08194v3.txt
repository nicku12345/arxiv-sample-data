Multisymplectic geometry admits an operation that has no counterpart in symplectic geometry, namely, taking the product of two multisymplectic manifolds endowed with the wedge product of the multisymplectic forms. We show that there is an L-infinity-embedding of the L-infinity-algebra of observables of the individual factors into the observables of the product, and that homotopy moment maps for the individual factors induce a homotopy moment map for the product. As a by-product, we associate to every multisymplectic form a curved L-infinity-algebra, whose curvature is the multisymplectic form itself.
