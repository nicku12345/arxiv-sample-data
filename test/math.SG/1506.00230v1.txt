In \cite{AP3, AHP}, the first author and his collaborators constructed the irreducible symplectic 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to (2n-1){\mathbb{CP}}^{2}\#(2n-1)\overline{\mathbb{CP}}^{2} for each integer n \geq 25, and the families of simply connected irreducible nonspin symplectic 4-manifolds with positive signature that are interesting with respect to the symplectic geography problem. In this paper, we improve the main results in \cite{AP3, AHP}. In particular, we construct (i) an infinitely many irreducible symplectic and non-symplectic 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to (2n-1){\mathbb{CP}^{2}}\#(2n-1)\overline{\mathbb{CP}}^{2} for each integer n \geq 12, and (ii) the families of simply connected irreducible nonspin symplectic 4-manifolds that have the smallest Euler characteristics among the all known simply connected 4-manifolds with positive signature and with more than one smooth structure. Our construction uses the complex surfaces of Hirzebruch and Bauer-Catanese on Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau line with c_1^2 = 9\chi_h = 45, along with the exotic symplectic 4-manifolds constructed in \cite{A4, AP1, ABBKP, AP2, AS}.
