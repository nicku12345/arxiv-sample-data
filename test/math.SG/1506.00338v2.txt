The multisymplectic formalism of field theories developed by many mathematicians over the last fifty years is extended in this work to deal with manifolds that have boundaries. In particular, we develop a multisymplectic framework for first order covariant Hamiltonian field theories on manifolds with boundaries. This work is a geometric fulfillment of Fock's characterization of field theories as it appears in recent work by Cattaneo, Mnev and Reshetikhin [Ca14]. This framework leads to a true geometric understanding of conventional choices for boundary conditions. For example, the boundary condition that the pull-back of the 1-form on the cotangent space of fields at the boundary vanish, i.e. \pi * \alpha = 0 , is shown to be a consequence of our finding that the boundary fields of the theory lie in the 0-level set of the moment map of the gauge group of the theory.   It is also shown that the natural way to interpret Euler-Lagrange equations as an evolution system near the boundary is as a presymplectic system in an extended phase space containing the natural configuration and momenta fields at the boundary together with extra degrees of freedom corresponding to the transversal components at the boundary of the momenta fields of the theory. The consistency conditions at the boundary are analyzed and the reduced phase space of the system is determined to be a symplectic manifold with a distinguished isotropic submanifold corresponding to the boundary data of the solutions of Euler-Lagrange equations. This setting makes it possible to define well-posed boundary conditions, and provides the adequate setting for the canonical quantization of the system.   The notions of the theory will be tested against three significant examples: scalar fields, Poisson\sigma-model and Yang-Mills theories.
