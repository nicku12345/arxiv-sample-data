We study the variational structure of the discrete Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (dKP) equation by means of its pluri-Lagrangian formulation. We consider the dKP equation and its variational formulation on the cubic lattice {\mathbb Z}^{N} as well as on the root lattice Q(A_{N}). We prove that, on a lattice of dimension at least four, the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are equivalent to the dKP equation.
