We develop a theory of curved A-infinity-categories around equivalences of their module categories. This allows for a uniform treatment of curved and uncurved A-infinity-categories which generalizes the classical theory of uncurved A-infinity algebras. Furthermore, the theory is sufficiently general to treat both Fukaya categories and categories of matrix factorizations, as well as to provide a context in which unitification and categorification of pre-categories can be carried out.   Our theory is built around two functors: the adjoint algebra functor U_e and the functor Q_*. The bulk of the paper is dedicated to proving crucial adjunction and homotopy theorems about these functors. In addition, we explore the non-vanishing of the module categories and give a precise statement and proof the result known as "Positselski-Kontsevich vanishing".
