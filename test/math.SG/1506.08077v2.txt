This article introduces the degenerate special Lagrangian equation (DSL) and develops the basic analytic tools to construct and study its solutions. The DSL governs geodesics in the space of positive graph Lagrangians in \mathbb{C}^n. Existence of geodesics in the space of positive Lagrangians is an important step in a program for proving existence and uniqueness of special Lagrangians. Moreover, it would imply certain cases of the strong Arnold conjecture from Hamiltonian dynamics.   We show the DSL is degenerate elliptic. We introduce a space-time Lagrangian angle for one-parameter families of graph Lagrangians, and construct its regularized lift. The superlevel sets of the regularized lift define subequations for the DSL in the sense of Harvey--Lawson. We extend the existence theory of Harvey--Lawson for subequations to the setting of domains with corners, and thus obtain solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the DSL in all branches. Moreover, we introduce the calibration measure, which plays a r\^ole similar to that of the Monge--Amp\`ere measure in convex and complex geometry. The existence of this measure and regularity estimates allow us to prove that the solutions we obtain in the outer branches of the DSL have a well-defined length in the space of positive Lagrangians.
