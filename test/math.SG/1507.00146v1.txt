In this note we classify invariant star products with quantum momentum maps on symplectic manifolds by means of an equivariant characteristic class taking values in the equivariant cohomology. We establish a bijection between the equivalence classes and the formal series in the second equivariant cohomology, thereby giving a refined classification which takes into account the quantum momentum map as well.
