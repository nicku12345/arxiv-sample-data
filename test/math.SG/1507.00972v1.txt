There is a well-established procedure of assigning a strong homotopy Lie algebra of local observables to a multisymplectic manifold which can be regarded as part of a categorified Poisson structure. For a 2-plectic manifold, the resulting Lie 2-algebra is isomorphic to a sub Lie 2-algebra of a natural Lie 2-algebra structure on an exact Courant algebroid. We generalize this statement to arbitrary n-plectic manifolds and study automorphisms on the arising Lie n-algebras. Our observations may be useful in studying the quantization problem on multisymplectic manifolds.
