Let G be a compact Lie group and \mathbf{k} be a field of characteristic p \geq 0 such that H^* (G) does not have p-torsion. We show that a free Lagrangian orbit of a Hamiltonian G-action on a compact, monotone, symplectic manifold X split-generates an idempotent summand of the monotone Fukaya category \mathcal{F}(X; \mathbf{k}) if and only if it represents a non-zero object of that summand (slightly more general results are also provided). Our result is based on: an explicit understanding of the wrapped Fukaya category \mathcal{W}(T^*G; \mathbf{k}) through Koszul twisted complexes involving the zero-section and a cotangent fibre; and a functor D^b \mathcal{W}(T^*G; \mathbf{k}) \to D^b\mathcal{F}(X^{-} \times X; \mathbf{k}) canonically associated to the Hamiltonian G-action on X. We explore several examples which can be studied in a uniform manner including toric Fano varieties and certain Grassmannians.
