A strict quantization of a compact symplectic manifold S on a subset I\subseteq\R, containing 0 as an accumulation point, is defined as a continuous field of C^*-algebras \{A_{\hbar}\}_{\hbar\in I}, with A_0=C_0(S), and a set of continuous cross-sections \{Q(f)\}_{f\in C^{\infty}(S)} for which Q_0(f)=f. Here Q_{\hbar}(f^*)=Q_{\hbar}(f)^* for all \hbar\in I, whereas for \hbar\to 0 one requires that i[Q_{\hbar}(f),Q_{\hbar}(g)]/\hbar\to Q_{\hbar}(\{f,g\}) in norm. We discuss general conditions which guarantee that a (deformation) quantization in a more physical sense leads to one in the above sense.   Using ideas of Berezin, Lieb, Simon, and others, we construct a strict quantization of an arbitrary integral coadjoint orbit O_{\lm} of a compact connected Lie group G, associated to a highest weight \lm. Here I=0\cup 1/\N, so that \hbar=1/k, k\in\N, and A_{1/k} is defined as the C^*-algebra of all matrices on the finite-dimensional Hilbert space V_{k\lm} carrying the irreducible representation U_{k\lm}(G) with highest weight k\lm. The quantization maps Q_{1/k}(f) are constructed from coherent states in V_{k\lm}, and have the special feature of being positive maps.
