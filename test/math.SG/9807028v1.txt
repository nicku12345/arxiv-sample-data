A nonzero 2-cocycle \Gamma\in Z^2(\g,\R) on the Lie algebra \g of a compact Lie group G defines a twisted version of the Lie-Poisson structure on the dual Lie algebra \g^*, leading to a Poisson algebra C^{\infty}(\g_{(\Gamma)}^*). Similarly, a multiplier c\in Z^2(G,U(1)) on G which is smooth near the identity defines a twist in the convolution product on G, encoded by the twisted group C^*-algebra C^*(G,c).   Further to some superficial yet enlightening analogies between C^{\infty}(\g^*_{(\Gamma)}) and C^*(G,c), it is shown that the latter is a strict quantization of the former, where Planck's constant \hbar assumes values in (\Z\backslash\{0\})^{-1}. This means that there exists a continuous field of C^*-algebras, indexed by \hbar\in 0\cup (\Z\backslash\{0\})^{-1}, for which \A^0=C_0(\g^*) and \A_{\hbar}=C^*(G,c) for \hbar\neq 0, along with a cross-section of the field satisfying Dirac's condition asymptotically relating the commutator in \A_{\hbar} to the Poisson bracket on C^{\infty}(\g^*_{(\Gamma)}). Note that the `quantization' of \hbar does not occur for \Gamma=0.
