We show that, given a certain transversality condition, the set of relative equilibria \mcl E near p_e\in\mcl E of a Hamiltonian system with symmetry is locally Whitney-stratified by the conjugacy classes of the isotropy subgroups (under the product of the coadjoint and adjoint actions) of the momentum-generator pairs (\mu,\xi) of the relative equilibria. The dimension of the stratum of the conjugacy class (K) is \dim G+2\dim Z(K)-\dim K, where Z(K) is the center of K, and transverse to this stratum \mcl E is locally diffeomorphic to the commuting pairs of the Lie algebra of K/Z(K). The stratum \mcl E_{(K)} is a symplectic submanifold of P near p_e\in\mcl E if and only if p_e is nondegenerate and K is a maximal torus of G. We also show that there is a dense subset of G-invariant Hamiltonians on P for which all the relative equilibria are transversal. Thus, generically, the types of singularities that can be found in the set of relative equilibria of a Hamiltonian system with symmetry are those types found amongst the singularities at zero of the sets of commuting pairs of certain Lie subalgebras of the symmetry group.
