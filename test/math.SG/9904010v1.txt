We classify Lie-Poisson brackets that are formed from Lie algebra extensions. The problem is relevant because many physical systems owe their Hamiltonian structure to such brackets. A classification involves reducing all brackets to a set of normal forms, and is achieved partially through the use of Lie algebra cohomology. For extensions of order less than five, the number of normal forms is small and they involve no free parameters. We derive a general method of finding Casimir invariants of Lie-Poisson bracket extensions. The Casimir invariants of all low-order brackets are explicitly computed. We treat in detail a four field model of compressible reduced magnetohydrodynamics.
