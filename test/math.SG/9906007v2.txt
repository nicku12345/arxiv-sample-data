We generalize the Weinstein-Moser theorem on the existence of nonlinear normal modes (i.e., periodic orbits) near an equilibrium in a Hamiltonian system to a theorem on the existence of relative periodic orbits near a relative equilibrium in a Hamiltonian system with continuous symmetries.   More specifically we significantly improve a result proved earlier jointly with Tokieda (math.SG/9901102): we remove a technical hypothesis which amounted to an assumption that the symmetry group is a torus.
