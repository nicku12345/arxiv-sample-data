We show that any degree at least g polynomial in descendant or tautological classes vanishes on M_{g,n} when g\ge 2. This generalizes a result of Looijenga and proves a version of Getzler's conjecture. The method we use is the study of the relative Gromov-Witten invariants of P^1 relative 2 points combined with the degeneration formulas of [IP1]. At the end of the paper, we also included a quick proof of a very recent conjecture made by Vakil.
