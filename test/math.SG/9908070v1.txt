The cobordism ring of symplectic manifolds defined by V.L. Ginzburg is shown to be isomorphic to the Pontrjagin ring of complex-oriented manifolds with free circle actions. This suggests an interpretation of the formal group law of complex cobordism, in terms of a composition-law on semiclassical expansions. An appendix discusses related questions about cobordism of toric varieties.
