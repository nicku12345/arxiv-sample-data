The system of four point vortices in the plane has relative equilibria that behave as composite particles, in the case where three of the vortices have strength -\Gamma/3 and one of the vortices has strength \Gamma. These relative equilibria occur at nongeneric momenta. The reduction of this system, at those momenta, by continuous and then discrete symmetries, classifies the 4-vortex states which have been observed as products of collisions of two such composite particles. In this article I explicitly calculate these reductions, and show they are qualitatively identical one degree of freedom systems on a cylinder. The flows on these reduced systems all have one stable equilibrium and one unstable equilibrium, and all the orbits are periodic except for two homoclinic connections to the unstable equilibrium.
