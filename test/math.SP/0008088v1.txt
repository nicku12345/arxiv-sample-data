For a domain \Omega contained in a hemisphere of the n-dimensional sphere \SS^n we prove the optimal result \lambda_2/\lambda_1(\Omega) \le \lambda_2/\lambda_1(\Omega^{\star}) for the ratio of its first two Dirichlet eigenvalues where \Omega^{\star}, the symmetric rearrangement of \Omega in \SS^n, is a geodesic ball in \SS^n having the same n-volume as \Omega. We also show that \lambda_2/\lambda_1 for geodesic balls of geodesic radius \theta_1 less than or equal to \pi/2 is an increasing function of \theta_1 which runs between the value (j_{n/2,1}/j_{n/2-1,1})^2 for \theta_1=0 (this is the Euclidean value) and 2(n+1)/n for \theta_1=\pi/2. Here j_{\nu,k} denotes the k^{th} positive zero of the Bessel function J_{\nu}(t). This result generalizes the Payne-P\'{o}lya-Weinberger conjecture, which applies to bounded domains in Euclidean space and which we had proved earlier. Our method makes use of symmetric rearrangement of functions and various technical properties of special functions. We also prove that among all domains contained in a hemisphere of \SS^n and having a fixed value of \lambda_1 the one with the maximal value of \lambda_2 is the geodesic ball of the appropriate radius. This is a stronger, but slightly less accessible, isoperimetric result than that for \lambda_2/\lambda_1. Various other results for \lambda_1 and \lambda_2 of geodesic balls in \SS^n are proved in the course of our work.
