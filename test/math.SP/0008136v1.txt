We define a class of pseudo-ergodic non-self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators acting in spaces l^2(X) and prove some general theorems about their spectral properties. We then apply these to study the spectrum of a non-self-adjoint Anderson model acting on l^2(\Z), and find the precise condition for 0 to lie in the spectrum of the operator. We also introduce the notion of localized spectrum for such operators.
