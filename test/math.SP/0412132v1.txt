The Dirichlet Laplacian in curved tubes of arbitrary cross-section rotating with respect to the Tang frame along infinite curves in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension is investigated. If the reference curve is not straight and its curvatures vanish at infinity, we prove that the essential spectrum as a set coincides with the spectrum of the straight tube of the same cross-section and that the discrete spectrum is not empty.
