A family of Friedrichs models under rank one perturbations h_{\mu}(p), p \in (-\pi,\pi]^3, \mu>0, associated to a system of two particles on the three dimensional lattice \Z^3 is considered. We prove the existence of a unique eigenvalue below the bottom of the essential spectrum of h_\mu(p) for all nontrivial values of p under the assumption that h_\mu(0) has either a threshold energy resonance (virtual level) or a threshold eigenvalue. The threshold energy expansion for the Fredholm determinant associated to a family of Friedrichs models is also obtained.
