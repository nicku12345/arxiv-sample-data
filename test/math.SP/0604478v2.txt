We use a classical result of Gollinski and Ibragimov to prove an analog of the strong Szego theorem for Jacobi matrices on l^2(\N). In particular, we consider the class of Jacobi matrices with conditionally summable parameter sequences and find necessary and sufficient conditions on the spectral measure such that \sum_{k=n}^\infty b_k and \sum_{k=n}^\infty (a_k^2 - 1) lie in l^2_1, the linearly-weighted l^2 space.
