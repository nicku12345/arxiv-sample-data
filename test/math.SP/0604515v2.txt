We use the classical results of Baxter and Gollinski-Ibragimov to prove a new spectral equivalence for Jacobi matrices on l^2(\N). In particular, we consider the class of Jacobi matrices with conditionally summable parameter sequences and find necessary and sufficient conditions on the spectral measure such that \sum_{k=n}^\infty b_k and \sum_{k=n}^\infty (a_k^2 - 1) lie in l^2_1 \cap l^1 or l^1_s for s \geq 1.
