Consider a homogenized spectral pencil of exactly solvable linear differential operators T_{\la}=\sum_{i=0}^k Q_{i}(z)\la^{k-i}\frac {d^i}{dz^i}, where each Q_{i}(z) is a polynomial of degree at most i and \la is the spectral parameter. We show that under mild nondegeneracy assumptions for all sufficiently large positive integers n there exist exactly k distinct values \la_{n,j}, 1\le j\le k, of the spectral parameter \la such that the operator T_{\la} has a polynomial eigenfunction p_{n,j}(z) of degree n. These eigenfunctions split into k different families according to the asymptotic behavior of their eigenvalues. We conjecture and prove sequential versions of three fundamental properties: the limits \Psi_{j}(z)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{p_{n,j}'(z)}{\la_{n,j}p_{n,j}(z)} exist, are analytic and satisfy the algebraic equation \sum_{i=0}^k Q_{i}(z) \Psi_{j}^i(z)=0 almost everywhere in \bCP. As a consequence we obtain a class of algebraic functions possessing a branch near \infty\in \bCP which is representable as the Cauchy transform of a compactly supported probability measure.
