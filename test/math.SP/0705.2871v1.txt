We consider a class of translationally invariant magnetic fields such that the corresponding potential has a constant direction.   Our goal is to study basic spectral properties of the Schr\"odinger operator {\bf H} with such a potential. In particular, we show that the spectrum of {\bf H} is absolutely continuous and we find its location. Then we study the long-time behaviour of solutions \exp(-i {\bf H} t)f of the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation. It turnes out that a quantum particle remains localized in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the potential. Its propagation in this direction is determined by group velocities. It is to a some extent similar to a evolution of a one-dimensional free particle but "exits" to +\infty and -\infty might be essentially different.
