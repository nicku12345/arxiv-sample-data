We explore the extent to which a variant of a celebrated formula due to Jost and Pais, which reduces the Fredholm perturbation determinant associated with the Schr\"odinger operator on a half-line to a simple Wronski determinant of appropriate distributional solutions of the underlying Schr\"odinger equation, generalizes to higher dimensions. In this multi-dimensional extension the half-line is replaced by an open set \Omega\subset\bbR^n, n\in\bbN, n\geq 2, where \Omega has a compact, nonempty boundary \partial\Omega satisfying certain regularity conditions. Our variant involves ratios of perturbation determinants corresponding to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on \partial\Omega and invokes the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. As a result, we succeed in reducing a certain ratio of modified Fredholm perturbation determinants associated with operators in L^2(\Omega; d^n x), n\in\bbN, to modified Fredholm determinants associated with operators in L^2(\partial\Omega; d^{n-1}\sigma), n\geq 2.   Applications involving the Birman-Schwinger principle and eigenvalue counting functions are discussed.
