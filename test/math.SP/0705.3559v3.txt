We describe the spectrum of the k-form Laplacian on conformally cusp Riemannian manifolds. The essential spectrum is shown to vanish precisely when the k and k-1 de Rham cohomology groups of the boundary vanish. We give Weyl-type asymptotics for the eigenvalue-counting function in the purely discrete case. In the other case we analyze the essential spectrum via positive commutator methods and establish a limiting absorption principle. This implies the absence of the singular spectrum for a wide class of metrics. We also exhibit a class of potentials V such that the Schr\"odinger operator has compact resolvent, although V tends to -\infty in most of the infinity. We correct a statement from the literature regarding the essential spectrum of the Laplacian on forms on hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume, and we propose a conjecture about the existence of such manifolds in dimension four whose cusps are rational homology spheres.
