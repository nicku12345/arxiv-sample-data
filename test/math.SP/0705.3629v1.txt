We study the Koplienko Spectral Shift Function (KoSSF), which is distinct from the one of Krein (KrSSF). KoSSF is defined for pairs A,B with (A-B)\in\calI_2, the Hilbert-Schmidt operators, while KrSSF is defined for pairs A,B with (A-B)\in\calI_1, the trace class operators. We review various aspects of the construction of both KoSSF and KrSSF. Among our new results are: (i) that any positive Riemann integrable function of compact support occurs as a KoSSF; (ii) that there exist A,B with (A-B)\in\calI_2 so \det_2((A-z)(B-z)^{-1}) does not have nontangential boundary values; (iii) an alternative definition of KoSSF in the unitary case; and (iv) a new proof of the invariance of the a.c. spectrum under \calI_1-perturbations that uses the KrSSF.
