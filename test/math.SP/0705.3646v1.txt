We consider C=A+B where A is selfadjoint with a gap (a,b) in its spectrum and B is (relatively) compact. We prove a general result allowing B of indefinite sign and apply it to obtain a (\delta V)^{d/2} bound for perturbations of suitable periodic Schrodinger operators and a (not quite)Lieb-Thirring bound for perturbations of algebro-geometric almost periodic Jacobi matrices.
