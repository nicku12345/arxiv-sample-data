We derive differential inequalities and difference inequalities for Riesz means of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian,   R_{\sigma}(z) := \sum_k{(z -\lambda_k)_+^{\sigma}}.   Here {\lambda_k}_{k=1}^{\infty} are the ordered eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a bounded domain \Omega \subset \R^d, and x_+ := \max(0, x) denotes the positive part of the quantity x. As corollaries of these inequalities, we derive Weyl-type bounds on \lambda_k, on averages such as \bar{\lambda_k} := {\frac 1 k}\sum_{\ell \le k}\lambda_\ell, and on the eigenvalue counting function. For example, we prove that for all domains and all k \ge j \frac{1+\frac d 2}{1+\frac d 4},   {\bar{\lambda_{k}}}/{\bar{\lambda_{j}}} \le 2 (\frac{1+\frac d 4}{1+\frac d 2})^{1+\frac 2 d}({\frac k j})^{\frac 2 d}.
