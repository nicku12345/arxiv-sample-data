We consider singularly perturbed second order elliptic system in the whole space with fast oscillating coefficients. We construct the complete asymptotic expansions for the eigenvalues converging to the isolated ones of the homogenized system, as well as the complete asymptotic expansions for the associated eigenfunctions.
