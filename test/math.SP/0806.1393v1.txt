For general non-symmetric operators A, we prove that the moment of order \gamma \ge 1 of negative real-parts of its eigenvalues is bounded by the moment of order \gamma of negative eigenvalues of its symmetric part H = {1/2} [A + A^*]. As an application, we obtain Lieb-Thirring estimates for non self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators. In particular, we recover recent results by Frank, Laptev, Lieb and Seiringer \cite{FLLS}. We also discuss moment of resonances of Schr\"odinger self-adjoint operators.
