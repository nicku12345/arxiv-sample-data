We consider the pseudodifferential operators H_{m,\Omega} associated by the prescriptions of quantum mechanics to the Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian \sqrt{|{\bf P}|^2+m^2} when restricted to a compact domain \Omega in {\mathbb R}^d. When the mass m is 0 the operator H_{0,\Omega} coincides with the generator of the Cauchy stochastic process with a killing condition on \partial \Omega. (The operator H_{0,\Omega} is sometimes called the {\it fractional Laplacian} with power 1/2, cf. \cite{Gie}.) We prove several universal inequalities for the eigenvalues 0 < \beta_1 < \beta_2 \le >... of H_{m,\Omega} and their means \overline{\beta_k} := \frac{1}{k} \sum_{\ell=1}^k{\beta_\ell}.   Among the inequalities proved are: {\overline{\beta_k}} \ge {\rm cst.} (\frac{k}{|\Omega|})^{1/d} for an explicit, optimal "semiclassical" constant, and, for any dimension d \ge 2 and any k: \beta_{k+1} \le \frac{d+1}{d-1} \overline{\beta_k}. Furthermore, when d \ge 2 and k \ge 2j, \frac{\overline{\beta}_{k}}{\overline{\beta}_{j}} \leq \frac{d}{2^{1/d}(d-1)}(\frac{k}{j})^{\frac{1}{d}}.   Finally, we present some analogous estimates allowing for an external potential energy field, i.e, H_{m,\Omega}+ V(\bf x), for V(\bf x) in certain function classes.
