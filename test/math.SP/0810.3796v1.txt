By making use of some techniques based upon certain inverse new pairs of symbolic operators, the author investigate several decomposition formulas associated with Humbert hypergeometric functions \Phi_1 , \Phi_2 , \Phi_3 , \Psi_1 , \Psi_2 , \Xi_1  and \Xi_2 . These operational representations are constructed and applied in order to derive the corresponding decomposition formulas. With the help of these inverse pairs of symbolic operators, a total 34 decomposition formulas are found. Euler type integrals, which are connected with Humbert's functions are found.
