We study self-adjoint bounded Jacobi operators of the form:   (J \psi)(n) = a_n \psi(n + 1) + b_n \psi(n) +a_{n-1} \psi(n - 1) on \ell^2(\N). We assume that for some fixed q, the q-variation of \{a_n\} and \{b_n\} is square-summable and \{a_n\} and \{b_n\} converge to q-periodic sequences. Our main result is that under these assumptions the essential support of the absolutely continuous part of the spectrum of J is equal to that of the asymptotic periodic Jacobi operator. This work is an extension of a recent result of S.A.Denisov.
