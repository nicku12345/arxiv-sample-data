In the first part of the paper we consider the Schr\"odinger operator  -\Delta-V(x),\quad V>0.  We discuss the relation between the behavior of V at the infinity and the properties of the negative spectrum of H. After that, we consider the case when V changes its sign:  V=V_+-V_-, 2V_\pm=|V|\pm V.  In this case, we treat V and -V symmetrically and study the relation between the behavior of V at the infinity and the negative spectra of the operators H_+=-\Delta+V and H_-=-\Delta-V.
