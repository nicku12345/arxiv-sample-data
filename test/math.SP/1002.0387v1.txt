We prove local and global versions of Borg-Marchenko-type uniqueness theorems for half-lattice and full-lattice CMV operators (CMV for Cantero, Moral, and Velazquez) with matrix-valued Verblunsky coefficients. While our half-lattice results are formulated in terms of matrix-valued Weyl-Titchmarsh functions, our full-lattice results involve the diagonal and main off-diagonal Green's matrices.   We also develop the basics of Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for CMV operators with matrix-valued Verblunsky coefficients as this is of independent interest and an essential ingredient in proving the corresponding Borg-Marchenko-type uniqueness theorems.
