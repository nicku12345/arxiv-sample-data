We consider Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps associated with (not necessarily self-adjoint) Schrodinger operators in L^2(\Omega; d^n x), n=2,3, where \Omega is an open set with a compact, nonempty boundary satisfying certain regularity conditions. As an application we describe a reduction of a certain ratio of modified Fredholm perturbation determinants associated with operators in L^2(\Omega; d^n x) to modified Fredholm perturbation determinants associated with operators in L^2(\partial\Omega; d^{n-1}\sigma), n=2,3. This leads to a two- and three-dimensional extension of a variant of a celebrated formula due to Jost and Pais, which reduces the Fredholm perturbation determinant associated with a Schrodinger operator on the half-line (0,\infty) to a simple Wronski determinant of appropriate distributional solutions of the underlying Schrodinger equation.
