We consider Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps associated with (not necessarily self-adjoint) Schrodinger operators describing nonlocal interactions in L^2(\Omega; d^n x), n\geq 2, where \Omega is an open set with a compact, nonempty boundary satisfying certain regularity conditions. As an application we describe a reduction of a certain ratio of Fredholm perturbation determinants associated with operators in L^2(\Omega; d^n x) to Fredholm perturbation determinants associated with operators in L^2(\partial\Omega; d^{n-1}\sigma). This leads to an extension of a variant of a celebrated formula due to Jost and Pais, which reduces the Fredholm perturbation determinant associated with a Schr\"odinger operator on the half-line (0,\infty), in the case of local interactions, to a Wronski determinant of appropriate distributional solutions of the underlying Schrodinger equation.
