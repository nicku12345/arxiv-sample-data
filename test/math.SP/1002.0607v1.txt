Relations between half- and full-lattice CMV operators with scalar- and matrix-valued Verblunsky coefficients are investigated. In particular, the decoupling of full-lattice CMV operators into a direct sum of two half-lattice CMV operators by a perturbation of minimal rank is studied. Contrary to the Jacobi case, decoupling a full-lattice CMV matrix by changing one of the Verblunsky coefficients results in a perturbation of twice the minimal rank. The explicit form for the minimal rank perturbation and the resulting two half-lattice CMV matrices are obtained. In addition, formulas relating the Weyl--Titchmarsh m-functions (resp., matrices) associated with the involved CMV operators and their Green's functions (resp., matrices) are derived.
