We study the eigenvalue problem -u"+V(z)u=\lambda u in the complex plane with the boundary condition that u(z) decays to zero as z tends to infinity along the two rays \arg z=-\frac{\pi}{2} \pm \frac{2\pi}{m+2}, where V(z)=-(iz)^m-P(iz) for complex-valued polynomials P of degree at most m-1\geq 2. We provide an asymptotic formula for eigenvalues and a necessary and sufficient condition for the anharmonic oscillator to have infinitely many real eigenvalues.
