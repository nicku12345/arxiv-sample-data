The Anderson Hamiltonian H_0=-\Delta+V(x,\omega) is considered, where V is a random potential of Bernoulli type. The operator H_0 is perturbed by a non-random, continuous potential -w(x) \leq 0, decaying at infinity. It will be shown that the borderline between finitely, and infinitely many negative eigenvalues of the perturbed operator, is achieved with a decay of the potential -w(x) as O(\ln^{-2/d} |x|).
