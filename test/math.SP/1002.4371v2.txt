Paper deals with the singular Sturm-Liouville expressions l(y) = -(py')' + qy on a finite interval with coefficients q = Q', \quad 1/p, Q/p, Q^2/p \in L_1, where derivative of the function Q is understood in the sense of distributions. Due to a new regularization corresponding operators are correctly defined as quasi-differential. Their resolvent approximation is investigated and all self-adjoint and maximal dissipative extensions and generalized resolvents are described in terms of homogeneous boundary conditions of the canonic form. Some results are new for the case p(t)\equiv 1 as well.
