It is shown that the PT symmetric Hamiltonian with the periodic potential V(x) = 4 cos^2 x + 4 i V_0 sin 2x can be mapped into a Hermitian Hamiltonian for V_0<0.5, by a similarity transformation. It is also shown that there exist a second critical point of the potential V(x), apart from the known critical point V_0=0.5, for V_0^c ~ .888437 after which no part of the eigenvalues and the band structure remains real. Relevant physical consequence of this finding has been pointed out.
