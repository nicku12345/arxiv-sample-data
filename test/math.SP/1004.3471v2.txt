We study spectral properties of Schr\"odinger operators on \RR^d. The electromagnetic potential is assumed to be determined locally by a colouring of the lattice points in \ZZ^d, with the property that frequencies of finite patterns are well defined. We prove that the integrated density of states (spectral distribution function) is approximated by its finite volume analogues, i.e.the normalised eigenvalue counting functions. The convergence holds in the space L^p(I) where I is any finite energy interval and 1\leq p< \infty is arbitrary.
