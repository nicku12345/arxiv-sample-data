We obtain general trace formulae in the case of perturbation of self-adjoint operators by self-adjoint operators of class \bS_m, where m is a positive integer. In \cite{PSS} a trace formula for operator Taylor polynomials was obtained. This formula includes the Livshits--Krein trace formula in the case m=1 and the Koplienko trace formula in the case m=2. We establish most general trace formulae in the case of perturbation of Schatten--von Neumann class \bS_m. We also improve the trace formula obtained in \cite{PSS} for operator Taylor polynomials and prove it for arbitrary functions in he Besov space B_{\be1}^m(\R).   We consider several other special cases of our general trace formulae. In particular, we establish a trace formula for mth order operator differences.
