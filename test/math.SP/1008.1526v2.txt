We investigate the singular Weyl-Titchmarsh m-function of perturbed spherical Schroedinger operators (also known as Bessel operators) under the assumption that the perturbation q(x) satisfies x q(x) \in L^1(0,1). We show existence plus detailed properties of a fundamental system of solutions which are entire with respect to the energy parameter. Based on this we show that the singular m-function belongs to the generalized Nevanlinna class and connect our results with the theory of super singular perturbations.
