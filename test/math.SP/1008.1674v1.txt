Let A be a self-adjoint operator acting over a space X endowed with a partition. We give lower bounds on the energy of a mixed state \rho from its distribution in the partition and the spectral density of A. These bounds improve with the refinement of the partition, and generalize inequalities by Li-Yau and Lieb--Thirring for the Laplacian in \R^n. They imply an uncertainty principle, giving a lower bound on the sum of the spatial entropy of \rho, as seen from X, and some spectral entropy, with respect to its energy distribution. On \R^n, this yields lower bounds on the sum of the entropy of the densities of \rho and its Fourier transform. A general log-Sobolev inequality is also shown. It holds on mixed states, without Markovian or positivity assumption on A.
