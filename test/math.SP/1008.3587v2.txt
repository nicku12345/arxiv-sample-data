We consider 2- and 3-dimensional Schr\"odinger or generalized Schr\"odinger-Pauli operators with the non-degenerating magnetic field in the open domain under certain non-degeneracy assumptions we derive pointwise spectral asymptotics. We also consider asymptotics of some related expressions (see below). For all asymptotics loops rather than periodic trajectories play important role.
