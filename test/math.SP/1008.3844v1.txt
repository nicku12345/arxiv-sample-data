We consider probability measures on the real line or unit circle with Jacobi or Verblunsky coefficients satisfying an \ell^p condition and a generalized bounded variation condition. This latter condition requires that a sequence can be expressed as a sum of sequences \beta^{(l)}, each of which has rotated bounded variation, i.e., \sum_{n=0}^\infty | e^{i\phi_l} \beta_{n+1}^{(l)} - \beta_n^{(l)} | is finite for some \phi_l. This includes discrete Schr\"odinger operators on a half-line or line with finite linear combinations of Wigner--von Neumann type potentials.   For the real line, we prove that in the Lebesgue decomposition d\mu=f dm + d\mu_s of such measures, the intersection of (-2,2) with the support of d\mu_s is contained in an explicit finite set S (thus, d\mu has no singular continuous part), and f is continuous and non-vanishing on (-2,2) \setminus S. The results for the unit circle are analogous, with (-2,2) replaced by the unit circle.
