We consider the unperturbed operator H_0 : = (-i \nabla - A)^2 + W, self-adjoint in L^2(\R^2). Here A is a magnetic potential which generates a constant magnetic field b>0, and the edge potential W is a non-decreasing non constant bounded function depending only on the first coordinate x \in \R of (x,y) \in \R^2. Then the spectrum of H_0 has a band structure and is absolutely continuous; moreover, the assumption \lim_{x \to \infty}(W(x) - W(-x)) < 2b implies the existence of infinitely many spectral gaps for H_0. We consider the perturbed operators H_{\pm} = H_0 \pm V where the electric potential V \in L^{\infty}(\R^2) is non-negative and decays at infinity. We investigate the asymptotic distribution of the discrete spectrum of H_\pm in the spectral gaps of H_0. We introduce an effective Hamiltonian which governs the main asymptotic term; this Hamiltonian involves a pseudo-differential operator with generalized anti-Wick symbol equal to V. Further, we restrict our attention on perturbations V of compact support and constant sign. We establish a geometric condition on the support of V which guarantees the finiteness of the eigenvalues of H_{\pm} in any spectral gap of H_0. In the case where this condition is violated, we show that, generically, the convergence of the infinite series of eigenvalues of H_+ (resp. H_-) to the left (resp. right) edge of a given spectral gap, is Gaussian.
