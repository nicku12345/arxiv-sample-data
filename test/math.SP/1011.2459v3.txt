We say that a discrete set X =\{x_n\}_{n\in\dN_0} on the half-line 0=x_0 < x_1 <x_2 <x_3<... <x_n<... <+\infty is sparse if the distances \Delta x_n = x_{n+1} -x_n between neighbouring points satisfy the condition \frac{\Delta x_{n}}{\Delta x_{n-1}} \rightarrow +\infty. In this paper half-line Schr\"odinger operators with point \delta- and \delta^\prime-interactions on a sparse set are considered. Assuming that strengths of point interactions tend to \infty we give simple sufficient conditions for such Schr\"odinger operators to have non-empty singular continuous spectrum and to have purely singular continuous spectrum, which coincides with \dR_+.
