We construct a family of measures on \bbR that are purely singular with respect to Lebesgue measure, and yet exhibit universal sine-kernel asymptotics in the bulk. The measures are best described via their Jacobi recursion coefficients: these are sparse perturbations of the recursion coefficients corresponding to Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. We prove convergence of the renormalized Christoffel-Darboux kernel to the sine kernel for any sufficiently sparse decaying perturbation.
