Let (M^m,g) be a m-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold which satisfies the n-Sobolev inequality and on which the volume growth is comparable to the one of \R^n for big balls; if the Hodge Laplacian on 1-forms is strongly positive and the Ricci tensor is in L^{\frac{n}{2}\pm \epsilon} for an \epsilon>0, then we prove a Gaussian estimate on the heat kernel of the Hodge Laplacian on 1-forms. This allows us to prove that, under the same hypotheses, the Riesz transform d\Delta^{-1/2} is bounded on L^p for all 1
