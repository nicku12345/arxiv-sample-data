We prove Lieb-Thirring inequalities for Schr\"odinger operators with a homogeneous magnetic field in two and three space dimensions. The inequalities bound sums of eigenvalues by a semi-classical approximation which depends on the strength of the magnetic field, and hence quantifies the diamagnetic behavior of the system. For a harmonic oscillator in a homogenous magnetic field, we obtain the sharp constants in the inequalities.
