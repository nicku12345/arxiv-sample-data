In this paper we study the asymptotic expansion of the spectral shift function for the slowly varying perturbations of periodic Schr\"odinger operators. We give a weak and pointwise asymptotics expansions in powers of h of the derivative of the spectral shift function corresponding to the pair \big(P(h)=P_0+\phi(hx),P_0=-\Delta+V(x)\big), where \phi(x)\in {\mathcal C}^\infty(\mathbb R^n,\mathbb R) is a decreasing function, {\mathcal O}(|x|^{-\delta}) for some \delta>n and h is a small positive parameter. Here the potential V is real, smooth and periodic with respect to a lattice \Gamma in {\mathbb R}^n. To prove the pointwise asymptotic expansion of the spectral shift function, we establish a limiting absorption Theorem for P(h).
