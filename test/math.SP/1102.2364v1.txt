In the large coupling constant limit, we obtain an asymptotic expansion in powers of \mu^{-\frac{1}{\delta}} of the derivative of the spectral shift function corresponding to the pair \big(P_\mu=P_0+\mu W(x),P_0=-\Delta+V(x)\big), where W(x) is positive, W(x)\sim w_0(\frac{x}{|x|})|x|^{-\delta} near infinity for some \delta>n and w_0\in {\mathcal C}^\infty(\mathbb S^{n-1};\,\mathbb R_+). Here \mathbb S^{n-1} is the unite sphere of the space \mathbb R^n and \mu is a large parameter. The potential V is real-valued, smooth and periodic with respect to a lattice \Gamma in {\mathbb R}^n.
