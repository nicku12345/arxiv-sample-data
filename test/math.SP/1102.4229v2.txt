We prove that the ground state energy of an atom confined to two dimensions with an infinitely heavy nucleus of charge Z>0 and N quantum electrons of charge -1 is E(N,Z)=-{1/2}Z^2\ln Z+(E^{\TF}(\lambda)+{1/2}c^{\rm H})Z^2+o(Z^2) when Z\to \infty and N/Z\to \lambda, where E^{\TF}(\lambda) is given by a Thomas-Fermi type variational problem and c^{\rm H}\approx -2.2339 is an explicit constant. We also show that the radius of a two-dimensional neutral atom is unbounded when Z\to \infty, which is contrary to the expected behavior of three-dimensional atoms.
