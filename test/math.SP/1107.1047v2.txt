Recently, Chau [Quant. Inform. & Comp. 11, 721 (2011)] showed that one can define certain metrics and pseudo-metrics on U(n), the group of all n\times n unitary matrices, based on the arguments of the eigenvalues of the unitary matrices. More importantly, these metrics and pseudo-metrics have quantum information theoretical meanings. So it is instructive to study this kind of metrics and pseudo-metrics on U(n). Here we show that any symmetric norm on {\mathbb R}^n induces a metric on U(n). Furthermore, using the same technique, we prove an inequality concerning the eigenvalues of a product of two unitary matrices which generalizes a few inequalities obtained earlier by Chau [arXiv:1006.3614v1].
