We discuss various approaches to localization results for one-dimensional random Schr\"odinger operators, both discrete and continuum. We focus in particular on the approach based on F\"urstenberg's Theorem and the Kunz-Souillard method. These notes are based on a series of five one-hour lectures given at University College London in June/July 2011.
