For convex co-compact hyperbolic manifolds \Gamma\backslash \mathbb{H}^{n+1} for which the dimension of the limit set satisfies \delta_\Gamma< n/2, we show that the high-frequency Eisenstein series associated to a point \xi "at infinity" concentrate microlocally on a measure supported by (the closure of) the set of points in the unit cotangent bundle corresponding to geodesics ending at \xi. The average in \xi of these limit measures equidistributes towards the Liouville measure.
