We consider the Schr\"odinger operator Hy=-y"+(p+q)y with a periodic potential p plus a compactly supported potential q on the real line. The spectrum of H consists of an absolutely continuous part plus a finite number of simple eigenvalues below the spectrum and in each spectral gap \g_n\ne \es, n\ge1. We prove the following results: 1) the distribution of resonances in the disk with large radius is determined, 2) the asymptotics of eigenvalues and antibound states are determined at high energy gaps, 3) if H has infinitely many open gaps in the continuous spectrum, then for any sequence (\vk)_1^\iy, \vk_n\in \{0,2\}, there exists a compactly supported potential q with \int_\R qdx=0 such that H has \vk_n eigenvalues and 2-\vk_n antibound states (resonances) in each gap \g_n for n large enough.
