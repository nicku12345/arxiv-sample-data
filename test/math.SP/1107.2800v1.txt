We review recent results on localization for discrete alloy-type models based on the multiscale analysis and the fractional moment method, respectively. The discrete alloy-type model is a family of Schr\"odinger operators H_\omega = - \Delta + V_\omega on \ell^2 (\ZZ^d) where \Delta is the discrete Laplacian and V_\omega the multiplication by the function V_\omega (x) = \sum_{k \in \ZZ^d} \omega_k u(x-k). Here \omega_k, k \in \ZZ^d, are i.i.d. random variables and u \in \ell^1 (\ZZ^d ; \RR) is a so-called single-site potential. Since u may change sign, certain properties of H_\omega depend in a non-monotone way on the random parameters \omega_k. This requires new methods at certain stages of the localization proof.
