This paper provides a new proof of a theorem of Chandler-Wilde, Chonchaiya and Lindner that the spectra of a certain class of infinite, random, tridiagonal matrices contain the unit disc almost surely. It also obtains an analogous result for a more general class of random matrices whose spectra contain a hole around the origin. The presence of the hole forces substantial changes to the analysis.
