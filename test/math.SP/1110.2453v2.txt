We provide an abstract framework for singular one-dimensional Schroedinger operators with purely discrete spectra to show when the spectrum plus norming constants determine such an operator completely. As an example we apply our findings to prove a new uniqueness results for perturbed quantum mechanical harmonic oscillators. In addition, we also show how to establish a Hochstadt-Liebermann type result for these operators. Our approach is based on the singular Weyl-Titchmarsh theory which is extended to cover the present situation.
