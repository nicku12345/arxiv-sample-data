The standard model of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics describes non-relativistic quantum matter, such as atoms and molecules, coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. Within this model, we review basic notions, results and techniques in the theory of radiation. We describe the key technique in this area - the spectral renormalization group. Our review is based on joint works with Volker Bach and Juerg Froehlich and with Walid Abou Salem, Thomas Chen, Jeremy Faupin and Marcel Griesemer. Brief discussion of related contributions is given at the end of these lectures. This review will appear in "Quantum Theory from Small to Large Scales", Lecture Notes of the Les Houches Summer Schools, volume 95, Oxford University Press, 2011. Key words: quantum electrodynamics, photons and electrons, renormalization group, quantum resonances, spectral theory, Schroedinger operators, ground state, quantum dynamics, non-relativistic theory.
