We study in various functional spaces the equiconvergence of spectral decompositions of the Hill operator L= -d^2/dx^2 + v(x),  x \in [0,\pi],  with H_{per}^{-1} -potential and the free operator L^0=-d^2/dx^2,  subject to periodic, antiperiodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions.   In particular, we prove that  \|S_N - S_N^0: L^a \to L^b \| \to 0 \quad \text{if} \;\; 1<a \leq b< \infty, \;\; 1/a - 1/b <1/2,  where S_N and S_N^0  are the N-th partial sums of the spectral decompositions of L and L^0. Moreover, if v \in H^{-\alpha}  with 1/2 < \alpha < 1 and \frac{1}{a}=(3/2)-\alpha,  then we obtain uniform equiconvergence: \|S_N - S_N^0: L^a \to L^\infty \| \to 0  as N \to \infty.
