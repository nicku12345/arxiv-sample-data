We deal with operators in \mathbb{R}^n of the form \mathbf{A}=-{1\over \mathbf{b}(x)}\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\ds{\partial\over\partial x_k}(\mathbf{a}(x){\partial \over\partial x_k}) where \mathbf{a}(x),\mathbf{b}(x) are positive, bounded and periodic functions. We denote by \mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{per}} the set of such operators. The main result of this work is as follows: for an arbitrary L>0 and for arbitrary pairwise disjoint intervals (\alpha_j,\beta_j)\subset[0,L], j=1,...,m (m\in\mathbb{N}) we construct the family of operators \{\mathbf{A}^\varepsilon\in \mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{per}}\}_{\varepsilon} such that the spectrum of \mathbf{A}^\varepsilon has exactly m gaps in [0,L] when \varepsilon is small enough, and these gaps tend to the intervals (\alpha_j,\beta_j) as \varepsilon\to 0. The idea how to construct the family {\mathbf{A}\e}_\eps is based on methods of the homogenization theory.
