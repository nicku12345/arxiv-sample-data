We introduce the weighted graph Laplacian and the notion of Schr\"odinger operator on a locally finite weighted graph. Concerning essential self-adjointness, we extend Wojciechowski's and Dodziuk's results for graphs with vertex constant weight. The main result in this work states that on any metrically complete weighted graph with bounded degree, the weighted graph Laplacian is essentially self-adjoint and the same holds for the Schr\"odinger operator provided the associated quadratic form is bounded from below. We construct for the proof a strictly positive and harmonic function which allows us to write any Schr\"odinger operator as a weighted graph Laplacian modulo a unitary transform.
