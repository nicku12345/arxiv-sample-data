We construct examples of commuting ordinary scalar differential operators with polynomial coefficients that are related to a spectral curve of an arbitrary genus g and to an arbitrary even rank r = 2k, and also to an arbitrary rank of the form r = 3k, of the vector bundle of common eigenfunctions of the commuting operators over the spectral curve.
