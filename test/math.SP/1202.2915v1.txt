We consider infinite quasi-periodic Jacobi self-adjoint matrices for which the three main diagonals are given via values of real analytic functions on the trajectory of the shift x\rightarrow x+\omega. We assume that the Lyapunov exponent L(E_{0}) of the corresponding Jacobi cocycle satisfies L(E_{0})\ge\gamma>0. In this setting we prove that the number of eigenvalues E_{j}^{(n)}(x) of a submatrix of size n contained in an interval I centered at E_{0} with |I|=n^{-C_{1}} does not exceed (\log n)^{C_{0}} for any x. Here n\ge n_{0}, and n_{0}, C_{0}, C_{1} are constants depending on \gamma (and the other parameters of the problem).
