For real bounded functions \Phi and \Psi of compact support, we prove the norm resolvent convergence, as \epsilon and \nu tend to 0, of a family of one-dimensional Schroedinger operators on the line of the form S_{\epsilon, \nu}= -D^2+\alpha\epsilon^{-2}\Phi(\epsilon^{-1}x)+\beta\nu^{-1}\Psi(\nu^{-1}x), provided the ratio \nu/\epsilon has a finite or infinity limit. The limit operator S_0 depends on the shape of \Phi and \Psi as well as on the limit of ratio \nu/\epsilon. If the potential \alpha\Phi possesses a zero-energy resonance, then S_0 describes a non trivial point interaction at the origin. Otherwise S_0 is the direct sum of the Dirichlet half-line Schroedinger operators.
