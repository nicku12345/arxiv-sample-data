We study the spectral stability of a family of periodic wave trains of the Korteweg-de Vries/Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation  \partial_t v+v\partial_x v+\partial_x^3 v+\delta(\partial_x^2 v +\partial_x^4 v)=0, \delta>0, in the Korteweg-de Vries limit \delta\to 0, a canonical limit describing small-amplitude weakly unstable thin film flow. More precisely, we carry out a rigorous singular perturbation analysis reducing the problem to the evaluation for each Bloch parameter \xi\in [0,2\pi] of certain elliptic integrals derived formally (on an incomplete set of frequencies/Bloch parameters, hence as necessary conditions for stability) and numerically evaluated by Bar and Nepomnyashchy \cite{BN}, thus obtaining, up to machine error, complete conclusions about stability. The main technical difficulty is in treating the large-frequency and small Bloch-parameter regimes not studied by Bar and Nepomnyashchy \cite{BN}, which requires techniques rather different from classical Fenichel-type analysis. The passage from small-\delta to small-\xi behavior is particularly interesting, using in an essential way an analogy with hyperbolic relaxation at the level of the Whitham modulation equations.
