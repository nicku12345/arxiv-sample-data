We obtain a complete asymptotic expansion of the integrated density of states of operators of the form H =(-\Delta)^w +B in R^d. Here w >0, and B belongs to a wide class of almost-periodic self-adjoint pseudo-differential operators of order less than 2w. In particular, we obtain such an expansion for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators with either smooth periodic or generic almost-periodic coefficients.
