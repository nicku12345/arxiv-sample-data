Let A be a Banach algebra. By \sigma(x) and r(x) we denote the spectrum and the spectral radius of x\in A, respectively. We consider the relationship between elements a,b\in A that satisfy one of the following two conditions: (1) \sigma(ax) = \sigma(bx) for all x\in A, (2) r(ax) \le r(bx) for all x\in A. In particular we show that (1) implies a=b if A is a C^*-algebra, and (2) implies a\in \mathbb C b if A is a prime C^*-algebra. As an application of the results concerning the conditions (1) and (2) we obtain some spectral characterizations of multiplicative maps.
