We consider the relationship between derivations d and g of a Banach algebra B that satisfy \s(g(x)) \subseteq \s(d(x)) for every x\in B, where \s(\, . \,) stands for the spectrum. It turns out that in some basic situations, say if B=B(X), the only possibilities are that g=d, g=0, and, if d is an inner derivation implemented by an algebraic element of degree 2, also g=-d. The conclusions in more complex classes of algebras are not so simple, but are of a similar spirit. A rather definitive result is obtained for von Neumann algebras. In general C^*-algebras we have to make some adjustments, in particular we restrict our attention to inner derivations implemented by selfadjoint elements. We also consider a related condition \|[b,x]\|\leq M\|[a,x]\| for all selfadjoint elements x from a C^*-algebra B, where a,b\in B and a is normal.
