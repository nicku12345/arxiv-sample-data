We generalize earlier results of Peller, Aleksandrov - Peller, Aleksandrov - Peller - Potapov - Sukochev to the case of functions of n-tuples of commuting self-adjoint operators. In particular, we prove that if a function f belongs to the Besov space B_{\be,1}^1(\R^n), then f is operator Lipschitz and we show that if f satisfies a H\"older condition of order \a, then \|f(A_1...,A_n)-f(B_1,...,B_n)\|\le\const\max_{1\le j\le n}\|A_j-B_j\|^\a for all n-tuples of commuting self-adjoint operators (A_1,...,A_n) and (B_1,...,B_n). We also consider the case of arbitrary moduli of continuity and the case when the operators A_j-B_j belong to the Schatten--von Neumann class \bS_p.
