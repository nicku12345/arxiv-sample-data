Resonance and decay phenomena are ubiquitous in the quantum world. To understand them in their complexity it is useful to study solvable models in a wide sense, that is, systems which can be treated by analytical means. The present review offers a survey of such models starting the classical Friedrichs result and carrying further to recent developments in the theory of quantum graphs. Our attention concentrates on dynamical mechanism underlying resonance effects and at time evolution of the related unstable systems.
