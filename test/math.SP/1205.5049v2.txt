We find the high energy asymptotics for the singular Weyl--Titchmarsh m-functions and the associated spectral measures of perturbed spherical Schr\"odinger operators (also known as Bessel operators). We apply this result to establish an improved local Borg-Marchenko theorem for Bessel operators as well as uniqueness theorems for the radial quantum scattering problem with nontrivial angular momentum.
