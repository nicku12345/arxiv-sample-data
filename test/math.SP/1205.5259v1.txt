We investigate the low-energy excitation spectrum of a Bose gas confined in a trap, with weak long-range repulsive interactions. In particular, we prove that the spectrum can be described in terms of the eigenvalues of an effective one-particle operator, as predicted by the Bogoliubov approximation.
