We study a class of dynamical systems given by measure preserving actions of the group Z^d or R^d and generating a set of spectral measures with an extremal rate of the Fourier coefficient decay: \Hat\sigma(n) = O(|n|^{-1/2+\epsilon}) for any \epsilon > 0. Singular measures with this property are investigated in works due to Wiener and Wintner, Schaeffer, Salem, Ivashev-Musatov, Zygmund et al. Thus, the discovered effect provides a new construction of singular distributions of Schaeffer-Salem type on the torus T^d and in the space R^d.
