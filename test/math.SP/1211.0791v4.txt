We prove in this paper resolvent estimates for the boundary values of resolvents of selfadjoint operators on a Krein space: if H is a selfadjoint operator on a Krein space \cH, equipped with the Krein scalar product \langle \cdot| \cdot \rangle, A is the generator of a C_{0}-group on \cH and I\subset \rr is an interval such that: \begin{itemize} \item[]1) H admits a Borel functional calculus on I, \item[]2) the spectral projection \one_{I}(H) is positive in the Krein sense, \item[]3) the following {\em positive commutator estimate} holds: \[ \Re \langle u| [H, \i A]u\rangle\geq c \langle u| u\rangle, \ u \in {\rm Ran}\one_{I}(H), \ c>0. \] \end{itemize} then assuming some smoothness of H with respect to the group \e^{\i t A}, the following resolvent estimates hold: \[ \sup_{z\in I\pm \i]0, \nu]}\| \langle A\rangle ^{-s}(H-z)^{-1}\langle A\rangle^{-s}\| <\infty, \ s>\12. \] As an application we consider abstract Klein-Gordon equations \[ \p_{t}^{2}\phi(t)- 2 \i k \phi(t)+ h\phi(t)=0, \] and obtain resolvent estimates for their generators in {\em charge spaces} of Cauchy data.
