We find upper and lower bounds for the first eigenvalue and the volume entropy of a noncompact real analytic K\"ahler manifold, in terms of Calabi's diastasis function and diastatic entropy, which are sharp in the case of the complex hyperbolic space. As a corollary we obtain explicit lower bounds for the first eigenvalue of the geodesic balls of an Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type.
