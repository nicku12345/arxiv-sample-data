We consider a family of self-adjoint operators [H_\omega = - \Delta + \lambda V_\omega, \quad \omega \in \Omega = \bigtimes_{k \in \ZZ^d} \RR,] on the Hilbert space \ell^2 (\ZZ^d) or L^2 (\RR^d). Here \Delta denotes the Laplace operator (discrete or continuous), V_\omega is a multiplication operator given by the function V_\omega (x) = \sum_{k \in \ZZ^d} \omega_k u(x-k) on \ZZ^d, or \quad V_\omega (x) = \sum_{k \in \ZZ^d} \omega_k U(x-k) on \RR^d, and \lambda > 0 is a real parameter modeling the strength of the disorder present in the model. The functions u:\ZZ^d \to \RR and U:\RR^d \to \RR are called single-site potential. Moreover, there is a probability measure \PP on \Omega modeling the distribution of the individual configurations \omega \in \Omega. The measure \PP = \prod_{k \in \ZZ^d} \mu is a product measure where \mu is some probability measure on \RR satisfying certain regularity assumptions. The operator on L^2 (\RR^d) is called alloy-type model, and its analogue on \ell^2 (\ZZ^d) discrete alloy-type model.   This thesis refines the methods of multiscale analysis and fractional moments in the case where the single-site potential is allowed to change its sign. In particular, we develop the fractional moment method and prove exponential localization for the discrete alloy-type model in the case where the support of u is finite and u has fixed sign at the boundary of its support. We also prove a Wegner estimate for the discrete alloy-type model in the case of exponentially decaying but not necessarily finitely supported single-site potentials. This Wegner estimate is applicable for a proof of localization via multiscale analysis.
