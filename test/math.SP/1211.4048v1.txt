We investigate the spectral properties of the Schr\"odinger operators in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) with a singular interaction supported by an infinite family of concentric spheres  \mathbf{H}_{R,\alpha}=-\Delta+\sum_{k=1}^\infty\alpha_k\delta(|x|-r_k).  We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the operator \mathbf{H}_{R,\alpha} to be self-adjoint, lower-semibounded. Also we investigate the spectral types of \mathbf{H}_{R,\alpha}.
