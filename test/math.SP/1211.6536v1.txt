We study the p-independence of spectra of Laplace operators on graphs arising from regular Dirichlet forms on discrete spaces. Here, a sufficient criterion is given solely by a uniform subexponential growth condition. Moreover, under a mild assumption on the measure we show a one-sided spectral inclusion without any further assumptions. We study applications to normalized Laplacians including symmetries of the spectrum and a characterization for positivity of the Cheeger constant. Furthermore, we consider Laplacians on planar tessellations for which we relate the spectral p-independence to assumptions on the curvature.
