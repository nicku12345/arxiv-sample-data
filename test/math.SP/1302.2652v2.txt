We prove general uniqueness results for radial solutions of linear and nonlinear equations involving the fractional Laplacian (-\Delta)^s with s \in (0,1) for any space dimensions N \geq 1. By extending a monotonicity formula found by Cabre and Sire \cite{CaSi-10}, we show that the linear equation (-\Delta)^s u+ Vu = 0 in \mathbb{R}^N has at most one radial and bounded solution vanishing at infinity, provided that the potential V is a radial and non-decreasing. In particular, this result implies that all radial eigenvalues of the corresponding fractional Schr\"odinger operator H=(-\Delta)^s + V are simple. Furthermore, by combining these findings on linear equations with topological bounds for a related problem on the upper half-space \mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+, we show uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground state solutions for the nonlinear equation (-\Delta)^s Q + Q - |Q|^{\alpha} Q = 0 in \mathbb{R}^N for arbitrary space dimensions N \geq 1 and all admissible exponents \alpha >0. This generalizes the nondegeneracy and uniqueness result for dimension N=1 recently obtained by the first two authors in \cite{FrLe-10} and, in particular, the uniqueness result for solitary waves of the Benjamin--Ono equation found by Amick and Toland \cite{AmTo-91}.
