In this paper, we consider the 2D- Schr\"odinger operator with constant magnetic field H(V)=(D_x-By)^2+D_y^2+V_h(x,y), where V tends to zero at infinity and h is a small positive parameter. We will be concerned with two cases: the semi-classical limit regime V_h(x,y)=V(h x,h y), and the large coupling constant limit case V_h(x,y)=h^{-\delta} V(x,y). We obtain a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of h^2 of {\rm tr}(\Phi(H(V),h)), where \Phi(\cdot,h)\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb R;\mathbb R). We also give a Weyl type asymptotics formula with optimal remainder estimate of the counting function of eigenvalues of H(V).
