We study the stability of convergence of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, associated with a compactly supported measure, to the sine kernel, under perturbations of the Jacobi coefficients of the measure. We prove stability under variations of the boundary conditions and stability in a weak sense under \ell^1 and random \ell^2 diagonal perturbations. We also show that convergence to the sine kernel at x implies that \mu(\{x\})=0.
