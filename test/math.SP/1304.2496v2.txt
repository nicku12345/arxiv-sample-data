Using the procedures in \cite{Bu} and \cite{GMS} and the magnetic pseudodifferential calculus we have developped in \cite{MP1,MPR1,IMP1,IMP2} we construct an effective Hamitonian that describes the spectrum in any compact subset of the real axis for a large class of periodic pseudodifferential Hamiltonians in a bounded smooth magnetic field, in a completely gauge covariant setting, without any restrictions on the vector potential and without any adiabaticity hypothesis.
