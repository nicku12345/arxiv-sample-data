In this article, we investigate the application of wavelet packet transform as a novel spectrum sensing approach. The main attraction for wavelet packets is the tradeoffs they offer in terms of satisfying various performance metrics such as frequency resolution, variance of the estimated power spectral density (PSD) and complexity. The results of the experiments show that the wavelet based approach offers great flexibility, reconfigure ability and adaptability apart from its performances which are comparable and at times even better than Fourier based estimates.
