We consider a generalized Schr\"odinger operator in L^2(\R^2) with an attractive strongly singular interaction of \delta' type characterized by the coupling parameter \beta>0 and supported by a C^4-smooth closed curve \Gamma of length L without self-intersections. It is shown that in the strong coupling limit, \beta\to 0_+, the number of eigenvalues behaves as \frac{2L}{\pi\beta} + \OO(|\ln\beta|), and furthermore, that the asymptotic behaviour of the j-th eigenvalue in the same limit is -\frac{4}{\beta^2} +\mu_j+\OO(\beta|\ln\beta|), where \mu_j is the j-th eigenvalue of the Schr\"odinger operator on L^2(0,L) with periodic boundary conditions and the potential -\frac14 \gamma^2 where \gamma is the signed curvature of \Gamma.
