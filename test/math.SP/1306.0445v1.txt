We show that for any \lambda \in \mathbb{C} with |\lambda|<1 there exists an analytic expanding circle map such that the eigenvalues of the associated transfer operator (acting on holomorphic functions) are precisely the nonnegative powers of \lambda and \bar{\lambda}. As a consequence we obtain a counterexample to a variant of a conjecture of Mayer on the reality of spectra of transfer operators.
