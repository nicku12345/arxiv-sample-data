Let \Omega\subset\dR^d be a bounded or an unbounded Lipschitz domain. In this note we address the problem of continuation of functions from the Sobolev space H^1(\Omega) up to functions in the Sobolev space H^1(\dR^d) via a linear operator. The minimal possible norm of such an operator is estimated from below in terms of spectral properties of self-adjoint Robin Laplacians on domains \Omega and \dR^d\setminus\ov\Omega. Another estimate of this norm is also given, where spectral properties of Schr\"odinger operators with the \delta-interaction supported on the hypersurface \partial\Omega are involved. General results are illustrated with examples.
