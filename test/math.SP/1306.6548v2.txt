The purpose of this paper is to give explicit methods for bounding the number of vertices of finite k-regular graphs with given second eigenvalue. Let X be a finite k-regular graph and \mu_1(X) the second largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. It follows from the well-known Alon-Boppana Theorem, that for any \epsilon > 0 there are only finitely many such X with \mu_1(X) < (2 - \epsilon) \sqrt{k - 1}, and we effectively implement Serre's quantitative version of this result. For any k and \epsilon, this gives an explicit upper bound on the number of vertices in a k-regular graph with \mu_1(X) < (2 - \epsilon) \sqrt{k - 1}.
