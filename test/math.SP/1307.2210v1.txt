We consider a Banach algebra A with the property that, roughly speaking, sufficiently many irreducible representations of A on nontrivial Banach spaces do not vanish on all square zero elements. The class of Banach algebras with this property turns out to be quite large -- it includes C^*-algebras, group algebras on arbitrary locally compact groups, commutative algebras, L(X) for any Banach space X, and various other examples. Our main result states that every derivation of A that preserves the set of quasinilpotent elements has its range in the radical of A.
