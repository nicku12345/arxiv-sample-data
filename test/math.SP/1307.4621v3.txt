In this paper we study the non-Gaussian homogenous and isotropic field on the plane in frequency domain. The trispectrum and higher order spectra of such a field are described in terms of Bessel functions. Poisson formulae are given for the spectrum and for the bispectrum. Some particular integrals of Bessel functions are considered as well.
