The purpose of this paper is to prove some results about quantum mechanical black box scattering in even dimensions d \geq 2. We study the scattering matrix and prove some identities which hold for its meromorphic continuation onto \Lambda, the Riemann surface of the logarithm function. We relate the multiplicities of the poles of the continued scattering matrix to the multiplicities of the poles of the resolvent. Moreover, we show that the poles of the scattering matrix on the mth sheet of \Lambda are related to the zeros of a scalar function defined on the physical sheet. This paper contains a number of results about "pure imaginary" resonances. As an example, in contrast with the odd-dimensional case, we show that in even dimensions there are no "purely imaginary" resonances on any sheet of \Lambda for Schr\"odinger operators with potentials 0 \leq V \in L_0^\infty (\R^d).
