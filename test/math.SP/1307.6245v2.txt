We analyze perturbations of the harmonic oscillator type operators in a Hilbert space H, i.e. of the self-adjoint operator with simple positive eigenvalues \mu_k satisfying \mu_{k+1}-\mu_k \geq \Delta >0. Perturbations are considered in the sense of quadratic forms. Under a local subordination assumption, the eigenvalues of the perturbed operator become eventually simple and the root system forms a Riesz basis.
