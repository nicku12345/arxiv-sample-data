In this paper we discuss generalized Riesz products bringing into consideration H^p theory, the notion of Mahler measure, and the zeros of polynomials appearing in the generalized Riesz product. Formula for Radon-Nikodym derivative between two generalized Riesz product is established under suitable conditions. This is then used to formulate a Dichotomy theorem and prove a conditional version of it. A discussion involving flat polynomials is given.
