Let X and G be compact Lie groups, F_1:X\to X the time-one map of a C^\infty measure-preserving flow, \phi:X\to G a continuous function and \pi a finite-dimensional irreducible unitary representation of G. Then, we prove that the skew products  T_\phi:X\times G\to X\times G,\quad(x,g)\mapsto\big(F_1(x),g\;\phi(x)\big),  have purely absolutely continuous spectrum in the subspace associated to \pi if \pi\circ\phi has a Dini-continuous Lie derivative along the flow and if a matrix multiplication operator related to the topological degree of \pi\circ\phi has nonzero determinant. This result provides a simple, but general, criterion for the presence of an absolutely continuous component in the spectrum of skew products of compact Lie groups. As an illustration, we consider the cases where F_1 is an ergodic translation on \T^d and X\times G=\T^d\times\T^{d'}, X\times G=\T^d\times\SU(2) and X\times G=\T^d\times\U(2). Our proofs rely on recent results on positive commutator methods for unitary operators.
