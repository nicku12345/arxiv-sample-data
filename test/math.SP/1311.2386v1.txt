We consider the Laplacian in a domain squeezed between two parallel hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces of any dimension, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on one of the hypersurfaces and Neumann boundary conditions on the other. We derive two-term asymptotics for eigenvalues in the limit when the distance between the hypersurfaces tends to zero. The asymptotics are uniform and local in the sense that the coefficients depend only on the extremal points where the ratio of the area of the Neumann boundary to the Dirichlet one is locally the biggest.
