To every n-dimensional lens space L, we associate a congruence lattice \mathcal L in \mathbb Z^m, with n=2m-1 and we prove a formula relating the multiplicities of Hodge-Laplace eigenvalues on L with the number of lattice elements of a given \|\cdot\|_1-length in \mathcal L. As a consequence, we show that two lens spaces are isospectral on functions (resp.\ isospectral on p-forms for every p) if and only if the associated congruence lattices are \|\cdot\|_1-isospectral (resp.\ \|\cdot\|_1-isospectral plus a geometric condition). Using this fact, we give, for every dimension n\ge 5, infinitely many examples of Riemannian manifolds that are isospectral on every level p and are not strongly isospectral.
