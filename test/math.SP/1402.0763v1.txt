We consider the difference f(-\Delta +V)-f(-\Delta) of functions of Schr\"odinger operators in L^2(\mathbb R^d) and provide conditions under which this difference is trace class. We are particularly interested in non-smooth functions f and in V belonging only to some L^p space. This is motivated by applications in mathematical physics related to Lieb--Thirring inequalities. We show that in the particular case of Schr\"odinger operators the well-known sufficient conditions on f, based on a general operator theoretic result due to V. Peller, can be considerably relaxed. We prove similar theorems for f(-\Delta +V)-f(-\Delta)-\frac{d}{d\alpha} f(-\Delta +\alpha V)|_{\alpha=0}. Our key idea is the use of the limiting absorption principle.
