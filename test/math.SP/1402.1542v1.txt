The spectral and scattering theory for 1-dimensional Dirac operators with mass m and with zero-range interactions are fully investigated. Explicit expressions for the wave operators and for the scattering operator are provided. These new formulae take place in a representation which links, in a suitable way, the energies -\infty and +\infty, and which emphasizes the role of \pm m. Finally, a topological version of Levinson's theorem is deduced, with the threshold effects at \pm m automatically taken into account.
