We consider a self-adjoint two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator H_{\alpha\mu}, which corresponds to the formal differential expression \[ -\Delta - \alpha\mu, \] where \mu is a finite compactly supported positive Radon measure on {\mathbb R}^2 from the generalized Kato class and \alpha >0 is the coupling constant. It was proven earlier that \sigma_{\rm ess}(H_{\alpha\mu}) = [0,+\infty). We show that for sufficiently small \alpha the condition \sharp\sigma_{\rm d}(H_{\alpha\mu}) = 1 holds and that the corresponding unique eigenvalue has the asymptotic expansion    \lambda(\alpha) = -(C_\mu + o(1))\exp\Big(-\tfrac{4\pi}{\alpha\mu({\mathbb R}^2)}\Big), \qquad \alpha\rightarrow 0+,  with a certain constant C_\mu > 0. We obtain also the formula for the computation of C_\mu. The asymptotic expansion of the corresponding eigenfunction is provided. The statements of this paper extend Simon's results, see \cite{Si76}, to the case of potentials-measures. Also for regular potentials our results are partially new.
