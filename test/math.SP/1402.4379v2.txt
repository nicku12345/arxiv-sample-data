We consider two-dimensional Schroedinger operators with magnetic field. Under certain regularity and decay assumptions on the magnetic and electric field we show that the behavior of the corresponding resolvent at threshold and the behavior of the unitary group for large times are determined by the total flux of the associated magnetic field.
