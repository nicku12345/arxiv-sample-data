Weyl-von Neumann Theorem asserts that two bounded self-adjoint operators A,B on a Hilbert space H are unitarily equivalent modulo compacts, i.e., uAu^*+K=B for some unitary u\in \mathcal{U}(H) and compact self-adjoint operator K, if and only if A and B have the same essential spectra: \sigma_{\rm{ess}}(A)=\sigma_{\rm{ess}}(B). In this paper we consider to what extent the above Weyl-von Neumann's result can(not) be extended to unbounded operators using descriptive set theory. We show that if H is separable infinite-dimensional, this equivalence relation for bounded self-adjoin operators is smooth, while the same equivalence relation for general self-adjoint operators contains a dense G_{\delta}-orbit but does not admit classification by countable structures. On the other hand, apparently related equivalence relation A\sim B\Leftrightarrow \exists u\in \mathcal{U}(H)\ [u(A-i)^{-1}u^*-(B-i)^{-1} is compact], is shown to be smooth. Various Borel or co-analytic equivalence relations related to self-adjoint operators are also presented.
