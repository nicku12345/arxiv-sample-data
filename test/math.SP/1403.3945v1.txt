We obtain global pointwise estimates for kernels of the resolvents (I-T)^{-1} of integral operators \[Tf(x) = \int_{\Omega} K(x, y) f(y) d \omega(y)\] on L^2(\Omega, \omega) under the assumptions that ||T||_{L^2(\omega) \rightarrow L^2 (\omega)} <1 and d(x,y)=1/K(x,y) is a quasi-metric. Let K_1=K and K_j(x,y) = \int_{\Omega} K_{j-1} (x,z) K(z,y) \, d \omega (z) for j \geq 1. Then  K(x,y) e^{c K_2 (x,y)/K(x,y)} \leq \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} K_j(x,y) \leq K(x,y) e^{C K_2 (x,y)/K(x,y)},  for some constants c,C>0.   Our estimates yield matching bilateral bounds for Green's functions of the fractional Schr\"{o}dinger operators (-\triangle)^{\alpha/2}-q with arbitrary nonnegative potentials q on \mathbb{R}^n for 0<\alpha<n, or on a bounded non-tangentially accessible domain \Omega for 0<\alpha \le 2. In probabilistic language, these results can be reformulated as explicit bilateral bounds for the conditional gauge associated with Brownian motion or \alpha-stable L\'evy processes.
