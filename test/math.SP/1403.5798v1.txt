We consider a generalized Schr\"odinger operator in L^2(\mathbb R^2) describing an attractive \delta' interaction in a strong coupling limit. \delta' interaction is characterized by a coupling parameter \beta and it is supported by a C^4-smooth infinite asymptotically straight curve \Gamma without self-intersections. It is shown that in the strong coupling limit, \beta\to 0_+, the eigenvalues for a non-straight curve behave as -\frac{4}{\beta^2} +\mu_j+\mathcal O(\beta|\ln\beta|), where \mu_j is the j-th eigenvalue of the Schr\"odinger operator on L^2(\mathbb R) with the potential -\frac14 \gamma^2 where \gamma is the signed curvature of \Gamma.
