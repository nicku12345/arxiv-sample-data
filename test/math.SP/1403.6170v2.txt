We define the combinatorial Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and establish a gluing formula for determinants of discrete Laplacians using a combinatorial Gaussian quantum field theory. In case of a diagonal inner product on cochains we provide an explicit local expression for the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. We relate the gluing formula to the corresponding Mayer-Vietoris formula by Burghelea, Friedlander and Kappeler for zeta-determinants of analytic Laplacians, using the approximation theory of Dodziuk. Our argument motivates existence of gluing formulas as a consequence of a gluing principle on the discrete level.
