Non-self-adjoint Schrodinger operators which correspond to non-symmetric zero-range potentials are investigated. We show that various properties of these operators (eigenvalues, exceptional points, spectral singularities and the property of similarity to a self-adjoint operator) are completely determined by poles of the corresponding S-matrix.
