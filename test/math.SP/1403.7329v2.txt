We consider discrete random Schr\"odinger operators on \ell^2 (\mathbb{Z}^d) with a potential of discrete alloy-type structure. That is, the potential at lattice site x \in \mathbb{Z}^d is given by a linear combination of independent identically distributed random variables, possibly with sign-changing coefficients. In a first part we show that the discrete alloy-type model is not uniformly \tau-H\"older continuous, a frequently used condition in the literature of Anderson-type models with general random potentials. In a second part we review recent results on regularity properties of spectral data and localization properties for the discrete alloy-type model.
