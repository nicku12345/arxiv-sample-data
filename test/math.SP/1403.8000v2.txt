Benguria and Loss have conjectured that, amongst all smooth closed curves of length 2\pi in the plane, the lowest possible eigenvalue of the operator L=-\Delta+\kappa^2 was one. They observed that this value was achieved on a two-parameter family, \mathcal{O}, of geometrically distinct ovals containing the round circle and collapsing to a multiplicity-two line segment. We characterize the curves in \mathcal{O} as absolute minima of two related geometric functionals. We also discuss a connection with projective differential geometry and use it to explain the natural symmetries of all three problems.
