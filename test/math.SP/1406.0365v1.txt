Using representation theory, we compute the spectrum of the Dirac operator on the universal covering group of SL_2(\mathbb R), exhibiting it as the generator of KK^1(\mathbb C, \mathfrak A), where \mathfrak A is the reduced C^*-algebra of the group. This yields a new and direct computation of the K-theory of \mathfrak A. A fundamental role is played by the limit-of-discrete-series representation, which is the frontier between the discrete and the principal series of the group. We provide a detailed analysis of the localised spectra of the Dirac operator and compute the Dirac cohomology.
