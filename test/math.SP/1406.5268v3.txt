We study the statistics of Dirichlet eigenvalues of the random Schr\"odinger operator -\epsilon^{-2}\Delta^{(\text{d})}+\xi^{(\epsilon)}(x), with \Delta^{(\text{d})} the discrete Laplacian on \mathbb Z^d and \xi^{(\epsilon)}(x) uniformly bounded independent random variables, on sets of the form D_\epsilon:=\{x\in \mathbb Z^d\colon x\epsilon\in D\} for D\subset \mathbb R^d bounded, open and with a smooth boundary. If \mathbb E\xi^{(\epsilon)}(x)=U(x\epsilon) holds for some bounded and continuous U\colon D\to \mathbb R, we show that, as \epsilon\downarrow0, the k-th eigenvalue converges to the k-th Dirichlet eigenvalue of the homogenized operator -\Delta+U(x), where \Delta is the continuum Dirichlet Laplacian on D. Assuming further that \text{Var}(\xi^{(\epsilon)}(x))=V(x\epsilon) for some positive and continuous V\colon D\to \mathbb R, we establish a multivariate central limit theorem for simple eigenvalues centered by their expectation. The limiting covariance for a given pair of simple eigenvalues is expressed as an integral of V against the product of squares of the corresponding eigenfunctions of -\Delta+U(x).
