We consider the twisted waveguide \Omega_\theta, i.e. the domain obtained by the rotation of the bounded cross section \omega \subset {\mathbb R}^{2} of the straight tube \Omega : = \omega \times {\mathbb R} at angle \theta which depends on the variable along the axis of \Omega. We study the spectral properties of the Dirichlet Laplacian in \Omega_\theta, unitarily equivalent under the diffeomorphism \Omega_\theta \to \Omega to the operator H_{\theta'}, self-adjoint in {\rm L}^2(\Omega). We assume that \theta' = \beta - \epsilon where \beta is a 2\pi-periodic function, and \epsilon decays at infinity. Then in the spectrum \sigma(H_\beta) of the unperturbed operator H_\beta there is a semi-bounded gap (-\infty, {\mathcal E}_0^+), and, possibly, a number of bounded open gaps ({\mathcal E}_j^-, {\mathcal E}_j^+). Since \epsilon decays at infinity, the essential spectra of H_\beta and H_{\beta - \epsilon} coincide. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete spectrum of H_{\beta - \epsilon} near an arbitrary fixed spectral edge {\mathcal E}_j^\pm. We establish necessary and quite close sufficient conditions which guarantee the finiteness of \sigma_{\rm disc}(H_{\beta-\epsilon}) in a neighbourhood of {\mathcal E}_j^\pm. In the case where the necessary conditions are violated, we obtain the main asymptotic term of the corresponding eigenvalue counting function. The effective Hamiltonian which governs the the asymptotics of \sigma_{\rm disc}(H_{\beta-\epsilon}) near {\mathcal E}_j^\pm could be represented as a finite orthogonal sum of operators of the form -\mu\frac{d^2}{dx^2} - \eta \epsilon, self-adjoint in {\rm L}^2({\mathbb R}); here, \mu > 0 is a constant related to the so-called effective mass, while \eta is 2\pi-periodic function depending on \beta and \omega.
