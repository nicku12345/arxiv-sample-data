We consider the Laplacian with attractive Robin boundary conditions, \[ Q^\Omega_\alpha u=-\Delta u, \quad \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\alpha u \text{ on } \partial\Omega, \] in a class of bounded smooth domains \Omega\in\mathbb{R}^\nu; here n is the outward unit normal and \alpha>0 is a constant. We show that for each j\in\mathbb{N} and \alpha\to+\infty, the jth eigenvalue E_j(Q^\Omega_\alpha) has the asymptotics \[ E_j(Q^\Omega_\alpha)=-\alpha^2 -(\nu-1)H_\mathrm{max}(\Omega)\,\alpha+{\mathcal O}(\alpha^{2/3}), \] where H_\mathrm{max}(\Omega) is the maximum mean curvature at \partial \Omega. The discussion of the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality gives rise to a new geometric problem concerning the minimization of H_\mathrm{max}. In particular, we show that the ball is the strict minimizer of H_\mathrm{max} among the smooth star-shaped domains of a given volume, which leads to the following result: if B is a ball and \Omega is any other star-shaped smooth domain of the same volume, then for any fixed j\in\mathbb{N} we have E_j(Q^B_\alpha)>E_j(Q^\Omega_\alpha) for large \alpha. An open question concerning a larger class of domains is formulated.
