The Bochner Classification Theorem (1929) characterizes the polynomial sequences \p_{n}\}_{n=0}^{\infty}, with \text{deg}\,p_{n}=n that simultaneously form a complete set of eigenstates for a second-order differential operator and are orthogonal with respect to a positive Borel measure having finite moments of all orders. Indeed, up to a complex linear change of variable, only the classical Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials satisfy these conditions. In 2009, G\'{o}mez-Ullate, Kamran, and Milson found that for sequences \{p_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \text{deg}\,p_{n}=n (without the constant polynomial), the only such sequences are the exceptional X_{1}-Laguerre and X_{1}-Jacobi polynomials. Subsequently, other exceptional orthogonal polynomials \{p_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}\diagdown A} were discovered and studied (here A is a finite subset of the non-negative integers \mathbb{N}_{0} and \text{deg}\,p_{n}=n for all n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}\diagdown A). We call such a sequence an exceptional X_{\left\vert A\right\vert} sequence. Remarkably, all exceptional sequences found, to date, form a complete orthogonal set in their natural Hilbert space setting.   Among the exceptional sets already known are the Type I and Type II X_{m}-Laguerre polynomials, each omitting m polynomials. We briefly discuss these polynomials and construct self-adjoint operators generated by their corresponding second-order differential expressions in appropriate Hilbert spaces. In addition, we present a new Type III family of X_{m}-Laguerre polynomials along with a detailed disquisition of its properties. We include several representations of these polynomials, orthogonality, norms, completeness, the location of their local extrema and roots, root asymptotics, as well as the spectral study of the second-order Type III exceptional X_{m}-Laguerre differential expression.
