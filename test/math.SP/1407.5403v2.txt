We establish a connection between the L^2 norm of sums of dilated functions whose jth Fourier coefficients are \mathcal{O}(j^{-\alpha}) for some \alpha \in (1/2,1), and the spectral norms of certain greatest common divisor (GCD) matrices. Utilizing recent bounds for these spectral norms, we obtain sharp conditions for the convergence in L^2 and for the almost everywhere convergence of series of dilated functions.
