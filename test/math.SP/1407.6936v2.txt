This paper develops a weighted L^2-method for the (half) Dirac equation. For Dirac bundles over closed Riemann surfaces, we give a sufficient condition for the solvability of the (half) Dirac equation in terms of a curvature integral. Applying this to the Dolbeault-Dirac operator, we establish an automatic transversality criteria for holomorphic curves in K\"ahler manifolds. On compact Riemannian manifolds, we give a new perspective on some well-known results about the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator, and improve the estimates when the Dirac bundle has a Z_2-grading. On Riemannian manifolds with cylindrical ends, we obtain solvability in the L^2-space with suitable exponential weights while allowing mild negativity of the curvature.
