We provide an explicit lower bound for the the sum of the non-negative Lyapunov exponents for some cocycles related to the Anderson model. In particular, for the Anderson model on a strip of width  W  the lower bound is proportional to  W^{-\epsilon} , for any  \epsilon>0 . This bound is consistent with the fact that the lowest non-negative Lyapunov exponent is conjectured to have a lower bound proportional to  W^{-1} .
