We consider the quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operator  [H \psi](x) = -\psi"(x) + V(x) \psi(x)  in L^2(\mathbb{R}), where the potential is given by  V(x) = \sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}^\nu \setminus \{ 0 \}} c(m)\exp (2\pi i m \omega x)  with a Diophantine frequency vector \omega = (\omega_1, \dots, \omega_\nu) \in \mathbb{R}^\nu and exponentially decaying Fourier coefficients |c(m)| \le \varepsilon \exp(-\kappa_0|m|). In the regime of small \varepsilon > 0 we show that the spectrum of the operator H is homogeneous in the sense of Carleson.
