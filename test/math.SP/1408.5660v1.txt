We consider a Schr\"odinger operator H=-\Delta+V(\vec x) in dimension two with a quasi-periodic potential V(\vec x). We prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of H contains a semiaxis and there is a family of generalized eigenfunctions at every point of this semiaxis with the following properties. First, the eigenfunctions are close to plane waves e^{i\langle \vec \varkappa,\vec x\rangle} at the high energy region. Second, the isoenergetic curves in the space of momenta \vec \varkappa corresponding to these eigenfunctions have a form of slightly distorted circles with holes (Cantor type structure). A new method of multiscale analysis in the momentum space is developed to prove these results.   The result is based on the previous paper [1] on quasiperiodic polyharmonic operator (-\Delta)^l+V(\vec x), l>1. We address here technical complications arising in the case l=1. However, this text is self-contained and can be read without familiarity with [1].
