We consider the Laplacian in a tubular neighbourhood of a hyperplane subjected to non-self-adjoint \mathcal{PT}-symmetric Robin boundary conditions. Its spectrum is found to be purely essential and real for constant boundary conditions. The influence of the perturbation in the boundary conditions on the threshold of the essential spectrum is studied using the Birman-Schwinger principle. Our aim is to derive a sufficient condition for existence, uniqueness and reality of discrete eigenvalues. We show that discrete spectrum exists when the perturbation acts in the mean against the unperturbed boundary conditions and we are able to obtain the first term in its asymptotic expansion in the weak coupling regime.
