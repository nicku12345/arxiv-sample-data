We consider the product of spectral projections  \Pi_\epsilon(\lambda) = 1_{(-\infty,\lambda-\epsilon)}(H_0) 1_{(\lambda+\epsilon,\infty)}(H) 1_{(-\infty,\lambda-\epsilon)}(H_0)  where H_0 and H are the free and the perturbed Schr\"odinger operators with a short range potential, \lambda>0 is fixed and \epsilon\to0. We compute the leading term of the asymptotics of \mathrm{Tr}\ f(\Pi_\epsilon(\lambda)) as \epsilon\to0 for continuous functions f vanishing sufficiently fast near zero. Our construction elucidates calculations that appeared earlier in the theory of "Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe" and emphasizes the role of Hankel operators in this phenomenon.
