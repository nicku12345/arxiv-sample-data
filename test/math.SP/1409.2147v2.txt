We present an abstract multiscale analysis scheme for matrix functions (H_{\varepsilon}(m,n))_{m,n\in \mathfrak{T}}, where \mathfrak{T} is an Abelian group equipped with a distance |\cdot|. This is an extension of the scheme developed by Damanik and Goldstein for the special case \mathfrak{T} = \mathbb{Z}^\nu. Our main motivation for working out this extension comes from an application to matrix functions which are dual to certain Hill operators. These operators take the form H_{\tilde\omega}=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \varepsilon U(\tilde\omega x), where U is a real smooth function on the torus \mathbb{T}^\nu, \tilde\omega\in \mathbb{R}^\nu is a vector with rational components, and \varepsilon is a small parameter. The group in this particular case is the quotient \mathfrak{T} = \mathbb{Z}^\nu/\{m\in\mathbb{Z}^\nu:m\tilde\omega=0\}. We show that the general theory indeed applies to this special case, provided that the rational frequency vector \tilde\omega obeys a suitable Diophantine condition in a large box of modes. Despite the fact that in this setting the orbits k + m\omega, k \in \mathbb{R}, m\in\mathbb{Z}^\nu are not dense, the dual eigenfunctions are exponentially localized and the eigenvalues of the operators can be described as E(k+m\omega) with E(k) being a "nice" monotonic function of the impulse k \ge 0. This enables us to derive a description of the Floquet solutions and the band-gap structure of the spectrum, which we will use in a companion paper to develop a complete inverse spectral theory for the Sturm-Liouville equation with small quasi-periodic potential via periodic approximation of the frequency. The analysis of the gaps in the range of the function E(k) plays a crucial role in this approach.
