We prove that certain natural random variables associated with the local eigenvalue statistics for generalized lattice Anderson models constructed with finite-rank perturbations are compound Poisson distributed. This distribution is characterized by the fact that the Levy measure is supported on at most a finite set determined by the rank. The proof relies on a Minami-type estimate for finite-rank perturbations. For Anderson-type continuum models on \R^d, we prove a similar result for certain natural random variables associated with the local eigenvalue statistics. We prove that the compound Poisson distribution associated with these random variables has a Levy measure whose support is at most the set of positive integers.
