We investigate the existence of resonances for two-centers Coulomb systems with arbitrary charges in two dimensions, defining them in terms of generalised complex eigenvalues of a non-selfadjoint deformation of the two-centers Schr\"odinger operator. We construct the resolvent kernels of the operators and prove that they can be extended analytically to the second Riemann sheet. The resonances are then analysed by means of perturbation theory and numerical methods.
