In even dimensional Euclidean scattering, the resonances lie on the logarithmic cover of the complex plane. This paper studies resonances for obstacle scattering in {\mathbb R}^d with Dirchlet or admissable Robin boundary conditions, when d is even. Set n_m(r) to be the number of resonances with norm at most r and argument between m\pi and (m+1)\pi. Then \lim\sup _{r\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\log n_m(r)}{\log r}=d if m\in {\mathbb Z}\setminus \{ 0\}.
