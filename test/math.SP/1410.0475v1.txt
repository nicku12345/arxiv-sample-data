We compute the curvature of the determinant line bundle on a family of Dirac operators for a noncommutative two torus. Following Quillen's original construction for Riemann surfaces and using zeta regularized determinant of Laplacians, one can endow the determinant line bundle with a natural Hermitian metric. By using an analogue of Kontsevich-Vishik canonical trace, defined on Connes' algebra of classical pseudodifferential symbols for the noncommutative two torus, we compute the curvature form of the determinant line bundle by computing the second variation \delta_{w}\delta_{\bar{w}}\log\det(\Delta).
