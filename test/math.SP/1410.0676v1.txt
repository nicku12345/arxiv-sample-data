In this paper, generalizing to the non smooth case already existing results, we prove that, for any convex planar set \Omega, the first non-trivial Neumann eigenvalue \mu_1(\Omega) of the Hermite operator is greater than or equal to 1. Furthermore, and this is our main result, under some additional assumptions on \Omega, we show that \mu_1(\Omega)=1 if and only if \Omega is any strip. The study of the equality case requires, among other things, an asymptotic analysis of the eigenvalues of the Hermite operator in thin domains.
