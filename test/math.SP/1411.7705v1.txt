We prove uniform resolvent estimates for an abstract operator given by a dissipative perturbation of a self-adjoint operator in the sense of forms. For this we adapt the commutators method of Mourre. We also obtain the limiting absorption principle and uniform estimates for the derivatives of the resolvent. This abstract work is motivated by the Schr{\"o}dinger and wave equations on a wave guide with dissipation at the boundary.
