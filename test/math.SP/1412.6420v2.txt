As a model for an interface in solid state physics, we consider two real-valued potentials V^{(1)} and V^{(2)} on the cylinder or tube S=\mathbb R \times (\mathbb R/\mathbb Z) where we assume that there exists an interval (a_0,b_0) which is free of spectrum of -\Delta+V^{(k)} for k=1,2. We are then interested in the spectrum of H_t = -\Delta + V_t, for t \in \mathbb R, where V_t(x,y) = V^{(1)}(x,y), for x > 0, and V_t(x,y) = V^{(2)}(x+t,y), for x < 0. While the essential spectrum of H_t is independent of t, we show that discrete spectrum, related to the interface at x = 0, is created in the interval (a_0, b_0) at suitable values of the parameter t, provided -\Delta + V^{(2)} has some essential spectrum in (-\infty, a_0]. We do not require V^{(1)} or V^{(2)} to be periodic. We furthermore show that the discrete eigenvalues of H_t are Lipschitz continuous functions of t if the potential V^{(2)} is locally of bounded variation.
