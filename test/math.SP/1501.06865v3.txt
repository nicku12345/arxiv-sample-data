We consider the Schr\"odinger operator H_{\eta W} = -\Delta + \eta W, self-adjoint in L^2({\mathbb R}^d), d \geq 1. Here \eta is a non constant almost periodic function, while W decays slowly and regularly at infinity. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete spectrum of H_{\eta W} near the origin, and due to the irregular decay of \eta W, we encounter some non semiclassical phenomena. In particular, H_{\eta W} has less eigenvalues than suggested by the semiclassical intuition.
