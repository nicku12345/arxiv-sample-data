In numerical analysis it is often necessary to estimate the condition number CN(T)=||T||_{} \cdot||T^{-1}||_{} and the norm of the resolvent ||(\zeta-T)^{-1}||_{} of a given n\times n matrix T. We derive new spectral estimates for these quantities and compute explicit matrices that achieve our bounds. We recover the well-known fact that the supremum of CN(T) over all matrices with ||T||_{} \leq1 and minimal absolute eigenvalue r=\min_{i=1,...,n}|\lambda_{i}|>0 is the Kronecker bound \frac{1}{r^{n}}. This result is subsequently generalized by computing the corresponding supremum of ||(\zeta-T)^{-1}||_{} for any |\zeta| \leq1. We find that the supremum is attained by a triangular Toeplitz matrix. This provides a simple class of structured matrices on which condition numbers and resolvent norm bounds can be studied numerically. The occuring Toeplitz matrices are so-called model matrices, i.e. matrix representations of the compressed backward shift operator on the Hardy space H_2 to a finite-dimensional invariant subspace.
