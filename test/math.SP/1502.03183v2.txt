In recent joint work with Vasy, we analyze the low energy behavior of differential form-valued waves on black hole spacetimes. In order to deduce asymptotics and decay from this, one in addition needs high energy estimates for the wave operator acting on sections of the form bundle. The present paper provides these on perturbations of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spaces in all spacetime dimensions n\geq 4. In fact, we prove exponential decay, up to a finite-dimensional space of resonances, of waves valued in any finite rank subbundle of the tensor bundle, which in particular includes differential forms and symmetric tensors. As the main technical tool for working on vector bundles that do not have a natural positive definite inner product, we introduce pseudodifferential inner products, which are inner products depending on the position in phase space.
