We consider a family of quantum graphs \{(\Gamma,\mathcal{A}_\varepsilon)\}_{\varepsilon>0}, where \Gamma is a \mathbb{Z}^n-periodic metric graph and the periodic Hamiltonian \mathcal{A}_\varepsilon is defined by the operation -\varepsilon^{-1} {\mathrm{d} ^2\over \mathrm{d} x^2} on the edges of \Gamma and either \delta'-type conditions or the Kirchhoff conditions at its vertices. Here \varepsilon>0 is a small parameter. We show that the spectrum of \mathcal{A}_\varepsilon has at least m gaps as \varepsilon\to 0 (m\in\mathbb{N} is a predefined number), moreover the location of these gaps can be nicely controlled via a suitable choice of the geometry of \Gamma and of coupling constants involved in \delta'-type conditions.
