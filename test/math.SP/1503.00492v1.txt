We investigate existence and uniqueness of solutions of a McKean-Vlasov evolution PDE representing the macroscopic behaviour of interacting Fitzhugh-Nagumo neurons. This equation is hypoelliptic, nonlocal and has unbounded coefficients. We prove existence of a solution to the evolution equation and non trivial stationary solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate uniqueness of the stationary solution in the weakly nonlinear regime. Eventually, using a semigroup factorisation method, we show exponential nonlinear stability in the small connectivity regime.
