Let G be a finite group, and S be a subset of G\setminus\{1\} such that S=S^{-1}. Suppose that Cay(G,S) is the Cayley graph on G with respect to the set S which is the graph whose vertex set is G and two vertices a,b\in G are adjacent if and only if ab^{-1}\in S. The adjacency spectrum Spec(\Gamma) of a graph \Gamma is the multiset of eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. A graph \Gamma is called "determined by its spectrum" (or for short DS) whenever if a graph \Gamma' has the same spectrum as \Gamma, then \Gamma \cong \Gamma'. We say that the group G is DS (Cay-DS, respectively) whenever if \Gamma is a Cayley graph over G and Spec(\Gamma)=Spec(\Gamma') for some graph (Cayley graph, respectively) \Gamma', then \Gamma \cong \Gamma'. In this paper, we study finite DS groups and finite Cay-DS groups. In particular we prove that all finite DS groups are solvable and all Sylow p-subgroups of a finite DS group is cyclic for all p\geq 5. We also give several infinite families of non Cay-DS solvable groups. In particular we prove that there exist two cospectral non-isomorphic 6-regular Cayley graphs on the dihedral group of order 2p for any prime p\geq 13.
