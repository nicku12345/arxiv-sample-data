We give, as L grows to infinity, an explicit lower bound of order L^{n/m} for the expected Betti numbers of the vanishing locus of a random linear combination of eigenvectors of P with eigenvalues below L. Here, P denotes an elliptic self-adjoint pseudo-differential operator of order m\textgreater{}0, bounded from below and acting on the sections of a Riemannian line bundle over a smooth closed n-dimensional manifold M equipped with some Lebesgue measure. In fact, for every closed hypersurface \Sigma of \mathbb R^n, we prove that there exists a positive constant p\_\Sigma depending only on \Sigma, such that for every large enough L and every x\in M, a component diffeomorphic to \Sigma appears with probability at least p\_\Sigma in the vanishing locus of a random section and in the ball of radius L^{-1/m} centered at x. These results apply in particular to Laplace-Beltrami and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators.
