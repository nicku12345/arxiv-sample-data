Let N be an integral operator of the form \bigl(Nu\bigr)(x)=\int_{\mathbb R^c}n(x,x-y)\,u(y)\,dy acting in L_p(\mathbb R^c) with a measurable kernel n satisfying the estimate |n(x,y)|\le\beta(y), where \beta\in L_1. It is proved that if the function t\mapsto n(t,\cdot) is continuous in the norm of L_1 and the operator \mathbf1+N has an inverse, then (\mathbf1+N)^{-1}=\mathbf1+M, where M is an integral operator possessing the same properties.
