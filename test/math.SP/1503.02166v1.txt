Time-dependent scattering theory for a large class of translation invariant models, including the Nelson and Polaron models, restricted to the vacuum and one-particle sectors is studied. We formulate and prove asymptotic completeness for these models. The translation invariance imply that the Hamiltonians considered are fibered with respect to the total momentum. On the way to asymptotic completeness we determine the spectral structure of the fiber Hamiltonians, establish a Mourre estimate and derive a geometric asymptotic completeness statement as an intermediate step.
