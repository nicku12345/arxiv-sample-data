Consider --- for the generator \({-}A\) of a symmetric contraction semigroup over some measure space \mathrm{X}, 1\le p < \infty, q the dual exponent and given measurable functions F_j,\: G_j : \mathbb{C}^d \to \mathbb{C} --- the statement:  \mathrm{Re}\, \sum_{j=1}^m \int_{\mathrm{X}} A F_j(\mathbf{f}) \cdot G_j(\mathbf{f}) \,\,\ge \,\,0  {\em for all \mathbb{C}^d-valued measurable functions \mathbf{f} on \mathrm{X} such that F_j(\mathbf{f}) \in \mathrm{dom}(A_p) and G_j(\mathbf{f}) \in \mathrm{L}^q(\mathrm{X}) for all j.}   It is shown that this statement is valid in general if it is valid for \mathrm{X} being a two-point Bernoulli (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})-space and A being of a special form. As a consequence we obtain a new proof for the optimal angle of \mathrm{L}^{p}-analyticity for such semigroups, which is essentially the same as in the well-known sub-Markovian case.   The proof of the main theorem is a combination of well-known reduction techniques and some representation results about operators on \mathrm{C}(K)-spaces. One focus of the paper lies on presenting these auxiliary techniques and results in great detail.
