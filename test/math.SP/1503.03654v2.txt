We give a proof of the exact asymptotic behaviour in Anderson's Orthogonality Catastrophe for Dirac-\delta perturbations. We prove the exact asymptotics of the scalar product of the ground states of two non-interacting Fermi gases confined to a 3-dimensional ball B_L of radius L in the thermodynamic limit, where the underlying one-particle operators differ by a Dirac-\delta perturbation. More precisely, we show the algebraic decay of the correlation determinant \big|\det\big(\langle\varphi_j^L, \psi_k^L\rangle\big)_{j,k=1,...,N}\big|^2= L^{-\zeta(E)+ \text{o}(1)}, as N,L\to\infty and N/|B_L|\to~ \rho>0, where \varphi_j^L and \psi_k^L denote the lowest-energy eigenfunctions of the finite-volume one-particle Schr\"odinger operators. The decay exponent is given in terms of the s-wave scattering phase shift \zeta(E):=\delta^2(\sqrt E)/{\pi^2}. For an attractive Dirac-\delta perturbation we conclude that the decay exponent \frac 1 {\pi^2}\Vert\arcsin |T(E)/2|\Vert^2_{\text{HS}} found in [GKMO14] does not provide a sharp upper bound on the decay of the correlation determinant.
