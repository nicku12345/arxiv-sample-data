We consider the problem of prescribing the nodal set of the first nontrivial eigenfunction of the Laplacian in a conformal class. Our main result is that, given a separating closed hypersurface \Sigma in a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g_0) of dimension d \geq 3, there is a metric g on M conformally equivalent to g_0 and with the same volume such that the nodal set of its first nontrivial eigenfunction is a C^0-small deformation of \Sigma (i.e., \Phi(\Sigma) with \Phi : M \to M a diffeomorphism arbitrarily close to the identity in the C^0 norm).
