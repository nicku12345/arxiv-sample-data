We derive the equation of a free vibrating thin plate whose mass is concentrated at the boundary, namely a Steklov problem for the biharmonic operator. We provide Hadamard-type formulas for the shape derivatives of the corresponding eigenvalues and prove that balls are critical domains under volume constraint. Finally, we prove an isoperimetric inequality for the first positive eigenvalue.
