Laptev and Safronov conjectured that any non-positive eigenvalue of a Schr\"odinger operator -\Delta+V in L^2(\mathbb R^\nu) with complex potential has absolute value at most a constant times \|V\|_{\gamma+\nu/2}^{(\gamma+\nu/2)/\gamma} for 0<\gamma\leq\nu/2 in dimension \nu\geq 2. We prove this conjecture for radial potentials if 0<\gamma<\nu/2 and we `almost disprove' it for general potentials if 1/2<\gamma<\nu/2. In addition, we prove various bounds that hold, in particular, for positive eigenvalues.
