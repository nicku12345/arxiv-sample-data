Let \lambda_j be the j-th eigenvalue of Sturm-Liouville systems with separated boundary conditions, we build up the Hill-type formula, which represent \prod\limits_{j}(1-\lambda_j^{-1}) as a determinant of finite matrix. This is the first attack on such a formula under non-periodic type boundary conditions. Consequently, we get the Krein-type trace formula based on the Hill-type formula, which express \sum\limits_{j}{1\over \lambda_j^m} as trace of finite matrices. The trace formula can be used to estimate the conjugate point alone a geodesic in Riemannian manifold and to get some infinite sum identities.
