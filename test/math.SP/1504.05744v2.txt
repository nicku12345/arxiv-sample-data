We show that for a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with a potential whose (j+1)'th moment is integrable the j'th derivative of the scattering matrix is in the Wiener algebra of functions with integrable Fourier transforms. We use this result to improve the known dispersive estimates with integrable time decay for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation in the resonant case.
