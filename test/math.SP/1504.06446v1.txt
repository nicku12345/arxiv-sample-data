Truncated Toeplitz operators and their asymmetric versions are studied in the context of the Hardy space H^p of the half-plane for 1<p<\infty. It is shown that they are equivalent after extension to 2 \times 2 matricial Toeplitz operators, which allows one to deduce information about their invertibility properties. Shifted model spaces are presented in the context of invariant subspaces, allowing one to deduce new Beurling--Lax theorems.
