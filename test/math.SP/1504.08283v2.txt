In the case of compact quantum graphs, many-particle models with singular two-particle interactions where introduced in [arXiv:1207.5648, arXiv:1112.4751] to provide a paradigm for further studies on many-particle quantum chaos. In this note, we discuss various aspects of such singular interactions in a two-particle system restricted to the half-line \mathbb{R}_+. Among others, we give a description of the spectrum of the two-particle Hamiltonian and obtain upper bounds on the number of eigenstates below the essential spectrum. We also specify conditions under which there is exactly one such eigenstate. As a final result, it is shown that the ground state is unique and decays exponentially as \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \to \infty.
