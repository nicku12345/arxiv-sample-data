We analyze spectral properties of the ultrarelativistic (Cauchy) operator |\Delta |^{1/2}, provided its action is constrained exclusively to the interior of the interval [-1,1] \subset R. To this end both analytic and numerical methods are employed. New high-accuracy spectral data are obtained. A direct analytic proof is given that trigonometric functions \cos(n\pi x/2) and \sin(n\pi x), for integer n are {\it not} the eigenfunctions of |\Delta |_D^{1/2}, D=(-1,1). This clearly demonstrates that the traditional Fourier multiplier representation of |\Delta |^{1/2} becomes defective, while passing from R to a bounded spatial domain D\subset R.
