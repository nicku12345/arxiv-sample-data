We analyze spectral properties of a leaky wire model with a potential bias. It describes a two-dimensional quantum particle exposed to a potential consisting of two parts. One is an attractive \delta-interaction supported by a non-straight, piecewise smooth curve \mathcal{L} dividing the plane into two regions of which one, the `interior', is convex. The other interaction component is a constant positive potential V_0 in one of the regions. We show that in the critical case, V_0=\alpha^2, the discrete spectrum is non-void if and only if the bias is supported in the interior. We also analyze the non-critical situations, in particular, we show that in the subcritical case, V_0<\alpha^2, the system may have any finite number of bound states provided the angle between the asymptotes of \mathcal{L} is small enough.
