We prove quantum ergodicity for certain orthonormal bases of L^2(\mathbb{S}^2), consisting of joint eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on \mathbb{S}^2 and the discrete averaging operator over a finite set of rotations, generating a free group. If in addition the rotations are algebraic we give a quantified version of this result. The methods used also give a new, simplified proof of quantum ergodicity for large regular graphs.
