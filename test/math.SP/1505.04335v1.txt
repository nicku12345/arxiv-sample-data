We show that the family of probability measures on the n-dimensional unit sphere, having density proportional to: \[ S^n \ni y \mapsto \frac{1}{|y - x|^{n+\alpha}}, \] satisfies the Curvature-Dimension condition CD(n-1-\frac{n+\alpha}{4},-\alpha), for all |x| < 1, \alpha \geq -n and n\geq 2. The case \alpha = 1 corresponds to the hitting distribution of the sphere by Brownian motion started at x (so-called "harmonic measure" on the sphere). Applications involving isoperimetric, spectral-gap and concentration estimates, as well as potential extensions, are discussed.
