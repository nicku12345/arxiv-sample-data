We study the long time dynamics of the Schr\"odinger equation on Zoll manifolds. We establish criteria under which the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation can or cannot concentrate on a given closed geodesic. As an application, we derive some results on the set of semiclassical measures for eigenfunctions of Schr\"odinger operators: we prove that adding a potential to the Laplacian on the sphere results on the existence of geodesics \gamma such that \delta_\gamma cannot be obtained as a semiclassical measure for some sequence of eigenfunctions. We also show that the same phenomenon occurs for the free Laplacian on certain Zoll surfaces.
