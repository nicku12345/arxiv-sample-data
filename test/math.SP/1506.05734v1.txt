Let K(\gamma) be the weakly equilibrium Cantor type set introduced in [10]. It is proven that the monic orthogonal polynomials Q_{2^s} with respect to the equilibrium measure of K(\gamma) coincide with the Chebyshev polynomials of the set. Procedures are suggested to find Q_{n} of all degrees and the corresponding Jacobi parameters. It is shown that the sequence of the Widom factors is bounded below.
