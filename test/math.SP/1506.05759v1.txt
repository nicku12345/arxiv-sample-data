We study the spectral shift function (SSF) \xi(\lambda) and the resonances of the operator H_V := \big( \sigma \cdot (-i\nabla - \textbf{A}) \big)^{2} + V in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3) near the origin. Here \sigma := (\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3) are the 2 \times 2 Pauli matrices and V is a hermitian potential decaying exponentially in the direction of the magnetic field \textbf{B} := \text{curl} \hspace{0.6mm} \textbf{A}. We give a representation of the derivative of the SSF as a sum of the imaginary part of a holomorphic function and a harmonic measure related to the resonances of H_V. This representation warrant the Breit-Wigner approximation moreover we deduce information about the singularities of the SSF at the origin and a local trace formula.
