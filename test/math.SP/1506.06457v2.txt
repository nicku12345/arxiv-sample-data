Given two Hilbert spaces, \mathcal{H} and \mathcal{K}, we introduce an abstract unitary operator U on \mathcal{H} and its discriminant T on \mathcal{K} induced by a coisometry from \mathcal{H} to \mathcal{K} and a unitary involution on \mathcal{H}. In a particular case, these operators U and T become the evolution operator of the Szegedy walk on a graph, possibly infinite, and the transition probability operator thereon. We show the spectral mapping theorem between U and T via the Joukowsky transform. Using this result, we have completely detemined the spectrum of the Grover walk on the Sierpi\'nski lattice, which is pure point and has a Cantor-like structure.
