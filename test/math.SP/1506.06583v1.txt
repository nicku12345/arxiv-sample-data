Let S\subset\mathbb{R}^3 be a C^4-smooth relatively compact orientable surface with a sufficiently regular boundary. For \beta\in\mathbb{R}_+, let E_j(\beta) denote the jth negative eigenvalue of the operator associated with the quadratic form \[ H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)\ni u\mapsto \iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2dx -\beta \iint_S |u|^2d\sigma, \] where \sigma is the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure on S. We show that for each fixed j one has the asymptotic expansion \[ E_j(\beta)=-\dfrac{\beta^2}{4}+\mu^D_j+ o(1) \;\text{ as }\; \beta\to+\infty\,, \] where \mu_j^D is the jth eigenvalue of the operator -\Delta_S+K-M^2 on L^2(S), in which K and M are the Gauss and mean curvatures, respectively, and -\Delta_S is the Laplace-Beltrami operator with the Dirichlet condition at the boundary of S. If, in addition, the boundary of S is C^2-smooth, then the remainder estimate can be improved to {\mathcal O}(\beta^{-1}\log\beta).
