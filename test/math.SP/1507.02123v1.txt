We consider Schr\"odinger operators with a strongly attractive singular interaction supported by a finite curve \Gamma of lenghth L in \R^3. We show that if \Gamma is C^4-smooth and has regular endpoints, the j-th eigenvalue of such an operator has the asymptotic expansion \lambda_j (H_{\alpha,\Gamma})= \xi_\alpha +\lambda _j(S)+\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{e}^{\pi \alpha }) as the coupling parameter \alpha\to\infty, where \xi_\alpha = -4\,\mathrm{e}^{2(-2\pi\alpha +\psi(1))} and \lambda _j(S) is the j-th eigenvalue of the Schr\"odinger operator S=-\frac{\D^2}{\D s^2 }- \frac14 \gamma^2(s) on L^2(0,L) with Dirichlet condition at the interval endpoints in which \gamma is the curvature of \Gamma.
