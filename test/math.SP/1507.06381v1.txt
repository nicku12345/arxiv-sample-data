We establish new analytic and numerical results on a general class of rational operator Nevanlinna functions that arise e.g. in modelling photonic crystals. The capability of these dielectric nano-structured materials to control the flow of light depends on specific features of their eigenvalues. Our results provide a complete spectral analysis including variational principles and two-sided estimates for all eigenvalues along with numerical implementations. They even apply to multi-pole Lorentz models of permittivity functions and to the eigenvalues between the poles where classical min-max variational principles fail completely. In particular, we show that our abstract two-sided eigenvalue estimates are optimal and we derive explicit bounds on the band gap above a Lorentz pole. A high order finite element method is used to compute the two-sided estimates of a selection of eigenvalues for several concrete Lorentz models, e.g. polaritonic materials and multi-pole models.
