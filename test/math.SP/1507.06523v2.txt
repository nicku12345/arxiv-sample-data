We prove the existence of ballistic transport for the Schr\"odinger operator with limit-periodic or quasi-periodic potential in dimension two. This is done under certain regularity assumptions on the potential which have been used in prior work to establish the existence of an absolutely continuous component and other spectral properties. The latter include detailed information on the structure of generalized eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. These allow to establish the crucial ballistic lower bound through integration by parts on an appropriate extension of a Cantor set in momentum space, as well as through stationary phase arguments.
