In this note we explain the method how to find the resonance condition on quantum graphs, which is called pseudo orbit expansion. In three examples with standard coupling we show in detail how to obtain the resonance condition. We focus on non-Weyl graphs, i.e. the graphs which have fewer resonances than expected. For these graphs we explain benefits of the method of "deleting edges" for simplifying the graph.
