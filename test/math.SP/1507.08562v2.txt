We consider a position-dependent coined quantum walk on \mathbb{Z} and assume that the coin operator C(x) satisfies \[ \|C(x) - C_0 \| \leq c_1|x|^{-1-\epsilon},   \quad x \in \mathbb{Z} \] with positive c_1 and \epsilon and C_0 \in U(2). We show that the Heisenberg operator \hat x(t) of the position operator converges to the asymptotic velocity operator \hat v_+ so that \[ \mbox{s-}\lim_{t \to \infty} {\rm exp}\left( i \xi \frac{\hat x(t)}{t} \right)   = \Pi_{\rm p}(U) + {\rm exp}(i \xi \hat v_+) \Pi_{\rm ac}(U) \] provided that U has no singular continuous spectrum. Here \Pi_{\rm p}(U) (resp. \Pi_{\rm ac}(U)) is the orthogonal projection onto the direct sum of all eigenspaces (resp. the subspace of absolute continuity) of U. We also prove that for the random variable X_t denoting the position of a quantum walker at time t \in \mathbb{N}, X_t/t converges in law to a random variable V with the probability distribution \[ \mu_V = \|\Pi_{\rm p}(U)\Psi_0\|^2\delta_0   + \|E_{\hat v_+}(\cdot) \Pi_{\rm ac}(U)\Psi_0\|^2, \] where \Psi_0 is the initial state, \delta_0 the Dirac measure at zero, and E_{\hat v_+} the spectral measure of \hat v_+.
