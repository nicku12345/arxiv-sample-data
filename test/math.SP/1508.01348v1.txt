Let G be a connected, absolutely almost simple, algebraic group defined over a finitely generated, infinite field K, and let \Gamma be a Zariski dense subgroup of G(K). We show, apart from some few exceptions, that the commensurability class of the field \mathcal{F} given by the compositum of the splitting fields of characteristic polynomials of generic elements of \Gamma determines the group G upto isogeny over the algebraic closure of K.
