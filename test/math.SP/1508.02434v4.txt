The aim of this work is to explore the discrete spectrum generated by complex perturbations in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^3,\mathbb{C}^4) of the 3d Dirac operator \alpha \cdot (-i\nabla - \textbf{A}) + m \beta with variable magnetic field. Here, \alpha := (\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3) and \beta are 4 \times 4 Dirac matrices, and m > 0 is the mass of a particle. We give a simple criterion for the potentials to generate discrete spectrum near \pm m. In the case of creation of non-real eigenvalues, this criterion gives also their location.
