We consider a family of one frequency discrete analytic quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators which appear in [Bjer]. We show that this family provides an example of coexistence of absolutely continuous and point spectrum for some parameters as well as coexistence of absolutely continuous and singular continuous spectrum for some other parameters.
