For two self-adjoint operators H,A we show that a general commutation relation of type [H,\mathrm{i}A]=Q(H)+K, in addition to regularity of H and Kato-smoothness of K, guarantee pointwise in time decay rates of diverse order. The methodology is based on the construction of a modified conjugate operator \tilde{A} that reduces the problem to previously developed estimates when K=0. Our results apply to energy thresholds and do not rely on resolvent estimates. We discuss applications for the Schr\"odinger equation (SE) with potential of critical decay, and for the free SE on an asymptotically flat manifold.
