Let \Lambda\subset\mathbb{R}^2 be a non-closed piecewise-C^1 curve, which is either bounded with two free endpoints or unbounded with one free endpoint. Let u_\pm|_\Lambda \in L^2(\Lambda) be the traces of a function u in the Sobolev space H^1({\mathbb R}^2\setminus \Lambda) onto two faces of \Lambda. We prove that for a wide class of shapes of \Lambda the Schr\"odinger operator \mathsf{H}_\omega^\Lambda with \delta^\prime-interaction supported on \Lambda of strength \omega \in L^\infty(\Lambda;\mathbb{R}) associated with the quadratic form \[ H^1(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\Lambda)\ni u \mapsto \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}\big|\nabla u \big|^2 \mathsf{d} x   - \int_\Lambda \omega \big| u_+|_\Lambda - u_-|_\Lambda \big|^2 \mathsf{d} s \] has no negative spectrum provided that \omega is pointwise majorized by a strictly positive function explicitly expressed in terms of \Lambda. If, additionally, the domain \mathbb{R}^2\setminus\Lambda is quasi-conical, we show that \sigma(\mathsf{H}_\omega^\Lambda) = [0,+\infty). For a bounded curve \Lambda in our class and non-varying interaction strength \omega\in\mathbb{R} we derive existence of a constant \omega_* > 0 such that \sigma(\mathsf{H}_\omega^\Lambda) = [0,+\infty) for all \omega \in (-\infty, \omega_*]; informally speaking, bound states are absent in the weak coupling regime.
