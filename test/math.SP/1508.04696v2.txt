We consider Schr\"odinger operators on the real line with limit-periodic potentials and show that, generically, the spectrum is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure and all spectral measures are purely singular continuous. Moreover, we show that for a dense set of limit-periodic potentials, the spectrum of the associated Schr\"odinger operator has Hausdorff dimension zero. In both results one can introduce a coupling constant \lambda \in (0,\infty), and the respective statement then holds simultaneously for all values of the coupling constant.
