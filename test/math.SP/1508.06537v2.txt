In this paper we present how spectral properties of certain linear operators vary when operators are considered in different Hilbert spaces having common dense domain as the space of polynomials in one real variable with complex coefficients. This is done taking differential operator and matrix operator representation of dilation operator E_{p,d} dilating p, a polynomial sequence, by d, a non-constant sequence of non-zero complex scalars. For the purpose of identification of E_{p,d} with formal differential operator, which includes finite order differential operators as special cases, we derive conditions under which a formal differential operator has a polynomial sequence as a sequence of eigen functions corresponding to non-zero eigen values. As a consequence we get, for instance,    ((1/72)x^4-3x) y^{(4)}-x y^{(2)}-(1/3)x y^{(1)} + (4/3)y. does not have any polynomial sequence as such a sequence of eigen functions, since no fourth order polynomial is such an eigen svector.
