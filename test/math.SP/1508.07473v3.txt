We consider an abstract quantum walk defined by a unitary evolution operator U, which acts on a Hilbert space decomposed into a direct sum of Hilbert spaces \{\mathcal{H}_v \}_{v \in V}. We show that such U naturally defines a directed graph G_U and the probability of finding a quantum walker on G_U. The asymptotic property of an abstract quantum walker is governed by the generator H of U such that U^n = e^{inH}. We derive the generator of an evolution of the form U = S(2d_A^* d_A -1), a generalization of the Szegedy evolution operator. Here d_A is a boundary operator and S a shift operator.
