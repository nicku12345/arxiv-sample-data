We consider the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation -f"+q_\kappa f = Ef on the positive half-axis with the potential q_\kappa(r)=(\kappa^2-1/4)r^{-2}. For each complex number \vartheta, we construct a solution u^\kappa_\vartheta(E) of this equation that is analytic in \kappa in a complex neighborhood of the interval (-1,1) and, in particular, at the "singular" point \kappa = 0. For -1<\kappa<1 and real \vartheta, the solutions u^\kappa_\vartheta(E) determine a unitary eigenfunction expansion operator U_{\kappa,\vartheta}\colon L_2(0,\infty)\to L_2(\mathbb R,\mathcal V_{\kappa,\vartheta}), where \mathcal V_{\kappa,\vartheta} is a positive measure on \mathbb R. We show that every self-adjoint realization of the formal differential expression -\partial^2_r + q_\kappa(r) for the Hamiltonian is diagonalized by the operator U_{\kappa,\vartheta} for some \vartheta\in\mathbb R. Using suitable singular Titchmarsh-Weyl m-functions, we explicitly find the measures \mathcal V_{\kappa,\vartheta} and prove their continuity in \kappa and \vartheta.
