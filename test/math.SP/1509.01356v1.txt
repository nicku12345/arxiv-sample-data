Using the general formalism of [12], a study of index theory for non-Fredholm operators was initiated in [9]. Natural examples arise from (1+1)-dimensional differential operators using the model operator D_A in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2; dt dx) of the type D_A = (d/dt) + A, where A = \int^{\oplus}_{\mathbb{R}} dt \, A(t), and the family of self-adjoint operators A(t) in L^2(\mathbb{R}; dx) is explicitly given by A(t) = - i (d/dx) + \theta(t) \phi(\cdot), t \in \mathbb{R}. Here \phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} has to be integrable on \mathbb{R} and \theta: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} tends to zero as t \to - \infty and to 1 as t \to + \infty. In particular, A(t) has asymptotes in the norm resolvent sense A_- = - i (d/dx), A_+ = - i (d/dx) + \phi(\cdot) as t \to \mp \infty.   Since D_A violates the relative trace class condition introduced in [9], we now employ a new approach based on an approximation technique. The approximants do fit the framework of [9] and lead to the following results: Introducing H_1 = {D_A}^* D_A, H_2 = D_A {D_A}^*, we recall that the resolvent regularized Witten index of D_A, denoted by W_r(D_A), is defined by  W_r(D_A) = \lim_{\lambda \to 0} (- \lambda) {\rm tr}_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2; dtdx)}((H_1 - \lambda I)^{-1} - (H_2 - \lambda I)^{-1}).  In the concrete example at hand, we prove  W_r(D_A) = \xi(0_+; H_2, H_1) = \xi(0; A_+, A_-) = 1/(2 \pi) \int_{\mathbb{R}} dx \, \phi(x).  Here \xi(\, \cdot \, ; S_2, S_1), denotes the spectral shift operator for the pair (S_2,S_1), and we employ the normalization, \xi(\lambda; H_2, H_1) = 0, \lambda < 0.
