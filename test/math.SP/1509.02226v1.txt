We establish Anderson localization for quasiperiodic operator families of the form      (H(x)\psi)(m)=\psi(m+1)+\psi(m-1)+\lambda v(x+m\alpha)\psi(m)    for all \lambda>0 and all Diophantine \alpha, provided that v is a 1-periodic function satisfying a Lipschitz monotonicity condition on [0,1). The localization is uniform on any energy interval on which Lyapunov exponent is bounded from below.
