We study resonances of compactly supported potentials  V_\varepsilon = W ( x, x/\varepsilon )  where  W : \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d / ( 2\pi \mathbb{Z}) ^d \to \mathbb{C} ,  d  odd. That means that  V_\varepsilon  is a sum of a slowly varying potential,  W_0 ( x) , and one oscillating at frequency 1/\varepsilon. For  W_0 \equiv 0  we prove that there are no resonances above the line \text{Im} \lambda = -A \ln(\varepsilon^{-1}), except possibly a simple resonance of modulus \sim \varepsilon^2, when  d=1. We show that this result is optimal by constructing a one-dimensional example. In the case when  W_0 \neq 0  we prove that resonances in fixed strips admit an expansion in powers of \varepsilon. The argument provides a method for computing the coefficients of the expansion. In particular we produce an effective potential converging uniformly to W_0 as \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 and whose resonances approach resonances of V_\varepsilon modulo O(\varepsilon^4).
