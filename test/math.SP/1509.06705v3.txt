We study the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a convex domain in \mathbb{R}^n, with n\geq 2. In particular, we generalize and improve upper bounds for the Riesz means of order \sigma\geq 3/2 established in an article by Geisinger, Laptev and Weidl. This is achieved by refining estimates for a negative second term in the Berezin inequality. The obtained remainder term reflects the correct order of growth in the semi-classical limit and depends only on the measure of the boundary of the domain. We emphasize that such an improvement is for general \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n not possible and was previously known to hold only for planar convex domains satisfying certain geometric conditions.   As a corollary we obtain lower bounds for the individual eigenvalues \lambda_k, which for a certain range of k improves the Li--Yau inequality for convex domains. However, for convex domains one can use different methods to obtain even stronger such lower bounds.
