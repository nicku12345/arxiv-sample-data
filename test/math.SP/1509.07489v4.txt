Let f be an L^2-normalized Hecke--Maass cuspidal newform of level N, character \chi and Laplace eigenvalue \lambda. Let N_1 denote the smallest integer such that N|N_1^2 and N_0 denote the largest integer such that N_0^2 |N. Let M denote the conductor of \chi and define M_1= M/\gcd(M,N_1). In this paper, we prove the bound |f|_\infty \ll_{\epsilon} N_0^{1/6 + \epsilon} N_1^{1/3+\epsilon} M_1^{1/2} \lambda^{5/24+\epsilon}, which generalizes and strengthens previously known upper bounds for |f|_\infty.   This is the first time a hybrid bound (i.e., involving both N and \lambda) has been established for |f|_\infty in the case of non-squarefree N. The only previously known bound in the non-squarefree case was in the N-aspect; it had been shown by the author that |f|_\infty \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} N^{5/12+\epsilon} provided M=1. The present result significantly improves the exponent of N in the above case. If N is a squarefree integer, our bound reduces to |f|_\infty \ll_\epsilon N^{1/3 + \epsilon}\lambda^{5/24 + \epsilon}, which was previously proved by Templier.   The key new feature of the present work is a systematic use of p-adic representation theoretic techniques and in particular a detailed study of Whittaker newforms and matrix coefficients for GL_2(F) where F is a local field.
