We investigate the spectrum of the self-similar Laplacian, which generates the so-called "pq random walk" on the integer half-line \mathbb{Z}_+. Using the method of spectral decimation, we prove that the spectral type of the Laplacian is singularly continuous whenever p\neq \frac{1}{2}. This serves as a toy model for generating singularly continuous spectrum, which can be generalized to more complicated settings. We hope it will provide more insight into Fibonacci and other weakly self-similar models.
