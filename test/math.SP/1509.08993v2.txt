We give a brief literature review of the isoperimetric problem and discuss its relationship with the Cheeger constant of Riemannian n-manifolds. For some non-compact, finite area 2-manifolds, we prove the existence and regularity of subsets whose isoperimetric ratio is equal to the Cheeger constant. To do this, we use results of Hass-Morgan for the isoperimetric problem of these manifolds. We also give an example of a finite area 2-manifold where no such subset exists. Using work of Adams-Morgan, we classify all such subsets of geometrically finite hyperbolic surfaces where such subsets always exist. From this, we provide an algorithm for finding these sets given information about the topology, length spectrum, and distances between the simple closed geodesics of the surface. Finding such a subset allows one to directly compute the Cheeger constant of the surface. As an application of this work suggested by Agol, we give a test for Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture. We do this by comparing a quantitative improvement of Buser's inequality resulting from works of both Agol and the author to an upper bound on the Cheeger constant of these surfaces, the latter given by Brooks-Zuk. As expected, our test does not contradict Selberg's conjecture.
