We address the Laplacian on a perturbed periodic graph which might not be a periodic graph. We present a class of perturbed graphs for which the essential spectra of the Laplacians are stable even when the graphs are perturbed by adding and removing infinitely many vertices and edges. Using this result, we demonstrate how to determine the spectra of cone-like graphs, the upper-half plane, and graphs obtained from \mathbb{Z}^2 by randomly adding vertices.
