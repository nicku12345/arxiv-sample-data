We investigate Weyl type asymptotics of functional-difference operators associated to mirror curves of special del Pezzo Calabi-Yau threefolds. These operators are H(\zeta)=U+U^{-1}+V+\zeta V^{-1} and H_{m,n}=U+V+q^{-mn}U^{-m}V^{-n}, where U and V are self-adjoint Weyl operators satisfying UV=q^{2}VU with q=e^{i\pi b^{2}}, b>0 and \zeta>0, m,n\in\mathbb{N}. We prove that H(\zeta) and H_{m,n} are self-adjoint operators with purely discrete spectrum on L^{2}(\mathbb{R}). Using the coherent state transform we find the asymptotical behaviour for the Riesz mean \sum_{j\ge 1}(\lambda-\lambda_{j})_{+} as \lambda\to\infty and prove the Weyl law for the eigenvalue counting function N(\lambda) for these operators, which imply that their inverses are of trace class.
