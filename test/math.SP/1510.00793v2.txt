Procedures to recover explicitly discrete and continuous skew-selfadjoint Dirac systems on semi-axis from rational Weyl matrix functions are considered. Their stability is shown. Some new facts on asymptotics of pseudo-exponential potentials (i.e., of explicit solutions of inverse problems) are proved as well. GBDT version of Backlund-Darboux transformation, methods from system theory and results on algebraic Riccati equations are used for this purpose.
