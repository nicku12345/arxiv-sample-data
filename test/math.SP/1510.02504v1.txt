In this paper, A. Avila's theorem on convergence of the exact quantization scheme of A. Voros is related to the reality proofs of eigenvalues of certain PT-symmetric boundary value problems. As a result, a special case of a conjecture of C. Bender, S. Boettcher and P. Meisinger on reality of eigenvalues is proved.
