We discuss the eigenvalues E_j of Schr\"odinger operators -\Delta+V in L^2(\mathbb R^d) with complex potentials V\in L^p, p<\infty. We show that (A) \mathrm{Re} E_j\to\infty implies \mathrm{Im} E_j\to 0, and (B) \mathrm{Re} E_j\to E\in [0,\infty) implies (\mathrm{Im} E_j)\in\ell^q for some q depending on p. We prove quantitative versions of (A) and (B) in terms of the L^p-norm of V.
