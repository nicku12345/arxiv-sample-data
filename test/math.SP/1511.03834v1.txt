We consider discrete Schr\"odinger operators with pattern Sturmian potentials. This class of potentials strictly contains the class of Sturmian potentials, for which the spectral properties of the associated Schr\"odinger operators are well understood. In particular, it is known that for every Sturmian potential, the associated Schr\"odinger operator has zero-measure spectrum and purely singular continuous spectral measures. We conjecture that the same statements hold in the more general class of pattern Sturmian potentials. We prove partial results in support of this conjecture. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for all pattern Sturmian potentials that belong to the family of Toeplitz sequences.
