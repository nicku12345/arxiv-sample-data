We consider asymptotic behavior of e^{-itH}f for N-body Schr\"odinger operator H=H_0+\sum_{1\le i<j\le N}V_{ij}(x) with long- and short-range pair potentials V_{ij}(x)=V_{ij}^L(x)+V_{ij}^S(x) (x\in {\mathbb R}^\nu) such that \partial_x^\alpha V_{ij}^L(x)=O(|x|^{-\delta-|\alpha|}) and V_{ij}^S(x)=O(|x|^{-1-\delta}) (|x|\to\infty) with \delta>0. Introducing the concept of scattering spaces which classify the initial states f according to the asymptotic behavior of the evolution e^{-itH}f, we give a generalized decomposition theorem of the continuous spectral subspace {\mathcal{H}}_c(H) of H. The asymptotic completeness of wave operators is proved for some long-range pair potentials with \delta>1/2 by using this decomposition theorem under some assumption on subsystem eigenfunctions.
