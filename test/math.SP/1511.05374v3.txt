This paper investigates the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to certain infinite systems of ordinary differential equations. In particular, we use results from ergodic theory and the asymptotic theory of C_0-semigroups to obtain a characterisation, in terms of convergence of certain Ces\`aro averages, of those initial values which lead to convergent solutions. Moreover, we obtain estimates on the rate of convergence for solutions whose initial values satisfy a stronger ergodic condition. These results rely on a detailed spectral analysis of the operator describing the system, which is made possible by certain structural assumptions on the operator. The resulting class of systems is sufficiently broad to cover a number of important applications, including in particular both the so-called robot rendezvous problem and an important class of platoon systems arising in control theory. Our method leads to new results in both cases.
