In this paper, we give a description of the spectrum of a class of non-selfadjoint perturbations of selfadjoint operators in dimension one and we show that it is given by Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions. To achieve this, we make use of previous work by Michael Hitrik, Anders Melin and Johannes Sj{\"o}strand. We also give an application of our result in the case of PT-symmetric pseudo-differential operators.
