Given a Schr\"odinger differential expression on an exterior Lipschitz domain we prove strict inequalities between the eigenvalues of the corresponding selfadjoint operators subject to Dirichlet and Neumann or Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, respectively. Moreover, we prove a strict inequality between the eigenvalues of two different elliptic differential operators on the same domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
