We study spectral properties of Schr\"odinger operators with \delta-interactions on a semi-axis by using the theory of boundary triplets and the corresponding Weyl functions. We establish a connection between spectral properties (deficiency indices, self-adjointness, semiboundedness, discreteness of spectra, resolvent comparability etc.) of Schr\"odinger operators with point interactions and a special class of block Jacobi matrices.
