Given an Euclidean domain with very mild regularity properties, we prove that there exist perturbations of the Dirichlet Laplacian of the form -(I+S_\epsilon)\Delta with \|S_\epsilon\|_{L^2\to L^2}\leq \epsilon whose high energy eigenfunctions are quantum uniquely ergodic (QUE). Moreover, if we impose stronger regularity on the domain, the same result holds with \|S_\epsilon\|_{L^2\to H^\gamma}\leq \epsilon for \gamma>0 depending on the domain. We also give a proof of a local Weyl law for domains with rough boundaries.
