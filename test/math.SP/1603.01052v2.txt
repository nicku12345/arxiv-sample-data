We perform the spectral analysis of a family of Jacobi operators J(\alpha) depending on a complex parameter \alpha. If |\alpha|\neq1 the spectrum of J(\alpha) is discrete and formulas for eigenvalues and eigenvectors are established in terms of elliptic integrals and Jacobian elliptic functions. If |\alpha|=1, \alpha \neq \pm 1, the essential spectrum of J(\alpha) covers the entire complex plane. In addition, a formula for the Weyl m-function as well as the asymptotic expansions of solutions of the difference equation corresponding to J(\alpha) are obtained. Finally, the completeness of eigenvectors and Rodriguez-like formulas for orthogonal polynomials, studied previously by Carlitz, are proved.
