We study Jacobi matrices that are uniformly approximated by periodic operators. We show that if the rate of approximation is sufficiently rapid, then the associated quantum dynamics are ballistic in a rather strong sense; namely, the (normalized) Heisenberg evolution of the position operator converges strongly to a self-adjoint operator that is injective on the space of absolutely summable sequences. In particular, this means that all transport exponents corresponding to well-localized initial states are equal to one. Our result may be applied to a class of quantum many-body problems. Specifically, we establish a lower bound on the Lieb--Robinson velocity for an isotropic XY spin chain on the integers with limit-periodic couplings.
