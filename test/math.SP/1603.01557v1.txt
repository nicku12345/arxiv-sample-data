For n\in\{2,3\} we prove minimax characterisations of eigenvalues in the gap of the n dimensional Dirac operator with an potential, which may have a Coulomb singularity with a coupling constant up to the critical value 1/(4-n). This result implies a so-called Hardy-Dirac inequality, which can be used to define a distinguished self-adjoint extension of the Coulomb-Dirac operator defined on \mathsf{C}_{0}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\};\mathbb{C}^{2(n-1)}), as long as the coupling constant does not exceed 1/(4-n). We also find an explicit description of an operator core of this operator.
