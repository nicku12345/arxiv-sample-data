We study spectral properties of convolution operators \mathcal L and their perturbations H=\mathcal L+v(x) by compactly supported potentials. Results are applied to determine the front propagation of a population density governed by operator H with a compactly supported initial density provided that H has positive eigenvalues. If there is no positive spectrum, then the stabilization of the population density is proved.
