For any finite link L in \mathbb{R}^3 we prove the existence of a high-energy complex-valued eigenfunction of the hydrogen atom such that its nodal set contains a union of connected components diffeomorphic to L. This problem goes back to Berry, who constructed such eigenfunctions in the case where L is the trefoil knot or the Hopf link and asked the question about the general result.
