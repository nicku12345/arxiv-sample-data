The classical sampling Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov theorem states that a band-limited continuous time function can be uniquely recovered without error from a infinite two-sided sampling series taken with a sufficient frequency. This short note shows that the function can be recovered from any one-sided semi-infinite half of any oversampling series, with the same boundary for admissible frequencies as in the classical theorem.
