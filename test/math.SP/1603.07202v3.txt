We investigate the influence of an electric field on trapped modes arising in a two-dimensional curved quantum waveguide {\bf \Omega} i.e. bound states of the corresponding Laplace operator -\Delta\_{{\bf \Omega}}. Here the curvature of the guide is supposed to satisfy some assumptions of analyticity, and decays as O(|s|^{-\varepsilon}), \varepsilon > 3 at infinity. We show that under conditions on the electric field  \bf F, {\bf H}(F):= -\Delta\_{{\bf \Omega}} + {\bf F}. {\bf x}  has resonances near the discrete eigenvalues of -\Delta\_{{\bf \Omega}}.
