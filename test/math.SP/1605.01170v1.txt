For an arbitrary open, nonempty, bounded set \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \in \mathbb{N}, and sufficiently smooth coefficients a,b,q, we consider the closed, strictly positive, higher-order differential operator A_{\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q) in L^2(\Omega) defined on W_0^{2m,2}(\Omega), associated with the higher-order differential expression  \tau_{2m} (a,b,q) := \bigg(\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} (-i \partial_j - b_j) a_{j,k} (-i \partial_k - b_k)+q\bigg)^m, \quad m \in \mathbb{N},  and its Krein--von Neumann extension A_{K, \Omega, 2m} (a,b,q) in L^2(\Omega). Denoting by N(\lambda; A_{K, \Omega, 2m} (a,b,q)), \lambda > 0, the eigenvalue counting function corresponding to the strictly positive eigenvalues of A_{K, \Omega, 2m} (a,b,q), we derive the bound  N(\lambda; A_{K, \Omega, 2m} (a,b,q)) \leq C v_n (2\pi)^{-n} \bigg(1+\frac{2m}{2m+n}\bigg)^{n/(2m)} \lambda^{n/(2m)} , \quad \lambda > 0,  where C = C(a,b,q,\Omega)>0 (with C(I_n,0,0,\Omega) = |\Omega|) is connected to the eigenfunction expansion of the self-adjoint operator \widetilde A_{2m} (a,b,q) in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) defined on W^{2m,2}(\mathbb{R}^n), corresponding to \tau_{2m} (a,b,q). Here v_n := \pi^{n/2}/\Gamma((n+2)/2) denotes the (Euclidean) volume of the unit ball in \mathbb{R}^n.   Our method of proof relies on variational considerations exploiting the fundamental link between the Krein--von Neumann extension and an underlying abstract buckling problem, and on the distorted Fourier transform defined in terms of the eigenfunction transform of \widetilde A_{2} (a,b,q) in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n).   We also consider the analogous bound for the eigenvalue counting function for the Friedrichs extension A_{F,\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q) in L^2(\Omega) of A_{\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q).   No assumptions on the boundary \partial \Omega of \Omega are made.
