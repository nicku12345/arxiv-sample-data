We consider resonances for third order ordinary differential operator with compactly supported coefficients on the real line. Resonance are defined as zeros of a Fredholm determinant on a non-physical sheet of three sheeted Riemann surface. We determine upper bounds of the number of resonances in complex discs at large radius. We express the trace formula in terms of resonances only.
