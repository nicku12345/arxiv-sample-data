We consider non-self-adjoint electromagnetic Schr\"odinger operators on arbitrary open sets with complex scalar potentials whose real part is not necessarily bounded from below. Under a suitable sufficient condition on the electromagnetic potential, we introduce a Dirichlet realisation as a closed densely defined operator with non-empty resolvent set and show that the eigenfunctions corresponding to discrete eigenvalues satisfy an Agmon-type exponential decay.
