Let u be a harmonic function in the unit ball B(0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 3, such that u(0)=0. Nadirashvili conjectured that there exists a positive constant c, depending on the dimension n only, such that H^{n-1}(\{u=0 \}\cap B) \geq c. We prove Nadirashvili's conjecture as well as its counterpart on C^\infty-smooth Riemannian manifolds. The latter yields the lower bound in Yau's conjecture. Namely, we show that for any compact C^\infty-smooth Riemannian manifold M (without boundary) of dimension n there exists c>0 such that for any Laplace eigenfunction \varphi_\lambda on M, which corresponds to the eigenvalue \lambda, the following inequality holds: c \sqrt \lambda \leq H^{n-1}(\{\varphi_\lambda =0\}).
