Let \Delta_M be the Laplace operator on a compact n-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary. We study the zero sets of its eigenfunctions u:\Delta u + \lambda u =0. In dimension n=2 we refine the Donnelly-Fefferman estimate by showing that H^1(\{u=0 \})\le C\lambda^{3/4-\beta}, \beta \in (0,1/4). The proof employs the Donnelli-Fefferman estimate and a combinatorial argument, which also gives a lower (non-sharp) bound in dimension n=3: H^2(\{u=0\})\ge c\lambda^\alpha, \alpha \in (0,1/2). The positive constants c,C depend on the manifold, \alpha and \beta are universal.
