Using analytic properties of Blaschke factors we construct a family of analytic hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of the torus for which the spectral properties of the associated transfer operator acting on a suitable Hilbert space can be computed explicitly. As a result, we obtain explicit expressions for the decay of correlations of analytic observables without resorting to any kind of perturbation argument.
