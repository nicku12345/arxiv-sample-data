We provide a limiting absorption principle for the self-adjoint realizations of Laplace operators corresponding to boundary conditions on (relatively open parts \Sigma of) compact hypersurfaces \Gamma=\partial\Omega, \Omega\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n}. For any of such self-adjoint operators we also provide the generalized eigenfunctions and the scattering matrix; both these objects are written in terms of operator-valued Weyl functions. We make use of a Krein-type formula which provides the resolvent difference between the operator corresponding to self-adjoint boundary conditions on the hypersurface and the free Laplacian on the whole space {\mathbb{R}}^{n}. Our results apply to all standard examples of boundary conditions, like Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, \delta and \delta'-type, either assigned on \Gamma or on \Sigma\subset\Gamma.
