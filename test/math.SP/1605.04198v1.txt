We consider skew products T_\phi:X\times G\to X\times G,~~(x,g)\mapsto(F_1(x),g\;\!\phi(x)), where X is a compact manifold with probability measure, G a compact Lie group with Lie algebra \frak g, F_1:X\to X the time-one map of a measure-preserving flow, and \phi\in C^1(X,G) a cocycle. Then, we define the degree of \phi as a suitable function P_\phi M_\phi:X\to\frak g, we show that it transforms in a natural way under Lie group homomorphisms and under the relation of C^1-cohomology, and we explain how it generalises previous definitions of degree of a cocycle. For each finite-dimensional irreducible representation \pi of G, and \frak g_\pi the Lie algebra of \pi(G), we define in an analogous way the degree of \pi\circ\phi as a suitable function P_{\pi\circ\phi}M_{\pi\circ\phi}:X\to\frak g_\pi. If F_1 is uniquely ergodic and the functions \pi\circ\phi diagonal, or if T_\phi is uniquely ergodic, then the degree of \phi reduces to a constant in \frak g given by an integral over X. As a by-product, we obtain that there is no uniquely ergodic skew product T_\phi with nonzero degree if G is a connected semisimple compact Lie group.   Next, we show that T_\phi is mixing in the orthocomplement of the kernel of P_{\pi\circ\phi}M_{\pi\circ\phi}, and under some additional assumptions we show that U_\phi has purely absolutely continuous spectrum in that orthocomplement if (iP_{\pi\circ\phi}M_{\pi\circ\phi})^2 is strictly positive. Summing up these results for each \pi, one obtains a global result for the mixing and the absolutely continuous spectrum of T_\phi. As an application, we present four explicit cases: when G is a torus, G=SU(2), G=SO(3,\mathbb R), and G=U(2). In each case, the results we obtain are new, or generalise previous results.   Our proofs rely on new results on positive commutator methods for unitary operators.
