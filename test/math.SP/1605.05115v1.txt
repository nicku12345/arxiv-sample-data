In this paper, we study an inverse scattering problem at fixed energy on three-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic St{\"a}ckel manifolds having the topology of toric cylinders and satisfying the Robertson condition. On these manifolds the Helmholtz equation can be separated into a system of a radial ODE and two angular ODEs. We can thus decompose the full scattering operator onto generalized harmonics and the resulting partial scattering matrices consist in a countable set of 2 \times 2 matrices whose coefficients are the so-called transmission and reflection coefficients. It is shown that the reflection coefficients are nothing but generalized Weyl-Titchmarsh functions associated with the radial ODE. Using a novel multivariable version of the Complex Angular Momentum method, we show that the knowledge of the scattering operator at a fixed non-zero energy is enough to determine uniquely the metric of the three-dimensional St{\"a}ckel manifold up to natural obstructions.
