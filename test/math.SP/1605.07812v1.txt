In this note we investigate spectral properties of a periodic waveguide \Omega^\varepsilon (\varepsilon is a small parameter) obtained from a straight strip by attaching an array of \varepsilon-periodically distributed identical protuberances having "room-and-passage" geometry. In the current work we consider the operator \mathcal{A}^\varepsilon=-\rho^\varepsilon\Delta_{\Omega^\varepsilon}, where \Delta_{\Omega^\varepsilon} is the Neumann Laplacian in \Omega^\varepsilon, the weight \rho^\varepsilon is equal to 1 everywhere except the union of the "rooms". We will prove that the spectrum of \mathcal{A}^\varepsilon has at least one gap as \varepsilon is small enough provided certain conditions on the weight \rho^\varepsilon and the sizes of attached protuberances hold.
