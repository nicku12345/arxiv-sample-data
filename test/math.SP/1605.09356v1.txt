We study Schr\"odinger operators H=-\Delta+V in L^2(\Omega) where \Omega is \mathbb R^d or the half-space \mathbb R_+^d, subject to (real) Robin boundary conditions in the latter case. For p>d we construct a non-real potential V\in L^p(\Omega)\cap L^{\infty}(\Omega) that decays at infinity so that H has infinitely many non-real eigenvalues accumulating at every point of the essential spectrum \sigma_{\rm ess}(H)=[0,\infty). This demonstrates that the Lieb-Thirring inequalities for selfadjoint Schr\"odinger operators are no longer true in the non-selfadjoint case.
