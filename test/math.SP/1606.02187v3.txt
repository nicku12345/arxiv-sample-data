Let M be a compact smooth manifold equipped with a positive smooth density \mu and H be a smooth distribution endowed with a fiberwise inner product g. We define the Laplacian \Delta_H associated with (H,\mu,g) and prove that it gives rise to an unbounded self-adjoint operator in L^2(M,\mu). Then, assuming that H generates a singular foliation \mathcal F, we prove that, for any function \varphi from the Schwartz space \mathcal S(\mathbb R), the operator \varphi(\Delta_H) is a smoothing operator in the scale of longitudinal Sobolev spaces associated with \mathcal F. The proofs are based on pseudodifferential calculus on singular foliations developed by Androulidakis and Skandalis and subelliptic estimates for \Delta_H.
