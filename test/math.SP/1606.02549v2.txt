We prove local and global energy decay for the wave equation in a wave guide with damping at infinity. More precisely, the absorption index is assumed to converge slowly to a positive constant, and we obtain the diffusive phenomenon typical for the contribution of low frequencies when the damping is effective at infinity. On the other hand, the usual Geometric Control Condition is not necessarily satisfied so we may have a loss of regularity for the contribution of high frequencies. Since our results are new even in the Euclidean space, we also state a similar result in this case.
