We estimate the probability of a photon to move faster than light, under the Einstein dynamics which, unlike the wave equation or Maxwell wave dynamics, has singular dispersion relation at zero momentum. We show that this probability goes to zero with time, using propagation estimates suitably multi-scaled to control the contribution of low frequencies. We then prove minimal velocity bounds
