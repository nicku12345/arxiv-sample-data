We briefly review the diffraction of quasicrystals and then give an elementary alternative proof of the diffraction formula for regular cut-and-project sets, which is based on Bochner's theorem from Fourier analysis. This clarifies a common view that the diffraction of a quasicrystal is determined by the diffraction of its underlying lattice. To illustrate our approach, we will also treat a number of well-known explicitly solvable examples.
