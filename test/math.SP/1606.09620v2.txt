Let \Lambda\subset \mathbb{R}^d be a domain consisting of several cylinders attached to a bounded center. One says that \Lambda admits a threshold resonance if there exists a non-trivial bounded function u solving -\Delta u=\nu u in \Lambda and vanishing at the boundary, where \nu is the bottom of the essential spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian in \Lambda. We derive a sufficient condition for the absence of threshold resonances in terms of the Laplacian eigenvalues on the center. The proof is elementary and is based on the min-max principle. Some two- and three-dimensional examples and applications to the study of Laplacians on thin networks are discussed.
