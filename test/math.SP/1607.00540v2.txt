We consider the self-adjoint Smilansky Hamiltonian \mathsf{H}_\varepsilon in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2) associated with the formal differential expression -\partial_x^2 - \frac12\big(\partial_y^2 + y^2) - \sqrt{2}\varepsilon y \delta(x) in the sub-critical regime, \varepsilon \in (0,1). We demonstrate the existence of resonances for \mathsf{H}_\varepsilon on a countable subfamily of sheets of the underlying Riemann surface whose distance from the physical sheet is finite. On such sheets, we find resonance free regions and characterise resonances for small \varepsilon > 0. In addition, we refine the previously known results on the bound states of \mathsf{H}_\varepsilon in the weak coupling regime (\varepsilon\rightarrow 0+). In the proofs we use Birman-Schwinger principle for \mathsf{H}_\varepsilon, elements of spectral theory for Jacobi matrices, and the analytic implicit function theorem.
