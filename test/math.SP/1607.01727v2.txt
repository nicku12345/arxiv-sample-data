The purpose of this paper is to study spectral properties of non-self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators -\Delta-\frac{(n-2)^2}{4|x|^{2}}+V on \mathbb{R}^n with complex-valued potentials V\in L^{p,\infty}, p>n/2. We prove Keller type inequalities which measure the radius of a disc containing the discrete spectrum, in terms of the L^{p,\infty} norm of V. Similar inequalities also hold if the inverse-square potential is replaced by a large class of subcritical potentials with critical singularities at the origin. The main new ingredient in the proof is the uniform Sobolev inequality of Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge type for Schr\"odinger operators with strongly singular potentials, which is of independent interest.
