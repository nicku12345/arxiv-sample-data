We consider upper bounds on the growth of L^p norms of restrictions of eigenfunctions and quasimodes to geodesic segments in a nonpositively curved manifold in the high frequency limit. This sharpens results of Chen and Sogge as well as Xi and Zhang, which showed that the crux of the problem is to establish bounds on the mixed partials of the distance function on the covering manifold restricted to geodesic segments. The innovation in this work is the development of a formula for the third variation of arc length on the covering manifold, which allows for a coordinate free expressions of these mixed partials.
