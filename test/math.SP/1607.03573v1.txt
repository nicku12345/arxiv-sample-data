In this paper we investigate the spectral and the scattering theory of Schr\"odinger operators acting on perturbed periodic discrete graphs. The perturbations considered are of two types: either a multiplication operator by a short-range or a long-range function, or a short-range type modification of the measure defined on the vertices and on the edges of the graph. Mourre theory is used for describing the nature of the spectrum of the underlying operators. For short-range perturbations, existence and completeness of local wave operators are also proved.
