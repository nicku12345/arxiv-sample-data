We discuss the asymptotic lower bound on the inner radius of nodal domains that arise from Laplacian eigenfunctions  \phi_\lambda  on a closed Riemannian manifold  (M,g) . First, in the real-analytic case we present an improvement of the currently best known bounds, due to Mangoubi (\cite{Man1}). Furthermore, using recent results of Hezari (\cite{Hezari}, \cite{Hezari2}) we obtain  \log -type improvements in the case of negative curvature and improved bounds for  (M,g)  possessing an ergodic geodesic flow. Second, we discuss the relation between the distribution of the  L^2  norm of an eigenfunction  \phi_\lambda  and the inner radius of the corresponding nodal domains. In the spirit of the works of Colding-Minicozzi and Jakobson-Mangoubi, we consider a covering of good cubes and show that, if a nodal domain is sufficiently well covered by good cubes, then its inner radius is large.
