The kinetic Brownian motion on the cosphere bundle of a Riemannian manifold \mathbb{M} is a stochastic process that models the geodesic equation perturbed by a random white force of size \varepsilon. When \mathbb{M} is compact with negative curvature we show that the L^2-spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of this process converges to the Pollicott--Ruelle resonances of \mathbb{M} as \varepsilon \rightarrow 0.
