In this work, we prove a bound on multiplicity of the singular spectrum for certain class of Anderson Hamiltonians. The class of operator is H^\omega=\Delta+\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d}\omega_n P_n on the Hilbert space \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d), where \Delta is discrete laplacian, P_n are projection onto \ell^2(\{x\in\mathbb{Z}^d:n_il_i<x_i\leq (n_i+1)l_i\}) for some l_1,\cdots,l_d\in\mathbb{N} and \{\omega_n\}_n are i.i.d real bounded random variables following absolutely continuous distribution. We prove that the multiplicity of singular spectrum is bounded above by 2^d-d independent of \{l_i\}_{i=1}^d. When l_i+1\not\in 2\mathbb{N}\cup3\mathbb{N} for all i and gcd(l_i+1,l_j+1)=1 for i\neq j, we also prove that the singular spectrum is simple.
