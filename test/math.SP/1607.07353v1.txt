We study the persistence of localization for a strongly disordered tight-binding Anderson model on the lattice \mathbb{Z}^d, periodically driven on each site. Under two different sets of conditions, we show that Anderson localization survives if the driving frequency is higher than some threshold value that we determine. We discuss the implication of our results for recent development in condensed matter physics, we compare them with the predictions issuing from adiabatic theory, and we comment on the connexion with Mott's law, derived within the linear response formalism.
