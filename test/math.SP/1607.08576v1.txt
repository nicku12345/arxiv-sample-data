In this paper we obtain upper quantum dynamical bounds as a corollary of positive Lyapunov exponent for Schr\"odinger operators H_{f,\theta} u(n)=u(n+1)+u(n-1)+ \phi(f^n\theta)u(n), where \phi : \mathcal{M}\to {\Bbb R} is a piecewise H\"older function on a compact Riemannian manifold \mathcal{M}, and f:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M} is a uniquely ergodic volume preserving map with zero topological entropy. As corollaries we obtain localization-type statements for shifts and skew-shifts on higher dimensional tori with arithmetic conditions on the parameters. These are the first localization-type results with precise arithmetic conditions for multi-frequency quasiperiodic and skew-shift potentials.
