We establish a topological criterion for connection between reducibility to constant rotations and dual localization, for the general family of analytic quasiperiodic Jacobi operators. As a corollary, we obtain the sharp arithmetic phase transition for the extended Harper's model in the positive Lyapunov exponent region.
