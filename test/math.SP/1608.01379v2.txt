We prove dynamical and spectral localization at all energies for the discrete generalized Anderson model via the Kunz-Souillard approach to localization. This is an extension of the original Kunz-Souillard approach to localization for Schr\"odinger operators, to the case where a single random variable determines the potential on a block of an arbitrary, but fixed, size \alpha. For this model, we also give a description of the almost sure spectrum as a set and prove uniform positivity of the Lyapunov exponents. In fact, regarding positivity of the Lyapunov exponents, we prove a stronger statement where we also allow finitely supported distributions. We also show that for any size \alpha {\it generalized Anderson model}, there exists some finitely supported distribution \nu for which the Lyapunov exponent will vanish for at least one energy. Moreover, restricting to the special case \alpha=1, we describe a pleasant consequence of this modified technique to the original Kunz-Souillard approach to localization. In particular, we demonstrate that actually the single operator T_1 is a strict contraction in L^2(\mathbb{R}), whereas before it was only shown that the second iterate of T_1 is a strict contraction.
