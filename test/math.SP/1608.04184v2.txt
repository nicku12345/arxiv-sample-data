Let H_0 = -\Delta + V_0(x) be a Schroedinger operator on L_2(\mathbb{R}^\nu), \nu=1,2, or 3, where V_0(x) is a bounded measurable real-valued function on \mathbb{R}^\nu. Let V be an operator of multiplication by a bounded integrable real-valued function V(x) and put H_r = H_0+rV for real r. We show that the associated spectral shift function (SSF) \xi admits a natural decomposition into the sum of absolutely continuous \xi^{(a)} and singular \xi^{(s)} SSFs. This is a special case of an analogous result for resolvent comparable pairs of self-adjoint operators, which generalises the known case of a trace class perturbation while also simplifying its proof. We present two proofs -- one short and one long -- which we consider to have value of their own. The long proof along the way reframes some classical results from the perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators, including the existence and completeness of the wave operators and the Birman-Krein formula relating the scattering matrix and the SSF. The two proofs demonstrate the equality of the singular SSF with two a priori different but intrinsically integer-valued functions: the total resonance index and the singular \mu-invariant.
