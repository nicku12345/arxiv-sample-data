We consider a Laplace eigenfunction \varphi_\lambda on a smooth closed Riemannian manifold, that is, satisfying -\Delta \varphi_\lambda = \lambda \varphi_\lambda. We introduce several observations about the geometry of its vanishing (nodal) set and corresponding nodal domains.   First, we give asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the volume of a tubular neighbourhood around the nodal set of \varphi_\lambda. This extends previous work of Jakobson and Mangoubi in case  (M, g)  is real-analytic. A significant ingredient in our discussion are some recent techniques due to Logunov (cf. \cite{L1}).   Second, we exhibit some remarks related to the asymptotic geometry of nodal domains. In particular, we observe an analogue of a result of Cheng in higher dimensions regarding the interior opening angle of a nodal domain at a singular point. Further, for nodal domains \Omega_\lambda on which \varphi_\lambda satisfies exponentially small L^\infty bounds, we give some quantitative estimates for radii of inscribed balls.
