We prove an inequality with applications to solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. There is a universal constant c>0, such that if \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2 is simply connected, u:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} vanishes on the boundary \partial \Omega, and |u| assumes a maximum in x_0 \in \Omega, then  \inf_{y \in \partial \Omega}{ \| x_0 - y\|} \geq c \left\| \frac{\Delta u}{u} \right\|^{-1/2}_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}. It was conjectured by P\'olya \& Szeg\H{o} (and proven, independently, by Makai and Hayman) that a membrane vibrating at frequency \lambda contains a disk of size \sim \lambda^{-1/2}. Our inequality implies a refined result: the point on the membrane that achieves the maximal amplitude is at distance \sim \lambda^{-1/2} from the boundary. We also give an extension to higher dimensions (generalizing results of Lieb and Georgiev \& Mukherjee): if u solves -\Delta u = Vu on \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n with Dirichlet boundary conditions, then the ball B with radius \sim \|V\|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}^{-1/2} centered at the point in which |u| assumes a maximum is almost fully contained in \Omega in the sense that |B \cap \Omega| \geq 0.99 |B|.
