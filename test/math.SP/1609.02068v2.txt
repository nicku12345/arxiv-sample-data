We consider functions of Wiener--Hopf type operators on the Hilbert space L^2(\mathbb R^d). It has been known for a long time that the quasi-classical asymptotics for traces of resulting operators strongly depend on the smoothness of the symbol: for smooth symbols the expansion is power-like, whereas discontinuous symbols (e.g. indicator functions) produce an extra logarithmic factor. We investigate the transition regime by studying symbols depending on an extra parameter T\ge 0 in such a way that the symbol tends to a discontinuous one as T\to 0. The main result is two-parameter asymptotics (in the quasi-classical parameter and in T), describing a transition from the smooth case to the discontinuous one. The obtained asymptotic formulas are used to analyse the low-temperature scaling limit of the spatially bipartite entanglement entropy of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions.
