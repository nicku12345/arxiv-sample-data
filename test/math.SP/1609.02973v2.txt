We consider a one-frequency, quasi-periodic, block Jacobi operator, whose blocks are generic matrix-valued analytic functions. We establish Anderson localization for this type of operator under the assumption that the coupling constant is large enough but independent of the frequency. This generalizes a result of J. Bourgain and S. Jitomirskaya on localization for band lattice, quasi-periodic Schroedinger operators.
