We analyze spectral properties of the operator H=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} +\omega^2y^2-\lambda y^2V(x y) in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2), where \omega\ne 0 and V\ge 0 is a compactly supported and sufficiently regular potential. It is known that the spectrum of H depends on the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator L=-\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+\omega^2-\lambda V(x) and it changes substantially as \inf\sigma(L) switches sign. We prove that in the critical case, \inf\sigma(L)=0, the spectrum of H is purely essential and covers the interval [0,\infty). In the subcritical case, \inf\sigma(L)>0, the essential spectrum starts from \omega and there is a non-void discrete spectrum in the interval [0,\omega). We also derive a bound on the corresponding eigenvalue moments.
