In the 1980s, Helffer and Sj\"ostrand examined in a series of articles the concentration of the ground state of a Schr\"odinger operator in the semiclassical limit. In a similar spirit, and using the asymptotics for the Szeg\"o kernel, we show a theorem about the localization properties of the ground state of a Toeplitz operator, when the minimal set of the symbol is a finite set of non-degenerate critical points. Under the same condition on the symbol, for any integer K we describe the first K eigenvalues of the operator.
