We consider harmonic Toeplitz operators T_V = PV:{\mathcal H}(\Omega) \to {\mathcal H}(\Omega) where P: L^2(\Omega) \to {\mathcal H}(\Omega) is the orthogonal projection onto {\mathcal H}(\Omega) = \left\{u \in L^2(\Omega)\,|\,\Delta u = 0 \; \mbox{in}\;\Omega\right\}, \Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^d, d \geq 2, is a bounded domain with \partial \Omega \in C^\infty, and V: \Omega \to {\mathbb C} is a suitable multiplier. First, we complement the known criteria which guarantee that T_V is in the pth Schatten-von Neumann class S_p, by sufficient conditions which imply T_V \in S_{p, {\rm w}}, the weak counterpart of S_p. Next, we assume that \Omega is the unit ball in {\mathbb R}^d, and V = \overline{V} is radially symmetric, and investigate the eigenvalue asymptotics of T_V if V has a power-like decay at \partial \Omega or V is compactly supported in \Omega. Further, we consider general \Omega and V \geq 0 which is regular in \Omega, and admits a power-like decay of rate \gamma > 0 at \partial \Omega, and we show that in this case T_V is unitarily equivalent to a pseudo-differential operator of order -\gamma, self-adjoint in L^2(\partial \Omega). Using this unitary equivalence, we obtain the main asymptotic term of the eigenvalue counting function for the operator T_V. Finally, we introduce the Krein Laplacian K \geq 0, self-adjoint in L^2(\Omega); it is known that {\rm Ker}\,K = {\mathcal H}(\Omega), and the zero eigenvalue of K is isolated. We perturb K by V \in C(\overline{\Omega};{\mathbb R}), and show that \sigma_{\rm ess}(K+V) = V(\partial \Omega). Assuming that V \geq 0 and V{|\partial \Omega} = 0, we study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of K \pm V near the origin, and find that the effective Hamiltonian which governs this distribution is the Toeplitz operator T_V.
