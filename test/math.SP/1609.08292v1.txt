The spectral shift function of a pair of self-adjoint operators is expressed via an abstract operator valued Titchmarsh--Weyl m-function. This general result is applied to different self-adjoint realizations of second-order elliptic partial differential operators on smooth domains with compact boundaries, Schr\"{o}dinger operators with compactly supported potentials, and finally, Schr\"{o}dinger operators with singular potentials supported on hypersurfaces. In these applications the spectral shift function is determined in an explicit form with the help of (energy parameter dependent) Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps.
