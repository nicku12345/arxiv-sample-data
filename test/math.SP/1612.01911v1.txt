In this paper, we will consider generalised eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on some surfaces of infinite area. We will be interested in lower bounds on the number of nodal domains of such eigenfunctions which are included in a given bounded set.   We will first of all consider finite sums of plane waves, and give a criterion on the amplitudes and directions of propagation of these plane waves which guarantees an optimal lower bound, of the same order as Courant's upper bound.   As an application, we will obtain optimal lower bounds for the number of nodal domains of distorted plane waves on some families of surfaces of non-positive curvature.
