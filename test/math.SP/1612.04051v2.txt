For a given subcritical discrete Schr\"odinger operator H on a weighted infinite graph X, we construct a Hardy-weight w which is optimal in the following sense. The operator H - \lambda w is subcritical in X for all \lambda < 1, null-critical in X for \lambda = 1, and supercritical near any neighborhood of infinity in X for any \lambda > 1. Our results rely on a criticality theory for Schr\"odinger operators on general weighted graphs.
