We study direct and inverse scattering problem for systems of interacting particles, having web-like structure. Such systems consist of a finite number of semi-infinite chains attached to the central part formed by a finite number of particles. We assume that the semi-infinite channels are homogeneous at infinity, but the limit values of the coefficients may vary from one chain to another.
