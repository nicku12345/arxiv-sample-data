In this note, we will consider semiclassical scattering for compactly supported non-trapping perturbations of the Laplacian on \mathbb{R}^d. We will define a family of Gaussian states on \mathbb{S}^{d-1}, parametrized by points in T^*\mathbb{S}^{d-1}, and show that the action of the scattering matrix on a Gaussian state of parameter \rho\in T^*\mathbb{S}^{d-1} is still a Gaussian state, with parameter \kappa(\rho), where \kappa is the (classical) scattering map. This is one way of saying that \emph{the scattering matrix quantizes the scattering map}, complementary to a previous result of Alexandrova in terms of Fourier Integral Operators.
