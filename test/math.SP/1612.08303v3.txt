Under the weak interaction regime, we prove the one and the two volumes Wegner type bounds for one dimensional multi-particle models on the lattice and for very singular probability distribution functions such as the Bernoulli measures. The results imply the Anderson loclalization in both the spectral exponential and the strong dynamical localization for the one dimensional multi-particle Bernoulli-Anderson model with weak interaction.
