Let f: X\to {\Bbb C}P^1 be a meromorphic function of degree N with simple poles and simple critical points on a compact Riemann surface X of genus g and let \mathsf m be the standard round metric of curvature 1 on the Riemann sphere {\Bbb C}P^1. Then the pullback f^*\mathsf m of \mathsf m under f is a metric of curvature 1 with conical singularities of conical angles 4\pi at the critical points of f. We study the \zeta-regularized determinant of the Laplace operator on X corresponding to the metric f^*\mathsf m as a functional on the moduli space of the pairs (X, f) (i.e. on the Hurwitz space H_{g, N}(1, \dots, 1)) and derive an explicit formula for the functional.
