We consider scattering by star-shaped obstacles in hyperbolic space and show that resonances satisfy a universal bound \mathrm{Im}\,\lambda \leq -\frac{1}{2} which is optimal in dimension 2. In odd dimensions we also show that \mathrm{Im}\,\lambda \leq -\frac{\mu}{\rho} for a universal constant \mu, where \rho is the radius of a ball containing the obstacle; this gives an improvement for small obstacles. In dimensions 3 and higher the proofs follow the classical vector field approach of Morawetz, while in dimension 2 we obtain our bound by working with spaces coming from general relativity. We also show that in odd dimensions resonances of small obstacles are close, in a suitable sense, to Euclidean resonances.
