We prove that finite perimeter subsets of \mathbb{R}^{n+1} with small isoperimetric deficit have boundary Hausdorff-close to a sphere up to a subset of small measure. We also refine this closeness under some additional a priori integral curvature bounds. As an application, we answer a question raised by B. Colbois concerning the almost extremal hypersurfaces for Chavel's inequality.
