Motivated by applications for non-perturbative topological strings in toric Calabi--Yau manifolds, we discuss the spectral problem for a pair of commuting modular conjugate (in the sense of Faddeev) Harper type operators, corresponding to a special case of the quantized mirror curve of local \mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1 and complex values of Planck's constant. We illustrate our analytical results by numerical calculations.
