For the multi-particle Anderson model with correlated random potential in the continuum, we show under fairly general assumptions on the inter-particle interaction and the random external potential, the Anderson localization which consists of both the spectral, exponential localization and the strong dynamical localization. The localization results are proven near the lower spectral edge of the almost sure spectrum and the proofs require the uniform log-H\"older continuity assumption of the probability distribution functions of the random field in addition of the Rosenblatt's strongly mixing condition.
