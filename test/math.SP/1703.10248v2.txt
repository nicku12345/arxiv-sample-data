We study the relationship between L^\infty growth of eigenfunctions and their L^2 concentration as measured by defect measures. In particular, we show that scarring in the sense of concentration of defect measure on certain submanifolds is incompatible with maximal L^\infty growth. In addition, we show that a defect measure which is too diffuse, such as the Liouville measure, is also incompatible with maximal eigenfunction growth.
