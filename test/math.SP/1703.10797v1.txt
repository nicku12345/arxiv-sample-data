This article is concerned with quantitative unique continuation estimates for equations involving a "sum of squares" operator \mathcal{L} on a compact manifold \mathcal{M} assuming: (i) the Chow-Rashevski-H\"ormander condition ensuring the hypoellipticity of \mathcal{L}, and (ii) the analyticity of \mathcal{M} and the coefficients of \mathcal{L}.   The first result is the tunneling estimate \|\varphi\|_{L^2(\omega)} \geq Ce^{- \lambda^{\frac{k}{2}}} for normalized eigenfunctions \varphi of \mathcal{L} from a nonempty open set \omega\subset \mathcal{M}, where k is the hypoellipticity index of \mathcal{L} and \lambda the eigenvalue.   The main result is a stability estimate for solutions to the hypoelliptic wave equation (\partial_t^2+\mathcal{L})u=0: for T>2 \sup_{x \in \mathcal{M}}(dist(x,\omega)) (here, dist is the sub-Riemannian distance), the observation of the solution on (0,T)\times \omega determines the data. The constant involved in the estimate is Ce^{c\Lambda^k} where \Lambda is the typical frequency of the data.   We then prove the approximate controllability of the hypoelliptic heat equation (\partial_t+\mathcal{L})v=1_\omega f in any time, with appropriate (exponential) cost, depending on k. In case k=2 (Grushin, Heisenberg...), we further show approximate controllability to trajectories with polynomial cost in large time.   We also explain how the analyticity assumption can be relaxed, and a boundary \partial \mathcal{M} can be added in some situations.   Most results turn out to be optimal on a family of Grushin-type operators.   The main proof relies on the general strategy developed by the authors in arxiv:1506.04254.
