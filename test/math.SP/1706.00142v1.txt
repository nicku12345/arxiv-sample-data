We consider the sloshing problem for an incompressible, inviscid, irrotational fluid in an open container, including effects due to surface tension on the free surface. We restrict ourselves to a constant contact angle and seek time-harmonic solutions of the linearized problem, which describes the time-evolution of the fluid due to a small initial disturbance of the surface at rest. As opposed to the zero surface tension case, where the problem reduces to a partial differential equation for the velocity potential, we obtain a coupled system for the velocity potential and the free surface displacement. We derive a new variational formulation of the coupled problem and establish the existence of solutions using the direct method from the calculus of variations. We prove a domain monotonicity result for the fundamental sloshing eigenvalue. In the limit of zero surface tension, we recover the variational formulation of the mixed Steklov-Neumann eigenvalue problem and give the first-order perturbation formula for a simple eigenvalue.
