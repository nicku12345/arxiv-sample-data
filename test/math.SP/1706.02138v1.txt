Let \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n be a bounded domain satisfying a Hayman-type asymmetry condition, and let  D  be an arbitrary bounded domain referred to as "obstacle". We are interested in the behaviour of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue  \lambda_1(\Omega \setminus (x+D)) . First, we prove an upper bound on  \lambda_1(\Omega \setminus (x+D))  in terms of the distance of the set  x+D  to the set of maximum points  x_0  of the first Dirichlet ground state  \phi_{\lambda_1} > 0  of  \Omega . In short, a direct corollary is that if \begin{equation} \mu_\Omega := \max_{x}\lambda_1(\Omega \setminus (x+D)) \end{equation} is large enough in terms of  \lambda_1(\Omega) , then all maximizer sets  x+D  of  \mu_\Omega  are close to each maximum point  x_0  of  \phi_{\lambda_1} .   Second, we discuss the distribution of  \phi_{\lambda_1(\Omega)}  and the possibility to inscribe wavelength balls at a given point in  \Omega .   Finally, we specify our observations to convex obstacles  D  and show that if  \mu_\Omega  is sufficiently large with respect to  \lambda_1(\Omega) , then all maximizers  x+D  of  \mu_\Omega  contain all maximum points  x_0  of  \phi_{\lambda_1(\Omega)} .
