Let \phi be a spherical Hecke-Maass cusp form on the non-compact space \mathrm{PGL}_3(\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathrm{PGL}_3(\mathbb{R}). We establish various pointwise upper bounds for \phi in terms of its Laplace eigenvalue \lambda_\phi. These imply, for \phi arithmetically normalized and tempered at the archimedean place, the bound \|\phi\|_\infty\ll_\epsilon \lambda_{\phi}^{39/40+\epsilon} for the global sup-norm (without restriction to a compact subset). On the way, we derive a new uniform upper bound for the \mathrm{GL}_3 Jacquet-Whittaker function.
