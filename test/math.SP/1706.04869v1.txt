Let H be a Schr\"odinger operator defined on a noncompact Riemannian manifold \Omega, and let W\in L^\infty(\Omega;\mathbb{R}). Suppose that the operator H+W is critical in \Omega, and let \varphi be the corresponding Agmon ground state. We prove that if u is a generalized eigenfunction of H satisfying |u|\leq \varphi in \Omega, then the corresponding eigenvalue is in the spectrum of H. The conclusion also holds true if for some K\Subset \Omega the operator H admits a positive solution in \tilde{\Omega}=\Omega\setminus K, and |u|\leq \psi in \tilde{\Omega}, where \psi is a positive solution of minimal growth in a neighborhood of infinity in \Omega.   Under natural assumptions, this result holds true also in the context of infinite graphs, and Dirichlet forms.
