For a general class of difference operators H_\varepsilon = T_\varepsilon + V_\varepsilon on \ell^2(\varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d), where V_\varepsilon is a multi-well potential and \varepsilon is a small parameter, we analyze the asymptotic behavior as \varepsilon\to 0 of the (low-lying) eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We show that the first n eigenvalues of H_\varepsilon converge to the first n eigenvalues of the direct sum of harmonic oscillators on \mathbb{R}^d located at the several wells. Our proof is microlocal.
