We study Leinster's notion of magnitude for a compact metric space. For a smooth, compact domain X\subset \mathbb{R}^{2m-1}, we find geometric significance in the function \mathcal{M}_X(R) = \mathrm{mag}(R\cdot X). The function \mathcal{M}_X extends from the positive half-line to a meromorphic function in the complex plane. Its poles are generalized scattering resonances. In the semiclassical limit R \to \infty, \mathcal{M}_X admits an asymptotic expansion. The three leading terms of \mathcal{M}_X at R=+\infty are proportional to the volume, surface area and integral of the mean curvature. In particular, for convex X the leading terms are proportional to the intrinsic volumes, and we obtain an asymptotic variant of the convex magnitude conjecture by Leinster and Willerton, with corrected coefficients.
