For a semi-finite von Neumann algebra \mathcal A, we study the case of equality in Young's inequality of s-numbers for a pair of \tau-measurable operators a,b, and we prove that equality is only possible if |a|^p=|b|^q. We also extend the result to unbounded operators affiliated with \mathcal A, and relate this problem with other symmetric norm Young inequalities.
