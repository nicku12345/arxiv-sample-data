In this paper, we study the semi-classical behavior of distorted plane waves, on manifolds that are Euclidean near infinity or hyperbolic near infinity, and of non-positive curvature. Assuming that there is a strip without resonances below the real axis, we show that distorted plane waves are bounded in L^2_{loc} independently of h, that they admit a unique semiclassical measure, and we prove bounds on their L^p_{loc} norms.
