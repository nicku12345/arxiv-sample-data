We describe the resonances closest to the real axis generated by diffraction of waves among cone points on a manifold with Euclidean ends. These resonances lie asymptotically evenly spaced along a curve of the form \frac{\Im \lambda}{\log \left |\Re   \lambda\right |}= -\nu; here \nu=(n-1)/2 L_0 where n is the dimension and L_0 is the length of the longest geodesic connecting two cone points. Moreover there are asymptotically no resonances below this curve and above the curve  \frac{\Im \lambda}{\log \left |\Re   \lambda\right |}= -\Lambda  for a fixed \Lambda>\nu.
