In this note we prove in the nonlinear setting of CD(K,\infty) spaces the stability of the Krasnoselskii spectrum of the Laplace operator -\Delta under measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, under an additional compactness assumption satisfied, for instance, by sequences of CD^*(K,N) metric measure spaces with uniformly bounded diameter. Additionally, we show that every element \lambda in the Krasnoselskii spectrum is indeed an eigenvalue, namely there exists a nontrivial u satisfying the eigenvalue equation - \Delta u = \lambda u.
