In this paper, we investigate the performance analysis and synthesis of distributed system throttlers (DST). A throttler is a mechanism that limits the flow rate of incoming metrics, e.g., byte per second, network bandwidth usage, capacity, traffic, etc. This can be used to protect a service's backend/clients from getting overloaded, or to reduce the effects of uncertainties in demand for shared services. We study performance deterioration of DSTs subject to demand uncertainty. We then consider network synthesis problems that aim to improve the performance of noisy DSTs via communication link modifications as well as server update cycle modifications.
