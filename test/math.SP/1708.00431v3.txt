This work is a galoisian study of the spectral problem L\Psi=\lambda\Psi, for algebro-geometric second order differential operators L, with coefficients in a differential field, whose field of constants C is algebraically closed and of characteristic zero. Our approach regards the spectral parameter \lambda an algebraic variable over C, forcing the consideration of a new field of coefficients for L-\lambda, whose field of constants is the field C(\Gamma) of the spectral curve \Gamma. Since C(\Gamma) is no longer algebraically closed, the need arises of a new algebraic structure, generated by the solutions of the spectral problem over \Gamma, called "Spectral Picard-Vessiot field" of L-\lambda. An existence theorem is proved using differential algebra, allowing to recover classical Picard-Vessiot theory for each  \lambda = \lambda_0 . For rational spectral curves, the appropriate algebraic setting is established to solve L\Psi=\lambda\Psi analitically and to use symbolic integration. We illustrate our results for Rosen-Morse solitons.
