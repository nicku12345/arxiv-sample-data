Let H denote the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian on \mathbb{R}^d, perturbed by an isotropic pseudodifferential operator of order 1. We consider the Schr\"odinger propagator U(t)=e^{-itH}, and find that while \operatorname{singsupp} \operatorname{Tr} U(t) \subset 2 \pi \mathbb{Z} as in the unperturbed case, there exists a large class of perturbations in dimension d \geq 2 for which the singularities of \operatorname{Tr} U(t) at nonzero multiples of 2 \pi are weaker than the singularity at t=0. The remainder term in the Weyl law is of order o(\lambda^{d-1}), improving in these cases the O(\lambda^{d-1}) remainder previously established by Helffer--Robert.
