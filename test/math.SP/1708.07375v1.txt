We analyze spectral properties of two mutually related families of magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operators, H_{\mathrm{Sm}}(A)=(i \nabla +A)^2+\omega^2 y^2+\lambda y \delta(x) and H(A)=(i \nabla +A)^2+\omega^2 y^2+ \lambda y^2 V(x y) in L^2(R^2), with the parameters \omega>0 and \lambda<0, where A is a vector potential corresponding to a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and V is a regular nonnegative and compactly supported potential. We show that the spectral properties of the operators depend crucially on the one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger operators L= -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2} +\omega^2 +\lambda \delta (x) and L (V)= - \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2} +\omega^2 +\lambda V(x), respectively. Depending on whether the operators L and L(V) are positive or not, the spectrum of H_{\mathrm{Sm}}(A) and H(V) exhibits a sharp transition.
