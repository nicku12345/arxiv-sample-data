We investigate the distribution of the resonances near spectral thresholds of Laplace operators on regular tree graphs with k-fold branching, k \geq 1, perturbed by nonself-adjoint exponentially decaying potentials. We establish results on the absence of resonances which in particular involve absence of discrete spectrum near some sectors of the essential spectrum of the operators.
