We study multi-frequency quasiperiodic Schr\"{o}dinger operators on \mathbb{Z} . We prove that for a large real analytic potential satisfying certain restrictions the spectrum consists of a single interval. The result is a consequence of a criterion for the spectrum to contain an interval at a given location that we establish non-perturbatively in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponent.
