We use the \emph{unit-graphs} and the \emph{special unit-digraphs} on matrix rings to show that every n \times n nonzero matrix over \Bbb F_q can be written as a sum of two \operatorname{SL}_n-matrices when n>1. We compute the eigenvalues of these graphs in terms of Kloosterman sums and study their spectral properties; and prove that if X is a subset of \operatorname{Mat}_2 (\Bbb F_q) with size |X| > \frac{2 q^3 \sqrt{q}}{q - 1}, then X contains at least two distinct matrices whose difference has determinant \alpha for any \alpha \in \Bbb F_q^{\ast}. Using this result we also prove a sum-product type result: if A,B,C,D \subseteq \Bbb F_q satisfy \sqrt[4]{|A||B||C||D|}= \Omega (q^{0.75}) as q \rightarrow \infty, then (A - B)(C - D) equals all of \Bbb F_q. In particular, if A is a subset of \Bbb F_q with cardinality |A| > \frac{3} {2} q^{\frac{3}{4}}, then the subset (A - A) (A - A) equals all of \Bbb F_q. We also recover a classical result: every element in any finite ring of odd order can be written as the sum of two units.
