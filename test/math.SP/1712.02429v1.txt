Motivated by the intriguing behavior displayed in a dynamic network that models a population of extreme introverts and extroverts (XIE), we consider the spectral properties of ensembles of random split graph adjacency matrices. We discover that, in general, a gap emerges in the bulk spectrum between -1 and 0 that contains a single eigenvalue. An analytic expression for the bulk distribution is derived and verified with numerical analysis. We also examine their relation to chiral ensembles, which are associated with bipartite graphs.
