Let \phi be an L^2-normalized spherical vector in an everywhere unramified cuspidal automorphic representation of \mathrm{PGL}_n over \mathbb{Q} with Laplace eigenvalue \lambda_{\phi}. We establish explicit estimates for various quantities related to \phi that are uniform in \lambda_{\phi}. This includes uniforms bounds for spherical Whittaker functions on \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}), uniform bounds for the global sup-norm of \phi, and uniform bounds for the "essential support" of \phi, i.e. the region outside which it decays exponentially. The proofs combine analytic and arithmetic tools.
