Let \mathsf m be any conical (or smooth) metric of finite volume on the Riemann sphere \Bbb CP^1. On a compact Riemann surface X of genus g consider a meromorphic funciton f: X\to {\Bbb C}P^1 such that all poles and critical points of f are simple and no critical value of f coincides with a conical singularity of \mathsf m or \{\infty\}. The pullback f^*\mathsf m of \mathsf m under f has conical singularities of angles 4\pi at the critical points of f and other conical singularities that are the preimages of those of \mathsf m. We study the \zeta-regularized determinant \operatorname{Det}' \Delta_F of the (Friedrichs extension of) Laplace-Beltrami operator on (X,f^*\mathsf m) as a functional on the moduli space of pairs (X, f) and obtain an explicit formula for \operatorname{Det}' \Delta_F.
