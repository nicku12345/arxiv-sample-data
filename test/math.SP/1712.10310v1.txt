We show that, in round spheres of dimension n\geq3, for any given collection of codimension 2 smooth submanifolds \mathfrak{S}:=\{\Sigma_1,...,\Sigma_N\} of arbitrarily complicated topology (N being the complex dimension of the spinor bundle), there is always an eigenfunction \psi=(\psi_1,...,\psi_N) of the Dirac operator such that each submanifold \Sigma_a, modulo ambient diffeomorphism, is a structurally stable nodal set of the spinor component \psi_a. The result holds for any choice of trivialization of the spinor bundle. The emergence of these structures takes place at small scales and sufficiently high energies.
