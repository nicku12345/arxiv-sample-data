The purpose of the paper is to obtain estimates for differences of functions of two pairs of commuting contractions on Hilbert space. In particular, Lipschitz type estimates, H\"older type estimates, Schatten--von Neumann estimates are obtained. The results generalize earlier known results for functions of self-adjoint operators, normal operators, contractions and dissipative operators.
