Consider the metric cone X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)_r\times Y with the metric g=\mathrm{d}r^2+r^2h where the cross section Y is a compact (n-1)-dimensional Riemannian manifold (Y,h). Let \Delta_g be the Friedrich extension positive Laplacian on X and let \Delta_h be the positive Laplacian on Y, and consider the operator \LL_V=\Delta_g+V_0 r^{-2} where V_0\in\CC^\infty(Y) such that \Delta_h+V_0+(n-2)^2/4 is a strictly positive operator on L^2(Y). In this paper, we prove the global-in-time Strichartz estimates without loss for the wave equation associated with the operator \LL_V which verifies\cite[Remark 2.4]{wang} Wang's conjecture for wave equation. The range of the admissible pair is sharp and is influenced by the smallest eigenvalue of \Delta_h+V_0+(n-2)^2/4. To prove the result, we show a Sobolev inequality and a boundedness of a generalized Riesz transform in this setting. In addition, as an application, we study the well-posed theory and scattering theory for energy-critical wave equation with small data on this setting of dimension n\geq3.
