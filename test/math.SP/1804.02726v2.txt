In this paper, we establish a kind of splitting theorem for the eigenvalues of a specific family of operators on the base of a warped product. As a consequence, we prove a density theorem for a set of warping functions that makes the spectrum of the Laplacian a warped-simple spectrum. This is then used to study the generic situation of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a class of compact G-manifolds. In particular, we give a partial answer to a question posed in 1990 by Steven Zelditch about the generic situation of multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on principal bundles.
