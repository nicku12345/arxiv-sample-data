We prove an analogue of Alon's spectral gap conjecture for random bipartite, biregular graphs. We use the Ihara-Bass formula to connect the non-backtracking spectrum to that of the adjacency matrix, employing the moment method to show there exists a spectral gap for the non-backtracking matrix. Finally, we give some applications in machine learning and coding theory.
