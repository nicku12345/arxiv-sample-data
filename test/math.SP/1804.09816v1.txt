We discuss the geometry of Laplacian eigenfunctions -\Delta \phi = \lambda \phi on compact manifolds (M,g) and combinatorial graphs G=(V,E). The 'dual' geometry of Laplacian eigenfunctions is well understood on \mathbb{T}^d (identified with \mathbb{Z}^d) and \mathbb{R}^n (which is self-dual). The dual geometry is of tremendous role in various fields of pure and applied mathematics. The purpose of our paper is to point out a notion of similarity between eigenfunctions that allows to reconstruct that geometry. Our measure of 'similarity'  \alpha(\phi_{\lambda}, \phi_{\mu}) between eigenfunctions \phi_{\lambda} and \phi_{\mu} is given by a global average of local correlations  \alpha(\phi_{\lambda}, \phi_{\mu})^2 = \| \phi_{\lambda} \phi_{\mu} \|_{L^2}^{-2}\int_{M}{ \left( \int_{M}{ p(t,x,y)( \phi_{\lambda}(y) - \phi_{\lambda}(x))( \phi_{\mu}(y) - \phi_{\mu}(x)) dy} \right)^2 dx}, where p(t,x,y) is the classical heat kernel and e^{-t \lambda} + e^{-t \mu} = 1. This notion recovers all classical notions of duality but is equally applicable to other (rough) geometries and graphs; many numerical examples in different continuous and discrete settings illustrate the result.
