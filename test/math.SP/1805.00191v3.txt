We consider a 3D quantum system of N identical bosons in a trapping potential |x|^p, with p\geq0, interacting via a Newton potential with an attractive interaction strength a_{N}. For a fixed large N and the coupling constant a_{N} smaller than a critical value a_{*} (Chandrasekhar limit mass), in an appropriate sense, the many-body system admits a ground state. We investigate the blow-up behavior of the ground state energy as well as the ground states when a_{N} approaches a_{*} sufficiently slowly in the limit N\to\infty. The blow-up profile is given by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg solutions.
