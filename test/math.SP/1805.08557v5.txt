For generators of Markov semigroups which lack a spectral gap, it is shown how bounds on the density of states near zero lead to a so-called "weak Poincar\'e inequality" (WPI), originally introduced by Liggett [Ann. Probab., 1991]. Applications to general classes of constant coefficient pseudodifferential operators are studied. Particular examples are the heat semigroup and the semigroup generated by the fractional Laplacian in the whole space, where the optimal decay rates are recovered. Moreover, the classical Nash inequality appears as a special case of the WPI for the heat semigroup.
