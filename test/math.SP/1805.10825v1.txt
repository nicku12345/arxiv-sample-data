A partial matrix over a field \mathbb{F} is a matrix whose entries are either an element of \mathbb{F} or an indeterminate and with each indeterminate only appearing once. A completion is an assignment of values in \mathbb{F} to all indeterminates. Given a partial matrix, through elementary row operations and column permutation it can be decomposed into a block matrix of the form \left[\begin{smallmatrix}{\bf W} & * & * \\ 0 & {\bf S} & * \\ 0 & 0 & {\bf T} \end{smallmatrix}\right] where {\bf W} is wide (has more columns than rows), {\bf S} is square, {\bf T} is tall (has more rows than columns), and these three blocks have at least one completion with full rank. And importantly, each one of the blocks {\bf W}, {\bf S} and {\bf T} is unique up to elementary row operations and column permutation whenever {\bf S} is required to be as large as possible. When this is the case \left[\begin{smallmatrix}{\bf W} & * & * \\ 0 & {\bf S} & * \\ 0 & 0 & {\bf T} \end{smallmatrix}\right] will be called a WST-decomposition. With this decomposition it is trivial to compute maximum rank of a completion of the original partial matrix: \#\mbox{rows}({\bf W})+\#\mbox{rows}({\bf S})+\#\mbox{cols}({\bf T}). In fact we introduce the WST-decomposition for a broader class of matrices: the ACI-matrices.
