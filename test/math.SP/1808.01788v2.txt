The geometric descriptions of the (essential) spectra of Toeplitz operators with piecewise continuous symbols are among the most beautiful results about Toeplitz operators on Hardy spaces H^p with 1<p<\infty. In the Hardy space H^1, the essential spectra of Toeplitz operators are known for continuous symbols and symbols in the Douglas algebra C+H^\infty. It is natural to ask whether the theory for piecewise continuous symbols can also be extended to H^1. We answer this question in negative and show in particular that the Toeplitz operator is never bounded on H^1 if its symbol has a jump discontinuity.
