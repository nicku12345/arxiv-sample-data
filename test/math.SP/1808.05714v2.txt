We consider quantum walks with position dependent coin on 1D lattice \mathbb{Z}. The dispersive estimate \|U^tP_c u_0\|_{l^\infty}\lesssim (1+|t|)^{-1/3} \|u_0\|_{l^1} is shown under l^{1,1} perturbation for the generic case and l^{1,2} perturbation for the exceptional case, where U is the evolution operator of a quantum walk and P_c is the projection to the continuous spectrum. This is an analogue result for Schr\"odinger operators and discrete Schr\"odinger operators. The proof is based on the estimate of oscillatory integrals expressed by Jost solutions.
