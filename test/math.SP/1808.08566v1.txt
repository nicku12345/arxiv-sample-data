We consider functions f(T,R) of pairs of noncommuting contractions on Hilbert space and study the problem for which functions f we have Lipschitz type estimates in Schatten--von Neumann norms. We prove that if f belongs to the Besov class (B_{\infty,1}^1)_+({\Bbb D}^2) of analytic functions in the bidisk, then we have a Lipschitz type estimate for functions f(T,R) of pairs of not necessarily commuting contractions (T,R) in the Schatten--von Neumann norms \boldsymbol{S}_p for p\in[1,2]. On the other hand, we show that for functions in the Besov space (B_{\infty,1}^1)_+({\Bbb D}^2), there are no Lipschitz such type estimates for p>2 as well as in the operator norm.
