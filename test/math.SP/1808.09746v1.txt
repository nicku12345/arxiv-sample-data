The Dirac operator, acting in three dimensions, is considered. Assuming that a large mass m>0 lies outside a smooth and bounded open set \Omega\subset\R^3, it is proved that its spectrum is approximated by the one of the Dirac operator on \Omega with the MIT bag boundary condition. The approximation, which is developed up to and error of order o(1/\sqrt m), is carried out by introducing tubular coordinates in a neighborhood of \partial\Omega and analyzing the corresponding one dimensional optimization problems in the normal direction.
