A generalization of the Poisson distribution based on the generalized Mittag-Leffler function E_{\alpha, \beta}(\lambda) is proposed and the raw moments are calculated algebraically in terms of Bell polynomials. It is demonstrated, that the proposed distribution function contains the standard fractional Poisson distribution as a subset. A possible interpretation of the additional parameter \beta is suggested.
