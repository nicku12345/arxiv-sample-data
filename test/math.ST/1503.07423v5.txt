Analyzing point patterns with linear structures has recently been of interest in e.g. neuroscience and geography. To detect anisotropy in such cases, we introduce a functional summary statistic, called the cylindrical K-function, since it is a directional K-function whose structuring element is a cylinder. Further we introduce a class of anisotropic Cox point processes, called Poisson line cluster point processes. The points of such a process are random displacements of Poisson point processes defined on the lines of a Poisson line process. Parameter estimation based on moment methods or Bayesian inference for this model is discussed when the underlying Poisson line process and the cluster memberships are treated as hidden processes. To illustrate the methodologies, we analyze a two and a three-dimensional point pattern data set. The 3D data set is of particular interest as it relates to the minicolumn hypothesis in neuroscience, claiming that pyramidal and other brain cells have a columnar arrangement perpendicular to the pial surface of the brain.
