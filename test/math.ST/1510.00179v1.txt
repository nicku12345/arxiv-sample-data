The possibilities of the use of the coefficient of variation over a high threshold in tail modelling are discussed. The paper also considers multiple threshold tests for a generalized Pareto distribution, together with a threshold selection algorithm. One of the main contributions is to extend the methodology based on moments to all distributions, even without finite moments. These techniques are applied to Danish fire insurance losses.
