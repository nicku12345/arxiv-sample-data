The multivariate errors-in-variables regression model is applicable when both dependent and independent variables in a multivariate regression are subject to measurement errors. In such a scenario it is long established that the traditional least squares approach to estimating the model parameters is biased and inconsistent. The generalized least squares, ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood estimators (under the assumption of Gaussian errors) were derived in the seminal paper of Gleser (1981). However, the ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood estimators for the mean vectors were incorrectly derived. In this short paper we amend this error, presenting the correct estimators of the mean vectors.
