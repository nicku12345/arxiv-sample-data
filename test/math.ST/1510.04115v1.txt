Assume that we observe a stochastic process (X(t))_{t\in[-r,T]}, which satisfies the linear stochastic delay differential equation \[   \mathrm{d} X(t)   = \vartheta \int_{[-r,0]} X(t + u) \, a(\mathrm{d} u) \, \mathrm{d} t + \mathrm{d} W(t) ,   \qquad t \geq 0 , \] where a is a finite signed measure on [-r, 0]. The local asymptotic properties of the likelihood function are studied. Local asymptotic normality is proved in case of v_\vartheta^* < 0, local asymptotic quadraticity is shown if v_\vartheta^* = 0, and, under some additional conditions, local asymptotic mixed normality or periodic local asymptotic mixed normality is valid if v_\vartheta^* > 0, where v_\vartheta^* is an appropriately defined quantity. As an application, the asymptotic behaviour of the maximum likelihood estimator \widehat{\vartheta}_T of \vartheta based on (X(t))_{t\in[-r,T]} can be derived as T \to \infty.
