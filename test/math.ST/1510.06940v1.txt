A mixture density, f_p, is estimable in R^d, \ d \ge 1, but an estimate for the mixing density, p, is usually obtained only when d is unity; h is the mixture's kernel. When f_p's estimate has form f_{\hat p_n} and p is \tilde q-smooth, vanishing outside a compact in R^d, plug-in upper bounds are obtained herein for the L_u-error (and risk)of \hat p_n and its derivatives; d \ge 1, 1 \le u \le \infty. The bounds depend on f_{\hat p_n}'s L_u-error (or risk), h's Fourier transform, \tilde h, and the bandwidth of kernel K used in approximations. The choice of \hat p_n, via f_{\hat p_n}, suggests that \hat p_n's error rate could be only nearly optimal when f_{\hat p_n} is optimal, but competing estimates and their error rates may not be available for d>1. In examples with d unity, the upper bound is optimal when h is super smooth, misses the optimal rate by the factor (\log n)^{\xi}, \ \xi>0, when h is smooth, and is satisfactory when \tilde h has periodic zeros.
