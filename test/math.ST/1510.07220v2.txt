The diverse applications of the Benford law attract investigators working in various fields of physics, biology and sociology. At the same time, the groundings of the Benford law remain obscure. Our paper demonstrates that the Benford law arises from the positional (place-value) notation accepted for representing various sets of data. An alternative to Benford formulae to predict the distribution of digits in statistical data are derived. Application of these formulae to the statistical analysis of infrared spectra of polymers is presented. Violations of the Benford Law are discussed.
