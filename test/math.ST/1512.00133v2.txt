This paper study sparse classification problems. We show that under single-index models, vanilla Lasso could give good estimate of unknown parameters. With this result, we see that even if the model is not linear, and even if the response is not continuous, we could still use vanilla Lasso to train classifiers. Simulations confirm that vanilla Lasso could be used to get a good estimation when data are generated from a logistic regression model.
