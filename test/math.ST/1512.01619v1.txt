We introduce a point process regression model that is applicable to price models and limit order book models. Hawkes type autoregression in the intensity process is generalized to a stochastic regression to covariate processes. We establish the so-called quasi likelihood analysis, which gives a polynomial type large deviation estimate for the statistical random field. We derive large sample properties of the maximum likelihood type estimator and the Bayesian type estimator when the intensity processes become large under a finite time horizon. There appears non-ergodic statistics. A classical approach is also mentioned.
