In this paper, we propose to obtain the skewed version of a unimodal symmetric density using a skewing mechanism that is not based on a cumulative distribution function. Then we disturb the unimodality of the resulting skewed density. In order to introduce skewness we use the general method which transforms any continuous unimodal and symmetric distribution into a skewed one by changing the scale at each side of the mode.
