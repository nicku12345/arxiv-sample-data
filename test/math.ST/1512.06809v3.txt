We study the binary classification problem for Poisson point processes, which are allowed to take values in a general metric space. The problem is tackled in two different ways: estimating nonparametricaly the intensity functions of the processes (and then plugged into a deterministic formula which expresses the regression function in terms of the intensities), and performing the classical k nearest neighbor rule by introducing a suitable distance between patterns of points. In the first approach we prove the consistency of the estimated intensity so that the rule turns out to be also consistent. For the k-NN classifier, we prove that the regression function fulfils the so called "Besicovitch condition", usually required for the consistency of the classical classification rules. The theoretical findings are illustrated on simulated data, where in one case the k-NN rule outperforms the first approach.
