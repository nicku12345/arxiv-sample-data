We consider kernel smoothed Grenander-type estimators for a monotone hazard rate and a monotone density in the presence of randomly right censored data. We show that they converge at rate n^{2/5} and that the limit distribution at a fixed point is Gaussian with explicitly given mean and variance. It is well-known that standard kernel smoothing leads to inconsistency problems at the boundary points. It turns out that, also by using a boundary correction, we can only establish uniform consistency on intervals that stay away from the end point of the support (though we can go arbitrarily close to the right boundary).
