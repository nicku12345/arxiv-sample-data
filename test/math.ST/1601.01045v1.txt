Here, we introduce a new class of Lindley generated distributions which results in more flexible model with increasing failure rate (IFR), decreasing failure rate(DFR) and up-side down hazard functions for different choices of parametric values. We explore, various distributional properties including limiting distribution of extreme order statistics explored. Maximum likelihood estimators and the confidence intervals of the parameters are obtained. The applicability of the proposed distribution is shown through modelling two sets of real data on bladder cancer patients and waiting time in a queue. Further, we carry out stress-strength analysis for applying the model in system reliability studies.
