This paper studies goodness of fit tests and specification tests for an extension of the log-GARCH model which is stable by scaling. A Lagrange-Multiplier test is derived for testing the null assumption of extended log-GARCH against more general formulations including the Exponential GARCH (EGARCH). The null assumption of an EGARCH is also tested. Portmanteau goodness-of-fit tests are developed for the extended log-GARCH. Simulations illustrating the theoretical results and an application to real financial data are proposed.
