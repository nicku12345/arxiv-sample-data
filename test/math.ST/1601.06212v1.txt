A massive dataset often consists of a growing number of (potentially) heterogeneous sub-populations. This paper is concerned about testing various forms of heterogeneity arising from massive data. In a general nonparametric framework, a set of testing procedures are designed to accommodate a growing number of sub-populations, denoted as s, with computational feasibility. In theory, their null limit distributions are derived as being nearly Chi-square with diverging degrees of freedom as long as s does not grow too fast. Interestingly, we find that a lower bound on s needs to be set for obtaining a sufficiently powerful testing result, so-called "blessing of aggregation." As a by-produc, a type of homogeneity testing is also proposed with a test statistic being aggregated over all sub-populations. Numerical results are presented to support our theory.
