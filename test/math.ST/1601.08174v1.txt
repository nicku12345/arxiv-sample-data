We consider the problem of the construction of the estimator-process of the unknown finite-dimensional parameter in the case of the observations of nonlinear autoregressive process. The estimation is done in two or three steps. First we estimate the unknown parameter by a learning relatively short part of observations and then we use the one-step MLE idea to construct an-estimator process which is asymptotically equivalent to the MLE. To have the learning interval shorter we introduce the two-step procedure which leads to the asymptotically efficient estimator-process too. The presented results are illustrated with the help of two numerical examples.
