We consider the problem of recovering linear image Bx of a signal x known to belong to a given convex compact set X from indirect observation \omega=Ax+\sigma\xi of x corrupted by Gaussian noise \xi. It is shown that under some assumptions on X (satisfied, e.g., when X is the intersection of K concentric ellipsoids/elliptic cylinders), an easy-to-compute linear estimate is near-optimal, in certain precise sense, in terms of its worst-case, over x\in X, expected \|\cdot\|_2^2-error. The main novelty here is that our results impose no restrictions on A and B, to the best of our knowledge, preceding results on optimality of linear estimates dealt either with the case of direct observations A=I and B=I, or with the "diagonal case" where A, B are diagonal and X is given by a "separable" constraint like X=\{x:\sum_ia_i^2x_i^2\leq 1\} or X=\{x:\max_i|a_ix_i|\leq1\}, or with estimating a linear form (i.e., the case one-dimensional Bx).
