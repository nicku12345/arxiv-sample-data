We consider two-sample tests for high-dimensional data under two disjoint models: the strongly spiked eigenvalue (SSE) model and the non-SSE (NSSE) model. We provide a general test statistic as a function of a positive-semidefinite matrix. We give sufficient conditions for the test statistic to satisfy a consistency property and to be asymptotically normal. We discuss an optimality of the test statistic under the NSSE model. We also investigate the test statistic under the SSE model by considering strongly spiked eigenstructures and create a new effective test procedure for the SSE model. Finally, we discuss the performance of the classifiers numerically.
