Many insurance premium principles are defined and various estimation procedures introduced in the literature. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the excess-of-loss reinsurance premium when the risks are randomly right-censored. The asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator is established under suitable conditions and its performance evaluated through sets of simulated data.
