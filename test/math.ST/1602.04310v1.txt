We observe n independent p-dimensional Gaussian vectors with missing coordinates, that is each value (which is assumed standardized) is observed with probability a>0. We investigate the problem of minimax nonparametric testing that the high-dimensional covariance matrix \Sigma of the underlying Gaussian distribution is the identity matrix, using these partially observed vectors. Here, n and p tend to infinity and a>0 tends to 0, asymptotically.   We assume that \Sigma belongs to a Sobolev-type ellipsoid with parameter \alpha >0. When \alpha is known, we give asymptotically minimax consistent test procedure and find the minimax separation rates \tilde \varphi_{n,p}= (a^2n \sqrt{p})^{- \frac{2 \alpha}{4 \alpha +1}}, under some additional constraints on n,\, p and a. We show that, in the particular case of Toeplitz covariance matrices,the minimax separation rates are faster, \tilde \phi_{n,p}= (a^2n p)^{- \frac{2 \alpha}{4 \alpha +1}}. We note how the "missingness" parameter a deteriorates the rates with respect to the case of fully observed vectors (a=1).   We also propose adaptive test procedures, that is free of the parameter \alpha in some interval, and show that the loss of rate is (\ln \ln (a^2 n\sqrt{p}))^{\alpha/(4 \alpha +1)} and (\ln \ln (a^2 n p))^{\alpha/(4 \alpha +1)} for Toeplitz covariance matrices, respectively.
