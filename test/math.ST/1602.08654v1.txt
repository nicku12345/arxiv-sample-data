We consider the structural change in a class of discrete valued time series that the conditional distribution follows a one-parameter exponential family. We propose a change-point test based on the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter of the model. Under the null hypothesis (of no change), the test statistics converges to a well known distribution, allowing for the calculation of the critical values of the test. The test statistic diverges to infinity under the alternative, that is, the test asymptotically has power one. Some simulation results and real data applications are reported to show the applicability of the test procedure.
