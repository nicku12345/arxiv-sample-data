In this paper, we consider a parametric density contamination model. We work with a sample of i.i.d. data with a common density, f^\star =(1-\lambda^\star) \phi + \lambda^\star \phi(.-\mu^\star), where the shape \phi is assumed to be known. We establish the optimal rates of convergence for the estimation of the mixture parameters (\lambda^\star,\mu^\star). In particular, we prove that the classical parametric rate 1/\sqrt{n} cannot be reached when at least one of these parameters is allowed to tend to 0 with n.
