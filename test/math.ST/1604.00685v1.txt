We derive a construction of the beta process that allows for the atoms with significant measure to be drawn first. Our representation is based on an extension of the Sethuraman (1994) construction of the Dirichlet process, and therefore we refer to it as a stick-breaking construction. Our first proof uses a limiting case argument of finite arrays. To this end, we present a finite sieve approximation to the beta process that parallels that of Ishwaran & Zarepour (2002) and prove its convergence to the beta process. We give a second proof of the construction using Poisson process machinery. We use the Poisson process to derive almost sure truncation bounds for the construction. We conclude the paper by presenting an efficient sampling algorithm for beta-Bernoulli and beta-negative binomial process models.
