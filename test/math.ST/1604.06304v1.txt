We study the problem of nonparametric estimation of density functions with a product form on the domain \triangle=\{( x_1, \ldots, x_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d, 0\leq x_1\leq \dots \leq x_d \leq 1\}. Such densities appear in the random truncation model as the joint density function of observations. They are also obtained as maximum entropy distributions of order statistics with given marginals. We propose an estimation method based on the approximation of the logarithm of the density by a carefully chosen family of basis functions. We show that the method achieves a fast convergence rate in probability with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence for densities whose logarithm belongs to a Sobolev function class with known regularity. In the case when the regularity is unknown, we propose an estimation procedure using convex aggregation of the log-densities to obtain adaptability. The performance of this method is illustrated in a simulation study.
