Under special conditions on data set and underlying distribution, the limit of finite sample breakdown point of Tukey's halfspace median (\frac{1} {3}) has been obtained in literature. In this paper, we establish the result under \emph{weaker assumption} imposed on underlying distribution (halfspace symmetry) and on data set (not necessary in general position). The representation of Tukey's sample depth regions for data set \emph{not necessary in general position} is also obtained, as a by-product of our derivation.
