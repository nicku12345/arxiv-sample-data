In this paper, we study the minimax rates and provide an implementable convex algorithm for Poisson inverse problems under weak sparsity and physical constraints. In particular we assume the model y_i \sim \mbox{Poisson}(Ta_i^{\top}f^*) for 1 \leq i \leq n where T \in \mathbb{R}_+ is the intensity, and we impose weak sparsity on f^* \in \mathbb{R}^p by assuming f^* lies in an \ell_q-ball when rotated according to an orthonormal basis D \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}. In addition, since we are modeling real physical systems we also impose positivity and flux-preserving constraints on the matrix A = [a_1, a_2,...,a_n]^{\top} and the function f^*. We prove minimax lower bounds for this model which scale as R_q (\frac{\log p}{T})^{1 - q/2} where it is noticeable that the rate depends on the intensity T and not the sample size n. We also show that a \ell_1-based regularized least-squares estimator achieves this minimax lower bound, provided a suitable restricted eigenvalue condition is satisfied. Finally we prove that provided n \geq \tilde{K} \log p where \tilde{K} = O(R_q (\frac{\log p}{T})^{- q/2}) represents an approximate sparsity level, our restricted eigenvalue condition and physical constraints are satisfied for random bounded ensembles. We also provide numerical experiments that validate our mean-squared error bounds. Our results address a number of open issues from prior work on Poisson inverse problems that focuses on strictly sparse models and does not provide guarantees for convex implementable algorithms.
