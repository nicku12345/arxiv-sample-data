We introduce and evaluate a new class of hypothesis testing procedures for moment structures. The methods are valid under weak assumptions and includes the well-known Satorra-Bentler adjustment as a special case. The proposed procedures applies also to difference testing among nested models. We prove the consistency of our approach. We introduce a bootstrap selection mechanism to optimally choose a p-value approximation for a given sample. Also, we propose bootstrap procedures for assessing the asymptotic robustness (AR) of the normal-theory maximum likelihood test, and for the key assumption underlying the Satorra-Bentler adjustment (Satorra-Bentler consistency). Simulation studies indicate that our new p-value approximations performs well even under severe nonnormality and realistic sample sizes, but that our tests for AR and Satorra-Bentler consistency require very large sample sizes to work well.
