This paper deals with studying vague convergence of random measures of the form \mu_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i,n} \delta_{\theta_i}, where (\theta_i)_{1\le i \le n} is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with common distribution \Pi, (p_{i,n})_{1 \le i \le n} are random variables chosen according to certain procedures and are independent of (\theta_i)_{i \geq 1} and \delta_{\theta_i} denotes the Dirac measure at \theta_i. We show that \mu_{n} converges vaguely to \mu=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} p_{i} \delta_{\theta_i} if and only if \mu^{(k)}_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i,n} \delta_{\theta_i} converges vaguely to \mu^{(k)}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} \delta_{\theta_i} for all k fixed. The limiting process \mu plays a central role in many areas in statistics, including Bayesian nonparametric models. A finite approximation of the beta process is derived from the application of this result. A simulated example is incorporated, in which the proposed approach exhibits an excellent performance over several existing algorithms.
