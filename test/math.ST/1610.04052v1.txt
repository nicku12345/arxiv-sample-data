We explore some properties of the conditional distribution of an i.i.d. sample under large exceedances of its sum. Thresholds for the asymptotic independance of the summands are observed, in contrast with the classical case when the conditioning event is in the range of a large deviation. This paper is an extension to [7]. Tools include a new Edgeworth expansion adapted to specific triangular arrays where the rows are generated by tilted distribution with diverging parameters, together with some Abelian type results.
