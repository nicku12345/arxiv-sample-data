We consider a one-dimensional diffusion whose drift contains a deterministic periodic signal with unknown periodicity T and carrying some unknown d-dimensional shape parameter \theta. We prove Local Asymptotic Normality (LAN) jointly in \theta and T for the statistical experiment arising from continuous observation of this diffusion. The local scale turns out to be n^{-1/2} for the shape parameter and n^{-3/2} for the periodicity which generalizes known results about LAN when either \theta or T is assumed to be known.
