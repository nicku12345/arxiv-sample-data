The problem of testing the goodness of fit of an absolutely continuous distribution to a set of observations grouped into equal probability intervals, against to a family of sequences of alternatives approaching the hypothesis is considered. We focus our study to the asymptotic intermediate efficiency (AIE) due to Inglot (1999) of the chi-squared and log-likelihood ratio tests. It is assumed that the number of groups increases together with the number of observations.
