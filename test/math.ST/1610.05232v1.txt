This paper proposes a generalized binomial distribution with four parameters, which is derived from the finite capacity queueing system with state-dependent service and arrival rates. This distribution is also generated from the conditional Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution given a sum of two Conway-Maxwell-Poisson variables. In this paper, we consider the properties about the probability mass function, index of dispersion, skewness and kurtosis and give applications of the proposed distribution from its geneses. The estimation method and simulation study are also considered.
