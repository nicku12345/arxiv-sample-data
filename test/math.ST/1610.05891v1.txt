The covariance function and the variogram play very important roles in modelling and in prediction of spatial and spatio-temporal data. The assumption of second order stationarity, in space and time, is often made in the analysis of spatial data and the spatio-temporal data. Several times the assumption of stationarity is considered to be very restrictive, and therefore, a weaker assumption that the data is Intrinsically stationary both in space and time is often made and used, mainly by the geo-statisticians and other environmental scientists. In this paper we consider the data to be intrinsically stationary. Because of the inclusion of time dimension,the estimation and derivation of the sampling properties of various estimators related to spatio-temporal data become complicated. In this paper our object is to present an alternative way, based on Frequency Domain methods for modelling the data. Here we consider Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) defined for the (Intrinsic) time series data observed at several locations as our data, and then consider the estimation of the parameters of spatio-temporal covariance function, estimation of Frequency Variogram, tests of independence etc. We use the well known property that the Discrete Fourier Transforms of stationary time series evaluated at distinct Fourier Frequencies are asymptotically independent and distributed as complex normal in deriving many results considered in this paper.
