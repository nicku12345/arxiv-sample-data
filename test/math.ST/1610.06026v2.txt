We study the monotone single index model where a real response variable Y  is linked to a d-dimensional covariate X through the relationship E[Y | X] = \Psi_0(\alpha^T_0 X) almost surely. Both the ridge function, \Psi_0, and the index parameter, \alpha_0, are unknown and the ridge function is assumed to be monotone on its interval of support. Under some regularity conditions, without imposing a particular distribution on the regression error, we show the n^{-1/3} rate of convergence in the \ell_2-norm for the least squares estimator of the bundled function \psi_0({\alpha}^T_0 \cdot), and also that of the ridge function and the index separately. Furthermore, we show that the least squares estimator is nearly parametrically rate-adaptive to piecewise constant ridge functions.
