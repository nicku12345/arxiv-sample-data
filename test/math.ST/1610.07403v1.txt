We present a new methodology for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation in function-on-scalar regression with an ultra-high dimensional predictor vector. We extend the LASSO to functional data in both the \textit{dense} functional setting and the \textit{sparse} functional setting. We provide theoretical guarantees which allow for an exponential number of predictor variables. Simulations are carried out which illustrate the methodology and compare the sparse/functional methods. Using the Framingham Heart Study, we demonstrate how our tools can be used in genome-wide association studies, finding a number of genetic mutations which affect blood pressure and are therefore important for cardiovascular health.
