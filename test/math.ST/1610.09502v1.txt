This paper deals with a class of nonparametric two-sample tests for ordered alternatives. The test statistics proposed are based on the number of observations from one sample that precede or exceed a threshold specified by the other sample, and they are extensions of \v{S}id\'ak's test. We derive their exact null distributions and also discuss a large-sample approximation. We then study their power properties exactly against the Lehmann alternative and make some comparative comments. Finally, we present an example to illustrate the proposed tests.
