We consider the Wiener process with drift  dX_t=\mu dt +\sigma d W_t  with initial value problem X_0=x_0, where x_0 \in R,  \mu \in R and \sigma > 0 are parameters. By use values (z_k)_{k \in N} of corresponding trajectories at a fixed positive moment t, the infinite-sample consistent estimates of each unknown parameter of the Wiener process with drift are constructed under assumption that all another parameters are known. Further, we propose a certain approach for estimation of unknown parameters x_0,\mu,\sigma of the Wiener process with drift by use the values (z^{(1)}_k)_{k \in N} and (z^{(2)}_k)_{k \in N} being the results of observations on the 2k-th and 2k+1-th trajectories of the Wiener process with drift at moments t_1 and t_2 , respectively.
