We consider method-of-quantiles estimators of unknown parameters, namely the analogue of method-of-moments estimators obtained by matching empirical and theoretical quantiles at some probability level lambda in (0,1). The aim is to present large deviation results for these estimators as the sample size tends to infinity. We study in detail several examples; for specific models we discuss the choice of the optimal value of lambda and we compare the convergence of the method-of-quantiles and method-of-moments estimators.
