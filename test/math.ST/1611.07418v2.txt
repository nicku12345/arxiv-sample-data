Robustness to outliers is often a desirable property of statistical estimators. Indeed many well known estimators offer very good optimal performance in theory but are unusable in applied contexts because of their sensitivity to outliers. Of particular interest to the authors is the case of covariance estimators in adaptive matched filtering schemes in signal processing applications such as RADAR and SONAR detection, for which a contamination by outliers of the estimated noise covariance can lead to a great impact on performances, in particular when these outliers are similar to the target signal of the matched filter.   This paper presents a generic method for building partial estimators from known estimators, which aim at avoiding these issues; the resulting algorithms are shown for a few chosen cases.
