The Fisher information matrix (FIM) plays an important role in the analysis of parameter inference and system design problems. In a number of cases, however, the statistical data distribution and its associated information matrix are either unknown or intractable. For this reason, it is of interest to develop useful lower bounds on the FIM. In this lecture note, we derive such a bound based on moment constraints. We call this bound the Pearson information matrix (PIM) and relate it to properties of a misspecified data distribution. Finally, we show that the inverse PIM coincides with the asymptotic covariance matrix of the optimally weighted generalized method of moments.
