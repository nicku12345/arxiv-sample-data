We study nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of a log-concave density function f_0 which is known to satisfy further constraints, where either (a) the mode m of f_0 is known, or (b) f_0 is known to be symmetric about a fixed point m. We develop asymptotic theory for both constrained log-concave maximum likelihood estimators (MLE's), including consistency, global rates of convergence, and local limit distribution theory. In both cases, we find the MLE's pointwise limit distribution at m (either the known mode or the known center of symmetry) and at a point x_0 \ne m. Software to compute the constrained estimators is available in the R package \verb+logcondens.mode+.   The symmetry-constrained MLE is particularly useful in contexts of location estimation. The mode-constrained MLE is useful for mode-regression. The mode-constrained MLE can also be used to form a likelihood ratio test for the location of the mode of f_0. These problems are studied in separate papers. In particular, in a separate paper we show that, under a curvature assumption, the likelihood ratio statistic for the location of the mode can be used for hypothesis tests or confidence intervals that do not depend on either tuning parameters or nuisance parameters.
