In this article we present a Bernstein inequality for sums of random variables which are defined on a graphical network whose nodes grow at an exponential rate. The inequality can be used to derive concentration inequalities in highly-connected networks. It can be useful to obtain consistency properties for nonparametric estimators of conditional expectation functions which are derived from such networks.
