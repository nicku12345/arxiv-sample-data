The probability density quantile (pdQ) carries essential information regarding shape and tail behavior of a location-scale family. Convergence of repeated applications of the pdQ mapping to the uniform distribution is investigated and new fixed point theorems are established. The Kullback-Leibler divergences from uniformity of these pdQs are mapped and found to be ingredients in power functions of optimal tests for uniformity against alternative shapes.
