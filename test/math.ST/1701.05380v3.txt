We give a new large deviation inequality for sums of random variables of the form Z_k = f(X_k,X_t) for k,t\in \mathbb{N}, t fixed, where the underlying process X is \beta-mixing. The inequality can be used to derive concentration inequalities. We demonstrate its usefulness in the functional kernel regression model of Ferraty et al. (2007) where we study the consistency of dynamic forecasts.
