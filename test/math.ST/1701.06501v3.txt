Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have wide-ranging applications in machine learning, where they are used to enforce the notion of diversity in subset selection problems. Many estimators have been proposed, but surprisingly the basic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) have received little attention. The difficulty is that it is a non-concave maximization problem, and such functions are notoriously difficult to understand in high dimensions, despite their importance in modern machine learning. Here we study both the local and global geometry of the expected log-likelihood function. We prove several rates of convergence for the MLE and give a complete characterization of the case where these are parametric. We also exhibit a potential curse of dimensionality where the asymptotic variance of the MLE scales exponentially with the dimension of the problem. Moreover, we exhibit an exponential number of saddle points, and give evidence that these may be the only critical points.
