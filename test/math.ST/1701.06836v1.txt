Dimension reduction is often a preliminary step in the analysis of large data sets. The so-called non-Gaussian component analysis searches for a projection onto the non-Gaussian part of the data, and it is then important to know the correct dimension of the non-Gaussian signal subspace. In this paper we develop asymptotic as well as bootstrap tests for the dimension based on the popular fourth order blind identification (FOBI) method.
