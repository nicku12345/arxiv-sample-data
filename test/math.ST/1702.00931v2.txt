Stochastic gradient algorithms are more and more studied since they can deal efficiently and online with large samples in high dimensional spaces. In this paper, we first establish a Central Limit Theorem for these estimates as well as for their averaged version in general Hilbert spaces. Moreover, since having the asymptotic normality of estimates is often unusable without an estimation of the asymptotic variance, we introduce a new recursive algorithm for estimating this last one, and we establish its almost sure rate of convergence as well as its rate of convergence in quadratic mean. Finally, two examples consisting in estimating the parameters of the logistic regression and estimating geometric quantiles are given.
