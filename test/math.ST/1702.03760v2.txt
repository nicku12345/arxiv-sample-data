We consider composite-composite testing problems for the expectation in the Gaussian sequence model where the null hypothesis corresponds to a convex subset \mathcal{C} of \mathbb{R}^d. We adopt a minimax point of view and our primary objective is to describe the smallest Euclidean distance between the null and alternative hypotheses such that there is a test with small total error probability. In particular, we focus on the dependence of this distance on the dimension d and the sample size/variance parameter n giving rise to the minimax separation rate. In this paper we discuss lower and upper bounds on this rate for different smooth and non- smooth choices for \mathcal{C}.
