It is shown that Newton's inequalities and the related Maclaurin's inequalities provide several refinements of the fundamental Arithmetic mean - Geometric mean - Harmonic mean inequality in terms of the means and variance of positive real numbers. We also obtain some inequalities involving third and fourth central moments of real numbers.
