This work is closely related to the theories of set estimation and manifold estimation.   Our object of interest is a, possibly lower-dimensional, compact set S   \subset {\mathbb R}^d.   The general aim is to identify (via stochastic procedures) some qualitative or quantitative features of S, of geometric or topological character. The available information is just a random sample of points drawn on S.   The term "to identify" means here to achieve a correct answer almost surely (a.s.) when the sample size tends to infinity. More specifically the paper aims at giving some partial answers to the following questions: is S full dimensional? Is S "close to a lower dimensional set" \mathcal{M}? If so, can we estimate \mathcal{M} or some functionals of \mathcal{M} (in particular, the Minkowski content of \mathcal{M})? As an important auxiliary tool in the answers of these questions, a denoising procedure is proposed in order to partially remove the noise in the original data. The theoretical results are complemented with some simulations and graphical illustrations.
