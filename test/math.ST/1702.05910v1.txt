We determine the joint limiting distribution of adjacent spacings around a central, intermediate, or an extreme order statistic X_{k:n} of a random sample of size n from a continuous distribution F. For central and intermediate cases, normalized spacings in the left and right neighborhoods are asymptotically i.i.d. exponential random variables. The associated independent Poisson arrival processes are independent of X_{k:n}. For an extreme X_{k:n}, the asymptotic independence property of spacings fails for F in the domain of attraction of Fr\'{e}chet and Weibull (\alpha \neq 1) distributions. This work also provides additional insight into the limiting distribution for the number of observations around X_{k:n} for all three cases.
