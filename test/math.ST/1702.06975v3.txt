We consider the recovery of a low rank M \times N matrix S from its noisy observation \tilde{S} in two different regimes. Under the assumption that M is comparable to N, we propose two consistent estimators for S. Our analysis relies on the local behavior of the large dimensional rectangular matrices with finite rank perturbation. We also derive the convergent limits and rates for the singular values and vectors of such matrices.
