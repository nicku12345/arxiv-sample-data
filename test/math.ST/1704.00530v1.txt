For a multinormal distribution with a p-dimensional mean vector {\mbtheta} and an arbitrary unknown dispersion matrix {\mbSigma}, Rao ([9], [10]) proposed two tests for the problem of testing  H_{0}:{\mbtheta}_{1} = {\bf 0}, {\mbtheta}_{2} = {\bf 0}, {\mbSigma}~ \hbox{unspecified},~\hbox{versus}~H_{1}:{\mbtheta}_{1} \ne {\bf 0}, {\mbtheta}_{2} ={\bf 0}, {\mbSigma}~\hbox{unspecified}, where {\mbtheta}^{'}=({\mbtheta}^{'}_{1},{\mbtheta}^{'}_{2}). These tests are referred to as Rao's W-test (likelihood ratio test) and Rao's U-test (union-intersection test), respectively. This work is inspired by the well-known work of Marden and Perlman [6] who claimed that Hotelling's T^{2}-test is admissible while Rao's U-test is inadmissible. Both Rao's U-test and Hotelling's T^{2}-test can be constructed by applying the union-intersection principle that incorporates the information {\mbtheta}_{2}={\bf 0} for Rao's U-test statistic but does not incorporate it for Hotelling's T^{2}-test statistic. Rao's U-test is believed to exhibit some optimal properties. Rao's U-test is shown to be admissible by fully incorporating the information {\mbtheta}_{2}={\bf 0}, but Hotelling's T^{2}-test is inadmissible.
