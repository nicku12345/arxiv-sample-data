Consider a Gaussian vector \mathbf{z}=(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{y}')', consisting of two sub-vectors \mathbf{x} and \mathbf{y} with dimensions p and q respectively, where both p and q are proportional to the sample size n. Denote by \Sigma_{\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}} the population cross-covariance matrix of random vectors \mathbf{u} and \mathbf{v}, and denote by S_{\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}} the sample counterpart. The canonical correlation coefficients between \mathbf{x} and \mathbf{y} are known as the square roots of the nonzero eigenvalues of the canonical correlation matrix \Sigma_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{x}}^{-1}\Sigma_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y}}\Sigma_{\mathbf{y}\mathbf{y}}^{-1}\Sigma_{\mathbf{y}\mathbf{x}}. In this paper, we focus on the case that \Sigma_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y}} is of finite rank k, i.e. there are k nonzero canonical correlation coefficients, whose squares are denoted by r_1\geq\cdots\geq r_k>0. We study the sample counterparts of r_i,i=1,\ldots,k, i.e. the largest k eigenvalues of the sample canonical correlation matrix \S_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{x}}^{-1}\S_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y}}\S_{\mathbf{y}\mathbf{y}}^{-1}\S_{\mathbf{y}\mathbf{x}}, denoted by \lambda_1\geq\cdots\geq \lambda_k. We show that there exists a threshold r_c\in(0,1), such that for each i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}, when r_i\leq r_c, \lambda_i converges almost surely to the right edge of the limiting spectral distribution of the sample canonical correlation matrix, denoted by d_{+}. When r_i>r_c, \lambda_i possesses an almost sure limit in (d_{+},1]. We also obtain the limiting distribution of \lambda_i's under appropriate normalization. Specifically, \lambda_i possesses Gaussian type fluctuation if r_i>r_c, and follows Tracy-Widom distribution if r_i<r_c. Some applications of our results are also discussed.
