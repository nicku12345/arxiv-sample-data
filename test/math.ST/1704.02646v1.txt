We consider the sparse high-dimensional linear regression model Y=Xb+\epsilon where b is a sparse vector. For the Bayesian approach to this problem, many authors have considered the behavior of the posterior distribution when, in truth, Y=X\beta+\epsilon for some given \beta. There have been numerous results about the rate at which the posterior distribution concentrates around \beta, but few results about the shape of that posterior distribution. We propose a prior distribution for b such that the marginal posterior distribution of an individual coordinate b_i is asymptotically normal centered around an asymptotically efficient estimator, under the truth. Such a result gives Bayesian credible intervals that match with the confidence intervals obtained from an asymptotically efficient estimator for b_i. We also discuss ways of obtaining such asymptotically efficient estimators on individual coordinates. We compare the two-step procedure proposed by Zhang and Zhang (2014) and a one-step modified penalization method.
