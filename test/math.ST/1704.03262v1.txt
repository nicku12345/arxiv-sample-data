In this paper we introduce a modified version of a gaussian standard first-order autoregressive process where we allow for a dependence structure between the state variable Y_{t-1} and the next innovation \xi_t. We call this model dependent innovations gaussian AR(1) process (DIG-AR(1)). We analyze the moment and temporal dependence properties of the new model. After proving that the OLS estimator does not consistently estimate the autoregressive parameter, we introduce an infeasible estimator and we provide its \sqrt{T}-asymptotic normality.
