Let X_1, \ldots, X_n\in\mathbb{R}^p be i.i.d. random vectors. We aim to perform simultaneous inference for the mean vector \mathbb{E} (X_i) with finite polynomial moments and an ultra high dimension. Our approach is based on the truncated sample mean vector. A Gaussian approximation result is derived for the latter under the very mild finite polynomial ((2+\theta)-th) moment condition and the dimension p can be allowed to grow exponentially with the sample size n. Based on this result, we propose an innovative resampling method to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for mean vectors.
