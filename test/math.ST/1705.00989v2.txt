Given an n-sample drawn on a submanifold M \subset \mathbb{R}^D, we derive optimal rates for the estimation of tangent spaces T\_X M, the second fundamental form II\_X^M, and the submanifold M.After motivating their study, we introduce a quantitative class of \mathcal{C}^k-submanifolds in analogy with H{\"o}lder classes.The proposed estimators are based on local polynomials and allow to deal simultaneously with the three problems at stake. Minimax lower bounds are derived using a conditional version of Assouad's lemma when the base point X is random.
