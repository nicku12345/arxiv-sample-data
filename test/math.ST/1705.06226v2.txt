Functional data analysis on nonlinear manifolds has drawn recent interest. Sphere-valued functional data, which are encountered for example as movement trajectories on the surface of the earth, are an important special case. We consider an intrinsic principal component analysis for smooth Riemannian manifold-valued functional data and study its asymptotic properties. Riemannian functional principal component analysis (RFPCA) is carried out by first mapping the manifold-valued data through Riemannian logarithm maps to tangent spaces around the time-varying Fr\'echet mean function, and then performing a classical multivariate functional principal component analysis on the linear tangent spaces. Representations of the Riemannian manifold-valued functions and the eigenfunctions on the original manifold are then obtained with exponential maps. The tangent-space approximation through functional principal component analysis is shown to be well-behaved in terms of controlling the residual variation if the Riemannian manifold has nonnegative curvature. Specifically, we derive a central limit theorem for the mean function, as well as root-n uniform convergence rates for other model components, including the covariance function, eigenfunctions, and functional principal component scores. Our applications include a novel framework for the analysis of longitudinal compositional data, achieved by mapping longitudinal compositional data to trajectories on the sphere, illustrated with longitudinal fruit fly behavior patterns. RFPCA is shown to be superior in terms of trajectory recovery in comparison to an unrestricted functional principal component analysis in applications and simulations and is also found to produce principal component scores that are better predictors for classification compared to traditional functional functional principal component scores.
