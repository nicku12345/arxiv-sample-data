We discuss an "operational" approach to testing convex composite hypotheses when the underlying distributions are heavy-tailed. It relies upon Euclidean separation of convex sets and can be seen as an extension of the approach to testing by convex optimization developed in [8, 12]. In particular, we show how one can construct quasi-optimal testing procedures for families of distributions which are majorated, in a certain precise sense, by a sub-spherical symmetric one and study the relationship between tests based on Euclidean separation and "potential-based tests." We apply the promoted methodology in the problem of sequential detection and illustrate its practical implementation in an application to sequential detection of changes in the input of a dynamic system.
