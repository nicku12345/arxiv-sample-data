Multivariate generalized Pareto distributions arise as the limit distributions of exceedances over multivariate thresholds of random vectors in the domain of attraction of a max-stable distribution. These distributions can be parametrized and represented in a number of different ways. Moreover, generalized Pareto distributions enjoy a number of interesting stability properties. An overview of the main features of such distributions are given, expressed compactly in several parametrizations, giving the potential user of these distributions a convenient catalogue of ways to handle and work with generalized Pareto distributions.
