We present a simple result that allows us to evaluate the asymptotic order of the remainder of a partial asymptotic expansion of the quantile function h(u) as u\to 0^+ or 1^-. This is focussed on important univariate distributions when h(\cdot) has no simple closed form, with a view to assessing asymptotic rate of decay to zero of tail dependence in the context of bivariate copulas. The Introduction motivates the study in terms of the standard Normal. The Normal, Skew-Normal and Gamma are used as initial examples. Finally, we discuss approximation to the lower quantile of the Variance-Gamma and Skew-Slash distributions.
