Given a low frequency sample of an infinitely divisible moving average random field \{\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f(x-t)\Lambda(dx); \ t \in \mathbb{R}^d \} with a known simple function f, we study the problem of nonparametric estimation of the L\'{e}vy characteristics of the independently scattered random measure \Lambda. We provide three methods, a simple plug-in approach, a method based on Fourier transforms and an approach involving decompositions with respect to L^2-orthonormal bases, which allow to estimate the L\'{e}vy density of \Lambda. For these methods, the bounds for the L^2-error are given. Their numerical performance is compared in a simulation study.
