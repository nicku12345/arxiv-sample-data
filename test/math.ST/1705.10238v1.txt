Although proportional hazard rate model is a very popular model to analyze failure time data, sometimes it becomes important to study the additive hazard rate model. Again, sometimes the concept of the hazard rate function is abstract, in comparison to the concept of mean residual life function. A new model called `dynamic additive mean residual life model' where the covariates are time-dependent has been defined in the literature. Here we study the closure properties of the model for different positive and negative ageing classes under certain condition(s). Quite a few examples are presented to illustrate different properties of the model.
