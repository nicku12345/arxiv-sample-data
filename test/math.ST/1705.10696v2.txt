Upper and lower bounds are derived for the Gaussian mean width of the intersection of a convex hull of M points with an Euclidean ball of a given radius. The upper bound holds for any collection of extreme point bounded in Euclidean norm. The upper bound and the lower bound match up to a multiplicative constant whenever the extreme points satisfy a one sided Restricted Isometry Property.   This bound is then applied to study the Lasso estimator in fixed-design regression, the Empirical Risk Minimizer in the anisotropic persistence problem, and the convex aggregation problem in density estimation.
