Classical results of Chentsov and Campbell state that -- up to constant multiples -- the only 2-tensor field of a statistical model which is invariant under congruent Markov morphisms is the Fisher metric and the only invariant 3-tensor field is the Amari-Chentsov tensor. We generalize this result for arbitrary degree n, showing that any family of n-tensors which is invariant under congruent Markov morphisms is algebraically generated by the canonical tensor fields defined in an earlier paper.
