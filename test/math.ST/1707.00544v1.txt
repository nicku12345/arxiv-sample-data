We derive estimators of the density of the event times of current status data. The estimators are derived for the situations where the distribution of the observation times is known and where this distribution is unknown. The density estimators are constructed from kernel estimators of the density of transformed current status data, which have a distribution similar to uniform deconvolution data. Expansions of the expectation and variance as well as asymptotic normality are derived. A reference density based bandwidth selection method is proposed. A simulated example is presented.
