The t-distribution has many useful applications in robust statistical analysis. The parameter estimation of the t-distribution is carried out using ML estimation method, and the ML estimates are obtained via the EM algorithm. In this study, we consider an alternative estimation method for all the parameters of the multivariate-t distribution using the MLq estimation method. We adapt the EM algorithm to obtain the MLq estimates for all the parameters. We provide a small simulation study to illustrate the performance of the MLq estimators over the ML estimators and observe that the MLq estimators have considerable superiority over the ML estimators.
