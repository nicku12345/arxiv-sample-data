We study the problem of matrix estimation and matrix completion under a general framework. This framework includes several important models as special cases such as the gaussian mixture model, mixed membership model, bi-clustering model and dictionary learning. We consider the optimal convergence rates in a minimax sense for estimation of the signal matrix under the Frobenius norm and under the spectral norm. As a consequence of our general result we obtain minimax optimal rates of convergence for various special models.
