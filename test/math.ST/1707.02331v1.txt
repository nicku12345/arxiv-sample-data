In this study, we propose shrinkage methods based on {\it generalized ridge regression} (GRR) estimation which is suitable for both multicollinearity and high dimensional problems with small number of samples (large p, small n). Also, it is obtained theoretical properties of the proposed estimators for Low/High Dimensional cases. Furthermore, the performance of the listed estimators is demonstrated by both simulation studies and real-data analysis, and compare its performance with existing penalty methods. We show that the proposed methods compare well to competing regularization techniques.
