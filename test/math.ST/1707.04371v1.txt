Learning the model parameters of a multi-object dynamical system from partial and perturbed observations is a challenging task. Despite recent numerical advancements in learning these parameters, theoretical guarantees are extremely scarce. In this article, we study the identifiability of these parameters and the consistency of the corresponding maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) under assumptions on the different components of the underlying multi-object system. In order to understand the impact of the various sources of observation noise on the ability to learn the model parameters, we study the asymptotic variance of the MLE through the associated Fisher information matrix. For example, we show that specific aspects of the multi-target tracking (MTT) problem such as detection failures and unknown data association lead to a loss of information which is quantified in special cases of interest.
