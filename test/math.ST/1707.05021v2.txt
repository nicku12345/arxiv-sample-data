Let B = \left\{ B\left( x\right),\, x\in \mathbb{S}^{2}\right\}  be the fractional Brownian motion indexed by the unit sphere \mathbb{S}^{2} with index 0<H\leq \frac{1}{2}, introduced by Istas \cite{IstasECP05}. We establish optimal estimates for its angular power spectrum \{d_\ell, \ell = 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}, and then exploit its high-frequency behavior to establish the property of its strong local nondeterminism of B.
