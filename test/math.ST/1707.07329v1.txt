We consider the problem of optimal estimation of the value of a vector parameter \thetavector=(\theta_0,\ldots,\theta_n)^{\top} of the drift term in a fractional Brownian motion represented by the finite sum \sum_{i=0}^{n}\theta_{i}\varphi_{i}(t) over known functions \varphi_i(t), \alli. For the value of parameter \thetavector, we obtain a maximum likelihood estimate as well as Bayesian estimates for normal and uniform a priori distributions.
