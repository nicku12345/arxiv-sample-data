We derive representation theorems for exchangeable distributions on finite and infinite graphs using elementary arguments based on geometric and graph-theoretic concepts. Our results elucidate some of the key differences, and their implications, between statistical network models that are finitely exchangeable and models that define a consistent sequence of probability distributions on graphs of increasing size.
