In this paper a new long-term survival distribution is proposed. The so called long term Fr\'echet distribution allows us to fit data where a part of the population is not susceptible to the event of interest. This model may be used, for example, in clinical studies where a portion of the population can be cured during a treatment. It is shown an account of mathematical properties of the new distribution such as its moments and survival properties. As well is presented the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for the parameters. A numerical simulation is carried out in order to verify the performance of the MLEs. Finally, an important application related to the leukemia free-survival times for transplant patients are discussed to illustrates our proposed distribution
