We study the problem of stationarity and ergodicity for autoregressive multinomial logistic time series models which possibly include a latent process and are defined by a GARCH-type recursive equation. We improve considerably upon the existing results related to stationarity and ergodicity conditions of such models. Proofs are based on theory developed for chains with complete connections. This approach is based on a useful coupling technique which is utilized for studying ergodicity of more general finite-state stochastic processes. Such processes generalize finite-state Markov chains by assuming infinite order models of past values. For finite order Markov chains, we also discuss ergodicity properties when some strongly exogenous covariates are considered in the dynamics of the process.
