The concept of \phi-complete mixability and \phi-joint mixability was first introduced in Bignozzi and Puccetti (2015), which is a direct extension of complete and joint mixability. Following Bignozzi and Puccetti (2015), we consider two cases of \phi and investigate the \phi-joint mixability for elliptical distributions and logarithmic elliptical distributions. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the \phi-joint mixability of some distributions and a sufficient condition for uniqueness of the center of \phi-joint mixability for some elliptical distributions.
