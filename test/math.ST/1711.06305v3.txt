The topic of this paper is modeling and analyzing dependence in stochastic social networks. Using a latent variable block model allows the analysis of dependence between blocks via the analysis of a latent graphical model. Our approach to the analysis of the graphical model then is based on the idea underlying the neighborhood selection scheme put forward by Meinshausen and B\"{u}hlmann (2006). However, because of the latent nature of our model, estimates have to be used in lieu of the unobserved variables. This leads to a novel analysis of graphical models under uncertainty, in the spirit of Rosenbaum et al. (2010), or Belloni et al. (2017). Lasso-based selectors, and a class of Dantzig-type selectors are studied.
