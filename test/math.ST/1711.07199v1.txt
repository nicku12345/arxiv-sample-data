We generalize a recent class of tests for univariate normality that are based on the empirical moment generating function to the multivariate setting, thus obtaining a class of affine invariant, consistent and easy-to-use goodness-of-fit tests for multinormality. The test statistics are suitably weighted L^2-statistics, and we provide their asymptotic behavior both for i.i.d. observations as well as in the context of testing that the innovation distribution of a multivariate GARCH model is Gaussian. We study the finite-sample behavior of the new tests, compare the criteria with alternative existing procedures, and apply the new procedure to a data set of monthly log returns.
