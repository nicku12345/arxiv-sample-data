In this paper we are interested in multifractional stable processes where the self-similarity index H is a function of time, in other words H becomes time changing, and the stability index \alpha is a constant. Using \beta- negative power variations (-1/2<\beta<0), we propose estimators for the value of the multifractional function H at a fixed time t_0 and for \alpha for two cases: multifractional Brownian motion (\alpha=2) and linear multifractional stable motion (0<\alpha<2). We get the consistency of our estimates for the underlying processes with the rate of convergence.
