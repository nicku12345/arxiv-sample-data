In this paper a new distribution is proposed. This new model provides more flexibility to modeling data with upside-down bathtub hazard rate function. A significant account of mathematical properties of the new distribution is presented. The maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters in the presence of complete and censored data are presented. Two corrective approaches are considered to derive modified estimators that are bias-free to second order. A numerical simulation is carried out to examine the efficiency of the bias correction. Finally, an application using a real data set is presented in order to illustrate our proposed distribution.
