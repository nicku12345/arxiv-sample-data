To address the problem of multicollinearity in the logistic regression model, in this paper we propose a new estimator called Stochastic restricted almost unbiased logistic Liu-estimator (SRAULLE) when the prior information is available in the form of stochastic linear restrictions. A Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out to compare the performance of the proposed estimator with some existing estimators in the scalar mean squared error (SMSE) sense. Finally, a real data example was given to appraise the performance of the estimators.
