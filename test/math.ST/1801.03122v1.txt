Doob's theorem provides guarantees of consistent estimation and posterior consistency under very general conditions. Despite the limitation that it only guarantees consistency on a set with prior probability 1, for many models arising in practice, Doob's theorem is an easy way of showing that consistency will hold almost everywhere. In this article, we give a detailed proof of Doob's theorem.
