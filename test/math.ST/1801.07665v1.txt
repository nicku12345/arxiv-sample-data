We answer an open question posed by the second author at the Salzburg workshop on Dependence Models and Copulas in 2016 concerning the size of the family \mathcal{A}^\rho_v (\mathcal{A}^\tau_v) of all Pickands dependence functions A whose corresponding Extreme-Value-Copulas have Spearman \rho (Kendall \tau) equal to some arbitrary, fixed value v \in [0,1]. After determining compact sets \Omega^\rho_v, \Omega^\tau_v \subseteq [0,1] \times [\frac{1}{2},1] containing the graphs of all Pickands dependence functions from the classes \mathcal{A}^\rho_v and \mathcal{A}^\tau_v respectively, we then show that both sets are best possible.
