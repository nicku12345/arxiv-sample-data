This work derives new results on strong consistent estimation and prediction for autoregressive processes of order 1 in a separable Banach space B. The consistency results are obtained for the componentwise estimator of the autocorrelation operator in the norm of the space \mathcal{L}(B) of bounded linear operators on B. The strong consistency of the associated plug-in predictor then follows in the B-norm. A Gelfand triple is defined through the Hilbert space constructed in Kuelbs' Lemma \cite{Kuelbs70}. A Hilbert--Schmidt embedding introduces the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), generated by the autocovariance operator, into the Hilbert space conforming the Rigged Hilbert space structure. This paper extends the work of \cite{Bosq00} and \cite{LabbasMourid02}.
