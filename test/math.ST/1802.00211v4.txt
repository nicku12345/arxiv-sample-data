We extend Hoeffding's lemma to general-state-space and not necessarily reversible Markov chains. Let \{X_i\}_{i \ge 1} be a stationary Markov chain with invariant measure \pi and absolute spectral gap 1-\lambda, where \lambda is defined as the operator norm of the transition kernel acting on mean zero and square-integrable functions with respect to \pi. Then, for any bounded functions f_i: x \mapsto [a_i,b_i], the sum of f_i(X_i) is sub-Gaussian with variance proxy \frac{1+\lambda}{1-\lambda} \cdot \sum_i \frac{(b_i-a_i)^2}{4}. This result differs from the classical Hoeffding's lemma by a multiplicative coefficient of (1+\lambda)/(1-\lambda), and simplifies to the latter when \lambda = 0. The counterpart of Hoeffding's inequality for Markov chains immediately follows. Our results assume none of countable state space, reversibility and time-homogeneity of Markov chains and cover time-dependent functions with various ranges. We illustrate the utility of these results by applying them to six problems in statistics and machine learning.
