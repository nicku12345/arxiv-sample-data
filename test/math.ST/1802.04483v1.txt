In this paper, we first describe the generalized notion of Cramer-Rao lower bound obtained by Naudts (2004) using two families of probability density functions, the original model and an escort model. We reinterpret the results in Naudts (2004) from a statistical point of view and obtain some interesting examples in which this bound is attained. Further we obtain information inequalities which generalize the classical Bhattacharyya bounds in both regular and non-regular cases.
