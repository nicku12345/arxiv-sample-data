We consider inference in the scalar diffusion model dX_t=b(X_t)dt+\sigma(X_t)dW_t with discrete data (X_{j\Delta_n})_{0\leq j \leq n}, n\to \infty,~\Delta_n\to 0 and periodic coefficients. For \sigma given, we prove a general theorem detailing conditions under which Bayesian posteriors will contract in L^2-distance around the true drift function b_0 at the frequentist minimax rate (up to logarithmic factors) over Besov smoothness classes. We exhibit natural nonparametric priors which satisfy our conditions. Our results show that the Bayesian method adapts both to an unknown sampling regime and to unknown smoothness.
