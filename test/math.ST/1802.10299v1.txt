In this paper, we derive the limit distribution of the least squares estimator for an AR(1) model with a non-zero intercept and a possible infinite variance. It turns out that the estimator has a quite different limit for the cases of |\rho| < 1, |\rho| > 1, and \rho = 1 + \frac{c}{n^\alpha} for some constant c \in R and \alpha \in (0, 1], and whether or not the variance of the model errors is infinite also has a great impact on both the convergence rate and the limit distribution of the estimator.
