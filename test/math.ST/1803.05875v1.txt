This paper extends the successful maxiset paradigm from function estimation to signal detection in inverse problems. In this context, the maxisets do not have the same shape compared to the classical estimation framework. Nevertheless, we introduce a robustified version of these maxisets, allowing to exhibit tail conditions on the signals of interest. Under this novel paradigm we are able to compare direct and indirect testing procedures.
