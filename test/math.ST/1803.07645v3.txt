Smoothing splines can be thought of as the posterior mean of a Gaussian process regression in a certain limit. By constructing a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with an appropriate inner product, the Bayesian form of the V-spline is derived when the penalty term is a fixed constant instead of a function. An extension to the usual generalized cross-validation formula is utilized to find the optimal V-spline parameters.
