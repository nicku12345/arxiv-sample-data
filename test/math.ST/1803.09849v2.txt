A compound Poisson process whose jump measure and intensity are unknown is observed at finitely many equispaced times. We construct a purely data-driven estimator of the L\'evy density \nu through the spectral approach using general Calderon--Zygmund integral operators, which include convolution and projection kernels. Assuming minimal tail assumptions, it is shown to estimate \nu at the minimax rate of estimation over Besov balls under the losses L^p(\mathbb{R}), p\in[1,\infty], and robustly to the observation regime (high- and low-frequency). To achieve adaptation in a minimax sense, we use Lepski\u{i}'s method as it is particularly well-suited for our generality. Thus, novel exponential-concentration inequalities are proved including one for the uniform fluctuations of the empirical characteristic function. These are of independent interest, as are the proof-strategies employed to deal with general Calderon--Zygmund operators, to depart from the ubiquitous quadratic structure and to show robustness without polynomial-tail conditions. Part of the motivation for such generality is a new insight we include here too that, furthermore, allows us to unify the main two approaches to construct estimators used in related literature.
