This paper develops the limit theory of the GARCH(1,1) process that moderately deviates from IGARCH process towards both stationary and explosive regimes. The GARCH(1,1) process is defined by equations u_t = \sigma_t \varepsilon_t, \sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha_n u_{t-1}^2 + \beta_n\sigma_{t-1}^2 and \alpha_n + \beta_n approaches to unity as sample size goes to infinity. The asymptotic theory developed in this paper extends Berkes et al. (2005) by allowing the parameters to have a slower convergence rate. The results can be applied to unit root test for processes with mildly-integrated GARCH innovations (e.g. Boswijk (2001), Cavaliere and Taylor (2007, 2009)) and deriving limit theory of estimators for models involving mildly-integrated GARCH processes (e.g. Jensen and Rahbek (2004), Francq and Zako\"ian (2012, 2013)).
