We observe a stochastic process Y on [0,1]^d (d\geq 1) satisfying dY(t)=n^{1/2}f(t)dt + dW(t), t \in [0,1]^d, where n \geq 1 is a given scale parameter (`sample size'), W is the standard Brownian sheet on [0,1]^d and f \in L_1([0,1]^d) is the unknown function of interest. We propose a multivariate multiscale statistic in this setting and prove its almost sure finiteness; this extends the work of D\"umbgen and Spokoiny (2001) who proposed the analogous statistic for d=1. We use the proposed multiscale statistic to construct optimal tests for testing f=0 versus (i) appropriate H\"{o}lder classes of functions, and (ii) alternatives of the form f=\mu_n \mathbb{I}_{B_n}, where B_n is an axis-aligned hyperrectangle in [0,1]^d and \mu_n \in \mathbb{R}; \mu_n and B_n unknown. In the process we generalize Theorem 6.1 of D\"umbgen and Spokoiny (2001) about stochastic processes with sub-Gaussian increments on a pseudometric space, which is of independent interest.
