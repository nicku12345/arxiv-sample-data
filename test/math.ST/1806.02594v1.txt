We describe a hierarchical Bayesian approach for inference about a parameter \theta lower-bounded by \alpha with uncertain \alpha, derive some basic identities for posterior analysis about (\theta,\alpha), and provide illustrations for normal and Poisson models. For the normal case with unknown mean \theta and known variance \sigma^2, we obtain Bayes estimators of \theta that take values on \mathbb{R}, but that are equally adapted to a lower-bound constraint in being minimax under squared error loss for the constrained problem.
