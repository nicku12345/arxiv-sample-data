The problem of estimating the regression function in a fixed design models with correlated observations is considered. Such observations are obtained from several experimental units, each of them forms a time series. Based on the trapezoidal rule, we propose a simple kernel estimator and we derive the asymptotic expression of its integrated mean squared error IMSE and its asymptotic normality. The problems of the optimal bandwidth and the optimal design with respect to the asymptotic IMSE are also investigated. Finally, a simulation study is conducted to study the performance of the new estimator and to compare it with the classical estimator of Gasser and M\"uller in a finite sample set. In addition, we study the robustness of the optimal design with respect to the misspecification of the autocovariance function.
