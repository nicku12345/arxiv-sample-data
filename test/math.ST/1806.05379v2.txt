Since the seminal work of Scarf (1958) [A min-max solution of an inventory problem, Studies in the Mathematical Theory of Inventory and Production, pages 201-209] on the newsvendor problem with ambiguity in the demand distribution, there has been a growing interest in the study of the distributionally robust newsvendor problem. The model is criticized at times for being overly conservative since the worst-case distribution is discrete with a few support points. However, it is the order quantity prescribed from the model that is of practical relevance. A simple calculation shows that the optimal order quantity in Scarf's model with known first and second moment is also optimal for a censored student-t distribution with parameter 2. In this paper, we generalize this "heavy-tail optimality" property of the distributionally robust newsvendor to an ambiguity set where information on the first and the \alphath moment is known, for any real number \alpha > 1. We show that the optimal order quantity for the distributionally robust newsvendor problem is also optimal for a regularly varying distribution with roughly a power law tail with tail index \alpha. We illustrate the usefulness of the model in the high service level regime with numerical experiments, by showing that when a standard distribution such as the exponential or lognormal distribution is contaminated with a heavy-tailed (regularly varying) distribution, the distributionally robust optimal order quantity outperforms the optimal order quantity of the original distribution, even with a small amount of contamination.
