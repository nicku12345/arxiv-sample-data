We consider the problem of empirical Bayes estimation of multiple variances \sigma_i^2's when providing with sample variances S_i's. Assuming an arbitrary prior and an invariant loss function, the resultant Bayes estimator relies on F(s^2), the marginal cumulative distribution function of the sample variances only. When replacing it by the empirical distribution function F_N(s^2), we obtain an F-modelling based Empirical Bayes estimator of Variances (F-EBV), which converges to the corresponding Bayes version uniformly over a large set. We then construct confidence intervals for mean parameters using different variance estimators. It is shown that the intervals based on the F-EBV is the shortest among all the intervals which guarantee a desired coverage probability. Through real data analysis, we have shown that intervals based on the F-EBV lead to the smallest number of discordances, a desirable property when dealing with the current "replication crisis".
