A new family of multivariate distributions, which shall be termed multivector variate distributions, based in the family of the multivariate contoured elliptically distribution is proposed. Several particular cases of multivector variate distributions are obtained and a number of published multivariate distributions in another contexts are found as simple corollaries. An application of interest in finance is full derived and compared with the traditional methods.
