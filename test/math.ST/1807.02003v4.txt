For a stationary moving average random field, a non-parametric low frequency estimator of the L\'evy density of its infinitely divisible independently scattered integrator measure is given. The plug-in estimate is based on the solution w of the linear integral equation v(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} g(s) w(h(s)x)ds, where g,h:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R} are given measurable functions and v is a (weighted) L^2-function on \mathbb{R}. We investigate conditions for the existence and uniqueness of this solution and give L^2-error bounds for the resulting estimates. An application to pure jump moving averages and a simulation study round off the paper.
