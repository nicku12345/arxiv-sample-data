Let X,U,Y be spherically symmetric distributed having density \eta^{d +k/2} \, f\left(\eta(\|x-\theta|^2+ \|u\|^2 + \|y-c\theta\|^2 ) \right)\,, with unknown parameters \theta \in \mathbb{R}^d and \eta>0, and with known density f and constant c >0. Based on observing X=x,U=u, we consider the problem of obtaining a predictive density \hat{q}(y;x,u) for Y as measured by the expected Kullback-Leibler loss. A benchmark procedure is the minimum risk equivariant density \hat{q}_{mre}, which is Generalized Bayes with respect to the prior \pi(\theta, \eta) = \eta^{-1}. For d \geq 3, we obtain improvements on \hat{q}_{mre}, and further show that the dominance holds simultaneously for all f subject to finite moments and finite risk conditions. We also obtain that the Bayes predictive density with respect to the harmonic prior \pi_h(\theta, \eta) =\eta^{-1} \|\theta\|^{2-d} dominates \hat{q}_{mre} simultaneously for all scale mixture of normals f.
