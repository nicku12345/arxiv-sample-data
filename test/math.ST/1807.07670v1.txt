There is a difficulty in finding an estimate of variance of the profile likelihood estimator in the joint model of longitudinal and survival data. We solve the difficulty by introducing the ``statistical generalized derivative''. The derivative is used to show the asymptotic normality of the estimator without assuming the second derivative of the density function in the model exists.
