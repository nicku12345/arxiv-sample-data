For \chi^2-tests with increasing number of cells, Cramer-von Mises tests, tests generated \mathbb{L}_2- norms of kernel estimators and tests generated quadratic forms of estimators of Fourier coefficients, we find necessary and sufficient conditions of consistency and inconsistency for sequences of alternatives having a given rate of convergence to hypothesis in \mathbb{L}_2-norm. We provide transparent interpretations of these conditions allowing to understand the structure of such consistent sequences. For problem of signal detection in Gaussian white noise we show that, if set of alternatives is bounded closed center-symmetric convex set U with deleted "small" \mathbb{L}_2 -- ball, then compactness of set U is necessary condition for existence of consistent tests.
