In a regression setting with response vector \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n and given regressor vectors \mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_p \in \mathbb{R}^n, a typical question is to what extent \mathbf{y} is related to these regressor vectors, specifically, how well can \mathbf{y} be approximated by a linear combination of them. Classical methods for this question are based on statistical models for the conditional distribution of \mathbf{y}, given the regressor vectors \mathbf{x}_j. Davies and Duembgen (2020) proposed a model-free approach in which all observation vectors \mathbf{y} and \mathbf{x}_j are viewed as fixed, and the quality of the least squares fit of \mathbf{y} is quantified by comparing it with the least squares fit resulting from p independent white noise regressor vectors. The purpose of the present note is to explain in a general context why the model-based and model-free approach yield the same p-values, although the interpretation of the latter is different under the two paradigms.
