The subject of this work is multiple group random coefficients regression models with several treatments and one control group. Such models are often used for studies with cluster randomized trials. We investigate A-, D- and E-optimal designs for estimation and prediction of fixed and random treatment effects, respectively, and illustrate the obtained results by numerical examples.
