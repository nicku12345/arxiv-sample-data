This paper introduces a new generalization of the power generalized Weibull distribution called the generalized power generalized Weibull distribution. This distribution can also be considered as a generalization of Weibull distribution. The hazard rate function of the new model has nice and flexible properties and it can take various shapes, including increasing, decreasing, upside-down bathtub and bathtub shapes. Some of the statistical properties of the new model, including quantile function, moment generating function, reliability function, hazard function and the reverse hazard function are obtained. The moments, incomplete moments, mean deviations and Bonferroni and Lorenz curves and the order statistics densities are also derived. The model parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The usefulness of the proposed model is illustrated by using two applications of real-life data.
