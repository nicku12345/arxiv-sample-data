In this paper, we describe a Bayesian nonparametric approach to make inference for a bivariate spherically symmetric distribution. We consider a Dirichlet invariant process prior on the set of all bivariate spherically symmetric distributions and we derive the Dirichlet invariant process posterior. Indeed, our approach is an extension of Dirichlet invariant process for the symmetric distributions on the real line to a bivariate spherically symmetric distribution where the underlying distribution is invariant under a finite group of rotations. Moreover, we obtain the Dirichlet invariant process posterior for the infinite transformation group and we prove that it approaches to Dirichlet process.
