In this paper for the first time the nonparametric autoregression estimation problem for the quadratic risks is considered. To this end we develop a new adaptive sequential model selection method based on the efficient sequential kernel estimators proposed by Arkoun and Pergamenshchikov (2016). Moreover, we develop a new analytical tool for general regression models to obtain the non asymptotic sharp or- acle inequalities for both usual quadratic and robust quadratic risks. Then, we show that the constructed sequential model selection proce- dure is optimal in the sense of oracle inequalities.
