Estimating the parameters from k independent Bin(n,p) random variables, when both parameters n and p are unknown, is relevant to a variety of applications. It is particularly difficult if n is large and p is small. Over the past decades, several articles have proposed Bayesian approaches to estimate n in this setting, but asymptotic results could only be established recently in \cite{Schneider}. There, posterior contraction for n is proven in the problematic parameter regime where n\rightarrow\infty and p\rightarrow0 at certain rates. In this article, we study numerically how far the theoretical upper bound on n can be relaxed in simulations without losing posterior consistency.
