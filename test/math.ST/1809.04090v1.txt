In this work we introduce a novel approach of construction of multivariate cumulative distribution functions, based on cyclical-monotone mapping of an original measure \mu \in \mathcal{P}^{ac}_2(\mathbb{R}^d) to some target measure \nu \in \mathcal{P}^{ac}_2(\mathbb{R}^d) , supported on a convex compact subset of \mathbb{R}^d. This map is referred to as \nu-Brenier distribution function (\nu-BDF), whose counterpart under the one-dimensional setting d = 1 is an ordinary CDF, with \nu selected as \mathcal{U}[0, 1], a uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Following one-dimensional frame-work, a multivariate analogue of Glivenko-Cantelli theorem is provided. A practical applicability of the theory is then illustrated by the development of a non-parametric pivotal two-sample test, that is rested on 2-Wasserstein distance.
