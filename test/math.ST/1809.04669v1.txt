Sparse linear discriminant analysis via penalized optimal scoring is a successful tool for classification in high-dimensional settings. While the variable selection consistency of sparse optimal scoring has been established, the corresponding prediction and estimation consistency results have been lacking. We bridge this gap by providing probabilistic bounds on out-of-sample prediction error and estimation error of multi-class penalized optimal scoring allowing for diverging number of classes.
