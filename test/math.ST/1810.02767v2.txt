We study a problem of estimation of smooth functionals of parameter \theta  of Gaussian shift model  X=\theta +\xi,\ \theta \in E,  where E is a separable Banach space and X is an observation of unknown vector \theta in Gaussian noise \xi with zero mean and known covariance operator \Sigma. In particular, we develop estimators T(X) of f(\theta) for functionals f:E\mapsto {\mathbb R} of H\"older smoothness s>0 such that  \sup_{\|\theta\|\leq 1} {\mathbb E}_{\theta}(T(X)-f(\theta))^2 \lesssim \Bigl(\|\Sigma\| \vee ({\mathbb E}\|\xi\|^2)^s\Bigr)\wedge 1,  where \|\Sigma\| is the operator norm of \Sigma, and show that this mean squared error rate is minimax optimal at least in the case of standard Gaussian shift model (E={\mathbb R}^d equipped with the canonical Euclidean norm, \xi =\sigma Z, Z\sim {\mathcal N}(0;I_d)). Moreover, we determine a sharp threshold on the smoothness s of functional f such that, for all s above the threshold, f(\theta) can be estimated efficiently with a mean squared error rate of the order \|\Sigma\| in a "small noise" setting (that is, when {\mathbb E}\|\xi\|^2 is small). The construction of efficient estimators is crucially based on a "bootstrap chain" method of bias reduction. The results could be applied to a variety of special high-dimensional and infinite-dimensional Gaussian models (for vector, matrix and functional data).
