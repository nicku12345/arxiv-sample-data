The hazard ratio is one of the most commonly reported measures of treatment effect in randomised trials, yet the source of much misinterpretation. This point was made clear by (Hernan, 2010) in commentary, which emphasised that the hazard ratio contrasts populations of treated and untreated individuals who survived a given period of time, populations that will typically fail to be comparable - even in a randomised trial - as a result of different pressures or intensities acting on both populations. The commentary has been very influential, but also a source of surprise and confusion. In this note, we aim to provide more insight into the subtle interpretation of hazard ratios and differences, by investigating in particular what can be learned about treatment effect from the hazard ratio becoming 1 after a certain period of time. Throughout, we will focus on the analysis of randomised experiments, but our results have immediate implications for the interpretation of hazard ratios in observational studies.
