In this paper we study approximations for boundary crossing probabilities for the moving sums of i.i.d. normal random variables. We propose approximating a discrete time problem with a continuous time problem allowing us to apply developed theory for stationary Gaussian processes and to consider a number of approximations (some well known and some not). We bring particular attention to the strong performance of a newly developed approximation that corrects the use of continuous time results in a discrete time setting. Results of extensive numerical comparisons are reported. These results show that the developed approximation is very accurate even for small window length.
