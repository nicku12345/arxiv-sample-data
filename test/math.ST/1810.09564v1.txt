It is well known that individual parameters of strongly correlated predictor variables in a linear model cannot be accurately estimated by the least squares regression due to multicollinearity generated by such variables. Surprisingly, an average of these parameters can be extremely accurately estimated. We find this average and briefly discuss its applications in the least squares regression.
