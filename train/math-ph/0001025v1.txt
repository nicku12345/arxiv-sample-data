If, in some problems, one has to deal with the ``product'' of distributions \rm f_i (also called generalized functions) \rm\bar T = \Pi^m_{i=1} f_i, this product has a priori no definite meaning as a functional (\rm \bar T, \phi)  for \rm\phi \in S. But if \rm x^{\kappa +1} \Pi^m_{i=1} f_i exists, whatever the associativity is between some powers \rm r_i of \rm x (\rm r_i \in \Bbb N, \sum_i r_i\leq \kappa +1, r_i \geq 0) and the various \rm f_i, then a continuation of the linear functional \rm \bar T from \rm M onto \rm S^{(N)} for some \rm N is shown to exist in such a way that \rm x^{\kappa +1} \bar T is defined unambiguously, and \rm (\bar T, \phi), \phi \in S, significant, though not unique.
