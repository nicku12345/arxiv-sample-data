We consider the dynamics generated by the Schroedinger operator H=-{1/2}\Delta + V(x) + W(\epsi x), where V is a lattice periodic potential and W an external potential which varies slowly on the scale set by the lattice spacing. We prove that in the limit \epsi \to 0 the time dependent position operator and, more generally, semiclassical observables converge strongly to a limit which is determined by the semiclassical dynamics.
