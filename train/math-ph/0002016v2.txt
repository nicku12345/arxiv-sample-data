Dzhumadil'daev has classified all tensor module extensions of diff(N), the diffeomorphism algebra in N dimensions, and its subalgebras of divergence free, Hamiltonian, and contact vector fields. I review his results using explicit tensor notation. All of his generic cocycles are limits of trivial cocycles, and many arise from the Mickelsson-Faddeev algebra for gl(N). Then his results are extended to some non-tensor modules, including the higher-dimensional Virasoro algebras found by Eswara Rao/Moody and myself. Extensions of current algebras with d-dimensional representations are obtained by restriction from diff(N+d). This gives a connection between higher-dimensional Virasoro and Kac-Moody cocycles, and between Mickelsson-Faddeev cocycles for diffeomorphism and current algebras.
