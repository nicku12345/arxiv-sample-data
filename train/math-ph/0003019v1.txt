In a first part, we generalize a theorem for an holomorphic \times  anti-holomorphic integrand, in the case of 2 dimensional Fourier transform. In the second part, we derive p-uple conformal integrals the integrand of which are linear combination of holomorphic times holomorphic generalized hypergeometric functions. The specific case p=3 is relevant to determine the triple Pomeron vertex in QCD.
