We present the construction of an exponentially accurate time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer approximation for molecular quantum mechanics. We study molecular systems whose electron masses are held fixed and whose nuclear masses are proportional to \epsilon^{-4}, where \epsilon is a small expansion parameter. By optimal truncation of an asymptotic expansion, we construct approximate solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation that agree with exact normalized solutions up to errors whose norms are bounded by \ds C \exp(-\gamma/\epsilon^2), for some C and \gamma>0.
