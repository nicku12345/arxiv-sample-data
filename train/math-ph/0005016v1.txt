By introducing the generalized master function of order up to four together with corresponding weight function, we have obtained all quasi-exactly solvable second order differential equations. It is shown that these differntial equations have solutions of polynomial type with factorziation properties, that is polynomial solutions Pm(E) can be factorized in terms of polynomial Pn(E) for m not equal to n. All known quasi-exactly quantum solvable models can be obtained from these differential equations, where roots of polynomial Pn(E) are corresponding eigen-values.
