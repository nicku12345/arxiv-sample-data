In this article we prove an upper bound for the Lyapunov exponent \gamma(E) and a two-sided bound for the integrated density of states N(E) at an arbitrary energy E>0 of random Schr\"odinger operators in one dimension. These Schr\"odinger operators are given by potentials of identical shape centered at every lattice site but with non-overlapping supports and with randomly varying coupling constants. Both types of bounds only involve scattering data for the single-site potential. They show in particular that both \gamma(E) and N(E)-\sqrt{E}/\pi decay at infinity at least like 1/\sqrt{E}. As an example we consider the random Kronig-Penney model.
