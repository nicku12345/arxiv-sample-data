It is proved that, in the Misra-Prigogine-Courbage Theory of Irreversibility using the Internal Time superoperator, fixing its associated non-unitary transformation \Lambda, amounts to rigging the corresponding Hilbert-Liouville space. More precisely, it is demonstrated that any \Lambda  determinates three canonical riggings of the Liouville space \QTR{cal}{L}: a first one with a Hilbert space with a norm greater than the relative one from \QTR{cal}{L}; a second one with a \sigma -Hilbertian space, which is a K\"{o}the space if \Lambda is compact and is a nuclear space if \Lambda has certain nuclear properties; and finally a third one with a smaller \sigma -Hilbertian space with a still stronger topology which is nuclear if \Lambda ^{n} is Hilbert-Schmidt, for some positive integer n. Viceversa: any rigging of this type, originated in a dynamical system having an Internal Time superoperator, defines a \Lambda in a canonical way.
