It is shown that Schroedinger equation is not consistent with information theory. From the modified form of information which ensures that the most probable density function it yields tallies with a general form of continuous Riemann integrable density function that has real or imaginary zeros or singularities at end points of [a,b] \epsilon R, a new variational formulation for quantum mechanics is proposed that yields a system of Euler-Lagrange equations that are non-linear. It is proved that the solutions of this system are unique, orthonormal and complete. One dimensional harmonic oscillator has been solved.
