The non self-adjointness of the radial momentum operator has been noted before by several authors, but the various proofs are incorrect. We give a rigorous proof that the n-dimensional radial momentum operator is not self- adjoint and has no self-adjoint extensions. The main idea of the proof is to show that this operator is unitarily equivalent to the momentum operator on L^{2}[(0,\infty),dr] which is not self-adjoint and has no self-adjoint extensions.
