Recently, several discussions on the possible observability of 4-vector potential have been published in literature. Furthermore, several authors recently claimed existence of the helicity=0 electromagnetic field. We re-examine the theory of antisymmetric tensor field and 4-vector potentials. We study the massless limits too. In fact, a theoretical motivation for this venture is old papers of Ogievetskii and Polubarinov, Hayashi, and Kalb and Ramond, which are widely accepted by physics community. This paper is based on two poster presentations "About the Longitudinal Nature of the Antisymmetric Tensor Field after Quantization" and "Normalization and m->0 Limit of the Proca Theory" at the Workshop "Lorentz Group, CPT and Neutrinos" (Zacatecas, Mexico, June 23-26, 1999).
