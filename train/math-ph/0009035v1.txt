We discuss the q deformation of Weyl-Heisenberg algebra in connection with the von Neumann theorem in Quantum Mechanics. We show that the q-deformation parameter labels the Weyl systems in Quantum Mechanics and the unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations in Quantum Field Theory.
