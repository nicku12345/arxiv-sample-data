We discovered that only a weakened version of the main lemma is true. We state the right version, and the remaining open problem: Is it possible to approximate holomorphic vector fields (or more generally, sections in a line bundle) on an open Riemann surface of finite type (i.e. a compact one without a finite number of points) by meromorphic vector fields (where the poles are supposed to be in the distinguished points) ? We know that this is true for functions.
