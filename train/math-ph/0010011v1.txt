The paper contains constructions of Hilbert systems for the action of the circle group T using subgroups of implementable Bogoljubov unitaries w.r.t. Fock representations of the Fermion algebra for suitable data of the selfdual framework: {\cal H} is the reference Hilbert space, \Gamma the conjugation and P a basis projection on {\cal H}. The group C({spec} {\cal Z}\to T) of T-valued functions on {spec} {\cal Z} turns out to be isomorphic to the stabilizer of {\cal A}. In particular, examples are presented where the center {\cal Z} of the fixed point algebra {\cal A} can be calculated explicitly.
