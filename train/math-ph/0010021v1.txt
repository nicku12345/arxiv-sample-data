Spherically symmetrical reductions of self-dual Yang-Mills and Einstein-Plebanski equations are constructed at the same manner. As in the first case we come back to known before solutions (under such kind of reduction but in some different form) if in the second one we obtain unknown before equation describing the spherically symmetrical configurations of Plebanski equation and some number of its particular solutions.
