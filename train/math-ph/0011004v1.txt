The Dirac method treatment for finite dimensional singular systems with weakly vanishing Hamiltonian leads to obtain the equations of motion in terms of parameter \tau. To obtain the correct equations of motion one should use gauge fixing of the form \tau - f(t)=0. It is shown that the canonical method leads to describe the evolution in both standard and constrained finite dimensional systems with weakly vanishing Hamiltonian in terms of the physical time t, without using any gauge fixing conditions. Besides the operator quantization of the these systems is investigated using the canonical method and it is shown that the evolution of the state \Psi with the time t is described by the Schr/"odinger equation i\frac{\partial \Psi}{\Partial t} = {\hat H}\Psi. The extension of this treatment to infinite dimensional systems is given.
