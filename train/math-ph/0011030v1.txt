The conservation laws for a class of nonlinear equations with variable coefficients on discrete and noncommutative spaces are derived. For discrete models the conserved charges are constructed explicitly. The applications of the general method include equations on quantum plane, supersymmetric equations for chiral and antichiral supermultiplets as well as auxiliary equations of integrable models - principal chiral model and various cases of nonlinear Toda lattice equations.
