A quaternionic partial differential equation is shown to be a generalisation of the Riccati ordinary differential equation and its relationship with the Schrodinger equation is established. Various approaches to the problem of finding particular solutions are explored, and the generalisations of two theorems of Euler on the Riccati differential equation, which correspond to the quaternionic equation, are given.
