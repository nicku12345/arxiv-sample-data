A Yang-Baxter relation-based formalism for generalized quantum affine algebras with the structure of an infinite Hopf family of (super-) algebras is proposed. The structure of the infinite Hopf family is given explicitly on the level of L matrices. The relation with the Drinfeld current realization is established in the case of 4\times4 R-matrices by studying the analogue of the Ding-Frenkel theorem. By use of the concept of algebra ``comorphisms'' (which generalize the notion of algebra comodules for standard Hopf algebras), a possible way of constructing infinitely many commuting operators out of the generalized RLL algebras is given. Finally some examples of the generalized RLL algebras are briefly discussed.
