A special asymptotic solution of the Painlev\'e-2 equation with small parameter is studied. This solution has a critical point t_* corresponding to a bifurcation phenomenon. When t<t_* the constructed solution varies slowly and when t>t_* the solution oscillates very fast. We investigate the transitional layer in detail and obtain a smooth asymptotic solution, using a sequence of scaling and matching procedures.
