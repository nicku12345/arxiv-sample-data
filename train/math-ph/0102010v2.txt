We study the reduction of non-autonomous regular Lagrangian systems by symmetries, which are generated by vector fields associated with connections in the configuration bundle of the system Q\times\real\to\real. These kind of symmetries generalize the idea of ``time-invariance'' (which corresponds to taking the trivial connection in the above trivial bundle).
