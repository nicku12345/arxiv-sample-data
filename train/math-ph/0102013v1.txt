This paper is an introduction to the von Neumann entropy in a historic approach. Von Neumann's gedanken experiment is repeated, which led him to the formula of thermodynamic entropy of a statistical operator. In the analysis of his ideas we stress the role of superselection sectors and summarize von Neumann's knowledge about quantum mechanical entropy. The final part of the paper is devoted to important developments discovered long after von Neumann's work. Subadditivity and the interpretation of the von Neumann entropy as channel capacity are among those.
