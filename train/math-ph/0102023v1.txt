Standart Coherent State Systems have an analysis based on lattices (von Neumann's lattices) in terms of wich they are classified, looking at the size of the minimun cell, by: complete, overcomplete and not complete. In this work we analize overcomplete systems with a geometrical viewpoint (holomorphic line-budles). We apply the method to evaluate the degeneracy of the lowest Landau level.
