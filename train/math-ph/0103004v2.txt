We discuss metastable states in the mean-field version of the strong coupling BCS-model and study the evolution of a superconducting equilibrium state subjected to a dynamical semi-group with Lindblad generator in detailed balance w.r.t. another equilibrium state. The intermediate states are explicitly constructed and their stability properties are derived. The notion of metastability in this genuine quantum system, is expressed by means of energy-entropy balance inequalities and canonical coordinates of observables.
