We consider initial-boundary-value problems for a class of nonlinear third order equations having non-autonomous forcing terms and get new asymptotic stability results by means of the Liapunov second method. The class includes equations arising in Superconductor Theory, Quantum Mechanics and in the Theory of Viscoelastic Materials.
