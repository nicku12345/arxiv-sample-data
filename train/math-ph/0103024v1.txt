We study two supersymmetric toy models of a k-form superfield, k=2,1 separately. By ``solving'' Jacobi identities, we show that each model is completely solvable at off-shell level, possesses a severely constrained kinematics, and gives a rigid representation of the supersymmetry algebra. This study of the toy models is motivated by our reanalysis on supersymmetry algebras in gauge theories where we discuss internal symmetry generators carrying spacetime/spinor indices.
