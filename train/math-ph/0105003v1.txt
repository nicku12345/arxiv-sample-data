We present a new family of the locus configurations which is not related to \vee-systems thus giving the answer to one of the questions raised in \cite{V1} about the relation between the generalised quantum Calogero-Moser systems and special solutions of the generalised WDVV equations. As a by-product we have new examples of the hyperbolic equations satisfying the Huygens' principle in the narrow Hadamard's sense. Another result is new multiparameter families of \vee-systems which gives new solutions of the generalised WDVV equation.
