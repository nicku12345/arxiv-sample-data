We present a new expansion of the zeta-function of Riemann. The current formalism -- which combines both the idea of interpolation with constraints and the concept of hypergeometric functions -- can, in a natural way, be generalised within the theory of the zeta-function of Hawking offering thus a variety of applications in quantum field theory, quantum cosmology and statistical mechanics.
