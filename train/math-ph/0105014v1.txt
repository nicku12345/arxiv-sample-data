The space of m-harmonic polynomials related to a Coxeter group G and a multiplicity function m on its root system is defined as the joint kernel of the properly gauged invariant integrals of the corresponding generalised quantum Calogero-Moser problem. The relation between this space and the ring of all quantum integrals of this system (which is isomorphic to the ring of corresponding quasiinvariants) is investigated.
