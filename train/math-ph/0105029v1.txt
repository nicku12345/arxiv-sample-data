A model is proposed for the classical electron as a point charge with finite electromagnetic self-energy. Modifications of the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m (spin 0) and Kerr-Newman (spin 1/2) solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations are derived. It is conjectured that spacetime curvature very close to the point charge deforms the electric and magnetic fields such as to reduce the self-energy to a finite value by means of Hawking polarization of the vacuum, much like that around a black hole.
