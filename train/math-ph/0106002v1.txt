The notion of a Lie conformal superalgebra encodes an axiomatic descrption of singular parts of the operator product expansions of chiral fields in conformal field theory. In the paper we give a detailed proof of the classification of all finite simple Lie conformal superalgebras. We also classify all their central extensions.
