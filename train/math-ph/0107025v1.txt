For finite Lie algebras, it is shown that characters can be defined first for Weyl orbits and then for irreducible representations. For A_N Lie algebras, weight multiplicities can then be calculated by only stating that characters are equivalent to Schur functions. This also means that to calculate characters there is no need to sum over Weyl groups. The compatibility with the Weyl character formula will however be shown.
