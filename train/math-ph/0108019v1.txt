An excitation dynamics of new quantum systems of N equidistant energy levels in a monochromatic field has been investigated. To obtain exact analytical solutions of dynamic equations an analytical method based on orthogonal functions of a real argument has been proposed. Using the orthogonal Legendre functions we have found an exact analytical expression for a population probability amplitude of the level n. Various initial conditions for the excitation of N-level quantum systems have been considered.
