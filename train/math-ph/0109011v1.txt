Addition theorems can be constructed by doing three-dimensional Taylor expansions according to f (\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}') = \exp (\mathbf{r}' \cdot \mathbf{\nabla}) f (\mathbf{r}). Since, however, one is normally interested in addition theorems of irreducible spherical tensors, the application of the translation operator in its Cartesian form \exp (x' \partial /\partial x) \exp (y' \partial /\partial y) \exp (z' \partial /\partial z) would lead to enormous technical problems. A better alternative consists in using a series expansion for the translation operator \exp (\mathbf{r}' \cdot \mathbf{\nabla}) involving powers of the Laplacian \mathbf{\nabla}^2 and spherical tensor gradient operators \mathcal{Y}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla), which are irreducible spherical tensors of ranks zero and \ell, respectively [F.D.\ Santos, Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 212}, 341 (1973)]. In this way, it is indeed possible to derive addition theorems by doing three-dimensional Taylor expansions [E.J. Weniger, Int. J. Quantum Chem. {\bf 76}, 280 (2000)]. The application of the translation operator in its spherical form is particularly simple in the case of B functions and leads to an addition theorem with a comparatively compact structure. Since other exponentially decaying functions like Slater-type functions, bound-state hydrogenic eigenfunctions, and other functions based on generalized Laguerre polynomials can be expressed by simple finite sums of B functions, the addition theorems for these functions can be written down immediately.
