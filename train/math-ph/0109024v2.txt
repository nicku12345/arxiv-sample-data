An algebraic description of basic physical fields (neutrino field, electron-positron field and electromagnetic field) is studied. It is sown that the electromagnetic field can be described within a quotient representation of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group. The relation of such a description with Majorana-Oppenheimer quantum electrodynamics and de Broglie-Jordan neutrino theory of light is discussed.
