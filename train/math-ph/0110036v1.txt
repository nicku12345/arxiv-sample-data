We parameterize the phase space density by time dependent diffeomorphic, Poisson preserving transformations on phase space acting on a reference density solution. We can look at these as transformations which fix time on the extended space of phase space and time. In this formulation the Vlasov equation is replaced by a constraint equation for the above maps. The new equations are formulated in terms of hamiltonian generators of one parameter families of diffeomorphic, Poisson preserving maps e.g. generators with respect to time or a perturbation parameter. We also show that it is possible to parameterize the space of solutions of the Vlasov equation by composition of maps subject to certain compatibility conditions on the generators. By using this composition principle we show how to formulate new equations for a hybrid fluid kinetic theory. This is done by observing that a certain subgroup of the group of phase space maps with generators which are linear in momentum correspond to the group of diffeomorphic maps parameterizing the continuity equation in fluid theory.
