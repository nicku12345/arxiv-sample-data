Hamilton equations based not only upon the Poincare--Cartan equivalent of a first-order Lagrangian, but rather upon its Lepagean equivalent are investigated. Lagrangians which are singular within the Hamilton--De Donder theory, but regularizable in this generalized sense are studied. Legendre transformation for regularizable Lagrangians is proposed, and Hamilton equations, equivalent with the Euler--Lagrange equations, are found. It is shown that all Lagrangians affine or quadratic in the first derivatives of the field variables are regularizable. The Dirac field and the electromagnetic field are discussed in detail.
