We study the enumeration of alternating links and tangles, considered up to topological (flype) equivalences. A weight n is given to each connected component, and in particular the limit n\to 0 yields information about (alternating) knots. Using a finite renormalization scheme for an associated matrix model, we first reduce the task to that of enumerating planar tetravalent diagrams with two types of vertices (self-intersections and tangencies), where now the subtle issue of topological equivalences has been eliminated. The number of such diagrams with p vertices scales as 12^p for p\to\infty. We next show how to efficiently enumerate these diagrams (in time \sim 2.7^p) by using a transfer matrix method. We give results for various generating functions up to 22 crossings. We then comment on their large-order asymptotic behavior.
