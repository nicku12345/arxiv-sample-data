We investigate the discrete spectrum of the Hamiltonian describing a quantum particle living in the two-dimensional straight strip. We impose the combined Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on different parts of the boundary. Several statements on the existence or the absence of the discrete spectrum are proven for two models with combined boundary conditions. Examples of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are computed numerically.
