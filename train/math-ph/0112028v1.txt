We classify the subalgebras of the general Lie conformal algebra \gc_N that act irreducibly on \C[\partial]^N and that are normalized by the \operatorname{sl}_2--part of a Virasoro element. The problem turns out to be closely related to classical Jacobi polynomials P_n^{(-\sigma,\sigma)}, \sigma\in\C. The connection goes both ways -- we use in our classification some classical properties of Jacobi polynomials, and we derive from the theory of conformal algebras some apparently new properties of Jacobi polynomials.
