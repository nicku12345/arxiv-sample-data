We consider discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators on the whole line and establish a criterion for continuity of spectral measures with respect to \log-Hausdorff measures. We apply this result to operators with Sturmian potentials and thereby prove logarithmic quantum dynamical lower bounds for all coupling constants and almost all rotation numbers, uniformly in the phase.
