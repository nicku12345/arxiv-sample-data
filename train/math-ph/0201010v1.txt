The multisymplectic structure of the KP equation is obtained directly from the variational principal. Using the covariant De Donder-Weyl Hamilton function theories, we reformulate the KP equation to the multisymplectic form which proposed by Bridges. From the multisymplectic equation, we can derive a multisymplectic numerical scheme of the KP equation which can be simplified to multisymplectic forty-five points scheme.
