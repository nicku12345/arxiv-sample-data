In this note we compute the functional derivative of the induced charge density, on a thin conductor, consisting of the union of g+1 disjoint intervals, J:=\cup_{j=1}^{g+1}(a_j,b_j), with respect to an external potential. In the context of random matrix theory this object gives the eigenvalue fluctuations of Hermitian random matrix ensembles where the eigenvalue density is supported on J.
