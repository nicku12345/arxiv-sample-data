Following ideas of Connes and Moscovici, we describe two spectral triples related to the Kronecker foliation, whose generalized Dirac operators are related to first and second order signature operators. We also consider the corresponding differential calculi \Omega_D, which are drastically different in the two cases. As a side-remark, we give a description of a known calculus on the two-dimensional noncommutative torus in terms of generators and relations.
