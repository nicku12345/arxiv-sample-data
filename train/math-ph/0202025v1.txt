We list defining relations for the four of the five exceptional simple Lie superalgebras some of which, as David Broadhurst conjectured and Kac demonstrated, may pertain to The Standard Model or Grand unified theories of elementary particles. For the fifth superalgebra the result is not final: there might be infinitely many relations. Contrariwise, for the same Lie superalgebra with Laurent polynomials as coefficients there are only finitely many relations.
