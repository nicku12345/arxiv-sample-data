As an extension of earlier work [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34 (2001) 11273] we obtain analytic expressions for the scattering phase shift of M-term relativistic separable potential with Laguerre-type form factors and for M = 1, 2, and 3. We take the Dirac Hamiltonian as the reference Hamiltonian. Just like in the cited article, the tools of the relativistic J-matrix method of scattering will be used. However, the results obtained here are for a general angular momentum, which is in contrast to the previous work where only S-wave scattering could be calculated. An exact numerical evaluation for higher order potentials (M >= 4) can be obtained in a simple and straightforward way.
