The formulation of a generalized classical electromagnetism that includes both electric and magnetic charges, is explored in the framework of two potential approach. It is shown that it is possible to write an action integral from which one can derive, by least action principle, the symmetrized set of Maxwell's equations, but also the Lorentz force law by employing the energy-momentum tensor conservation.
