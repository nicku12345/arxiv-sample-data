After having explained Samuel Clarke's conception of the new philosophy of physical reality, we will treat the electron field in this context as a field modifying the void. From this we will be able to derive the so-called quantum rules just from Noether's theorem on conserved currents. Thus quantum theory appears as a kind of nonlocal field theory, in fact a new theory.
