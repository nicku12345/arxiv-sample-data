Using the Pauli-Fierz model of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics, we calculate the binding energy of an electron in the field of a nucleus of charge Z and in presence of the quantized radiation field. We consider the case of small coupling constant \alpha, but fixed Z\alpha and ultraviolet cut-off \Lambda. We prove that after renormalizing the mass the binding energy has, to leading order in \alpha, a finite limit as \Lambda goes to infinity; i.e., the cut-off can be removed. The expression for the ground state energy shift thus obtained agrees with Bethe's formula for small values of Z\alpha, but shows a different behavior for bigger values.
