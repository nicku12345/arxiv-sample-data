We consider the Navier-Stokes system describing motions of viscous compressible heat-conducting and "self-gravitating" media. We use the state function of the form p(\eta,\theta)=p_0(\eta)+p_1(\eta)\theta linear with respect to the temperature \theta, but we admit rather general nonmonotone functions p_0 and p_1 of \eta, which allows us to treat various physical models of nuclear fluids (for which p and \eta are the pressure and specific volume) or thermoviscoelastic solids.   For an associated initial-boundary value problem with "fixed-free" boundary conditions and possibly large data, we prove a collection of estimates independent of time interval for solutions, including two-sided bounds for \eta, together with its asymptotic behaviour as t\to \infty. Namely, we establish the stabilization pointwise and in L^q for \eta, in L^2 for \theta, and in L^q for v (the velocity), for any q\in[2,\infty).
