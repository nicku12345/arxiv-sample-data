We give a general approach for the construction of deformed oscillators. These ones could be seen as describing deformed bosons. Basing on new definitions of certain quantum series, we demonstrate that they are nothing but the ordinary exponential functions in the limit when the deformation parameters goes to one. We also prove that these series converge to a complex function, in a given convergence radius that we calculate. Klauder's Coherent States are explicitly found through these functions that we design by deformed exponential functions
