The aim of this paper is to solve the bispectral problem for bispectral operators whose order is a prime number. More precisely we give a complete list of such bispectral operators. We use systematically the operator approach and in particular - Dixmier ideas on the first Weyl algebra. When the order is 2 the main theorem is exactly the result of Duistermaat-Gr\"unbaum . On the other hand our proofs seem to be simpler.
