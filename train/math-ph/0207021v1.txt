In the present paper geometric aspects of relationship between non-Noether symmetries and conservation laws in Hamiltonian systems is discussed. It is shown that integrals of motion associated with continuous non-Noether symmetry are in involution whenever generator of the symmetry satisfies certain Yang-Baxter equation.
