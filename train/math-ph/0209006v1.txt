The Perelomov coherent states of SU(1,1) are labeled by elements of the quotient of SU(1,1) by the compact subgroup. Taking advantage of the fact that this quotient is isomorphic to the affine group of the real line, we are able to parameterize the coherent states by elements of that group or equivalently by points in the half-plane. Such a formulation permits to find new properties of the SU(1,1) coherent states and to relate them to affine wavelets.
