Refined are the known descriptions of particle behavior with the help of Hamilton function in the phase space of coordinates and their multiple derivatives. This entails existing of circumstances when at closer distances gravitational effects can prove considerably more strong than in case of this situation being calculated with the help of Hamilton function in the phase space of coordinates and their first derivatives. For example, this may be the case if the gravitational potential is described as a power series in 1/r. At short distances the space metrics fluctuations may also be described by a divergent power series; henceforth, these fluctuations at smaller distances also constitute a power series, i.e. they are functions of 1/r. For such functions, the average of the coordinate equals zero if the frame of reference coincides with the point of origin.
