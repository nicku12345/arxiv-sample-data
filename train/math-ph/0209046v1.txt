We improve on the abstract estimate obtained in Part 1 by assuming that there are constraints imposed by `overlapping momentum loops'. These constraints are active in a two dimensional, weakly coupled fermion gas with a strictly convex Fermi curve. The improved estimate is used in another paper to control everything but the sum of all ladder contributions to the thermodynamic Green's functions.
