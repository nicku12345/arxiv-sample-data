In this paper we show that the homogeneity of the Pfaffian form representing the infinitesimal heat exchanged reversibly \delta Q_{rev} by a thermodynamic system allows to find immediately and explicitly an integrating factor. An interesting bridge between Carath\'eodory's approach to thermodynamics and Gibbs' approach is established.
