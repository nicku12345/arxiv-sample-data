We study the ultraviolet problem for quantum electrodynamics on a three dimensional torus. We start with the lattice gauge theory on a toroidal lattice and seek to control the singularities as the lattice spacing is taken to zero. This is done by following the flow of a sequence of renormalization group transformations. The analysis is facilitated by splitting the space of gauge fields into large and small fields at each step following Balaban. In this paper we explore the first step in detail.
