The ground state of a gas of Bosons confined in an external trap potential and interacting via repulsive two-body forces has recently been shown to exhibit complete Bose-Einstein condensation in the dilute limit, yielding for the first time a rigorous proof of this phenomenon in a physically realistic setting. We give here an account of this work about the Gross-Pitaevskii limit where the particle number N goes to infinity with Na fixed, where a is the scattering length of the interparticle interaction, measured in units of the trap size.
