We describe the `Lie algebra of classical mechanics', modelled on the Lie algebra generated by kinetic and potential energy of a simple mechanical system with respect to the canonical Poisson bracket. It is a polynomially graded Lie algebra, a class we introduce. We describe these Lie algebras, give an algorithm to calculate the dimensions c_n of the homogeneous subspaces of the Lie algebra of classical mechanics, and determine the value of its entropy \lim_{n\to\infty} c_n^{1/n}. It is 1.82542377420108..., a fundamental constant associated to classical mechanics.
