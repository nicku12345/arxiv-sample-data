One electron system minimally coupled to a quantized radiation field is considered. It is assumed that the quantized radiation field is {\it massless}, and {\it no} infrared cutoff is imposed. The Hamiltonian, H, of this system is defined as a self-adjoint operator acting on \LR\otimes\fff\cong L^2(\BR;\fff), where \fff is the Boson Fock space over L^2(\BR\times\{1,2\}). It is shown that the ground state, \gr, of H belongs to \cap_{k=1}^\infty D(1\otimes N^k), where N denotes the number operator of \fff. Moreover it is shown that, for almost every electron position variable x\in\BR and for arbitrary k\geq 0, \|(1\otimes \N)\gr (x) \|_\fff \leq D_ke^{-\delta |x|^{m+1}} with some constants m\geq 0, D_k>0, and \delta>0 independent of k. In particular \gr\in \cap_{k=1}^\infty D (e^{\beta |x|^{m+1}}\otimes N^k) for 0<\beta<\delta/2 is obtained.
