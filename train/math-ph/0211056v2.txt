Remarkably simple closed-form expressions for the elements of the groups SU(n), SL(n,R), and SL(n,C) with n=2, 3, and 4 are obtained using linear functions of biquaternions instead of n x n matrices. These representations do not directly generalize to SU(n>4). However, the quaternion methods used are sufficiently general to find applications in quantum chromodynamics and other problems which necessitate complicated 3 x 3 or 4 x 4 matrix calculations.
