The entanglement of formation as well as the conditional entropy can be used to define leaves in the state space, given by a linear superposition of their extremal points. Examples are presented, where these leaves can be specified and can be used to calculate the entanglement respectively the conditional entropy. The definition of entanglement is generalized to infinite systems and allows again to define a leaf structure. Finally we remark on the additivity property of both expressions, offering a counter example to the additivity of the conditional entropy.
