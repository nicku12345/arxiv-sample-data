Structure of the state-vector space for a system consisting of one mode parabose and one mode parafermi degree of freedom with the same parastatistics order p is studied and a complete, orthonormal set of basis vectors in this space is constructed. There is an intrinsic double degeneracy for state vectors with m parabosons and n parafermions, where m \not= 0, n \not= 0, and n \not= p. It is also shown that the degeneracy plays a key role in realization of exact supersymmetry for such a system.
