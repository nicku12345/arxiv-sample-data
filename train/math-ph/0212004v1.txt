In this paper the usual Z_2 graded Lie algebra is generalized to a new form, which may be called Z_{2,2} graded Lie algebra. It is shown that there exists close connections between the Z_{2,2} graded Lie algebra and parastatistics, so the Z_{2,2} can be used to study and analyse various symmetries and supersymmetries of the paraparticle systems.
