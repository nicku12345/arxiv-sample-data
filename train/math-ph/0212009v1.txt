A new kind of graded Lie algebra (we call it Z_{2,2} graded Lie algebra) is introduced as a framework for formulating parasupersymmetric theories. By choosing suitable bose subspace of the Z_{2,2} graded Lie algebra and using relevant generalized Jacobi identities, we generate the whole algebraic structure of parastatistics.
