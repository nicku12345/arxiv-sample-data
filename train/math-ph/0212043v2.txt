Let V be a n-dimensional real vector space. In this paper we introduce the concept of \emph{euclidean} Clifford algebra \mathcal{C\ell}(V,G_{E}) for a given euclidean structure on V, i.e., a pair (V,G_{E}) where G_{E} is a euclidean metric for V (also called an euclidean scalar product). Our construction of \mathcal{C\ell}(V,G_{E}) has been designed to produce a powerful computational tool. We start introducing the concept of \emph{multivectors} over V. These objects are elements of a linear space over the real field, denoted by \bigwedge V. We introduce moreover, the concepts of exterior and euclidean scalar product of multivectors. This permits the introduction of two \emph{contraction operators} on \bigwedge V, and the concept of euclidean \emph{interior} algebras. Equipped with these notions an euclidean Clifford product is easily introduced. We worked out with considerable details several important identities and useful formulas, to help the reader to develope a skill on the subject, preparing himself for the reading of the following papers in this series.
