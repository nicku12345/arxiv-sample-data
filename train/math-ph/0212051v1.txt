In this paper we report on a package, written in the Mathematica computer algebra system, which has been developed to compute the spheroidal wave functions of Meixner [J. Meixner and R.W. Schaefke, Mathieusche Funktionen und Sphaeroidfunktionen, 1954] and is available online (www.physics.uwa.edu.au/~falloon/spheroidal/spheroidal.html). This package represents a substantial contribution to the existing software, since it computes the spheroidal wave functions to arbitrary precision for general complex parameters mu, nu, gamma and argument z; existing software can only handle integer mu, nu and does not give arbitrary precision. The package also incorporates various special cases and computes analytic power series and asymptotic expansions in the parameter gamma. The spheroidal wave functions of Flammer [C. Flammer, Spheroidal Wave Functions, 1957] are included as a special case of Meixner's more general functions. This paper presents a concise review of the general theory of spheroidal wave functions and a description of the formulas and algorithms used in their computation, and gives high-precision numerical examples.
