We determine the leading low-energy fall-off of the integrated density of states of a magnetic Schroedinger operator with repulsive Poissonian random potential in case its single impurity potential has a slow anisotropic decay at infinity. This so-called magnetic Lifshits tail is shown to coincide with the one of the corresponding classical integrated density of states.
