Using a combination of the ladder operators of Pina [Rev. Mex. Fis. 41 (1995) 913] and the parametric operators of Mielnik [J. Math. Phys. 25 (1984) 3387] we introduce second order linear differential equations whose eigenfunctions are isospectral to the special functions of the mathematical physics and illustrate the method with several key examples
