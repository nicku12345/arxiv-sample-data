The present letter obtains the exact solution and geometric phase of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation governing the dipole oscillator in the exterior electric field, by making use of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation formulation. It is shown that the geometric phase presents the global property of the time evolution of the dipole oscillator in time-dependent environments.
