An integral-differential equation is derived for the self-consistent (effective) field in the medium consisting of many small bodies randomly distributed in some region. Acoustic and electromagnetic fields are considered in such a medium. Each body has a characteristic dimension a\ll\lambda, where \lambda is the wavelength in the free space.   The minimal distance d between any of the two bodies satisfies the condition d\gg a, but it may also satisfy the condition d\ll\lambda. Using Ramm's theory of wave scattering by small bodies of arbitrary shapes, the author derives an integral-differential equation for the self-consistent acoustic or electromagnetic fields in the above medium.
