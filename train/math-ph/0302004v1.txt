Genetic algorithms based on natural selection and minimal fluctuations have been applied to model physical and biological systems. Critical exponents have been extracted via computational simulations of nucleation for colossal magnetoresistance, heavy ions liquid-gas phase transitions and HIV to AIDS transition.
