We present an introduction to the mathematical theory of the Lagrangian formalism for multiform fields on Minkowski spacetime based on the multiform and extensor calculus. Our formulation gives a unified mathematical description for the main relativistic field theories including the gravitational field (which however will be discussed in a separate paper). We worked out several examples (including tricks of the trade), from simple to very sophisticated ones (like, e.g., the Dirac-Hestenes field on the more general gravitational background) which show the power and beauty of the formalism.
