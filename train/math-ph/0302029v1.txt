We establish quantum dynamical lower bounds for a number of discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators. These dynamical bounds are derived from power-law upper bounds on the norms of transfer matrices. We develop further the approach from part I and study many examples. Particular focus is put on models with finitely or at most countably many exceptional energies for which one can prove power-law bounds on transfer matrices. The models discussed in this paper include substitution models, Sturmian models, a hierarchical model, the prime model, and a class of moderately sparse potentials.
