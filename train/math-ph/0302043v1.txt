The invariance for the equation of fast diffusion in the 2D coordinate space has been proved, and its reduction to the 1D (with respect to the spatial variable) analog is demonstrated. On the basis of these results, new exact multi-dimensional solutions, which are dependent on arbitrary harmonic functions, are constructed. As a result, new exact solutions of the well-known Liouville equation - the steady-state analog for the fast diffusion equation with the linear source - have been obtained. Some generalizations for the systems of quasilinear parabolic equations, as well as systems of elliptic equations with Poisson interaction, which are applied in the theory of semiconductors, are considered.
