A polymer expansion is given for the Quantum Heisenberg Ferromagnet wave function. Working on a finite lattice, one is dealing entirely with algebraic identities; there is no question of convergence. The conjecture to be pursued in further work is that effects of large polymers are small. This is relevant to the question of the utility of the expansion and its possible extension to the infinite volume. In themselves the constructions of the present paper are neat and elegant and have surprising simplicity.
