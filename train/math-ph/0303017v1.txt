Some symmetries of time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations for inverse quadratic, linear, and quadratic potentials have been systematically examined by using a method suitable to the problem. Especially, the symmetry group for the case of the linear potential turns out to be a semi-direct product SL(2,R) x T_2(R) of the SL(2,R) with a two-dimensional real translation group T_2(R). Here, the time variable t transforms as t \to t^\prime = (ct+d)/(at+b) for real constants a, b, c, and d satisfying bc - ad =1 with an accompanying transformation for the space coordinate x.
