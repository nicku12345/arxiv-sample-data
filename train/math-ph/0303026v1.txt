The rings of quantum integrals of the generalized Calogero-Moser systems related to the deformed root systems {\cal A}_n(m) and {\cal C}_n(m,l) with integer multiplicities and corresponding algebras of quasi-invariants are investigated. In particular, it is shown that these algebras are finitely generated and free as the modules over certain polynomial subalgebras (Cohen-Macaulay property). The proof follows the scheme proposed by Etingof and Ginzburg in the Coxeter case. For two-dimensional systems the corresponding Poincare series and the deformed m-harmonic polynomials are explicitly computed.
