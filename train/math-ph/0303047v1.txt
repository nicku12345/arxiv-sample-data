We study the density of states measure for some class of random unitary band matrices and prove a Thouless formula relating it to the associated Lyapunov exponent. This class of random matrices appears in the study of the dynamical stability of certain quantum systems and can also be considered as a unitary version of the Anderson model. We further determine the support of the density of states measure and provide a condition ensuring it possesses an analytic density.
