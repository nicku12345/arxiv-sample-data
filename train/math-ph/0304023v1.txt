A unified canonical operator formalism for quantum stochastic differential equations, including the quantum stochastic Liouville equation and the quantum Langevin equation both of the It\^o and the Stratonovich types, is presented within the framework of Non-Equilibrium Thermo Field Dynamics (NETFD). It is performed by introducing an appropriate martingale operator in the Schr\"odinger and the Heisenberg representations with fermionic and bosonic Brownian motions. In order to decide the double tilde conjugation rule and the thermal state conditions for fermions, a generalization of the system consisting of a vector field and Faddeev-Popov ghosts to dissipative open situations is carried out within NETFD.
