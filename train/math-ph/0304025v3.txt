Given a finite order Lagrangian L on a fibre bundle, its global generalized symmetries depending on higher order derivatives of dynamic variables are considered. The first variational formula is obtained. It leads both to the corresponding Lagarngian conservation laws and the characteristic equation for generalized symmetries of L.
