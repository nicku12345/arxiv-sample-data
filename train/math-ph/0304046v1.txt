Preliminary results toward the analysis of the Hamiltonian structure of multifield theories describing complex materials are mustered: we involve the invariance under the action of a general Lie group of the balance of substructural interactions. Poisson brackets are also introduced in the material representation to account for general material substructures. A Hamilton-Jacobi equation suitable for multifield models is presented. Finally, a spatial version of all these topics is discussed without making use of the notion of paragon setting.
