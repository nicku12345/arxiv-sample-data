Scaling laws for characteristic length scales (in time or in the model parameters) are both experimentally robust and accessible for rigorous analysis. In multiscale situations cross--overs between different scaling laws are observed. We give a simple example from micromagnetics. In soft ferromagnetic films, the geometric character of a wall separating two magnetic domains depends on the film thickness. We identify this transition from a N\'eel wall to an Asymmetric Bloch wall by rigorously establishing a cross--over in the specific wall energy.
