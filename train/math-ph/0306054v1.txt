The time-domain response of highly conducting targets following a rapidly terminated electromagnetic pulse displays three distinct regimes: early, intermediate and late time. The intermediate and late times are characterized by a superposition of exponentially decaying eigenmodes. At early time an ever increasing number of rapidly decaying modes contribute, with the result that the scattered electric field displays a universal t^{-1/2} power law which emerges from the diffusive decay of a pattern of surface currents induced by the pulse. The power law amplitude reflects the surface geometry of the target, a property that may prove useful in buried target classification in geophysical remote sensing applications.
