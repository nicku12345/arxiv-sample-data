We investigate the two-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm operator H_{c_0,\beta} = {(-i\nabla -A)}^{2}-\beta\delta(.-\Gamma), where \Gamma is a smooth loop and A is the vector potential which corresponds to Aharonov-Bohm potential. The asymptotics of negative eigenvalues of H_{c_0,\beta} for \beta \longrightarrow +\infty is found. We also prove that for large enough positive value of \beta the system exhibits persistent currents.
