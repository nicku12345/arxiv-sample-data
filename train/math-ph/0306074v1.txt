The renewed interest in investigating quaternionic quantum mechanics, in particular tunneling effects, and the recent results on quaternionic differential operators motivate the study of resolution methods for quaternionic differential equations. In this paper, by using the real matrix representation of left/right acting quaternionic operators, we prove existence and uniqueness for quaternionic initial value problems, discuss the reduction of order for quaternionic homogeneous differential equations and extend to the non-commutative case the method of variation of parameters. We also show that the standard Wronskian cannot uniquely be extended to the quaternionic case. Nevertheless, the absolute value of the complex Wronskian admits a non-commutative extension for quaternionic functions of one real variable. Linear dependence and independence of solutions of homogeneous (right) H-linear differential equations is then related to this new functional. Our discussion is, for simplicity, presented for quaternionic second order differential equations. This involves no loss of generality. Definitions and results can be readily extended to the n-order case.
