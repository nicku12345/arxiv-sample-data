We consider a two level system, \mathcal{S}_{2}, coupled to a general n level system, \mathcal{S}_{n}, via a random matrix. We derive an integral representation for the mean reduced density matrix {\rho} (t) of \mathcal{S}_{2} in the limit n\to \infty , and we identify a model of \mathcal{S}_{n} which possesses some of the properties expected for macroscopic thermal reservoirs. In particular, it yields the Gibbs form for {\rho} (\infty). We consider also an analog of the van Hove limit and obtain a master equation (Markov dynamics) for the evolution of \rho (t) on an appropriate time scale.
