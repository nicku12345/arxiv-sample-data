Multidimensional contractions of irreducible representations of Cayley--Klein orthogonal algebras in Gel'fand--Zetlin basis are considered. Contracted over different parameters, algebras can turn out to be isomorphic. In this case method of transitions describes the same reducible representations in different basises, say discrete and continuons ones.
