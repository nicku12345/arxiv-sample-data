A class of vector coherent states is derived with multiple of matrices as vectors in a Hilbert space, where the Hilbert space is taken to be the tensor product of several other Hilbert spaces. As examples vector coherent states with multiple of quaternions and octonions are given. The resulting generalized oscillator algebra is briefly discussed. Further, vector coherent states for a tensored Hamiltonian system are obtained by the same method. As particular cases, coherent states are obtained for tensored Jaynes-Cummings type Hamiltonians and for a two-level two-mode generalization of the Jaynes-Cummings model.
