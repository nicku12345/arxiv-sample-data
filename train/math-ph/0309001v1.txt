A construction of differential constraints compatible with partial differential equations is considered. Certain linear determining equations with parameters are used to find such differential constraints. They generalize the classical determining equations used in the search for admissible Lie operators. As applications of this approach non-linear heat equations and Gibbons-Tsarev's equation are discussed. We introduce the notion of an invariant solution under an involutive distribution and give sufficient conditions for existence of such a solution.
