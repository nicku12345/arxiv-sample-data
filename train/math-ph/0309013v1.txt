We study internal structure of the Kemmer-Duffin-Petiau equations for spin-0 and spin-1 mesons. We demonstrate, that the Kemmer-Duffin-Petiau equations can be splitted into constituent equations, describing particles with definite mass and broken Lorentz symmetry. We also show that solutions of the three component constituent equations fulfill the Dirac equation.
