In recent years,constructive field techniques and the method of renormalization group around extended singularities have been applied to the weak coupling regime of the Anderson Model. It has allowed to clarify the relationship between this model and the theory of random matrices. We review this situation and the current program to analyze in detail the density of states and Green's functions of this model using the supersymmetric formalism.
