In nonrelativistic QED the charge of an electron equals its bare value, whereas the self-energy and the mass have to be renormalized. In our contribution we study perturbative mass renormalization, including second order in the fine structure constant \alpha, in the case of a single, spinless electron. As well known, if m denotes the bare mass and \mass the mass computed from the theory, to order \alpha one has \frac{\mass}{m} =1+\frac{8\alpha}{3\pi} \log(1+\half (\Lambda/m))+O(\alpha^2) which suggests that \mass/m=(\Lambda/m)^{8\alpha/3\pi} for small \alpha. If correct, in order \alpha^2 the leading term should be \displaystyle \half ((8\alpha/3\pi)\log(\Lambda/m))^2. To check this point we expand \mass/m to order \alpha^2. The result is \sqrt{\Lambda/m} as leading term, suggesting a more complicated dependence of m_{\mathrm{eff}} on m.
