Jets of modules over a commutative ring are well known to make up the representative objects of linear differential operators on these modules. In noncommutative geometry, jets of modules provide the representative objects only of a certain class of first order differential operators. As a consequence, a generalization of the standard Lagrangian formalism on smooth manifolds to noncommutative spaces is problematic.
