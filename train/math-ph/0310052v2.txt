In Continuum Light Cone Quantization (CLCQ) the treatment of scalar fields as operator valued distributions and properties of the accompanying test functions are recalled. Due to the paracompactness property of the Euclidean manifold these test functions appear as decomposition of unity. The approach is extended to QED   Dirac fields in a gauge invariant way. With such test functions the usual triangle anomalies are calculated in a simple and transparent way.
