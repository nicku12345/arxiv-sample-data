The Hamilton-Jacobi formalism for fermionic systems is studied. We derive the HJ equations from the canonical transformation procedure, taking into account the second class constraints typical of these systems. It is shown that these constraints ensure the consistency of the solution, according to the characteristics of fermionic systems. The explicit solutions for simple examples are computed. Some aspects related to canonical transformations and to quantization are discussed.
