In this paper, using concepts from the nonstandard physical world, the linear effect line element is derived. Previously this line element was employed to obtain, with the exception of radioactive decay, all of the experimentally verified special theory relativistic alterations in physical measures. In this paper by means of an operator equation and separation of variables, the relativistic alteration in decay time for radioactive material is obtained by applying a hypercontinuous microeffect that gives the appearance of a discrete alteration in the amount of radioactive material present.
