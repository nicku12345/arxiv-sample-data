In this paper, the Eddington-Finkelstein transformation is used as an illustration of how the problem of singularities or infinities can be removed by application of nonstandard analysis to the Schwarzschild line element (metric). The evolution of a gravitationally collapsing spherical body with radius greater than but near to the Schwarzschild radius is also investigated.
