We make some brief remarks on the relation of the mixmaster universe model of chaotic cosmology to the geometry of modular curves and to noncommutative geometry. In particular we consider a class of solutions with bounded number of cycles in each Kasner era and describe their dynamical properties, which we relate to the noncommutative geometry of a moduli space of such solutions, given by a Cuntz-Krieger C*-algebra.
