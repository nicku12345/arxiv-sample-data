It is proved that given a divergence operator on the structural sheaf of graded commutative algebras of a supermanifold, it is possible to construct a generating operator for the Krashil'shchik-Schouten bracket. This is a particular case of the construction of generating operators for a special class of bigraded Gerstenhaber algebras.   Also, some comments on the generalization of these results to the context of n-graded Jacobi algebras are included.
