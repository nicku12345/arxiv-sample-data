In a recent paper ([1],[2]) we have classified explicitely all the unitary highest weight representations of non compact real forms of semisimple Lie Algebras on Hermitian symmetric space. These results are necessary in order to construct all the unitary highest weight representations of affine Kac-Moody Algebras following some theorems proved by Jakobsen and Kac ([3],[4]).
