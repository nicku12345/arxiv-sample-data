We study the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system which describes large systems of particles interacting by means of their collectively generated forces. If the speed of light c is considered as a parameter then it is known that in the Newtonian limit c\to\infty the Vlasov-Poisson system is obtained. In this paper we determine the next order approximate system, which in the case of individual particles usually is called the Darwin approximation.
