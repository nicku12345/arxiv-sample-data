Starting from Rodrigues formula we present a general construction of raising and lowering operators for orthogonal polynomials of continuous and discrete variable on uniform lattice. In order to have these operators mutually adjoint we introduce orthonormal functions with respect to the scalar product of unit weight. Using the Infeld-Hull factorization method, we generate from the raising and lowering operators the second order self-adjoint differential/difference operator of hypergeometric type.
