In the 6th Int. Symposium on OPSFA there were several communications dealing with concrete applications of orthogonal polynomials to experimental and theoretical physics, chemistry, biology and statistics. Here I make suggestions concerning the use of powerful apparatus of orthogonal polynomials and special functions in several lines of research in mathematical physics
