Lanczos's idea of classical electrodynamics as a biquaternionic field theory in which point singularities are interpreted as electrons is reevaluated. Using covariant quaternionic integration techniques developed by Paul Weiss in 1941, we show that the Lagrangian suggested by Lanczos in his thesis of 1919 is equivalent to the standard Lagrangian of classical electrodynamics. On the mathematical side, Lanczos's thesis contains the correct generalizations of the Cauchy-Riemann regularity conditions, and of Cauchy's formula, from complex numbers to quaternions. Lanczos therefore anticipated Moisil-Fueter's discovery of 1931 by more than 12 years.
