We present a mathematical model for a physical theory that is compatible with Einstein's Special Relativity Theory. Our model consists of three pseudo-complex dimensions, representing three real dimensions of space, dual to what could be interpreted as three real dimensions of time. We use the term "pseudo-complex", since the mathematical object representing each paired space-time coordinate in our model, is a two-dimensional space over \mathbb{R} whose multiplication makes it into a non-commutative non-associative algebra. We have been unable to find records of this very elementary mathematical object in the literature.
