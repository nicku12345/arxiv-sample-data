The ground states of an abstract model in quantum field theory are investigated. By means of the asymptotic field theory, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for that the expectation value of the number operator of ground states is finite, from which we obtain a wide-usable method to estimate an upper bound of the multiplicity of ground states. Ground states of massless GSB models and the Pauli-Fierz model with spin 1/2 are investigated as examples.
