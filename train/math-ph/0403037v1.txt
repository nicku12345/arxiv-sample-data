Let V_\Gamma be a lattice periodic potential and A and \phi external electromagnetic potentials which vary slowly on the scale set by the lattice spacing. It is shown that the Wigner function of a solution of the Schroedinger equation with Hamiltonian operator H = {1/2} (-\I\nabla_x - A(\epsilon x))^2 + V_\Gamma (x) + \phi(\epsilon x) propagates along the flow of the semiclassical model of solid states physics up an error of order \epsilon. If \epsilon-dependent corrections to the flow are taken into account, the error is improved to order \epsilon^2. We also discuss the propagation of the Wigner measure. The results are obtained as corollaries of an Egorov type theorem proved in a previous paper (math-ph/0212041).
