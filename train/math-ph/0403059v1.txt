A q-generalization of the product densities in stochastic point processes is developed. The properties of these functions are studied and a q-generalization of the usual C^r_s coefficients is obtained. This for fixed q-number of particles coincides with the q-Stirling numbers of the second kind. The q-product densities are investigated using q-Poisson distribution and this shows that the stochastic point processes involving consistent q-generalization are inherently correlated. A closely related function to q-product densities is a q-generalized Janossy function and a relation between the two is established.
