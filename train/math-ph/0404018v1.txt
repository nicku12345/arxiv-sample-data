We consider high temperature KMS states for quantum spin systems on a lattice. We prove a large deviation principle for the distribution of empirical averages \frac{1}{|\Lambda|} \sum_{i\in\Lambda} X_i, where the X_i's are copies of a self-adjoint element X (level one large deviations). From the analyticity of the generating function, we obtain the central limit theorem. We generalize to a level two large deviation principle for the distribution of \frac{1}{|\Lambda|}\sum_{i\in\Lambda} \delta_{X_i}.
