We prove Wigner-Eckart theorem for the irreducible tensor operators for arbitrary Hopf algebras, provided that tensor product of their irreducible representation is completely reducible. The proof is based on the properties of the irreducible representations of Hopf algebras, in particular on Schur lemma. Two classes of tensor operators for the Hopf algebra U_{t}(su(2)) are considered. The reduced matrix elements for the class of irreducible tensor operators are calculated. A construction of some elements of the center of U_{t}(su(2)) is given.
