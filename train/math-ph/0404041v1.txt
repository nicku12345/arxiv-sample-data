A hierarchical model of interacting quantum particles performing anharmonic oscillations is studied in the Euclidean approach, in which the local Gibbs states are constructed as measures on infinite dimensional spaces. The local states restricted to the subalgebra generated by fluctuations of displacements of particles are in the center of the study. They are described by means of the corresponding temperature Green (Matsubara) functions. The result of the paper is a theorem, which describes the critical point convergence of such Matsubara functions in the thermodynamic limit.
