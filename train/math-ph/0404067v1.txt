A method of Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for relativistic spin-1/2 particles in external fields is proposed. It permits determination of the Hamilton operator in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation with any accuracy. Interactions between a particle having an anomalous magnetic moment and nonstationary electromagnetic and electroweak fields are investigated.
