A set of N three component unit scalar fields in (3+1) Minkowski space-time is investigated. The highly nonlinear coupling between them is chosen to omit the scaling instabilities. The multi-soliton static configurations with arbitrary Hopf numbers are found. Moreover, the generalized version of the Vakulenko-Kapitansky inequality is obtained. The possibility of attractive, repulsing and noninteracting channels is discussed.
