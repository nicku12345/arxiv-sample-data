In the present paper, we study a linear thermoelastic porous material with a constitutive equation for heat flux with memory. An approximated theory of thermodynamics is presented for this model and a maximal pseudo free energy is determined. We use this energy to study the spatial behaviour of the thermodynamic processes in porous materials. We obtain the domain of influence theorem and establish the spatial decay estimates inside of the domain of influence. Further, we prove a uniqueness theorem valid for finite or infinite body. The body is free of any kind of a priori assumptions concerning the behaviour of solutions at infinity.
