The tunneling hamiltonian has proven to be a useful method in many body physics to treat particle tunneling between different states represented as wavefunctions. Our problem is here applying what we did in the first paper to a driven sine-Gordon system. Here we apply a generalization of the tunneling Hamiltonian to charge density wave transport problems, in which tunneling between states which are wavefunctionals of a scalar quantum field are considered. We derive I-E curves which match Zenier curves used to fit data experimentally with wavefunctionals congruent with the false vacuum hypothesis
