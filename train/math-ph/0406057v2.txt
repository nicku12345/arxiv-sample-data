We present a unified group-theoretical derivation of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) on the circle \mathbb S^1 and the real line \mathbb{R}, following the general formalism of Coherent States (CS) associated to unitary square integrable (modulo a subgroup, possibly) representations of the group SL(2,\mathbb{R}). A general procedure for obtaining unitary representations of a group G of affine transformations on a space of signals L^2(X,dx) is described, relating carrier spaces X to (first or higher-order) ``polarization subalgebras'' {\cal P}_X. We also provide explicit admissibility and continuous frame conditions for wavelets on \mathbb S^1 and discuss the Euclidean limit in terms of group contraction.
