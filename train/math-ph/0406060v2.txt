P-, T-, C-transformations of the Dirac field in the de Sitter space are studied in the framework of an automorphism set of Clifford algebras. Finite group structure of the discrete transformations is elucidated. It is shown that CPT groups of the Dirac field in Minkowski and de Sitter spaces are isomorphic.
