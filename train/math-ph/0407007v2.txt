We study the statistical monotonicity of the scalar curvature for the alpha-geometries on the simplex of probability vectors. From the results obtained and from numerical data we are led to some conjectures about quantum alpha-geometries and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson information. Finally we show that this last conjecture implies the truth of the Petz conjecture about the monotonicity of the scalar curvature of the Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori monotone metric.
