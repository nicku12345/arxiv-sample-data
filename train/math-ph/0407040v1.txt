We show that the Witten covariant phase space for p-branes with thickness in an arbitrary background is endowed of a symplectic potential, which although is not important to the dynamics of the system, plays a relevant role on the phase space, allowing us to generate a symplectic structure for the theory and therefore give a covariant description of canonical formalism for quantization.
