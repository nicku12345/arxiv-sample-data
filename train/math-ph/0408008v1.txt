We establish a link between the multisymplectic and the covariant phase space approach to geometric field theory by showing how to derive the symplectic form on the latter, as introduced by Crnkovic-Witten and Zuckerman, from the multisymplectic form. The main result is that the Poisson bracket associated with this symplectic structure, according to the standard rules, is precisely the covariant bracket due to Peierls and DeWitt.
