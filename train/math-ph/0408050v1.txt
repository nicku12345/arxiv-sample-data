We prove that for a Wightman quantum field \phi(x) the assumptions (i) positivity of the metric on the state space {\cal H} of the theory (ii) the asymptotic condition in the form of Yang-Feldman equations and (iii) Klein-Gordon equation for the outgoing field imply that the states generated by application of the asymptotic fields to the vacuum are stable. We prove by a counter example that this statement is wrong in the case of quantum fields with indefinite metric.
