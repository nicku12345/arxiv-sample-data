In this paper we study the large-Z behaviour of the ground state energy of atoms with electrons having relativistic kinetic energy sqrt(p^2c^2+m^2c^4)-mc^2. We prove that to leading order in Z the energy is the same as in the non-relativistic case, given by (non-relativistic) Thomas-Fermi theory. For the problem to make sense, we keep the product Z*alpha fixed (here alpha is Sommerfeld's fine structure constant), and smaller than, or equal to, 2/pi, which means that as Z tends to infinity, alpha tends to zero.
