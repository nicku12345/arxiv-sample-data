Spontaneous edge currents are known to occur in systems of two space dimensions in a strong magnetic field. The latter creates chirality and determines the direction of the currents. Here we show that an analogous effect occurs in a field-free situation when time reversal symmetry is broken by the mass term of the Dirac equation in two space dimensions. On a half plane, one sees explicitly that the strength of the edge current is proportional to the difference between the chemical potentials at the edge and in the bulk, so that the effect is analogous to the Hall effect, but with an internal potential. The edge conductivity differs from the bulk (Hall) conductivity on the whole plane. This results from the dependence of the edge conductivity on the choice of a selfadjoint extension of the Dirac Hamiltonian. The invariance of the edge conductivity with respect to small perturbations is studied in this example by topological techniques.
