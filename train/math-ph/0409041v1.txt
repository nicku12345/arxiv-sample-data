We present a classification of the hyperbolic Kac-Moody (HKM) superalgebras. The HKM superalgebras of rank larger or equal than 3 are finite in number (213) and limited in rank (6). The Dynkin-Kac diagrams and the corresponding simple root systems are determined. We also discuss a class of singular sub(super)algebras obtained by a folding procedure.
