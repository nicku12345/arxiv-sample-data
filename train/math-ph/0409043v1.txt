Schr\" odinger-Robertson uncertainty relation is minimized for the quadrature components of Weyl generators of the algebra su(N). This is done by determining explicit Fock-Bargamann representation of the su(N) coherent states and the differential realizations of the elements of su(N).   New classes of coherent and squeezed states are explicitly derived.
