Robertson intelligent states which minimize the Schr\" odinger-Robertson uncertainty relation are constructed as eigenstates of a linear combination of Weyl generators of the su(3) algebra. The construction is based on the analytic representations of su(3) coherent states. New classes of coherent and squeezed states are explicitly derived.
