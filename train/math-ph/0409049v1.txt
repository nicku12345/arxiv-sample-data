Some difficulties are pointed out in the methods for identification of obstacles based on the numerical verification of the inclusion of a function in the range of an operator. Numerical examples are given to illustrate theoretical conclusions. Alternative methods of identification of obstacles are mentioned: the Support Function Method (SFM) and the Modified Rayleigh Conjecture (MRC) method.
