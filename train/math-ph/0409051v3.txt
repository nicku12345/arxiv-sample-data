The Dirac monopoles in 3-space and their generalization by C. N. Yang to 5-space are observed to be just the Levi-Civita spin connection of the cylindrical Riemannian metric on the 3- and 5- dimensional punctured spaces. Their straightforward generalization to higher dimensions is also investigated.
