We present in this paper a realistic construction of the coherent states for the Morse potential using the Klauder-Perelomov approach . We discuss the statistical properties of these states, by deducing the Q- and P-distribution functions. The thermal expectations for the quantum canonical ideal gas of the Morse oscillators are also calculated.
