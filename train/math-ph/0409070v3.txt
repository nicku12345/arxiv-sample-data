The paper investigates relations between the phase space structure of a quantum field theory ("nuclearity") and the concept of pointlike localized fields. Given a net of local observable algebras, a phase space condition is introduced that allows a very detailed description of the theory's field content. An appendix discusses noninteracting models as examples.
