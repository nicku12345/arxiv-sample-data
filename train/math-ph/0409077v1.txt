Octonions are introduced through some spin representations. The groups G_2, F_4 and the E series appear in a natural manner; one way to understand octonions is as the "second coming" of the reals, but with the spinors instead of vectors. Some physical applications in M- and F-theory as putative "theories of everything" are suggested.
