A method is developed to determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunction of two-boson 2\times 2 matrix Hamiltonians include a wide class of quantum optical models. The quantum Hamiltonians have been transformed in the form of the one variable differential equation and the conditions for its solvability have been discussed. We present two different transformation procedure and we show our approach unify various approaches based on Lie algebraic technique. As an application, solutions of the modified Jaynes-Cummings and two-level Jahn Teller Hamiltonians are studied.
