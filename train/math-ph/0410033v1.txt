This is a didactic review of spectral and dynamical properties of atoms and molecules at energies below the ionization threshold, the focus being on recent work in which the author was involved. As far as possible, the results are described using a simple model with \emph{one} electron only, and with \emph{scalar} bosons. The main ideas are explained but no complete proofs are given. The full-fledged standard model of non-relativistic QED and various of its aspects are described in the appendix.
