We study the Nordstr\"om-Vlasov system which describes the dynamics of a self-gravitating ensemble of collisionless particles in the framework of the Nordstr\"om scalar theory of gravitation. If the speed of light c is considered as a parameter, it is known that in the Newtonian limit c\to\infty the Vlasov-Poisson system is obtained. In this paper we determine a higher approximation and establish a pointwise error estimate of order O(c^{-4}). Such an approximation is usually called a 1.5 post-Newtonian approximation.
