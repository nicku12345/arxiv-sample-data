A hypergeometric type equation satisfying certain conditions defines either a finite or an infinite system of orthogonal polynomials. We present in a unified and explicit way all these systems of orthogonal polynomials, the associated special functions and the corresponding raising/lowering operators. This general formalism allows us to extend some known results to a larger class of functions.
