We investigate the asymptotics of the determinant of N by N Hankel matrices generated by Fisher-Hartwig symbols defined on the real line, as N becomes large. Such objects are natural analogues of Toeplitz determinants generated by Fisher-Hartwig symbols, and arise in random matrix theory in the investigation of certain expectations involving random characteristic polynomials. The reduced density matrices of certain one-dimensional systems of impenetrable bosons can also be expressed in terms of Hankel determinants of this form.   We focus on the specific cases of scaled Hermite and Laguerre weights. We compute the asymptotics using a duality formula expressing the N by N Hankel determinant as a 2|q|-fold integral, where q is a fixed vector, which is valid when each component of q is natural.We thus verify, for such q, a recent conjecture of Forrester and Frankel derived using a log-gas argument.
