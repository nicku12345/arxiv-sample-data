The tunneling Hamiltonian is a proven method to treat particle tunneling between different states represented as wavefunctions in many-body physics. Our problem is how to apply a wave functional formulation of tunneling Hamiltonians to a driven sine-Gordon system. We apply a generalization of the tunneling Hamiltonian to charge density wave (CDW) transport problems in which we consider tunneling between states that are wavefunctionals of a scalar quantum field. We present derived I-E curves that match Zenier curves used to fit data experimentally with wavefunctionals congruent with the false vacuum hypothesis. THe open question is whether the coefficients picked in both the wavefunctionals and the magnitude of the coefficents of the driven sine Gordon physical system should be picked by topological charge arguements that in principle appear to assign values that have a tie in with the false vacuum hypothesis first presented by Sidney Coleman
