The classical divergence theorem for an n-dimensional domain A and a smooth vector field F in n-space \int_{\partial A} F \cdot n = \int_A div F requires that a normal vector field n(p) be defined a.e. p \in \partial A. In this paper we give a new proof and extension of this theorem by replacing n with a limit \star \partial A of 1-dimensional polyhedral chains taken with respect to a norm. The operator \star is a geometric dual to the Hodge star operator and is defined on a large class of k-dimensional domains of integration A in n-space the author calls {\em chainlets}. Chainlets include a broad range of domains, from smooth manifolds to soap bubbles and fractals. We prove as our main result the Star theorem \int_{\star A} \omega = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\int_A \star \omega.   When combined with the general Stokes' theorem for chainlet domains \int_{\partial A} \omega = \int_A d \omega this result yields optimal and concise forms of Gauss' divergence theorem \int_{\star \partial A}\omega = (-1)^{(k-1)(n-k+1)} \int_A d\star \omega and Green's curl theorem \int_{\partial A} \omega = \int_{\star A} \star d\omega.
