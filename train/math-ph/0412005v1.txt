An implicit solution to the vanishing of the so-called Universal Field Equation, or Bordered Hessian, which dates at least as far back as 1935 \cite{chaundy} is revived, and derived from a much later form of the solution. A linear ansatz for an implicit solution of second order partial differential equations, previously shown to have wide applicability \cite{fai} is at the heart of the Chaundy solution, and is shown to yield solutions even to the linear wave equation.
