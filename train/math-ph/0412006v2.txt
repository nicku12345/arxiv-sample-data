We examine quantum decay of the false vacuum in the driven sine-Gordon system and show how both together permit construction of a Gaussian wave functional. This is due to changing a least action integral to be similar with respect to the WKB approximation. In addition we find that the soliton - anti soliton (S-S') separation distance obtained from the Bogomol'nyi inequality permits after rescaling a dominant quadratic field contribution to the least action integrand. This is from an initial scalar potential characterized by a tilted double well potential construction.
