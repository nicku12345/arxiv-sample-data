We call attention to the unusual properties that the 4 dimensional solutions for a modified Fueter-Dirac equations satisfy: In a coordinate-free, constant-free and strictly mathematical way it is possible to show that all the solutions for a modified Fueter-Dirac Equation, which are radial symmetric when restricted to the 3-space, have a nice algebraic structure. Locally, these solutions behave naturally in a algebraic way determined by a certain commutative ring related to the quaternions with non-invertibles. This ring has a nontrivial localization. By using left and right versions of the operator we obtain quirality.
