These lectures provide an informal introduction into the notions and tools used to analyze statistical properties of eigenvalues of large random Hermitian matrices. After developing the general machinery of orthogonal polynomial method, we study in most detail Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) as a paradigmatic example. In particular, we discuss Plancherel-Rotach asymptotics of Hermite polynomials in various regimes and employ it in spectral analysis of the GUE. In the last part of the course we discuss general relations between orthogonal polynomials and characteristic polynomials of random matrices which is an active area of current research.
