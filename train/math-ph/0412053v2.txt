We have shown that a scalar field can be used, employing Scherrer's k essence cosmological sound calculation, to model how we evolve from a dark matter- dark energy mix to a cosmological constant. Here, we are exploring what initiates the decay of the near perfect thin wall approximation on that scalar field to circumstances permitting a k essence speed-of-sound argument in favor of traditional models of Einstein's cosmological constant as a driving force for inflationary expansion.
