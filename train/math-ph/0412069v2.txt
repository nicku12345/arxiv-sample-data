We consider a nonrelativistic electron interacting with a classical magnetic field pointing along the x_{3}-axis and with a quantized electromagnetic field. When the interaction between the electron and photons is turned off, the electronic system is assumed to have a ground state of finite multiplicity. Because of the translation invariance along the x_{3}-axis, we consider the reduced Hamiltonian associated with the total momentum along the x_{3}-axis and, after introducing an ultraviolet cutoff and an infrared regularization, we prove that the reduced Hamiltonian has a ground state if the coupling constant and the total momentum along the x_{3}-axis are sufficiently small. Finally we determine the absolutely continuous spectrum of the reduced Hamiltonian.
