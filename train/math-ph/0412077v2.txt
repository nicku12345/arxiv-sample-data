Using a strongly covariant formalism given by Carter for the deformations dynamics of p-branes in a curved background and a covariant and gauge invariant geometric structure constructed on the corresponding Witten's phase space, we identify the canonical variables for Dirac-Nambu-Goto [DNG] and Gauss-Bonnet [GB] system in string theory. Future extensions of the present results are outlined.
