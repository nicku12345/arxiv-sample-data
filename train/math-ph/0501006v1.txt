We present a formalism for inferring the equation of evolution of a complex wave field that is known to obey an otherwise unspecified (2+1)-dimensional time-dependent complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, given field moduli over three closely-spaced planes. The phase of the complex wave field is retrieved via a non-interferometric method, and all terms in the equation of evolution are determined using only the magnitude of the complex wave field. The formalism is tested using simulated data for a generalized nonlinear system with a single-component complex wave field. The method can be generalized to multi-component complex fields.
