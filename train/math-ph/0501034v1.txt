We study quantum field models in indefinite metric. We introduce the modified Wightman axioms of Morchio and Strocchi as a general framework of indefinite metric quantum field theory (QFT) and present concrete interacting relativistic models obtained by analytical continuation from some stochastic processes with Euclidean invariance. As a first step towards scattering theory in indefinite metric QFT, we give a proof of the spectral condition on the translation group for the relativistic models.
