We describe some results concerning the phase space of 3-dimensional Einstein gravity when space is a torus and with negative cosmological constant. The approach uses the holonomy matrices of flat SL(2,R) connections on the torus to parametrise the geometry. After quantization, these matrices acquire non-commuting entries, in such a way that they satisfy q-commutation relations and exhibit interesting geometrical properties. In particular they lead to a quantization of the Goldman bracket.
