We give a brief review of quantum energy inequalities (QEIs) and then discuss two lines of work which suggest that QEIs are closely related to various natural properties of quantum field theory which may all be regarded as stability conditions. The first is based on joint work with Verch, and draws connections between microscopic stability (microlocal spectrum condition), mesoscopic stability (QEIs) and macroscopic stability (passivity). The second direction considers QEIs for a countable number of massive scalar fields, and links the existence and scaling properties of QEIs to the spectrum of masses. The upshot is that the existence of a suitable QEI with polynomial scaling is a sufficient condition for the model to satisfy the Buchholz--Wichmann nuclearity criterion. We briefly discuss on-going work with Ojima and Porrmann which seeks to gain a deeper understanding of this relationship.
