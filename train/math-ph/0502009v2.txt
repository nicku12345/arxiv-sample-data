This paper presents an underlying analytical relationship between the \mathcal{PT}-pseudo-norm associated with the \mathcal{PT}-symmetric Hamiltonian H = p^2+ V(q) and the Stokes multiplier of the differential equation corresponding to this Hamiltonian. We show that the sign alternation of \mathcal{PT}-pseudo-norm, which has been observed as a generic feature of the \mathcal{PT}-inner product, is essentially controlled by the derivative of Stokes multiplier with respect to eigenparameter.
