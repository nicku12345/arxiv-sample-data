According to the classification scheme of the generalized random matrix ensembles, we present various kinds of concrete examples of the generalized ensemble, and derive their joint density functions in an unified way by one simple formula which was proved in [2]. Particular cases of these examples include Gaussian ensemble, chiral ensemble, new transfer matrix ensembles, circular ensemble, Jacobi ensembles, and so on. The associated integration formulae are also given, which are just many classical integration formulae or their variation forms.
