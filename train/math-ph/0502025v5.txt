We consider random Schr\"odinger equations on \bZ^d for d\ge 3 with identically distributed random potential. Denote by \lambda the coupling constant and \psi_t the solution with initial data \psi_0. The space and time variables scale as x\sim \lambda^{-2 -\kappa/2}, t \sim \lambda^{-2 -\kappa} with 0< \kappa < \kappa_0(d). We prove that, in the limit \lambda \to 0, the expectation of the Wigner distribution of \psi_t converges weakly to a solution of a heat equation in the space variable x for arbitrary L^2 initial data. The diffusion coefficient is uniquely determined by the kinetic energy associated to the momentum v.   This work is an extension to the lattice case of our previous result in the continuum \cite{ESYI}, \cite{ESYII}. Due to the non-convexity of the level surfaces of the dispersion relation, the estimates of several Feynman graphs are more involved.
