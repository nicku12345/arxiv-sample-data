We consider a hierarchy of classical Liouville completely integrable models sharing the same (linear) r--matrix structure obtained through an N--th jet--extension of \mathfrak{su}(2) rational Gaudin models. The main goal of the present paper is the study of the integrable model corresponding to N=3, since the case N=2 has been considered by the authors in separate papers, both in the one--body case (Lagrange top) and in the n--body one (Lagrange chain). We now obtain a rigid body associated with a Lie--Poisson algebra which is an extension of the Lie--Poisson structure for the two--field top, thus breaking its semidirect product structure. In the second part of the paper we construct an integrable discretization of a suitable continuous Hamiltonian flow for the system. The map is constructed following the theory of B\"acklund transformations for finite--dimensional integrable systems developed by V.B. Kuznetsov and E.K. Sklyanin.
