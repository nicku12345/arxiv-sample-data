In the present paper we consider Riemannian coverings (X,g) \to (M,g) with residually finite covering group \Gamma and compact base space (M,g). In particular, we give two general procedures resulting in a family of deformed coverings (X,g_\eps) \to (M,g_\eps) such that the spectrum of the Laplacian \Delta_{(X_\eps,g_\eps)} has at least a prescribed finite number of spectral gaps provided \eps is small enough.   If \Gamma has a positive Kadison constant, then we can apply results by Br\"uning and Sunada to deduce that \spec \Delta_{(X,g_\eps)} has, in addition, band-structure and there is an asymptotic estimate for the number N(\lambda) of components of \spec {\laplacian {(X,g_\eps)}} that intersect the interval [0,\lambda]. We also present several classes of examples of residually finite groups that fit with our construction and study their interrelations. Finally, we mention several possible applications for our results.
