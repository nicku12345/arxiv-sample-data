In previous paper we have shown that there is a special kind of nonlinear electrodynamics - Curvilinear Wave Electrodynamics (CWED), whose equations are mathematically equivalent to the equations of quantum electrodynamics. The purpose of the present paper is to show that in framework of CWED the known solutions of the nonlinear electromagnetic equations can be considered as the approximate solutions of the nonlinear equation of CWED. Another purpose of this paper is to show, that these solutions allow the description of electron-like particle of CWED as point of non-point particles, depending on mathematical approach.
