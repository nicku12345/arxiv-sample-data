Using the Bogomolnyi inequality and the vanishing of topological charge at the onset of nucleation of a new universe permits a simpler, more direct of how topological defects(kinks and anti kinks) contribute to the onset of initial conditions at the beginning of inflationary cosmology. We find that it is possible to present inflationary cosmology with initial conditions with di-quark pairs formed using an axion wall as a way to start formation of di quarks as soliton-anti soltion type pairs. This allows for a transition to inflationary cosmology congruent with with an initial nucleation state of matter which would have a significant dark matter componet in the beginning. The separation between the di-quark pairs constituents would be due to CP violations in the initial phases of matter creation and would be a convenient trigger for inflationary expansion.
