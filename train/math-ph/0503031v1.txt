In this paper, I consider one-dimensional periodic Schr{\"o}dinger operators perturbed by a slowly decaying potential. In the adiabatic limit, I give an asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalues in the gaps of the periodic operator. When one slides the perturbation along the periodic potential, these eigenvalues oscillate. I compute the exponentially small amplitude of the oscillations.
