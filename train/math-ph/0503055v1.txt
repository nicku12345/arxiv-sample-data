Starting from deformed quantum Heisenberg Lie algebras some realizations are given in terms of the usual creation and annihilation operators of the standard harmonic oscillator. Then the associated algebra eigenstates are computed and give rise to new classes of deformed coherent and squeezed states. They are parametrized by deformed algebra parameters and suitable redefinitions of them as paragrassmann numbers. Some properties of these deformed states also are analyzed.
