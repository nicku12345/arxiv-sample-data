In a previous paper (J. Phys. A 36, 11807 (2003)), we introduced the `asymptotic iteration method' for solving second-order homogeneous linear differential equations. In this paper, we study perturbed problems in quantum mechanics and we use the method to find the coefficients in the perturbation series for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions directly, without first solving the unperturbed problem.
