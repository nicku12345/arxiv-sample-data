We consider set of functions on Poisson manifold related by continues one-parameter group of transformations. Class of vector fields that produce involutive families of functions is investigated and relationship between these vector fields and non-Noether symmetries of Hamiltonian dynamical systems is outlined. Theory is illustrated with sample models: modified Boussinesq system and Broer-Kaup system.
