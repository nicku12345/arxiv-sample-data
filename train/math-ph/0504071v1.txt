E. C. Zeeman [1] has criticized the fact that in all articles and books until that moment (1967) the topology employed to work with the Minkowski space was the Euclidean one. He has proposed a new topology, which was generalized for more general space-times by Goebel [2]. In the Zeeman and Goebel topologies for the space-time, the unique continuous curves are polygonals composed by time-like straight lines and geodesics respectively. In his paper, Goebel proposes a topology for which the continuous curves are polygonals composed by motions of charged particles. Here we obtain in a very simple way a generalization of this topology, valid for any gauge fields, by employing the projection theorem of Kaluza-Klein theories (page 144 of Bleecker [3]). This approach relates Zeeman topologies and Kaluza-Klein, therefore Gauge Theories, what brings insights and points in the direction of a completely geometric theory.
