We consider unitary analogs of 1-dimensional Anderson models on l^2(\Z) defined by the product U_\omega=D_\omega S where S is a deterministic unitary and D_\omega is a diagonal matrix of i.i.d. random phases. The operator S is an absolutely continuous band matrix which depends on a parameter controlling the size of its off-diagonal elements. We prove that the spectrum of U_\omega is pure point almost surely for all values of the parameter of S. We provide similar results for unitary operators defined on l^2(\N) together with an application to orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. We get almost sure localization for polynomials characterized by Verblunski coefficients of constant modulus and correlated random phases.
