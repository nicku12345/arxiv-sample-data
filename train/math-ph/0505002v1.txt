A set of quasi-exactly solvable quantum mechanical potentials associated with the Poeschl-Teller potential, the generalized Poeschl-Teller potential, the Scarf potential, and the harmonic oscillator potential have been studied. Solutions of the Schroedinger equation for each potential have been determined and the eigenstates are expressed in terms of the orthogonal polynomials. The potentials are related to each other by suitable change of variables.
