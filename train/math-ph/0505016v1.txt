We analyze asymptotic scaling properties of a model class of anomalous reaction-diffusion (ARD) equations. Numerical experiments show that solutions to these have, for large t, well defined scaling properties. We suggest a general framework to analyze asymptotic symmetry properties; this provides an analytical explanation of the observed asymptotic scaling properties for the considered ARD equations.
