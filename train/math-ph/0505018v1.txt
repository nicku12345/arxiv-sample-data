The spherical tensor gradient operator {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla), which is obtained by replacing the Cartesian components of \bm{r} by the Cartesian components of \nabla in the regular solid harmonic {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\bm{r}), is an irreducible spherical tensor of rank \ell. Accordingly, its application to a scalar function produces an irreducible spherical tensor of rank \ell. Thus, it is in principle sufficient to consider only multicenter integrals of scalar functions: Higher angular momentum states can be generated by differentiation with respect to the nuclear coordinates. Many of the properties of {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla) can be understood easily with the help of an old theorem on differentiation by Hobson [Proc. London Math. Soc. {\bf 24}, 54 - 67 (1892)]. It follows from Hobson's theorem that some scalar functions of considerable relevance as for example the Coulomb potential, Gaussian functions, or reduced Bessel functions produce particularly compact results if {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla) is applied to them. Fourier transformation is very helpful to understand the properties of {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla) since it produces {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (-\mathrm{i} \bm{p}). It is also possible to apply {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla) to generalized functions, yielding for instance the spherical delta function \delta_{\ell}^{m} (\bm{r}). The differential operator {\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla) can also be used for the derivation of pointwise convergent addition theorems. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by deriving the addition theorem of r^{\nu} {\mathcal{Y}_{\ell}^{m}} (\bm{r}) with \nu \in \mathbb{R}.
