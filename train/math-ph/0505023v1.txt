This study unveils the time-space transforms underlying anomalous diffusion process. Based on this finding, we present the two hypotheses concerning the effect of fractal time-space fabric on physical behaviors and accordingly derive fractional quantum relationships between energy and frequency, momentum and wavenumber which further give rise to fractional Schrodinger equation. As an alternative modeling approach to the standard fractional derivatives, we introduce the concept of the Hausdorff derivative underlying the Hausdorff dimensions of metric spacetime. And in terms of the proposed hypotheses, the Hausdorff derivative is used to derive a linear anomalous transport-diffusion equation underlying anomalous diffusion process. Its Green's function solution turns out to be a new type of stretched Gaussian distribution and is compared with that from the Richardson's diffusion equation.
