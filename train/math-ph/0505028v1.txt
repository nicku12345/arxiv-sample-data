We discuss a classical nonlinear oscillator, which is proved to be a superintegrable system for which the bounded motions are quasiperiodic oscillations and the unbounded (scattering) motions are represented by hyperbolic functions. This oscillator can be seen as a position-dependent mass system and we show a natural quantization prescription admitting a factorization with shape invariance for the n=1 case, and then the energy spectrum is found. Other isochronous systems which can also be considered as a generalization of the harmonic oscillator and admit a nonstandard Lagrangian description are also discussed.
