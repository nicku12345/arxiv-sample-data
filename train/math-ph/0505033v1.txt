We develop the d-bar approach to inverse scattering at fixed energy in dimensions d\ge 3 of [Beals, Coifman 1985] and [Henkin, Novikov 1987]. As a result we propose a stable method for nonlinear approximate finding a potential v from its scattering amplitude f at fixed energy E>0 in dimension d=3. In particular, in three dimensions we stably reconstruct n-times smooth potential v with sufficient decay at infinity, n>3, from its scattering amplitude f at fixed energy E up to O(E^{-(n-3-\epsilon)/2}) in the uniform norm as E\to +\infty for any fixed arbitrary small \epsilon >0 (that is with almost the same decay rate of the error for E\to +\infty as in the linearized case near zero potential).
