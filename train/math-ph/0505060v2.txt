Solutions to the equation \partial_t{\cal E}(x,t)-\frac{i}{2m}\Delta {\cal E}(x,t)=\lambda| S(x,t)|^2{\cal E}(x,t) are investigated, where S(x,t) is a complex Gaussian field with zero mean and specified covariance, and m\ne 0 is a complex mass with {\rm Im}(m)\ge 0. For real m this equation describes the backscattering of a smoothed laser beam by an optically active medium. Assuming that S(x,t) is the sum of a finite number of independent complex Gaussian random variables, we obtain an expression for the value of \lambda at which the q-th moment of | {\cal E}(x,t)| w.r.t. the Gaussian field S diverges. This value is found to be less or equal for all m\ne 0, {\rm Im}(m)\ge 0 and | m| <+\infty than for | m| =+\infty, i.e. when the \Delta {\cal E} term is absent. Our solution is based on a distributional formulation of the Feynman path-integral and the Paley-Wiener theorem.
