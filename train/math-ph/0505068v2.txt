We study the spectrum of a one-dimensional Schroedinger operator perturbed by a fast oscillating potential. The oscillation period is a small parameter. The essential spectrum is found in an explicit form. The existence and multiplicity of the discrete spectrum are studied. The complete asymptotics expansions for the eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions are constructed.
