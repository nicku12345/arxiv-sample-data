We construct the system of generalized coherent states for the quantum Kepler problem corresponds to the homogeneous domain SU(2,2)/S(U(2)\times U(2)). We show that the SU(2,2)-equivariant momentum map for this domain yields the momentum map for the classical Kepler problem via appropriate limiting passage.   We also show that under this passage the average values of quantum observables in this system of coherent states pass into the functions on classical phase space and -i/h times commutator pass into the Poisson bracket.
