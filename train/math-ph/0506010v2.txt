A geometric model for nonholonomic Lagrangian field theory is studied. The multisymplectic approach to such a theory as well as the corresponding Cauchy formalism are discussed. It is shown that in both formulations, the relevant equations for the constrained system can be recovered by a suitable projection of the equations for the underlying free (i.e. unconstrained) Lagrangian system.
