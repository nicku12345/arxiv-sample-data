In the framework of deterministic finslerian models, a mechanism producing dissipative dynamics at the Planck scale is introduced. It is based on a geometric evolution from Finsler to Riemann structures defined in {\bf TM}. Quantum states are generated and interpreted as equivalence classes, composed by the configurations that evolve through an internal dynamics, to the same final state. The existence of an hermitian scalar product in an associated linear space is discussed and related with the quantum pre-Hilbert space. This hermitian product emerges from geometric and statistical considerations. Our scheme recovers the main ingredients of the usual Quantum Mechanics. Several testable consequences of our scheme are discussed and compared with usual Quantum Mechanics. A tentative solution of the cosmological constant problem is proposed, as well as a mechanism for the absence of quantum interferences at classical scales.
