Exact and simple calculation of Thomas rotation and Thomas precessions along a circular world line is presented in an absolute (coordinate-free) formulation of special relativity. Besides the simplicity of calculations the absolute treatment of spacetime allows us to gain a deeper insight into the phenomena of Thomas rotation and Thomas precession.
