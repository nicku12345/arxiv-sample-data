Contribution to the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics (Elsevier, 2006): a brief and (hopefully) pedagogical introduction to quantum field theory models describing particles in external fields is presented. Following the instructions, the only references are a few recommendations for further reading in the first and last sections.
