The Nordstr\"om-Vlasov system describes the evolution of self-gravitating collisionless matter in the framework of a relativistic scalar theory of gravitation. We prove global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions for the corresponding initial value problem in three dimensions when the initial data for the scalar field are smooth and the initial particle density is smooth with compact support.
