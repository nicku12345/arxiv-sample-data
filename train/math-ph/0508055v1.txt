The paper contains generalization of the renormgroup algorithm for boundary value problems of mathematical physics and related concept of the renormgroup symmetry, formulated earlier by authors with reference to models based on differential equations. These algorithm and symmetry are formulated now for models with non local (integral) equations. We discuss in detail and illustrate by examples applications of the generalized algorithm to models with not local terms which appear as linear functionals of the solution.
