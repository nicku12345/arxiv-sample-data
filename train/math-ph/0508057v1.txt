We consider the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell and Vlasov-Nordstr\"om systems which describe large particle ensembles interacting by either electromagnetic fields or a relativistic scalar gravity model. For both systems we derive a radiation formula analogous to the Einstein quadrupole formula in general relativity.
