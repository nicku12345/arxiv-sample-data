We consider a spin 1/2 charged particle on the Lobachevsky plane subjected to a magnetic field corresponding to a discrete system of Aharonov-Bohm solenoids. Let H^+ and H^- be the two components of the Pauli operator for spin up and down, respectively. We show that neither H^+ nor H^- has a zero mode if the number of solenoids is finite. On the other hand, a construction is described of an infinite periodic system of solenoids for which either H^+ or H^- has zero modes depending on the value of the flux carried by the solenoids.
