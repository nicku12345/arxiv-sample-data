Different dynamics, described by kinetic equation and clipping method is shown as well as a role of approximate resonances in wave turbulence theory. Applications of clipping method are sketched for gravity-capillary and drift waves. Brief discussion of possible transition from continuous spectrum (= kinetic equation) to discrete spectrum (= clipping) is given at the end.
