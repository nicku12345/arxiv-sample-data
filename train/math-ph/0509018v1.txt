Attention is focused on quantum spaces of physical importance, i.e. Manin plane, q-deformed Euclidean space in three or four dimensions as well as q-deformed Minkowski space. There are algebra isomorphisms that allow to identify quantum spaces with commutative coordinate algebras. This observation enables the realization of braiding mappings on commutative algebras. The aim of the article is to perform this task explicitly, leading us to formulae for so-called braided products.
