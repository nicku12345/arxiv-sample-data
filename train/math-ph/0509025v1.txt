We show by symplectic realizations of the one dimensional Static group G that the maximal G-elementary system is a a massive particle under an invariant force f participating in the linear momentum and an invariant impetus I participating in the change of position. Moreover the system is characterized by four physical quantities : a mass m, a boost u=\frac{I}{m}, an acceleration a=\frac{f}{m} and an internal energy U. The hamiltonian of the system is a sum of the potential energy V=-fq and a contribution pu of the impetus.
