We describe the behaviour of semiclassical electrodynamics under gauge transformations. For this purpose we observe the structure of Schr\"odinger equation and matricial elements under these transformations. We conclude this theory is not gauge invariant. As a consequence of this fact, we obtain a possible loss of predictability of physical results.
