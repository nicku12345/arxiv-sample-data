We summarize recent works on the stability under disorder of the absolutely continuous spectra of random operators on tree graphs. The cases covered include: Schr\"odinger operators with random potential, quantum graph operators for trees with randomized edge lengths, and radial quasi-periodic operators perturbed by random potentials.
