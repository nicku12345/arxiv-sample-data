The technique of vector differentiation is applied to the problem of the derivation of multipole expansions in four-dimensional space. Explicit expressions for the multipole expansion of the function r^n C_j (\hr) with \vvr=\vvr_1+\vvr_2 are given in terms of tensor products of two hyperspherical harmonics depending on the unit vectors \hr_1 and \hr_2. The multipole decomposition of the function (\vvr_1 \cdot \vvr_2)^n is also derived. The proposed method can be easily generalised to the case of the space with dimensionality larger than four. Several explicit expressions for the four-dimensional Clebsch-Gordan coefficients with particular values of parameters are presented in the closed form.
