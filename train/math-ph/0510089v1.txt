We are interested in quantum systems composed of a finite number of particles and described by Hamiltonians which are random Schrodinger operators H^{\omega}:=-\Delta + V^{\omega}  on L^2(X), where X is a finite dimensional Euclidean space and \Delta is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on X. We consider X as the configuration space of the system and we assume that \{X_n\}_{1\leqslant n \leqslant N_0} is a family of linear subspaces of X. The orthogonal complement of X_n in X is denoted X^{n} and is considered as the configuration space of a subsystem. We assume that V^{\omega} is a sum of potentials v_n^{\omega}: X \longrightarrow \R,\quad 1\leqslant n \leqslant N_0, which are ergodic with respect the translation group of X_n and which are rapidly decaying in any direction of X^{n}. The aim of this paper is to show the existence of a thermodynamical limit. This limit defines an object which is a type of a the integrated density of states in the case of two body systems.
