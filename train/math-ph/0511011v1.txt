The Cauchy problem for the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation with small dispersion of order \epsilon^2, is characterized by the appearance of a zone of rapid modulated oscillations of wave-length of order \epsilon. These oscillations are approximately described by the elliptic solution of KdV where the amplitude, wave-number and frequency are not constant but evolve according to the Whitham equations. In this manuscript we give a quantitative analysis of the discrepancy between the numerical solution of the KdV equation in the small dispersion limit and the corresponding approximate solution for values of \epsilon between 10^{-1} and 10^{-3}. The numerical results are compatible with a difference of order \epsilon within the `interior' of the Whitham oscillatory zone, of order \epsilon^{1/3} at the left boundary outside the Whitham zone and of order \epsilon^{1/2} at the right boundary outside the Whitham zone.
