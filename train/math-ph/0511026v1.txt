A quantum system \s interacts in a successive way with elements \ee of a chain of identical independent quantum subsystems. Each interaction lasts for a duration \tau and is governed by a fixed coupling between \s and \ee. We show that the system, initially in any state close to a reference state, approaches a {\it repeated interaction asymptotic state} in the limit of large times. This state is \tau--periodic in time and does not depend on the initial state. If the reference state is chosen so that \s and \ee are individually in equilibrium at positive temperatures, then the repeated interaction asymptotic state satisfies an average second law of thermodynamics.
