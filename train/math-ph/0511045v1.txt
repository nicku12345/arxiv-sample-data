Let \Omega be some domain in the hyperbolic space \Hn (with n\ge 2) and S_1 the geodesic ball that has the same first Dirichlet eigenvalue as \Omega. We prove the Payne-P\'olya-Weinberger conjecture for \Hn, i.e., that the second Dirichlet eigenvalue on \Omega is smaller or equal than the second Dirichlet eigenvalue on S_1.   We also prove that the ratio of the first two eigenvalues on geodesic balls is a decreasing function of the radius.
