Quantization of electrodynamics in curved space-time in the Lorenz gauge and with arbitrary gauge parameter makes it necessary to study Green functions of non-minimal operators with variable coefficients. Starting from the integral representation of photon Green functions, we link them to the evaluation of integrals involving Gamma-functions. Eventually, the full asymptotic expansion of the Feynman photon Green function at small values of the world function, as well as its explicit dependence on the gauge parameter, are obtained without adding by hand a mass term to the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian. Coincidence limits of second covariant derivatives of the associated Hadamard function are also evaluated, as a first step towards the energy-momentum tensor in the non-minimal case.
