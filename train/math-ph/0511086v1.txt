We discuss magnetic Schrodinger operators perturbed by measures from the generalized Kato class. Using an explicit Krein-like formula for their resolvent, we prove that these operators can be approximated in the strong resolvent sense by magnetic Schrodinger operators with point potentials. Since the spectral problem of the latter operators is solvable, one in fact gets an alternative way to calculate discrete spectra; we illustrate it by numerical calculations in the case when the potential is supported by a circle.
