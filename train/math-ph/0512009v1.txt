In a previous letter, we computed the decay constants of heavy pseudoscalar mesons in the framework of relativistic (instantaneous) Bethe-Salpeter method (full 0^- Salpeter equation), in this letter, we solve the full 1^- Salpeter equation and compute the leptonic decay constants of heavy-heavy and heavy-light vector mesons. The theoretical estimate of mass spectra of these heavy-heavy and heavy-light vector mesons are also presented. Our results for the decay constants and mass spectra include the complete relativistic contributions. We find F_{D^*_s} \approx 375 \pm 24 , F_{D^*} \approx 340 \pm 23 (D^{*0},D^{*\pm}), F_{B^*_s} \approx 272 \pm 20 , F_{B^*} \approx 238 \pm 18 (B^{*0},B^{*\pm}), F_{B^*_c} \approx 418 \pm 24 , F_{J/\Psi} \approx 459 \pm 28 , F_{\Psi(2S)} \approx 364 \pm 24 , F_{\Upsilon} \approx 498 \pm 20  and F_{\Upsilon(2S)} \approx 366 \pm 27  MeV.
