A characterisation of the generators of quantum stochastic cocycles of completely positive (CP) maps is given in terms of the complete dissipativity (CD) of its form-generator. The pseudo-Hilbert dilation of the stochastic form-generator and the pre-Hilbert dilation of the corresponding dissipator is found. The general form of the linear continuous structural maps for the algebra of all bounded operators is derived and the quantum stochastic flow for the corresponding cocycle is outlined. It is proved that any w*-analytical bounded CD form-generator give rise to a quantum stochastic CP cocycle over a von Neumann algebra.
