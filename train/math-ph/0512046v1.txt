The subject of this thesis is the modular group of automorphisms acting on the massive algebra of local observables having their support in bounded open subsets of Minkowski space. After a compact introduction to micro-local analysis and the theory of one-parameter groups of automorphisms, which are used exensively throughout the investigation, we are concerned with modular theory and its consequences in mathematics, e.g., Connes' cocycle theorem and classification of type III factors and Jones' index theory, as well as in physics, e.g., the determination of local von Neumann algebras to be hyperfinite factors of type III_1, the formulation of thermodynamic equilibrium states for infinite-dimensional quantum systems (KMS states) and the discovery of modular action as geometric transformations. However, our main focus are its applications in physics, in particular the modular action as Lorentz boosts on the Rindler wedge, as dilations on the forward light cone and as conformal mappings on the double cone. Subsequently, their most important implications in local quantum physics are discussed.   The purpose of this thesis is to shed more light on the transition from the known massless modular action to the wanted massive one in the case of double cones. First of all the infinitesimal generator of the massive modular group is investigated, especially some assumptions on its structure are verified explicitly for the first time for two concrete examples. Then, two strategies for the calculation of group itself are discussed. Some formalisms and results from operator theory and the method of second quantisation used in this thesis are made available in the appendix.
