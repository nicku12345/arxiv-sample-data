The method of efficient description of long-term behavior of solutions of the non-linear first order ODE \dot\phi+\sin\phi=f for arbitrary periodic f is discussed. The criterion enabling one to separate and identify the qualitatively different solutions is established. The applications of the method to the modeling of dynamics of overdamped Josephson junctions in superconductors are outlined.
