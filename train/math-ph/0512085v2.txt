For mathematical models of quantum wave guides we show that in some situations two interacting particles can be trapped more easily than a single particle. In particular, we give an example of a wave guide that can not bind a single particle, but does have a geometrically induced bound state for two particles that attract each other. We also show that Neumann boundary conditions are `stickier' for two interacting particles than for a single one.
