We consider a polyharmonic operator H=(-\Delta)^l+V(x) in dimension two with l\geq 6 and a limit-periodic potential V(x). We prove that the spectrum of H contains a semiaxis and there is a family of generalized eigenfunctions at every point of this semiaxis with the following properties. First, the eigenfunctions are close to plane waves e^{i< \vec k,\vec x>} at the high energy region. Second, the isoenergetic curves in the space of momenta \vec k corresponding to these eigenfunctions have a form of slightly distorted circles with holes (Cantor type structure).
