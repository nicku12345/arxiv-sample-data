The purpose of this paper is to shed more light on the transition from the known massless modular action to the wanted massive one in the case of forward light cones and double cones. The infinitesimal generator of the massive modular automorphism group is investigated, in particular, some assumptions on its structure are verified explicitly for two concrete examples.
