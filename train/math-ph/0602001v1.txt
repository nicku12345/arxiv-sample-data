The distributions of the smallest and largest eigenvalues for the matrix product Z^\dagger Z, where Z is an n \times m complex Gaussian matrix with correlations both along rows and down columns, are expressed as m \times m determinants. In the case of correlation along rows, these expressions are computationally more efficient than those involving sums over partitions and Schur polynomials reported recently for the same distributions.
