In a previous paper^1, submitted to Journal of Physics A -- we presented an infinite class of potentials for which the radial Schr\"odinger equation at zero energy can be solved explicitely. For part of them, the angular momentum must be zero, but for the other part (also infinite), one can have any angular momentum. In the present paper, we study a simple subclass (also infinite) of the whole class for which the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation is simpler than in the general case. This subclass is obtained by combining another approach together with the general approach of the previous paper. Once this is achieved, one can then see that one can in fact combine the two approaches in full generality, and obtain a much larger class of potentials than the class found in ref. ^1 We mention here that our results are explicit, and when exhibited, one can check in a straightforward manner their validity.
