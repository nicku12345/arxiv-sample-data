The k-cosymplectic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of first-order field theories are reviewed and completed. In particular, they are stated for singular and almost-regular systems. Subsequently, several alternative formulations for k-cosymplectic first-order field theories are developed: First, generalizing the construction of Tulczyjew for mechanics, we give a new interpretation of the classical field equations in terms of certain submanifolds of the tangent bundle of the k^1-velocities of a manifold. Second, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are unified by giving an extension of the Skinner-Rusk formulation on classical mechanics. Finally, both formalisms are formulated in terms of Lie algebroids.
