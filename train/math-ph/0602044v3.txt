The d-dimensional generalization of the point canonical transformation for a quantum particle endowed with a position-dependent mass in Schrodinger equation is described. Illustrative examples including; the harmonic oscillator, Coulomb, spiked harmonic, Kratzer, Morse oscillator, Poschl-Teller and Hulthen potentials are used as reference potentials to obtain exact energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for target potentials at different position-dependent mass settings.
