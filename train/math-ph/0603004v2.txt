With the help of contraction method we study the harmonic oscillator in spaces with degenerate metrics, namely, on Galilei plane and in the flat 3D Cayley-Klein spaces R_3(j_2,j_3). It is shown that the inner degrees of freedom are appeared which physical dimensions are different from the dimension of the space.
