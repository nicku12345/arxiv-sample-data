We study a small quantum system (e.g. a simplified model for an atom or molecule) interacting with two bosonic or fermionic reservoirs (say, photon or phonon fields). We show that the combined system has a family of stationary states, parametrized by two numbers T_1, T_2 (``reservoir temperatures''). If T_1\neq T_2, then these states are non-equilibrium, stationary states (NESS). In the latter case we show that they have nonvanishing heat fluxes and positive entropy production. Furthermore, we show that these states are dynamically asymptotically stable. The latter means that the evolution with an initial condition, normal with respect to any state where the reservoirs are in equilibria at temperatures T_1 and T_2, converges to the corresponding NESS. Our results are valid for the temperatures satisfying the bound \min(T_1, T_2) > g^{2+\alpha}, where g is the coupling constant and 0< \alpha<1 is a power related to the infra-red behaviour of the coupling functions.
