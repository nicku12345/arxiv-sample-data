We investigate the first cohomology space associated with the embedding of the Lie superalgebra \cK(2) of contact vector fields on the (1,2)-dimensional supercircle S^{1\mid 2} in the Lie superalgebra \cS\Psi \cD \cO(S^{1\mid 2}) of superpseudodifferential operators with smooth coefficients. Following Ovsienko and Roger, we show that this space is ten-dimensional with only even cocycles and we give explicit expressions of the basis cocycles.
