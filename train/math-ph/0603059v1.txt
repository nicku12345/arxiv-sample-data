In this paper we announce the result of asymptotic dynamics of solitons of nonlinear Schrodinger equations with external potentials. To each local minima of the potential there is a soliton centered around it. Under some conditions on the nonlinearity, the potential and the datum, we prove that the solution can be decomposed into two parts: the soliton and the term dissipating to infinity.
