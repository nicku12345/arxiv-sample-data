Jets frames, that is a generalisation of ordinary frames on a manifold, are described in a language similar to that of gauge theory. This is achieved by constructing the Cartan geometry of a manifold with respect to the diffeomorphism symmetry. This point of vue allows to give new insights and interpretations in the theory of jet frames, in particular by making an interpolation between ordinary gauge theory concepts and pure jet ones.
