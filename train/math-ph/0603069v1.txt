We study the Fourier transform of polynomials in an orthogonal family, taken with respect to the orthogonality measure. Mastering the asymptotic properties of these transforms, that we call Fourier--Bessel functions, in the argument, the order, and in certain combinations of the two is required to solve a number of problems arising in quantum mechanics. We present known results, new approaches and open conjectures, hoping to justify our belief that the importance of these investigations extends beyond the application just mentioned, and may involve interesting discoveries.
