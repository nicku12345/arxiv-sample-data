The one-dimensional chain of coupled oscillators with long-range power-law interaction is considered. The equation of motion in the infrared limit are mapped onto the continuum equation with the Riesz fractional derivative of order \alpha, when 0<\alpha<2. The evolution of soliton-like and breather-like structures are obtained numerically and compared for both types of simulations: using the chain of oscillators and using the continuous medium equation with the fractional derivative.
