A quantum sl(2,R) coalgebra (with deformation parameter z) is shown to underly the construction of superintegrable Kepler potentials on 3D spaces of variable and constant curvature, that include the classical spherical, hyperbolic and (anti-)de Sitter spaces as well as their non-constant curvature analogues. In this context, the non-deformed limit z = 0 is identified with the flat contraction leading to the proper Euclidean and Minkowskian spaces/potentials. The corresponding Hamiltonians admit three constants of the motion coming from the coalgebra structure. Furthermore, maximal superintegrability of the Kepler potential on the spaces of constant curvature is explicitly shown by finding an additional constant of the motion coming from an additional symmetry that cannot be deduced from the quantum algebra. In this way, the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for such spaces is deduced and its algebraic properties are analysed.
