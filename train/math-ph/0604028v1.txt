A q-deformed version of classical analysis is given to quantum spaces of physical importance, i.e. Manin plane, q-deformed Euclidean space in three or four dimensions, and q-deformed Minkowski space. The subject is presented in a rather complete and selfcontained way. All relevant notions are introduced and explained in detail. The different possibilities to realize the objects of q-deformed analysis are discussed and their elementary properties are studied. In this manner attention is focused on star products, q-deformed tensor products, q-deformed translations, q-deformed partial derivatives, dual pairings, q-deformed exponentials, and q-deformed integration. The main concern of this work is to show that these objects fit together in a consistent framework, which is suitable to formulate physical theories on quantum spaces.
