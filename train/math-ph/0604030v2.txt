Let f\in L^2(S^2) be an arbitrary fixed function with small norm on the unit sphere S^2, and D\subset \R^3 be an arbitrary fixed bounded domain. Let k>0 and \alpha\in S^2 be fixed.   It is proved that there exists a potential q\in L^2(D) such that the corresponding scattering amplitude A(\alpha')=A_q(\alpha')=A_q(\alpha',\alpha,k) approximates f(\alpha') with arbitrary high accuracy: \|f(\alpha')-A_q(\alpha')_{L^2(S^2)}\|\leq\ve where \ve>0 is an arbitrarily small fixed number. This means that the set \{A_q(\alpha')\}_{\forall q\in L^2(D)} is complete in L^2(S^2). The results can be used for constructing nanotechnologically "smart materials".
