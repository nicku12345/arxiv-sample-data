We study the so called crossing estimate for analytic dispersion relations of periodic lattice systems in dimensions three and higher. Under a certain regularity assumption on the behavior of the dispersion relation near its critical values, we prove that an analytic dispersion relation suppresses crossings if and only if it is not a constant on any affine hyperplane. In particular, this will then be true for any dispersion relation which is a Morse function. We also provide two examples of simple lattice systems whose dispersion relations do not suppress crossings in the present sense.
