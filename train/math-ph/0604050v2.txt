A system of two particles with spin s=0 and s=1/2 respectively, moving in a plane is considered. It is shown that such a system with a nontrivial spin-orbit interaction can allow an 8 dimensional Lie algebra of first-order integrals of motion. The Pauli equation is solved in this superintegrable case and reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations when only one first-order integral exists.
