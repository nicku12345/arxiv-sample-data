We demonstrated using an elementary method that the inertia tensor of a material point and the cross product of two vectors were only possible in a three or seven dimensional space. The representation matrix of the cross product in the seven dimensional space and its properties were given. The relationship between the inertia tensor and the octonions algebra was emphasized for the first time in this work.
