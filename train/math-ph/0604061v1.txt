In this paper we discuss constraints on two-dimensional quantum-mechanical systems living in domains with boundaries. The constrains result from the requirement of hermicity of corresponding Hamiltonians. We construct new two-dimensional families of formally exactly solvable systems and applying such constraints show that in real the systems are quasi-exactly solvable at best. Nevertheless in the context of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians some of the constructed families are exactly solvable.
