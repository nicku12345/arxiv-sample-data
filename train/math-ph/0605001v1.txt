The ancestor Gromov--Witten invariants of a compact {\Kahler} manifold X can be organized in a generating function called the total ancestor potential of X. In this paper, we construct Hirota Quadratic Equations (HQE shortly) for the total ancestor potential of \C P^1. The idea is to adopt the formalism developed in \cite{G1,GM} to the mirror model of \C P^1. We hope that the ideas presented here can be generalized to other manifolds as well.   As a corollary, using the twisted loop group formalism from \cite{G3}, we obtain a new proof of the following version of the Toda conjecture: the total descendant potential of \C P^1 (known also as the partition function of the \C P^1 topological sigma model) is a tau-function of the Extended Toda Hierarchy.
