Consider a charged Bose gas without self-interactions, confined in a three dimensional cubic box of side L\geq 1 and subjected to a constant magnetic field B\neq 0. If the bulk density of particles \rho and the temperature T are fixed, then define the canonical magnetization as the partial derivative with respect to B of the reduced free energy. Our main result is that it admits thermodynamic limit for all strictly positive \rho, T and B. It is also proven that the canonical and grand canonical magnetizations (the last one at fixed average density) are equal up to the surface order corrections.
