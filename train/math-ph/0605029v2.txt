We prove that the integrated density of states (IDS) of random Schr\"{o}dinger operators with Anderson-type potentials on L^2 (\R^d), for d \geq1, is locally H\"{o}lder continuous at all energies with the same H\"{o}lder exponent 0<\alpha\leq1 as the conditional probability measure for the single-site random variable. As a special case, we prove that if the probability distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure with a bounded density, then the IDS is Lipschitz continuous at all energies. The single-site potential u\in L\_0^\infty (\R^d) must be nonnegative and compactly-supported. The unperturbed Hamiltonian must be periodic and satisfy a unique continuation principle. We also prove analogous continuity results for the IDS of random Anderson-type perturbations of the Landau Hamiltonian in two-dimensions. All of these results follow from a new Wegner estimate for local random Hamiltonians with rather general probability measures.
