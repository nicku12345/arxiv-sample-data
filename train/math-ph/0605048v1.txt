The material presented here covers two talks given by the authors at the conference Operator Algebras and Mathematical Physics organised in Bucharest in August 2005. The first one was a review given by J. Kellendonk on the relation between bulk and boundary topological invariants in physical systems. In the second talk S. Richard described an application of these ideas to scattering theory. It leads to a topological version of the so-called Levinson's theorem.
