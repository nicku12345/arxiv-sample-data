Under certain constraints on the parameters a, b and c, it is known that Schroedinger's equation   -y"(x)+(ax^6+bx^4+cx^2)y(x) = E y(x), a > 0, with the sextic anharmonic oscillator potential is exactly solvable. In this article we show that the exact wave function y is the generating function for a set of orthogonal polynomials P_n^{(t)}(x) in the energy variable E. Some of the properties of these polynomials are discussed in detail and our analysis reveals scaling and factorization properties that are central to quasi-exact solvability. We also prove that this set of orthogonal polynomials can be reduced,by means of a simple scaling transformation, to a remarkable class of orthogonal polynomials, P_n(E)=P_n^{(0)}(E) recently discovered by Bender and Dunne.
