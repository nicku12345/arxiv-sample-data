In my book ``Large Scale Dynamics of Interacting Particles'' [S] I refer to an unpublished note from early 1985 on the BBGKY hierarchy for hard spheres. My main point there was to provide a direct probabilistic proof for the time-integrated version of the hierarchy. Over recent years there has been repeated interest in this derivation, which encourages me to make my note public. I decided to leave it in its original form including likely inaccuracies. The work of R. Illner and M. Pulvirenti [IP] appeared in September 1985, see also the book by C. Cercignani, R. Illner, and M. Pulvirenti [CIP], who prove the same result using special flow representation and methods from the theory of differential operators. [S] H.
