The Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock (BDF) model is the mean-field approximation of no-photon Quantum Electrodynamics. The present paper is devoted to the study of the minimization of the BDF energy functional under a charge constraint. An associated minimizer, if it exists, will usually represent the ground state of a system of N electrons interacting with the Dirac sea, in an external electrostatic field generated by one or several fixed nuclei. We prove that such a minimizer exists when a binding (HVZ-type) condition holds. We also derive, study and interpret the equation satisfied by such a minimizer.   Finally, we provide two regimes in which the binding condition is fulfilled, obtaining the existence of a minimizer in these cases. The first is the weak coupling regime for which the coupling constant \alpha is small whereas \alpha Z and the particle number N are fixed. The second is the non-relativistic regime in which the speed of light tends to infinity (or equivalently \alpha tends to zero) and Z, N are fixed. We also prove that the electronic solution converges in the non-relativistic limit towards a Hartree-Fock ground state.
