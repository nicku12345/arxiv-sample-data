The Veneziano amplitude for the tree-level scattering of four tachyonic scalar of open string theory has an arithmetic analogue in terms of the p-adic gamma function. We propose a quantum extension of this amplitude using the q-extended p-adic gamma function given by Koblitz. This provides a one parameter deformation of the arithmetic Veneziano amplitude. We also comment on the dificulty in generalising this to higher point amplitudes.
