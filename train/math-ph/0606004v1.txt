In this note we outline some novel connections between the following fields: 1) Convolution calculus on white noise spaces 2) Pseudo-differential operators and L\'evy processes on infinite dimensional spaces 3) Feynman graph representations of convolution semigroups 4) generalized renormalization group flows and 5) the thermodynamic limit of particle systems.
