We consider a pair of adjacent quantum waveguides, in general of different widths, coupled laterally by a pair of windows in the common boundary, not necessarily of the same length, at a fixed distance. The Hamiltonian is the respective Dirichlet Laplacian. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the discrete spectrum as the window distance tends to infinity for the generic case, i.e. for eigenvalues of the corresponding one-window problems separated from the threshold.
