We investigate a generalization of A_r statistics discussed recently in the literature. The explicit complete set of state vectors for the A_r statistics system is given. We consider a Bargmann or an analytic function description of the Fock space corresponding to A_r statistics of bosonic kind. This brings, in a natural way, the so-called Gazeau-Klauder coherent states defined as eigenstates of the Jacobson annihilation operators. The minimization of Robertson uncertainty relation is also considered.
