Let A_q(\alpha',\alpha,k) be the scattering amplitude, corresponding to a local potential q(x), x\in\R^3, q(x)=0 for |x|>a, where a>0 is a fixed number, \alpha',\alpha\in S^2 are unit vectors, S^2 is the unit sphere in \R^3, \alpha is the direction of the incident wave, k^2>0 is the energy. We prove that given an arbitrary function f(\alpha')\in L^2(S^2), an arbitrary fixed \alpha_0\in S^2, an arbitrary fixed k>0, and an arbitrary small \ve>0, there exists a potential q(x)\in L^2(D), where D\subset R^3 is a bounded domain such that \bee   \|A_q(\alpha',\alpha_0,k)-f(\alpha')\|_{L^2(S^2)}<\ve. \tag{\ast}\eee The potential q, for which (\ast) holds, is nonunique. We give an method for finding q, and a formula for such a q.
