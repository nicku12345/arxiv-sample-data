We study electron densities of eigenfunctions of atomic Schroedinger operators. We prove the existence of rho~'''(0), the third derivative of the spherically averaged atomic density rho~ at the nucleus. For eigenfunctions with corresponding eigenvalue below the essential spectrum we obtain the bound rho~'''(0) \leq -(7/12)Z^3 rho~(0), where Z denotes the nuclear charge. This bound is optimal.
