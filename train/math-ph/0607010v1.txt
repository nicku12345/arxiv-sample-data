We examine spectra of Dirac operators on compact hyperbolic surfaces. Particular attention is devoted to symmetry considerations, leading to non-trivial multiplicities of eigenvalues. The relation to spectra of Maass-Laplace operators is also exploited. Our main result is a Selberg trace formula for Dirac operators on hyperbolic surfaces.
