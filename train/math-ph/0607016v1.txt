We use the eigenfunction method to calculate the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients for the permutation group . This method is well-established by Jin-Quan Chen. Here we elaborate the detailed procedures for the pedagogical purpose. Due to the nature of the symmetry, one may get the degeneracy from the solution of eigenfunctions for given one class operator. In order to remove the degeneracy we use extra class operators, which may be the subgroup class operator or even the state permutation operator. In doing so, a variety of eigenvalues come out. Every eigenfunction is therefore obtained, and basis vectors are completely found.
