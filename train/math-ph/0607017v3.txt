We study the limiting behavior of \Tr U^{k(n)}, where U is a n\times n random unitary matrix and k(n) is a natural number that may vary with n in an arbitrary way. Our analysis is based on the connection with Toeplitz determinants. The central observation of this paper is a strong Szeg\"o limit theorem for Toeplitz determinants associated to symbols depending on n in a particular way. As a consequence to this result, we find that for each fixed m\in \N, the random variables  \Tr U^{k_j(n)}/\sqrt{\min(k_j(n),n)}, j=1,..., m, converge to independent standard complex normals.
