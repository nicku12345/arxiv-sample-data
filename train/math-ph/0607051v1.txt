The problem of studying the quantum Hall effect on manifolds with nonconstant metric is addressed. The Hamiltonian on a space with hyperbolic metric is determined, and the spectrum and eigenfunctions are calculated in closed form. The hyperbolic disk is also considered and some other applications of this approach are discussed as well.
