There are two classes of quantum integrable systems on a manifold with quadratic integrals, the Liouville and the Lie integrable systems as it happens in the classical case. The quantum Liouville quadratic integrable systems are defined on a Liouville manifold and the Schr\"odinger equation can be solved by separation of variables in one coordinate system. The Lie integrable systems are defined on a Lie manifold and are not generally separable ones but the can be solved. Therefore there are superintegrable systems with two quadratic integrals of motion not necessarily separable in two coordinate systems. The quantum analogues of the two dimensional superintegrable systems with quadratic integrals of motion on a manifold are classified by using the quadratic associative algebra of the integrals of motion. There are six general fundamental classes of quantum superintegrable systems corresponding to the classical ones. Analytic formulas for the involved integrals are calculated in all the cases. All the known quantum superintegrable systems are classified as special cases of these six general classes. The coefficients of the associative algebra of the general cases are calculated. These coefficients are the same as the coefficients of the classical case multiplied by -\hbar^2 plus quantum corrections of order \hbar^4 and \hbar^6.
