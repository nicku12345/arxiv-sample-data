I investigate contractions via Kac-Moody formalism. In particular, I show how the symmetry algebra of the standard 2-D Kepler system, which was identified by Daboul and Slodowy as an infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody loop algebra, and was denoted by {\mathbb H}_2 , gets reduced by the symmetry breaking term, defined by the Hamiltonian \[ H(\beta)= \frac 1 {2m} (p_1^2+p_2^2)- \frac \alpha r - \beta r^{-1/2} \cos ((\phi-\gamma)/2). \] For this H (\beta) I define two symmetry loop algebras {\mathfrak L}_{i}(\beta), i=1,2, by choosing the `basic generators' differently. These {\mathfrak L}_{i}(\beta) can be mapped isomorphically onto subalgebras of {\mathbb H}_2 , of codimension 2 or 3, revealing the reduction of symmetry. Both factor algebras {\mathfrak L}_i(\beta)/I_i(E,\beta), relative to the corresponding energy-dependent ideals I_i(E,\beta), are isomorphic to {\mathfrak so}(3) and {\mathfrak so}(2,1) for E<0 and E>0, respectively, just as for the pure Kepler case. However, they yield two different non-standard contractions as E \to 0, namely to the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra {\mathfrak h}_3={\mathfrak w}_1 or to an abelian Lie algebra, instead of the Euclidean algebra {\mathfrak e}(2) for the pure Kepler case. The above example suggests a general procedure for defining generalized contractions, and also illustrates the {\em `deformation contraction hysteresis'}, where contraction which involve two contraction parameters can yield different contracted algebras, if the limits are carried out in different order.
