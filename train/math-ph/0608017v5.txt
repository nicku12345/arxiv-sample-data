In this paper using the Clifford bundle formalism a Lagrangian theory of the Yang-Mills type (with a gauge fixing term and an auto interacting term) for the gravitational field in Minkowski spacetime is presented. It is shown how two simple hypothesis permit the interpretation of the formalism in terms of effective Lorentzian or teleparallel geometries. In the case of a Lorentzian geometry interpretation of the theory the field equations are shown to be equivalent to Einstein's equations.
