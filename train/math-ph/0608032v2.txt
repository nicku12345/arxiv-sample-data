We present an explicit description of the 'fine group gradings' (i.e. group gradings which cannot be further refined) of the real forms of the semisimple Lie algebras sl(4,\C), sp(4,\C), and o(4,\C). All together 12 real Lie algebras are considered, and the total of 44 of their fine group gradings are listed.   The inclusions sl(4,\C)\supset sp(4,\C)\supset o(4,\C) are an important tool in our presentation. Systematic use is made of the faithful representations of the three Lie algebras by 4\times 4 matrices.
