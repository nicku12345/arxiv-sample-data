Starting from a characterization of admissible Cheataev and vakonomic variations in a field theory with constraints we show how the so called parametrized variational calculus can help to derive the vakonomic and the non-holonomic field equations. We present an example in field theory where the non-holonomic method proved to be unphysical.
