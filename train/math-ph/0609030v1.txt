Superanalysis can be deformed with a fermionic star product into a Clifford calculus that is equivalent to geometric algebra. With this multivector formalism it is then possible to formulate Riemannian geometry and an inhomogeneous generalization of exterior calculus. Moreover it is shown here how symplectic and Poisson geometry fit in this context. The application of this formalism together with the bosonic star product formalism of deformation quantization leads then on space and space-time to a natural appearance of spin structures and on phase space to BRST structures that were found in the path integral formulation of classical mechanics. Furthermore it will be shown that Poincare and Lie-Poisson reduction can be formulated in this formalism.
