We consider the Q-state Potts model on \mathbb Z^d, Q\ge 3, d\ge 2, with Kac ferromagnetic interactions and scaling parameter \ga. We prove the existence of a first order phase transition for large but finite potential ranges. More precisely we prove that for \ga small enough there is a value of the temperature at which coexist Q+1 Gibbs states. The proof is obtained by a perturbation around mean-field using Pirogov-Sinai theory. The result is valid in particular for d=2, Q=3, in contrast with the case of nearest-neighbor interactions for which available results indicate a second order phase transition. Putting both results together provides an example of a system which undergoes a transition from second to first order phase transition by changing only the finite range of the interaction.
