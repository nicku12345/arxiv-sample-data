We study the evolution of a one dimensional model atom with \delta-function binding potential, subjected to a dipole radiation field E(t) x with E(t) a 2\pi/\omega-periodic real-valued function. Starting with \psi(x,t=0) an initially localized state and E(t) a trigonometric polynomial, complete ionization occurs; the probability of finding the electron in any fixed region goes to zero.   For \psi(x,0) compactly supported and general periodic fields, we construct a resonance expansion. Each resonance is given explicitly as a Gamow vector, and is 2\pi/\omega periodic in time and behaves like the exponentially growing Green's function near x=\pm \infty. The remainder is given by an asymptotic power series in t^{-1/2} with coefficients varying with x.
