We determine for each of the simple, simply connected, compact and complex Lie groups SU(n), Spin(4n+2) and E_6 that particular region inside the unit disk in the complex plane which is filled by their mean eigenvalues. We give analytical parameterizations for the boundary curves of these so-called trace figures. The area enclosed by a trace figure turns out to be a rational multiple of \pi in each case. We calculate also the length of the boundary curve and determine the radius of the largest circle that is contained in a trace figure. The discrete center of the corresponding compact complex Lie group shows up prominently in the form of cusp points of the trace figure placed symmetrically on the unit circle. For the exceptional Lie groups G_2, F_4 and E_8 with trivial center we determine the (negative) lower bound on their mean eigenvalues lying within the real interval [-1,1]. We find the rational boundary values -2/7, -3/13 and -1/31 for G_2, F_4 and E_8, respectively.
