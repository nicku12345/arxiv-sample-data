We consider the weak coupling limit for a quantum system consisting of a small subsystem and reservoirs. It is known rigorously since [Dav74] that the Heisenberg evolution restricted to the small system converges in an appropriate sense to a Markovian semigroup. In the nineties, Accardi, Frigerio and Lu [AFL90] initiated an investigation of the convergence of the unreduced unitary evolution to a singular unitary evolution generated by a quantum Langevin equation.   We present a version of this convergence which is both simpler and stronger than the formulations which we know. Our main result says that in an appropriately understood weak coupling limit the interaction of the small system with environment can be expressed in terms of the so-called quantum white noise.
