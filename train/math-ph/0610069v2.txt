By studying various rational integrable maps on \mathbf{\hat C}^d with p invariants, we show that periodic points form an invariant variety of dimension \ge p for each period, in contrast to the case of nonintegrable maps in which they are isolated. We prove the theorem: {\it `If there is an invariant variety of periodic points of some period, there is no set of isolated periodic points of other period in the map.'}
