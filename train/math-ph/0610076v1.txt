A countable set of asymptotic space -- localized solutions is constructed by the complex germ method in the adiabatic approximation for 3D Hartree type equations with a quadratic potential. The asymptotic parameter is 1/T, where T\gg1 is the adiabatic evolution time.   A generalization of the Berry phase of the linear Schr\"odinger equation is formulated for the Hartree type equation. For the solutions constructed, the Berry phases are found in explicit form.
