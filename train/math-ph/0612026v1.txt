The recently modified Faddeev-Jackiw formalism for systems having one chain of four levels of only second-class constraints is applied to the non-trivial a=1 bosonized chiral Schwinger model in (1+1) dimensions as well as to one mechanical system. The sets of obtained constraints are in agreement with Dirac's canonical formulation.
