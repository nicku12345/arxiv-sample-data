The correlation function of a one-dimensional interface over a random substrate, bound to the substrate by a pressure term, is studied by Monte-Carlo simulation. It is found that the height correlation < h_i ; h_{i+j} >, averaged over the substrate disorder, fits a form exp(-(j/b)^c) to a surprising precision in the full range of j where the correlation is non-negligible. The exponent c increases from 1.0 to 1.5 when the interface tension is taken larger and larger.
