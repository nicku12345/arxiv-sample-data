Using an adelic approach we simultaneously consider real and p-adic aspects of dynamical systems whose states are mapped by linear fractional transformations isomorphic to some subgroups of GL (2, Q), SL (2, Q) and SL (2, Z) groups. In particular, we investigate behavior of these adelic systems when fixed points are rational. It is shown that any of these rational fixed points is p-adic indifferent for all but a finite set of primes. Thus only for finite number of p-adic cases a rational fixed point may be attractive or repelling. It is also shown that real and p-adic norms of any nonzero rational fixed point are connected by adelic product formula.
