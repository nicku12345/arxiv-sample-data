In this paper I reconsider the use of the left ideals of the even-grade subalgebra of spacetime algebra to describe fermionic excitations. When interpreted as rotors the general elements of an even-grade left-ideal describe massless particles in chiral flavour doublets. To study the application of these ideas to the standard Dirac formalism I construct a 2 \times 2-matrix representation with bivector insertions for the Dirac algebra. This algebra has four ideals, and this approach clarifies how the identification of Dirac \g_{\mu}-matrices with orthonormal basisvectors {\bf e}_{\nu} annihilates half of the ideals. For one possible choice of this mapping the remaining ideals the chiral left- and righthanded components of the fermion coincide with the even- and odd elements of spacetime algebra.
