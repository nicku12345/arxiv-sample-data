Consider the family of Schr\"odinger operators (and also its Dirac version) on \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}) or \ell^2(\mathbb{N}) \[ H^W_{\omega,S}=\Delta + \lambda F(S^n\omega) + W, \quad \omega\in\Omega, \] where S is a transformation on (compact metric) \Omega, F a real Lipschitz function and W a (sufficiently fast) power-decaying perturbation. Under certain conditions it is shown that H^W_{\omega,S} presents quasi-ballistic dynamics for \omega in a dense G_{\delta} set. Applications include potentials generated by rotations of the torus with analytic condition on F, doubling map, Axiom A dynamical systems and the Anderson model. If W is a rank one perturbation, examples of H^W_{\omega,S} with quasi-ballistic dynamics and point spectrum are also presented.
