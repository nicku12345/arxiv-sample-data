The existence of potential energy landscape in the glass transition has been theoretically proved using the recursive equation of reinforce-restraint of self-similar 8 orders of Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential fluctuations. The stability condition for fluctuation reinforce-restraint is just the Lindemann ratio that is exactly deduced as 0.1047in this paper. The origin and transfer of interface excitation comes of the balance between self-similar L-J potential fluctuation and geometric phase potential fluctuation, which also gives rise to a new attractive potential of -17/16\epsilon_i, lower than the potential well energy -\epsilon_i of i-th order of L-J potential, in the self-similar mean field of mean fields of different sizes. The delocalization energy of two-body is exactly the transfer energy of excited interface, and the delocalization path is along 8 orders of geodesics in topological analyses.
