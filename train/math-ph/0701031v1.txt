Properties of sharp observables (normalized PV measures) in relation to smearing by a Markov kernel are studied. It is shown that for a sharp observable P defined on a standard Borel space, and an arbitrary observable M, the following properties are equivalent: (a) the range of P is contained in the range of M; (b) P is a function of M; (c) P is a smearing of M.
