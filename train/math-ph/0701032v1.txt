Observables on effect algebras and their fuzzy versions obtained by means of confidence measures (Markov kernels) are studied. It is shown that, on effect algebras with the (E)-property, given an observable and a confidence measure, there exists a fuzzy version of the observable. Ordering of observables according to their fuzzy properties is introduced, and some minimality conditions with respect to this ordering are found. Applications of some results of classical theory of experiments are considered.
