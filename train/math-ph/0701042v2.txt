As a supplement of our previous work, we consider the localized region of the random Schroedinger operators on l^2({\bf Z}^d) and study the point process composed of their eigenvalues and corresponding localization centers. For the Anderson model, we show that, this point process in the natural scaling limit converges in distribution to the Poisson process on the product space of energy and space. In other models with suitable Wegner-type bounds, we can at least show that any limiting point processes are infinitely divisible.
