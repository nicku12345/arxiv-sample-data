We have shown that Reflection Symmetric transformation is Lorentz invariant. It ia also associative. We have also shown that Reflection Symmetric sum of vectors has a spin-like term comparable to the spin of Dirac eletron. We have found that the sum is bounded, as a consequence of reflection symmetry. This boundedness corresponds to Einstein's postulate.
