Wigner phase space quasi-probability distribution function is a Fourier transform related to a given quantum mechanical wave function. It is shown that for the wave functions of type \psi (q)=e^{-aq^2}\phi (q), the Wigner function can be defined in terms of differential operators acting on a given function, independently from the integral formula which appears in the standard definition. Gaussian wave packet, harmonic and singular oscillators are given as the examples.
