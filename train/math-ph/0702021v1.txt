Consider in L^2(\R^2) the operator family H(\epsilon):=P_0(\hbar,\omega)+\epsilon F_0. P_0 is the quantum harmonic oscillator with diophantine frequency vector \om, F_0 a bounded pseudodifferential operator with symbol decreasing to zero at infinity in phase space, and \ep\in\C. Then there exist \ep^\ast >0 independent of \hbar and an open set \Omega\subset\C^2\setminus\R^2 such that if |\ep|<\ep^\ast and \om\in\Om the quantum normal form near P_0 converges uniformly with respect to \hbar. This yields an exact quantization formula for the eigenvalues, and for \hbar=0 the classical Cherry theorem on convergence of Birkhoff's normal form for complex frequencies is recovered.
