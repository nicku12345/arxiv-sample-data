A new finite-range electromagnetic (EM) theory containing both electric and magnetic charges constructed using two vector potentials A^{} and Z^{} is formulated in the spacetime algebra (STA) and in the algebra of the three-dimensional physical space (APS) formalisms. Lorentz, local gauge and EM duality invariances are discussed in detail in the APS formalism. Moreover, considerations about signature and dimensionality of spacetime are discussed. Finally, the two formulations are compared. STA and APS are equally powerful in formulating our model, but the presence of a global commuting unit pseudoscalar in the APS formulation and the consequent possibility of providing a geometric interpretation for the imaginary unit employed throughout classical and quantum physics lead us to prefer the APS approach.
