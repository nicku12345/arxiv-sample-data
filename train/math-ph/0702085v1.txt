We investigate the parameter dynamics of eigenvalues of Hamiltonians ('level dynamics') defined on symmetric spaces relevant for condensed matter and particle physics. In particular we: 1) identify appropriate reduced manifold on which the motion takes place, 2) identify the correct Poisson structure ensuring the Hamiltonian character of the reduced dynamics, 3) determine the canonical measure on the reduced space, 4) calculate the resulting eigenvalue density.
