In the present paper we study subsolutions of the Dirac equation. The known examples of such subsolutions are the Weyl neutrino and the Majorana neutrino. It is shown that the Dirac equation for a massive non-interacting particle admits another decomposition into two separate equations. It is suggested that such particles can be identified with weakly interacting massive particles, other than neutrinos and of non-exotic nature, which can be candidates for dark matter.
