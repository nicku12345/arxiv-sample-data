Using a general theorem on conservation laws for arbitrary differential equations proved by Ibragimov, we have derived conservation laws for Dirac's symmetrized Maxwell-Lorentz equations under the assumption that both the electric and magnetic charges obey linear conductivity laws (dual Ohm's law). We find that this linear system allows for conservation laws which are non-local in time.
