In the present work a general frame for the scattering theory of local, relativistic dipole quantum fields is presented and some models of interacting dipole fields are considered, i.e. local, relativistic quantum fields with indefinite metric which asymptotically do not converge to free fields, but to free dipole fields. Also, we give explicit formulae for the (nontrivial) scattering matrix of dipole in- and out- fields for these models. Furthermore we show how related dipole degrees of freedom occur in the perturbation theory of certain two dimensional models, e.g. massive sine-Gordon or sinh-Gordon models.
