Using the biquaternions algebra with involution and mutual quaternional gradients the equations of one model of electro-gravimagnetic (EGM) field are constructed on the base of Hamilton form of Maxwell equations. For this field the hypothesis of equivalence of magnetic charge to gravitational mass is implied. The equations of interaction of generated by different charges and currents EGM-fields are built. On its base the analogies of three Newton's laws are obtained. The laws of transformation and conservation of energy by interaction of fields are obtained.
