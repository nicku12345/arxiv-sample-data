We discuss approximations of the vertex coupling on a star-shaped quantum graph of n edges in the singular case when the wave functions are not continuous at the vertex and no edge-permutation symmetry is present. It is shown that the Cheon-Shigehara technique using \delta interactions with nonlinearly scaled couplings yields a 2n-parameter family of boundary conditions in the sense of norm resolvent topology. Moreover, using graphs with additional edges one can approximate the {n+1\choose 2}-parameter family of all time-reversal invariant couplings.
