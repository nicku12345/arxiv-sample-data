In this paper we give a thoughtful exposition of the hyperbolic Clifford algebra of multivecfors which is naturally associated with a hyperbolic space, whose elements are called vecfors. Geometrical interpretation of vecfors and multivecfors are given. Poincare automorphism (Hodge dual operator) is introduced and several useful formulas derived. The role of a particular ideal in the hyperbolic Clifford algebra whose elements are representatives of spinors and resume the algebraic properties of Witten superfields is discussed.
