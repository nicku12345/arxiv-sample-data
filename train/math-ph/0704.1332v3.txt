The goal of this paper is to provide estimates leading to a direct proof of the exponential decay of the n-point correlation functions for certain unbounded models of Kac type. The methods are based on estimating higher order derivatives of the solution of the Witten Laplacian equation on one forms associated with the hamiltonian of the system. We also provide a formula for the Taylor coefficients of the pressure that is suitable for a direct proof the analyticity.
