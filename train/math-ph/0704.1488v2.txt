We consider the equation rotB+aB=0 (1) in the plane with a being a real-valued function and show that it can be reduced to a Vekua equation of a special form. In the case when a depends on one Cartesian variable a complete system of exact solutions of the Vekua equation and hence of equation (1) is constructed based on L. Bers' theory of formal powers.
