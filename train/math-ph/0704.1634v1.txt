We obtain a set of generalized eigenvectors that provides a generalized spectral decomposition for a given unitary representation of a commutative, locally compact topological group. These generalized eigenvectors are functionals belonging to the dual space of a rigging on the space of square integrable functions on the character group. These riggings are obtained through suitable spectral measure spaces.
