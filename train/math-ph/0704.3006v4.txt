Traditionally, it is understood that fluctuations in the equilibrium distribution are not evident in thermodynamic systems of large N (the number of particles in the system) \cite{Huang1}. In this paper we examine the validity of this perception by investigating whether such fluctuations can in reality depend on temperature.   Firstly, we describe fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the energy levels for an isolated system, using previously unknown identities that we have derived for the purpose, which allow us to calculate the moments of the occupation numbers. Then we compute analytically the probability distribution of these fluctuations. We show that, for every system of fixed and finite N, fluctuations about the equilibrium distribution do, in fact, depend on the temperature. Indeed, at higher temperatures the fluctuations can be so large that the system does not fully converge on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution but actually fluctuates around it. We term this state, where not one macrostate but a region of macrostates closely fit the underlying distribution, a ``{\it fluctuating equilibrium}''. Finally, we speculate on how this finding is applicable to networks, financial markets, and other thermodynamic-like systems.
