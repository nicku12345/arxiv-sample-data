Four new exactly solvable, real and shape-invariant potentials associated with a position-dependent effective mass are generated within the concept of shape-invariant potentials using a specific ansatz for superpotential. The accompanying energy spectra of the bound-state and the ground-state wavefunction are obtained algebraically as a function of free parameters and the results are compared with those of others works in the litterature.
