We consider for the time-dependent Maxwell's equations the inverse problem of identifying locations and certain properties of small electromagnetic inhomogeneities in a homogeneous background medium from dynamic measurements of the tangential component of the magnetic field on the boundary (or a part of the boundary) of a domain.
