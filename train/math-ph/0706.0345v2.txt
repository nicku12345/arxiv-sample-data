We present a variety of series representations of the Stieltjes and related constants, the Stieltjes constants being the coefficients of the Laurent expansion of the Hurwitz zeta function zeta(s,a) about s=1. Additionally we obtain series and integral representations of a sum S_\gamma(n) formed as an alternating binomial series from the Stieltjes constants. The slowly varying sum S_\gamma(n)+n is an important subsum in application of the Li criterion for the Riemann hypothesis.
