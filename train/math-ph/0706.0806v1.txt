We consider the quantum scattering from a random potential of strength \lambda^{1/2} and with a support on the scale of the mean free path, which is of order \lambda^{-1}. On the basis of maximally crossed diagrams we provide a concise formula for the backscattering rate in terms of the Green's function for the kinetic Boltzmann equation. We briefly discuss the extension to wave scattering.
