In the first part of this paper math-ph/0612078, a complete description of Q-conditional symmetries for two classes of reaction-diffusion-convection equations with power diffusivities is derived. It was shown that all the known results for reaction-diffusion equations with power diffusivities follow as particular cases from those obtained in math-ph/0612078 but not vise versa. In the second part the symmetries obtained in are successfully applied for constructing exact solutions of the relevant equations. In the particular case, new exact solutions of nonlinear reaction-diffusion-convection (RDC) equations arising in application and their natural generalizations are found.
