We present a discrete multiscale expansion of the lattice potential Korteweg-de Vries (lpKdV) equation on functions of infinite order of slow-varyness. To do so we introduce a formal expansion of the shift operator on many lattices holding at all orders. The lowest secularity condition from the expansion of the lpKdV equation gives a nonlinear lattice equation, depending on shifts of all orders, of the form of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation
