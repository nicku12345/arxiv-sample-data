Contrary to its initial idea, Belnap's (1992) theory of Branching Space-Times (BST) has models in which histories do not resemble relativistic space-times or any other physical space-times. The aim of this paper is to define a certain class of BST models, called "Minkowskian Branching Structures" (MBS), in which histories are isomorphic to Minkowski space-time. By focusing on these models rather than on general BST models, we hope that one may be able to improve on earlier BST analyzes of physical phenomena. Also, introducing MBS' sets the stage for recent discussions about whether or not `branching is a bad idea', physically speaking.
