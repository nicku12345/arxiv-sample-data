In this paper we extend general results obtained by V. Kac and J. Liberati, in "Unitary quasifinite representations of W_\infty", (Letters Math. Phys., 53 (2000), 11-27), for quasifinite highest weight representations of \Z-graded Lie algebras to {1/2}\Z-graded Lie superalgebras, and we apply these to classify the irreducible quasifinite highest weight modules of the Lie superalgebra of quantum pseudo-differential operators.
