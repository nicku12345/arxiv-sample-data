Motivated by recent developments on large deviations in states of the spin chain, we reconsider the work of Petz, Raggio and Verbeure in 1989 on the variational expression of free energy density in the presence of a mean field type perturbation. We extend their results from the product state case to the Gibbs state case in the setting of translation-invariant interactions of finite range. In the special case of a locally faithful quantum Markov state, we clarify the relation between two different kinds of free energy densities (or pressure functions).
