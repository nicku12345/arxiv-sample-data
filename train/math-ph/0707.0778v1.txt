This paper is a response to an article (R. de la Madrid, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General, 39,9255-9268 (2006)) recently published in Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical. The article claims that the theory of resonances and decaying states based on certain rigged Hilbert spaces of Hardy functions is physically untenable. In this paper we show that all of the key conclusions of the cited article are the result of either the errors in mathematical reasoning or an inadequate understanding of the literature on the subject.
