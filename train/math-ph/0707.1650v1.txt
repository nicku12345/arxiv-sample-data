The self-consistent interaction between a beam of charged particles and a wave is considered, within a Vlasov picture. The model is discussed with reference to the case of a Free Electron Laser. Starting with a spatially bunched waterbag distribution, we derive, via perturbative methods, closed analytical expressions for the time evolution of the main macroscopic observables. Predictions of the theory are shown to agree with direct numerical simulations.
