We present a technique for reconstructing a semi-infinite Jacobi operator in the limit circle case from the spectra of two different self-adjoint extensions. Moreover, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for two real sequences to be the spectra of two different self-adjoint extensions of a Jacobi operator in the limit circle case.
