In this article we introduce a class of generalisations of the Jordan-Schwinger (JS) map which realises the recent proposed generalised sl(2) (G-sl(2)) algebra via two independent Generalised Heisenberg Algebras (GHA). Although the GHA and the G-sl(2) algebra exhibit more general algebraic structures than the Heisenberg and sl(2) algebras, the generalised JS map presents a compact and simple structure wich includes the standard JS map as a particular case. Finally, since in the GHA there is a physical interpretation in terms of composite particles, we will carry out this assertion in a manner that the generalised sl(2) algebra could be related to composite particles with angular momentum.
