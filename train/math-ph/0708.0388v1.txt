We generalize the previously given algebraic version of "Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations" to noncommutative configuration spaces. By doing so, we also obtain an axiomatic formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics over such spaces, which, in contrast to most examples discussed in the literature, does not rely on a distinguished set of coordinates. We give a detailed account of several examples, e.g., of nonabelian Yang-Mills theories, and of noncommutative tori. Moreover we, examine models over the Moyal-deformed plane. Assuming the conservation of electrical charges, we show that in this case the canonical uncertainty relation [x_k, \dot{x}_l] = ig_{kl} with metric g_{kl} is only consistent if g_{kl} is constant.
