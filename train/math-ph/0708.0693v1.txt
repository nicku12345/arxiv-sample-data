Two new analytical solutions of self-induction equation, in Riemannian manifolds are presented. The first represents a twisted magnetic flux tube or flux rope in plasma astrophysics, which shows that the depending on rotation of the flow the poloidal field is amplified from toroidal field which represents a dynamo. The value of the amplification depends on the Frenet torsion of the magnetic axis of the tube. Actually this result illustrates the Zeldovich stretch, twist and fold (STF) method to generate dynamos from straight and untwisted ropes. Motivated by the fact that this problem was treated using a Riemannian geometry of twisted magnetic flux ropes recently developed (Phys Plasmas (2006)), we investigated a second dynamo solution which is conformally related to the Arnold kinematic fast dynamo. In this solution it is shown that the conformal effect on the fast dynamo metric only enhances the Zeldovich stretch, and therefore a new dynamo solution is obtained. When a conformal mapping is performed in Arnold fast dynamo line element a uniform stretch is obtained in the original line element.
