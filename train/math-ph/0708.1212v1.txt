In the paper a one-dimensional model with nearest - neighbor interactions I_n, n\in \Z and spin values \pm 1 is considered. It is known that under some conditions on parameters I_n the phase transition occurs for the model. We define a notion of "phase separation" point between two phases. We prove that the expectation value of the point is zero and its the mean square fluctuation is bounded by a constant C(\beta) which tends to 1/4 if \beta\to\infty. Here \beta=\frac{1}{T},  T>0-temperature.
