In this paper, first a class of fractional differential equations are obtained by using the fractional variational principles. We find a fractional Lagrangian L(x(t), where _a^cD_t^\alpha x(t)) and 0<\alpha< 1, such that the following is the corresponding Euler-Lagrange % \begin{equation}_tD_b^\alpha(_a^cD_t^\alpha) x(t)+ b(t,x(t))(_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t))+f(t,x(t))=0. \end{equation} % At last, exact solutions for some Euler-Lagrange equations are presented. In particular, we consider the following equations % \begin{equation}_tD_b^\alpha(_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t))=\lambda x(t), (\lambda\in R) \end{equation} % \begin{equation}_tD_b^\alpha(_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t))+g(t)_a^cD_t^\alpha x(t)=f(t), \end{equation} where g(t) and f(t) are suitable functions.
