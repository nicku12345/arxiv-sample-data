The conditions for R-separation of variables for the conformally invariant Laplace equation on an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold are determined and compared with the conditions for the additive separation of the null geodesic Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The case of 3-dimensions is examined in detail and it is proven that on any conformally flat manifold the two equations separate in the same coordinates.
