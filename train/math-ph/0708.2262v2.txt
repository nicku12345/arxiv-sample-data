The principle of local gauge invariance is applied to fractional wave equations and the interaction term is determined up to order o(\bar{g}) in the coupling constant \bar{g}. As a first application, based on the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative definition, the fractional Zeeman effect is used to reproduce the baryon spectrum accurately.   The transformation properties of the non relativistic fractional Schr\"odinger-equation under spatial rotations are investigated and an internal fractional spin is deduced.
