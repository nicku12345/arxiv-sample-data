We study the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of Toeplitz matrices generated by a singular symbol. It has been conjectured by Widom that, for a generic symbol, the eigenvalues converge to the image of the symbol. In this paper we ask how the eigenvalues converge to the image. For a given Toeplitz matrix T_n(a) of size n, we take the standard approach of looking at \det(\zeta-T_n(a)), of which the asymptotic information is given by the Fisher-Hartwig theorem. For a symbol with single jump, we obtain the distribution of eigenvalues as an expansion involving 1/n and \log n/n. To demonstrate the validity of our result we compare our result against the numerics using a pure Fisher-Hartwig symbol.
