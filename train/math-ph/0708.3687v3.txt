We discuss a simple procedure for obtaining new integrable spin chains from old by replacing each single state of the original model by some collection of states. This works whenever the Lax matrix of the chain has a certain form. The simplest example is the su(n) XX model. We apply the techniques of the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz to solve such systems, in the bosonic and supersymmetric cases.
