It is usually used a complicated combinatorics to prove the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk theorem. In the present paper we give a proof of the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk theorem which use a simple combinatorics. To give this proof we interpret Feynman amplitudes as distributions on the space of \alpha-parameters.   We will use this technique in the next paper to give a proof that the divergences in nonequilibrium diagram technique can be subtracted by means the counterterms of asymptotical state.
