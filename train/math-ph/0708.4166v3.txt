In the present paper we develop the general theory of renormalization of some nonequilibrium diagram technique. This technique roughly is the Keldysh diagram technique. To develop our theory we have used the Bogoliubov -Parasiuk R - operation method. Our theory can be used for the studing of the divergences in kinetic equations.
