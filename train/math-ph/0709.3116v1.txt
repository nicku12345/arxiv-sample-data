Invariants of the coadjoint representation of two classes of Lie algebras are calculated. The first class consists of the nilpotent Lie algebras T(M), isomorphic to the algebras of upper triangular M\times M matrices. The Lie algebra T(M) is shown to have [M/2] functionally independent invariants. They can all be chosen to be polynomials and they are presented explicitly. The second class consists of the solvable Lie algebras L(M,f) with T(M) as their nilradical and f additional linearly nilindependent elements. Some general results on the invariants of L(M,f) are given and the cases M=4 for all f and f=1, or f=M-1 for all M are treated in detail.
