A method is presented for calculating the Lie point symmetries of a scalar difference equation on a two-dimensional lattice. The symmetry transformations act on the equations and on the lattice. They take solutions into solutions and can be used to perform symmetry reduction. The method generalizes one presented in a recent publication for the case of ordinary difference equations. In turn, it can easily be generalized to difference systems involving an arbitrary number of dependent and independent variables.
