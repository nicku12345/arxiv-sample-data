In the present work, we investigate the soliton structure of the Vakhnenko equation with a 'dissipative' term, by means of the Hirota's method. As a result, we unearth three kinds of soliton solutions depending upon the dissipation parameter. We further find that the scattering behavior among such structures exhibits a peculiar feature that may be the fission phenomenon.
