This review is an extended version of my mini course at the Etats de la recherche: Operateurs de Schroedinger aleatoires at the Universite Paris 13 in June 2002, a summer school organized by Frederic Klopp. These lecture notes try to give some of the basics of random Schroedinger operators. They are meant for nonspecialists and require only minor previous knowledge about functional analysis and probability theory. Nevertheless this survey includes complete proofs of Lifshitz tails and Anderson localization.
