Many different mathematical languages have been invented to describe the ideas of Einstein's special relativity. One of the most powerful languages is the Minkowski space-time algebra of D. Hestenes. We discuss the ideas of special relativity in a complex 4-dimensional algebra of observables, which is algebraically isomorphic to the even subalgebra of Hestenes' space-time algebra.
