We consider the multidimensional (nonrelativistic) Newton equation in a static electromagnetic field \ddot x = F(x,\dot x), F(x,\dot x)=-\nabla V(x)+B(x)\dot x, \dot x={dx\over dt}, x\in C^2(\R,\R^n),\eqno{(*)} where V \in C^2(\R^n,\R), B(x) is the n\times n real antisymmetric matrix with elements B_{i,k}(x), B_{i,k}\in C^1(\R^n,\R) (and B satisfies the closure condition), and |\pa^{j_1}_xV(x)| +|\pa^{j_2}_xB_{i,k}(x)| \le \beta_{|j_1|} (1+|x|)^{-(\alpha+|j_1|)} for x\in \R^n, 1\le|j_1|\le 2, 0\le|j_2|\le 1, |j_2|=|j_1|-1, i,k=1... n and some \alpha > 1. We give estimates and asymptotics for scattering solutions and scattering data for the equation (*) for the case of small angle scattering. We show that at high energies the velocity valued component of the scattering operator uniquely determines the X-ray transforms P\nabla V and PB_{i,k} (on sufficiently rich sets of straight lines). Applying results on inversion of the X-ray transform P we obtain that for n\ge 2 the velocity valued component of the scattering operator at high energies uniquely determines (\nabla V,B). We also consider the problem of recovering (\nabla V,B) from our high energies asymptotics found for the configuration valued component of the scattering operator. Results of the present work were obtained by developing the inverse scattering approach of [R. Novikov, 1999] for (*) with B\equiv 0 and of [Jollivet, 2005] for the relativistic version of (*). We emphasize that there is an interesting difference in asymptotics for scattering solutions and scattering data for (*) on the one hand and for its relativistic version on the other.
