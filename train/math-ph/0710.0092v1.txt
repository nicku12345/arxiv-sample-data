The concept of number and its generalization has played a central role in the development of mathematics over many centuries and many civilizations. Noteworthy milestones in this long and arduous process were the developments of the real and complex numbers which have achieved universal acceptance. Serious attempts have been made at further extensions, such as Hamiltons quaternions, Grassmann's exterior algebra and Clifford's geometric algebra. By examining the geometry of moving planes, we show how new mathematics is within reach, if the will to learn these powerful methods can be found.
