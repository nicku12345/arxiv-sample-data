A new method for analyzing arterial blood pressure is presented in this report. The technique is based on the scattering transform and consists in solving the spectral problem associated to a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with a potential depending linearly upon the pressure. This potential is then expressed with the discrete spectrum which includes negative eigenvalues and corresponds to the interacting components of an N-soliton. The approach is similar to a nonlinear Fourier transform where the solitons play the role of sine and cosine components. The method provides new cardiovascular indices that seem to contain relevant physiological information. We first show how to use this approach to decompose the arterial blood pressure pulse into elementary waves and to reconstruct it or to separate its systolic and diastolic phases. Then we analyse the parameters computed from this technique in two physiological conditions, the head-up 60 degrees tilt test and the isometric handgrip test, widely used for studying short term cardiovascular control. Promising results are obtained.
