In this paper we consider embedded eigenvalues of a Schroedinger Hamiltonian in a waveguide induced by a symmetric perturbation. It is shown that these eigenvalues become unstable and turn into resonances after twisting of the waveguide. The perturbative expansion of the resonance width is calculated for weakly twisted waveguides and the influence of the twist on resonances in a concrete model is discussed in detail.
