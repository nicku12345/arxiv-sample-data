A unified theory of phase transitions and quantum effects in quantum anharmonic crystals is presented. In its framework, the relationship between these two phenomena is analyzed. The theory is based on the representation of the model Gibbs states in terms of path measures (Euclidean Gibbs measures). It covers the case of crystals without translation invariance, as well as the case of asymmetric anharmonic potentials. The results obtained are compared with those known in the literature.
