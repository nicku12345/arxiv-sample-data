The notions of generating sets of conservation laws of systems of differential equations with respect to symmetry groups and equivalence groups are introduced and applied. This allows us to generalize essentially the procedure of finding potential symmetries for the systems with multidimensional spaces of conservation laws. A class of variable coefficient (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear diffusion-convection equations of general form f(x)u_t=(g(x)A(u)u_x)_x+h(x)B(u)u_x is investigated. Using the most direct method, we carry out two classifications of local conservation laws up to equivalence relations generated by both usual and enhanced equivalence groups. Equivalence with respect to \hat G^{\sim} and correct choice of gauge coefficients of equations play the major role for simple and clear formulation of the final results. The notion of contractions of conservation laws and one of characteristics of conservation laws are introduced and contractions of conservation laws of diffusion-convection equations are found.
