A new mathematical model for the description of three electron quantum dots in 2D space is created, and ground states of this system in external magnetic field is investigated. The Schrodinger equation for three two-dimensional electrons is solved by the use of the Hyperspherical Function Method (HFM) It is shown that the HFM allows us to separate the center of mass movement and solve Schrodinger Equation with the use of the logarithmic potential of electron-electron interactions. Ground state energy levels as function of the magnetic field frequency is obtained.
