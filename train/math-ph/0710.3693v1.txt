We study the ergodicity of finite-dimensional approximations of the Schr\"odinger equation. The system is driven by a multiplicative scalar noise. Under general assumptions over the distribution of the noise, we show that the system has a unique stationary measure \mu on the unit sphere S in \C^n, and \mu is absolutely continuous with respect to the Riemannian volume on S. Moreover, for any initial condition in S, the solution converges exponentially fast to the measure \mu in the variational norm.
