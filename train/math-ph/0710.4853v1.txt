The proof of the inequality \lambda_{q}(x,t)\le (q\mu_{x,t} -0^+)^{-1} [p 750, below Eq. (29)] is based on the statement that {\cal E}(x,t;s) is an entire function of s\in {\mathbb C}^M [see below Eq. (30)]. But according to Equation (9) and Lemma 1, all we know is that {\cal E}(x,t;s) is an entire function of k(s)\in {\mathbb R}^N. Nevertheless, the above inequality holds, hence the proposition 1.
