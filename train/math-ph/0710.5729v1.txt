We consider a complex version of the \vee-systems, which appeared in the theory of the WDVV equation. We show that the class of these systems is closed under the natural operations of restriction and taking the subsystems and study a special class of the \vee-systems related to generalized root systems and basic classical Lie superalgebras.
