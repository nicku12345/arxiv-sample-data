In this article, we present the derivation of the asymptotic forms of the equations corresponding to the scattering coefficients of the exterior electric and magnetic fields of an infinite grating of insulating dielectric circular cylinders for vertically polarized and obliquely incident plane electromagnetic waves. Exploiting the generalized forms of the Twersky's elementary function representations for Schloemilch series, we have deducted an Ansatz describing the behavior of the scattering coefficients of the electric and magnetic fields for obliquely incident waves when the grating spacing is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic radiation. Introducing the statement of this Ansatz into the equations of the scattering coefficients of the infinite grating at oblique incidence, and expanding the scattering coefficients in the form of an asymptotic series as a function of the ratio of the radius of the cylinders to the grating spacing, we have acquired two new infinite sets of algebraic equations associated with the scattering coefficients of the exterior electric and magnetic fields of the grating for vertically polarized and obliquely incident plane waves.
