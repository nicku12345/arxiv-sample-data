We study almost periodic orbits of quantum systems and prove that for periodic time-dependent Hamiltonians an orbit is almost periodic if, and only if, it is precompact. In the case of quasiperiodic time-dependence we present an example of a precompact orbit that is not almost periodic. Finally we discuss some simple conditions assuring dynamical stability for nonautonomous quantum system.
