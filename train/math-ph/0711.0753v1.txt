The concept of superintegrability in quantum mechanics is extended to the case of a particle with spin s=1/2 interacting with one of spin s=0. Non-trivial superintegrable systems with 8- and 9-dimensional Lie algebras of first-order integrals of motion are constructed in two- and three-dimensional spaces, respectively.
