We consider the Hamiltonian system consisting of a Klein-Gordon vector field and a particle in \R^3. The initial date of the system is a random function with a finite mean density of energy which also satisfies a Rosenblatt- or Ibragimov-type mixing condition. Moreover, initial correlation functions are translation-invariant. We study the distribution \mu_t of the solution at time t\in\R. The main result is the convergence of \mu_t to a Gaussian measure as t\to\infty, where \mu_\infty is translation-invariant.
