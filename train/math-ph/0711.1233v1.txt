We prove the analog of the Cwickel-Lieb-Rosenblum estimation for the number of negative eigenvalues of a relativistic Hamiltonian with magnetic field B\in C^\infty_{\rm{pol}}(\mathbb R^d) and an electric potential V\in L^1_{\rm{loc}}(\mathbb R^d), V_-\in L^d(\mathbb R^d)\cap L^{d/2}(\mathbb R^d). Compared to the nonrelativistic case, this estimation involves both norms of V_- in L^{d/2}(\mathbb R^d) and in L^{d}(\mathbb R^d). A direct consequence is a Lieb-Thirring inequality for the sum of powers of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues.
