We complete our previous recent review on noncommutative field theory, discussing in particular the constructive aproach to the Grosse-Wulkenhaar theory. We also suggest that by gluing together many Grosse-Wulkenhaar theories at high energy one can obtain an effective commutative field theory at lower energy.
