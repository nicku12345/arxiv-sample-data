Classical random matrix ensembles with orthogonal symmetry have the property that the joint distribution of every second eigenvalue is equal to that of a classical random matrix ensemble with symplectic symmetry. These results are shown to be the case r=1 of a family of inter-relations between eigenvalue probability density functions for generalizations of the classical random matrix ensembles referred to as \beta-ensembles. The inter-relations give that the joint distribution of every (r+1)-st eigenvalue in certain \beta-ensembles with \beta = 2/(r+1) is equal to that of another \beta-ensemble with \beta = 2(r+1). The proof requires generalizing a conditional probability density function due to Dixon and Anderson.
