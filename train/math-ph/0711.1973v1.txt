We prove the commutativity of the first two nontrivial integrals of motion for quantum spin chains with elliptic form of the exchange interaction. We also show thair linear independence for the numbers of spins larger than 4. As a byproduct, we obtained several identities between elliptic Weierstrass functions of three and four arguments.
