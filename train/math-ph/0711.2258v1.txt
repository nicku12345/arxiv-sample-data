It is widely believed that statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics requires that density operators representing quantum states be normalized. We present a description of selective measurements in terms of density operators. The description is inspired by Schwinger's Algebra of Microscopic Measurements. Density operators used are not normalized. We do not know applications of density operators requiring normalization.
