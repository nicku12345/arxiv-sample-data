Earlier two of us (J.L. and L.P.) considered a matrix model for a two-level system interacting with a n\times n reservoir and assuming that the interaction is modelled by a random matrix. We presented there a formula for the reduced density matrix in the limit n\to \infty  as well as several its properties and asymptotic forms in various regimes. In this paper we give the proofs of the assertions, and present also a new fact about the model.
