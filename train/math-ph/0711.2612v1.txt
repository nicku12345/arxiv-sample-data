Continuous limits of discrete systems with long-range interactions are considered. The map of discrete models into continuous medium models is defined. A wide class of long-range interactions that give the fractional equations in the continuous limit is discussed. The one-dimensional systems of coupled oscillators for this type of long-range interactions are considered. The discrete equations of motion are mapped into the continuum equation with the Riesz fractional derivative.
