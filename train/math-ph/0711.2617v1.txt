The mean-field limit for the dynamics of bosons with random interactions is rigorously studied. It is shown that, for interactions that are almost-surely bounded, the many-body quantum evolution can be replaced in the mean-field limit by a single particle nonlinear evolution that is described by the Hartree equation. This is an Egorov-type theorem for many-body quantum systems with random interactions.
