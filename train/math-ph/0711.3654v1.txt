We study a Hamiltonian describing a pendulum coupled with several anisochronous oscillators, devising an asymptotic expansion for the splitting (matrix) associated with a homoclinic point. This expansion consists of contributions that are manifestly exponentially small in the limit of vanishing hyperbolicity, by a shift-of-contour argument. Hence, we infer a similar upper bound on the splitting itself.
