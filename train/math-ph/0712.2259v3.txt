We describe a general framework for studying duality between different phase spaces which share the same symmetry group \mathrm{H}. Solutions corresponding to collective dynamics become dual in the sense that they are generated by the same curve in \mathrm{H}. Explicit examples of phase spaces which are dual with respect to a common non trivial coadjoint orbit \mathcal{O}_{c,0}(\mathbf{\alpha},1) \subset\mathfrak{h}^{\ast} are constructed on the cotangent bundles of the factors of a double Lie group \mathrm{H}=\mathrm{N}\Join\mathrm{N}^{\ast}. In the case \mathrm{H}=LD, the loop group of a Drinfeld double Lie group D, a hamiltonian description of Poisson-Lie T-duality for non trivial monodromies and its relation with non trivial coadjoint orbits is obtained.
