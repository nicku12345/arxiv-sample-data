The origin of deterministic diffusion is a matter of discussion. We study the asymptotic distributions of the sums y_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\psi (x+k\alpha), where \psi is a periodic function of bounded variation and \alpha an irrational number. It is known that no diffusion process will be observed. Nevertheless, we find a picewise constant function \psi and an increasing sequence of integer (n_j)_j such that the limit distribution of the sequence (y_{n_j}/\sqrt j)_j is Gaussian (with stricly positive variance). If \alpha is of constant type, we show that the sequence (n_j)_j may be taken to grow exponentially (this is close to optimal in some sense, and one has ||y_{n_j}||_{\mathrm L^2}\sim \max_{0\le k\le n_j}||y_k||_{\mathrm L^2} as j\to\infty). We give an heuristic link with the theory of expanding maps of the interval.
