In this paper we consider the 14 moments model of Extended Thermodynamics for dense gases and macromolecular fluids. Solutions of the restrictions imposed by the entropy principle and that of Galilean relativity for such a model have been until now obtained in literature only in an approximate manner up to a certain order with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium; for more restrictive models they have been obtained up to whatever order, but by using Taylor expansions around equilibrium and without proving convergence. Here we have found an exact solution without using expansions. The idea has been to write firstly a relativistic model, for which it is easy to impose the Einsteinian relativity principle, and then taking its non relativistic limit.
