We prove the existence and uniqueness of stationary spherically symmetric positive solutions for the Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton model in any space dimension d. Our result is based on an analysis of the corresponding system of second order differential equations. It turns out that d=6 is critical for the existence of finite energy solutions and the equations for positive spherically symmetric solutions reduce to a Lane-Emden equation for all d\geq 6. Our result implies in particular the existence of stationary solutions for two-dimensional self-gravitating particles and closes the gap between the variational proofs in d=1 and d=3.
