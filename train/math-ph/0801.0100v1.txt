Recent applications in queuing theory and statistical mechanics have isolated the process formed by the eigenvalues of successive minors of the GUE. Analogous eigenvalue processes, formed in general from the eigenvalues of nested sequences of matrices resulting from random corank 1 projections of classical random matrix ensembles, are identified for the LUE and JUE. The correlations for all these processes can be computed in a unified way. The resulting expressions can then be analyzed in various scaling limits. At the soft edge, with the rank of the minors differing by an amount proportional to N^{2/3}, the scaled correlations coincide with those known from the soft edge scaling of the Dyson Brownian motion model.
