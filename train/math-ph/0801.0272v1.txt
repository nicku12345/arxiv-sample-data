We analytically evaluate a dilogarithmic integral that is prototypical of volumes of ideal tetrahedra in hyperbolic geometry. We additionally obtain new representations of the Clausen function Cl_2 and the Catalan constant G=Cl_2(\pi/2), as well as new relations between sine and Clausen function values.
