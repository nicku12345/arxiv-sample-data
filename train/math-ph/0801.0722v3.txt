We study a quantum dynamical semigroup driven by a Lindblad generator with a deterministic Schr\"odinger part and a noisy Poission-timed scattering part. The dynamics describes the evolution of a test particle in \R^{n}, n=1,2,3, immersed in a gas, and the noisy scattering part is defined by the reduced effect of an individual interaction, where the interaction between the test particle and a single gas particle is via a repulsive point potential. In the limit that the mass ratio \lambda=\frac{m}{M} tends to zero and the collisions become more frequent as \frac{1}{\lambda}, we show that our dynamics \Phi_{t,\lambda} approaches a limiting dynamics \Phi_{t,\lambda}^{\diamond} with second order error. Working in the Heisenberg representation, for G\in \Bi(L^{2}(\R^{n})) n=1,3 we bound the difference between \Phi_{t,\lambda}(G) and \Phi_{t,\lambda}^{\diamond}(G) in operator norm proportional to \lambda^{2}.
