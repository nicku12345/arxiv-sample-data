In this paper we derive an expression for the dynamic electric polarizability of a particle bound by a double delta potential for frequencies below and above the absolute value of the particle's ground state energy. The derived expression will be used to study some of the fundamental features of the system and its representation of real systems. In addition we derive a general expression of the dynamic electric polarizability for a potential of multi-delta functions.
