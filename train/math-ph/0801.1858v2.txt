This is a review of the Riemann-Hilbert approach to the large N asymptotics in random matrix models and its applications. We discuss the following topics: random matrix models and orthogonal polynomials, the Riemann-Hilbert approach to the large N asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials and its applications to the problem of universality in random matrix models, the double scaling limits, the large N asymptotics of the partition function, and random matrix models with external source.
