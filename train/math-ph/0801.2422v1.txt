We consider the method of topological quantization for conservative systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Maupertuis' formalism for classical mechanics provides an appropriate scenario which permit us to adapt the method of topological quantization, originally formulated for gravitational field configurations. We show that any conservative system in classical mechanics can be associated with a principal fiber bundle. As an application of topological quantization we derive expressions for the topological spectra of some simple mechanical systems and show that they reproduce the discrete behavior of the corresponding canonical spectra.
