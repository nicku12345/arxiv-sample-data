An one-dimensional Kohn-Sham system for spin particles is considered which effectively describes semiconductor {nano}structures and which is investigated at zero temperature. We prove the existence of solutions and derive a priori estimates. For this purpose we find estimates for eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator with effective Kohn-Sham potential and obtain W^{1,2}-bounds of the associated particle density operator. Afterwards, compactness and continuity results allow to apply Schauder's fixed point theorem. In case of vanishing exchange-correlation potential uniqueness is shown by monotonicity arguments. Finally, we investigate the behavior of the system if the temperature approaches zero.
