We attempt to prove the existence of Reeh-Schlieder states on curved spacetimes in the framework of locally covariant quantum field theory using the idea of spacetime deformation and assuming the existence of a Reeh-Schlieder state on a diffeomorphic (but not isometric) spacetime. We find that physically interesting states with a weak form of the Reeh-Schlieder property always exist and indicate their usefulness. Algebraic states satisfying the full Reeh-Schlieder property also exist, but are not guaranteed to be of physical interest.
