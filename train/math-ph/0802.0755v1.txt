We consider an invariant quantum Hamiltonian H=-\Delta_{LB}+V in the L^{2} space based on a Riemannian manifold \tilde{M} with a discrete symmetry group \Gamma. Typically, \tilde{M} is the universal covering space of a multiply connected manifold M and \Gamma is the fundamental group of M. To any unitary representation \Lambda of \Gamma one can relate another operator on M=\tilde{M}/\Gamma, called H_\Lambda, which formally corresponds to the same differential operator as H but which is determined by quasi-periodic boundary conditions. We give a brief review of the Bloch decomposition of H and of a formula relating the propagators associated to the Hamiltonians H_\Lambda and H. Then we concentrate on the example of the Aharonov-Bohm effect with two vortices. We explain in detail the construction of the propagator in this case and indicate all essential intermediate steps.
