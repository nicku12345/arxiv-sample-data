We show how partner symmetries of the elliptic and hyperbolic complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations (CMA and HCMA) provide a lift of non-invariant solutions of three- and two-dimensional reduced equations, i.e., a lift of invariant solutions of the original CMA and HCMA equations, to non-invariant solutions of the latter four-dimensional equations. The lift is applied to non-invariant solutions of the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation to yield non-invariant solutions of CMA, and to non-invariant solutions of three-dimensional wave equation and three-dimensional hyperbolic Boyer-Finley equation to yield non-invariant solutions of HCMA. By using these solutions as metric potentials, it is possible to construct four-dimensional Ricci-flat metrics of Euclidean and ultra-hyperbolic signatures that have non-zero curvature tensors and no Killing vectors.
