We review some basic theorems on integrability of Hamiltonian systems, namely the Liouville-Arnold theorem on complete integrability, the Nekhoroshev theorem on partial integrability and the Mishchenko-Fomenko theorem on noncommutative integrability, and for each of them we give a version suitable for the noncompact case. We give a possible global version of the previous local results, under certain topological hypotheses on the base space. It turns out that locally affine structures arise naturally in this setting.
