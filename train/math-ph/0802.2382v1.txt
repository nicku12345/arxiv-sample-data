The Higgs mechanism of mass generation is the main ingredient in the contemporary Standard Model and its various generalizations. However, there is no comprehensive theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We summarize the relevant mathematical results characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena in algebraic quantum theory, axiomatic quantum field theory, group theory, and classical gauge theory.
