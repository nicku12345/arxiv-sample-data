Parametrization of 4\times 4-matrices G of the complex linear group GL(4,C) in terms of four complex 4-vector parameters (k,m,n,l) is investigated. Additional restrictions separating some subgroups of GL(4,C) are given explicitly. In the given parametrization, the problem of inverting any 4\times 4 matrix G is solved. Expression for determinant of any matrix G is found: \det G = F(k,m,n,l). Unitarity conditions G^{+} = G^{-1} have been formulated in the form of non-linear cubic algebraic equations including complex conjugation. Several simplest solutions of these unitarity equations have been found: three 2-parametric subgroups G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3} - each of subgroups consists of two commuting Abelian unitary groups; 4-parametric unitary subgroup consisting of a product of a 3-parametric group isomorphic SU(2) and 1-parametric Abelian group. The Dirac basis of generators \Lambda_{k}, being of Gell-Mann type, substantially differs from the basis \lambda_{i} used in the literature on SU(4) group, formulas relating them are found - they permit to separate SU(3) subgroup in SU(4). Special way to list 15 Dirac generators of GL(4,C) can be used \{\Lambda_k\} = \{\alpha_i\oplus\beta_j\oplus(\alpha_iV\beta_j = {\boldsymbol K} \oplus {\boldsymbol L}\oplus{\boldsymbol M})\}, which permit to factorize SU(4) transformations according to S = e^{i\vec{a}\vec{\alpha}} e^{i\vec{b}\vec\beta}} e^{i{\boldsymbol k}{\boldsymbol K}} e^{i{\boldsymbol l}{\boldsymbol L}} e^{i\boldsymbol m}{\boldsymbol M}}, where two first factors commute with each other and are isomorphic to SU(2) group, the three last ones are 3-parametric groups, each of them consisting of three Abelian commuting unitary subgroups.
