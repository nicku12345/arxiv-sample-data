Discussed are quantized dynamical systems on orthogonal and affine groups. The special stress is laid on geodetic systems with affinely-invariant kinetic energy operators. The resulting formulas show that such models may be useful in nuclear and hadronic dynamics. They differ from traditional Bohr-Mottelson models where SL(n,\mathbb{R}) is used as a so-called non-invariance group. There is an interesting relationship between classical and quantized integrable lattices.
