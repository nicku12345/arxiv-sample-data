We study wave propagation in periodic and frequency dependent materials. The approach in this paper leads to spectral analysis of a quadratic operator pencil where the spectral parameter relates to the quasimomentum and the frequency is a parameter. We show that the underlying operator has a discrete spectrum, where the eigenvalues are symmetrically placed with respect to the real and imaginary axis. Moreover, we discretize the operator pencil with finite elements and use a Krylov space method to compute eigenvalues of the resulting large sparse matrix pencil.
