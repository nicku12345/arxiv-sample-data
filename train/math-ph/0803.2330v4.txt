In this paper we proposed a proposition: for any nonconservative classical mechanical system and any initial condition, there exists a conservative one; the two systems share one and only one common phase curve; the Hamiltonian of the conservative system is the sum of the total energy of the nonconservative system on the aforementioned phase curve and a constant depending on the initial condition. Hence, this approach entails substituting an infinite number of conservative systems for a dissipative mechanical system corresponding to varied initial conditions. One key way we use to demonstrate these viewpoints is that by the Newton-Laplace principle the nonconservative force can be reasonably assumed to be equal to a function of a component of generalized coordinates q_i along a phase curve, such that a nonconservative mechanical system can be reformulated as countless conservative systems. Utilizing the proposition, one can apply the method of Hamiltonian mechanics or Lagrangian mechanics to dissipative mechanical system. The advantage of this approach is that there is no need to change the definition of canonical momentum and the motion is identical to that of the original system.
