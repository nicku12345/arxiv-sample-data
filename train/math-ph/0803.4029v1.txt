We study the size effect on the energy levels of the D-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator confined within a box of radius r_c with impenetrable walls. Two different approaches are used to obtain the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for D=1,2,...,5. In the first we solve the Schroedinger equation exactly. In the second we use a series expansion of the wave function. The numerical results obtained are extremely accurate; these values are reported with 50 decimal places.
