The velocity field and the associated tangential stress corresponding to flow of a generalized second grade fluid between two infinite coaxial circular cylinders, are determined by means of the Laplace and Hankel transforms. At time t=0 the fluid is at rest and at t=0^+ cylinders suddenly begin to rotate about their common axis with a constant angular acceleration. The solutions that have been obtained satisfy the governing differential equations and all imposed initial and boundary conditions. The similar solutions for a second grade fluid and Newtonian fluid are recovered from our general solutions. The influence of the fractional coefficient on the velocity of the fluid is also analyzed by graphical illustrations.
