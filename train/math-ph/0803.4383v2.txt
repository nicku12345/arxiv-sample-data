We develop a general technique for proving convergence of repeated quantum interactions to the solution of a quantum stochastic differential equation. The wide applicability of the method is illustrated in a variety of examples. Our main theorem, which is based on the Trotter-Kato theorem, is not restricted to a specific noise model and does not require boundedness of the limit coefficients.
