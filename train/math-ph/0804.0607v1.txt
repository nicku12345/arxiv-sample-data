Chains with long-range interactions are considered. The interactions are defined such that each nth particle interacts only with chain particles with the numbers n+a(m) and n-a(m), where m=1,2,3,... and a(m) is an integer-valued function. Exponential type functions a(m)=b^m, where b=2,3,.., are discussed. The correspondent pseudodifferential equations of chain oscillations are obtained. Dispersion laws of the suggested chains are described by the Weierstrass and Weierstrass-Mandelbrot functions.
