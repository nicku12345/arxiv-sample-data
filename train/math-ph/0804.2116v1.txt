We consider the deformed Gaussian Ensemble H_n=M_n+H^{(0)}_n in which H_n^{(0)} is a diagonal Hermitian matrix and M_n is the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) random matrix. Assuming that the Normalized Counting Measure of H_n^{(0)} (both non-random and random) converges weakly to a measure N^{(0)} with a bounded support we prove universality of the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk of the limiting spectrum of H_n.
