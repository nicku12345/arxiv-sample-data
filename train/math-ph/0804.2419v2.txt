We consider the problem of computation of the correlation functions for the z-measures with the deformation (Jack) parameters 2 or 1/2. Such measures on partitions are originated from the representation theory of the infinite symmetric group, and in many ways are similar to the ensembles of Random Matrix Theory of \beta=4 or \beta=1 symmetry types. For a certain class of such measures we show that correlation functions can be represented as Pfaffians including 2\times 2 matrix valued kernels, and compute these kernels explicitly. We also give contour integral representations for correlation kernels of closely connected measures on partitions.
