A space of local martingales of SLE type growth processes forms a representation of Virasoro algebra, but apart from a few simplest cases not much is known about this representation. The purpose of this article is to exhibit examples of representations where L_0 is not diagonalizable - a phenomenon characteristic of logarithmic conformal field theory. Furthermore, we observe that the local martingales bear a close relation with the fusion product of the boundary changing fields.   Our examples reproduce first of all many familiar logarithmic representations at certain rational values of the central charge. In particular we discuss the case of SLE(kappa=6) describing the exploration path in critical percolation, and its relation with the question of operator content of the appropriate conformal field theory of zero central charge. In this case one encounters logarithms in a probabilistically transparent way, through conditioning on a crossing event. But we also observe that some quite natural SLE variants exhibit logarithmic behavior at all values of kappa, thus at all central charges and not only at specific rational values.
