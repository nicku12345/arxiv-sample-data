We use Hamilton-Jacobi theory to construct a gauge-invariant zero-energy candidate ground state for canonically quantized Yang-Mills theory with a "nonlinear normal" factor ordering, generalizing an analogous ordering introduced by Moncrief and Ryan for problems with finitely many degrees of freedom. Invariance under spatial rotations and translations is immediate; boost invariance remains under investigation. The motivation is to find a model for constructing a candidate ground state in general relativity, canonically quantized a la the Ashtekar variables. We seek to avoid replicating some of the more troublesome features of the Kodama state, inherited from the Chern-Simons state.
