Consider the 3D Anderson model with a zero mean and bounded i.i.d. random potential. Let \lambda be the coupling constant measuring the strength of the disorder, and \sigma(E) the self energy of the model at energy E. For any \epsilon>0 and sufficiently small \lambda, we derive almost sure localization in the band E \le -\sigma(0)-\lambda^{4-\epsilon}. In this energy region, we show that the typical correlation length \xi_E behaves roughly as O((|E|-\sigma(E))^{-1/2}), completing the argument outlined in the unpublished work of T. Spencer.
