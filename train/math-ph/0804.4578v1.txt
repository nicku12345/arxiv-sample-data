Consider in L^2(\R) the \Sc operator family H(g):=-d^2_x+V_g(x) depending on the real parameter g, where V_g(x) is a complex-valued but PT symmetric periodic potential. An explicit condition on V is obtained which ensures that the spectrum of H(g) is purely real and band shaped; furthermore, a further condition is obtained which ensures that the spectrum contains at least a pair of complex analytic arcs.
