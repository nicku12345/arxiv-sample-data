In 1970 Baxter considered the statistical three-coloring lattice model for the case of toroidal boundary conditions. He used the Bethe ansatz and found the partition function of the model in the thermodynamic limit. We consider the same model but use other boundary conditions for which one can prove that the partition function satisfies some functional equations similar to the functional equations satisfied by the partition function of the six-vertex model for a special value of the crossing parameter.
