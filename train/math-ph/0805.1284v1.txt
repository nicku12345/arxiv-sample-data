A model operator H associated to a system describing four particles in interaction, without conservation of the number of particles, is considered. We describe the essential spectrum of H by the spectrum of the channel operators and prove the Hunziker-van Winter-Zhislin (HWZ) theorem for the operator H. We also give some variational principles for boundaries of the essential spectrum and interior eigenvalues.
