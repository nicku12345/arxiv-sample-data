A wide range of new Q-conditional symmetries for reaction-diffusion systems with power diffusivities are constructed. The relevant non-Lie ansatze to reduce the reaction-diffusion systems to ODE systems and examples of exact solutions are obtained. The relation of the solutions obtained with the development of spatially inhomogeneous structures is discussed.
