The energy representation of a gauge group on a Riemannian manifold has been discussed by several authors. Y. Shimada has shown the irreducibility for compact Riemannian manifold, using white noise analysis. In this paper we extend its technique to noncompact Riemannian manifolds which have differential operators satisfying some conditions.
