Starting with Einstein's theory of special relativity and the principle that whenever a celestial body or an elementary particle, subjected only to the fundamental forces of nature, undergoes a change in its kinetic energy then the mass-energy equivalent of that kinetic energy must be subtracted from the rest-mass of the body or particle, we derive explicit equations of motion for two falling bodies. In the resulting mathematical theory we find that there are no singularities and consequently no blackholes.
