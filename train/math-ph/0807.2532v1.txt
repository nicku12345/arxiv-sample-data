Continuous symmetries generated with observables of a quantum theory in the Minkowski spacetime are discussed. An example of an originated in this way algebra of observables is the algebra of observables of the canonical quantum theory, that is contained the Lorentz group algebra and the Heisenberg algebra of phase space operators. In the general case commutation relations between observables depend on c, h and additional fundamental constants. Free field equations are considered, which are invariant with respect to generalized kinematical symmetries of the quantum phase space.
