Let u(x,t) be a (possibly weak) solution of the Navier - Stokes equations on all of {\mathbb R}^3, or on the torus {\mathbb R}^3/ {\mathbb Z}^3. The {\it energy spectrum} of u(\cdot,t) is the spherical integral \[   E(\kappa,t) = \int_{|k| = \kappa} |\hat{u}(k,t)|^2 dS(k), \qquad   0 \leq \kappa < \infty, \] or alternatively, a suitable approximate sum. An argument involking scale invariance and dimensional analysis given by Kolmogorov (1941) and Obukhov (1941) predicts that large Reynolds number solutions of the Navier - Stokes equations in three dimensions should obey \[   E(\kappa, t) \sim C_0\varepsilon^{2/3}\kappa^{-5/3} \] over an inertial range \kappa_1 \leq \kappa \leq \kappa_2, at least in an average sense. We give a global estimate on weak solutions in the norm   \|{\mathcal F}\partial_x u(\cdot, t)\|_\infty which gives bounds on a solution's ability to satisfy the Kolmogorov law. A subsequent result is for rigorous upper and lower bounds on the inertial range, and an upper bound on the time of validity of the Kolmogorov spectral regime.
