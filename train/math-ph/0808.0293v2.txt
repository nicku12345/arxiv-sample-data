We continue the study of the free energy of quantum lattice spin systems where to the local Hamiltonian H an arbitrary mean field term is added, a polynomial function of the arithmetic mean of some local observables X and Y that do not necessarily commute. By slightly extending a recent paper by Hiai, Mosonyi, Ohno and Petz [9], we prove in general that the free energy is given by a variational principle over the range of the operators X and Y. As in [9], the result is a noncommutative extension of the Laplace-Varadhan asymptotic formula.
