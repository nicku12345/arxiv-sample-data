We deal with the gap function and the thermodynamical potential in the BCS-Bogoliubov theory of superconductivity, where the gap function is a function of the temperature T only. We show that the squared gap function is of class C^2 on the closed interval [ 0, T_c ] and point out some more properties of the gap function. Here, T_c stands for the transition temperature. On the basis of this study we then give, examining the thermodynamical potential, a mathematical proof that the transition to a superconducting state is a second-order phase transition. Furthermore, we obtain a new and more precise form of the gap in the specific heat at constant volume from a mathematical point of view.
