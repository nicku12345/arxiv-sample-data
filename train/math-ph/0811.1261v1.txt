In this paper, we correct an inaccurate result of previous works on the Feynman propagator in position space of a free Dirac field in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime, and we derive the generalized analytic formulas of both the scalar Feynman propagator and the spinor Feynman propagator in position space in arbitrary (D+1)-dimensional spacetime, and we further find a recurrence relation among the spinor Feynman propagator in (D+1)-dimensional spacetime and the scalar Feynman propagators in (D+1)-, (D-1)- and (D+3)-dimensional spacetimes.
