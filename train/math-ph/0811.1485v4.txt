We construct a noncommutative geometry with generalised `tangent bundle' from Fell bundle C^*-categories (E) beginning by replacing pair groupoid objects (points) with objects in E. This provides a categorification of a certain class of real spectral triples where the Dirac operator is constructed from morphisms in a category. Applications for physics include quantisation via the tangent groupoid and new constraints on D_{\mathrm{finite}} (the fermion mass matrix).
