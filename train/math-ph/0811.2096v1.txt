The Klein-Gordon equation is solved approximately for the Hulth\'{e}n potential for any angular momentum quantum number \ell with the position-dependent mass. Solutions are obtained reducing the Klein-Gordon equation into a Schr\"{o}dinger-like differential equation by using an appropriate coordinate transformation. The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used in the calculations to get an energy eigenvalue and and the wave functions. It is found that the results in the case of constant mass are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the literature.
