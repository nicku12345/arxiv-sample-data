An approximate solution of the D-dimensional Schr\ddot{o}dinger equation with the modified P\ddot{o}schl-Teller potential is obtained with an approximation of the centrifugal term. Solution to the corresponding hyper-radial equation is given using the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The normalization constants for the P\ddot{o}schl-Teller potential are also computed. The expectation values <r^{-2}>,<V(r)>, are also obtained using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem.
