Electroweak unification is implied by the local structure theorem of distribution theory applied to the causal interval R=X-Z between two space-time points X and Z. Taking R as generating function, the potentials of the electromagnetic and weak interactions are obtained by applying the causal d'Alembertian operator on R, and both potentials can be given a proper physical interpretation provided all calculations are made in the context of nonlinear generalized functions.
