We prove that the resonance counting functions for Schr\"odinger operators H_V = - \Delta + V on L^2 (\R^d), for d \geq 2 {\it even}, with generic, compactly-supported, real- or complex-valued potentials V, have the maximal order of growth d on each sheet \Lambda_m, m \in \Z \backslash \{0 \}, of the logarithmic Riemann surface. We obtain this result by constructing, for each m \in \Z \backslash \{0 \}, a plurisubharmonic function from a scattering determinant whose zeros on the physical sheet \Lambda_0 determine the poles on \Lambda_m. We prove that the order of growth of the counting function is related to a suitable estimate on this function that we establish for generic potentials. We also show that for a potential that is the characteristic function of a ball, the resonance counting function is bounded below by C_m r^d on each sheet \Lambda_m, m \in \Z \backslash \{0\}.
