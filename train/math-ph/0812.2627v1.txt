We analyse a two-particle quantum system in \R^d with interaction and in presence of a random external potential field with a continuous argument (an Anderson model in a continuous space). Our aim is to establish the so-called Wegner-type estimates for such a model, assessing the probability that random spectra of Hamiltonians in finite volumes intersect with a given set. For the lattice version of the two-particle model, a similar result was obtained in [8]
