These classical inequalities allow one to estimate the number of negative eigenvalues and the sums S_{\gamma}=\sum |\lambda_i|^{\gamma} for a wide class of Schr\"{o}dinger operators. We provide a detailed proof of these inequalities for operators on functions in metric spaces using the classical Lieb approach based on the Kac-Feynman formula. The main goal of the paper is a new set of examples which include perturbations of the Anderson operator, operators on free, nilpotent and solvable groups, operators on quantum graphs, Markov processes with independent increments. The study of the examples requires an exact estimate of the kernel of the corresponding parabolic semigroup on the diagonal. In some cases the kernel decays exponentially as t\to \infty . This allows us to consider very slow decaying potentials and obtain some results that are precise in the logarithmical scale.
