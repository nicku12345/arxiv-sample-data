We consider a non-relativistic electron interacting with a classical magnetic field pointing along the x_3-axis and with a quantized electromagnetic field. The system is translation invariant in the x_3-direction and we consider the reduced Hamiltonian H(P_3) associated with the total momentum P_3 along the x_3-axis. For a fixed momentum P_3 sufficiently small, we prove that H(P_3) has a ground state in the Fock representation if and only if E'(P_3)=0, where P_3 \mapsto E'(P_3) is the derivative of the map P_3 \mapsto E(P_3) = \inf \sigma (H(P_3)). If E'(P_3) \neq 0, we obtain the existence of a ground state in a non-Fock representation. This result holds for sufficiently small values of the coupling constant.
