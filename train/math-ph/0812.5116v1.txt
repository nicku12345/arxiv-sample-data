This work is an extended version of the paper arXiv:0803.2669v1[math-ph], in which the main results were announced. We consider certain classical diffusion process for a wave function on the phase space. It is shown that at the time of order 10^{-11} {\it sec} this process converges to a process considered by quantum mechanics and described by the Schrodinger equation. This model studies the probability distributions in the phase space corresponding to the wave functions of quantum mechanics. We estimate the parameters of the model using the Lamb--Retherford experimental data on shift in the spectrum of hydrogen atom and the assumption on the heat reason of the considered diffusion process.   In the paper it is shown that the quantum mechanical description of the processes can arise as an approximate description of more exact models. For the model considered in this paper, this approximation arises when the Hamilton function changes slowly under deviations of coordinates, momenta, and time on intervals whose length is of order determined by the Planck constant and by the diffusion intensities.
