In this paper, we study the global in time existence problem for the Groma-Balogh model describing the dynamics of dislocation densities. This model is a two-dimensional model where the dislocation densities satisfy a system of transport equations such that the velocity vector field is the shear stress in the material, solving the equations of elasticity. This shear stress can be expressed as some Riesz transform of the dislocation densities. The main tool in the proof of this result is the existence of an entropy for this system
