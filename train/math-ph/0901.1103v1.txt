We describe the generic behavior of the resonance counting function for a Schr\"odinger operator with a bounded, compactly-supported real or complex valued potential in d \geq 1 dimensions. This note contains a sketch of the proof of our main results \cite{ch-hi1,ch-hi2} that generically the order of growth of the resonance counting function is the maximal value d in the odd dimensional case, and that it is the maximal value d on each nonphysical sheet of the logarithmic Riemann surface in the even dimensional case. We include a review of previous results concerning the resonance counting functions for Schr\"odinger operators with compactly-supported potentials.
