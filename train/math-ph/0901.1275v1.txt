We discuss the relevance to deformation quantization of Feichtinger's modulation spaces, especially of the weighted Sjoestrand classes. These function spaces are good classes of symbols of pseudo-differential operators (observables). They have a widespread use in time-frequency analysis and related topics, but are not very well-known in physics. It turns out that they are particularly well adapted to the study of the Moyal star-product and of the star-exponential.
