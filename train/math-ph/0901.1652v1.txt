We study a lattice field model which qualitatively reflects the phenomenon of Anderson localization and delocalization for real symmetric band matrices. In this statistical mechanics model, the field takes values in a supermanifold based on the hyperbolic plane. Correlations in this model may be described in terms of a random walk in a highly correlated random environment. We prove that in three or more dimensions the model has a `diffusive' phase at low temperatures. Localization is expected at high temperatures. Our analysis uses estimates on non-uniformly elliptic Green's functions and a family of Ward identities coming from internal supersymmetry.
