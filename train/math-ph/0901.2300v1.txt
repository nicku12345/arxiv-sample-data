The paper extends existing Lie algebra representation theory related to Lie algebra gradings. The notion of a representation compatible with a given grading is defined and applied to finite-dimensional representations of sl(n,\mathbb{C}) in relation with its \mathbb{Z}_2-gradings. For representation theory of sl(n,\mathbb{C}) the Gel'fand-Tseitlin method turned out very effective.
