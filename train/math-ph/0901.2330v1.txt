In this paper, starting from the microscopic dynamics of isolated dislocations, we explain how to derive formally mean field models for the dynamics of dislocation densities. Essentially these models are tranport equations, coupled with the equations of elasticity. Rigorous results of existence of solutions are presented for some of these models and the main ideas of the proofs are given.
