The radial part of Klein-Gordon equation is solved for the Woods-Saxon potential within the framework of an approximation to the centrifugal barrier. The bound states and the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions of the Woods-Saxon potential are computed by using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The results are consistent with the ones obtained in the case of generalized Woods-Saxon potential. The solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation by using the same approximation are also studied as a special case, and obtained the consistent results with the ones obtained before.
