In this paper, we obtain some new explicit travelling wave solutions of the perturbed KdV equation through recent factorization techniques that can be performed when the coefficients of the equation fulfill a certain condition. The solutions are obtained by using a two-step factorization procedure through which the perturbed KdV equation is reduced to a nonlinear second order differential equation, and to some Bernoulli and Abel type differential equations whose solutions are expressed in terms of the exponential and Weierstrass functions
