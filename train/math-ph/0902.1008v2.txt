Referring to quantum mechanics, Einstein used to say "The old one does not play dice." And this is true since the probability of quantum mechanics is not the classical probability of games such as dice. Historically this was the first example of a non-classical probability theory, which we introduce in this expository article using undergraduate linear algebra. There is a short appendix on qubits. Knowledge of quantum mechanics is not required.
