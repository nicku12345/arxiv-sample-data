The two-dimensional relativistic configurational \vec r-space is proposed and the exactly solvable finite-difference model of the harmonic oscillator in this space is constructed. The wave functions of the stationary states and the corresponding energy spectrum are found for the model under consideration. It is shown that, they have correct non-relativistic limit. Explicit form of the plane momentum operator is determined.
