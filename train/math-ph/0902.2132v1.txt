We use the geometric approach to the theory of Lie systems of differential equations in order to study dissipative Ermakov systems. We prove that there is a superposition rule for solutions of such equations. This fact enables us to express the general solution of a dissipative Milne--Pinney equation in terms of particular solutions of a system of second-order linear differential equations and a set of constants.
