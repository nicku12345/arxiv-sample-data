A complete description of Q-conditional symmetries of reaction-diffusion-convection equation with arbitrary power nonlinearities is finished. It is shown that the results obtained in the first and second parts of this work (see arXiv:math-ph/0612078 and arXiv:0706.0814) cannot be extended on new power nonlinearities arising in the diffusion and convection coefficients.
