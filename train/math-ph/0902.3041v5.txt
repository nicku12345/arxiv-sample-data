Trough the systematic use of the Minlos theorem on the support of cylindrical measures on R infinity, we produce several mathematically rigorous path integrals in interacting euclidean quantum fields with Gaussian free measures defined by generalizeds powers of the laplacean operator on finite volume space-times
