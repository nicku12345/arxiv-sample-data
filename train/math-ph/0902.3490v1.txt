We give an overview of recent advances in analysis of equations of electrodynamics with the aid of biquaternionic technique. We discuss both models with constant and variable coefficients, integral representations of solutions, a numerical method based on biquaternionic fundamental solutions for solving standard electromagnetic scattering problems, relations between different operators of mathematical physics including the Schrodinger, the Maxwell system, the conductivity equation and others leading to a deeper understanding of physics and mathematical properties of the equations.
