Rates of convergence of solutions of various two-dimensional \alpha-regularization models, subject to periodic boundary conditions, toward solutions of the exact Navier-Stokes equations are given in the L^\infty-L^2 time-space norm, in terms of the regularization parameter  \alpha, when \alpha approaches zero. Furthermore, as a paradigm, error estimates for the Galerkin approximation of the exact two-dimensional Leray-\alpha model are also presented in the L^\infty-L^2 time-space norm. Simply by the triangle inequality, one can reach the error estimates of the solutions of Galerkin approximation of the \alpha-regularization models toward the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the two-dimensional periodic boundary conditions case.
