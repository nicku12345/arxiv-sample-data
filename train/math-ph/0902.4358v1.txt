We discuss various scattering properties of non-topological solitons, Q-balls, on potential obstructions in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions. These obstructions, barriers and holes, are inserted into the potential of the theory via the coupling parameter, ie \tilde\lambda, that is effective only in a certain region of space. When \tilde\lambda > 1 the obstruction is a barrier and when 0 < \tilde\lambda < 1 the obstruction is a hole. The dynamics of Q-balls on such obstructions in (1+1) dimensions is shown to be very similar to that of topological solitons provided that the Q-balls are stable.   In (2+1) dimensions, numerical simulations have shown some differences from the dynamics of topological solitons. We discuss these differences in some detail.
