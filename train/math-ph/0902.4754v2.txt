We review in detail the Hamiltonian dynamics for constrained systems. Emphasis is put on the total Hamiltonian system rather than on the extended Hamiltonian system. We provide a systematic analysis of (global and local) symmetries in total Hamiltonian systems. In particular, in analogue to total Hamiltonians, we introduce the notion of total Noether charges. Grassmannian degrees of freedom are also addressed in details.
