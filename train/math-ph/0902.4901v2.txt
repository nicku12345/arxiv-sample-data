In this work we formulate a generalized theoretical model to describe the nonlinear dynamics observed in combined frequency-amplitude modulators whose characteristic parameters exhibit a nonlinear dependence on the input modulating signal. The derived analytical solution may give a satisfactory explanation of recent laboratory observations on magnetic spin-transfer oscillators and fully agrees with results of micromagnetic calculations. Since the theory has been developed independently of the mechanism causing the nonlinearities, it may encompass the description of modulation processes of any physical nature, a promising feature for potential applications in the field of communication systems.
