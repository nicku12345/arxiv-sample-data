The pair-specific ground state energy of Newtonian N-body systems grows monotonically in N. This furnishes a whole family of simple new tests for minimality of putative ground state energies obtained through computer experiments. Inspection of several publically available lists of such computer-experimentally obtained putative ground state energies has yielded several dozen instances which failed (at least) one of these tests. Although the correct ground state energy is not revealed by this method, it does yield a better upper bound on it than the experimentally found value whenever the latter fails a monotonicity test. The surveyed N-body systems include in particular N point charges with 2- or 3-dimensional Coulomb pair interactions, placed either on the unit 2-sphere or on a 2-torus (a.k.a. Thomson, Fekete, or Riesz problems).
