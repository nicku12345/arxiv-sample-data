This is the first part of a work aimed at constructing the stress-energy tensor of conformal field theory as a local "object" in conformal loop ensembles (CLE). This work lies in the wider context of re-constructing quantum field theory from mathematically well-defined ensembles of random objects. The goal of the present paper is two-fold. First, we provide an introduction to CLE, a mathematical theory for random loops in simply connected domains with properties of conformal invariance, developed recently by Sheffield and Werner. It is expected to be related to CFT models with central charges between 0 and 1 (including all minimal models). Second, we further develop the theory by deriving results that will be crucial for the construction of the stress-energy tensor. We introduce the notions of support and continuity of CLE events, about which we prove basic but important theorems. We then propose natural definitions of CLE probability functions on the Riemann sphere and on doubly connected domains. Under some natural assumptions, we prove conformal invariance and other non-trivial theorems related to these constructions. We only use the defining properties of CLE as well as some basic results about the CLE measure. Although this paper is guided by the construction of the stress-energy tensor, we believe that the theorems proved and techniques used are of interest in the wider context of CLE. The actual construction will be presented in the second part of this work.
