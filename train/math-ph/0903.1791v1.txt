The k-symplectic formulation of field theories is especially simple, since only tangent and cotangent bundles are needed in its description. Its defining elements show a close relationship with those in the symplectic formulation of mechanics. It will be shown that this relationship also stands in the presymplectic case. In a natural way, one can mimick the presymplectic constraint algorithm to obtain a constraint algorithm that can be applied to k-presymplectic field theory, and more particularly to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of field theories defined by a singular Lagrangian, as well as to the unified Lagrangian-Hamiltonian formalism (Skinner--Rusk formalism) for k-presymplectic field theory. Two examples of application of the algorithm are also analyzed.
