We consider a large atom with nuclear charge Z described by non-relativistic quantum mechanics with classical or quantized electromagnetic field. We prove that the absolute ground state energy, allowing for minimizing over all possible self-generated electromagnetic fields, is given by the non-magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory to leading order in the simultaneous Z\to \infty, \al\to 0 limit if Z\al^2\leq \kappa for some universal \kappa, where \al is the fine structure constant.
