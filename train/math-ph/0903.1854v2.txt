In this paper, we determine the exact expression for the hydrogen binding energy in the Pauli-Fierz model up to the order O(\alpha^5\log\alpha^{-1}), where \alpha denotes the finestructure constant, and prove rigorous bounds on the remainder term of the order o(\alpha^5\log\alpha^{-1}). As a consequence, we prove that the binding energy is not a real analytic function of \alpha, and verify the existence of logarithmic corrections to the expansion of the ground state energy in powers of \alpha, as conjectured in the recent literature.
