A generalization of non-Abelian gauge theories of compact Lie groups is developed by gauging the non-compact group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of a D-dimensional space R^D. This group is represented on the space of fields defined on M^4 x R^D. As usual the gauging requires the introduction of a covariant derivative, a gauge field and a field strength operator. An invariant and minimal gauge field Lagrangian is derived. The classical field dynamics and the conservation laws of the new gauge theory are developed. Finally, the theory's Hamiltonian in the axial gauge and its Hamiltonian field dynamics are derived.
