In this paper we look for standing waves for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations  i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}+\Delta \psi - g(|y|) \psi -W^{\prime}(| \psi |)\frac{\psi}{| \psi |}=0  with cylindrically symmetric potentials g vanishing at infinity and non-increasing, and a C^1 nonlinear term satisfying weak assumptions. In particular we show the existence of standing waves with non-vanishing angular momentum with prescribed L^2 norm. The solutions are obtained via a minimization argument, and the proof is given for an abstract functional which presents lack of compactness. As a particular case we prove the existence of standing waves with non-vanishing angular momentum for the nonlinear hydrogen atom equation.
