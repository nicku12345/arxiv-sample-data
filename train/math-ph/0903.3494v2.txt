In this paper we further develop the method of quaternion typification of Clifford algebra elements suggested by the author in the previous paper. On the basis of new classification of Clifford algebra elements it is possible to reveal and prove a number of new properties of Clifford algebra. We use k-fold commutators and anticommutators. In this paper we consider Clifford and exterior degrees and elementary functions of Clifford algebra elements.
