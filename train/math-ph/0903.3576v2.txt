Classification of differential-difference equation of the form \ddot{u}_{nm}=F_{nm}\big(t, \{u_{pq}\}|_{(p,q)\in \Gamma}\big) are considered according to their Lie point symmetry groups. The set \Gamma represents the point (n,m) and its six nearest neighbors in a two-dimensional triangular lattice. It is shown that the symmetry group can be at most 12-dimensional for abelian symmetry algebras and 13-dimensional for nonsolvable symmetry algebras.
