In this paper we discuss the uniqueness of the unitary representations of the non commutative Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. We show that, apart from a critical line for the non commutative position and momentum parameters, the Stone-von Neumann theorem still holds, which implies uniqueness of the unitary representation of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra.
