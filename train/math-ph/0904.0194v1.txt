In two previous papers the author introduced a multiplication of distributions in one dimension and he proved that two one-dimensional Dirac delta functions and their derivatives can be multiplied, at least under certain conditions. Here, mainly motivated by some engineering applications in the analysis of the structures, we propose a different definition of multiplication of distributions which can be easily extended to any spatial dimension. In particular we prove that with this new definition delta functions and their derivatives can still be multiplied.
