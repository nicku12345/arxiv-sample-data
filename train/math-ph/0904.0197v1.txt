In this paper we show that the dissipative version of the laser model proposed by Alli and Sewell can be obtained by considering the stochastic limit of the (open system) hamiltonian introduced by Hepp and Lieb in their seminal work. We also prove that the Dicke-Haken-Lax hamiltonian produces, after the stochastic limit is considered, the generator of a semigroup with equations of motion very similar to those of Alli-Sewell, and coinciding with these under suitable conditions.
