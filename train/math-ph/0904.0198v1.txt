We review some applications of the perturbative technique known as the {\em stochastic limit approach} to the analysis of the following many-body problems: the fractional quantum Hall effect, the relations between the Hepp-Lieb and the Alli-Sewell models (as possible models of interaction between matter and radiation), and the open BCS model of low temperature superconductivity.
