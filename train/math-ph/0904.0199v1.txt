We propose an extension of {\em supersymmetric quantum mechanics} which produces a family of isospectral hamiltonians. Our procedure slightly extends the idea of intertwining operators. Several examples of the construction are given. Further, we show how to build up vector coherent states of the Gazeau-Klauder type associated to our hamiltonians.
