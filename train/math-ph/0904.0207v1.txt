We discuss a procedure to construct multi-resolution analyses (MRA) of \Lc^2(\R) starting from a given {\em seed} function h(s) which should satisfy some conditions. Our method, originally related to the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), is shown to be model independent. The role of a canonical map between certain canonically conjugate operators is discussed. This clarifies our previous procedure and makes much easier most of the original formulas, producing a convenient framework to produce examples of MRA.
