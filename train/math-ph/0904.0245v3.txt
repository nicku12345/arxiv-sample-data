The present article reveals important properties of the confluent Heun's functions. We derive a set of novel relations for confluent Heun's functions and their derivatives of arbitrary order. Specific new subclasses of confluent Heun's functions are introduced and studied. A new alternative derivation of confluent Heun's polynomials is presented.
