The completion of a (normed) C^*-algebra A_0[\| \cdot \|_0] with respect to a locally convex topology \tau on A_0 that makes the multiplication of A_0 separately continuous is, in general, a quasi *-algebra, and not a locally convex *-algebra. In this way, one is led to consideration of locally convex quasi C^*-algebras, which generalize C^*-algebras in the context of quasi *-algebras. Examples are given and the structure of these relatives of C^*-algebras is investigated.
