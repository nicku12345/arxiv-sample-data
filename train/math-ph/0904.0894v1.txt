Let A be a partial *-algebra endowed with a topology \tau that makes it into a locally convex topological vector space A[\tau]. Then A is called a topological partial *-algebra if it satisfies a number of conditions, which all amount to require that the topology \tau fits with the multiplier structure of A Besides the obvious cases of topological quasi *-algebras and CQ*-algebras, we examine several classes of potential topological partial *-algebras, either function spaces (lattices of L^p spaces on [0,1] or on \mathbb R, amalgam spaces), or partial *-algebras of operators (operators on a partial inner product space, O*-algebras).
