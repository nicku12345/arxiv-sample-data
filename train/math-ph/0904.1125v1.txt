We show that a simple and straightforward rational approximation to the Thomas-Fermi equation provides the slope at origin with unprecedented accuracy and that relatively small Pad\'e approximants are far more accurate than more elaborate approaches proposed recently by other authors. We consider both the Thomas-Fermi equation for isolated atoms and for atoms in strong magnetic fields.
