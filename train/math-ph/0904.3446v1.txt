The biquaternion approach is developed for building of the equations of the inter-action of different charges and currents and generated Electro-GravyMagnetic fields. The field analogues of three Newton's laws are offered free and interacting charge-currents, as well as total field of interaction. An invariance of the equations for one EGM-field model at Lorenz transformation is investigated, and, in particu-lar, law of the conservation of the charge-current. It is shown that at interaction by fields, this law differs from the well-known one. So for closing the equation of charge-currents transformations the new modification of Maxwell's equations is offered with entering the scalar field of resistance in the biquaternion of EGM-field tension. Relativistic formula for transformation of density of the masses and charge, current, forces and their powers are built.
