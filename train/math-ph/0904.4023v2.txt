Our aim in this paper is to study the Cahn-Hilliard equation with singular potentials and dynamic boundary conditions. In particular, we prove, owing to proper approximations of the singular potential and a suitable notion of variational solutions, the existence and uniqueness of solutions. We also discuss the separation of the solutions from the singularities of the potential. Finally, we prove the existence of global and exponential attractors.
