Analytic expressions for the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients of the SO(5) group that involve the 14-dimensional representation can be found in an old paper of M. K. F. Wong. A careful analysis yields that roughly 30% of the coefficients given in that paper are wrong. The correct analytic expressions for all SO(5) group CG coefficients containing the 14-dimensional representation are obtained.
