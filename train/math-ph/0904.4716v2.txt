Using Coherent-State (CS) techniques, we prove a sampling theorem for holomorphic functions on the hyperboloid (or its stereographic projection onto the open unit disk \mathbb D_1), seen as a homogeneous space of the pseudo-unitary group SU(1,1). We provide a reconstruction formula for bandlimited functions, through a sinc-type kernel, and a discrete Fourier transform from N samples properly chosen. We also study the case of undersampling of band-unlimited functions and the conditions under which a partial reconstruction from N samples is still possible and the accuracy of the approximation, which tends to be exact in the limit N\to\infty.
