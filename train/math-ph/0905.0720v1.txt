The classical Liouvile integrability means that there exist n independent first integrals in involution for 2n-dimensional phase space. However, in the infinite-dimensional case, an infinite number of independent first integrals in involution don't indicate that the system is solvable. How many first integrals do we need in order to make the system solvable? To answer the question, we obtain an infinite dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and prove an infinite dimensional Liouville theorem. Based on the theorem, we give a modified definition of the Liouville integrability in infinite dimension. We call it the L-integrability. As examples, we prove that the string vibration equation and the KdV equation are L-integrable. In general, we show that an infinite number of integrals is complete if all action variables of a Hamilton system can reconstructed by the set of first integrals.
