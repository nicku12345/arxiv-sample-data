The mathematical structure of the sheaf of Dedekind real numbers \RsubD(X) for a quantum system is discussed. The algebra of physical qualities is represented by an O^{*} algebra \mathcal M that acts on a Hilbert space that carries an irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the system. X =\EsubS(\mathcal M), the state space for \mathcal M, has the weak topology generated by the functions  a_{Q}(\cdot), defined for \hat A \in \mathcal M_{sa}  and \forall \hat \rho \in \EsubS(\mathcal M) , by  a_{Q}(\hat \rho) = Tr \hat A \hat \rho . For any open subset W of \EsubS(\mathcal M), the function  a_{Q}|_{W} is the numerical value of the quality \hat A defined to the extent W. The example of the quantum real numbers for a single Galilean relativistic particle is given.
