The one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with the point potential in the form of the derivative of Dirac's delta function, \lambda \delta'(x) with \lambda being a coupling constant, is investigated. This equation is known to require an extension to the space of wave functions \psi(x) discontinuous at the origin under the two-sided (at x=\pm 0) boundary conditions given through the transfer matrix {cc} {\cal A} 0 0 {\cal A}^{-1}) where {\cal A} = {2+\lambda \over 2-\lambda}. However, the recent studies, where a resonant non-zero transmission across this potential has been established to occur on discrete sets \{\lambda_n \}_{n=1}^\infty in the \lambda-space, contradict to these boundary conditions used widely by many authors. The present communication aims at solving this discrepancy using a more general form of boundary conditions.
