We consider the nonlinear Klein Gordon Maxwell system on four dimensional Minkowski space-time. For appropriate nonlinearities the system admits soliton solutions which are gauge invariant generalizations of the non-topological solitons introduced and studied by T.D. Lee and collaborators for pure complex scalar fields. We develop a rigorous dynamical perturbation theory for these solitons in the small e limit, where e is the electromagnetic coupling constant. The main theorems assert the long time stability of the solitons with respect to perturbation by an external electromagnetic field produced by the background current, and compute their effective dynamics to O(e). The effective dynamical equation is the equation of motion for a relativistic particle acted on by the Lorentz force law familiar from classical electrodynamics.
