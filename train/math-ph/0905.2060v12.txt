It is shown that the Lorentz force equation is equivalent to the auto-parallel condition \,^L\nabla_{\dot{{x}}}\dot{{x}}=0 of a linear connection ^L\nabla defined on a convenient pull-back vector bundle. By using a geometric averaging method, an associated {\it averaged Lorentz connection} \langle\,^L\nabla\rangle and the corresponding auto-parallel equation are obtained. After this, it is shown that in the ultra-relativistic limit and for narrow one-particle probability distribution functions, the auto-parallel curves of \langle\,^L\nabla\rangle remain {\it nearby} close to the auto-parallel curves of ^L\nabla. Applications of this result in beam dynamics and plasma physics are briefly described.
