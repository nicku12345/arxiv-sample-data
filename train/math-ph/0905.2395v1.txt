Three types of numerical data are provided for simple Lie groups of any type and rank. This data is indispensable for Fourier-like expansions of multidimensional digital data into finite series of C- or S-functions on the fundamental domain F of the underlying Lie group G. Firstly, we consider the number |F_M| of points in F from the lattice P^{\vee}_M, which is the refinement of the dual weight lattice P^{\vee} of G by a positive integer M. Secondly, we find the lowest set \Lambda_M of dominant weights, specifying the maximal set of C- and S-functions that are pairwise orthogonal on the point set F_M. Finally, we describe an efficient algorithm for finding, on the maximal torus of G, the number of conjugate points to every point of F_M. Discrete C- and S-transforms, together with their continuous interpolations, are presented in full generality.
