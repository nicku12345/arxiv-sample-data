We consider finite-dimensional complex Lie algebras. Using certain complex parameters we generalize the concept of cohomology cocycles of Lie algebras. A special case is generalization of 1-cocycles with respect to the adjoint representation - so called (\alpha,\beta,\gamma)--derivations. Parametric sets of spaces of cocycles allow us to define complex functions which are invariant under Lie isomorphisms. Such complex functions thus represent useful invariants - we show how they classify three and four-dimensional Lie algebras as well as how they apply to some eight-dimensional one-parametric nilpotent continua of Lie algebras. These functions also provide necessary criteria for existence of 1-parametric continuous contraction.
