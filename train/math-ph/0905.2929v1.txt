We propose a differential representation for the operators satisfying the q-mutation relation BB^\dagger-q B^\dagger B=\1 which generalizes a recent result by Eremin and Meldianov, and we discuss in detail this choice in the limit q\to1. Further, we build up non-linear and Gazeau-Klauder coherent states associated to the free quonic hamiltonian h_1=B^\dagger B. Finally we construct almost isospectrals quonic hamiltonians adopting the results on intertwining operators recently proposed by the author.
