Recently, the supersymmetry method was extended from Gaussian ensembles to arbitrary unitarily invariant matrix ensembles by generalizing the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. Here, we complete this extension by including arbitrary orthogonally and unitary-symplectically invariant matrix ensembles. The results are equivalent to, but the approach is different from the superbosonization formula. We express our results in a unifying way. We also give explicit expressions for all one-point functions and discuss features of the higher order correlations.
