We consider the dynamics of a harmonic crystal in the half-space with zero boundary condition. It is assumed that the initial date is a random function with zero mean, finite mean energy density which also satisfies a mixing condition of Rosenblatt or Ibragimov type. We study the distribution \mu_t of the solution at time t\in\R. The main result is the convergence of \mu_t to a Gaussian measure as t\to\infty which is time stationary with a covariance inherited from the initial (in general, non-Gaussian) measure.
