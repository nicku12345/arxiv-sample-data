Let \mathfrak{D} be the space consists of pairs (f,g), where f is a univalent function on the unit disc with f(0)=0, g is a univalent function on the exterior of the unit disc with g(\infty)=\infty and f'(0)g'(\infty)=1. In this article, we define the time variables t_n, n\in \Z, on \mathfrak{D} which are holomorphic with respect to the natural complex structure on \mathfrak{D} and can serve as local complex coordinates for \mathfrak{D}. We show that the evolutions of the pair (f,g) with respect to these time coordinates are governed by the dispersionless Toda hierarchy flows. An explicit tau function is constructed for the dispersionless Toda hierarchy. By restricting \mathfrak{D} to the subspace \Sigma consists of pairs where f(w)=1/\bar{g(1/\bar{w})}, we obtain the integrable hierarchy of conformal mappings considered by Wiegmann and Zabrodin \cite{WZ}. Since every C^1 homeomorphism \gamma of the unit circle corresponds uniquely to an element (f,g) of \mathfrak{D} under the conformal welding \gamma=g^{-1}\circ f, the space \text{Homeo}_{C}(S^1) can be naturally identified as a subspace of \mathfrak{D} characterized by f(S^1)=g(S^1). We show that we can naturally define complexified vector fields \pa_n, n\in \Z on \text{Homeo}_{C}(S^1) so that the evolutions of (f,g) on \text{Homeo}_{C}(S^1) with respect to \pa_n satisfy the dispersionless Toda hierarchy. Finally, we show that there is a similar integrable structure for the Riemann mappings (f^{-1}, g^{-1}). Moreover, in the latter case, the time variables are Fourier coefficients of \gamma and 1/\gamma^{-1}.
