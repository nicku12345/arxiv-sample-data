In this paper we introduce a geometric description of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian classical field theories on Lie algebroids in the framework of k-symplectic geometry. We discuss the relation between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions through a convenient notion of Legendre transformation. The theory is a natural generalization of the standard one; in addition, other interesting examples are studied, in particular, systems with symmetry and Poisson sigma models.
