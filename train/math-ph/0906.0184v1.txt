Arnold pointed out that the Euler equation of incompressible ideal hydrodynamics describes geodesics on the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. A simple analogue is the Euler equation for a rigid body, which is the geodesic equation on the rotation group with respect to a metric determined by the moment of inertia. The metric on the group is left-invariant but not right-invariant. We will reduce the geometry of such groups (using techniques popularized by Milnor) to algebra on their tangent space. In particular, the curvature can be expressed as a biquadratic form on the Lie algebra. Arnold's result that motion of incompressible fluids has instabilities (due to the sectional curvature being negative) can be recovered more simply. Surprisingly, such an instability arises in rigid body mechanics as well: the metric on SO(3) corresponding to the moment of inertia of a thin cylinder (coin) has negative sectional curvature in one tangent plane.   Both ideal fluids and rigid bodies can be thought of as hamiltonian systems with a quadratic hamiltonian, but whose Poisson brackets are those of a non-nilpotent Lie algebra. We will also describe a different point of view towards three dimensional incompressible flow in terms of the Clebsch parametrization. In this picture, the Poisson brackets are represented canonically. The hamiltonian is represented by a quartic function.   This is meant mainly as an expository article, aimed at a mathematical audience familiar with physics. Based on Lectures at the Chennai Mathematical Institute and the University of Connecticut.
