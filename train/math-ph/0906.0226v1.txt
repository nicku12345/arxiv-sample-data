Spectra of the second derivative operators corresponding to the special PT-symmetric point interactions are studied. The results are partly the completion of those obtained in [1]. The particular PT-symmetric point interactions causing unusual spectral effects are investigated for the systems defined on a finite interval as well. The spectrum of this type of interactions is very far from the self-adjoint case despite of PT-symmetry, P-pseudo-Hermiticity and T-self-adjointness.
