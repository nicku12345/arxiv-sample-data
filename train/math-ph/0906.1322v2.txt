We derive a upper bound on the free energy of a Bose gas system at density \rho and temperature T. In combination with the lower bound derived previously by Seiringer \cite{RS1}, our result proves that in the low density limit, i.e., when a^3\rho\ll 1, where a denotes the scattering length of the pair-interaction potential, the leading term of \Delta f the free energy difference per volume between interacting and ideal Bose gases is equal to 4\pi a (2\rho^2-[\rho-\rhoc]^2_+). Here, \rhoc(T) denotes the critical density for Bose-Einstein condensation (for the ideal gas), and [\cdot ]_+ = \max\{\cdot, 0\} denotes the positive part.
