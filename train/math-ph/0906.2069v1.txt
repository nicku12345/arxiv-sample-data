The block-diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is not sufficient for the transformation to the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) representation. The conditions enabling the transition from the Dirac representation to the FW one are formulated and proved. The connection between wave functions in the two representations is derived. The results obtained allows calculating expectation values of operators corresponding to main classical quantities.
