The main facts of the geometry of Finslerian 3-spinors are formulated. The close connection between Finslerian 3-spinors and vectors of the 9-dimensional linear Finslerian space is established. The isometry group of this space is described. The procedure of dimensional reduction to 4-dimensional quantities is formulated. The generalized Duffin-Kemmer equation for a Finslerian 3-spinor wave function of a free particle in the momentum representation is obtained.   From the viewpoint of a 4-dimensional observer, this 9-dimensional equation splits into the standard Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations.
