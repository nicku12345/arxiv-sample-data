Let A(\beta,\alpha,k) be the scattering amplitude corresponding to a real-valued potential which vanishes outside of a bounded domain D\subset \R^3. The unit vector \alpha is the direction of the incident plane wave, the unit vector \beta is the direction of the scattered wave, k>0 is the wave number. The governing equation for the waves is [\nabla^2+k^2-q(x)]u=0 in \R^3.   For a suitable class of potentials it is proved that if A_{q_1}(-\beta,\beta,k)=A_{q_2}(-\beta,\beta,k) \forall \beta\in S^2, \forall k\in (k_0,k_1), and q_1, q_2\in M, then q_1=q_2. This is a uniqueness theorem for the solution to the inverse scattering problem with backscattering data.   It is also proved for this class of potentials that if A_{q_1}(\beta,\alpha_0,k)=A_{q_2}(\beta,\alpha_0,k) \forall \beta\in S^2_1, \forall k\in (k_0,k_1), and q_1, q_2\in M,then q_1=q_2.   Here S^2_1 is an arbitrarily small open subset of S^2, and |k_0-k_1|>0 is arbitrarily small.
