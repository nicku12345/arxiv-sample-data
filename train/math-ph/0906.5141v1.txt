We consider the Moutard transformation which is a two-dimensional version of the well-known Darboux transformation. We give an algebraic interpretation of the Moutard transformation as a conjugation in an appropriate ring and the corresponding version of the algebro-geometric formalism for two-dimensional Schroedinger operators. An application to some problems of the spectral theory of two-dimensional Schroedinger operators and to the (2+1)-dimensional Novikov--Veselov equation is sketched.
