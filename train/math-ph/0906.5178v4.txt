We consider a heavy quantum particle with an internal degree of freedom moving on the d-dimensional lattice \bbZ^d (e.g., a heavy atom with finitely many excited states). The particle is coupled to a thermal medium (bath) consisting of free relativistic bosons through an interaction of strength \la linear in creation and annihilation operators. The mass of the quantum particle is assumed to be of order \la^{-2}, and we assume that the internal degree of freedom is coupled "effectively" to the thermal medium. We prove that the motion of the quantum particle is diffusive in d\geq 4 and for \la small enough.
