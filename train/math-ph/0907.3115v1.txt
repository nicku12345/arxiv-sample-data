The Shape invariant method has the algebraic structure and its algebras are infinite-dimensional. These algebras are converted into finite-dimensional under conditions. Based on the property of this method we obtain the algebraic structure of some physical potentials in the s-wave Klein-Gordon equation with scalar and vector potential which satisfy the Shape invariant condition.
