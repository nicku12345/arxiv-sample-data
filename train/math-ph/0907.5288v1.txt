Superintegrable Hamiltonian systems describing the interactions among three point masses on a line have been described in [2]. Here, we show examples of how the approach of above can be extended to a higher number of particles on a line and on higher dimensional manifolds. This paper is a slightly extended version of a poster presented at the XVI ICMP held in Prague, 3-8 August 2009.
