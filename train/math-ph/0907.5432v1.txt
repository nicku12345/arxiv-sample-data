We exhibit a class of integer spin systems whose free energy can be written in term of an absolutely convergent series at any temperature. This class includes spin systems on \Z^d interacting through infinite range pair potential polynomially decaying at large distances r at a rate 1/r^{d+\e} with \e>0. It also contains the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model in the disordered phase at large values of the crystal field.
