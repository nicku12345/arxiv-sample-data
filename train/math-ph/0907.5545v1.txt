We study the solutions of equations of type f(D,\alpha)u=v, where f(D,\alpha) is a p-adic pseudo-differential operator. If v is a Bruhat-Schwartz function, then there exists a distribution E_{\alpha}, a fundamental solution, such that u=E_{\alpha}\ast v is a solution. However, it is unknown to which function space E_{\alpha}\ast v belongs. In this paper, we show that if f(D,\alpha) is an elliptic operator, then u=E_{\alpha}\ast v belongs to a certain Sobolev space. Furthermore, we give conditions for the continuity and uniqueness of u. By modifying the Sobolev norm, we can establish that f(D,\alpha) gives an isomorphism between certain Sobolev spaces.
