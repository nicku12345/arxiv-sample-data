Consider an N-Boson system interacting via a two-body repulsive short-range potential V in a three dimensional box \Lambda of side length L. We take the limit N, L \to \infty while keeping the density \rho = N / L^3 fixed and small. We prove a new lower bound for its ground state energy per particle \frac{E(N, \Lambda)}{N} \geq 4 \pi a \rho [ 1 - O(\rho^{1/3} |\log \rho|^3) ], as \rho \to 0, where a is the scattering length of V.
