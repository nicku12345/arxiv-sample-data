For a subquadratic symbol H on \R^d\times\R^d = T^*(\R^d), the quantum propagator of the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = \hat H\psi is a Semiclassical Fourier-Integral Operator when \hat H=H(x,\hbar D_x) (\hbar-Weyl quantization of H). Its Schwartz kernel is describe by a quadratic phase and an amplitude. At every time t, when \hbar is small, it is "essentially supported" in a neighborhood of the graph of the classical flow generated by H, with a full uniform asymptotic expansion in \hbar for the amplitude. In this paper our goal is to revisit this well known and fondamental result with emphasis on the flexibility for the choice of a quadratic complex phase function and on global L^2 estimates when \hbar is small and time t is large. One of the simplest choice of the phase is known in chemical physics as Herman-Kluk formula. Moreover we prove that the semiclassical expansion for the propagator is valid for | t| << \frac{1}{4\delta}|\log\hbar| where \delta>0 is a stability parameter for the classical system.
