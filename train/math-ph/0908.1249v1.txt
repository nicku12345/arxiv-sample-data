The time-dependent form of Tappert's range refraction parabolic equation is derived using Daletskiy-Krein formula form noncommutative analysis and proposed as an artificial boundary condition for the wave equation in a waveguide. The numerical comparison with Higdon's absorbing boundary conditions shows sufficiently good quality of the new boundary condition at low computational cost.
