The notion of q-grading on the enveloping algebra generated by products of q-deformed Heisenberg algebras is introduced for q complex number in the unit disc. Within this formulation, we consider the extension of the notion of supersymmetry in the enveloping algebra. We recover the ordinary \mathbb{Z}_2 grading or Grassmann parity for associative superalgebra, and a modified version of the usual supersymmetry. As a specific problem, we focus on the interesting limit q\to -1 for which the Arik and Coon deformation of the Heisenberg algebra allows to map fermionic modes to bosonic ones in a modified sense. Different algebraic consequences are discussed.
