In contrast with QFT, classical field theory can be formulated in a strict mathematical way by treating classical fields as sections of smooth fibre bundles. Addressing to the theoreticians, these Lectures aim to compile the relevant material on fibre bundles, jet manifolds, connections, graded manifolds and Lagrangian theory. They follow the perennial course of lectures on geometric methods in field theory at the Department of Theoretical Physics of Moscow State University.
