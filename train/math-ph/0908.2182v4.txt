We obtain the classical r-matrices of two and three dimensional Lie super-bialgebras. We thus classify all two and three dimensional coboundary Lie super-bialgebras and their types (triangular, quasi-triangular, or factorable). Using the Sklyanin superbracket, we then obtain the super Poisson structures on the related Poisson-Lie supergroups.
