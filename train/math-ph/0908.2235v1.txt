The theory of Lie systems has recently been applied to Quantum Mechanics and additionally some integrability conditions for Lie systems of differential equations have also recently been analysed from a geometric perspective. In this paper we use both developments to obtain a geometric theory of integrability in Quantum Mechanics and we use it to provide a series of non-trivial integrable quantum mechanical models and to recover some known results from our unifying point of view.
