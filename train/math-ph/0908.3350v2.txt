In this paper, the following results are proved: (1)   If E is a complete atomic lattice effect algebra, then E is (o)-continuous iff E is order-topological iff E is totally order-disconnected iff E is algebraic. (2)   If E is a complete atomic distributive lattice effect algebra, then its Frink ideal topology \tau_{id} is Hausdorff topology and \tau_{id} is finer than its order topology \tau_{o}, and \tau_{id}=\tau_o iff 1 is finite iff every element of E is finite iff \tau_{id} and \tau_o are both discrete topologies. (3)   If E is a complete (o)-continuous lattice effect algebra and the operation \oplus is order topology \tau_o continuous, then its order topology \tau_{o} is Hausdorff topology. (4)   If E is a (o)-continuous complete atomic lattice effect algebra, then \oplus is order topology continuous.
