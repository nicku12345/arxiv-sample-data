A shear-free ray congruence on Minkowski space is a 3-parameter family of null geodesics along which Lie transport of a complementary 2-dimensional spacelike subspace (called the screen space) is conformal. Such congruences are defined by complex analytic surfaces in the associated twistor space \CP^3 and are the basis of the construction of massless fields. On a more general space-time, it is unclear how to couple the massless field with the gravitational field. In this article we do this by considering the following Cauchy-type problem: given a Riemannian 3-manifold (M^3, g_0) endowed with a unit vector field U_0 that is tangent to a conformal foliation, we require that the pair extend to a space-time ({\mathcal M}, {\mathcal G}) endowed with a spacelike unit vector field U_t in such a way that U_t simultaneously generates null geodesics and is tangent to a conformal foliation on spacelike slices t= const.
