Given n charges interacting with each other according to Feynman's law. Let (r_j(t),v_j(t)) denote the position and velocity of the charge q_j. The list y(t) of all such vectors is called a trajectory. A Lipschitzian trajectory x(t), (t\le0), with continuous derivative, on which the velocities do not exceed some limiting velocity v<c, where c denotes the speed of light, is called an initial trajectory. A locally Lipschitzian trajectory y(t) is called relativistically admissible if the velocities on it stay below the speed of light c.   The author constructs operators \Phi_{j} of a trajectory whose values \Phi_j(y)(t) are linear transformations of R^3 into R^3. A point t=t_1 on a trajectory y is called singular if either some of the charges collide at the time t_1 or the determinant is zero for at least one of the transformations \Phi_j(y)(t_1).   The main result is the following: If x(t) (t\le0) is an initial trajectory with nonsingular point t=0, then there exists a unique relativistically admissible trajectory y(t), defined for t in an interval I\subset < 0,\infty), extending the initial trajectory x(t) and having the following properties. (1) No point t on the trajectory y is singular. (2) The trajectory represents a unique solution of the Newton-Einstein momentum-force system of equations under Lorentz forces induced by electromagnetic field in accord to Feynman's law for moving point charges. (3) The trajectory y represents the maximal global solution of the system.
