A generalization of Jacobi's elliptic functions is introduced as inversions of hyperelliptic integrals. We discuss the special properties of these functions, present addition theorems and give a list of indefinite integrals. As a physical application we show that periodic kink solutions (kink chains) of the double sine-Gordon model can be described in a canonical form in terms of generalized Jacobi functions.
