We introduce notions of {\mathcal O}-operators of the Loday algebras including the dendriform algebras and quadri-algebras as a natural generalization of Rota-Baxter operators. The invertible \mathcal O-operators give a sufficient and necessary condition on the existence of the 2^{n+1} operations on an algebra with the 2^{n} operations in an associative cluster. The analogues of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in these algebras can be understood as the \mathcal O-operators associated to certain dual bimodules. As a byproduct, the constraint conditions (invariances) of nondegenerate bilinear forms on these algebras are given.
