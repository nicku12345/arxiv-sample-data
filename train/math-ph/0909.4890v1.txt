In this paper we find a class of new degenerate central configurations and bifurcations in the Newtonian n-body problem. In particular we analyze the Rosette central configurations, namely a coplanar configuration where n particles of mass m_1 lie at the vertices of a regular n-gon, n particles of mass m_2 lie at the vertices of another n-gon concentric with the first, but rotated of an angle \pi/n, and an additional particle of mass m_0 lies at the center of mass of the system. This system admits two mass parameters \mu=m_0/m_1 and \ep=m_2/m_1. We show that, as \mu varies, if n> 3, there is a degenerate central configuration and a bifurcation for every \ep>0, while if n=3 there is a bifurcations only for some values of \epsilon.
