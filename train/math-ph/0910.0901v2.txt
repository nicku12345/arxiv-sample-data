Darboux transformation is one of the methods used in solving nonlinear evolution equation. Basically, the Darboux transformation is a linear algebra formulation of the solutions of the Zakharov-Shabat system of equations associated with the nonlinear evolution equation. In this work, the evolution of monochromatic electromagnetic wave in a nonlinear-dispersive optical medium is considered. Using the Darboux transformation, explicit multisoliton solutions (one to three soliton solutions) are obtained from a trivial initial solution.
