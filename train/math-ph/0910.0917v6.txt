We study the spectral stability of solitary wave solutions to the nonlinear Dirac equation in one dimension. We focus on the Dirac equation with cubic nonlinearity, known as the Soler model in (1+1) dimensions and also as the massive Gross-Neveu model. Presented numerical computations of the spectrum of linearization at a solitary wave show that the solitary waves are spectrally stable. We corroborate our results by finding explicit expressions for several of the eigenfunctions. Some of the analytic results hold for the nonlinear Dirac equation with generic nonlinearity.
