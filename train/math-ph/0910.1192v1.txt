A few recent innovations of applicability of standard textbook Quantum Theory are reviewed. The three-Hilbert-space formulation of the theory (known from the interacting boson models in nuclear physics) is discussed in its slightly broadened four-Hilbert-space update. Among applications involving several new scattering and bound-state problems the central role is played by the models using apparently non-Hermitian ("crypto-Hermitian") Hamiltonians with real spectra. The formalism (originally inspired by the topical need of mathematically consistent description of tobogganic quantum models) is shown to admit certain unusual nonlocal and/or "moving-frame" representations of the standard physical Hilbert space of wave functions.
