Various infinite-dimensional versions of the Calogero-Moser operator are discussed. The related class of Jack-Laurent symmetric functions is studied. In the special case when parameter k=-1 the analogue of Jacobi-Trudy formula is given and the relation with representation theory of Lie superlagebra gl(m,n) is discussed.
