The stationary states of the half-line Coulomb potential are described by quantum-mechanical wavefunctions which are controlled by the Laguerre polynomials L_n^{(1)}(x). Here we first calculate the qth-order frequency or entropic moments of this quantum system, which is controlled by some entropic functionals of the Laguerre polynomials. These functionals are shown to be equal to a Lauricella function F_A^{(2q+1)}(\frac{1}{q},...,\frac{1}{q},1) by use of the Srivastava-Niukkanen linearization relation of Laguerre polynomials. The resulting general expressions are applied to obtain the following information-theoretic quantities of the half-line Coulomb potential: disequilibrium, Renyi and Tsallis entropies. An alternative and simpler expression for the linear entropy is also found by means of a different method. Then, the Shannon entropy and the LMC or shape complexity of the lowest and highest (Rydberg) energetic states are explicitly given; moreover, sharp information-theoretic-based upper bounds to these quantities are found for general physical states. These quantities are numerically discussed for the ground and various excited states. Finally, the uncertainty measures of the half-line Coulomb potential given by the information-theoretic lengths are discussed.
