The third part of the present paper continues the investigation of the solution of the multivariable cubic algebraic equation for reparametrization invariance of the gravitational Lagrangian. The main result in this paper constitutes the fact that the earlier found parametrization functions of the cubic algebraic equation for reparametrization invariance of the gravitational Lagrangian can be considered also as uniformization functions. These functions are obtained as solutions of first - order nonlinear differential equations, as a result of which they depend only on the complex (uniformization) variable z. Further, it has been demonstrated that this uniformization can be extended to two complex variables, which is particularly important for investigating various physical metrics, for example the ADS metric of constant negative curvature (Lobachevsky spaces).
