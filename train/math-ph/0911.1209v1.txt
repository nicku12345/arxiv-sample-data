We show that the deformation quantization of non-commutative quantum mechanics previously considered by Dias and Prata can be expressed as a Weyl calculus on a double phase space. We study the properties of the star-product thus defined, and prove a spectral theorem for the star-genvalue equation using an extension of the methods recently initiated by de Gosson and Luef.
