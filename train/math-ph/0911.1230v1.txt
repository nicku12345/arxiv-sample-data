In this paper we study the fundamental solution of the equation obtained by the linearisation of the Smoluchowski coagulation equation with the multiplicative kernel (x y)^{\lambda/2} with \lambda\in (1, 2) around the steady state f(x)=x^{-(3+\lambda)/2}. An explicit representation formula as well as detailed estimates on its asymptotics are obtained. We also describe in a detailed form particle fluxes between different sizes for this linearised equation.
