A systematic group-theoretical analysis of the supersymmetric sinh-Gordon equation is performed. A generalization of the method of prolongations is used to determine the Lie superalgebra of symmetries, and the method of symmetry reduction is applied in order to obtain invariant solutions of the supersymmetric sinh-Gordon equation. The results are compared with those previously found for the supersymmetric sine-Gordon equation. The presence of nonstandard invariants is discussed for the supersymmetric sinh-Gordon equation, as well as for the supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries equation.
