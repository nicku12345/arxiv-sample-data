Using adjoint representation we firstly classify two and three dimensional Lie super-bialgebras obtain from decomposable Lie superalgebras. In this way we complete the classification obtained by Eghbali et al., [J. Math. Phys. 51, 073503 (2010); e-print arXiv:0901.4471 [math-ph]]. Then we classify all four and six dimensional Drinfel'd superdoubles.
