We apply a special case, the restriction principle (for which we give a definition simpler than the usual one), of a basic result in functional analysis (the polar decomposition of an operator) in order to define C_{\mu, t}, the C-version of the Segal-Bargmann transform, associated to a finite Coxeter group acting in \mathbb{R}^N and a given value t>0 of Planck's constant, where \mu is a multiplicity function on the roots defining the Coxeter group. Then we immediately prove that C_{\mu, t} is a unitary isomorphism. To accomplish this we identify the reproducing kernel function of the appropriate Hilbert space of holomorphic functions. As consequences we prove that the Segal-Bargmann transforms for Versions A, B and D are also unitary isomorphisms, though not by a direct application of the restriction principle. The point is that the C-version is the the only version where a restriction principle, in our definition of this method, applies directly. This reinforces the idea that the C-version is the most fundamental, most natural version of the Segal-Bargmann transform.
