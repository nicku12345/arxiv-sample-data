New solvable vertex models can be easily obtained by staggering the spectral parameter in already known ones. This simple construction reveals some surprises: for appropriate values of the staggering, highly non-trivial continuum limits can be obtained. The simplest case of staggering with period two (the Z_2 case) for the six-vertex model was shown to be related, in one regime of the spectral parameter, to the critical antiferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice, and has a non-compact continuum limit. Here, we study the other regime: in the very anisotropic limit, it can be viewed as a zig-zag spin chain with spin anisotropy, or as an anyonic chain with a generic (non-integer) number of species. From the Bethe-Ansatz solution, we obtain the central charge c=2, the conformal spectrum, and the continuum partition function, corresponding to one free boson and two Majorana fermions. Finally, we obtain a massive integrable deformation of the model on the lattice. Interestingly, its scattering theory is a massive version of the one for the flow between minimal models. The corresponding field theory is argued to be a complex version of the C_2^{(2)} Toda theory.
