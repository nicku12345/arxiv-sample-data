We consider composition and division algebras over the real numbers: We note two r\^oles for the group G_{2}: as automorphism group of the octonions and as the isotropy group of a generic 3-form in 7 dimensions. We show why they are equivalent, by means of a regular metric. We express in some diagrams the relation between some pertinent groups, most of them related to the octonions. Some applications to physics are also discussed.
