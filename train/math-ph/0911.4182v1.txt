The author recalls general tendencies of the "mathematization" of the sciences and derives challenges and tentative obstructions for a successful merger of mathematics and physics on fancied steps towards "Quantum Gravity". This is an edited version of the author's opening words to an international workshop "Quantum Gravity: An Assessment", Denmark, May 17-18, 2008. It followed immediately after the Quantum Gravity Summer School 2008, see http://QuantumGravity.ruc.dk/
