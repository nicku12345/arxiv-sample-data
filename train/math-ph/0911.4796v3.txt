The C library \texttt{libkww} provides functions to compute the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function, i.e.\ the Laplace-Fourier transform of the stretched (or compressed) exponential function \exp(-t^\beta) for exponents \beta between 0.1 and 1.9 with sixteen-digits accuracy. Analytic error bounds are derived for the low and high frequency series expansions. For intermediate frequencies the numeric integration is enormously accelerated by using the Ooura-Mori double exponential transformation. The source code is available from the project home page \url{http://apps.jcns.fz-juelich.de/doku/sc/kww}.
