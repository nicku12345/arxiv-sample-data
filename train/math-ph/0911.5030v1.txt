We formulate and discuss a number of conjectures on the ground state vectors of the XYZ-spin chains of odd length with periodic boundary conditions and a special choice of the Hamiltonian parameters. In particular, arguments for the validity of a sum rule for the components, which describes in a sense the degree of antiferromagneticity of the chain, are given.
