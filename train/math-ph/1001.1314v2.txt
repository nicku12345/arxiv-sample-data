In this proceeding we present the nested Bethe ansatz for open spin chains of XXX-type, with arbitrary representations (i.e. `spins') on each site of the chain and diagonal boundary matrices (K^+(u),K^-(u)). The nested Bethe anstaz applies for a general K^-(u), but a particular form of the K^+(u) matrix. We give the eigenvalues, Bethe equations and the form of the Bethe vectors for the corresponding models. The Bethe vectors are expressed using a trace formula.
