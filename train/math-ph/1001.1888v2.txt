Discussed is a model of the two-dimensional affinely-rigid body with the double dynamical isotropy. We investigate the systems with potential energies for which the variables can be separated. The special stress is laid on the model of the harmonic oscillator potential and certain anharmonic alternatives. Some explicit solutions are found on the classical, quasiclassical (Bohr-Sommerfeld) and quantum level.
