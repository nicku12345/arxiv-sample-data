The linearized kinetic equation modelling behaviour of the degenerate quantum bose gas with the frequency of collisions depending on momentum of elementary excitations is constructed. The general case of dependence of the elementary excitations energy on momentum according to Bogolyubov formula is considered. The analytical solution of the half-space boundary problem on temperature jump on border of degenerate bose gas in the presence of a Bose - Einstein condensate is received. Expression for Kapitsa resistance is received.
