The quantum analogs of the N-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces with different combinations of quantum and Cayley-Klein structures are described for non-minimal multipliers, which include the first and the second powers of contraction parameters in the transformation of deformation parameter. The noncommutative analogs of (N-1)-dimensional constant curvature spaces are introduced. Part of these spaces for N=5 are interpreted as the noncommutative analogs of (1+3) space-time models. As a result the wide variety of the quantum deformations of realistic kinematics are suggested.
