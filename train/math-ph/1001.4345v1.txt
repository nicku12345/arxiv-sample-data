It is shown that the dispersion and attenuation functions in a linear viscoelastic medium with a positive relaxation spectrum have a sublinear growth rate at very high frequencies. A local dispersion relation in parametric form is found. The exact limit between attenuation growth rates compatible and incompatible with finite propagation speed is found.   Incompatibility of superlinear frequency dependence of attenuation with finite speed of propagation and with the assumption of positive relaxation spectrum is demonstrated.
