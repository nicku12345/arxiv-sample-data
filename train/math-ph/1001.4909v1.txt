By applying methods already discussed in a previous series of papers by the same authors, we construct here classes of integrable quantum systems which correspond to n fully resonant oscillators with nonlinear couplings. The same methods are also applied to a series of nontrivial integral sets of functions, which can be constructed when additional symmetries are present due to the equality of some of the frequencies. Besides, for n=3 and resonance 1:1:2, an exceptional integrable system is obtained, in which integrability is not explicitly connected with this type of symmetry. In this exceptional case, quantum integrability can be realized by means of a modification of the symmetrization procedure.
