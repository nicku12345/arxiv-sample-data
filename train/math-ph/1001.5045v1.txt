In this paper, we examine some basic properties of the multiple-Sine-Gordon (MSG) systems, which constitute a generalization of the celebrated sine-Gordon (SG) system. We start by showing how MSG systems can be viewed as a general class of periodic functions. Next, periodic and step-like solutions of these systems are discussed in some details. In particular, we study the static properties of such systems by considering slope and phase diagrams. We also use concepts like energy density and pressure to characterize and distinguish such solutions. We interpret these solutions as an interacting many body system, in which kinks and antikinks behave as extended particles. Finally, we provide a linear stability analysis of periodic solutions which indicates short wavelength solutions to be stable.
