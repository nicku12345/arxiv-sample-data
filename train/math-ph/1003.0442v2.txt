Assume that in a Lorentzian frame is given a relativistically admissible trajectory of a point mass. An event in such a frame can be described by four coordinates, first three representing the position and the last one the time of the event. Let G denote the set of all events that do not lie on the trajectory.   The trajectory uniquely determines on the set G a system of fields called by the author the fundamental fields. The most important are the following three: (1) The retarded time field, representing the time a wave should be emitted from the trajectory to arrive at some point of the set of events G; (2) The delayed time field, representing the difference between the actual time of the event and the retarded time; (3) The unit vector field representing the direction in which the wave should be emitted.   In the paper arXiv:0909.5240 the author used the fundamental fields to prove, that the fields of the amended Feynman's Law satisfy the homogeneous system of Maxwell equations, and to obtain explicit formulas for Feynman fields in terms of the fundamental fields.   In this note the author proves that any field on the set G of events can be represented as a function of the three fields mentioned above. The joint range of these three fields represents a differentiable manifold M diffeomorphic with the set G of the events. The manifold consists of the Cartesian product of the space R of reals, the space of positive real numbers, and the unit sphere in 3 dimensional Euclidean space.
