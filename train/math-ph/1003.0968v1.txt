We consider a time-dependent one-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equation with a symmetric potential double well represented by two delta interactions. Among our results we give an explicit formula for the integral kernel of the unitary semigroup associated with the linear part of the Hamiltonian. Then we establish the corresponding Strichartz-type estimate and we prove local existence and uniqueness of the solution to the original nonlinear problem.
