The reduced properties and applications of Yangian Y(sl(2)) and Y(su(3)) algebras are discussed. By taking a special constraint, the representation of Y(su(3)) can be divided into three 3 * 3 blocks diagonal based on Gell-mann matrices. The reduced Yangian Y(sl(2)) and Y(su(3)) are applied to the bi-qubit system and the mixed light pseudoscalar meson state respectively, and are both able to make the final states disentangled after acting on the initial state by the transition operator, composed of the generators of Yangian.
