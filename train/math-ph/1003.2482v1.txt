Recently Guenther et al the globally diagonalized {\alpha}^{2} dynamo operator spectrum [J Phys A 2007) in mean field media, and its Krein space related perturbation theory [J Phys A 2006). Earlier, an example of fast dynamos in stretch shear and fold Anosov maps have been given by Gilbert [PRSA [1993)). In this paper, analytical solutions representing general turbulent dynamo filaments are obtained in resistive plasmas. When turbulent diffusivity is present and kinetic helicity vanishes, a fast dynamo mode is obtained, and the Anosov eigenvalue obtained. The magnetic field lays down on a Frenet 2 plane along the filaments embedded in a 3D flow. Curvature effects on fast dynamo are also investigate. In case of weak curvature filaments the one dimensional manifolds in plasmas present a fast dynamo action. A parallel result has been obtained by Chicone et al [Comm Math Phys), in the case fast dynamo spectrum in two dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds of negative constant curvature, called Anosov spaces. While problems of embedding may appear in their case here no embedding problems appear since the one dimensional curved plasmas are embedded in three dimensional Euclidean spaces. In the examples considered here, equipartion between normal and binormal components of the magnetic field components is considered. In the opposite case, non Anosov oscillatory, purely imaginary, branches of the spectrum are found in dynamo manifold. Negative constant curvature non-compact \textbf{H}^{2} manifold, has also been used in one-component electron 2D plasma by Fantoni and Tellez (Stat. Phys, (2008))
