A single Dirac particle is bound in d dimensions by vector V(r) and scalar S(r) central potentials. The spin-symmetric S=V and pseudo-spin-symmetric S = - V cases are studied and it is shown that if two such potentials are ordered V^{(1)} \le V^{(2)}, then corresponding discrete eigenvalues are all similarly ordered E_{\kappa \nu}^{(1)} \le E_{\kappa \nu}^{(2)}. This comparison theorem allows us to use envelope theory to generate spectral approximations with the aid of known exact solutions, such as those for Coulombic, harmonic-oscillator, and Kratzer potentials. The example of the log potential V(r) = v\ln(r) is presented. Since V(r) is a convex transformation of the soluble Coulomb potential, this leads to a compact analytical formula for lower-bounds to the discrete spectrum. The resulting ground-state lower-bound curve E_{L}(v) is compared with an accurate graph found by direct numerical integration.
