The treatment of a quantized field in a curved spacetime requires the study of backreaction of the field on the spacetime via the semiclassical Einstein equation. We consider a free scalar field in spatially flat Robertson-Walker space time. We require the state of the field to allow for a renormalized semiclassical stress tensor. We calculate the sigularities of the stress tensor restricted to equal times in agreement with the usual renormalization prescription for Hadamard states to perform an explicit renormalization. The dynamical system for the Robertson Walker scale parameter a(t) coupled to the scalar field is finally derived for the case of conformal and also general coupling.
