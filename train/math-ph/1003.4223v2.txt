We establish an improved upper estimate on dimension of any solvable algebra s with its nilradical isomorphic to a given nilpotent Lie algebra n. Next we consider Levi decomposable algebras with a given nilradical n and investigate restrictions on possible Levi factors originating from the structure of characteristic ideals of n. We present a new perspective on Turkowski's classification of Levi decomposable algebras up to dimension 9.
