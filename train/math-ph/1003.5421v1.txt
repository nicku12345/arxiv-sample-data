We construct a family of coherent states transforms attached to generalized Bargmann spaces [C.R. Acad.Sci.Paris, t.325,1997] in the complex plane. This constitutes another way of obtaining the kernel of an isometric operator linking the space of square integrable functions on the real line with the true-poly-Fock spaces [Oper.Theory. Adv.Appl.,v.117,2000].
