We propose the application of graphical convolution to the analysis of the resonance phenomenon. This time-domain approach encompasses both the finally attained periodic oscillations and the initial transient period. It also provides interesting discussion concerning the analysis of non-sinusoidal waves, based not on frequency analysis, but on direct consideration of waveforms, and thus presenting an introduction to Fourier series. Further developing the point of view of graphical convolution, we come to a new definition of resonance in terms of time domain.
