We study some particular solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with density-dependent viscosity and with pressure, in radial symmetry. With extension of the previous known blowup solutions for the Euler-Poisson equations / pressureless Navier-Stokes-Poisson with density-dependent viscosity, we constructed the corresponding analytical blowup solutions for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson Equations with density-dependent viscosity and with pressure.
