For a certain class of partitions, a simple qualitative relation is observed between the shape of the Young diagram and the pattern of zeroes of the Wronskian of the corresponding Hermite polynomials. In the case of two-term Wronskian W(H_n, H_{n+k}) we give an explicit formula for the asymptotic shape of the zero set as n \rightarrow \infty. Some empirical asymptotic formulas are given for the zero sets of three and four-term Wronskians.
