The search for a quantum theory of gravity has become one of the most well-known problems in theoretical physics. Problems quantizing general relativity because it is not renormalizable have led to a search for a new theory of gravity that, while still agreeing with measured observations, is renormalizable. In this paper, a spin-1 Yang-Mills force theory with a SO(4,1) or {\em de Sitter} group symmetry is developed. By deriving the standard geodesic equation and the first post-Newtonian approximation equations, it is shown that this theory, coupled to Dirac fields, predicts all N-body and light observations of gravitational phenomena to within experimental accuracy. Furthermore, because of the separation of gauge covariance from coordinate diffeomorphism, the theory satisfies the strong equivalence principle while maintaining a Minkowski coordinate metric. Cosmology is also briefly addressed: Vacuum energy is the most common explanation for the accelerating expansion of the universe but suffers from the drawback that any reasonable prediction of it is 120 orders of magnitude too large. The de Sitter solution to the Einstein Field Equations is an alternative to vacuum energy as an explanation for the accelerating expansion of the universe but only if the universe is approximately a vacuum. The proposed gauge theory, however, avoids both these problems and, cosmologically, the accelerating expansion of the universe is shown as a consequence of the de Sitter group Lie algebra. In addition, with quantized mass, because it is a generic massless, semi-simple Yang-Mills theory, it is mathematically proved to be a perturbatively renormalizable quantum theory of gravity.
