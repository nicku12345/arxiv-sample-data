Let \omega be a factor state on the quasi-local algebra \cal{A} of observables generated by a relativistic quantum field, which in addition satisfies certain regularity conditions (satisfied by ground states and the recently constructed thermal states of the P(\phi)_2 theory). We prove that there exist space and time translation invariant states, some of which are arbitrarily close to \omega in the weak* topology, for which the time evolution is weakly asymptotically abelian.
