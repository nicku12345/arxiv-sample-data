We study subsolutions of the Dirac and Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equations described in our earlier papers. It is shown that subsolutions of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equations and those of the Dirac equation obey the same Dirac equation with some built-in projection operator. This covariant equation can be referred to as supersymmetric since it has bosonic as well as fermionic degrees of freedom.
