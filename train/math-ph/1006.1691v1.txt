The inner structure of the {\gamma}{\epsilon}-formalisms of Infeld and van der Waerden admits the occurrence of spin-tensor electromagnetic fields which bear invariance under the action of the generalized Weyl gauge group. A concise derivation of the wave equations for such fields is carried out explicitly along with the construction of a set of torsionless covariant-derivative expressions. It is emphatically pointed out that the integration of the wave equations arising herein may under certain circumstances produce significant insights into the situation concerning the description of some physical properties of the cosmic microwave background.
