Within the geometrical framework developed in arXiv:0705.2362, the problem of minimality for constrained calculus of variations is analysed among the class of differentiable curves. A fully covariant representation of the second variation of the action functional, based on a suitable gauge transformation of the Lagrangian, is explicitly worked out. Both necessary and sufficient conditions for minimality are proved, and are then reinterpreted in terms of Jacobi fields.
