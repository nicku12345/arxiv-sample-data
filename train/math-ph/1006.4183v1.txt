We describe the geometric structures involved in the variational formulation of physical theories. In presence of these structures, the constitutive set of a physical system can be generated by a family of functions. We discuss conditions, under which a family of functions generates an immersed Lagrangian submanifold. These conditions are given in terms of the Hessian of the family.
