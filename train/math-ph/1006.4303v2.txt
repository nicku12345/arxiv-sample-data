In this paper we present some results obtained in a previous paper about the Cartan's approach to Riemannian normal coordinates and our conformal transformations among pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We also review the classical and the quantum angular momenta of a particle obtained as a consequence of geometry, without postulates. We present four classical principles, identifed as new results obtained from geometry. One of them has properties similar Heisemberg's uncertaintly principle and another has some properties similar to Bohr's principle. Our geometric result can be considered as a possible starting point toward a quantum theory without forces.
