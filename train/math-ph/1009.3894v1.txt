Random Hermitian matrices with a source term arise, for instance, in the study of non-intersecting Brownian walkers \cite{Adler:2009a, Daems:2007} and sample covariance matrices \cite{Baik:2005}.   We consider the case when the n\times n external source matrix has two distinct real eigenvalues: a with multiplicity r and zero with multiplicity n-r. The source is small in the sense that r is finite or r=\mathcal O(n^\gamma), for 0< \gamma<1. For a Gaussian potential, P\'ech\'e \cite{Peche:2006} showed that for |a| sufficiently small (the subcritical regime) the external source has no leading-order effect on the eigenvalues, while for |a| sufficiently large (the supercritical regime) r eigenvalues exit the bulk of the spectrum and behave as the eigenvalues of r\times r Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). We establish the universality of these results for a general class of analytic potentials in the supercritical and subcritical regimes.
