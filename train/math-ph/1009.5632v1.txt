In this paper we employ a novel technique combining the Euler Maclaurin formula with the saddle point approximation method to obtain the asymptotic behavior (in the limit of large representation index J) of generic Wigner matrix elements D^{J}_{MM'}(g). We use this result to derive asymptotic formulae for the character \chi^J(g) of an SU(2) group element and for Wigner's 3j symbol. Surprisingly, given that we perform five successive layers of approximations, the asymptotic formula we obtain for \chi^J(g) is in fact exact. This result provides a non trivial example of a Duistermaat-Heckman like localization property for discrete sums.
