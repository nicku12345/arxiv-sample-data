Dispersive averaging effects are used to show that KdV equation with periodic boundary conditions possesses high frequency solutions which behave nearly linearly. Numerical simulations are presented which indicate high accuracy of this approximation. Furthermore, this result is applied to shallow water wave dynamics in the limit of KdV approximation, which is obtained by asymptotic analysis in combination with numerical simulations of KdV.
