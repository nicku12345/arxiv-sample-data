The Hamiltonian of a system of two quantum mechanical particles moving on the d-dimensional lattice \Z^d and interacting via zero-range attractive pair potentials is considered. For the two-particle energy operator H_{\mu}(K), K\in \T^d=(-\pi,\pi]^d -- the two-particle quasi-momentum, the existence of a unique positive eigenvalue z(\mu, K) above the upper edge of the essential spectrum of H_{\mu}(K) is proven and asymptotics for z(\mu, K) are found when \mu approaches to some \mu_0(K) and K\to 0.
