In this paper we derive a new class of sum rules for products of the Bessel functions of first kind. Using standard algebraic manipulations we extend some of the well known properties of J_n. Some physical applications of the results are also discussed. A comparison with the Newberger[J. Math. Phys. \textbf{23} (1982) 1278] sum rules is performed on a typical example.
