The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Cauchy problem for the Gross-Pitaevskii infinite linear hierarchy of equations on \mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 1. We prove local existence and uniqueness of solutions in certain Sobolev type spaces \mathrm{H}^{\alpha}_{\xi} of sequences of marginal density operators with \alpha > n/2. In particular, we give a clear discussion of all cases \alpha > n/2, which covers the local well-posedness problem for Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy in this situation.
