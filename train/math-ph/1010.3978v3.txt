We investigate whether a second order Wick polynomial T of a free scalar field, including derivatives, is essentially self-adjoint on the natural (Wightman) domain in a quasi-free (i.e. Fock space) Hadamard representation. We restrict our attention to the case where T is smeared with a test-function from a particular class S, namely the class of sums of squares of testfunctions. This class of smearing functions is smaller than the class of all non-negative testfunctions -- a fact which follows from Hilbert's Theorem. Exploiting the microlocal spectrum condition we prove that T is essentially self-adjoint if it is a Wick square (without derivatives). More generally we show that T is essentially self-adjoint if its compression to the one-particle Hilbert space is essentially self-adjoint. For the latter result we use W\"ust's Theorem and an application of Konrady's trick in Fock space. In this more general case we also prove that one has some control over the spectral projections of T, by describing it as the strong graph limit of a sequence of essentially self-adjoint operators.
