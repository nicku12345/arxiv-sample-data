\noindent{\bf Abstract} We establish the long-time asymptotic formula of solutions to the (1+\alpha)--order fractional differential equation {}_{0}^{\>i}{\cal O}_{t}^{1+\alpha}x+a(t)x=0, t>0, under some simple restrictions on the functional coefficient a(t), where {}_{0}^{\>i}{\cal O}_{t}^{1+\alpha} is one of the fractional differential operators {}_{0}D_{t}^{\alpha}(x^{\prime}), ({}_{0}D_{t}^{\alpha}x)^{\prime}={}_{0}D_{t}^{1+\alpha}x and {}_{0}D_{t}^{\alpha}(tx^{\prime}-x). Here, {}_{0}D_{t}^{\alpha} designates the Riemann-Liouville derivative of order \alpha\in(0,1). The asymptotic formula reads as [a+O(1)]\cdot x_{{\scriptstyle small}}+b\cdot x_{{\scriptstyle large}} as t\rightarrow+\infty for given a, b\in\mathbb{R}, where x_{{\scriptstyle small}} and x_{{\scriptstyle large}} represent the eventually small and eventually large solutions that generate the solution space of the fractional differential equation {}_{0}^{\>i}{\cal O}_{t}^{1+\alpha}x=0, t>0.
