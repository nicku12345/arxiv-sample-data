Differential operators on Schwartz distributions conventionally are defined as the transpose of differential operators on functions with compact support. They do not exhaust all differential operators. We follow algebraic formalism of differential operators on modules over commutative rings. In a general setting, Schwartz distributions on sections with compact support of vector bundles over an arbitrary smooth manifold are considered.
