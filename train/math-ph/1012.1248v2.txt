In this paper we consider a generalization of analysis on p-adic numbers field to the m case of m-adic numbers ring. The basic statements, theorems and formulas of p-adic analysis can be used for the case of m-adic analysis without changing. We discuss basic properties of m-adic numbers and consider some properties of m-adic integration and m-adic Fourier analysis. The class of infinitely divisible m-adic distributions and the class of m-adic stochastic Levi processes were introduced. The special class of m-adic CTRW process and fractional-time m-adic random walk as the diffusive limit of it is considered. We found the asymptotic behavior of the probability measure of initial distribution support for fractional-time m-adic random walk.
