A model kinetic equation is constructed for the transport of a massless Bose gas. This equation is applied to solution of the boundary value problem for the transport of radiation in the half-space occupied by a dispersive medium that is in local thermal equilibrium with the radiation. It is shown that the difference in temperature between the dispersive medium and the incident radiation depends substantially on the character of the scattering properties of the particles of the medium.
