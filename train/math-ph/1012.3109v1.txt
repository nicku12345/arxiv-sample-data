We establish soliton-like asymptotics for finite energy solutions to the Dirac equation coupled to a relativistic particle. Any solution with initial state close to the solitary manifold, converges in long time limit to a sum of traveling wave and outgoing free wave. The convergence holds in global energy norm. The proof uses spectral theory and the symplectic projection onto solitary manifold in the Hilbert phase space.
