Recently Ivanov and Skvortsov introduced continuous Dyson-Maleev (DM) representations of supersymmetric non-linear sigma models and motivated that these representations are non-perturbatively exact. Basic to all continuous DM representations of this kind are certain identities for integrals over hermitian (super)symmetric spaces. We establish these basic identities rigorously in the non-super case.
