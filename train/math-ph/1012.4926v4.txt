The purpose of this publication is to derive and discuss equations of motion of affinely rigid (homogeneously deformable) body moving in Euclidean space of general dimension n. Our aim is to present some analytical methods and to discuss geometric structure and invariance properties of the theory. Some perspectives of further developments are also discussed.
