Foundational material on complex Lie supergroups and their radial operators is presented. In particular, Berezin's recursion formula for describing the radial parts of fundamental operators in general linear and ortho-symplectic cases is proved. Local versions of results which are suitable for applications for computing characters which are only defined on proper subdomains or covering spaces thereof are established.
