Q-conditional symmetries of the classical Lotka-Volterra system in the case of one space variable are completely described and a set of such symmetries in explicit form is constructed. The relevant non-Lie ans\"atze to reduce the classical Lotka-Volterra systems with correctly-specified coefficients to ODE systems and examples of new exact solutions are found. A possible biological interpretation of some exact solutions is presented.
