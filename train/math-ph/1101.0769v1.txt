In the present paper we show how to obtain the well-known formula for Gauss sums and the Gauss reciprocity low from the Poison summarizing formula by using some ideas of renormalization and ergodic theories. We also apply our method to obtain new simple derivation of the standard formula for p-adic Gauss integrals.
