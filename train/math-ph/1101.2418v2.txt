Yves Colin de Verdiere's quantization formalism of magnetic bottles on Riemann surfaces of non null genus is shown to be affected, owing to the Homotopy Superselection Rule, by the phenomenon of the existence of multiple inequivalent quantizations mathematically analogous to the phenomenon of the existence of multiple inequivalent prequantizations of a multiply-connected symplectic manifold in the framework of Souriau-Kostant's Geometric Quantization.
