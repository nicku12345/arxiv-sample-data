Properties of four infinite families of special functions of two real variables, based on the compact simple Lie group G2, are compared and described. Two of the four families (called here C- and S-functions) are well known, whereas the other two (S^L- and S^S-functions) are not found elsewhere in the literature. It is shown explicitly that all four families have similar properties. In particular, they are orthogonal when integrated over a finite region F of the Euclidean space, and they are discretely orthogonal when their values, sampled at the lattice points F_M \subset F, are added up with a weight function appropriate for each family. Products of ten types among the four families of functions, namely CC, CS, SS, SS^L, CS^S, SS^L, SS^S, S^SS^S, S^LS^S and S^LS^L, are completely decomposable into the finite sum of the functions. Uncommon arithmetic properties of the functions are pointed out and questions about numerous other properties are brought forward.
