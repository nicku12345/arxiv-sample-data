Recently the authors and J.M. Kress presented a special function recurrence relation method to prove quantum superintegrability of an integrable 2D system that included explicit constructions of higher order symmetries and the structure relations for the closed algebra generated by these symmetries. We applied the method to 5 families of systems, each depending on a rational parameter k, including most notably the caged anisotropic oscillator, the Tremblay, Turbiner and Winternitz system and a deformed Kepler-Coulomb system. Here we work out the analogs of these constructions for all of the associated classical Hamiltonian systems, as well as for a family including the generic potential on the 2-sphere. We do not have a proof in every case that the generating symmetries are of lowest possible order, but we believe this to be so via an extension of our method.
