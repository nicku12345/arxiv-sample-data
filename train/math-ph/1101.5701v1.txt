A dynamical Maxwell system is \begin{align*} & e_t={\rm curl\,} h, \quad h_t=-{\rm curl\,} e &&{\rm in}\,\,\Omega \times (0,T) & e|_{t=0}=0,\,\,\,\,h|_{t=0}=0 &&{\rm in}\,\,\Omega & e_\theta =f &&{\rm in}\,\,\, \partial\Omega \times [0,T] \end{align*} where \Omega is a smooth compact oriented 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary, (\,\cdot\,)_\theta is a tangent component of a vector at the boundary, e=e^f(x,t) and h=h^f(x,t) are the electric and magnetic components of the solution. With the system one associates a response operator R^T: f \mapsto -\nu \wedge h^f|_{\partial\Omega \times (0,T)}, where \nu is an outward normal to \partial\Omega.   The time-optimal setup of the inverse problem, which is relevant to the finiteness of the wave speed propagation, is: given R^{2T} to recover the part \Omega^T:=\{x\in \Omega\,|\,{\rm dist\,}(x,\partial \Omega)<T\} of the manifold. As was shown by Belishev, Isakov, Pestov, Sharafutdinov (2000), for {\it small enough} T the operator R^{2T} determines \Omega^T uniquely up to isometry.   Here we prove that uniqueness holds for {\it arbitrary} T>0 and provide a procedure that recovers {\Omega^T} from R^{2T}. Our approach is a version of the boundary control method (Belishev, 1986).
