We present the supersymmetric Witten and double Darboux (strictly isospectral) constructions as applied to the diffusion of thermal neutrons from an infinitely long line source. While the Witten construction is just a mathematical scheme, the double Darboux method introduces a one-parameter family of diffusion solutions which are strictly isospectral to the stationary solution. They correspond to a Darboux-transformed diffusion length which is flux dependent
