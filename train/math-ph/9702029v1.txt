Einstein equations for several matter sources in Robertson-Walker and Bianchi I type metrics, are shown to reduce to a kind of second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation \ddot{y}+\alpha f(y)\dot{y}+\beta f(y)\int{f(y) dy}+\gamma f(y)=0. Also, it appears in the generalized statistical mechanics for the most interesting value q=-1. The invariant form of this equation is imposed and the corresponding nonlocal transformation is obtained. The linearization of that equation for any \alpha, \beta and \gamma is presented and for the important case f=by^n+k with \beta=\alpha ^2 (n+1)/((n+2)^2) its explicit general solution is found. Moreover, the form invariance is applied to yield exact solutions of same other differential equations.
