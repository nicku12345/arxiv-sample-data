We introduce three "Cayley-Klein" families of Lie algebras through realizations in terms of either real, complex or quaternionic matrices. Each family includes simple as well as some limiting quasi-simple real Lie algebras. Their relationships naturally lead to an infinite family of 3\times 3 Freudenthal-like magic squares, which relate algebras in the three CK families. In the lowest dimensional cases suitable extensions involving octonions are possible, and for N=1, 2, the "classical" 3\times 3 Freudenthal-like squares admit a 4\times 4 extension, which gives the original Freudenthal square and the Sudbery square.
