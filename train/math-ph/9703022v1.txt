This note is devoted to a more detailed description of one of the five simple exceptional Lie superalgebras of vector fields, cvect(0|3)_*, a subalgebra of vect(4|3). We derive differential equations for its elements, and solve these equations. Hence we get an exact form for the elements of cvect(0|3)_*. Moreover we realize cvect(0|3)_* by "glued" pairs of generating functions on a (3|3)-dimensional periplectic (odd symplectic) supermanifold and describe the bracket explicitly.
