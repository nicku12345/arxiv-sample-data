The operator algebras of a new family of relativistic geometric models of the relativistic oscillator are studied. It is shown that, generally, the operator of number of quanta and the pair of the shift operators of each model are the generators of a non-unitary representation of the so(1,2) algebra, except a special case when this algebra becomes the standard one of the non-relativistic harmonic oscillator.
