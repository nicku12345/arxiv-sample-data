The initial value problem for the Ginzburg-Landau-Schr\"odinger equation is examined in the \epsilon \rightarrow 0 limit under two main assumptions on the initial data \phi^\epsilon. The first assumption is that \phi^\epsilon exhibits m distinct vortices of degree \pm 1; these are described as points of concentration of the Jacobian [J\phi^\epsilon] of \phi^\epsilon. Second, we assume energy bounds consistent with vortices at the points of concentration. Under these assumptions, we identify ``vortex structures'' in the \epsilon \rightarrow 0 limit of \phi^\epsilon and show that these structures persist in the solution u^\epsilon(t) of GLS_\epsilon. We derive ordinary differential equations which govern the motion of the vortices in the \epsilon \rightarrow 0 limit. The limiting system of ordinary differential equations is a Hamitonian flow governed by the renormalized energy of Bethuel, Brezis and H\'elein. Our arguments rely on results about the structural stability of vortices which are proved in a separate paper.
