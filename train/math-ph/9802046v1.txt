We present a picture of Lagrangean mechanics, free of some unnatural features (such as complete divergences). As a byproduct, a completely natural U(1)-bundle over the phase space appears. The correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics is very clear, e.g. no topological ambiguities remain. Contact geometry is the basic tool.
