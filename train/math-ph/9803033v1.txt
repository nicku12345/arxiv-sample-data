Mahan [J. Math. Phys. 36, 6758 (1995)] has calculated the transmission coefficient and angular distribution of particles which enter a thick slab at normal incidence and which diffuse in the slab with linear anisotropic, non-absorbing, scattering. Using orthogonality relations derived by McCormick & Kuscer [J. Math. Phys. 6, 1939 (1965); 7, 2036 (1966)] for the eigenfunctions of the problem, this calculation is generalised to a boundary condition with particle input at arbitrary angles. It is also shown how to use the orthogonality relations to relax in a simple way the restriction to a thick slab.
