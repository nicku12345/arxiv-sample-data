Induced representations of Brauer algebra D_{f}(n) from S_{f_{1}}\times S_{f_{2}} with f_{1}+f_{2}=f are discussed. The induction coefficients (IDCs) or the outer-product reduction coefficients (ORCs) of S_{f_{1}}\times S_{f_{2}}\uparrow D_{f}(n) with f\leq 4 up to a normalization factor are derived by using the linear equation method. Weyl tableaus for the corresponding Gel'fand basis of SO(n) are defined. The assimilation method for obtaining CG coefficients of SO(n) in the Gel'fand basis for no modification rule involved couplings from IDCs of Brauer algebra are proposed. Some isoscalar factors of SO(n)\supset SO(n-1) for the resulting irrep [\lambda_{1},~\lambda_{2},~ \lambda_{3},~\lambda_{4},\dot{0}] with \sum\limits_{i=1}^{4}\lambda_{i}\leq .
