We introduce the fuzzy supersphere as sequence of finite-dimensional, noncommutative Z_{2}-graded algebras tending in a suitable limit to a dense subalgebra of the Z_{2}-graded algebra of {\cal H}^{\infty}-functions on the (2| 2)-dimensional supersphere. Noncommutative analogues of the body map (to the (fuzzy) sphere) and the super-deRham complex are introduced. In particular we reproduce the equality of the super-deRham cohomology of the supersphere and the ordinary deRham cohomology of its body on the "fuzzy level".
