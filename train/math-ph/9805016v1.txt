We review several procedures of quantization formulated in the framework of (classical) phase space M. These quantization methods consider Quantum Mechanics as a "deformation" of Classical Mechanics by means of the "transformation" of the commutative algebra of smooth functions on M in a new non-commutative algebra. These ideas lead in a natural way to Quantum Groups as deformation (or quantization, in a broad sense) of Poisson-Lie groups, which is also analysed here.
