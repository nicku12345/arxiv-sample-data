Let {\cal H}(x,\xi) be a holomorphic Hamiltonian of quadratic growth on  R^{2n}, b a holomorphic exponentially localized observable, H, B the corresponding operators on L^2(R^n) generated by Weyl quantization, and U(t)=\exp{iHt/\hbar}. It is proved that the L^2 norm of the difference between the Heisenberg observable B_t=U(t)BU(-t) and its semiclassical approximation of order {N-1} is majorized by K N^{(6n+1)N}(-\hbar ln\hbar)^N for t\in [0,T_N(\hbar)] where T_N(\hbar)=-{2 ln\hbar\over {N-1}}. Choosing a suitable N(\hbar) the error is majorized by C\hbar^{ln|ln\hbar|}, 0\leq t\leq |ln\hbar|/ln|ln\hbar|. (Here K,C are constants independent of N,\hbar).
