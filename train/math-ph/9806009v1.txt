A typical result of the paper is the following. Let H_\gamma=H_0 +\gamma V where H_0 is multiplication by |x|^{2l} and V is an integral operator with kernel \cos< x,y\rang le in the space L_2(R^d). If l=d/2+ 2k for some k= 0,1,..., then the operator H_\gamma has infinite number of negative eigenvalues for any coupling constant \gamma\neq 0. For other values of l, the negative spectrum of H_\gamma is infinite for |\gamma|> \sigma_l where \sigma_l is some explicit positive constant. In the case \pm \gamma\in (0,\sigma_l], the number N^{(\pm)}_l of negative eigenvalues of H_\gamma is finite and does not depend on \gamma. We calculate N^{(\pm)}_l.
