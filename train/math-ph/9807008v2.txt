In order to get the classical analogue of quantum interaction picture in classical symplectic geometric description, the space of solutions of free equations of motion is suggested to replace the phase space in T^{*}Q description or the space of motions in usual classical symplectic geometric description. The way to determine measured values of observables in this scheme is worked out.
