We use isomorphism \varphi between matrix algebras and simple orthogonal Clifford algebras \cl(Q) to compute matrix exponential {e}^{A} of a real, complex, and quaternionic matrix A. The isomorphic image p=\varphi(A) in \cl(Q), where the quadratic form Q has a suitable signature (p,q), is exponentiated modulo a minimal polynomial of p using Clifford exponential. Elements of \cl(Q) are treated as symbolic multivariate polynomials in Grassmann monomials. Computations in \cl(Q) are performed with a Maple package `CLIFFORD'. Three examples of matrix exponentiation are given.
