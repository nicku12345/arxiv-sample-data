Complex numbers enter fundamental physics in at least two rather distinct ways. They are needed in quantum theories to make linear differential operators into Hermitian observables. Complex structures appear also, through Hodge duality, in vector and spinor spaces associated with space-time. This paper reviews some of these notions. Charge conjugation in multidimensional geometries and the appearance of Cauchy-Riemann structures on Lorentz manifolds with a congruence of null geodesics without shear are presented in considerable detail.
