A concept of asymptotic symmetry is introduced which is based on a definition of symmetry as a reducibility property relative to a corresponding invariant ansatz. It is shown that the nonlocal Lorentz invariance of the free-particle Schr\"odinger equation, discovered by Fushchych and Segeda in 1977, can be extended to Galilei-invariant equations for free particles with arbitrary spin and, with our definition of asymptotic symmetry, to many nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. An important class of solutions of the free Schr\"odinger equation with improved smoothing properties is obtained.
