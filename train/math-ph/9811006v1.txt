The Lie symmetry group for 1+1 dimensional relativistic heat-conducting fluid is calculated for two different theories, Eckart and Israel-Stewart and a comparison between the group-invariant solutions has been made. Both fluids were founded to be physical acceptable in the sense that during the evolution of the fluid there are three velocity solutions that are decreasing exponentially for particular choices of the initial conditions.
