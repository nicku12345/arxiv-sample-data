In this paper we are mainly concerned with the study of polarizations (in general of higher-order type) on a connected Lie group with a U(1)-principal bundle structure. The representation technique used here is formulated on the basis of a group quantization formalism previously introduced which generalizes the Kostant-Kirillov co-adjoint orbits method for connected Lie groups and the Borel-Weyl-Bott representation algorithm for semisimple groups. We illustrate the fundamentals of the group approach with the help of some examples like the abelian group R^k and the semisimple group SU(2), and the use of higher-order polarizations with the harmonic oscillator group and the Schr\"{o}dinger group, the last one constituting the simplest example of an anomalous group. Also, examples of infinite-dimensional anomalous groups are briefly considered.
