In terms of the irreducible bases of the group space of the octahedral double group {\bf O'}, an analytic formula is obtained to combine the spin states |j,\mu \rangle into the symmetrical adapted bases, belonging to a given row of a given irreducible representation of {\bf O'}. This method is effective for all double point groups. However, for the subgroups of {\bf O'}, there is another way to obtain those combinations. As an example, the correlations of spin states for the tetrahedral double group {\bf T'} are calculated explicitly.
