We construct approximate solutions to the time--dependent Schr\"odinger equation i \hbar (\partial \psi)/(\partial t) = - (\hbar^2)/2 \Delta \psi + V \psi for small values of \hbar. If V satisfies appropriate analyticity and growth hypotheses and |t|\le T, these solutions agree with exact solutions up to errors whose norms are bounded by C \exp{-\gamma/\hbar}, for some C and \gamma>0. Under more restrictive hypotheses, we prove that for sufficiently small T', |t|\le T' |\log(\hbar)| implies the norms of the errors are bounded by C' \exp{-\gamma'/\hbar^{\sigma}}, for some C', \gamma'>0, and \sigma>0.
