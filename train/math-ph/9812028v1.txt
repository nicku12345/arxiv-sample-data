In this letter, the (q,h)-analogue of Newton's binomial formula is obtained in the (q,h)-deformed quantum plane which reduces for h=0 to the q-analogue. For (q=1,h=0), this is just the usual one as it should be. Moreover, the h-analogue is recovered for q=1. Some properties of the (q,h)-binomial coefficients are also given. This result will contribute to an introduction of the (q,h)-analogue of the well-known functions, (q,h)-special functions and (q,h)-deformed analysis.
