The long time asymptotics of multi-time correlation functions of relaxing quantum mechanical systems can be conveniently studied by means of free-products of suitable C*-algebras and of states on these free products given by multiple temporal averages. In this paper, we study the distribution law of fluctuations of temporal averages in a class of quantized toral automorphisms.
