Symmetry classification of two-body central potentials in a two-particle Schr\"{o}dinger equation in terms of contact transformations of the equation has been investigated. Explicit calculation has shown that they are of the same four different classes as for the point transformations. Thus in this problem contact transformations are not essentially different from point transformations. We have also obtained the detailed algebraic structures of the corresponding Lie algebras and the functional bases of invariants for the transformation groups in all the four classes.
