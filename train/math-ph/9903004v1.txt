We provide the mathematical structure and a simple, transparent and rigorous derivation of the magnons as elementary quasi-particle excitations at low temperatures and in the infinite spin limit for a large class of Heisenberg ferromagnets. The magnon canonical variables are obtained as fluctuation operators in the infinite spin limit. Their quantum character is governed by the size of the magnetization.
