Exact one-electron eigenstates in finite parts of 1D periodic and Fibonacci chains of attractive and repulsive delta potentials are computed and analyzed. Bloch and bound state boundary conditions are related in terms of transfer matrices. Scenarios of positive and negative energy are distinguished. The dependence on the potential strength parameter is analyzed. The scattering matrix is computed. Implications for the interpretation of band germs in quasiperiodic chains are discussed.
