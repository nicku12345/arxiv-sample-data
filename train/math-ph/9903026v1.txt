We construct a general relativity formula for the law of gravity for material bodies. The formula contains three numeric parameters that are to be determined experimentally. If they are chosen from symmetry considerations, then the theory that appears is close to the theory of electrodynamics: the gravitational field is given by two vector fields, one can write the energy-momentum tensor, we give an answer on the question what a gravitational wave is. Going to infinity, this wave carries with it the negative energy.
