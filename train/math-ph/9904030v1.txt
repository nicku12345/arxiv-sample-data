A rigorous algebraic proof of the full finiteness in all orders of perturbation theory is given for the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in a general three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We show the validity of a trace identity, playing the role of a local form of the Callan-Symanzik equation, in all loop orders, which yields the vanishing of the beta-functions associated to the topological mass and gauge coupling constant as well as the anomalous dimensions of the fields.
