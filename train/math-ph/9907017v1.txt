We study the sine-Gordon model in two dimensional space time in two different domains. For beta > 8 pi and weak coupling, we introduce an ultraviolet cutoff and study the infrared behavior. A renormalization group analysis shows that the model is asymptotically free in the infrared. For beta < 8 pi and weak coupling, we introduce an infrared cutoff and study the ultraviolet behavior. A renormalization group analysis shows that the model is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet.
