The flux-across-surfaces theorem establishes a fundamental relation in quantum scattering theory between the asymptotic outgoing state and a quantity which is directly measured in experiments. We prove it for a hamiltonian with a point interaction, using the explicit expression for the propagator. The proof requires only assuptions on the initial state and it covers also the case of zero-energy resonance. We also outline a different approach based on generalized eigenfunctions, in view of a possible extension of the result.
