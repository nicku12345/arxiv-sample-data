We obtain the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of real symmetric tridiagonal matrices as their dimension increases to infinity and whose diagonal and off-diagonal elements asymptotically change with the index n as J_{nt+i nt+i}\sim a_i\phi(n), J_{nt+i nt+i+1}\sim b_i\phi(n), i=0,1,...,t-1, where a_i and b_i are finite, and \phi(n) belongs to a certain class of nondecreasing functions.
