With the aid of a modified similarity transformation we obtained exact energy eigenvalues of the generalized Dirac-Coulomb equation. This equation consists of the time component of the Lorentz 4-vector potential V_v(r)=-A_1/r, and a Lorentz scalar potential V_s(r)=-A_2/r. The transformed radial equations are so simple that their solutions are inferred from the conventional solutions of the Schrodinger equation.
