The shifted-l expansion technique (SLET) has been developed to get eigenvalues of Schrodinger equation in three (3D) and two dimensions (2D). SLET simply consists of 1/\bar{l} as a perturbation parameter, where \bar{l}=l-\beta, \beta is a suitable shift, l is the angular momentum quantum number for 3D-case, l=|m| for the 2D-case, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Unlike the shifted large-N expansion theory (SLNT), SLET seems to be applicable to a wider number of problems of significant interest in physics.
