The basic mathematical framework for super Hilbert spaces over a Grassmann algebra with a Grassmann number-valued inner product is formulated. Super Hilbert spaces over infinitely generated Grassmann algebras arise in the functional Schroedinger representation of spinor quantum field theory in a natural way.
