The pseudoperturbative shifted-l expansion technique (PSLET) is introduced to determine nodeless states of the 2D Schrodinger equation with an arbitrary cylindrically symmetric potentials. Exact energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the 2D Coulomb and harmonic oscillator potentials are reproduced. Moreover, exact energy eigenvalues, compared to those obtained by numerical solution [11], were obtained for the hybrid of the 2D Coulomb and oscillator potentials.
