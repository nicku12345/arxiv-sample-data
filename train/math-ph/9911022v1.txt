The eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian {\cal H}_{N} of N-sites quantum spin chains with elliptic exchange are connected with the double Bloch meromorphic solutions of the quantum continuous elliptic Calogero-Moser problem. This fact allows one to find the eigenvectors via the solutions to the system of highly transcendental equations of Bethe-ansatz type which is presented in explicit form.
