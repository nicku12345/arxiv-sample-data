We study the Hopf algebra structure and the highest weight representation of a multiparameter version of U_{q}gl(2). The commutation relations as well as other Hopf algebra maps are explicitly given. We show that the multiparameter universal {\cal R} matrix can be constructed directly as a quantum double intertwiner, without using Reshetikhin's transformation. An interesting feature automatically appears in the representation theory: it can be divided into two types, one for generic q, the other for q being a root of unity. When applying the representation theory to the multiparameter universal {\cal R} matrix, the so called standard and nonstandard colored solutions R(\mu,\nu; {\mu}', {\nu}') of the Yang-Baxter equation is obtained.
