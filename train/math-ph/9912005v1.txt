We review the recent developments in the spectral theory of discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with potentials generated by substitutions and circle maps. We discuss how occurrences of local repetitive structures allow for estimates of generalized eigenfunctions. Among the recent applications of this general approach are almost sure and uniform results on the absence of eigenvalues as well as continuity of the spectral measures with respect to Hausdorff measures.
