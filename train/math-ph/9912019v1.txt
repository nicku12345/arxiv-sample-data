We compare different analytical and numerical methods for studying the partitions of a finite system into fragments. We propose a new numerical method of exploring the partition space by generating the Markov chains of partitions based on the Metropolis algorithm. The advantages of the new method for the problems where partitions are sampled with non-trivial weights are demonstrated.
