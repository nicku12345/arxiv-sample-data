The evolution of a quantity, described by a function of space and time, relates the first derivative in time of this function to a spatial operator applied to the function. The initial value of the function at time t=0 is given.   The fractional extension of this evolution consists of replacing the first derivative in time by a fractional derivative of order \alpha, 0 < \alpha \le 1.   We give a relationship between the solution of the equation of evolution and the solution of the equation belonging to its fractional extension.
