This article concerns commutative algebras over a field k of characteristic zero which are finite dimensional as vectorspaces, and particularly those of such algebras which are graded. Here the term graded is applied to non-negatively graded algebras A with A_0 reduced and finite dimensional. Thus the trivial grading A=A_0 is only allowed if A is a product of finite field extensions of k. It has been conjectured (G. Corti\~nas, S. Geller, C. Weibel; The Artinian Berger Conjecture. Math. Zeitschrift {\bf 228} 3 (1998) 569-588) that for all finite dimensional algebras A which are not principal ideal algebras (i.e. have at least one nonprincipal ideal), the following submodule of the K\"ahler differentials is nonzero: \bigcap{\ker(\Omega_A @>>>\Omega_B)} Here the intersection is taken over all principal ideal algebras B and all homomorphisms A @>>>B. In this paper we prove that the conjecture holds for both Gorenstein graded and standard graded algebras.
