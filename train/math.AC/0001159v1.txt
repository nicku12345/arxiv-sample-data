We study the local cohomology modules H^i_B(R) for a reduced monomial ideal B in a polynomial ring R=k[X_1,...,X_n]. We consider a grading on R which is coarser than the Z^n-grading such that each component of H^i_B(R) is finite dimensional and we give an effective way to compute these components. Using Cox's description for sheaves on toric varieties, we apply these results to compute the cohomology of coherent sheaves on toric varieties. We give algorithms for this computation which have been implemented in the Macaulay 2 system. We obtain also a topological description for the cohomology of rank one torsionfree sheaves on toric varieties.
