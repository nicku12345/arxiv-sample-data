We investigate similarities between the category of vector spaces and that of polytopal algebras, containing the former as a full subcategory. In Section 2 we introduce the notion of a polytopal Picard group and show that it is trivial for fields. The coincidence of this group with the ordinary Picard group for general rings remains an open question. In Section 3 we survey some of the previous results on the automorphism groups and retractions. These results support a general conjecture proposed in Section 4 about the nature of arbitrary homomorphisms of polytopal algebras. Thereafter a further confirmation of this conjecture is presented by homomorphisms defined on Veronese singularities.   This is a continuation of the project started in our papers "Polytopal linear groups" (J. Algebra 218 (1999), 715--737), "Polytopal linear retractions" preprint, math.AG/0001049) and "Polyhedral algebras, arrangements of toric varieties, and their groups" (preprint, http://www.mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/K-theory/0232/index.html). The higher K-theoretic aspects of polytopal linear objects will be treated in "Polyhedral K-theory" (in preparation).
