We study the derived invariance of the cohomology theories Hoch^*, H^* and HC^* associated to coalgebras over a field. We prove a theorem characterizing derived equivalences. As particular cases, it describes the two following situations: 1) f:C\to D a quasi-isomorphism of differential graded coalgebras, 2) the existence of a "cotilting" bicomodule {}_CT_D. In these two cases we construct a derived-Morita equivalence context, and consequently we obtain isomorphisms Hoch^*(C)\cong\Hoch^*(D) and H^*(C)\cong H^*(D). Moreover, when we have a coassociative map inducing an isomorphism H^*(C)\cong H^*(D) (for example when there is a quasi-isomorphism f:C\to D), we prove that HC^*(C)\cong HC^*(D).
