Let R be a noetherian ring and M a finite R-module. With a linear form \chi on M one associates the Koszul complex K(\chi). If M is a free module, then the homology of K(\chi) is well-understood, and in particular it is grade sensitive with respect to \Im\chi.   In this note we investigate the case of a module M of projective dimension 1 (more precisely, M has a free resolution of length 1) for which the first non-vanishing Fitting ideal \I_M has the maximally possible grade r+1, r=\rank M. Then h=\grade \Im\chi\le r+1 for all linear forms \chi on M, and it turns out that H_{r-i}(K(\chi))=0 for all even i<h and H_{r-i}(K(\chi))\iso \SS^{(i-1)/2}(C) for all odd i<h where \SS denotes symmetric power and C=\Ext_R^1(M,R), in other words, C=\Cok\psi^* for a presentation  0\to F\stackrel{\psi}{\to} G \to M\to 0.  Moreover, if h\le r, then H_{r-h}(K(\chi)) is neither 0 nor isomorphic to a symmetric power of C, so that it is justified to say that K(\chi) is grade sensitive for the modules M under consideration.   We furthermore show that the maximally possible value \grade \Im\chi=r+1 can only occur in two extreme cases: (i) r=1 or (ii) \rank F=1 and r is odd.
