In this paper we prove parts of a conjecture of Herzog giving lower bounds on the rank of the free modules appearing in the linear strand of a graded k-th syzygy module over the polynomial ring. If in addition the module is \mathbb{Z}^n-graded we show that the conjecture holds in full generality. Furthermore, we give lower and upper bounds for the graded Betti numbers of graded ideals with a linear resolution and a fixed number of generators.
