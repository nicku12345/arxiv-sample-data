We construct minimal cellular resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals arising from hyperplane arrangements, matroids and oriented matroids. These are Stanley-Reisner ideals of complexes of independent sets, and of triangulations of Lawrence matroid polytopes. Our resolution provides a cellular realization of Stanley's formula for their Betti numbers. For unimodular matroids our resolutions are related to hyperplane arrangements on tori, and we recover the resolutions constructed by Bayer, Popescu and Sturmfels. We resolve the combinatorial problems posed in their paper by computing Mobius invariants of graphic and cographic arrangements in terms of Hermite polynomials.
