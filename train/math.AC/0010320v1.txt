In his paper "Residues of a Pfaff system relative to an invariant subscheme" in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 352, 2000, 4019-4035, F. Sancho de Salas defines the universal Koszul complex of a module M over a sheaf of rings \mathcal{O} as {\rm Kos}(M)=\Lambda (M)\otimes_{\mathcal{O}}S(M), where \Lambda (M) and S(M) stand for the exterior and symmetric algebras of M, endowed with the usual differential, and he conjectures (Conjecture 2.3.) that {\rm Kos}(M) is always acyclic. We give here an example of a non acyclic Koszul complex {\rm Kos}(M).
