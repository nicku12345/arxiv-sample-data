Given positive integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, and n general points p_i of {\bf CP}^2, bounds are given for the least degree t among plane curves passing through each point p_i with multiplicity at least m_i, and for the least t such that the n multiple points impose independent conditions on curves of degree t, often improving substantially what was previously known. As an application, the Hilbert function (resp., minimal free resolution) is determined for symbolic powers I^{(m)} for the ideal I defining n general points of {\bf CP}^2 for infinitely many m for each square n (resp., for infinitely many m for each even square n). Four graphs are included showing other values of m and n for which results are given.
