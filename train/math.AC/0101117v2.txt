Let X be an n\times m matrix of indeterminates over a field K (of sufficiently large characteristic) and M_t the set of m-minors of X. We consider two objects: (1) the Ress algebra of the polynomial ring K[X] with respect to the ideal I_t generated by M_t, and (2) the A_t subalgebra of K[X] generated by M_t. Note that A_t is tHE coordinate ring of a Grassmannian if t=\min(m,n); also the cases t=1 and t=m-1=n-1 are easily understood, since A_t is a polynomial ring over K in these cases.   For both objects we compute the divisor class group and the canonical class. In particular we determine the Gorenstein rings among the A_t. It turns out that A_t is Gorenstein exactly in the cases listed above and when t(m+n)=mn.   We use initial methods, based on the straightening law and KRS. They can be applied to other types of determinantal ideals, too. We do this explicitly for generic Hankel matrices.
