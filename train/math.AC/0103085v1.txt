The relationship between {\cal D}-modules and free divisors has been studied in a general setting by L. Narv\'aez and F.J. Calder\'on. Using the ideas of these works we prove in this article a duality formula between two {\cal D}-modules associated to a class of free divisors on {\bf C}^n and we give some applications
