It is well known that for a subscheme V in {\mathbb P}^{n} of codimension two, the conditions (1) V is ACM, and (2) V is "licci" (i.e. V is in the liaison class of a complete intersection) are equivalent. In higher codimension, (2) implies (1) but the converse is false. For Gorenstein liaison the analog of (2) is: (2') V is "glicci" (i.e. V is in the Gorenstein liaison class of a complete intersection). It remains true that (2') implies (1) but now the converse is an important open question.   Previously the authors described a mechanism for lifting monomial ideals to reduced unions of linear varieties. We show here that if the monomial ideal is Artinian then the corresponding union is glicci. As a consequence, any Hilbert function that occurs among ACM schemes in fact occurs among glicci schemes. This is not true if we restrict to complete intersection links. We also show that any Cohen-Macaulay Borel-fixed monomial ideal is glicci. As a consequence, all ACM subschemes of projective space are glicci up to flat deformation.
