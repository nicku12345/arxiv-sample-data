In this paper the author provides a generalization of classical linkage, i.e. linkage by a complete intersection, in a different context. Namely she looks at residuals in the scheme theoretic intersection of a rational normal surface or 3-fold with two hypersurfaces of degree a and b. When the scroll is singular a complete intersection of type (a, b) on it may not be Gorenstein, in this case classical linkage, even if suitably generalized, does not apply.   The main purpose of this article is to establish a framework allowing one to find relations between the dimension of some important cohomology groups attached to the two linked schemes. In the last part of the paper the author shows how to apply these results and techniques to the classification of curves C in P^n of degree d and maximal genus G(d, n, s) among those not contained in surfaces of degree less than a certain fixed one s.
