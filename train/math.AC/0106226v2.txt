For a commutative ring R of characteristic p, let \phi : R \to R be the Frobenius homomorphism and let ^{\phi^r}R denote the R-module structure on R defined via the r-th power of the Frobenius. We show that the Tor functor against the Frobenius module, \Tor^R_*(-, {^{\phi^r}}R), is rigid for a certain class of depth zero rings which includes rings that are not complete intersection. We also show that \Tor^R_*(-, {^{\phi^r}}R) is not rigid (non-vacuously) when \depth (R) >0 and r is large enough. This answers a question of Avramov and Miller: does rigidity of \Tor^R_*(-, {^{\phi^r}}R) hold for non-complete intersections?
