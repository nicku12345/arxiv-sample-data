Let k be a field and n > 0. There exists a DG k-module (V,d) and various approximations d + t d_1 + t^2 d_2 + ... + t^n d_n to a differential on V[[t]], one of which is a non-trivial deformation, another is obstructed, and another is unobstructed at order n. The analogous problem in the category of k-algebras in characteristic zero remains a long-standing open question.
