In section 8.3 of our paper "Duality and Flat Base Change on Formal Schemes" (http://arXiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9708006) some important results concerning localization of, and preservation of coherence by, basic duality functors, were based on the false statement that any closed formal subscheme of an open subscheme of the completion P of a relative projective space is an open subscheme of a closed formal subscheme of P. In this note, the said results are provided with solid foundations.
