We generalize a result of Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith (math.AG/0202303), proving that for an arbitrary sequence of zero-dimensional ideals, the multiplicity of the sequence is equal with its volume. This is done using a deformation to monomial ideals. As a consequence of our result, we obtain a formula which computes the multiplicity of an ideal I in terms of the multiplicities of the initial monomial ideals of the powers I^m. We use this to give a new proof of the inequality between multiplicity and the log canonical threshold due to de Fernex, Ein and the author.
