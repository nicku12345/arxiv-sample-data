Criteria are given in terms of certain Hilbert coefficients for the fiber cone F(I) of an m-primary ideal I in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring (R,m) so that it is Cohen-Macaulay or has depth at least dim(R)-1. A version of Huneke's fundamental lemma is proved for fiber cones. S. Goto's results concerning Cohen-Macaulay fiber cones of ideals with minimal multiplicity are obtained as consequences.
