Let Q=k[x_1,..., x_n] be a polynomial ring over a field k with the standard N^n-grading. Let \phi be a morphism of finite free N^n-graded Q-modules. We translate to this setting several notions and constructions that appear originally in the context of monomial ideals. First, using a modification of the Buchsbaum-Rim complex, we construct a canonical complex T_\bullet(\phi) of finite free N^n-graded Q-modules that generalizes Taylor's resolution. This complex provides a free resolution for the cokernel M of \phi when \phi satisfies certain rank criteria. We also introduce the Scarf complex of \phi, and a notion of ``generic'' morphism. Our main result is that the Scarf complex of \phi is a minimal free resolution of M when \phi is minimal and generic. Finally, we introduce the LCM-lattice for \phi and establish its significance in determining the minimal resolution of M.
