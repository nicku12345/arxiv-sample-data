Let R=k[x_1, ..., x_n]/(x_1^d + ... + x_n^d), where k is a field of characteristic p, p does not divide d and n \geq 3. We describe a method for computing the test ideal for these diagonal hypersurface rings. This method involves using a characterization of test ideals in Gorenstein rings as well as developing a way to compute tight closures of certain ideals despite the lack of a general algorithm. In addition, we compute examples of test ideals in diagonal hypersurface rings of small characteristic (relative to d) including several that are not integrally closed. These examples provide a negative answer to Smith's (2000, Comm. in Alg.) question of whether the test id eal in general is always integrally closed.
