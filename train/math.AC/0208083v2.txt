Let R = k[[x_0,...,x_d]]/(f), where k is a field and f is a non-zero non-unit of the formal power series ring k[[x_0,...,x_d]]. We investigate the question of which rings of this form have bounded Cohen--Macaulay type, that is, have a bound on the multiplicities of the indecomposable maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules. As with finite Cohen--Macaulay type, if the characteristic is different from two, the question reduces to the one-dimensional case: The ring R has bounded Cohen--Macaulay type if and only if R is isomorphic to k[[x_0,...,x_d]]/(g+x_2^2+...+x_d^2), where g is an element of k[[x_0,x_1]] and k[[x_0,x_1]]/(g) has bounded Cohen--Macaulay type. We determine which rings of the form k[[x_0,x_1]]/(g) have bounded Cohen--Macaulay type.
