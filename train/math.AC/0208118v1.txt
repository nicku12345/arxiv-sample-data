Let A be an abelian variety over a number field F with End(A/F) commutative. Let S be a subgroup of A(F) and let x be a point of A(F). Suppose that for almost all places v of F the reduction of x modulo v lies in the reduction of S modulo v. In this paper we prove that x must then lie in S + A(F)_tors. This provides a partial answer to a generalization (due to W. Gajda) of the support problem of Erdos.
