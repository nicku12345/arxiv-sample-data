A relationship between coseparable corings and separable non-unital rings is established. In particular it is shown that an A-coring C has an associative A-balanced product. A Morita context is constructed for a coseparable coring with a grouplike element. Biseparable corings are defined, and a conjecture relating them to Frobenius corings is proposed.
