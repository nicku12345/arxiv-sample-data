Taylor presented an explicit resolution for arbitrary monomial ideals.   Later, Lyubeznik found that already a subcomplex defines a resolution. We show that the Taylor resolution may be obtained by repeated application of the Schreyer Theorem from the theory of Grobner bases, whereas the Lyubeznik resolution is a consequence of Buchberger's chain criterion. Finally, we relate Froberg's contracting homotopy for the Taylor complex to normal forms with respect to our Grobner bases and use it to derive a splitting homotopy that leads to the Lyubeznik complex.
