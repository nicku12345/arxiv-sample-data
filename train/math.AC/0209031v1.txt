Motivated by recent works on the genus of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups, here we study the set of filtered \lambda-ring structures over a filtered ring from a purely algebraic point of view. From a global perspective, we first show that this set has a canonical topology compatible with the filtration on the given filtered ring. For power series rings R \llbrack x \rrbrack, where R is between \bZ and \bQ, with the x-adic filtration, we mimic the construction of the Lazard ring in formal group theory and show that the set of filtered \lambda-ring structures over R \llbrack x \rrbrack is canonically isomorphic to the set of ring maps from some ``universal'' ring U to R. From a local perspective, we demonstrate the existence of uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic filtered \lambda-ring structures over some filtered rings, including rings of dual numbers over binomial domains, (truncated) polynomial and powers series rings over torsionfree \bQ-algebras.
