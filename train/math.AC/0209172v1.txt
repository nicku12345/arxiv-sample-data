Mayr and Meyer found ideals J(n,d) (in a polynomial ring in 10n+2 variables over a field k and generators of degree at most d+2) with ideal membership property which is doubly exponential in n. This paper is a first step in understanding the primary decomposition of these ideals: it is proved here that J(n,d) has nd^2 + 20 minimal prime ideals. Also, all the minimal components are computed, and the intersection of the minimal components as well.
