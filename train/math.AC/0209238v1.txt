We demonstrate that the ring of invariants for the natural action of a subgroup G of GL_n(F_q) on a polynomial ring R=K[X_1,...,X_n] need not be F-pure. In these examples G is the symplectic group over a finite field, and the invariant subrings are always complete intersections by the work of Carlisle and Kropholler. These examples are of special interest from the point of view of studying the Frobenius closures and tight closures of ideals as contractions from certain extension rings: they provide instances when the socle element modulo an ideal generated by a system of parameters is forced into the expansion of the ideal to a module-finite extension ring which is a separable (in fact, Galois) extension. This element is also forced into the expanded ideal in a linearly disjoint purely inseparable extension since it is in the Frobenius closure of the ideal.   The second part of this paper studies the alternating group A_n acting on the polynomial ring R by permuting the variables. We determine when the ring of invariants for this action is F-regular.
