For finitely generated modules N \subsetneq M over a Noetherian ring R, we study the following properties about primary decomposition: (1) The Compatibility property, which says that if \ass (M/N)=\{P_1, P_2, ..., P_s\} and Q_i is a P_i-primary component of N \subsetneq M for each i=1,2,...,s, then N =Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap ... \cap Q_s; (2) For a given subset X=\{P_1, P_2, ..., P_r \} \subseteq \ass(M/N), X is an open subset of \ass(M/N) if and only if the intersections Q_1 \cap Q_2\cap ... \cap Q_r= Q_1' \cap Q_2' \cap ... \cap Q_r' for all possible P_i-primary components Q_i and Q_i' of N\subsetneq M; (3) A new proof of the `Linear Growth' property, which says that for any fixed ideals I_1, I_2, ..., I_t of R, there exists a k \in \mathbb N such that for any n_1, n_2, ..., n_t \in \mathbb N there exists a primary decomposition of I_1^{n_1}I_2^{n_2}... I_t^{n_t}M \subset M such that every P-primary component Q of that primary decomposition contains P^{k(n_1+n_2+...+n_t)}M.
