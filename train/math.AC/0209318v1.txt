Let (R,\fm) be a commutative Noetherian local ring. Suppose that M and N are finitely generated modules over R such that M has finite projective dimension and such that \Tor^R_i(M,N)=0 for all i>0. The main result of this note gives a condition on M which is necessary and sufficient for the tensor product of M and N to be a Cohen--Macaulay module over R, provided N is itself a Cohen--Macaulay module.
