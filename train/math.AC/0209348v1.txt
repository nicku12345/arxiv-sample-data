Let R be monomial sub-algebra of k[x_1,...,x_N] generated by square free monomials of degree two. This paper addresses the following question: when is R a complete intersection?   For such a k-algebra we can associate a graph G whose vertices are x_1,...,x_N and whose edges are \{(x_i, x_j) | x_i x_j \in R \}. Conversely, for any graph G with vertices \{x_1,...,x_N\} we define the {\it edge algebra associated with G} as the sub-algebra of k[x_1,...,x_N] generated by the monomials {x_i x_j | (x_i,x_j) \text{is an edge of} G}. We denote this monomial algebra by k[G].   This paper describes all bipartite graphs whose edge algebras are complete intersections.
