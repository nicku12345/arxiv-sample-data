The i-th local cohomology module of a finitely generated graded module M over a standard positively graded commutative Noetherian ring R, with respect to the irrelevant ideal R_+, is itself graded; all its graded components are finitely generated modules over R_0, the component of R of degree 0. This paper is concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of \Ass_{R_0}(H^i_{R_+}(M)_n) as n \to -\infty.   The smallest i for which such study is interesting is the finiteness dimension f of M relative to R_+, defined as the least integer j for which H^j_{R_+}(M) is not finitely generated. Brodmann and Hellus have shown that \Ass_{R_0}(H^f_{R_+}(M)_n) is constant for all n < < 0 (that is, in their terminology, \Ass_{R_0}(H^f_{R_+}(M)_n) is asymptotically stable for n \to -\infty). The first main aim of this paper is to identify the ultimate constant value (under the mild assumption that R is a homomorphic image of a regular ring): our answer is precisely the set of contractions to R_0 of certain relevant primes of R whose existence is confirmed by Grothendieck's Finiteness Theorem for local cohomology.   Brodmann and Hellus raised various questions about such asymptotic behaviour when i > f. They noted that Singh's study of a particular example (in which f = 2) shows that \Ass_{R_0}(H^3_{R_+}(R)_n) need not be asymptotically stable for n \to -\infty. The second main aim of this paper is to determine, for Singh's example, \Ass_{R_0}(H^3_{R_+}(R)_n) quite precisely for every integer n, and, thereby, answer one of the questions raised by Brodmann and Hellus.
