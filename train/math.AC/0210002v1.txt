The aim of this paper is to obtain a uniform bound for a certain class of submodules from the following theorem: Let (R,\frak m) be a local ring, let M be a finite R--module of dimension d\ge 1 and let \frak q be an ideal of R generated by a system of parameters on M. Let N be a submodule of M with \depth M/N\ge d-1. Then \ell(N/\frak qN)\le\ell(M/\frak qM).
