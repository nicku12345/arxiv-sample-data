We present a bounded probability algorithm for the computation of the Chow forms of the equidimensional components of an algebraic variety. Its complexity is polynomial in the length and in the geometric degree of the input equation system defining the variety. In particular, it provides an alternative algorithm for the equidimensional decomposition of a variety.   As an application we obtain an algorithm for the computation of a subclass of sparse resultants, whose complexity is polynomial in the dimension and the volume of the input set of exponents. As a further application, we derive an algorithm for the computation of the (unique) solution of a generic over-determined equation system.
