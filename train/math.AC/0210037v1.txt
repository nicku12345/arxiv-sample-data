Given a homomorphism of commutative noetherian rings \phi: R \to S, Daniel Quillen conjectured in 1970 that if the Andre-Quillen homology functors D_n(S|R,-) vanish for all n \gg 0, then they vanish for all n \ge 3. We prove the conjecture under the additional hypothesis that there exists a homomorphism of rings \psi: S \to R such that \phi\circ\psi=\id_S. More precisely, in this case we show that \psi is complete intersection at \phi^{-1}(\fn) for every prime ideal \fn of S. Using these results, we describe all algebra retracts S\to R\to S for which the S-algebra Tor^R(S,S) is finitely generated.
