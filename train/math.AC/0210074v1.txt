An integral domain R is said to be a splinter if it is a direct summand, as an R-module, of every module-finite extension ring. Hochster's direct summand conjecture is precisely the conjecture that every regular local ring is a splinter. An integral domain containing the rational numbers is a splinter if and only if it is a normal ring, but the notion is more subtle for rings of positive characteristic: F-regular rings are splinters, and Hochster and Huneke proved that the converse is true for Gorenstein rings. We extend their result by showing that Q-Gorenstein splinters of positive characteristic are F-regular.
