In this paper, we investigate some topics around the closed image S of a rational map \lambda given by some homogeneous elements f_1,...,f_n of the same degree in a graded algebra A. We first compute the degree of this closed image in case \lambda is generically finite and f_1,...,f_n define isolated base points in \Proj(A). We then relate the definition ideal of S to the symmetric and the Rees algebras of the ideal I=(f_1,...,f_n) \subset A, and prove some new acyclicity criteria for the associated approximation complexes. Finally, we use these results to obtain the implicit equation of S in case S is a hypersurface, \Proj(A)=\PP^{n-2}_k with k a field, and base points are either absent or local complete intersection isolated points.
