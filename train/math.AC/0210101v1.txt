In this paper we study monomial multiple structures on a linear subspace of codimension two in projective space. We show that these structures determine smooth points in their respective Hilbert schemes, with (smooth) neighbourhoods of two such points intersecting if their Hilbert functions are equal. We generalize a construction for multiple structures on points in the plane to this setting, giving a kind of product of monomial multiple structures.
