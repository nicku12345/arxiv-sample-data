Formulas are obtained in terms of complete reductions for the bigraded components of local cohomology modules of bigraded Rees algebras of 0-dimensional ideals in 2-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings. As a consequence, cohomological expressions for the coefficients of the Bhattacharya polynomial of such ideals are obtained.
