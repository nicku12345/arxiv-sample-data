We introduce a new variant of tight closure associated to any fixed ideal \a, which we call \a-tight closure, and study various properties thereof. In our theory, the annihilator ideal \tau(\a) of all \a-tight closure relations, which is a generalization of the test ideal in the usual tight closure theory, plays a particularly important role. We prove the correspondence of the ideal \tau(\a) and the multiplier ideal associated to \a (or, the adjoint of \a in Lipman's sense) in normal \Q-Gorenstein rings reduced from characteristic zero to characteristic p \gg 0. Also, in fixed prime characteristic, we establish some properties of \tau(\a) similar to those of multiplier ideals (e.g., a Brian\c{c}on-Skoda type theorem, subadditivity, etc.) with considerably simple proofs, and study the relationship between the ideal \tau(\a) and the F-rationality of Rees algebras.
