The eThe existence of common zero of a family of polynomials has led to study of inertial forms whose homogeneous part of degree 0 constitutes the ideal resultant. The Koszul anc Cech cohomology groups play a fundamental role in this study. An analogueous of Hurwitz theorem is given and also we finds a MCoy theorem in a particular case of this study.
