We study higher order determinantal varieties obtained by considering generic m\times n (m \le n) matrices over rings of the form F[t]/(t^k), and for some fixed r, setting the coefficients of powers of t of all r \times r minors to zero. These varieties can be interpreted as generalized tangent bundles over the classical determinantal varieties; a special case of these varieties first appeared in a problem in commuting matrices. We show that when r = m, the varieties are irreducible, but when r < m, these varieties have at least \lfloor {k/2}\rfloor + 1 components. In fact, when r=2 (for any k), or when k=2 (for any r), there are exactly \lfloor {k/2}\rfloor + 1 components. We give formulas for the dimensions of these components in terms of k, m, and n. In the case of square matrices with r=m, we show that the ideals of our varieties are prime and that the coordinate rings are complete intersection rings, and we compute the degree of our varieties via the combinatorics of a suitable simplicial complex.
