In a polynomial ring R with n variables, for every homogeneous ideal I and for every p\leq n we consider the Koszul homology H_i(p,R/I) with respect to a sequence of p of generic linear forms and define the Koszul-Betti number \beta_{ijp}(R/I) of R/I to be the dimension of the degree j part of H_i(p,R/I). In characteristic 0, we show that the Koszul-Betti numbers of any ideal I are bounded above by those of any gin of I and also by those of the Lex-segment of I. We also investigate the set Gins(I) of all the gin of I and show that the Koszul-Betti numbers of any ideal in Gins(I) are bounded below by those of the gin-revlex of I and present examples showing that in general there is no J is Gins(I) such that the Koszul-Betti numbers of any ideal in Gins(I) are bounded above by those of J.
