We introduce perfect resolving algebras and study their fundamental properties. These algebras are basic for our theory of differential graded schemes, as they give rise to affine differential graded schemes. We also introduce etale morphisms. The purpose for studying these, is that they will be used to glue differential graded schemes from affine ones with respect to an etale topology.
