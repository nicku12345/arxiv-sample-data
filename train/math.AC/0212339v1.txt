Let (A,\frak m) be an excellent normal local ring with algebraically closed residue class field. Given integrally closed \frak m-primary ideals I\supset J, we show that there is a composition series between I and J, by integrally closed ideals only. Also we show that any given integrally closed \fm-primary ideal I, the family of integrally closed ideals J\subset I, l_A(I/J)=1 forms an algebraic variety with dimension \dim A -1.
