Recently, I defined a squarefree module over a polynomial ring S = k[x_1, >..., x_n] generalizing the Stanley-Reisner ring k[\Delta] = S/I_\Delta of a simplicial complex \Delta \subset 2^{1, ..., n}. In this paper, from a squarefree module M, we construct the k-sheaf M^+ on an (n-1) simplex B which is the geometric realization of 2^{1, ..., n}. For example, k[\Delta]^+ is (the direct image to B of) the constant sheaf on the geometric realization |\Delta| \subset B.   We have H^i(B, M^+) = [H^{i+1}_m(M)]_0 for all i > 0. The Poincare-Verdier duality for sheaves M^+ on B corresponds to the local duality for squarefree modules over S. For example, if |\Delta| is a manifold, then k[\Delta] is a Buchsbaum ring whose canonical module is a squarefree module giving the orientation sheaf of |\Delta| with the coefficients in k.
