Let D be an integral domain with quotient field K. A star-operation \star on D is a closure operation A \longmapsto A^\star on the set of nonzero fractional ideals, F(D), of D satisfying the properties: (xD)^\star = xD and (xA)^\star = xA^\star for all x \in K^\ast and A \in F(D). Let {\M S} be a multiplicatively closed set of ideals of D. For A \in F(D) define A_{\M S} = \{x \in K \mid xI \subseteq{A}, for some I \in {\M S}\}. Then D_{\M S} is an overring of D and A_{\M S} is a fractional ideal of D_{\M S}. Let {\M S} be a multiplicative set of finitely generated nonzero ideals of D and A \in F(D), then the map A \longmapsto A_{\M S} is a finite character star-operation if and only if for each I \in {\M S}, I_v = D. We give an example to show that this result is not true if the ideals are not assumed to be finitely generated. In general, the map A \longmapsto A_{\M S} is a star-operation if and only if \bar {\M S}, the saturation of {\M S}, is a localizing GV-system. We also discuss star-operations given of the form A \longmapsto \cap AD_\alpha, where D = \cap D_\alpha.
