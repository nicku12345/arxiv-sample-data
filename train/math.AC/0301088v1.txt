Given two curves in \PP^3, either implicitly or by a parameterization, we want to check if they intersect. For that purpose, we present and further develop generalized resultant techniques. Our aim is to provide a closed formula in the inputs which vanishes if and only if the two curves intersect. This could be useful in Computer Aided Design, for computing the intersection of algebraic surfaces.
