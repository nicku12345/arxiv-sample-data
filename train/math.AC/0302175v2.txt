This paper contains a new proof of the classification of elements of prime order in the Cremona group Bir(P^2), up to conjugation. In addition, we give explicit geometric constructions of these Cremona transformations, and provide a parameterization of their conjugacy classes. Analogous constructions in higher dimensions are also discussed.
