Let (R, {\mathfrak m}) be a Noetherian local ring and let I be an R-ideal. Inspired by the work of H\"ubl and Huneke, we look for conditions that guarantee the Cohen-Macaulayness of the special fiber ring {\mathcal F}={\mathcal R}/{\mathfrak m}{\mathcal R} of I, where {\mathcal R} denotes the Rees algebra of I. Our key idea is to require `good' intersection properties as well as `few' homogeneous generating relations in low degrees. In particular, if I is a strongly Cohen-Macaulay R-ideal with G_{\ell} and the expected reduction number, we conclude that {\mathcal F} is always Cohen-Macaulay. We also obtain a characterization of the Cohen-Macaulayness of {\mathcal R}/K{\mathcal R} for any {\mathfrak m}-primary ideal K: This result recovers a well-known criterion of Valabrega and Valla whenever K=I. Furthermore, we study the relationship among the Cohen-Macaulay property of the special fiber ring {\mathcal F} and the one of the Rees algebra {\mathcal R} and the associated graded ring {\mathcal G} of I. Finally, we focus on the integral closedness of {\mathfrak m}I. The latter question is motivated by the theory of evolutions.
