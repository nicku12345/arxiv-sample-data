Multiplier ideals, and the vanishing theorems they satisfy, have found many applications in recent years. In the global setting they have been used to study pluricanonical and other linear series on a projective variety. More recently, they have led to the discovery of some surprising uniform results in local algebra.   The present notes aim to provide a gentle introduction to the algebraically-oriented local side of the theory. They follow closely a short course on multiplier ideals given in September 2002 at the Introductory Workshop of the program in commutative algebra at MSRI.
