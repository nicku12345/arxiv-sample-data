Let (R, \m) be a commutative Noetherian local ring with \m^3 =(0). We give a condition for R to have a non-free module of G-dimension zero. We shall also construct a family of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules of G-dimension zero with parameters in an open subset of projective space. We shall finally show that the subcategory consisting of modules of G-dimension zero over R is not necessarily a contravariantly finite subcategory in the category of finitely generated R-modules.
