A "squarefree module" over a polynomial ring S = k[x_1, .., x_n] is a generalization of a Stanley-Reisner ring, and allows us to apply homological methods to the study of monomial ideals systematically. Let Sq be the category of squarefree modules. Then the derived category D^b(Sq) of Sq has three duality functors which act on D^b(Sq) just like three transpositions of the symmetric group S_3 (up to translation). This phenomenon is closely related to the Koszul dulaity (in particular, the Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand correspondence). We also study the local cohomology module H_{I_\Delta}^i(S) at a Stanley-Reisner ideal I_\Delta using squarefree modules. Among other things, we see that Hochster's formula on the Hilbert function of H_m^i(S/I_\Delta) is also a formula on the characteristic cycle of H_{I_\Delta}^{n-i}(S) as a module over the Weyl algebra S<\partial_1, ..., \partial_n > (if chara(k)=0).
