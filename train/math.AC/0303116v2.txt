We study computational aspects of the tight closure of a homogeneous primary ideal in a two-dimensional normal standard-graded domain. We show how to use slope criteria for the sheaf of syzygies for generators of the ideal to compute the tight closure. Our method gives in particular an algorithm to compute the tight closure of three elements under the condition that we are able to compute the Harder-Narasimhan filtration. We apply this to the computation of (x^a,y^a,z^a)^* in K[x,y,z]/(F), where F is a homogeneous polynomial.
