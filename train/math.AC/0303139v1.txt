In this paper, we ask the following question: what is the minimal value of the difference e_{HK}(I) - e_{HK}(I') for ideals I' \supseteq I with l_A(I'/I) =1? In order to answer to this question, we define the notion of minimal Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity for strongly F-regular rings. Moreover, we calculate this invariant for quotient singularities and for the coordinate ring of the Segre embedding: P^{r-1} \times P^{s-1} \hookrightarrow P^{rs-1}, respectively.
