The strong factorization conjecture states that a proper birational map between smooth algebraic varieties over a field of characteristic zero can be factored as a sequence of smooth blowups followed by a sequence of smooth blowdowns. We prove a local version of the strong factorization conjecture for toric varieties. Combining this result with the monomialization theorem of S.D.Cutkosky, we obtain a strong factorization theorem for local rings dominated by a valuation.
