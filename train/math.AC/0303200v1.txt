A study of the relation between a noetherian local domain with a given valuation and its associated graded ring with respect to the valuation, which in some cases is an esentially toric variety, possibly of infinite embedding dimension, but of finite Krull dimension. After extension of the valuation to a suitable completion (whose existence is not established in the paper) the relation becomes much more precise, and suggests a possible way to establish local uniformization for an excellent equicharacteristic local domain with an algebraically closed residue field, by deforming a partial toric embedded resolution of the essentially toric spectrum of the associated graded ring.
