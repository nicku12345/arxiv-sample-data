It is well known that the multiplier ideal \multr{I} of an ideal I determines in a straightforward way the multiplier ideal \multr{f} of a sufficiently general element f of I. We give an explicit condition on a polynomial f \in \CC[x_1,...,x_n] which guarantees that it is a sufficiently general element of the most natural associated monomial ideal, the ideal generated by its terms. This allows us to directly calculate the multiplier ideal \multr{f} (for all r) of ``most'' polynomials f.
