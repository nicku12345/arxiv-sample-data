We try to understand the behavior of exterior algebraic shifting with respect to basic constructions on simplicial complexes, like union and join. In particular we give a complete combinatorial description of the shifting of a disjoint union, and more generally of a union along a simplex, in terms of the shifting of its components. As a corollary, we prove the following, conjectured by Kalai: \Delta(K \cup L) = \Delta (\Delta(K) \cup \Delta(L)), where K,L are complexes, \cup means disjoint union, and \Delta is the exterior shifting operator. We give an example showing that replacing the operation 'union' with the operation 'join' in the above equation is wrong, disproving a conjecture made by Kalai.   We adopt a homological point of view on the algebraic shifting operator, which is used throughout this work.
