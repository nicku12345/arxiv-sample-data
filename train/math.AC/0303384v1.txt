Let K be a field and S = K[x1,...,xn] be a polynomial ring. A single spot ideal I =< S is a graded ideal whose local cohomology H^i_\mm(S/I), i< dim S/I and \mm = (x1,...,xn), only has non-trivial value N, a finite length module, at i = depth S/I. We consider characterization of single spot ideals in terms of (long) Bourbaki sequences. The codimension 2 case has been fairly well investigated. In this paper, we focus on the codimension 3 case.
