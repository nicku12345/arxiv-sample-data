Our main purpose is to give multiple examples for using the available implementations for computing the normalization of an affine ring, computing the minimial generators of the normalization as an algebra over the original ring and integral closures of ideals. Some such examples have been published for Singular, but not for Macaulay 2 and we present both in this paper. We also briefly describe the implementations.
