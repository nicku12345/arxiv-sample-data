We prove that every place P of an algebraic function field F|K of arbitrary characteristic admits local uniformization, provided that the sum of the rational rank of its value group and the transcendence degree of its residue field FP over K is equal to the transcendence degree of F|K, and the extension FP|K is separable. We generalize this result to the case where P dominates a regular local Nagata ring R\subseteq K of Krull dimension \dim R\leq 2, assuming that the valued field (K,v_P) is defectless, the factor group v_P F/v_P K is torsion-free and the extension of residue fields FP|KP is separable. The results also include a form of monomialization. Further, we show that in both cases, finitely many Abhyankar places admit simultaneous local uniformization on an affine scheme if they have value groups isomorphic over v_P K.
