In the derived category of the category of modules over a commutative Noetherian ring R, we define, for an ideal \fa of R, two different types of cohomological dimensions of a complex X in a certain subcategory of the derived category, namely \cd(\fa, X)=\sup\{\cd(\fa, \H_{\ell}(X))-\ell|\ell\in\Bbb Z\} and -\inf{\mathbf R}\G_{\fa}(X), where \cd(\fa, M)=\sup\{\ell\in\Bbb Z|\H^{\ell}_{\fa}(M)\neq 0\} for an R--module M. In this paper, it is shown, among other things, that, for any complex X bounded to the left, -\inf {\mathbf R}\G_{\fa}(X)\le\cd(\fa, X) and equality holds if indeed \H(X) is finitely generated.
