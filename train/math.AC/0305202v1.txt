We study the "local" behavior of several relevant properties concerning semistar operations, like finite type, stable, spectral, e.a.b. and a.b. We deal with the "global" problem of building a new semistar operation on a given integral domain, by "gluing" a given homogeneous family of semistar operations defined on a set of localizations. We apply these results for studying the local--global behavior of the semistar Nagata ring and the semistar Kronecker function ring. We prove that an integral domain D is a Pr{\"u}fer \star--multiplication domain if and only if all its localizations D_{P} are Pr{\"u}fer \star_P--multiplication domains.
