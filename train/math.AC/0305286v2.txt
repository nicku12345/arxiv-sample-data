We generalize the notions of F-regular and F-pure rings to pairs (R,\a^t) of rings R and ideals \a \subset R with real exponent t > 0, and investigate these properties. These ``F-singularities of pairs'' correspond to singularities of pairs of arbitrary codimension in birational geometry. Via this correspondence, we prove Inversion of Adjunction of arbitrary codimension, which states that for a pair (X,Y) of a smooth variety X and a closed subscheme Y \subsetneq X, if the restriction (Z, Y|_Z) to a normal \Q-Gorenstein closed subvariety Z \subsetneq X is klt (resp. lc), then the pair (X,Y+Z) is plt (resp. lc) near Z.
