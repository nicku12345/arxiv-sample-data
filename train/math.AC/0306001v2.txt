We give counterexamples to the following conjecture of Auslander: given a finitely generated module M over an Artin algebra \Lambda, there exists a positive integer n_M such that for all finitely generated \Lambda-modules N, if \Ext_{\Lambda}^i(M,N)=0 for all i\gg 0, then \Ext_{\Lambda}^i(M,N)=0 for all i\geq n_M. Some of our examples moreover yield homologically defined classes of commutative local rings strictly between the class of local complete intersections and the class of local Gorenstein rings.
