In the first part of the paper we answer (positively) a question raised by the first author which has to do with some sort of rigity of the tail of resolution of an ideal. Let I be a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring over a field of characteristic 0. Denote by \beta_i(I) the i-th Betti number of I and by Gin(I) the revlex generic initial ideal of I. In general one has \beta_i(I)\leq \beta_i(Gin(I)) and we show that if \beta_i(I)=\beta_i(Gin(I)) for some i then \beta_j(I)=\beta_j(Gin(I)) for all j>i.   In the second part of the paper we answer a question of Eisenbud and Huneke. We prove that if I is m-primary and I\subset m^d then \beta_i(m^d)\leq \beta_i(Gin(I)) for all i.
