We study questions around the existence of bounds and the dependence on parameters for linear-algebraic problems in polynomial rings over rings of an arithmetic flavor.In particular, we show that the module of syzygies of polynomials f_1,...,f_n\in R[X_1,...,X_N] with coefficients in a Pr\"ufer domain R can be generated by elements whose degrees are bounded by a number only depending on N, n and the degree of the f_j. This implies that if R is a B\'ezout domain, then the generators can be parametrized in terms of the coefficients of f_1,...,f_n using the ring operations and a certain division function, uniformly in R.
