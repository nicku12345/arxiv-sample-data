The complex moment sequence m(P) is assigned to a univalent polynomial P by the Cauchy transform of the P(D), where D is the unit disk. We establish the representation of the Jacobian det dm(P) in terms of roots of the derivative P'. Combining this result with the special decomposition for the Hurwitz determinants, we prove a formula for the Jacobian which was previously conjectured by C. Ullemar. As a consequence, we show that the boundary of the class of all locally univalent polynomials in U is contained in the union of three irreducible algebraic surfaces.
