In order to understand the deformations of determinants and Pfaffians resulting from deformations of matrices, we study the deformation theory of composites f\circ F, with isolated singularities, where f:Y\to\C has Cohen-Macaulay singular locus and F:X\to Y. We identify the corresponding T^1(F) as (something like) the cohomology of a derived functor, and construct a canonical long exact sequence from which it follows that \tau=\mu(f\circ F)-\beta_0+\beta_1, where \tau is the length of T^1(F) and \beta_i is the length of Tor_i(\O_Y/J_f,\O_X). This explains numerical coincidences observed in lists of simple matrix singularities due to Bruce, Tari, Goryunov, Zakalyukin and Haslinger.
