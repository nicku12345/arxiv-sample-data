Let (R, {\mathfrak m}) be a Noetherian local ring and let I be an {\mathfrak m}-primary ideal. In this paper we give sharp bounds on the multiplicity of the special fiber ring {\mathcal F} of I in terms of other well-known invariants of I. A special attention is then paid in studying when equality holds in these bounds, with a particular interest in the unmixedness or, better, the Cohen-Macaulayness of {\mathcal F}.
