Given p polynomials with coefficients in a commutative unitary integral ring \mathcal{C} containing \mathbb{Q}, we define the notion of a generic Bernstein-Sato polynomial on an irreducible affine scheme V \subset \text{Spec}(\mathcal{C}). We prove the existence of such a non zero rational polynomial which covers and generalizes previous existing results by H. Biosca. When \mathcal{C} is the ring of an algebraic or analytic space, we deduce a stratification of the space of the parameters such that on each stratum, there is a non zero rational polynomial which is a Bernstein-Sato polynomial for any point of the stratum. This generalizes a result of A. Leykin obtained in the case p=1.
