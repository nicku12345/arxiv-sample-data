A certain squarefree monomial ideal H_P arising from a finite partially ordered set P will be studied from viewpoints of both commutative algebra and combinatorics. First, it is proved that the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of H_P possesses a quadratic Gr\"obner basis. Thus in particular all powers of H_P have linear resolutions. Second, the minimal free graded resolution of H_P will be constructed explicitly and a combinatorial formula to compute the Betti numbers of H_P will be presented. Third, by using the fact that the Alexander dual of the simplicial complex \Delta whose Stanley--Reisner ideal coincides with H_P is Cohen--Macaulay, all the Cohen--Macaulay bipartite graphs will be classified.
