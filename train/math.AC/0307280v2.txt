We give explicit generators for ideals of two classes of subspace arrangements embedded in certain reflection arrangements, generalizing results of Li-Li and Kleitman-Lovasz. We also give minimal generators for the ideals of arrangements that arise in a natural way from the p-skeleton of an n-dimensional cube and discuss conditions under which the generators that we give form a Groebner basis.
