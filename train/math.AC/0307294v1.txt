In this paper, we investigate a lower bound (say s_{HK}(p,d)) on Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities for non-regular unmixed local rings of Krull dimension d with characteristic p>0. Especially, we focus three-dimensional local rings. In fact, as a main result, we will prove that s_{HK}(p,3) = 4/3 and that a three-dimensional complete local ring of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity 4/3 is isomorphic to the non-degnerate quadric hyperplanes k[[X,Y,Z,W]]/(X^2+Y^2+Z^2+W^2) under mild conditions. Furthermore, we pose a generalization of the main theorem to the case of \dim A \ge 4 as a conjecture, and show that it is also true in case of \dim A = 4 using the similar method as in the proof of the main theorem.
