A result of Watanabe and Yoshida says that an unmixed local ring of positive characteristic is regular if and only if its Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is one. We show that, for fixed p (characteristic) and d (dimension), there exist a number \epsilon(d,p) > 0 such that any nonregular unmixed ring R has Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity at least 1+\epsilon(d,p). We also show that local rings with sufficiently small Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity are Cohen-Macaulay and F-rational.
