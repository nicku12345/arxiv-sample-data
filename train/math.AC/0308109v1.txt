A normal (respectively, graded normal) vector configuration A defines the toric ideal I_A of a normal (respectively, projectively normal) toric variety. These ideals are Cohen-Macaulay, and when A is normal and graded, I_A is generated in degree at most the dimension of I_A. Based on this, Sturmfels asked if these properties extend to initial ideals -- when A is normal, is there an initial ideal of I_A that is Cohen-Macaulay, and when A is normal and graded, does I_A have a Gr\"obner basis generated in degree at most dim(I_A) ? In this paper, we answer both questions positively for \Delta-normal configurations. These are normal configurations that admit a regular triangulation \Delta with the property that the subconfiguration in each cell of the triangulation is again normal. Such configurations properly contain among them all vector configurations that admit a regular unimodular triangulation. We construct non-trivial families of both \Delta-normal and non-\Delta-normal configurations.
