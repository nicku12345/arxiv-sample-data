For a commutative ring R with an ideal I, generated by a finite regular sequence, we construct differential graded algebras which provide R-free resolutions of I^s and of R/I^s for s>0 and which generalise the Koszul resolution. We derive these from a certain multiplicative double complex. By means of a Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence we express Tor_*^R(R/I,R/I^s) and Tor_*^R(R/I, I^s) in terms of exact sequences and find that they are free as R/I-modules. Except for R/I, their product structure turns out to be trivial; instead, we consider an exterior product. The paper is based on ideas by Andrew Baker; it is written in view of applications to algebraic topology.
