Given a local Noetherian ring (R, {\mathfrak m}) of dimension d>0 and infinite residue field, we study the invariants (dimension and multiplicity) of the Sally module S_J(I) of any {\mathfrak m}-primary ideal I with respect to a minimal reduction J. As a by-product we obtain an estimate for the Hilbert coefficients of {\mathfrak m} that generalizes a bound established by J. Elias and G. Valla in a local Cohen-Macaulay setting. We also find sharp estimates for the multiplicity of the special fiber ring {\mathcal F}(I), which recover previous bounds established by C. Polini, W.V. Vasconcelos and the author in the local Cohen-Macaulay case. Great attention is also paid to Sally modules in local Buchsbaum rings.
