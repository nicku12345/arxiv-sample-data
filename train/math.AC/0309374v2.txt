Let P_1,...,P_n be generic homogeneous polynomials in n variables of degrees d_1,...,d_n respectively. We prove that if \nu is an integer satisfying {\sum_{i=1}^n d_i}-n+1-\min\{d_i\}<\nu, then all multivariate subresultants associated to the family P_1,...,P_n in degree \nu are irreducible. We show that the lower bound is sharp. As a byproduct, we get a formula for computing the residual resultant of \binom{\rho-\nu +n-1}{n-1} smooth isolated points in \PP^{n-1}.
