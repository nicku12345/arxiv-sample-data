In this paper, we study superficial elements of an ideal with respect to a module from a geometrical point of view, using blowing-ups. The notion of weak transform is particularly relevant to this study. We use this viewpoint to get a simple proof of a theorem by D. Kirby characterizing those superficial elements. We also indicate how the same result may be algebraically derived from a more recent theorem of Flenner and Vogel.
