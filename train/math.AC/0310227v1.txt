For a reduced F-finite ring R of characteristic p >0 and q=p^e one can write R^{1/q} = R^{a_q} \oplus M_q, where M_q has no free direct summands over R. We investigate the structure of F-finite, F-pure rings R by studying how the numbers a_q grow with respect to q. This growth is quantified by the splitting dimension and the splitting ratios of R which we study in detail. We also prove the existence of a special prime ideal P(R) of R, called the splitting prime, that has the property that R/P(R) is strongly F-regular. We show that this ideal captures significant information with regard to the F-purity of R.
