In this article we associate to every lattice ideal I_{L,\rho}\subset K[x_1,..., x_m] a cone \sigma  and a graph G_{\sigma} with vertices the minimal generators of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of \sigma . To every polynomial F we assign a subgraph G_{\sigma}(F) of the graph G_{\sigma}. Every expression of the radical of I_{L,\rho}, as a radical of an ideal generated by some polynomials F_1,..., F_s gives a spanning subgraph of G_{\sigma}, the \cup_{i=1}^s G_{\sigma}(F_i). This result provides a lower bound for the minimal number of generators of I_{L,\rho} and therefore improves the generalized Krull's principal ideal theorem for lattice ideals. But mainly it provides lower bounds for the binomial arithmetical rank and the A-homogeneous arithmetical rank of a lattice ideal. Finally we show, by a family of examples, that the bounds given are sharp.
