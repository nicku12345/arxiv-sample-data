Let T be a complete local ring and C a finite set of incomparable prime ideals of T. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for T to be the completion of an integral domain whose generic formal fiber is semilocal with maximal ideals the elements of C. In addition, if char T = 0, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for T to be the completion of an excellent integral domain whose generic formal fiber is semilocal with maximal ideals the elements of C.
