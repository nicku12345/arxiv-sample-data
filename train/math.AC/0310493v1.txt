The Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity \reg(I) is one of the most important invariants of a homogeneous ideal I in a polynomial ring. A basic question is how the regularity behaves with respect to taking powers of ideals. It is known that in the long-run \reg(I^k) is a linear function of k.   We show that in the short-run the regularity of I^k can be quite "irregular". For any given integer d>1 we construct an ideal J generated by d+5 monomials of degree d+1 in 4 variables such that \reg(J^k)=k(d+1) for every k<d and \reg(J^d)\geq d(d+1)+d-1.
