We study the quotient complex \Delta (B_{lm})/S_l\wr S_m as a means of deducing facts about the ring k[x_1,..., x_{lm}]^{S_l\wr S_m}. It is shown in [He] that this quotient complex is shellable when l=2, implying Cohen-Macaulayness of k[x_1,..., x_{2m}]^{S_2\wr S_m} for any field k. We now confirm for all pairs (l,m) with l>2 and m>1 that this quotient complex is not Cohen-Macaulay over \integ /2\integ , but it is Cohen-Macaulay over fields of characteristic p>m (independent of l). This yields corresponding characteristic-dependent results for the ring of invariants k[x_1,..., x_{lm}]^{S_l\wr S_m}. We also prove that this quotient complex and the links of many of its faces are collapsible, and we give a partitioning for this quotient complex.
