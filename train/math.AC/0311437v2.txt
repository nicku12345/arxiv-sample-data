This note intended to give a counterexample to a question related to the following theorem. Let D be a differential domain finitely generated over a differential field F with algebraically closed field of constants,C, of characteristic 0. If D has no nonzero proper differential ideals, then the differential constants of the quotient field of D is also C. The converse is known to be false but the question of whether the differential domain D can be finitely extended within its quotient field to a differential domain with no nonzero proper differential ideals has been raised. A counterexample in the case that F is infinitely generated over C has appeared. This paper intended to give a counterexample in the case where F = C negating the natural question whether adding the condition that F be finitely generated over C is sufficient to guarantee a positive answer to the question. The question is still open.
