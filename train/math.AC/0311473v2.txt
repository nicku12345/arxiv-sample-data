We prove a version of Knebusch's Norm Principle for finite \'etale extensions of semi-local Noetherian domains with infinite residue fields of characteristic different from 2. As an application we prove Grothendieck's conjecture on principal homogeneous spaces for the spinor group of a quadratic space.
