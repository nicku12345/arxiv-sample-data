This note is an attempt to relate explicitly the geometric and algebraic properties of a space curve that is contained in some double plane. We show in particular that the minimal generators of the homogeneous ideal of such a curve can be written in a very specific form. As applications we characterize the possible Hartshorne-Rao modules of curves in a double plane and the minimal curves in their even Liaison classes.
