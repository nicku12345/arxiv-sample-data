Let R_0 be any domain, let R=R_0[U_1, ..., U_s]/I, where U_1, ..., U_s are indeterminates of some positive degrees, and I\subset R_0[U_1, ..., U_s] is a homogeneous ideal.   The main theorem in this paper is states that all the associated primes of H:=H^s_{R_+}(R) contain a certain non-zero ideal c(I) of R_0 called the ``content'' of I. It follows that the support of H is simply V(\content(I)R + R_+) (Corollary 1.8) and, in particular, H vanishes if and only if c(I) is the unit ideal.   These results raise the question of whether local cohomology modules have finitely many minimal associated primes-- this paper provides further evidence in favour of such a result.   Finally, we give a very short proof of a weak version of the monomial conjecture based on these results.
