Using the Frobenius map, we introduce a new invariant for a pair (R,\a) of a ring R and an ideal \a \subset R, which we call the F-pure threshold \mathrm{c}(\a) of \a, and study its properties. We see that the F-pure threshold characterizes several ring theoretic properties. By virtue of Hara and Yoshida's result, the F-pure threshold \mathrm{c}(\a) in characteristic zero corresponds to the log canonical threshold \mathrm{lc}(\a) which is an important invariant in birational geometry. Using the F-pure threshold, we prove some ring theoretic properties of three-dimensional terminal singularities of characteristic zero. Also, in fixed prime characteristic, we establish several properties of F-pure threshold similar to those of the log canonical threshold with quite simple proofs.
