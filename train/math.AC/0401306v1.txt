This article outgrew from an effort to understand our basic question: Are the annihilators of the non-zero Koszul homology modules H_i of an unmixed ideal I contained in the integral closure \bar{I} of I? We also obtain some variations on a result of Burch, which continue the theme of the paper in that they deal with annihilators of homology and integrally closed ideals.
