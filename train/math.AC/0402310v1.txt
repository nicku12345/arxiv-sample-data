Let R be commutative Noetherian ring and let \fa be an ideal of R. For complexes X and Y of R--modules we investigate the invariant \inf{\mathbf R}\Gamma_{\fa}({\mathbf R}\Hom_R(X,Y)) in certain cases. It is shown that, for bounded complexes X and Y with finite homology, \dim Y\le\dim{\mathbf R}\Hom_R(X,Y)\le\pd X+\dim(X\otimes^{\mathbf L}_RY)+\sup X which strengthen the Intersection Theorem. Here \inf X and \sup X denote the homological infimum, and supremum of the complex X, respectively.
