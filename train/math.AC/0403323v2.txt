A classical result from 1861 due to Hermite says that every separable equation of degree 5 can be transformed into an equation of the form x^5 + b x^3 + c x + d = 0. Later this was generalized to equations of degree 6 by Joubert. We show that both results can be understood as an explicit analysis of certain covariants of the symmetric groups S_5 and S_6. In case of degree 5, the classical invariant theory of binary forms of degree 5 comes into play whereas in degree 6 the existence of an outer automorphism of S_6 plays an essential role.
