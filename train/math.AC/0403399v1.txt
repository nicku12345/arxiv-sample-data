Let A=\oplus_{i\in \nn}A_i be an excellent homogeneous Noetherian graded ring and let M=\oplus_{n\in \zz}M_n be a finitely generated graded A-module. We consider M as a module over A_0 and show that the (S_k)-loci of M are open in \Spec(A_0). In particular, the Cohen-Macaulay locus U^0_{CM}=\{\p\in \Spec(A_0) \mid M_\p {is Cohen-Macaulay}\} is an open subset of \Spec(A_0). We also show that the (S_k)-loci on the homogeneous parts M_n of M are eventually stable. As an application we obtain that for a finitely generated Cohen-Macaulay module M over an excellent ring A and for an ideal I\subseteq A which is not contained in any minimal prime of M the (S_k)-loci for the modules M/I^nM are eventually stable.
