We derive two consequences of the multivariate fundamental theorem of algebra (MFTA). The first one is the Bezout theorem for n polynomials. Notably the intersection multiplicities, as in MFTA, are characterized just by means of partial differential operators given by polynomials from D-invariant linear spaces. The second consequence provides a solution to the ideal membership problem, based on the above characterization of intersection multiplicities. Let us mention that one readily gets Nullstellensatz from here.
