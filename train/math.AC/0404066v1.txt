Let R be a d-dimensional standard graded ring over an Artin local ring. Let M be the unique maximal homogeneous ideal of R. Let h^i(R)_n denote the length of H^i_M(R)_n, i.e. the nth graded component of the ith local cohomology module of R with respect to M. Define the Eisenbud-Goto invariant of R to be the number   EG(R)= \sum_{q=0}^{d-1} \binom{d-1}{q} h^q(R)_{1-q}.   We prove that the a-invariant of R satisfies    a(R) \leq e(R)-length(R_1)+(d-1)(length(R_0)-1)+ EG(R).   Using this bound we get upper bounds for the reduction number of an m-primary ideal of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring (R,m) whose associated graded ring G(m) has almost maximal depth.
