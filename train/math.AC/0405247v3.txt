The Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a graded ring is an important invariant in computational commutative algebra, and there is increasing interest in multigraded generalizations. We study connections between two recent definitions of multigraded regularity with a view towards a better understanding of the multigraded Hilbert function of fat point schemes in P^{n_1} x ... x P^{n_k}.
