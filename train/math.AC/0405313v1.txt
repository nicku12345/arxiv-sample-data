Consider the diagonal action of the projective group \PGL_3 on n copies of {\mathbb P}^2. In addition, consider the action of the symmetric group \Sigma_n by permuting the copies. In this paper we find a set of generators for the invariant field of the combined group \Sigma_n \times \PGL_3. As the main application, we obtain a reconstruction principle for point configurations in {\mathbb P}^2 from their sub-configurations of five points. Finally, we address the question of how such reconstruction principles pass down to subgroups.
