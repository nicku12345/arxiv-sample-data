Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, and let I\subset R be an ideal with minimal reduction J. In this paper we attach to the pair I, J a non-standard bigraded module \Sigma^{I,J}.   The study of the bigraded Hilbert function of \SIJ allows us to prove a improved version of Wang's conjecture and a weak version of Sally's conjecture, both on the depth of the associated graded ring gr_I(R). The module \SIJ can be considered as a refinement of the Sally's module previously introduced by W. Vasconcelos.
