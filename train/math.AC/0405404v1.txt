The classical theorem of Weitzenboeck states that the algebra of invariants of a single unipotent transformation g in GL_m(K) acting on the polynomial algebra K[x_1,...,x_m] over a field K of characteristic 0 is finitely generated. Recently the author and C.K. Gupta have started the study of the algebra of g-invariants of relatively free algebras of rank m in varieties of associative algebras. They have shown that the algebra of invariants is not finitely generated if the variety contains the algebra UT_2(K) of 2\times 2 upper triangular matrices. The main result of the present paper is that the algebra of invariants is finitely generated if and only if the variety does not contain the algebra UT_2(K). As a by-product of the proof we have established also the finite generation of the algebra of g-invariants of the mixed trace algebra generated by m generic n\times n matrices and the traces of their products.
