Let I denote an R_+ -primary homogeneous ideal in a normal standard-graded Cohen-Macaulay domain over a field of positive characteristic p. We give a linear degree bound for the Frobenius powers I^[q] of I, q=p^e, in terms of the minimal slope of the top-dimensional syzygy bundle on the projective variety Proj R. This provides an inclusion bound for tight closure. In the same manner we give a linear bound for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the Frobenius powers I^[q].
