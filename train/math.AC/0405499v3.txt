Let \mathfrak{a} be an ideal of Noetherian ring R and let M be an R-module such that \mathrm{Ext}^i_R(R/\mathfrak{a},M) is finite R-module for every i. If s is the first integer such that the local cohomology module \mathrm{H}^s_\mathfrak{a}(M) is non \mathfrak{a}-cofinite, then we show that \mathrm{Hom}_{R}(R/\mathfrak{a}, \mathrm{H}^s_\mathfrak{a}(M)) is finite. Specially, the set of associated primes of \mathrm{H}^s_\mathfrak{a}(M) is finite.   Next assume (R,\mathfrak{m}) is a local Noetherian ring and M is a finitely generated module. We study the last integer n such that the local cohomology module \mathrm{H}^n_\mathfrak{a}(M) is not \mathfrak{m}-cofinite and show that n just depends on the support of M.
