Let I be an m-primary ideal of a Noetherian local ring (R,m). We consider the Gorenstein and complete intersection properties of the associated graded ring G(I) and the fiber cone F(I) of I as reflected in their defining ideals as homomorphic images of polynomial rings over R/I and R/m respectively. In case all the higher conormal modules of I are free over R/I, we observe that: (i) G(I) is Cohen-Macaulay iff F(I) is Cohen- Macaulay, (ii) G(I) is Gorenstein iff both F(I) and R/I are Gorenstein, and (iii) G(I) is a relative complete intersection iff F(I) is a relative complete intersection. In case R/I is Gorenstein, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for G(I) to be Gorenstein in terms of residuation of powers of I with respect to a reduction J of I with \mu(J) = dim R and the reduction number r of I with respect to J. We prove that G(I) is Gorenstein iff J:I^{r-i} = J + I^{i+1}, for i = 0, ...,r-1. If (R,m) is a Gorenstein local ring and I \subseteq m is an ideal having a reduction J with reduction number r such that \mu(J) = ht(I) = g > 0, we prove that the extended Rees algebra R[It, t^-1}] is quasi-Gorenstein with \a-invariant a if and only if J^n:I^r = I^{n+a-r+g-1} for every integer n.
