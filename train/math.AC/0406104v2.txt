We show that certain naturally arising cones over the main component of a moduli space of J_0-holomorphic maps into P^n have a well-defined euler class. We also prove that this is the case if the standard complex structure J_0 on P^n is replaced by a nearby almost complex structure J. The genus-zero analogue of the cone considered in this paper is always a vector bundle. The genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariant of a projective hypersurface is the euler class of such a vector bundle. As shown in a separate paper, this is also the case for the "genus-one part" of the genus-one GW-invariant. The remaining part is a multiple of the genus-zero GW-invariant.
