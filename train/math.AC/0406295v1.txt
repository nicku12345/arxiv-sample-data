Call a domain R an sQQR-domain if each simple overring of R, i.e., each ring of the form R[u] with u in the quotient field of R, is an intersection of localizations of R. We characterize Pr\"ufer domains as integrally closed sQQR-domains. In the presence of certain finiteness conditions, we show that the sQQR-property is very strong; for instance, a Mori sQQR-domain must be a Dedekind domain. We also show how to construct sQQR-domains which have (non-simple) overrings which are not intersections of localizations.
