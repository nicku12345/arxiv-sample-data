Let A be the ring obtained by localizing the polynomial ring k[X,Y,Z,W] over a field k at the maximal ideal (X,Y,Z,W) and modulo the ideal (XW-YZ). Let p be the ideal of A generated by X and Y. We study the module structure of a minimal injective resolution of A/p in details using local cohomology. Applications include the description of Ext^i(M,A/p), where M is a module constructed by Dutta, Hochster and McLaughlin, and the Yoneda product of Ext^*(A/p,A/p).
