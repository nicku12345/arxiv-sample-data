In this paper we answer a question posed by Horikawa in 1978, who showed that the above moduli space is composed of 11 locally closed strata building up 4 irreducible components and having at most 3 connected components. We prove that the number of connected components is at most two and pose the question whether this number is exactly two. The main new idea is to analyse the strata in the moduli space where the canonical divisor is 2-divisible on the canonical model (as a Weil divisor). In this way we obtain a semicanonical ring \B which is a Gorenstein ring of codimension 4 for type III_b and of codimension 1 for type II. We use one of the formats introduced by Dicks and Reid for Gorenstein rings of codimension 4, the one of 4x4 Pfaffians of antisymmetric extrasymmetric 6x6 matrices.
