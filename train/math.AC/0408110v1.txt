Let R=K[M] be a normal affine monoid algbera over a field K.Up to isomorphism the conic ideals are exactly the direct summands ofthe extension R^{1/n} of R. We show that the classes of the conic divisorial ideals can be identified with the full-dimensional open cells in a decomposition of a torus naturally associated with M. Furthermore, they can be characterized by the relative compactness of a certain group associated with them.   Baetica has given examples of Cohen-Macaulay divisorial ideals that are not conic. Wereview his construction and streamline the arguments somewhat.   In the last part of the paper we investigate the multiplicities ofthe conic classes in the decomposition of R^{1/n} as a function of n.This multiplicity turns out to be a quasi-polynomial for all n >= 1 counting the lattice points in the union of the interiors of certain cells of the complex mentioned above. This argument can be used for the computation of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of R in characteristic p > 0. In addition it yields some assertions about the Hilbert-Kunz function of R.
