In this short note I give an alternative proof of a generalization of the result in math.AC/0407464. Namely I show that for most regular rings R, the localization R[1/f] at an element f of R is generated as a module over the ring of differential operators of R by 1/f itself. Due to the greater generality this answers some questions raised in math.AC/0407464. Some further generalizations and a brief discussion of the main technique (Frobenius descent) are also included.
