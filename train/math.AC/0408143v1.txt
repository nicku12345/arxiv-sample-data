Results are presented concerning the following question: If M is a finitely-generated module with finite local cohomologies over a Noetherian local ring (A, m), does there exist an integer n such that every parameter ideal for M contained in m^n has the same index of reducibility? We show that the answer is yes if M has dimension 1 or if M has dimension 2 and positive depth. This research is closely related to work of Goto-Suzuki and Goto-Sakurai; Goto-Sakurai have supplied an answer of yes in case M is Buchsbaum.
