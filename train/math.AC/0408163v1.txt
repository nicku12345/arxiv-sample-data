Let \fa denote an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring R and M and N two finitely generated R-modules with \pd M< \infty. It is shown that if \fa is principal or R is complete local and \fa a prime ideal with \dim R/\fa=1, then the generalized local cohomology module H^i_{\fa}(M,N) is \fa-cofinite for all i \geq 0. This provides an affirmative answer for the above ideal \fa to a question proposed in [{\bf 13}].
