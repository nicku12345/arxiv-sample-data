We obtain two new algorithms for partial fraction decompositions; the first is over algebraically closed fields, and the second is over general fields. These algorithms takes O(M^2) time, where M is the degree of the denominator of the rational function. The new algorithms use less storage space, and are suitable for parallel programming. We also discuss full partial fraction decompositions.
