Two formulas for the multiplicity of the fiber cone F(I)=\oplus_{n=0}^{\infty} I^n/\m I^n of an \m-primary ideal of a d-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring (R,\m) are derived in terms of the mixed multiplicity e_{d-1}(\m | I), the multiplicity e(I) and superficial elements. As a consequence, the Cohen-Macaulay property of F(I) when I has minimal mixed multiplicity or almost minimal mixed multiplicity is characterized in terms of reduction number of I and lengths of certain ideals. We also characterize Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein property of fiber cones of \m-primary ideals with a d-generated minimal reduction J satisfying (i) \ell(I^2/JI)=1 or (ii) \ell(I\m/J\m)=1.
