In this paper, we will give some geometric results using generic initial ideals for the degree reverse lex order. The first application is to the regularity of a Cohen-Macaulay algebra, and we improve a well-known bound. The main goal of the paper, though, is to improve on results of Bigatti, Geramita and Migliore concerning geometric consequences of maximal growth of the Hilbert function of the Artinian reduction of a set of points. When the points have the Uniform Position Property, the consequences they gave are even more striking. Here we weaken the growth condition, assuming only that the values of the Hilbert function of the Artinian reduction are equal in two consecutive degrees, and that the first of these degrees is greater than the second reduction number of the points. We continue to get nice geometric consequences even from this weaker assumption. However, we have surprising examples to show that imposing the Uniform Position Property on the points does not give the striking consequences that one might expect. This leads to a better understanding of the Hilbert function, and the ideal itself, of a set of points with the Uniform Position Property, which is an important open question. In the last section we describe the role played by the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP) in this theory, and we show that the general hyperplane section of a smooth curve may fail to have WLP.
