We prove that the F-signature of an affine semigroup ring of positive characteristic is always a rational number, and describe a method for computing this number. We use this method to determine the F-signature of Segre products of polynomial rings, and of Veronese subrings of polynomial rings. Our technique involves expressing the F-signature of an affine semigroup ring as the difference of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities of two monomial ideals, and then using Watanabe's result that these Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities are rational numbers.
