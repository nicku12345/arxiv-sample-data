In this paper, we establish a residue theorem for Malcev-Neumann series that requires few constraints, and includes previously known combinatorial residue theorems as special cases. Our residue theorem identifies the residues of two formal series that are related by a change of variables. We obtain simple conditions for when a change of variables is possible, and find that the two related formal series in fact belong to two different fields of Malcev-Neumann series. The multivariate Lagrange inversion formula is easily derived and Dyson's conjecture is given a new proof and generalized.
