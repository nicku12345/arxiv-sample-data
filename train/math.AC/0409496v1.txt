We propose a concept of module liaison that extends Gorenstein liaison of ideals and provides an equivalence relation among unmixed modules over a commutative Gorenstein ring. Analyzing the resulting equivalence classes we show that several results known for Gorenstein liaison are still true in the more general case of module liaison. In particular, we construct two maps from the set of even liaison classes of modules of fixed codimension into stable equivalence classes of certain reflexive modules. As a consequence, we show that the intermediate cohomology modules and properties like being perfect, Cohen-Macaulay, Buchsbaum, or surjective-Buchsbaum are preserved in even module liaison classes. Furthermore, we prove that the module liaison class of a complete intersection of codimension one consists of precisely all perfect modules of codimension one.
