After the introduction in 1994, by Okabe and Matsuda, of the notion of semistar operation, many authors have investigated different aspects of this general and powerful concept. A natural development of the recent work in this area leads to investigate the concept of invertibility in the semistar setting. In this paper, we will show the existence of a ``theoretical obstruction'' for extending many results, proved for star-invertibility, to the semistar case. For this reason, we will introduce two distinct notions of invertibility in the semistar setting (called \star--invertibility and quasi--\star--invertibility), we will discuss the motivations of these ``two levels'' of invertibility and we will extend, accordingly, many classical results proved for the d--, v--, t-- and w-- invertibility.
