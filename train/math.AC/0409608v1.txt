We study how solid closure in mixed characteristic behaves after taking ultraproducts. The ultraproduct will be chosen so that we land in equal characteristic, and therefore can make a comparison with tight closure. As a corollary we get an asymptotic version of the Hochster-Roberts invariant theorem in dimension three: if R is a mixed characteristic (cyclically) pure 3-dimensional local subring of a regular local ring S, then R is Cohen-Macaulay, provided the ramification of S is large with respect to its dimension and residual characteristic, and with respect to the multiplicity of R.
