Parametric Gr\"obner bases have been studied for more than 15 years and are now a further developed subject. Here we propose a general study of parametric standard bases, that is with local orders. We mainly focus on the commutative case but we also treat the case of differential operators rings. We will be concerned by two aspects: a theoretical aspect with existence theorems and a practical aspect devoted to how we can explicitely compute such objects when the given data are algebraic. We believe that parametric standard bases are important for both aspects. From a theoretical point of view, they constitute a strong tool for proving constructive results. From a practical one, they provide a tool for studying explicitely local objects associated with parametric algebraic ideals.
