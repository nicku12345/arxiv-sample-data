We study properties of a poset generating a Cohen-Macaulay algebra with straightening laws (ASL for short). We show that if a poset P generates a Cohen-Macaulay ASL, then P is pure and, if P is moreover Buchsbaum, then P is Cohen-Macaulay. Some results concerning a Rees algebra of an ASL defined by a straightening closed ideal are also established. And it is shown that if P is a Cohen-Macaulay poset with unique minimal element and Q is a poset ideal of P, then P\uplus Q is also Cohen-Macaulay.
