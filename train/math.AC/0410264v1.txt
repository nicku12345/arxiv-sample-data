Let I_M and I_N be defining ideals of toric varieties such that I_M is a projection of I_N, i.e. I_N \subseteq I_M. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality I_M=rad(I_N+(f_1,...,f_s)), where f_1,...,f_s belong to I_M. Also a method for finding toric varieties which are set-theoretic complete intersection is given. Finally we apply our method in the computation of the arithmetical rank of certain toric varieties and provide the defining equations of the above toric varieties.
