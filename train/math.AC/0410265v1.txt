In this paper we completely characterize lattice ideals that are complete intersections or equivalently complete intersections finitely generated semigroups of \bz^n\oplus T with no invertible elements, where T is a finite abelian group. We also characterize the lattice ideals that are set-theoretic complete intersections on binomials.
