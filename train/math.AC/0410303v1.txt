Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, I an ideal, M and N finitely generated R-modules. Assume V(I)\cap Supp(M)\cap Supp(N) consists of finitely many maximal ideals and let {\l}(\e^i(N/I^nN,M)) denote the length of \e^i(N/I^nN,M). It is shown that {\l}(\e^i(N/I^nN,M)) agrees with a polynomial in n for n>>0, and an upper bound for its degree is given. On the other hand, a simple example shows that some special assumption such as the support condition above is necessary in order to conclude that polynomial growth holds.
