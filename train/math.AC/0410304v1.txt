Let (R,P) be a commutative, local Noetherian ring, I, J ideals, M and N finitely generated R-modules. Suppose J + ann_R M + ann_R N is P-primary. The main result of this paper is Theorem 6, which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the length of \t_i(M/I^nM,N/J^mN), to agree with a polynomial, for m, n \gg 0. As a corollary, it is shown that the length of \t_i(M/I^nM,N/I^nN)) always agrees with a polynomial in n, for n \gg 0, provided I + ann_R M + ann_R N is P-primary.
