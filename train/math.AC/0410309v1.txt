In this paper, we study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of nonlinearly normal embedding of rational surfaces. Let X be a rational surface and let L \in {Pic}X be a very ample line bundle. For a very ample subsystem V \subset H^0 (X,L) of codimension t \geq 1, if X \hookrightarrow \P (V) satisfies Property N^S_1, then {Reg} (X) \leq t+2\cite{KP}. Thus we investigate Property N^S_1 of noncomplete linear systems on X. And our main result is about a condition of the position of V in H^0 (X,L) such that X \hookrightarrow \P (V) satisfies Property N^S_1. Indeed it is related to the geometry of a smooth rational curve of X. Also we apply our result to \P^2 and Hirzebruch surfaces.
