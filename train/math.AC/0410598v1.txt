Let \fa be an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring R and M a finitely generated R-module. Let t be a natural integer. It is shown that there is a finite subset X of \Spec R, such that \Ass_R(H_{\fa}^t(M)) is contained in X union with the union of the sets \Ass_R(\Ext_R^j(R/\fa,H_{\fa}^i(M))), where 0\leq i<t and 0\leq j\leq t^2+1. As an immediate consequence, we deduce that the first non \fa-cofinite local cohomology module of M with respect to \fa has only finitely many associated prime ideals.
