Let R be an affine algebra of dimension n \geq 3 over an algebraically closed field k. Suppose char k =0 or char k =p \geq n. Let g,f_1,...,f_r be a R-regular sequence and A=R[f_1/g,...,f_r/g]. Let P be a projective A-module of rank n-1 which is extended from R. Let (a,p) \in (A \op P) be a unimodular element and Q=A\op P/(a,p)A. Then, Q is extended from R. A similar result for affine algebras over reals are also proved.
