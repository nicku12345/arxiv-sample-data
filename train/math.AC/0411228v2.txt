In this paper we study standard graded artinian level algebras, in particular those whose socle-vector has type 2. Our main results are: the characterization of the level h-vectors of the form (1,r,...,r,2) for r\leq 4; the characterization of the minimal free resolutions associated to each of the h-vectors above when r=3; a sharp upper-bound (under certain mild hypotheses) for the level h-vectors (1,r,...,a,2) of arbitrary codimension r and type 2, which depends on the next to last entry a.
