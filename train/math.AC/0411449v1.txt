Let \Delta be a stable simplicial complex on n vertexes. Over an arbitrary base field K, the symmetric algebraic shifted complex \Delta^s of \Delta is defined. It is proved that the Betti numbers of the Stanley-Reisner ideals in the polynomial ring K[x_1,x_2,...,x_n] of the symmetric algebraic shifted, exterior algebraic shifted and combinatorial shifted complexes of \Delta are equal.
