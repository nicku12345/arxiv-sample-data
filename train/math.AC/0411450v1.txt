Let (R, {\frak m}) be a local ring, I a proper ideal of R and M a finitely generated R-module of dimension d. We discuss the local homology modules of H^d_I(M). When M is Cohen-Macaulay, it is proved that H^d_{{\frak m}}(M) is co-Cohen-Macaulay of N.dimension d and H^{\underline{x}}_d(H^d_{{\frak m}}(M))\cong\hat{M} where \underline{x}=(x_1,...,x_d) is a system of parameters for M.
