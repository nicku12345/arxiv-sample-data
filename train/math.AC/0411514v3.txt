Let A be a commutative Noetherian ring, and let R = A[X] be the polynomial ring in an infinite collection X of indeterminates over A. Let {\mathfrak S}_{X} be the group of permutations of X. The group {\mathfrak S}_{X} acts on R in a natural way, and this in turn gives R the structure of a left module over the left group ring R[{\mathfrak S}_{X}]. We prove that all ideals of R invariant under the action of {\mathfrak S}_{X} are finitely generated as R[{\mathfrak S}_{X}]-modules. The proof involves introducing a certain well-quasi-ordering on monomials and developing a theory of Gr\"obner bases and reduction in this setting. We also consider the concept of an invariant chain of ideals for finite-dimensional polynomial rings and relate it to the finite generation result mentioned above. Finally, a motivating question from chemistry is presented, with the above framework providing a suitable context in which to study it.
