Fix a codimension r and a socle-vector s. Is there an (entry by entry) maximal h-vector h among the h-vectors of all the (standard graded artinian) algebras having data (r,s)? Extending a definition of Iarrobino, if such an h exists, we define as {\it generalized compressed} (GCA, in brief) any algebra having the data (r,s,h). The two main results of this paper are: Theorem A, where we supply a very natural upper-bound H for all the h-vectors possible for a given pair (r,s); Theorem B, which asserts that, under certain conditions on the pair (r,s), the upper-bound H of Theorem A is actually achieved by a GCA. In particular, it follows that, when r=2, there always exists a GCA (having h-vector H). Moreover, we show that, in general, the hypotheses of Theorem B cannot be improved, i.e., under weaker conditions on the pair (r,s), the upper-bound H above is not always achieved.
