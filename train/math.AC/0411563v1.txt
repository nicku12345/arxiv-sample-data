This paper is the continuation of the previous work on generalized compressed algebras (GCA's). First we exhibit a new class of socle-vectors s which admit a GCA (whose h-vector is lower than the upper-bound H of Theorem A of the previous paper). In particular, it follows that for every socle-vector s of type 2 there exists a GCA (in any codimension r). The main result of this paper is the following: there exist pairs (r,s) which do not admit a GCA. Moreover, the way this pathology occurs may be "arbitrarily bad" (even in codimension 3). Finally, we start considering the difficult problem of characterizing the pairs (r,s) which admit a GCA, focusing on a particular class of socle-vectors of codimension 3.
