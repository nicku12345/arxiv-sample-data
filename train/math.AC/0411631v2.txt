We study Auslander correspondence from the viewpoint of higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory on maximal orthogonal subcategories. We give homological characterizations of Auslander algebras, especially an answer to a question of M. Artin. They are also closely related to Auslander's representation dimension of artin algebras and Van den Bergh's non-commutative crepant resolutions of Gorenstein singularities.
