For a finitely generated, non-free module M over a CM local ring (R,\fm,k), it is proved that for n\gg 0 the length of \tor 1RM{R/\fm^{n+1}} is given by a polynomial of degree \dim R-1. The vanishing of \tor iRM{N/\fm^{n+1}N} is studied, with a view towards answering the question: if there exists a finitely generated R-module N with \dim N\ge 1 such that the projective dimension or the injective dimension of N/\fm^{n+1}N is finite, then is R-regular? Upper bounds are provided for n beyond which the question has an affirmative answer.
