Let R be the quotient of a polynomial ring over a field k by an ideal generated by monomials. We derive a formula for the multigraded Poincare' series of R, i.e., the generating function for the ranks of the modules in a minimal multigraded free resolution of k over R. The formula can be expressed in terms of the homology of lower intervals in a certain lattice associated to the minimal set of generators for the ideal.
