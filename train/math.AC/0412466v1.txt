We first determine all height four Gorenstein sequences beginning H=(1,4,7,...), and we show that their first differences satisfy \Delta H_{\le j/2} is an O-sequence.   We then study the family PGor(H) parametrizing all graded Artinian Gorenstein [AG] quotients A=R/I of the polynomial ring R=K[w,x,y,z] having a Hilbert function H as above. We give a structure theorem for such AG quotients with I_2\cong < wx,wy,wz>. For most H this subfamily forms an irreducible component of PGor(H), and for a slightly more restrictive set, PGor(H) has several irreducible components.   M. Boij and others had already shown that PGor(T) is reducible for certain Gorenstein sequences T in codimensions at least four.
