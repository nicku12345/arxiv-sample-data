This paper centers around Artinianness of the local cohomology of ZD-modules. Let \fa be an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring R. The notion of \fa-relative Goldie dimension of an R-module M, as a generalization of that of Goldie dimension is presented. Let M be a ZD-module such that \fa-relative Goldie dimension of any quotient of M is finite. It is shown that if \dim R/\fa=0, then the local cohomology modules H^i_{\fa}(M) are Artinian. Also, it is proved that if d=\dim M is finite, then H^d_{\fa}(M) is Artinian, for any ideal \fa of R . These results extend the previously known results concerning Artinianness of local cohomology of finitely generated modules.
