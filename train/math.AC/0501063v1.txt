For a finitely generated module M, over a commutative Noetherian local ring (R, \mathfrak{m}), it is shown that there exist only a finite number of non--isomorphic top local cohomology modules \mathrm{H}_{\mathfrak{a}}^{\mathrm{dim} (M)}(M), for all ideals \mathfrak{a} of R. We present a reduced secondary representation for the top local cohomology modules with respect to an ideal. It is also shown that for a given integer r\geq 0, if \mathrm{H}_{\mathfrak{a}}^{r}(R/\mathfrak {p}) is zero for all \mathfrak{p} in \mathrm{Supp}(M), then \mathrm{H}_{\mathfrak{a}}^{i}(M)= 0 for all i\geq r.
