We study mixing properties of algebraic actions of \mathbb Q^d, showing in particular that prime mixing \mathbb Q^d actions on connected groups are mixing of all orders, as is the case for \mathbb Z^d-actions. This is shown using a uniform result on the solution of S-unit equations in characteristic zero fields due to Evertse, Schlickewei and Schmidt. In contrast, algebraic actions of the much larger group \mathbb Q^* are shown to behave quite differently, with finite order of mixing possible on connected groups.
