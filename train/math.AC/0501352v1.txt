The Groebner fan of an ideal I\subset k[x_1,...,x_n], defined by Mora and Robbiano, is a complex of polyhedral cones in R^n. The maximal cones of the fan are in bijection with the distinct monomial initial ideals of I as the term order varies. If I is homogeneous the Groebner fan is complete and is the normal fan of the state polytope of I. In general the Groebner fan is not complete and therefore not the normal fan of a polytope. We may ask if the restricted Groebner fan, a subdivision of R_{>=0}^n, is regular i.e. the normal fan of a polyhedron. The main result of this paper is an example of an ideal in Q[x_1,...,x_4] whose restricted Groebner fan is not regular.
