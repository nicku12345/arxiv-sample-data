Let X=(x_{ij}) and Y=(y_{ij}) be generic n by n matrices and Z=XY-YX. Let S=k[x_{11},...,x_{nn},y_{11},...,y_{nn}], where k is a field, let I be the ideal generated by the entries of Z and let R=S/I. We give a conjecture on the first syzygies of I, show how these can be used to give a conjecture on the canonical module of R. Using this and the Hilbert series of I we give a conjecture on the Betti numbers of I in the 4 \times 4 case. We also give some guesses on the structure of the resolution in general.
