Type III unprojection plays a very important role in the birational geometry of Fano threefolds. It was first introduced by A. Corti on his calculations of Fano threefolds of genus 6 and 7.   It seems that at present a general definition of the type III unprojection is still missing. After proving some general facts about residual ideals, we propose a definition for the generic Type III unprojection, and prove that it gives a Gorenstein ring.
