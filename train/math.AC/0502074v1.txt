The notion of weakly Laskerian modules was introduced recently by the authors. Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring with identity, \fa an ideal of R, and M a weakly Laskerian module. It is shown that if \fa is principal, then the set of associated primes of the local cohomology module H_{\fa}^i(M) is finite for all i\geq 0. We also prove that when R is local, then \Ass_R(H_{\fa}^i(M)) is finite for all i\geq 0 in the following cases: (1) \dim R\leq 3, (2) \dim R/\fa\leq 1, (3) M is Cohen-Macaulay and for any ideal \fb, with l=\grade(\fb,M), \Hom_R(R/\fb,H_{\fb}^{l+1}(M)) is weakly Laskerian.
