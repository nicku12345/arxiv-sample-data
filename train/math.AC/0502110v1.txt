Let m, n, a_1, ..., a_r, b_1, ..., b_r be integers with 1\leq a_1<...<a_r\leq m and 1\leq b_1<...<b_r\leq n. And let x be the universal m\times n matrix with the property that i-minors of first a_i-1 rows and first b_i-1 columns are all zero, for i=1, ..., r+1 (a_{r+1}=m+1 and b_{r+1}=n+1). For an integer u with 1\leq u\leq m, we denote by U the u\times n matrix consisting of the first u rows of x. In this paper, we consider the analytic spread and the reduction number of the ideal of maximal minors of U
