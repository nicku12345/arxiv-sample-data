This paper gives an algebraic characterization of expansive actions of countable abelian groups on compact abelian groups. This naturally extends the classification of expansive algebraic \mathbb{Z}^d-actions given by Schmidt using complex varieties. Also included is an application to a natural class of examples arising from unit subgroups of integral domains.
