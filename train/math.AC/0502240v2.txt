Using multigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, we study the equations defining a projective embedding of a variety X. Given globally generated line bundles B_1, ..., B_k on X and integers m_1, ..., m_k, consider the line bundle L := B_1^m_1 \otimes ... \otimes B_k^m_k. We give conditions on the m_i which guarantee that the ideal of X in P(H^0(X,L)) is generated by quadrics and the first p syzygies are linear. This yields new results on the syzygies of toric varieties and the normality of polytopes.
