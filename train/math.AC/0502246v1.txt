We prove that if f: (R,\m) \to (S,\n) is a flat local homomorphism, S/\m S is Cohen-Macaulay and F-injective, and R and S share a weak test element, then a tight closure analogue of the (standard) formula for depth and regular sequences across flat base change holds. As a corollary, it follows that phantom depth commutes with completion for excellent local rings. We give examples to show that the analogue does not hold for surjective base change.
