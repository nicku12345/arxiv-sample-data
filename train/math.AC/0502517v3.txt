We study local cohomology of rings of global sections of sheafs on the Alexandrov space of a partially ordered set. We give a criterion for a splitting of the local cohomology groups into summands determined by the cohomology of the poset and the local cohomology of the stalks. The face ring of a rational pointed fan can be considered as the ring of global sections of a flasque sheaf on the face poset of the fan. Thus we obtain a decomposition of the local cohomology of such face rings. Since the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex is the face ring of a rational pointed fan, our main result can be interpreted as a generalization of Hochster's decomposition of local cohomology of Stanley-Reisner rings.
