Recently, W. Barth and S. Rams discussed sextics with up to 30 A_2-singularities (also called cusps) and their connection to coding theory [math.AG/0403018]. In the present paper, we find a sextic with 35 cusps within a four-parameter family of surfaces of degree 6 in projective three-space with dihedral symmetry D_5. This narrows the possibilities for the maximum number \mu_{A_2}(6) of A_2-singularities on a sextic to 35 \le \mu_{A_2}(6) \le 37. To construct this surface, we use a general algorithm in characteristic zero for finding hypersurfaces with many singularities within a family.
