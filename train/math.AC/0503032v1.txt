In this paper, the boundedness properties for some multilinear operators related to certain integral operators from Lebesgue spaces to Orlicz spaces are obtained. The operators include Calder\'on--Zygmund singular integral operator, fractional integral operator, Littlewood--Paley operator and Marcinkiewicz operator.
