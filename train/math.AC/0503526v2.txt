The purpose of this note is to supply an upper and a lower bound (which are in general sharp) for the h-vector of a level algebra which is relatively compressed with respect to any arbitrary level algebra A. The useful concept of relatively compressed algebra was recently introduced in [MMN] by Migliore {\it et al.} (whose investigations mainly focused on the particular case of A a complete intersection). The key idea of this note is the simple observation that the level algebras which are relatively compressed with respect to A coincide (after an obvious isomorphism) with the generic level quotients of suitable truncations of A. Therefore, we are able to apply to relatively compressed algebras the main result of our recent work [Za3].
