Let S = K[x_1, ..., x_n] denote the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K with each \deg x_i = 1. Let \Delta be a simplicial complex on [n] = \{1, ..., n \} and I_\Delta \subset S its Stanley--Reisner ideal. We write \Delta^e for the exterior algebraic shifted complex of \Delta and \Delta^c for a combinatorial shifted complex of \Delta. Let \beta_{ii+j}(I_{\Delta}) = \dim_K \Tor_i(K, I_\Delta)_{i+j} denote the graded Betti numbers of I_\Delta. In the present paper it will be proved that (i) \beta_{ii+j}(I_{\Delta^e}) \leq \beta_{ii+j}(I_{\Delta^c}) for all i and j, where the base field is infinite, and (ii) \beta_{ii+j}(I_{\Delta}) \leq \beta_{ii+j}(I_{\Delta^c}) for all i and j, where the base field is arbitrary. Thus in particular one has \beta_{ii+j}(I_\Delta) \leq \beta_{ii+j}(I_{\Delta^{lex}}) for all i and j, where \Delta^{lex} is the unique lexsegment simplicial complex with the same f-vector as \Delta and where the base field is arbitrary.
