We present a rational expression for the trace of the multiplication map M_r in a finite-dimensional algebra of the form A:=K[x_1,...,x_n]/I in terms of the generalized Chow form of I. Here, I is a zero-dimensional ideal of K[x_1,...,x_n] is a zero-dimensional ideal, K is a field of characteristic zero, and r(x_1,..., x_n) a rational function whose denominator is not a zero divisor in A. If I is a complete intersection in the torus, we get numerator and denominator formulas for traces in terms of sparse resultants.
