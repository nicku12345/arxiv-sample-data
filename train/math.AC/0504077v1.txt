Herzog, Huneke, and Srinivasan have conjectured that for any homogeneous k-algebra, the multiplicity is bounded above by a function of the maximal degrees of the syzygies and below by a function of the minimal degrees of the syzygies. The goal of this paper is to establish the multiplicity conjecture of Herzog, Huneke, and Srinivasan about the multiplicity of graded Cohen-Macaulay algebras over a field k for k-algebras k[x_1, ..., x_n]/I being I a determinantal ideal of arbitrary codimension.
