Let K be an infinite field and R=K[x_1,...,x_n] be the polynomial ring. Let V=V_1, ..., V_m be a collection of vector spaces of linear forms. Denote by A(V) the K-subalgebra of R generated by the elements of the product V_1... V_m. Our goal is to investigate the properties of the algebra A(V) and the relations with two problems in algebraic combinatorics White's and related conjectures on polymatroids and the study of integral posets.
