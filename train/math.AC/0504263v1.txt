Classically, Groebner bases are computed by first prescribing a set monomial order. Moss Sweedler suggested an alternative and developed a framework to perform such computations by using valuation rings in place of monomial orders. We build on these ideas by providing a class of valuations on rational function fields of two variables that are suitable for this framework. For these valuations, we explicitly compute the image of an underlying polynomial ring and use this to perform computations concerning ideals in the polynomial ring. Interestingly, for these valuations, some ideals have a finite Groebner basis with respect to the valuation that is not a Groebner basis with respect to any monomial order, whereas other ideals only have Groebner bases that are infinite with respect to the valuation.
