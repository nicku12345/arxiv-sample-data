Given a homomorphism of commutative noetherian rings R --> S and an S-module N, it is proved that the Gorenstein flat dimension of N over R, when finite, may be computed locally over S. When, in addition, the homomorphism is local and N is finitely generated over S, the Gorenstein flat dimension equals sup{m | Tor^R_m(E,N) \noteq 0} where E is the injective hull of the residue field of R. This result is analogous to a theorem of Andr\'e on flat dimension.
