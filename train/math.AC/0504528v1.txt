A Gotzmann monomial ideal of the polynomial ring is a monomial ideal which is generated in one degree and which satisfies Gotzmann's persistence theorem. A subset V is said to be a Gotzmann subset if the ideal generated by V is a Gotzmann monomial ideal. In the present paper, we find all integers a>0 such that every Gotzmann subset V with |V|=a is lexsegment (up to the permutation of the variables). In addition, we classify all Gotzmann subsets of K[x_1,x_2,x_3].
