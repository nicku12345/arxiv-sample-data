It is unknown if an Artinian level O-sequence of codimension 3 and type r (\ge 2) is unimodal, while it is known that any Gorenstein O-sequence of codimension 3 is unimodal. We show that some Artinian non-unimodal O-sequence of codimension 3 cannot be level. We also find another non-level case: if some Artinian algebra A of codimension 3 has the Hilbert function \begin{matrix}\H & : & h_0 & h_1 & ... & h_{d-1} & \underbrace{h_d ... h_d}_{s\text{-times}} & h_{d+s}, \end{matrix}  such that h_d<h_{d+s} and s\ge 2, then A has a socle element in degree d+s-2, that is, A is not level.
