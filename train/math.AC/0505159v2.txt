Let F be a finite set of monomials of the same degree d\geq 2 in a polynomial ring R=k[x_1,...,x_n] over an arbitrary field k. We give some necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the birationality of the ring extension k[F]\subset R^{(d)}, where R^{(d)} is the d{\it th} Veronese subring of R. One of our results extends to arbitrary characteristic, in the case of rational monomial maps, a previous syzygy-theoretic birationality criterion in characteristic zero
