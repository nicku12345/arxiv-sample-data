Cohen-Macaulay dimension for modules over a commutative noetherian local ring has been defined by A. A. Gerko. That is a homological invariant sharing many properties with projective dimension and Gorenstein dimension. The main purpose of this paper is to extend the notion of Cohen-Macaulay dimension for modules over commutative noetherian local rings to that for bounded complexes over non-commutative noetherian rings.
