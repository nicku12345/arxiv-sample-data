After [J.Herzog, D.Popescu, Finite filtrations of modules and shellable multicomplexes, Preprint IMAR no 4/2005, Bucharest, 2005], the shellability of multicomplexes \Gamma is given in terms of some special faces of \Gamma called facets. Here we give a criterion for the shellability in terms of maximal facets. Multigraded pretty clean filtration is the algebraic counterpart of a shellable multicomplex. We give also a criterion for the existence of a multigraded pretty clean filtration.
