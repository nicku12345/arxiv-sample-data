In this note I give a description of Lyubeznik's local cohomology invariants for a certain natural class of local rings, namely the ones which have the same local cohomology vanishing as one expects from an isolated singularity. This strengthens the results of Bondu and myself in math.AG/0406265 while at the same time somewhat simplifying the proofs. Through examples I further point out the bad behavior of these invariants under reduction to positive characteristic.
