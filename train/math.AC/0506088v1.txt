Consider the diagonal action of SL_n(K) on the affine space X=V^{\oplus m}\oplus (V^*)^{\oplus q} where V=K^n, K an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic and m,q>n. We construct a "standard monomial" basis for the ring of invariants K[X]^{SL_n(K)}. As a consequence, we deduce that K[X]^{SL_n(K)} is Cohen-Macaulay. We also present the first and second fundamental theorems for SL_n(K)-actions.
