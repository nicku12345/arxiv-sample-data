We deduce results on the dimension and connectedness of degeneracy loci of maps of finite modules f:M\to N over a local noetherian ring (A,{\mathfrak m}). We show for instance that the expected determinantal bounds on the dimension of the t-th degeneracy locus of f hold if f\in {\mathfrak m} Hom (M,N), and that this degeneracy locus is connected in the expected dimension provided \hat A is a domain.
