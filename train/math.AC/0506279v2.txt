The aim of the present exposition is to investigate varieties of almost minimal degree and of low codimension, in particular their Betti diagrams. Here minimal degree is defined as \deg X = \codim X + 2. We describe the structure of the minimal free resolution of a variety X of almost minimal degree of \codim X \leq 4 by listing the possible Betti diagrams.   The most surprising fact is, that the non-arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay case of varieties of almost minimal degree can occur only in small dimensions (cf. Section 2 for the precise statements).   Our main technical tool is a result shown by the authors (cf. \cite{BS}), which says that besides of an exceptional case, (that is the generic projection of the Veronese surface in \mathbb P^5_K) any non-arithmetically normal (and in particular non-arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay) variety of almost minimal degree X \subset \mathbb P^r_K (which is not a cone) is contained in a variety of minimal degree Y \subset \mathbb P^r_K such that \codim(X,Y) = 1.
