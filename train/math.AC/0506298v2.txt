In this paper, the relation between algebraic shifting and join which was conjectured by Eran Nevo will be proved. Let \sigma and \tau be simplicial complexes and \sigma * \tau their join. Let J_\sigma be the exterior face ideal of \sigma and \Delta(\sigma) the exterior algebraic shifted complex of \sigma. Assume that \sigma * \tau is a simplicial complex on [n]=\{1,2,...,n\}. For any d-subset S \subset [n], let m_{\preceq_{rev} S}(\sigma) denote the number of d-subsets R \in \sigma which is equal to or smaller than S w.r.t. the reverse lexicographic order. We will prove that m_{\preceq_{rev} S}(\Delta({\sigma * \tau}))\geq m_{\preceq_{rev} S}(\Delta ({\Delta(\sigma)} * {\Delta (\tau)})) for all S \subset [n]. To prove this fact, we also prove that m_{\preceq_{rev} S}(\Delta(\sigma))\geq m_{\preceq_{rev} S}(\Delta({\Delta_{\phi}(\sigma)})) for all S\subset [n] and for all non-singular matrices \phi, where \Delta_{\phi}(\sigma) is the simplicial complex defined by J_{\Delta_{\phi}(\sigma)}=\init(\phi(J_\sigma)).
