We extend to singular schemes with Gorenstein singularities or fibered in schemes of that kind Bondal and Orlov's criterion for an integral functor to be fully faithful. We also contemplate a criterion for equivalence. We offer a proof that is new even if we restrict to the smooth case. In addition, we prove that for locally projective Gorenstein morphisms, a relative integral functor is fully faithful if and only if its restriction to each fibre also is it. These results imply the invertibility of the usual relative Fourier-Mukai transform for an elliptic fibration as a direct corollary.
