The aim of this paper is to introduce a new notion of sequences called dd-sequences and show that this notion may be convenient for studying the polynomial property of partial Euler-Poincare' characteristics of the Koszul complex with respect to the powers of a system of parameters. Some results about the dd-sequences, the partial Euler-Poincare' characteristics and the lengths of local cohomology modules are presented in the paper. There are also applications of dd-sequences on the structure of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay modules.
