In this paper we present characterizations of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay modules in terms of systems of parameters, which are generalizations of well-known results on Cohen-Macaulay and generalized Cohen-Macaulay modules. The sequentially Cohen-Macaulayness of Stanley-Reisner rings of small embedding dimension are also examined.
