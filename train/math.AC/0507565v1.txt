A short new proof of the fact that all shifted complexes are fixed by reverse lexicographic shifting is given. A notion of lexicographic shifting, \Delta_{\lex} -- an operation that transforms a monomial ideal of S=\field[x_i: i\in\N] that is finitely generated in each degree into a squarefree strongly stable ideal -- is defined and studied. It is proved that (in contrast to the reverse lexicographic case) a squarefree strongly stable ideal I\subset S is fixed by lexicographic shifting if and only if I is a universal squarefree lexsegment ideal (abbreviated USLI) of S. Moreover, in the case when I is finitely generated and is not a USLI, it is verified that all the ideals in the sequence \{\Delta_{\lex}^i(I)\}_{i=0}^{\infty} are distinct. The limit ideal \bar{\Delta}(I)=\lim_{i\to\infty}\Delta_{\lex}^i(I) is well defined and is a USLI that depends only on a certain analog of the Hilbert function of I.
