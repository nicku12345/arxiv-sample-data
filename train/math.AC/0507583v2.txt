Let \rho_C be the regularity of the Hilbert function of a projective curve C in \mathbb P^n_K over an algebraically closed field K and \alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1} be minimal degrees for which there exists a complete intersection of type (\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1}) containing the curve C. Then the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of C is upper bounded by \max\{\rho_C+1,\alpha_1+...+\alpha_{n-1}-(n-2)\}. We study and, for space curves, refine the above bound providing several examples.
