A reduced divisor on a nonsingular variety defines the sheaf of logarithmic 1-forms. We introduce a certain coherent sheaf whose double dual coincides with this sheaf. It has some nice properties, for example, the residue exact sequence still holds even when the divisor is singular, and also it has a simple locally free resolution. We specialize to the case when the divisor is an arrangement of hyperplanes in projective space, and relate the properties of stability of the sheaf with the combinatorics of the arrangement. We also extend a Torelli type theorem to non generic arrangements which allows one to reconstruct an arrangement from the sheaf attached to it.
