This paper is concerned with the tight closure of an ideal I in a commutative Noetherian ring R of prime characteristic p. The formal definition requires, on the face of things, an infinite number of checks to determine whether or not an element of R belongs to the tight closure of I. The situation in this respect is much improved by Hochster's and Huneke's test elements for tight closure, which exist when R is a reduced algebra of finite type over an excellent local ring of characteristic p.   More recently, Hochster and Huneke have introduced the concept of test exponent for tight closure: existence of these test exponents would mean that one would have to perform just one single check to determine whether or not an element of R belongs to the tight closure of I. However, to quote Hochster and Huneke, 'it is not at all clear whether to expect test exponents to exist; roughly speaking, test exponents exist if and only if tight closure commutes with localization'.   The main purpose of this paper is to provide a short direct proof that test exponents exist for parameter ideals in a reduced excellent equidimensional local ring of characteristic p.
