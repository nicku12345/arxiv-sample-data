The main invariant to study the combinatorics of a simplicial complex K is the associated face ring or Stanley-Reisner algebra. Reisner respectively Stanley explained in which sense Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein properties of the face ring are reflected by geometric and/or combinatoric properties of the simplicial complex. We give a new proof for these result by homotopy theoretic methods and constructions. Our approach is based on ideas used very successfully in the analysis of the homotopy theory of classifying spaces.
