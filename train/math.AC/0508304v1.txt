Let A be a commutative Noetherian ring of dimension n (n \ge 3). Let I be a local complete intersection ideal in A[T] of height n. Suppose I/{I^2} is free {A[T]}/I-module of rank n and ({A[T]}/I) is torsion in K_0(A[T]). It is proved in this paper that I is a set theoretic complete intersection ideal in A[T] if one of the following conditions holds: (1) n \ge 5, odd; (2) n is even, and A contains the field of rational numbers; (3) n = 3, and A contains the field of rational numbers.
