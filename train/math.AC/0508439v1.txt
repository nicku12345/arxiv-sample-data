Hochster established the existence of a commutative noetherian ring \tilde C and a universal resolution U of the form 0\to \tilde C^{e}\to \tilde C^{f}\to \tilde C^{g}\to 0 such that for any commutative noetherian ring S and any resolution V equal to 0\to S^{e}\to S^{f}\to S^{g}\to 0, there exists a unique ring homomorphism \tilde C\to S with V=U\otimes_{\tilde C} S. In the present paper we assume that f=e+g and we find the minimal resolution of {\bf K}\otimes \tilde C by free B-modules, where \bf K is a field of characteristic zero and B is a polynomial ring over \bf K. Our techniques are geometric. We use the Bott algorithm and the Representation Theory of the General Linear Group. As a by-product of our work, we resolve a family of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules defined over a determinantal ring.
