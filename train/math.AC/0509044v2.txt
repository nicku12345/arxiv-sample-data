For a prime number p, we construct a generating set for the ring of invariants for the p+1 dimensional indecomposable modular representation of a cyclic group of order p^2. We then use the constructed invariants to describe the decomposition of the symmetric algebra as a module over the group ring, confirming the Periodicity Conjecture of Ian Hughes and Gregor Kemper for this case.
