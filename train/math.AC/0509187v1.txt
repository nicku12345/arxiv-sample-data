A Turaev-Viro invariant is a state sum, i.e., a polynomial that can be read off from a special spine or a triangulation of a compact 3-manifold. If the polynomial is evaluated at the solution of a certain system of polynomial equations (Biedenharn-Elliott equations) then the result is a homeomorphism invariant of the manifold (``numerical Turaev-Viro invariant''). The equation system defines an ideal, and actually the coset of the polynomial with respect to that ideal is a homeomorphism invariant as well (``ideal Turaev-Viro invariant''). It is clear that ideal Turaev-Viro invariants are at least as strong as numerical Turaev-Viro invariants, and we show that there is reason to expect that they are strictly stronger. They offer a more unified approach, since many numerical Turaev-Viro invariants can be captured in a singly ideal Turaev-Viro invariant. Using computer algebra, we obtain computational results on some examples of ideal Turaev-Viro invariants.
