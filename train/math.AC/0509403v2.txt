Let A = K[x_1, ..., x_n] denote the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K of characteristic 0 with each \deg x_i = 1. Given arbitrary integers i and j with 2 \leq i \leq n and 3 \leq j \leq n, we will construct a monomial ideal I \subset A such that (i) \beta_k(I) < \beta_k(\Gin(I)) for all k < i, (ii) \beta_i(I) = \beta_i(\Gin(I)), (iii) \beta_\ell(\Gin(I)) < \beta_\ell(\Lex(I)) for all \ell < j and (iv) \beta_j(\Gin(I)) = \beta_j(\Lex(I)), where \Gin(I) is the generic initial ideal of I with respect to the reverse lexicographic order induced by x_1 > >... > x_n and where \Lex(I) is the lexsegment ideal with the same Hilbert function as I.
