For the domain R arising from the construction T, M,D, we relate the star class groups of R to those of T and D. More precisely, let T be an integral domain, M a nonzero maximal ideal of T, D a proper subring of k:=T/M, \phi: T\to k the natural projection, and let R={\phi}^{-1}(D). For each star operation \ast on R, we define the star operation \ast_\phi on D, i.e., the ``projection'' of \ast under \phi, and the star operation {(\ast)}_{_{T}} on T, i.e., the ``extension'' of \ast to T. Then we show that, under a mild hypothesis on the group of units of T, if \ast is a star operation of finite type, 0\to \Cl^{\ast_{\phi}}(D) \to \Cl^\ast(R) \to \Cl^{{(\ast)}_{_{T}}}(T)\to 0 is split exact. In particular, when \ast = t_{R}, we deduce that the sequence  0\to \Cl^{t_{D}}(D) {\to} \Cl^{t_{R}}(R) {\to}\Cl^{(t_{R})_{_{T}}}(T) \to 0  is split exact. The relation between {(t_{R})_{_{T}}} and t_{T} (and between \Cl^{(t_{R})_{_{T}}}(T) and \Cl^{t_{T}}(T)) is also investigated.
