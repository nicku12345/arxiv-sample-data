We study M(n), the number of distinct values taken by multinomial coefficients with upper entry n, and some closely related sequences. We show that both pP(n)/M(n) and M(n)/p(n) tend to zero as n goes to infinity, where pP(n) is the number of partitions of n into primes and p(n) is the total number of partitions of n. To use methods from commutative algebra, we encode partitions and multinomial coefficients as monomials.
