Let R be a commutative ring with identity and D an R-module. It is shown that if D is pure injective, then D is isomorphic to a direct summand of the direct product of a family of finitely embedded modules. As a result, it follows that if R is Noetherian, then D is pure injective if and only if D is isomorphic to a direct summand of the direct product of a family of Artinian modules. Moreover, it is proved that D is pure injective if and only if there is a family \{T_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in \Lambda} of R-algebras which are finitely presented as R-modules, such that D is isomorphic to a direct summand of a module of the form \Pi_{\lambda\in \Lambda}E_\lambda where for each \lambda\in \Lambda, E_\lambda is an injective T_\lambda-module.
