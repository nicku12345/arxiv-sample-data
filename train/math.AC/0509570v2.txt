Let R be a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein local ring. Recent work has shown that there is a bridge between Auslander categories and modules of finite Gorenstein homological dimensions over R.   We use Gorenstein dimensions to prove new results about Auslander categories and vice versa. For example, we establish base change relations between the Auslander categories of the source and target rings in a homomorphism R -> S of finite flat dimension.
