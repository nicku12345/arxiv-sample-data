Let R be a commutative Noetherian Henselian local ring. Denote by \mathrm{mod} R the category of finitely generated R-modules, and by {\mathcal G} the full subcategory of \mathrm{mod} R consisting of all G-projective R-modules. In this paper, we consider when a given R-module has a right {\mathcal G}-approximation. For this, we study the full subcategory \mathrm{rap}{\mathcal G} of \mathrm{mod} R consisting of all R-modules that admit right {\mathcal G}-approximations. We investigate the structure of \mathrm{rap}{\mathcal G} by observing {\mathcal G}, {\mathcal G}^{\bot} and \mathrm{lap}{\mathcal G}, where \mathrm{lap}{\mathcal G} denotes the full subcategory of \mathrm{mod} R consisting of all R-modules that admit left {\mathcal G}-approximations. On the other hand, we also characterize \mathrm{rap}{\mathcal G} in terms of Tate cohomologies. We give several sufficient conditions for {\mathcal G} to be contravariantly finite in \mathrm{mod} R.
