Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and let K*/K be a finite extension of algebraic function fields of transcendence degree 2 over k. Let v* be a k-valuation of K* with valuation ring V* and let v be the restriction of v* to K. Suppose R --> S is an extension of algebraic regular local rings with quotient fields K and K*, respectively, such that V* dominates S and S dominates R. We prove that there exist sequences of quadratic transforms R --> R' and S --> S' along v* such that S' dominates R' and the map between generating sequences of v and v* in R' and S', respectively, has a toroidal structure. Our result extends the Strong Monomialization theorem of Cutkosky and Piltant.
