Let \fa be an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring R with identity and let M and N be two finitely generated R-modules. Let t be a positive integer. It is shown that \Ass_R(H_{\fa}^t(M,N)) is contained in the union of the sets \Ass_R(\Ext_R^i(M,H_{\fa}^{t-i}(N))), where 0\leq i\leq t. As an immediate consequence, it follows that if either H_{\fa}^i(N) is finitely generated for all i<t or \Supp_R(H_{\fa}^i(N)) is finite for all i<t, then \Ass_R(H_{\fa}^t(M,N)) is finite. Also, we prove that if d=\pd(M) and n=\dim(N) are finite, then H_{\fa}^{d+n}(M,N) is Artinian. In particular, \Ass_R(H_{\fa}^{d+n}(M,N)) is a finite set consisting of maximal ideals.
