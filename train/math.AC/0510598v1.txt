We describe Koszul type complexes associated with a linear map from any module to a free module, and vice versa with a linear map from a free module to an arbitrary module, generalizing the classical Koszul complexes. Given a short complex of finite free modules, we assemble these complexes to what we call Koszul bicomplexes. They are used in order to investigate the homology of the Koszul complexes in projective dimension one. As in the case of the classical Koszul complexes this homology turns out to be grade sensitive. In a special setup we obtain necessary conditions for a map of free modules to be lengthened to a short complex of free modules.
