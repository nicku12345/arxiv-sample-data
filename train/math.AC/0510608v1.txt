Let M be a finite module over a noetherian ring R with a free resolution of length 1. We consider the generalized Koszul complexes \mathcal{C}_{\bar\lambda}(t) associated with a map \bar\lambda:M\to\mathcal{H} into a finite free R-module \mathcal{H} (see [IV], section 3), and investigate the homology of \mathcal{C}_{\bar\lambda}(t) in the special setup when \grade I_M=\rank M=\dim R. (I_M is the first non-vanishing Fitting ideal of M.) In this case the (interesting) homology of \mathcal{C}_{\bar\lambda}(t) has finite length, and we deduce some length formulas. As an application we give a short algebraic proof of an old theorem due to Greuel (see [G], Proposition 2.5). We refer to [HM] where one can find another proof by similar methods.
