A minimal monomial ideal is the combinatorially simplest monomial ideal whose lcm-lattice equals a given finite atomic lattice \hat{L}. The minimal ideal inherits many nice properties of any ideal I whose lcm-lattice also equals \hat{L}, e.g. Cohen-Macaulayness and the dual property of having a linear resolution. Conversely, any ideal having a linear resolution is shown to be (essentially) minimal.
