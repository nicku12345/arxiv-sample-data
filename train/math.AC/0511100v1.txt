Let R be a Dedekind domain, G an affine flat R-group scheme, and B a flat R-algebra on which G acts. Let A \to B^G be an R-algebra map. Assume that A is Noetherian. We show that if the induced map K\otimes A\to (K\otimes B)^{K\otimes G} is an isomorphism for any algebraically closed field K which is an R-algebra, then S\otimes A\to (S\otimes B)^{S\otimes G} is an isomorphism for any R-algebra S.
