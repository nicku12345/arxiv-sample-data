Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, \fa an ideal of R, M and N be two finitely generated R-modules. Let t be a positive integer. We prove that if R is local with maximal ideal \fm and  M\otimes_R N is of finite length then H_{\fm}^t(M,N) is of finite length for all t\geq 0 and l_R(H_{\fm}^t (M,N))\leq \sum_{i=0}^t l_R(\Ext_R^i(M,H_{\fm}^{t-i}(N))). This yields, l_R(H_{\fm}^t(M,N))=l_R(\Ext_R^t(M,N)). Additionally, we show that \Ext_R^i(R/{\fa},N) is Artinian for all  i\leq t if and only if H_{\fa}^i(M,N) is Artinian for all i\leq t. Moreover, we show that whenever \dim (R/{\fa})=0 then H_{\fa}^t(M,N) is Artinian for all t \geq 0.
