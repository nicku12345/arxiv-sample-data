The Multiplicity Conjecture (MC) of Huneke and Srinivasan provides upper and lower bounds for the multiplicity of a Cohen-Macaulay algebra A in terms of the shifts appearing in the modules of the minimal free resolution (MFR) of A. All the examples studied so far have lead to conjecture (see [HZ] and [MNR2]) that, moreover, the bounds of the MC are sharp if and only if A has a pure MFR. Therefore, it seems a reasonable - and useful - idea to seek better, if possibly {\it ad hoc}, bounds for particular classes of Cohen-Macaulay algebras. In this work we will only consider the codimension 3 case. In the first part we will stick to the bounds of the MC, and show that they hold for those algebras whose h-vector is that of a compressed algebra. In the second part, we will (mainly) focus on the level case: we will construct new conjectural upper and lower bounds for the multiplicity of a codimension 3 level algebra A, which can be expressed exclusively in terms of the h-vector of A, and which are better than (or equal to) those provided by the MC. Also, our bounds can be sharp even when the MFR of A is not pure. Even though proving our bounds still appears too difficult a task in general, we are already able to show them for some interesting classes of codimension 3 level algebras A: namely, when A is compressed, or when its h-vector h(A) ends with (...,3,2). Also, we will prove our lower bound when h(A) begins with (1,3,h_2,...), where h_2\leq 4, and our upper bound when h(A) ends with (...,h_{c-1},h_c), where h_{c-1}\leq h_c+1.
