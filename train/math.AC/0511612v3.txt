In this paper, we study Gorenstein injective, projective, and flat modules over a Noetherian ring R. For an R-module M, we denote by {\rm Gpd}_RM and {\rm Gfd}_R M the Gorenstein projective and flat dimensions of M, respectively. We show that {\rm Gpd}_RM<\infty if and only if {\rm Gfd}_RM<\infty provided the Krull dimension of R is finite. Moreover, in the case that R is local, we correspond to a dualizing complex {\bf D} of \hat{R}, the classes A'(R) and B'(R) of R-modules. For a module M over a local ring R, we show that M\in A'(R) if and only if {\rm Gpd}_RM<\infty or equivalently {\rm Gfd}_RM<\infty. In dual situation by using the class B'(R), we provide a characterization of Gorenstein injective modules.
