We consider homogeneous varieties of linear algebras over an associative-commutative ring K with 1, i.e., the varieties in which free algebras are graded. Let F be a free algebra of some variety A of linear algebras over K freely generated by a finite set X, EndF be the semigroup of endomorphisms of F, and AutEndF be the group of automorphisms of the semigroup EndF. We investigate structure of the group AutEndF and its relation to the algebraical and categorical equivalence of algebras from A.   We define a wide class of R1MF-domains containing, in particular, Bezout domains, unique factorization domains, and some other domains. We show that every automorphism of semigroup EndF, where F is a free finitely generated Lie algebra over an R1MF-domain, is semi-inner. This solves the Problem 5.1 left open in [21]. As a corollary, semi-innerity of all automorphism of the category of free Lie algebras over R1MF-domains is obtained. Relations between categorical and geometrical equivalence of Lie algebras over R1MF-domains are clarified.   The group AutEndF for the variety of m-nilpotent associative algebras over R1MF-domains is described. As a consequence, a complete description of the group of automorphisms of the full matrix semigroup of n x n matrices over R1MF-domains is obtained.   We give an example of the variety of linear algebras over a Dedekind domain such that not all automorphisms of AutEndF are quasi-inner.   The results obtained generalize the previous studies of various special cases of varieties of linear algebras over infinite fields.
