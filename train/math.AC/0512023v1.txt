Given an ideal I and a weight vector w which partially orders monomials we can consider the initial ideal \init_w (I) which has the same Hilbert function. A well known construction carries this out via a one-parameter subgroup of a \GL_{n+1} which can then be viewed as a curve on the corresponding Hilbert scheme. Galligo \cite{galligo} proved that if I is in generic coordinates, and if w induces a monomial order up to a large enough degree, then \init_w(I) is fixed by the action of the Borel subgroup of upper-triangular matrices. We prove that the direction the path approaches this Borel-fixed point on the Hilbert scheme is also Borel-fixed.
