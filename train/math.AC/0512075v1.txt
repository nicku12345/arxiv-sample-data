Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, \fa an ideal of R, and let M be a finitely generated R-module. For a non-negative integer t, we prove that H_{\fa}^t(M) is \fa-cofinite whenever H_{\fa}^t(M) is Artinian and H_{\fa}^i(M) is \fa-cofinite for all i<t. This result, in particular, characterizes the \fa-cofiniteness property of local cohomology modules of certain regular local rings. Also, we show that for a local ring (R,\fm), f-\depth(\fa,M) is the least integer i such that H_{\fa}^i(M)\ncong H_{\fm}^i(M). This result in conjunction with the first one, yields some interesting consequences. Finally, we extend the non- vanishing Grothendieck's Theorem to \fa-cofinite modules.
