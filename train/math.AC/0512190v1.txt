The purpose of this survey is to explain some recent results about analogies between characteristic 0 and characteristic p>0 geometry, and to discuss an infinitesimal variant of motivic cohomology.   More specifically, we review results showing that the big de Rham Witt complex of a field is a complex of 0-cycles (section 2), as well as results showing analogies between char. p>0 and char. 0 geometry. Some of those results determine local cohomology invariants of singular varieties (section 3) and others are concerned with congruences modulo q-powers for the number of rational points of varieties defined over \F_q (section 1).
