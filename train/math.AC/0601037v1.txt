Suppose that f:X\to Y is a dominant morphism of 3-folds over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We prove that there exist sequences of blow ups of points and nonsingular curves \Phi:X_1\to X and \Psi:Y_1\to Y such that the induced map f_1:Y_1\to X_1 is a toroidal morphism.   This extends an earlier proof of the author of this theorem with the extra assumption that f is birational.
