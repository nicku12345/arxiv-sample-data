Let P^{2n+1} be a two-cell complex which is formed by attaching a (2n+1)--cell to a 2m--sphere by a suspension map. We construct a universal space U for P^{2n+1} in the category of homotopy associative, homotopy commutative H--spaces. By universal we mean that U is homotopy associative, homotopy commutative, and has the property that any map f\colon P^{2n+1}\lra Y to a homotopy associative, homotopy commutative H--space Y extends to a uniquely determined H--map \bar{f}\colon U\lra Y. We then prove upper and lower bounds of the H--homotopy exponent of U. In the case of a mod~p^r Moore space U is the homotopy fibre S^{2n+1}\{p^r\} of the p^r--power map on S^{2n+1}, and we reproduce Neisendorfer's result that S^{2n+1}\{p^r\} is homotopy associative, homotopy commutative and that the p^r--power map on S^{2n+1}\{p^r\} is null homotopic.
