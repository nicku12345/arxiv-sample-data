Assume that R = \bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb{N}_{0}} R_{i} is a homogeneous graded Noetherian ring, and that M is a  \mathbb{Z}--graded R--module, where  \mathbb{N}_{0} (resp.  \mathbb{Z}) denote the set all non--negative integers (resp. integers). The set of all homogeneous attached prime ideals of the top non--vanishing local cohomology module of a finitely generated module M, \LH_{R_{+}}^{c}(M), with respect to the irrelevant ideal R_{+}: =\bigoplus_{i\geq 1} R_{i} and the set of associated primes of \LH _{R_{+}}^{i}(M) is studied. The asymptotic behavior of \Hom_{R}(R/R_{+}, \LH _{R_{+}}^{s}(M)) for s \geq f(M) is discussed, where f(M) is the finiteness dimension of M. It is shown that \LH_{R_{+}}^{h}(M) is tame if \LH_{R_{+}}^{i}(M) is Artinian for all i > h.
