Given a parametric polynomial ideal I, the algorithm DISPGB, introduced by the author in 2002, builds up a binary tree describing a dichotomic discussion of the different reduced Groebner bases depending on the values of the parameters, whose set of terminal vertices form a Comprehensive Groebner System (CGS). It is relevant to obtain CGS's having further properties in order to make them more useful for the applications. In this paper the interest is focused on obtaining a canonical CGS. We define the objective, show the difficulties and formulate a natural conjecture. If the conjecture is true then such a canonical CGS will exist and can be computed. We also give an algorithm to transform our original CGS in this direction and show its utility in applications.
