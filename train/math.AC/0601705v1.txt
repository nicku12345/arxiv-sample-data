Let \Delta denote the discriminant of a generic binary d-ic. We show that for d \ge 3, the Jacobian ideal of \Delta is perfect of height 2. Moreover, we describe its SL_2-equivariant minimal resolution, and the associated invariant differential equations satisfied by \Delta. A similar result is proved for the resultant of two forms of orders d,e, whenever d \ge e-1. We also explain the role of the Morley form in the determinantal formula for the resultant; this relies upon a calculation which is done in the appendix by A. Abdesselam.
