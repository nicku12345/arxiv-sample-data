This paper studies space curves C of degree d and arithmetic genus g, with homogeneous ideal I and Rao module M = H_{*}^1(I^~), whose main results deal with curves which satisfy Ext^2(M,M)_0=0 (e.g. of diameter, diam M < 3, which means that M is non-vanishing in at most two consecutive degrees). For such curves C we find necessary and sufficient conditions for unobstructedness, and we compute the dimension of the Hilbert scheme, H(d,g), at (C) under the sufficient conditions. In the diameter one case, the necessary and sufficient conditions coincide, and the unobstructedness of C turns out to be equivalent to the vanishing of certain products of graded Betti numbers of the free graded minimal resolution of I. We give classes of obstructed curves C for which we partially compute the equations of the singularity of H(d,g) at (C). Moreover by taking suitable deformations we show how to kill certain repeated direct free factors ("ghost-terms") in the minimal resolution of the ideal of the general curve. For Buchsbaum curves of diameter at most 2, we simplify in this way the minimal resolution further, allowing us to see when a singular point of H(d,g) sits in the intersection of several, or lies in a unique irreducible component of H(d,g). It follows that the products of the graded Betti numbers mentioned above of a generic curve vanish, and that any irreducible component of H(d,g) is reduced (generically smooth) in the diameter 1 case.
