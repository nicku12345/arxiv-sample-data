Let F=(f_1,...,f_q) be a polynomial dominating map from \mathbb{C}^n to \mathbb{C}^q. We study the quotient {\cal{T}}^1(F) of polynomial 1-forms that are exact along the fibres of F, by 1-forms of type dR+\sum a_idf_i, where R,a_1,...,a_q are polynomials. We prove that {\cal{T}}^1(F) is always a torsion \mathbb{C}[t_1,...,t_q]-module. The we determine under which conditions on F we have {\cal{T}}^1(F)=0. As an application, we study the behaviour of a class of algebraic (\mathbb{C}^p,+)-actions on \mathbb{C}^n, and determine in particular when these actions are trivial.
