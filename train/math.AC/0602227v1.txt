In this paper, we establish two results concerning algebraic (\mathbb{C},+)-actions on \mathbb{C}^n. First let \phi be an algebraic (\mathbb{C},+)-action on \mathbb{C}^3. By a result of Miyanishi, its ring of invariants is isomorphic to \mathbb{C}[t_1,t_2]. If f_1,f_2 generate this ring, the quotient map of \phi is the map F:\mathbb{C}^3\to \mathbb{C}^2, x\mapsto (f_1(x),f_2(x)). By using some topological arguments, we prove that F is always surjective. Second, we are interested in dominant polynomial maps F:\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^{n-1} whose connected components of their connected fibres are contractible. For such maps, we prove the existence of an algebraic (\mathbb{C},+)-action \phi on \mathbb{C}^n for which F is invariant. Moreover we give some conditions so that F^*(\mathbb{C}[t_1,...,t_{n-1}]) is the ring of invariants of \phi.
