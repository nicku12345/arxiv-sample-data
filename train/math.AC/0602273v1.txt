Let F be a polynomial mappping from \mathbb{C}^n to \mathbb{C}^q with n>q. We study the De Rham cohomology of its fibres and its relative cohomology groups, by introducing a special fibre F^{-1}(\infty) "at infinity" and its cohomology. Let us fix a weighted homogeneous degree on \mathbb{C}[x_1,...,x_n] with strictly positive weights. The fibre at infinity is the zero set of the leading terms of the coordinate functions of F. We introduce the cohomology groups H^k(F^{-1}(\infty)) of F at infinity. These groups enable us to compute all the other cohomology groups of F. For instance, if the fibre at infinity has an isolated singularity at the origin, we prove that every weighted homogeneous basis of H^{n-q}(F^{-1}(\infty)) is a basis of all the groups H^{n-q}(F^{-1}(y)) and also a basis a the (n-q)^{th} relative cohomology group of F. Moreover the dimension of H^{n-q}(F^{-1}(\infty)) is given by a global Milnor number of F, which only depends on the leading terms of the coordinate functions of F.
