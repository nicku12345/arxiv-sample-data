Let C be a complex affine reduced curve, and denote by H^1(C) its first truncated cohomology group, i.e. the quotient of all regular differential 1-forms by exact 1-forms. First we introduce a nonnegative invariant \mu'(C,x) that measures the complexity of the singularity of C at the point x. Then, if H_1(C) denotes the first singular homology group of C with complex coefficients, we establish the following formula:  dim H^1(C)=dim H_1(C) + \sum_{x\in C} \mu'(C,x)  Second we consider a family of curves given by the fibres of a dominant morphism f:X\to \mathbb{C}, where X is an irreducible complex affine surface. We analyze the behaviour of the function y\mapsto dim H^1(f^{-1}(y)). More precisely, we show that it is constant on a Zariski open set, and that it is lower semi-continuous in general.
