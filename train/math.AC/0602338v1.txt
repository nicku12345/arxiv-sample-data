Let A be an integral k-algebra of finite type over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0. Given a collection {\cal{D}} of k-derivations on A, that we interpret as algebraic vector fields on X=Spec(A), we study the group spanned by the hypersurfaces V(f) of X invariant for {\cal{D}} modulo the rational first integrals of {\cal{D}}. We prove that this group is always a finite \mathbb{Z}/p-vector space, and we give an estimate for its dimension. This is to be related to the results of Jouanolou and others on the number of hypersurfaces invariant for a foliation of codimension 1. As an application, given a k-algebra B between A^p and A, we show that the kernel of the pull-back morphism Pic(B)\rightarrow Pic(A) is a finite \mathbb{Z}/p-vector space. In particular, if A is a UFD, then the Picard group of B is finite.
