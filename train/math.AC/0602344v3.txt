A differential module is a module equipped with a square-zero endomorphism. This structure underpins complexes of modules over rings, as well as differential graded modules over graded rings. We establish lower bounds on the class--a substitute for the length of a free complex--and on the rank of a differential module in terms of invariants of its homology. These results specialize to basic theorems in commutative algebra and algebraic topology. One instance is a common generalization of the equicharacteristic case of the New Intersection Theorem of Hochster, Peskine, P. Roberts, and Szpiro, concerning complexes over noetherian commutative rings, and of a theorem of G. Carlsson on differential graded modules over graded polynomial rings.
