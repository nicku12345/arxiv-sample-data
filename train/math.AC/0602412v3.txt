In this short note, we introduce an analogue of Wilson's theorem for all nonzero elements a_1,a_2,...,a_{q-1} of a finite filed \mathbb{F} with |\mathbb{F}|=q\geq 3, as follows:  \sum_{1\leq i_1< i_2<...< i_k\leq q-1}a_{i_1}a_{i_2}... a_{i_k}=\left\lfloor\frac{k}{q-1}\right\rfloor(-1)^q\hspace{10mm}(k=1,2,..., q-1),  which the left hand side of above formula is the k-th elementary symmetric polynomial evaluated at a_1,a_2,...,a_{q-1}. Specially, letting \mathbb{F}=\mathbb{Z}_p with p\geq 3, reproves Wilson's theorem and yields some Wilson type identities. Finally, we obtain an analogue of Wolstenholme's theorem for nonzero elements of a finite filed.
