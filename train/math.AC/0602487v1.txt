In this paper we prove that the coordinate ring of the pinched Veronese (i.e k[X^3,X^2Y,XY^2,Y^3,X^2Z,Y^2Z,XZ^2,YZ^2,Z^3]\subset k[X,Y,Z]) is Koszul. The strategy of the proof is the following: we can consider a presentation S/I where S=k[X_1,...,X_9]. Using a distinguished weight \omega, it's enough to show that S/in_{\omega}I is Koszul. We write in_{\omega}I as J+H where J is generated by a Gr\"obner basis of quadrics. Finally, we present an extension of the notion of Koszul filtration and we use it to show that (J+H)/J has a linear free resolution over S/J. This implies the Koszulness of S/I.
