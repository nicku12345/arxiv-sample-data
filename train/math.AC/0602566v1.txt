Let A be a d-dimensional local ring containing a field. We will prove that the highest Lyubeznik number \lambda_{d,d}(A) (defined in \cite{l1}) is equal to the number of connected components of the Hochster-Huneke graph (defined in \cite{hh}) associated to B, where B=\hat{\hat{A}^{sh}} is the completion of the strict Henselization of the completion of A. This was proven by Lyubeznik in characteristic p>0. Our statement and proof are characteristic-free.
