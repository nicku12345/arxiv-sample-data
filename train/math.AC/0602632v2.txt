Let R be a {\em differentiably simple Noetherian commutative} ring of characteristic p>0 (then (R, \gm) is local with n:= {\rm emdim} (R)<\infty). A short proof is given of the Theorem of Harper \cite{Harper61} on classification of differentiably simple Noetherian commutative rings in prime characteristic. The main result of the paper is that there {\em exists} a {\em nilpotent simple} derivation of the ring R such that if \d^{p^i}\neq 0 then \d^{p^i}(x_i)=1 for some x_i\in \gm. The derivation \d  is given {\em explicitly}, it is {\em unique} up to the action of the group {\rm Aut}(R) of {\em ring} automorphisms of R. Let \nsder (R) be the set of all such derivations. Then \nsder (R)\simeq {\rm Aut}(R)/{\rm Aut}(R/\gm). The proof is based on {\em existence} and {\em uniqueness} of an {\em iterative} \d-{\em descent} (for each \d \in \nsder (R)), i.e. a sequence \{y^{[i]}, 0\leq i<p^n\} in R such that y^{[0]}:=1, \d(y^{[i]})=y^{[i-1]} and y^{[i]}y^{[j]}={i+j\choose i}y^{[i+j]} for all 0\leq i,j<p^n. For each \d\in \nsder (R), \Der_{k'}(R)=\oplus_{i=0}^{n-1}R\d^{p^i} and k':= \ker (\d)\simeq R/ \gm.
