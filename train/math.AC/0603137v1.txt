In this paper we study existence and uniqueness of rational normal curves in \PP^n passing through p points and intersecting l codimension two linear spaces in n-1 points each. If p+l=n+3 and the points and the linear spaces are generic, one expects the curve to exist, but this is not always the case. Our main result precisely describes in which cases the curve exists and in which it does not exist.
