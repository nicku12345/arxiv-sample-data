We consider three modifications of our involutive algorithm for computing Janet bases. These modifications are related to degree compatible monomial orders and specify selection strategies for non-multiplicative prolongations. By using the standard data base of polynomial benchmarks for \Gr bases software we compare the modifications and confront them with Magma that implements Faug\`{e}re's F_4 algorithm.
