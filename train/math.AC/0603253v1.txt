Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring of dimension n >2 and let A=R[T,T^{-1}]. Assume that the height of the Jacobson radical of R is atleast 2. Let P be a projective A-module of rank n=dim A - 1 with trivial determinant. We define an abelian group called the "Euler class group of A", denoted by E(A). Let \chi be an isomorphism from A to det(P). To the pair (P,\chi), we associate an element of E(A), called the Euler class of P, denoted by e(P,\chi). Then we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for P to have a unimodular element is the vanishing of e(P,\chi) in E(A).   Earlier, Bhatwadekar and Raja Sridharan have defined the Euler class group of R, denoted by E(R), and have proved similar results for projective R-module of rank n. Later, Mrinal K. Das defined the Euler class group of the polynomial ring R[T], denoted by E(R[T]), and proved similar results for projective R[T]-modules of rank n with trivial determinant.
