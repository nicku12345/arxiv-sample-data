Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, and let A = k[x,y]/(f) be a quasi-homogeneous plane curve. We show that for any graded torsion free A-module M, there exists a natural graded integrable connection, i.e. a graded A-linear homomorphism \nabla: \operatorname{Der}_k(A) \to \operatorname{End}_k(M) that satisfy the derivation property and preserves the Lie product.   In particular, a torsion free module N over the complete local ring B = \hat A admits a natural integrable connection if A is a simple curve singularity, or if A is irreducible and N is a gradable module.
