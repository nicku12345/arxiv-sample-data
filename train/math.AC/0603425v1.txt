The theory of generalized matric Massey products has been applied for some time to A-modules M, A a k-algebra. The main application is to compute the local formal moduli \hat{H}_M, isomorphic to the local ring of the moduli of A-modules. This theory is also generalized to \mathcal{O}_X-modules \mathcal{M}, X a k- scheme. In these notes we consider the definition of generalized Massey products and the relation algebra in any obstruction situation (a differential graded k-algebra with certain properties), and prove that this theory applies to the case of graded R-modules, R a graded k-algebra, k algebraically closed. When the relation algebra is algebraizable, that is the relations are polynomials rather than power series, this gives a combinatorial way to compute open (\'{e}tale) subsets of the moduli of graded R-modules. This also gives a sufficient condition for the corresponding point in the moduli of \mathcal{O}_{\Proj(R)}-modules to be singular. The computations are straight forward, algorithmic, and an example on the postulation Hilbert scheme is given.
