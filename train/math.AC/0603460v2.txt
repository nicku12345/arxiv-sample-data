We introduce a new variant of tight closure and give an interpretation of adjoint ideals via this tight closure. As a corollary, we prove that a log pair (X,\Delta) is plt if and only if the modulo p reduction of (X,\Delta) is divisorially F-regular for all large p \gg 0. Here, divisorially F-regular pairs are a class of singularities in positive characteristic introduced by Hara and Watanabe in terms of Frobenius splitting.
