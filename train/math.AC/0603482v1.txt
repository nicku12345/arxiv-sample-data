Let s_{ij} represent a tranposition in S_n. A polynomial P in \mathbb{Q}[X_n] is said to be m-quasiinvariant with respect to S_n if (x_i-x_j)^{2m+1} divides (1-s_{ij})P for all 1 \leq i, j \leq n. We call the ring m-quasiinvariants QI_m[X_n]. We describe a method for constructing a basis for the quotient QI_m[X_3]/< e_1, e_2, e_3>. This leads to the evaluation of certain binomial determinants that are interesting in their own right.
