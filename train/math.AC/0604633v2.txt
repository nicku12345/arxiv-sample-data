Let S=k[x_1,..., x_n] be a polynomial ring over a field k with n variables x_1, ..., x_n, \mmmm the irrelevant maximal ideal of S, I a monomial ideal in S and I' the polarization of I in the polynomial ring S' with \rho variables. We show that each graded piece H_\mmmm^i(S/I)_\aaa, \aaa\in\ZZZ^n, of the local cohomology module H_\mmmm^i(S/I) is isomorphic to a specific graded piece H_{\mmmm'}^{i+\rho-n}(S'/I')_\alphaaa, \alphaaa\in\ZZZ^\rho, of the local cohomology module H_{\mmmm'}^{i+\rho-n}(S'/I'), where \mmmm' is the irrelevant maximal ideal of S'.
