Let K\to L be an algebraic field extension and \nu a valuation of K. The purpose of this paper is to describe the totality of extensions \left\{\nu'\right\} of \nu to L using a refined version of MacLane's key polynomials. In the basic case when L is a finite separable extension and rk \nu=1, we give an explicit description of the limit key polynomials (which can be viewed as a generalization of the Artin--Schreier polynomials). We also give a realistic upper bound on the order type of the set of key polynomials. Namely, we show that if char K=0 then the set of key polynomials has order type at most \mathbb N, while in the case char K=p>0 this order type is bounded above by ([\log_pn]+1)\omega, where n=[L:K]. Our results provide a new point of view of the the well known formula \sum\limits_{j=1}^se_jf_jd_j=n and the notion of defect.
