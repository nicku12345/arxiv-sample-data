In this paper we study the rank one discrete valuations of the field k((X_1,..., X_n)) whose center in k\lcor\X\rcor is the maximal ideal. In sections 2 to 6 we give a construction of a system of parametric equations describing such valuations. This amounts to finding a parameter and a field of coefficients. We devote section 2 to finding an element of value 1, that is, a parameter. The field of coefficients is the residue field of the valuation, and it is given in section 5.   The constructions given in these sections are not effective in the general case, because we need either to use the Zorn's lemma or to know explicitly a section \sigma of the natural homomorphism R_v\to\d between the ring and the residue field of the valuation v.   However, as a consequence of this construction, in section 7, we prove that k((\X)) can be embedded into a field L((\Y)), where L is an algebraic extension of k and the {\em ``extended valuation'' is as close as possible to the usual order function}.
