In this paper, we present several algorithms for dealing with graded components of Laurent polynomial rings. To be more precise, let S be the Laurent polynomial ring k[x_1,...,x_{r},x_{r+1}^{\pm 1},..., x_n^{\pm 1}], k algebraicaly closed field of characteristic 0. We define the multigrading of S by an arbitrary finitely generated abelian group A. We construct a set of fans compatible with the multigrading and use this fans to compute the graded components of S using polytopes. We give an algorithm to check whether the graded components of S are finite dimensional. Regardless of the dimension, we determine a finite set of generators of each graded component as a module over the component of homogeneous polynomials of degree 0.
