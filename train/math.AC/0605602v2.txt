We introduce a new general construction, denoted by R\JoinE, called the amalgamated duplication of a ring R along an R--module E, that we assume to be an ideal in some overring of R. (Note that, when E^2 =0, R\JoinE coincides with the Nagata's idealization R\ltimes E.)   After discussing the main properties of the amalgamated duplication R\JoinE in relation with pullback--type constructions, we restrict our investigation to the study of R\JoinE when E is an ideal of R.   Special attention is devoted to the ideal-theoretic properties of R\JoinE and to the topological structure of its prime spectrum.
