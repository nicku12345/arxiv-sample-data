For a polynomial ring R=k[x_1,...,x_n], we present a method to compute the characteristic cycle of the localization R_f for any nonzero polynomial f\in R that avoids a direct computation of R_f as a D-module. Based on this approach, we develop an algorithm for computing the characteristic cycle of the local cohomology modules H^r_I(R) for any ideal I\subseteq R using the \v{C}ech complex. The algorithm, in particular, is useful for answering questions regarding vanishing of local cohomology modules and computing Lyubeznik numbers. These applications are illustrated by examples of computations using our implementation of the algorithm in Macaulay~2.
