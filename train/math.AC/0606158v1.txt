The rings whose simple right modules are absolutely pure are called right SAP-rings. We give a new characterization of right SAP rings, right V rings, and von Neumann regular rings. We also obtain a new decomposition theory of right selfinjective von Neumann regular rings. The relationships between SAP-rings, V-rings, and von Neumann regular rings are explored. Some recent results obtained by Faith are generalized and the results of Wu-Xia are strengthened.
