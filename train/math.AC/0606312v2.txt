Let S be a standard N^k-graded polynomial ring over a field. Let I be a multigraded homogeneous ideal in S and let M be a finitely generated Z^k-graded S-module. We prove that the resolution regularity, a multigraded variant of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, of I^nM is asymptotically a linear function. This shows that the well known Z-graded phenomenon carries to multigraded situation.
