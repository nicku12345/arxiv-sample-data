Let k be a field of positive characteristic p, R be a Gorenstein graded k-algebra, and S=R/J be an artinian quotient of R by a homogeneous ideal.   We ask how the socle degrees of S are related to the socle degrees of F_R^e(S)=R/J^{[q]}. If S has finite projective dimension as an R-module, then the socles of S and F_R^e(S) have the same dimension and the socle degrees are related by the formula: D_i=qd_i-(q-1)a(R), where  d_1\le >...\le d_{\ell}\quad\text{and}\quad D_1\le ... \le D_{\ell} are the socle degrees S and F_R^e(S), respectively, and a(R) is the a-invariant of the graded ring R, as introduced by Goto and Watanabe. We prove the converse when R is a complete intersection.
