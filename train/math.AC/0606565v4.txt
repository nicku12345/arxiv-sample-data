The study of graph vertex colorability from an algebraic perspective has introduced novel techniques and algorithms into the field. For instance, it is known that k-colorability of a graph G is equivalent to the condition 1 \in I_{G,k} for a certain ideal I_{G,k} \subseteq \k[x_1, ..., x_n]. In this paper, we extend this result by proving a general decomposition theorem for I_{G,k}. This theorem allows us to give an algebraic characterization of uniquely k-colorable graphs. Our results also give algorithms for testing unique colorability. As an application, we verify a counterexample to a conjecture of Xu concerning uniquely 3-colorable graphs without triangles.
