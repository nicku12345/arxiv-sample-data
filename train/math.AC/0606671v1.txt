The purpose of this paper is to deepen the study of the Pr\"ufer \star--multiplication domains, where \star is a semistar operation. For this reason, in Section 2, we introduce the \star--domains, as a natural extension of the v--domains, where v is the classical Artin's divisorial operation. We investigate their close relation with the Pr\"ufer \star--multiplication domains. In particular, in Section 3, we obtain a characterization of Pr\"ufer \star--multiplication domains in terms of \star--domains satisfying a variety of coherent-like conditions. In Section 4, we extend to the semistar setting the notion of \texttt{H}--domain introduced by Glaz and Vasconcelos and we show, among the other results that, in the class of the \texttt{H}(\star)--domains, the Pr\"ufer \star--multiplication domains coincide with the \star--domains.
