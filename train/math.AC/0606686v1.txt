This review paper deals with dimension theory of polynomial rings over certain families of pullbacks. While the literature is plentiful, this field is still developing and many contexts are yet to be explored. I will thus restrict the scope of the present survey, mainly, to topics I have worked on over the last decade. The set of pullback constructions studied includes D+M, D+(X_{1}, >..., X_{n})D_{S}[X_{1}, ..., X_{n}], A+XB[X], and D+I.
