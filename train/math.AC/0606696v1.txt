This paper investigates coherent-like conditions and related properties that a trivial extension might inherit from the ground ring over some classes of modules. It captures previous results dealing primarily with coherence, and also establishes satisfactory analogues of well-known coherence-like results on pullback constructions. Our results generate new families of examples of rings (with zerodivisors) subject to a given coherent-like condition.
