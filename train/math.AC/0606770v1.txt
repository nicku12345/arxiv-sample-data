In this paper, we study a particular case of Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat modules, which we call, respectively, strongly Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat modules. These last three modules give us a new characterization of the first modules, and confirm that there is an analogy between the notion of Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat modules and the notion of the usual projective, injective, and flat modules.
