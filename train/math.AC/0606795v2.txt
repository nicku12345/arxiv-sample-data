Let V be a smooth scheme over a field k, and let \{I_n, n\geq 0\} be a filtration of sheaves of ideals in \calo_V, such that I_0=\calo_V, and I_s\cdot I_t\subset I_{s+t}. In such case \bigoplus I_n is called a Rees algebra.   A Rees algebra is said to be a Diff-algebra if, for any two integers N>n and any differential operator D of order n, D(I_N)\subset I_{N-n}. Any Rees algebra extends to a smallest Diff-algebra.   There are two ways to define extensions of Rees algebras, and both are of interest in singularity theory. One is that defined by taking integral closures (in which a Rees algebra is included in its integral closure), and another extension is that defined, as above, in which the algebra is extended to a Diff-algebra.   Surprisingly enough, both forms of extension are compatible in a natural way. Namely, there is a compatibility of higher differential operators with integral closure which we explore here under the assumption that V is smooth over a perfect field.
