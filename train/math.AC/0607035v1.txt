We find a sufficient condition that \H is not level based on a reduction number. In particular, we prove that a graded Artinian algebra of codimension 3 with Hilbert function \H=(h_0,h_1,..., h_{d-1}>h_d=h_{d+1}) cannot be level if h_d\le 2d+3, and that there exists a level O-sequence of codimension 3 of type \H for h_d \ge 2d+k for k\ge 4. Furthermore, we show that \H is not level if \beta_{1,d+2}(I^{\rm lex})=\beta_{2,d+2}(I^{\rm lex}), and also prove that any codimension 3 Artinian graded algebra A=R/I cannot be level if \beta_{1,d+2}(\Gin(I))=\beta_{2,d+2}(\Gin(I)). In this case, the Hilbert function of A does not have to satisfy the condition h_{d-1}>h_d=h_{d+1}.   Moreover, we show that every codimension n graded Artinian level algebra having the Weak-Lefschetz Property has the strictly unimodal Hilbert function having a growth condition on (h_{d-1}-h_{d}) \le (n-1)(h_d-h_{d+1}) for every d > \theta where  h_0<h_1<...<h_\alpha=...=h_{\theta}>...>h_{s-1}>h_s.  In particular, we find that if A is of codimension 3, then (h_{d-1}-h_{d}) < 2(h_d-h_{d+1}) for every \theta< d <s and h_{s-1}\le 3 h_s, and prove that if A is a codimension 3 Artinian algebra with an h-vector (1,3,h_2,...,h_s) such that  h_{d-1}-h_d=2(h_d-h_{d+1})>0 \quad \text{and} \quad \soc(A)_{d-1}=0  for some r_1(A)<d<s, then (I_{\le d+1}) is (d+1)-regular and \dim_k\soc(A)_d=h_d-h_{d+1}.
