Assume R is a local Cohen-Macaulay ring. It is shown that \Ass_R (H^l_I(R)) is finite for any ideal I and any integer l provided \Ass_R (H^2_{(x,y)}(R)) is finite for any x,y\in R and \Ass_R (H^3_{(x_1,x_2,y)}(R)) is finite for any y\in R and any regular sequence x_1,x_2\in R. Furthermore it is shown that \Ass_R (H^l_I(R)) is always finite if \dim (R)\leq 3. The same statement is even true for \dim (R)\leq 4 if R is almost factorial.
