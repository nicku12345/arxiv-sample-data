For n\geq 3, let \Omega_n be the set of line segments between the vertices of a convex n-gon. For j\geq 2, a j-crossing is a set of j line segments pairwise intersecting in the relative interior of the n-gon. We identify line-segments in \Omega_{2n} which can be transformed into each other by a 180^\circ-rotation of the 2n-gon. Let \F_n be the set \Omega_{2n} after identification, then the complex \D_{n,k} of type-B generalized triangulations is the simplicial complex of subsets of \F_n not containing any (k+1)-crossing in the above sense. We demonstrate that \D_{n,k} is a pure, k(n-k)-1+kn dimensional complex that decomposes into a kn-1-simplex and a k(n-k)-1 dimensional homology sphere.   We give a term-order on the monomials in the variables X_{ij}, 1\leq i,j\leq n, such that the corresponding initial ideal of the determinantal ideal generated by the (k+1) times (k+1) minors of the generic n \times n matrix contains the Stanley-Reisner ideal of \D_{n,k}. We show that the minors form a Gr\"obner-Basis whenever k\in\{1,n-2,n-1\}. We conjecture this result to be true for all values of k<n.
