This paper studies Frobenius powers of parameter ideals in a commutative Noetherian local ring R of prime characteristic p. For a given ideal \fa of R, there is a power Q of p, depending on \fa, such that the Q-th Frobenius power of the Frobenius closure of \fa is equal to the Q-th Frobenius power of \fa. The paper addresses the question as to whether there exists a {\em uniform} Q_0 which `works' in this context for all parameter ideals of R simultaneously.   In a recent paper, Katzman and Sharp proved that there does exists such a uniform Q_0 when R is Cohen--Macaulay. The purpose of this paper is to show that such a uniform Q_0 exists when R is a generalized Cohen--Macaulay local ring. A variety of concepts and techniques from commutative algebra are used, including unconditioned strong d-sequences, cohomological annihilators, modules of generalized fractions, and the Hartshorne--Speiser--Lyubeznik Theorem employed by Katzman and Sharp in the Cohen--Macaulay case.
