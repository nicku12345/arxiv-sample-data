Let A=\{{\bf a}_1,...,{\bf a}_m\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n be a vector configuration and I_A \subset K[x_1,...,x_m] its corresponding toric ideal. The paper consists of two parts. In the first part we completely determine the number of different minimal systems of binomial generators of I_A. We also prove that generic toric ideals are generated by indispensable binomials. In the second part we associate to A a simplicial complex \Delta _{\ind(A)}. We show that the vertices of \Delta_{\ind(A)} correspond to the indispensable monomials of the toric ideal I_A, while one dimensional facets of \Delta_{\ind(A)} with minimal binomial A-degree correspond to the indispensable binomials of I_{A}.
