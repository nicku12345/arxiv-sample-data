A few years ago, Huneke and Leuschke proved a theorem which solved a conjecture of Schreyer. It asserts that an excellent Cohen-Macaulay local ring of countable Cohen-Macaulay type which is complete or has uncountable residue field has at most a one-dimensional singular locus. In this paper, it is verified that the assumption of the excellent property can be removed, and the theorem is considered over an arbitrary local ring. The main purpose of this paper is to prove that the existence of a certain prime ideal and a certain totally reflexive module implies the existence of an uncountably infinite number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable totally reflexive modules.
