Given r>=n quasi-homogeneous polynomials in n variables, the existence of a certain duality is shown and explicited in terms of generalized Morley forms. This result, that can be seen as a generalization of [3,corollary 3.6.1.4] (where this duality is proved in the case r=n), was observed by the author at the same time. We will actually closely follow the proof of (loc. cit.) in this paper.
