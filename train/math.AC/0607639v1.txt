Hochster established the existence of a commutative noetherian ring \Cal R and a universal resolution \Bbb U of the form 0\to \Cal R^{e}\to \Cal R^{f}\to \Cal R^{g}\to 0 such that for any commutative noetherian ring S and any resolution \Bbb V equal to 0\to S^{e}\to S^{f}\to S^{g}\to 0, there exists a unique ring homomorphism \Cal R\to S with \Bbb V=\Bbb U\otimes_{\Cal R} S. In the present paper we assume that f=e+g and we find a resolution \Bbb F of \Cal R by free \Cal P-modules, where \Cal P is a polynomial ring over the ring of integers. The resolution \Bbb F is not minimal; but it is straightforward, coordinate free, and independent of characteristic. Furthermore, one can use \Bbb F to calculate \operatorname{Tor}^{\Cal P}_{\bullet}(\Cal R, \Bbb Z). If e and g both at least 5, then \operatorname{Tor}^{\Cal P}_{\bullet}(\Cal R, \Bbb Z) is not a free abelian group; and therefore, the graded betti numbers in the minimal resolution of \pmb K\otimes_{\Bbb Z} \Cal R by free \pmb K\otimes_{\Bbb Z} \Cal P-modules depend on the characteristic of the field \pmb K. We record the modules in the minimal \pmb K\otimes_{\Bbb Z} \Cal P resolution of \pmb K\otimes_{\Bbb Z} \Cal R in terms of the modules which appear when one resolves divisors over the determinantal ring defined by the 2\times 2 minors of an e\times g matrix.
