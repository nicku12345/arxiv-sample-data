The F-thresholds are characteristic p analogs of the jumping coefficients for multiplier ideals in characteristic zero. In this article we give an alternative description of the F-thresholds of an ideal in a regular and F--finite ring R. This enables us to settle two open questions posed in [Mustata, Takagi, Watanabe: F-thresholds and Bernstein-Sato polynomials], namely we show that the F-thresholds are rational and discrete.
