Let S = K[x_1, ..., x_n ] be a polynomial ring over a field K, and E = K < y_1, ..., y_n > an exterior algebra. The "linearity defect" ld_E(N) of a finitely generated graded E-module N measures how far N departs from "componentwise linear". It is known that ld_E(N) < \infty for all N. But the value can be arbitrary large, while the similar invariant ld_S(M) for an S-module M is alway at most n.   We show that if I_\Delta (resp. J_\Delta) is the squarefree monomial ideal of S (resp. E) corresponding to a simplicial complex \Delta on {1, >..., n}, then ld_E(E/J_\Delta) = ld_S(S/I_\Delta). Moreover, except some extremal cases, ld is a topological invariant of the Alexander dual \Delta^\vee of \Delta.   We also show that, when n > 3, ld_E(E/J_\Delta) = n-2 (this is the largest possible value) if and only if \Delta is an n-gon.
