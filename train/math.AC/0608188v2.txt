Let A = K[x_1, ..., x_n] denote the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K with each \deg x_i = 1. Let I be a homogeneous ideal of A with I \ne A and H_{A/I} the Hilbert function of the quotient algebra A / I. Given a numerical function H : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} satisfying H=H_{A/I} for some homogeneous ideal I of A, we write \mathcal{A}_H for the set of those integers 0 \leq r \leq n such that there exists a homogeneous ideal I of A with H_{A/I} = H and with \depth A / I = r. It will be proved that one has either \mathcal{A}_H = \{0, 1, ..., b \} for some 0 \leq b \leq n or |\mathcal{A}_H| = 1.
