Let I be a regular \mathfrak m-primary ideal in (R,\mathfrak m,k). Then the Ratliff-Rush ideal associated to I is denoted by \bar I and is defined as the largest ideal containing I with the same Hilbert polynomial as I. In this paper we present a method to compute Ratliff-Rush ideals for a certain class of monomial ideals in the rings k[x,y] and k[[x,y]]. We find an upper bound for the Ratliff-Rush reduction number for an ideal in this class. Moreover, we establish some new characterizations of when all powers of I are Ratliff-Rush.
