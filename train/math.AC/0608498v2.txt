Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, M a finitely generated R-module and I a proper ideal of R. In this paper we introduce and analyze some properties of r(I, M)=\bigcup_{k\geqslant 1} (I^{k+1}M: I^kM), {\it the Ratliff-Rush ideal associated with I and M}. When M= R (or more generally when M is projective) then r(I, M)= \widetilde{I}, the usual Ratliff-Rush ideal associated with I.   If I is a regular ideal and \ann M=0 we show that \{r(I^n,M) \}_{n\geqslant 0} is a stable I-filtration. If M_{\p} is free for all {\p}\in \spec R\setminus \mspec R, then under mild condition on R we show that for a regular ideal I, \ell(r(I,M)/{\widetilde I}) is finite. Further r(I,M)=\widetilde I  if A^*(I)\cap \mspec R =\emptyset  (here A^*(I) is the stable value of the sequence \Ass (R/{I^n})). Our generalization also helps to better understand the usual Ratliff-Rush filtration. When I is a regular \m-primary ideal our techniques yield an easily computable bound for k such that \widetilde{I^n} = (I^{n+k} \colon I^k) for all n \geqslant 1. For any ideal I we show that \widetilde{I^nM}=I^nM+H^0_I(M)\quad\mbox{for all} n\gg 0. This yields that \widetilde {\mathcal R}(I,M)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} \widetilde {I^nM} is Noetherian if and only if \depth M>0. Surprisingly if \dim M=1 then \widetilde G_I(M)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} \widetilde{I^nM}/{\widetilde{I^{n+1}M}} is always a Noetherian and a Cohen-Macaulay G_I(R)-module. Application to Hilbert coefficients is also discussed.
