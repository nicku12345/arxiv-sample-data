Let K be a field, S a polynomial ring and E an exterior algebra over K, both in a finite set of variables. We study rigidity properties of the graded Betti numbers of graded ideals in S and E when passing to their generic initial ideals. First, we prove that if the graded Betti numbers \beta_{ii+k}^S(S/I)=\beta_{ii+k}^S(S/\Gin(I)) for some i>1 and k \geq 0, then \beta_{qq+k}^S(S/I)= \beta_{qq+k}^S(S/\Gin(I)) for all q \geq i, where I\subset S is a graded ideal. Second, we show that if \beta_{ii+k}^E(E/I)= \beta_{ii+k}^E(E/\Gin(I)) for some i>1 and k \geq 0, then \beta_{qq+k}^E(E/I)= \beta_{qq+k}^E(E/\Gin(I)) for all q \geq 1, where I\subset E is a graded ideal. In addition, it will be shown that the graded Betti numbers \beta_{ii+k}^R(R/I)= \beta_{ii+k}^R(R/\Gin(I)) for all i \geq 1 if and only if I_{< k >} and I_{< k+1 >} have a linear resolution. Here I_{< d >} is the ideal generated by all homogeneous elements in I of degree d, and R can be either the polynomial ring or the exterior algebra.
