We establish bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a finitely generated graded module and its symmetric powers in terms of the degrees of the generators of the module and the degrees of their relations. We extend to modules (and improve) the known bounds for homogenous ideal in a polynomial ring established by Galligo, Guisti, Caviglia and Sbarra.
