If \X \subset \P^n is a reduced and irreducible projective variety, it is interesting to find the equations describing the (higher) secant varieties of \X. In this paper we find those equations in the following cases:   \X = \P^{n_1}\times...\times\P^{n_t}\times\P^n is the Segre embedding of the product and n is "large" with respect to the n_i (Theorem 2.4);   \X is a Segre-Veronese embedding of some products with 2 or three factors;   \X is a Del Pezzo surface.
