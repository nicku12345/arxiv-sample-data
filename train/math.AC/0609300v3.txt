To a dominant morphism \pi:X/S \to Y/S of N{\oe}therian integral S-schemes one has the inclusion C_\pi \subset B_\pi of the critical locus in the branch locus of B_\pi. Conditions on the relative differentials \Omega_{X/Y}, \Omega_{X/S}, and \Omega_{Y/S} are stated that imply bounds on the codimensions of  C_\pi and  B_\pi. We also give bounds on the codimension of the discriminant locus, proving and generalising a conjecture of I. Dolgachev.
