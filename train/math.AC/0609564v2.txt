Let Z be a finite set of double points in P^1 x P^1 and suppose further that X, the support of Z, is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM). We present an algorithm, which depends only upon a combinatorial description of X, for the bigraded Betti numbers of I_Z, the defining ideal of Z. We then relate the total Betti numbers of I_Z to the shifts in the graded resolution, thus answering a special case of a question of T. Roemer.
