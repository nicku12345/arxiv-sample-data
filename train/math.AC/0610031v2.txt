We study generalized Horn-Kapranov rational parametrizations of inhomogeneous sparse discriminants from both a theoretical and an algorithmic perspective. We show that all these parametrizations are birational and prove some results on the corresponding implicit equations. We also propose a combinatorial algorithm to compute the degree of inhomogeneous discriminantal surfaces associated to uniform matrices.
