A proof of freeness of the commutator subgroup of the fundamental group of a smooth irreducible affine curve over a countable algebraically closed field of nonzero characteristic. A description of the abelianizations of the fundamental groups of smooth affine curves over an algebracially closed field of nonzero characteristic is also given.
