We introduce the notion of monomial group action and study some of its consequences for Groebner basis theory. As an application we prove a conjecture of V. Batyrev and O. Popov describing the Cox rings of Del Pezzo surfaces (of degree at least 3) as quotients of a polynomial ring by an ideal generated by quadrics.
