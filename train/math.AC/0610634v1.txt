It is well known that subspaces of the Hardy space over the unit disk which are invariant under the backward shift occur as the image of an observability operator associated with a discrete-time linear system with stable state-dynamics, as well as the functional-model space for a Hilbert space contraction operator. We discuss two multivariable extensions of this structure, where the classical Hardy space is replaced by (1) the Fock space of formal power series in a collection of d noncommuting indeterminates with norm-square-summable vector coefficients, and (2) the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (often now called the Arveson space) over the unit ball in {\mathbb C}^{d} with reproducing kernel k(\lambda, \zeta) = 1/(1 - < \lambda, \zeta >) (\lam, \zeta \in {\mathbb C}^{d} with \| \lambda \|, \| \zeta \| < 1). In the first case, the associated linear system is of noncommutative Fornasini-Marchesini type with evolution along a free semigroup with d generators, while in the second case the linear system is a standard (commutative) Fornasini-Marchesini-type system with evolution along the integer lattice {\mathbb Z}^{d}. An abelianization map (or symmetrization of the Fock space) links the first case with the second. The second case has special features depending on whether the operator-tuple defining the state dynamics is commutative or not. The paper focuses on multidimensional state-output linear systems and the associated observability operators.
