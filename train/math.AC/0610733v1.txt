For a standard Artinian k-algebra A=R/I, we give equivalent conditions for A to have the weak (or strong) Lefschetz property or the strong Stanley property in terms of the minimal system of generators of the generic initial ideal \mathrm{gin}(I) of I under the reverse lexicographic order. Using the equivalent condition for the weak Lefschetz property, we show that some graded Betti numbers of \mathrm{gin}(I) are determined just by the the Hilbert function of I if A has the weak Lefschetz property. Furthermore, for the case that A is a standard Artinian k-algebra of codimension 3, we show that every graded Betti numbers of \mathrm{gin}(I) are determined by the graded Betti numbers of I if A has the weak Lefschetz property. And if A has the strong Lefschetz (resp. Stanley) property, then we show that the minimal system of generators of \mathrm{gin}(I) is determined by the graded Betti numbers (resp. by the Hilbert function) of I.
