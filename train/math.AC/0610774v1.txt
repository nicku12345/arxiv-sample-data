Let A be a locally analytically unramified local ring and let J_1,...,J_k,I be ideals in A. If C=C(J_1,...,J_k;I) is the cone generated by the (k+1)-tuples (m_1,...,m_k,n) such that J_1^{m_1}...J_k^{m_k} is contained in I^n, we prove that the topological closure of C is a rational polyhedral cone. This generalizes results by Samuel, Nagata and Rees.
