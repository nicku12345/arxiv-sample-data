In this paper, we consider positively graded isolated non F-rational singularities (R,m) with d=dim R over the field K of positive characteristic.   We give a representation of lower local cohomologies H^i_m(R) (i<d) in terms of tight closure and limit closure of certain type of parameters.   As an application to isolated singularities, we show a relation between non-vanishing of the tight closure of zero in the highest local cohomology (0)^*_{H^d(R)} and non-vanishing of the cohomology H^{d-1}_m(R).
