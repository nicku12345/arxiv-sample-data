et R be an integral domain with quotient field L. An overring T of R is t-linked over R if I^{-1}=R implies that (T:IT)=T for each finitely generated ideal I of R. Let O_{t}(R) denotes the set of all t-linked overrings of R and O(R) the set of all overrings of R. The purpose of this paper is to study some finiteness conditions on the set O_{t}(R). Particularly, we prove that if O_{t}(R) is finite, then so is O(R) and O_{t}(R)=O(R), and if each chain of t-linked overrings of R is finite, then each chain of overrings of R is finite. This yields that the t-linked approach is more efficient than the Gilmer's treatment in \cite{G1}. We also examine the finiteness conditions in some Noetherian-like settings such as Mori domain, quasicoherent Mori domain, Krull domain etc. We establish a connection between O_{t}(R) and the set of all strongly divisorial ideals of R and we conclude by a characterization of domains R that are t-linked under all their overrings.
