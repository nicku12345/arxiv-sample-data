We study two properties of modules over a local hypersurface R: decency and rigidity. We show that the vanishing of Hochster's function \theta^R(M,N), known to imply decent intersection, also implies rigidity. We investigate the vanishing of \theta^R(M,N) to obtain new results about decency and rigidity over hypersurfaces. We employ a mixture of techniques from Commutative Algebra and Intersection Theory of algebraic cycles.
