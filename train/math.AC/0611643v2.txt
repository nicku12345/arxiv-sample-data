Of the many interesting insights in the Auslander-Bridger Memoir of 1969, the theory of Gorenstein dimension has most often been taken up by commutative algebraists. Over a local ring, it deals with resolutions by modules which are totally reflexive with regard to free modules. For some years now, one has been trying to replace frees by semidualizing modules. This has met with success, and more is to follow. To me however, it makes sense to first try and understand semidualizing modules themselves better. This note shows in a direct way that they share many properties with free modules. One hopes that this will help to make the developing theory more natural and transparent.
