Let (R, \mathfrak m) be a d-dimensional Noetherian local ring and E a finitely generated R-submodule of a free module R^p. In this work we introduce a multiplicity sequence c_k(E), k=0,..., d+p-1 for E that generalize the Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity defined when E has finite colength in R^p as well as the Achilles-Manaresi multiplicity sequence that applies when E\subseteq R is an ideal. Our main result is that the new multiplicity sequence can indeed be used to detect integral dependence of modules. Our proof is self-contained and implies known numerical criteria for integral dependence of ideals and modules.
