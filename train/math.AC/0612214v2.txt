We investigate some properties of regularity of homomorphisms of local algebras over positive characteristic fields. We state a result of monomialization of such a homomorphism between algebras of analytic or algebraic power series. From this we deduce some extensions in positive characteristic of results due to S. Izumi and A. Gabrielov.
