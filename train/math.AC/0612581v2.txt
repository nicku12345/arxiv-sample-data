We study the relationship between the Tor-regularity and the local-regularity over a positively graded algebra defined over a field which coincide if the algebra is a standard graded polynomial ring. In this case both are characterizations of the so-called Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity. Moreover, we can characterize a standard graded polynomial ring as an algebra with extremal properties with respect to the Tor- and the local-regularity. For modules of finite projective dimension we get a nice formula relating the two regularity notions. Interesting examples are given to help to understand the relationship between the Tor- and the local-regularity in general.
