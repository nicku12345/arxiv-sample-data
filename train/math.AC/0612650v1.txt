Generalizing the concepts of Stanley-Reisner and affine monoid algebras, one can associate to a rational pointed fan the toric face ring. Assuming that this ring is Cohen-Macaulay, the main result of this paper is to characterize the situation when its canonical module is isomorphic to a fine graded ideal of the toric face ring. From this result several algebraic and combinatorial consequences are deduced in the situations where the fan may be related to a manifold with non-empty boundary, or the fan is a shellable fan.
