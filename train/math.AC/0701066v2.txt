We introduce an elementary method to give unified proofs of the Dyson, Morris, and Aomoto identities for constant terms of Laurent polynomials. These identities can be expressed as equalities of polynomials and thus can be proved by verifying them for sufficiently many values, usually at negative integers where they vanish. Our method also proves some special cases of the Forrester conjecture.
