We characterize ideals whose adjoints are determined by their Rees valuations. We generalize the notion of a regular system of parameters, and prove that for ideals generated by monomials in such elements, the integral closure and adjoints are generated by monomials. We prove that the adjoints of such ideals and of all ideals in two-dimensional regular local rings are determined by their Rees valuations. We prove special cases of subadditivity of adjoints.
