Let R=k[x_1, ..., x_n] be a polynomial ring and let I\subset R be a graded ideal. In \cite{R}, R\"{o}mer asked whether under the Cohen-Macaulay assumption the i-th Betti number \beta_{i}(R/I) can be bounded above by a function of the maximal shifts in the minimal graded free R-resolution of R/I as well as bounded below by a function of the minimal shifts. The goal of this paper is to establish such bounds for graded Cohen-Macaulay algebras k[x_1, ..., x_n]/I when I is a standard determinantal ideal of arbitrary codimension. We also discuss other examples as well as when these bounds are sharp.
