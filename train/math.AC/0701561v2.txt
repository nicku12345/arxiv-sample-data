We study the set \partition{\nb} of all possible Jordan canonical forms of nilpotent matrices commuting with a given nilpotent matrix B. We describe \partition{\nb} in the special case when B has only one Jordan block. In the general case, we find the maximal possible index of nilpotency in the set of all nilpotent matrices commuting with a given nilpotent matrix. We consider several examples.
