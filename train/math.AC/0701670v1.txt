Factorization of polynomials arises in numerous areas in symbolic computation. It is an important capability in many symbolic and algebraic computation. There are two type of factorization of polynomials. One is convention polynomial factorization, and the other approximate polynomial factorization.   Conventional factorization algorithms use symbolic methods to get exact factors of a polynomial while approximate factorization algorithms use numerical methods to get approximate factors of a polynomial. Symbolic computation often confront intermediate expression swell problem, which lower the efficiency of factorization. The numerical computation is famous for its high efficiency, but it only gives approximate results. In this paper, we present an algorithm which use approximate method to get exact factors of a multivariate polynomial. Compared with other methods, this method has the numerical computation advantage of high efficiency for some class of polynomials with factors of lower degree. The experimental results show that the method is more efficient than {\it factor} in Maple 9.5 for polynomials with more variables and higher degree.
