Let (R,\m) be a Noetherian local ring and M a finitely generated R-module with \dim M=d. This paper is concerned with the following property for the top local cohomology module H^d_\m(M): \Ann (0:_{H^d_\m(M)}\p)=\p\ \text{for all prime ideals} \p\supseteq\Ann H^d_\m(M). In this paper we will show that this property is equivalent to the catenaricity of the unmixed support \Usupp M of M which is defined by \Usupp M=\Supp M/U_M(0), where U_M(0) is the largest submodule of M of dimension less than d. Some characterizations of this property in terms of system of parameters as well as the relation between the unmixed supports of M and of the \m-adic completion \hat M are given.
