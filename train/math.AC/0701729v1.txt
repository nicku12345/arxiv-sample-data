A finitely generated module M over a local ring is called a sequentially generalized Cohen-Macaulay module if there is a filtration of submodules of M: M_0\subset M_1\subset ... \subset M_t=M such that \dim M_0<\dim M_1< >... <\dim M_t and each M_i/M_{i-1} is generalized Cohen-Macaulay. The aim of this paper is to study the structure of this class of modules. Many basic properties of these modules are presented and various characterizations of sequentially generalized Cohen-Macaulay property by using local cohomology modules, theory of multiplicity and in terms of systems of parameters are given. We also show that the notion of dd-sequences defined in \cite{cc} is an important tool for studying this class of modules.
