Let A = K[X_1,...,X_n] and let I be a graded ideal in A. We show that the upper bound of Multiplicity conjecture of Herzog, Huneke and Srinivasan holds asymptotically (i.e., for I^k and all k \gg 0) if I belongs to any of the following large classes of ideals: \begin{enumerate}[\rm (1)]   \item radical ideals. \item monomial ideals with generators in different degrees. \item zero-dimensional ideals with generators in different degrees. \end{enumerate} Surprisingly, our proof uses local techniques like analyticity, reductions, equimultiplicity and local results like Rees's theorem on multiplicities.
