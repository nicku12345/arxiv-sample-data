Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Let \Gamma(R) be a graph with vertices as elements of R, where two distinct vertices a and b are adjacent if and only if Ra+Rb=R. In this paper we consider a subgraph \Gamma_2(R) of \Gamma(R) which consists of non-unit elements. We look at the connectedness and the diameter of this graph. We completely characterize the diameter of the graph \Gamma_2(R)\setminus\J(R). In addition, it is shown that for two finite semi-local rings R and S, if R is reduced, then \Gamma(R)\cong\Gamma(S) if and only if R\cong S.
