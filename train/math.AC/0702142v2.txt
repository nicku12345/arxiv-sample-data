This paper studies the notions of star and semistar operations over a polynomial ring. It aims at characterizing when every upper to zero in R[X] is a *-maximal ideal and when a *-maximal ideal Q of R[X] is extended from R, that is, Q=(Q\cap R)[X] with Q\cap R\not =0, for a given star operation of finite character * on R[X]. We also answer negatively some questions raised by Anderson-Clarke by constructing a Pr\"ufer domain R for which the v-operation is not stable.
