We prove that the d-component of the generic initial ideal, with respect to the reverse lexicographic order, of an ideal generated by a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials of degree d is revlex in a particular, but important, case. Using this property, we compute the generic initial ideal for several complete intersection with strong Lefschetz property.
