We define the strong Lefschetz property for finite graded modules over graded Artinian algebras whose grading is not necessarily standard. We show that most results which have been obtained for Artinian algebras with standard grading can be extended for non-standard grading. Our results on the strong Lefschetz property for non-standard grading can be used to prove that certain Artinian complete intersections with standard grading have the strong Lefschetz property.
