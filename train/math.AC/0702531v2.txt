In this note, we provide several characterizations of regular local rings in positive characteristics, in terms of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and its higher \tor counterparts \i t_i=\underset{n \to \infty}{\lim} \l(\tor_i(k,{}^{f^n} R))/p^{nd}. We also apply the characterizations to improve a recent result by Bridgeland and Iyengar in the characteristic p case. Our proof avoids using the existence of big Cohen-Macaulay modules, which is the major tool in the proof of Bridgeland and Iyengar.
