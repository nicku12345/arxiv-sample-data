In this paper, we provide a simple proof for the fact that two simplicial complexes are isomorphic if and only if their associated Stanley-Reisner rings, or their associated facet rings are isomorphic as K-algebras. As a consequence, we show that two graphs are isomorphic if and only if their associated edge rings are isomorphic as K-algebras. Based on an explicit K-algebra isomorphism of two Stanley-Reisner rings, or facet rings or edge rings, we present a fast algorithm to find explicitly the isomorphism of the associated simplicial complexes, or graphs.
