We construct a (shellable) polyhedral cell complex that supports a minimal free resolution of a Borel fixed ideal, which is minimally generated (in the Borel sense) by just one monomial in S=k[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]; this includes the case of powers of the homogeneous maximal ideal (x_1,x_2,...,x_n) as a special case.   In our most general result we prove that for any Borel fixed ideal I generated in one degree, there exists a polyhedral cell complex that supports a minimal free resolution of I.
