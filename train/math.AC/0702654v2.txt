A cohomological support, Supp_A(M), is defined for finitely generated modules M over an left noetherian ring R, with respect to a ring A of central cohomology operations on the derived category of R-modules. It is proved that if the A-module Ext^R(M,M) is noetherian and Ext_i^R(M,R)=0 for i>>0, then every closed subset of Supp_A(M) is the support of some finitely generated R-module. This theorem specializes to known realizability results for varieties of modules over group algebras, over local complete intersections, and over finite dimensional algebras over a field. The theorem is also used to produce large families of finitely generated modules of finite projective dimension over commutative local noetherian rings.
