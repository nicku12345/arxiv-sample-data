In the first part of this paper we study scrollers and linearly joined varieties.   A particular class of varieties, of important interest in classical Geometry are Cohen--Macaulay varieties of minimal degree.   They appear naturally studying the fiber cone of of a codimension two toric ideals.   Let I\subset S be an ideal defining a linearly joined arrangement of varieties:   - We compute the depth, and the cohomological dimension. is the connectedness dimension.   - We characterize sets of generators of I, and give an effective algorithm to find equations, as an application we compute arithmetical rank. in the case if I defines a union of linear spaces, (ara =projective dimension), in particular this applies to any square free monomial ideal having a 2- linear resolution.   - In the case where V is a union of linear spaces, the ideal I, can be characterized by a tableau, which is an extension of a Ferrer (or Young) tableau.   - We introduce a new class of ideals called simplicial ideals, ideals defining linearly-joined varieties are a particular case of simplicial ideals.
