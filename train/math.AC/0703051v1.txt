Let G be a graph, \chi(G) be the minimal number of colors which can be assigned to the vertices of G in such a way that every two adjacent vertices have different colors and \omega(G) to be the least upper bound of the size of the complete subgraphs contained in G. It is well-known that \chi(G)\geq \omega(G). Beck in \cite{b} conjectured that \chi(\Gamma_0(R))=\omega(\Gamma_0(R)) if \omega(\Gamma_0(R))<\infty, where \Gamma_0(R) is a graph associated to a commutative ring R. In this note, we provide some sufficient conditions for a ring R to enjoy \chi(\Gamma_0(R))=\omega(\Gamma_0(R)). As a consequence, we verify Beck's conjecture for the homomorphic image of \mathbb{Z}^n.
