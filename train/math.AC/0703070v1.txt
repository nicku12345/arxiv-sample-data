A \emph{bipartite monoid} is a commutative monoid \Q together with an identified subset \P \subset \Q. In this paper we study a class of bipartite monoids, known as \emph{mis\`ere quotients}, that are naturally associated to impartial combinatorial games.   We introduce a structure theory for mis\`ere quotients with |\P| = 2, and give a complete classification of all such quotients up to isomorphism. One consequence is that if |\P| = 2 and \Q is finite, then |\Q| = 2^n+2 or 2^n+4.   We then develop computational techniques for enumerating mis\`ere quotients of small order, and apply them to count the number of non-isomorphic quotients of order at most~18. We also include a manual proof that there is exactly one quotient of order~8.
