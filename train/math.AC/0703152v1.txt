The growth of Hilbert coefficients for powers of ideals are studied. For a graded ideal I in the polynomial ring S=K[x_1,...,x_n] and a finitely generated graded S-module, the Hilbert coefficients e_i(M/I^kM) are polynomial functions. Given two families of graded ideals (I_k)_{k\geq 0} and (J_k)_{k\geq 0} with J_k\subset I_k for all k with the property that J_kJ_\ell\subset J_{k+\ell} and I_kI_\ell\subset I_{k+\ell} for all k and \ell, and such that the algebras A=\Dirsum_{k\geq 0}J_k and B=\Dirsum_{k\geq 0}I_k are finitely generated, we show the function k \mapsto_0(I_k/J_k) is of quasi-polynomial type, say given by the polynomials P_0,..., P_{g-1}. If J_k = J^k for all k then we show that all the P_i have the same degree and the same leading coefficient. As one of the applications it is shown that \lim_{k\to \infty}\length(\Gamma_\mm(S/I^k))/k^n \in \mathbb{Q}. We also study analogous statements in the local case.
