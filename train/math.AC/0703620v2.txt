Let A = K[x_1, ..., x_n] denote the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K. We will classify all the Gotzmann ideals of A with at most n generators. In addition, we will study Hilbert functions H for which all homogeneous ideals of A with the Hilbert function H have the same graded Betti numbers. These Hilbert functions will be called inflexible Hilbert functions. We introduce the notion of segmentwise critical Hilbert function and show that segmentwise critical Hilbert functions are inflexible.
