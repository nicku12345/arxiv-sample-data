The following problem is treated: Characterizing the tangent cone and the equimultiple locus of a Puiseux surface (that is, an algebroid embedded surface admitting an equation whose roots are Puiseux power series), using a set of exponents appearing in a root of an equation. The aim is knowing to which extent the well--known results for the quasi--ordinary case can be extended to this much wider family.
