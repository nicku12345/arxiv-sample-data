We introduce a specialization technique in order to study monomial ideals that are generated in degree two by using our earlier results about Ferrers ideals. It allows us to describe explicitly a cellular minimal free resolution of various ideals including any strongly stable and any squarefree strongly stable ideal whose minimal generators have degree two. In particular, this shows that threshold graphs can be obtained as specializations of Ferrers graphs, which explains their similar properties.
