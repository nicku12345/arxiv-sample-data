Let (R, \mathfrak m) denote an n-dimensional Gorenstein ring. For an ideal I \subset R of height c we are interested in the endomorphism ring B = \Hom_R(H^c_I(R), H^c_I(R)). It turns out that B is a commutative ring. In the case of (R,\mathfrak m) a regular local ring containing a field B is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. Its properties are related to the highest Lyubeznik number l = \dim_k \Ext_R^d(k,H^c_I(R)). In particular R \simeq B if and only if l = 1. Moreover, we show that the natural homomorphism \Ext_R^d(k, H^c_I(R)) \to k is non-zero.
