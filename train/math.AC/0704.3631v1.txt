Let S and T be local rings with common residue field k, let R be the fiber product S \times_k T, and let M be an S-module. The Poincar\'e series P^R_M of M has been expressed in terms of P^S_M, P^S_k and P^T_k by Kostrikin and Shafarevich, and by Dress and Kr\"amer. Here, an explicit minimal resolution, as well as theorems on the structure of \Ext_R(k,k) and \Ext_R(M,k) are given that illuminate these equalities. Structure theorems for the cohomology modules of fiber products of modules are also given. As an application of these results, we compute the depth of cohomology modules over a fiber product.
