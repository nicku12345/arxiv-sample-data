We define the notion of a power stable ideal in a polynomial ring  R[X] over an integral domain  R . It is proved that a maximal ideal \chi  M  in  R[X] is power stable if and only if  P^t  is  P- primary for all  t\geq 1  for the prime ideal  P = M \cap R . Using this we prove that for a Hilbert domain R any radical ideal in R[X] which is a finite intersection G-ideals is power stable. Further, we prove that if  R  is a Noetherian integral domain of dimension 1 then any radical ideal in  R[X]  is power stable. Finally, it is proved that if every ideal in  R[X] is power stable then  R  is a field.
