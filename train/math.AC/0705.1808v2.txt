Let R be a local Gorenstein ring with infinite residue field of arbitrary characteristic. Let I be an R--ideal with g=\height I >0, analytic spread \ell, and let J be a minimal reduction of I. We further assume that I satisfies G_{\ell} and {\depth}   R/I^j \geq \dim R/I -j+1 for 1 \leq j \leq \ell-g. The question we are interested in is whether \core{I}=J^{n+1}:\ds \sum_{b \in I} (J,b)^n for n \gg 0. In the case of analytic spread one Polini and Ulrich show that this is true with even weaker assumptions (\cite[Theorem 3.4]{PU}). We give a negative answer to this question for higher analytic spreads and suggest a formula for the core of such ideals.
