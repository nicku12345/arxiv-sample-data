This paper studies the Ratliff-Rush closure of ideals in integral domains. By definition, the Ratliff-Rush closure of an ideal I of a domain R is the ideal given by \tilde{I}:=\bigcup(I^{n+1}:_{R}I^{n}) and an ideal I is said to be a Ratliff-Rush ideal if \tilde{I}=I. We completely characterize integrally closed domains in which every ideal is a Ratliff-Rush ideal and we give a complete description of the Ratliff-Rush closure of an ideal in a valuation domain.
