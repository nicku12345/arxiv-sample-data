If, for a subset S of Z^k, we compare the conditions of being parametrizable (a) by a single k-tuple of polynomials with integer coefficients, (b) by a single k-tuple of integer-valued polynomials and, (c) by finitely many k-tuples of polynomials with integer coefficients (variables ranging through the integers in each case) then (a) implies (b) (obviously), (b) implies (c), and neither converse holds. Condition (b) is equivalent to the set S being the set of integer values taken by some k-tuple of polynomials with rational coefficients as the variables range through the integers. We also show that every co-finite subset of Z^k is parametrizable a single k-tuple of polynomials with integer coefficients.
