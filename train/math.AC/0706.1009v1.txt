By generalizing Gessel-Xin's Laurent series method for proving the Zeilberger-Bressoud q-Dyson Theorem, we establish a family of q-Dyson style constant term identities. These identities give explicit formulas for certain coefficients of the q-Dyson product, including three conjectures of Sills' as special cases and generalizing Stembridge's first layer formulas for characters of SL(n,\mathbb{C}).
