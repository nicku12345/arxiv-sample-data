The generalized test ideals introduced in [HY] are related to multiplier ideals via reduction to characteristic p. In addition, they satisfy many of the subtle properties of the multiplier ideals, which in characteristic zero follow via vanishing theorems. In this note we give several examples to emphasize the different behavior of test ideals and multiplier ideals. Our main result is that every ideal in an F-finite regular local ring can be written as a generalized test ideal. We also prove the semicontinuity of F-pure thresholds (though the analogue of the Generic Restriction Theorem for multiplier ideals does not hold).
