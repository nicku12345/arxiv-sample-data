In this paper, we investigate Murre's conjectures on the structure of rational Chow groups and exhibit explicit Chow--Kuenneth projectors for some examples. More precisely, the examples we study are the varieties which have a nef tangent bundle. For surfaces and threefolds which have a nef tangent bundle explicit Chow--Kuenneth projectors are obtained which satisfy Murre's conjectures and the motivic Hard Lefschetz theorem is verified.
