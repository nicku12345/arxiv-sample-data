Let X be a set of points whose coordinates are known with limited accuracy; our aim is to give a characterization of the vanishing ideal I(X) independent of the data uncertainty. We present a method to compute a polynomial basis B of I(X) which exhibits structural stability, that is, if \widetilde X is any set of points differing only slightly from X, there exists a polynomial set \widetilde B structurally similar to B, which is a basis of the perturbed ideal  I(\widetilde X).
