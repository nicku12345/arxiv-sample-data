We investigate the behavior of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity with respect to some classical functors : Tor, the Frobenius functor in positive characteristic, taking a power or a product (on ideals). These generalizes and refines previous results on these issues by several authors. As an application we provide results on the regularity of an intersection of subschemes of a projective scheme, under appropriate geometric hypotheses. Results on the rigidity of multiple Tor modules and on the characterization of their vanishing are given, motivated by geometric applications.
