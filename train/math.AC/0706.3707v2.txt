We develop tools to study the problem of containment of symbolic powers I^{(m)} in powers I^r for a homogeneous ideal I in a polynomial ring k[{\bf P}^N] in N+1 variables over an algebraically closed field k. We obtain results on the structure of the set of pairs (r,m) such that I^{(m)}\subseteq I^r. As corollaries, we show that I^2 contains I^{(3)} whenever S is a finite generic set of points in {\bf P}^2 (thereby giving a partial answer to a question of Huneke), and we show that the containment theorems of Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith and Hochster-Huneke are optimal for every fixed dimension and codimension.
