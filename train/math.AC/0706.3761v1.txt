Given a stable semistar operation of finite type \star on an integral domain D, we show that it is possible to define in a canonical way a stable semistar operation of finite type [\star] on the polynomial ring D[X], such that D is a \star-quasi-Pr\"ufer domain if and only if each upper to zero in D[X] is a quasi-[\star]-maximal ideal. This result completes the investigation initiated by Houston-Malik-Mott \cite[Section 2]{hmm} in the star operation setting. Moreover, we show that D is a Pr\"ufer \star-multiplication (resp., a \star-Noetherian; a \star-Dedekind) domain if and only if D[X] is a Pr\"ufer [\star]-multiplication (resp., a [\star]-Noetherian; a [\star]-Dedekind) domain. As an application of the techniques introduced here, we obtain a new interpretation of the Gabriel-Popescu localizing systems of finite type on an integral domain D (Problem 45 of \cite{cg}), in terms of multiplicatively closed sets of the polynomial ring D[X].
