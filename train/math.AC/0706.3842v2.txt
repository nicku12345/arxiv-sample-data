Smith and Van den Bergh introduced the notion of finite F-representation type as a characteristic p analogue of the notion of finite representation type. In this paper, we prove two finiteness properties of rings with finite F-representation type. The first property states that if R=\bigoplus_{n \ge 0}R_n is a Noetherian graded ring with finite (graded) F-representation type, then for every non-zerodivisor x \in R, R_x is generated by 1/x as a D_{R}-module. The second one states that if R is a Gorenstein ring with finite F-representation type, then H_I^n(R) has only finitely many associated primes for any ideal I of R and any integer n. We also include a result on the discreteness of F-jumping exponents of ideals of rings with finite (graded) F-representation type as an appendix.
