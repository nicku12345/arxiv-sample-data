In a previous paper, the author together with prof. dr. Finston constructed a class of UFDs A_{n,m} where n,m\in \N^*. These rings are all stably equivalent (A_{n,m}[T]\cong A_{p,q}[T] for all n,m,p,q) but are only isomorphic themselves if (n,m)=(p,q). These examples are the first UFD examples over a characteristically closed field satisfying this behavior. In this paper, we describe the methods used in this article, and show that they are very general, enabling the reader to construct many more such examples, based on the same principles.
