The \emph{canonical structures of the plane} are those that result, up to isomorphism, from the rings that have the form \mathds{R}[x]/(ax^2+bx+c) with a\neq 0.That ring is isomorphic to \mathds{R}[\theta], where \theta is the equivalence class of x, which satisfies \theta^2 = (-\dfrac{c}{a}) + \theta (-\dfrac{b}{a}). On the other hand, it is known that, up to isomorphism, there are only three canonical structures: the corresponding to \theta^2 = -1 (the complex numbers), \theta^2 = 1 (the perplex or hyperbolic numbers) and \theta^2 = 0 (the parabolic numbers). This article copes with the algebraic structure of the rings of integers \mathds{Z}[\theta] in the perplex and parabolic cases by \emph{analogy} to the complex cases: the ring of Gaussian integers. For those rings a \emph{division algorithm} is proved and it is obtained, as a consequence, the characterization of the prime and irreducible elements.
