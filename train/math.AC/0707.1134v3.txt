Let A be a Koszul algebra, and mod A the category of finitely generated graded left A-modules. The "linearity defect" ld_A(M) of M \in mod A is an invariant defined by Herzog and Iyengar. An exterior algebra E is a Koszul algebra which is the Koszul dual S^! of a polynomial ring S. Eisenbud et al. showed that ld_E(M) < \infty for all M \in mod E. Improving their result, we show the following (and many other facts):   (*) If A is a Koszul complete intersection, then reg_{A^!} (M) < \infty and ld_{A^!} (M) < \infty for all M \in mod A^!.   (**) There is a uniform bound of ld(J), where J is a graded ideal of E.
