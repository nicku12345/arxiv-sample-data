Let A be a differential graded algebra with cohomology ring H^*A. A graded module over H^*A is called \emph{realisable} if it is (up to direct summands) of the form H^*M for some differential graded A-module M. Benson, Krause and Schwede have stated a local and a global obstruction for realisability. The global obstruction is given by the Hochschild class determined by the secondary multiplication of the A_{\infty}-algebra structure of H^*A.   In this thesis we mainly consider differential graded algebras A with graded-commutative cohomology ring. We show that a finitely presented graded H^*A-module X is realisable if and only if its \mathfrak{p}-localisation X_{\mathfrak{p}} is realisable for all graded prime ideals \mathfrak{p} of H^*A.   In order to obtain such a local-global principle also for the global obstruction, we define the \emph{localisation of a differential graded algebra A at a graded prime \mathfrak{p} of H^*A}, denoted by A_{\mathfrak{p}}, and show the existence of a morphism of differential graded algebras inducing the canonical map H^*A \to (H^*A)_{\mathfrak{p}} in cohomology. The latter result actually holds in a much more general setting: we prove that every smashing localisation on the derived category of a differential graded algebra is induced by a morphism of differential graded algebras.   Finally we discuss the relation between realisability of modules over the group cohomology ring and the Tate cohomology ring.
