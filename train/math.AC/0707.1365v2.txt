Let I be a homogeneous Artinian ideal in a polynomial ring R=k[x_1,...,x_n] over a field k of characteristic 0. We study an equivalent condition for the generic initial ideal \gin(I) with respect to reverse lexicographic order to be almost reverse lexicographic. As a result, we show that Moreno-Socias conjecture implies Fr\"{o}berg conjecture. And for the case \Codim I \le 3, we show that R/I has the strong Lefschetz property if and only if \gin(I) is almost reverse lexicographic. Finally for a monomial complete intersection Artinian ideal I=(x_1^{d_1},...,x_n^{d_n}), we prove that \gin(I) is almost reverse lexicographic if d_i > \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} d_j - i + 1 for each i \ge 4. Using this, we give a positive partial answer to Moreno-Socias conjecture, and to Fr\"{o}berg conjecture.
