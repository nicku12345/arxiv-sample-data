Let R be a local ring and let (x_1\biss x_r) be part of a system of parameters of a finitely generated R-module M, where r < \dim_R M. We will show that if (y_1\biss y_r) is part of a reducing system of parameters of M with (y_1\biss y_r)M=(x_1\biss x_r)M then (x_1\biss x_r) is already reducing. Moreover, there is such a part of a reducing system of parameters of M iff for all primes P\in \supp M \cap V_R(x_1\biss x_r) with \dim_R R/P = \dim_R M -r the localization M_P of M at P is an r-dimensional \cm\ module over R_P. Furthermore, we will show that M is a \cm module iff y_d is a non zero divisor on M/(y_1\biss y_{d-1})M, where (y_1\biss y_d) is a reducing system of parameters of M (d := \dim_R M).
