We introduce the k-strong Lefschetz property (k-SLP) and the k-weak Lefschetz property (k-WLP) for graded Artinian K-algebras, which are generalizations of the Lefschetz properties. The main results obtained in this paper are as follows:   1. Let I be a graded ideal of R=K[x_1, x_2, x_3] whose quotient ring R/I has the SLP. Then the generic initial ideal of I is the unique almost revlex ideal with the same Hilbert function as R/I.   2. Let I be a graded ideal of R=K[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] whose quotient ring R/I has the n-SLP. Suppose that all k-th differences of the Hilbert function of R/I are quasi-symmetric. Then the generic initial ideal of I is the unique almost revlex ideal with the same Hilbert function as R/I.   3. We give a sharp upper bound on the graded Betti numbers of Artinian K-algebras with the k-WLP and a fixed Hilbert function.
