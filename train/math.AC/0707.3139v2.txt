In this note we develop some of the properties of separators of points in a multiprojective space. In particular, we prove multigraded analogs of results of Geramita, Maroscia, and Roberts relating the Hilbert function of X and X \{P} via the degree of a separator, and Abrescia, Bazzotti, and Marino relating the degree of a separator to shifts in the minimal multigraded free resolution of the ideal of points.
