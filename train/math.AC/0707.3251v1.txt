Let X be a smooth projective variety with torsion-free Picard group. We introduce complexes of vector spaces whose homology determines the structure of the minimal free resolution of the Cox ring of X over the polynomial ring and show how the homology of these complexes can be studied by purely geometric methods. As an application of these techniques we give a simple new proof of a characterization of the Cox rings of Del Pezzo surfaces (of degree >1) conjectured by Batyrev and Popov.
