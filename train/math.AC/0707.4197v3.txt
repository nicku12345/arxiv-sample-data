Let (R,\m) and (S,\n) be commutative Noetherian local rings, and let \phi:R\to S be a flat local homomorphism such that \m S = \n and the induced map on residue fields R/\m \to S/\n is an isomorphism. Given a finitely generated R-module M, we show that M has an S-module structure compatible with the given R-module structure if and only if \Ext^i_R(S,M)=0 for each i\ge 1.   We say that an S-module N is {\it extended} if there is a finitely generated R-module M such that N\cong S\otimes_RM. Given a short exact sequence 0 \to N_1\to N \to N_2\to 0 of finitely generated S-modules, with two of the three modules N_1,N,N_2 extended, we obtain conditions forcing the third module to be extended. We show that every finitely generated module over the Henselization of R is a direct summand of an extended module, but that the analogous result fails for the \m-adic completion.
