We study several deformation functors associated to the normalization of a reduced curve singularity (X,0) \subset (\c^n,0). The main new results are explicit formulas, in terms of classical invariants of (X,0), for the cotangent cohomology groups T^i, i = 0,1,2, of these functors. Thus we obtain precise statements about smoothness and dimension of the corresponding local moduli spaces. We apply the results to obtain explicit formulas resp. estimates for the \hoa{A}_e-codimension of a parametrized curve singularity, where \hoa{A}_e denotes the Mather-Wall group of left-right equivalence.
