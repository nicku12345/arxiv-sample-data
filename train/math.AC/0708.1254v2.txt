We give a new definition of smooth toric DM stacks in the same spirit of toric varieties. We show that our definition is equivalent to the one of Borisov, Chen and Smith in terms of stacky fans. In particular, we give a geometric interpretation of the combinatorial data contained in a stacky fan. We also give a bottom up classification in terms of simplicial toric varieties and fiber products of root stacks.
