Recently, Shestakov-Umirbaev solved Nagata's conjecture on an automorphism of a polynomial ring. To solve the conjecture, they defined notions called reductions of types I--IV for automorphisms of a polynomial ring. An automorphism admitting a reduction of type I was first found by Shestakov-Umirbaev. Using a computer, van den Essen--Makar-Limanov--Willems gave a family of such automorphisms. In this paper, we present a new construction of such automorphisms using locally nilpotent derivations. As a consequence, we discover that there exists an automorphism admitting a reduction of type I which satisfies some degree condition for each possible value.
