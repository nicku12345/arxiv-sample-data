The F-threshold c^J(\a) of an ideal \a with respect to the ideal J is a positive characteristic invariant obtained by comparing the powers of \a with the Frobenius powers of J. We show that under mild assumptions, we can detect the containment in the integral closure or the tight closure of a parameter ideal using F-thresholds. We formulate a conjecture bounding c^J(\a) in terms of the multiplicities e(\a) and e(J), when \a and J are zero-dimensional ideals, and J is generated by a system of parameters. We prove the conjecture when J is a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring, and also when \a and J are generated by homogeneous systems of parameters in a Cohen-Macaulay graded k-algebra.
