Let A be a ring of dimension d and let P be a projective A-module of rank d. We prove that if for every finite extension R of A, R^d is cancellative, then P is cancellative. This gives an alternate proof of Bhatwadekar's result: every projective module of rank d over an affine algebra of dimension d over a C_1-field of characteristic 0 is cancellative.   Let P be a projective module of rank d-1 over an affine agebra of dimension d over an algebraically closed field. Then, it is not known if P is cancellative. We prove some results in this direction also.
