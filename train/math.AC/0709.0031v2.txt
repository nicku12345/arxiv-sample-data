In this note, we study Serre's property (S_i), and its relation to Alexander duality for monomial ideals in a polynomial ring over a field. We describe ideals that define the non-Cohen-Macaulay- and the non-(S_i)-loci of finitely generated modules over regular rings, and show that minimal prime ideals in these loci are homogeneous, in the graded case. We show that a square-free monomial ideal has property (S_i) if and only if its Alexander dual has a linear resolution up to homological degree i-1. We prove that for square-free monomial ideals, having property (S_2) is equivalent to being locally connected in codimension 1.
