Let the finite group G act linearly on the vector space V over the field k of arbitrary characteristic. If H<G is a subgroup the extension of invariant rings k[V]^G\subset k[V]^H is studied using modules of covariants.   An example of our results is the following. Let W be the subgroup of G generated by the reflections in G. A classical theorem due to Serre says that if k[V] is a free k[V]^G-module then G=W. We generalize this result as follows. If k[V]^H is a free k[V]^G-module then G is generated by H and W, and the invariant ring k[V]^{H\cap W} is free over k[V]^W and generated as an algebra by H-invariants and W-invariants.
