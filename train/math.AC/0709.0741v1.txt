Let K be a field admitting a cyclic Galois extension of degree n. The main result of this paper is a decomposition theorem for the space of alternating bilinear forms defined on a vector space of odd dimension n over K. We show that this space of forms is the direct sum of (n-1)/2 subspaces, each of dimension n, and the non-zero elements in each subspace have constant rank defined in terms of the orders of the Galois automorphisms. Furthermore, if ordered correctly, for each integer k lying between 1 and (n-1)/2, the rank of any non-zero element in the sum of the first k subspaces is at most n-2k+1. Slightly less sharp similar results hold for cyclic extensions of even degree.
