Let X be an arbitrary projective scheme over a field k. Let A be the local ring at the vertex of the affine cone for some embedding \iota: X\hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k. G. Lyubeznik asked (in \cite{l2}) whether the integers \lambda_{i,j}(A) (defined in \cite{l1}), called the Lyubeznik numbers of A, depend only on X, but not on the embedding. In this paper, we make a big step toward a positive answer to this question by proving that in positive characteristic, for a fixed X, the Lyubezink numbers \lambda_{i,j}(A) of the local ring A, can only achieve finitely many possible values under all choices of embeddings.
