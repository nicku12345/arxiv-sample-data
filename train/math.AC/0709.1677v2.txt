We give a class of examples of vector bundles on a relative smooth projective curve over Spec Z such that for infinitely many prime reductions the bundle has a Frobenius descent, but the restriction to the generic fiber in characteristic zero is not semistable. In the third section of the paper we prove for a large class of varieties (including abelian varieties) that any vector bundle with this Frobenius descent property is generically semistable.
