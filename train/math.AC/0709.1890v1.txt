Let {\mathcal C}= \bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i \subseteq \mathbb{P}^2 be a collection of smooth rational plane curves. We prove that the addition-deletion operation used in the study of hyperplane arrangements has an extension which works for a large class of arrangements of smooth rational curves, giving an inductive tool for understanding the freeness of the module \Omega^1({\mathcal C}) of logarithmic differential forms with pole along {\mathcal C}. We also show that the analog of Terao's conjecture (freeness of \Omega^1({\mathcal C}) is combinatorially determined if {\mathcal C} is a union of lines) is false in this setting.
