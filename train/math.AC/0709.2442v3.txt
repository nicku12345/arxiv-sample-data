Let R be a local ring and M a finitely generated R-module. The complete intersection dimension of M--defined by Avramov, Gasharov and Peeva, and denoted \cidim_R(M)--is a homological invariant whose finiteness implies that M is similar to a module over a complete intersection. It is related to the classical projective dimension and to Auslander and Bridger's Gorenstein dimension by the inequalities \gdim_R(N)\leq\cidim_R(N)\leq\pd_R(N).   Using Blanco and Majadas' version of complete intersection dimension for local ring homomorphisms, we prove the following generalization of a theorem of Avramov and Foxby: Given local ring homomorphisms \phi\colon R\to S and \psi\colon S\to T such that \phi has finite Gorenstein dimension, if \psi has finite complete intersection dimension, then the composition \psi\circ\phi has finite Gorenstein dimension. This follows from our result stating that, if M has finite complete intersection dimension, then M is C-reflexive and is in the Auslander class \catac(R) for each semidualizing R-complex C.
