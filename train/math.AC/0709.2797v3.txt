Let R be a commutative k-algebra over a field k. Assume R is a noetherian, infinite, integral domain. The group of k-automorphisms of R,i.e.Aut_k(R) acts in a natural way on (R-k).In the first part of this article, we study the structure of R when the orbit space (R-k)/Aut_k(R) is finite.We note that most of the results, not particularly relevent to fields, in [1,\S 2] hold in this case as well. Moreover, we prove that R is a field. In the second part, we study a special case of the Conjecture 2.1 in [1] : If K/k is a non trivial field extension where k is algebraically closed and \mid (K-k)/Aut_k(K) \mid = 1 then K is algebraically closed. In the end, we give an elementary proof of [1,Theorem 1.1] in case K is finitely generated over its prime subfield.
