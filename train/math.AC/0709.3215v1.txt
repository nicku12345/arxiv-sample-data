The article is devoted to stochastic processes with values in finite-dimensional vector spaces over infinite locally compact fields with non-trivial non-archimedean valuations. Infinitely divisible distributions are investigated. Theorems about their characteristic functionals are proved. Particular cases are demonstrated.
