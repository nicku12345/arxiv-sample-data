This third paper,devoted to global correspondences of Langlands,bears more particularly on geometric-shifted bilinear correspondences on mixed (bi)motives generated under the action of the products,right by left,of differential elliptic operators.The mathematical frame,underlying these correspondences,deals with the categories of the Suslin-Voevodsky mixed (bi)motives and of the Chow mixed (bi)motives which are both in one-to-one correspondence with the functional representation spaces of the shifted algebraic bilinear semigroups.A bilinear holomorphic and supercuspidal spectral representation of an elliptic bioperator is then developed.
