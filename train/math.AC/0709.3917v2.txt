Let R=\oplus_{i\geq 0} R_i be an Artinian standard graded K-algebra defined by quadrics. Assume that \dim R_2\leq 3 and that K is algebraically closed of characteristic \neq 2. We show that R is defined by a Gr\"obner basis of quadrics with, essentially, one exception. The exception is given by K[x,y,z]/I where I is a complete intersection of 3 quadrics not containing the square of a linear form.
