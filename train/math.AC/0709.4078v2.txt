For finitely generated module M over a local ring R, the conventional notions of complete intersection dimension \cid_R M and Cohen-Macaulay dimension \cmdim_R M do not extend to cover the case of infinitely generated modules. In this paper we introduce similar invariants for not necessarily finitely generated modules, (namely, complete intersection flat and Cohen-Macaulay flat dimensions) which for finitely generated modules, coincide with the corresponding classical ones.
