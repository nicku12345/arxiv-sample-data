Let (R, m) be a d-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring.   In this note we prove, in a very elementary way, an upper bound of the first normalized Hilbert coefficient of a m-primary ideal I\subset R that improves all known upper bounds unless for a finite number of cases. We also provide new upper bounds of the Hilbert functions of I extending the known bounds for the maximal ideal.
