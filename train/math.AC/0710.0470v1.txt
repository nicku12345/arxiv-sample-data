The purpose of this article is to give, for any commutative ring A, an explicit minimal set of generators for the ring of multisymmetric functions TS^d_A(A[x_1,...,x_r]) as an A-algebra. In characteristic zero, i.e. when A is an algebra over the rational numbers, a minimal set of generators has been known since the 19th century. A rather small generating set in the general case has also recently been given by Vaccarino but it is not minimal in general. We also give a sharp degree bound on the generators, improving the degree bound previously obtained by Fleischmann.
