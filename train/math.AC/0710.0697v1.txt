We give a characteristic free proof of the main result of our previous paper (math.AC/0509697) concerning toroidalization of generating sequences of valuations in dimension two function fields. We show that when an extension of two dimensional algebraic regular local rings R\subset S satisfies the conclusions of the Strong Monomialization theorem of Cutkosky and Piltant, the map between generating sequences in R and S has a toroidal structure.
