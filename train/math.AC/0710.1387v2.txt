Quasi-socle ideals, that is the ideals I of the form I= Q : \mathfrak{m}^q in a Noetherian local ring (A, \mathfrak{m}) with the Gorenstein tangent cone \mathrm{G}(\mathfrak{m}) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0}{\mathfrak{m}}^n/{\mathfrak{m}}^{n+1} are explored, where q \geq 1 is an integer and Q is a parameter ideal of A generated by monomials of a system x_1, x_2, ..., x_d of elements in A such that (x_1, x_2, ..., x_d) is a reduction of \mathfrak{m}. The questions of when I is integral over Q and of when the graded rings \mathrm{G}(I) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0}I^n/I^{n+1} and \mathrm{F}(I) = \bigoplus_{n \ge 0}I^n/\mathfrak{m} I^n are Cohen-Macaulay are answered. Criteria for \mathrm{G} (I) and \mathcal{R} (I) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0}I^n to be Gorenstein rings are given.
