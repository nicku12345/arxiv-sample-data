We study the arithmetical ranks and the cohomological dimensions of an infinite class of Cohen-Macaulay varieties of minimal degree. Among these we find, on the one hand, infinitely many set-theoretic complete intersections, on the other hand examples where the arithmetical rank is arbitrarily greater than the codimension.
