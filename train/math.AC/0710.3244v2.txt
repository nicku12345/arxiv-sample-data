We investigate monomial labellings on cell complexes, giving a minimal cellular resolution of the ideal generated by these monomials, and such that the associated quotient ring is Cohen-Macaulay. We introduce a notion of such a labelling being maximal. There is only a finite number of maximal labellings for each cell complex, and we classify these for trees, partly for subdivisions of polygons, and for some classes of selfdual polytopes.
