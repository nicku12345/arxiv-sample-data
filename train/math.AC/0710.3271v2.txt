For a vector space V of homogeneous forms of the same degree in a polynomial ring, we investigate what can be said about the generic initial ideal of the ideal generated by V, from the form of the generic initial space gin(V) for the revlex order. Our main result is a considerable generalisation of a previous result by the first author.
