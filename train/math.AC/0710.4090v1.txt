Let (R,\m,k) be a local (Noetherian) ring of positive prime characteristic p and dimension d. Let G_\dt be a minimal resolution of the residue field k, and for each i\ge 0, let \gothic t_i(R) = \lim_{e\to \8} {\length(H_i(F^e(G_\dt)))}/{p^{ed}}. We show that if \gothic t_i(R) = 0 for some i>0, then R is a regular local ring. Using the same method, we are also able to show that if R is an excellent local domain and \Tor_i^R(k,R^+) = 0 for some i>0, then R is regular (where R^+ is the absolute integral closure of R). Both of the two results were previously known only for i = 1 or 2 via completely different methods.
