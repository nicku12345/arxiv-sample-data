Let D be an integral domain with quotient field K and let X be an indeterminate over D. Also, let \boldsymbol{\mathcal{T}}:=\{T_{\lambda}\mid \lambda   \in \Lambda \} be a defining family of quotient rings of D and suppose that \ast  is a finite type star operation on D induced by \boldsymbol{\mathcal{T}}. We show that D is a P \ast MD (resp., PvMD) if and only if (\co_D(fg))^{\ast}=(\co_D(f)\co_D(g))^{\ast} (resp., (\co_D(fg))^{w}=(\co_D(f)\co_D(g))^{w}) for all 0 \ne f,g \in K[X]. A more general version of this result is given in the semistar operation setting. We give a method for recognizing PvMD's which are not P\ast MD's for a certain finite type star operation \ast . We study domains D for which the \ast --class group \Cl^{\ast}(D) equals the t--class group \Cl^{t}(D) for any finite type star operation \ast , and we indicate examples of PvMD's D such that \Cl^{\ast}(D)\subsetneq \Cl^{t}(D). We also compute \Cl^v(D) for certain valuation domains D.
