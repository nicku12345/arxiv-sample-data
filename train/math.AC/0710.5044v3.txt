A free multiarrangement of rank k is defined to be extendable if it is obtained from a simple rank (k+1) free arrangement by the natural restriction to a hyperplane (in the sense of Ziegler). Not all free multiarrangements are extendable. We will discuss extendability of free multiarrangements for a special class. We also give two applications. The first is to produce totally non-free arrangements. The second is to give interpolating free arrangements between extended Shi and Catalan arrangements.
