Suppose that k is an arbitrary field. Consider the field k((x_1,...,x_n)), which is the quotient field of the ring k[[x_1,...,x_n]] of formal power series in the variables x_1,...,x_n, with coefficients in k. Suppose that \sigma is a formal power series in x_1,...,x_n with coefficints in the algebraic closure of k. We give a very simple necessary and sufficient condition for \sigma to be algebraic over k((x_1,...,x_n)).   As an application of our methods, we give a characterization of valuation rings V which dominate an excellent, Noetherian local domain R of dimension two, and such that the rank increases after passing to the completion of a birational extension of R.
