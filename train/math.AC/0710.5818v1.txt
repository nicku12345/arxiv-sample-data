Let R be a local complete intersection and M,N are R-modules such that \ell(\Tor_i^R(M,N))<\infty for i\gg 0. Imitating an approach by Avramov and Buchweitz, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of \ell(\Tor_i^R(M,N)) using Eisenbud operators and show that they have well-behaved growth. We define and study a function \eta^R(M,N) which generalizes Serre's intersection multiplicity \chi^R(M,N) over regular local rings and Hochster's function \theta^R(M,N) over local hypersurfaces. We use good properties of \eta^R(M,N) to obtain various results on complexities of \Tor and \Ext, vanishing of \Tor, depth of tensor products, and dimensions of intersecting modules over local complete intersections.
