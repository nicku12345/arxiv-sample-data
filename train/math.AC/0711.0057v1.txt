We study Gorenstein dimension and grade of a module M over a filtered ring whose assosiated graded ring is a commutative Noetherian ring. An equality or an inequality between these invariants of a filtered module and its associated graded module is the most valuable property for an investigation of filtered rings. We prove an inequality G-dimM\leq{G-dim gr}M and an equality {\rm grade}M={\rm grade gr}M, whenever Gorenstein dimension of {\rm gr}M is finite (Theorems 2.3 and 2.8). We would say that the use of G-dimension adds a new viewpoint for studying filtered rings and modules. We apply these results to a filtered ring with a Cohen-Macaulay or Gorenstein associated graded ring and study a Cohen-Macaulay, perfect or holonomic module.
