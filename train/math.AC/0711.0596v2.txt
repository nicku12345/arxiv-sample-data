Let A be a finitely generated commutative algebra over a field K with a presentation A=K < X_{1}, ..., X_{n} | R >, where R is a set of monomial relations in the generators X_{1}, ..., X_{n}. So A = K[S], the semigroup algebra of the monoid S=< X_{1}, ..., X_{n} | R >. We characterize, purely in terms of the defining relations, when A is an integrally closed domain, provided R contains at most two relations. Also the class group of such algebras A is calculated.
