A weaker form of the multiplicity conjecture of Herzog, Huneke, and Srinivasan is proven for two classes of monomial ideals: quadratic monomial ideals and squarefree monomial ideals with sufficiently many variables relative to the Krull dimension. It is also shown that tensor products, as well as Stanley-Reisner ideals of certain unions, satisfy the multiplicity conjecture if all the components do. Conditions under which the bounds are achieved are also studied.
