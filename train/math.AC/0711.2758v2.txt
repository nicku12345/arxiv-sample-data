We prove that the incidence scheme of rational curves of degree 11 on quintic threefolds is irreducible. This implies a strong form of the Clemens conjecture in degree 11. Namely, on a general quintic threefold F in \mathbb{P}^4, there are only finitely many smooth rational curves of degree 11, and each curve C is embedded in F with normal bundle \mathcal{O}(-1) \oplus \mathcal{O}(-1). Moreover, in degree 11, there are no singular, reduced, and irreducible rational curves, nor any reduced, reducible, and connected curves with rational components on F.
