Consider a pair (R, \ba^t) where R is a ring of positive characteristic, \ba is an ideal such that a \cap R^{\circ} \neq \emptyset, and t > 0 is a real number. In this situation we have the ideal \tau_R(\ba^t), the generalized test ideal associated to (R, a^t) as defined by Hara and Yoshida. We show that \tau_R(a^t) \cap R^{\circ} is made up of appropriately defined generalized test elements which we call \emph{sharp test elements}. We also define a variant of F-purity for pairs, \emph{sharp F-purity}, which interacts well with sharp test elements and agrees with previously defined notions of F-purity in many common situations. We show that if (R, \ba^t) is sharply F-pure, then \tau_R(\ba^t) is a radical ideal. Furthermore, by following an argument of Vassilev, we show that if R is a quotient of an F-finite regular local ring and (R, \ba^t) is sharply F-pure, then R/{\tau_R(\ba^t)} itself is F-pure. We conclude by showing that sharp F-purity can be used to define the F-pure threshold. As an application we show that the F-pure threshold must be a rational number under certain hypotheses.
