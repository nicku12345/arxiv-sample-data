A non-zero constant Jacobian polynomial map F=(P,Q):\mathbb{C}^2 \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}^2 has a polynomial inverse if the component P is a simple polynomial, i.e. if, when P extended to a morphism p:X\longrightarrow \mathbb{P}^1 of a compactification X of \mathbb{C}^2, the restriction of p to each irreducible component C of the compactification divisor D = X-\mathbb{C}^2 is either degree 0 or 1.
