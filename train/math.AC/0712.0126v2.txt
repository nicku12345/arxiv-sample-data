In this paper, we extend the well-known Hilbert's syzygy theorem to the Gorenstein homological dimensions of rings. Also, we study the Gorenstein homological dimensions of direct product of rings, which gives examples of non-Noetherian rings of finite Gorenstein dimensions and infinite classical weak dimension.
