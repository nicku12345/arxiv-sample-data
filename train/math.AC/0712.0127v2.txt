One of the main results of this paper is the characterization of the rings over which all modules are strongly Gorenstein projective. We show that these kinds of rings are very particular cases of the well-known quasi-Frobenius rings. We give examples of rings over which all modules are Gorenstein projective but not necessarily strongly Gorenstein projective.
