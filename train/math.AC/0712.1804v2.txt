Let \Delta be a simplicial complex on V = \{x_1,...,x_n\}, with Stanley-Reisner ideal I_{\Delta}\subseteq R = k[x_1,...,x_n]. The goal of this paper is to investigate the class of artinian algebras A=A(\Delta,a_1,...,a_n)= R/(I_{\Delta},x_1^{a_1},...,x_n^{a_n}), where each a_i \geq 2. By utilizing the technique of Macaulay's inverse systems, we can explicitly describe the socle of A in terms of \Delta. As a consequence, we determine the simplicial complexes, that we will call {\em levelable}, for which there exists a tuple (a_1,...,a_n) such that A(\Delta,a_1,...,a_n) is a level algebra.
