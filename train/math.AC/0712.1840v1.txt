We present a general and comprehensive overview of recent developments in the theory of integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type. The paper covers the following topics: construction of integral models, their possible moduli interpretations, their uniqueness, their smoothness, their properness, and basic stratifications of their special fibres.
