Let J\subset I be monomial ideals. We show that the Stanley depth of I/J can be computed in a finite number of steps. We also introduce the \fdepth of a monomial ideal which is defined in terms of prime filtrations and show that it can also be computed in a finite number of steps. In both cases it is shown that these invariants can be determined by considering partitions of suitable finite posets into intervals.
