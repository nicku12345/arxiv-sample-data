Let (a_n)_{n \geq 0} be a sequence of complex numbers such that its generating series satisfies \sum_{n \geq 0} a_nt^n = \frac{h(t)}{(1-t)^d} for some polynomial h(t). For any r \geq 1 we study the transformation of the coefficient series of h(t) to that of h^{< r >}(t) where \sum_{n \geq 0} a_{nr} t^n = \frac{h^{< r >}(t)}{(1-t)^d}. We give a precise description of this transformation and show that under some natural mild hypotheses the roots of h^{< r >}(t) converge when r goes to infinity. In particular, this holds if \sum_{n \geq 0} a_n t^n is the Hilbert series of a standard graded k-algebra A. If in addition A is Cohen-Macaulay then the coefficients of h^{< r >}(t) are monotonely increasing with r. If A is the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex \Delta then this relates to the rth edgewise subdivision of \Delta which in turn allows some corollaries on the behavior of the respective f-vectors.
