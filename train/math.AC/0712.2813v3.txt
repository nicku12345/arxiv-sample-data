Let B be a nilpotent matrix and suppose that its Jordan canonical form is determined by a partition \lambda. Then it is known that its nilpotent commutator N_B is an irreducible variety and that there is a unique partition \mu such that the intersection of the orbit of nilpotent matrices corresponding to \mu with N_B is dense in N_B. We prove that map D given by D(\lambda)=\mu is an idempotent map. This answers a question of Basili and Iarrobino and gives a partial answer to a question of Panyushev. In the proof, we use the fact that for a generic matrix A \in N_B the algebra generated by A and B is a Gorenstein algebra. Thus, a generic pair of commuting nilpotent matrices generates a Gorenstein algebra. We also describe D(\lambda) in terms of \lambda if D(\lambda) has at most two parts.
