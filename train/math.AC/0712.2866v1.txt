In this paper we are concerned with the finiteness property of Ext-indices of several ring extensions. In this direction, we introduce some conjectures and discuss the relationship of them. Also we give affirmative answers to these conjectures in some special cases. Furthermore, we prove that the trivial extension of an Artinian local ring by its residue class field is always of finite Ext-index and we show that the Auslander-Reiten conjecture is true for this type of rings.
