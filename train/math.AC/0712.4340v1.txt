Over the past few years there has been considerable progress in the structural understanding of special Colombeau algebras. We present some of the main trends in this development: non-smooth differential geometry, locally convex theory of modules over the ring of generalized numbers, and algebraic aspects of Colombeau theory. Some open problems are given and directions of further research are outlined.
