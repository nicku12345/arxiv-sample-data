In this note, we prove that for any finite dimensional vector space V over an algebraically closed field k, and for any finite subgroup G of GL(V) which is either solvable or is generated by pseudo reflections such that the |G| is a unit in k, the projective variety \mathbb P(V)/G is projectively normal with respect to the descent of \mathcal O(1)^{\otimes |G|}.
