A ring R is called left GF-closed, if the class of all Gorenstein flat left R-modules is closed under extensions. The class of left GF-closed rings includes strictly the one of right coherent rings and the one of rings of finite weak dimension.   In this paper, we investigate the Gorenstein flat dimension over left GF-closed rings. Namely, we generalize the fact that the class of all Gorenstein flat left modules is projectively resolving over right coherent rings to left GF-closed rings. Also, we generalize the characterization of Gorenstein flat left modules (then of Gorenstein flat dimension of left modules) over right coherent rings to left GF-closed rings. Finally, using direct products of rings, we show how to construct a left GF-closed ring that is neither right coherent nor of finite weak dimension.
