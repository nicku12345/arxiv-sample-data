Let D be an integral domain and X an indeterminate over D. It is well known that (a) D is quasi-Pr\"ufer (i.e, its integral closure is a Pr\"ufer domain) if and only if each upper to zero Q in D[X]  contains a polynomial g \in D[X] with content \co_D(g) = D; (b) an upper to zero Q in D[X] is a maximal t-ideal if and only if Q contains a nonzero polynomial g \in D[X] with \co_D(g)^v = D. Using these facts, the notions of UMt-domain (i.e., an integral domain such that each upper to zero is a maximal t-ideal) and quasi-Pr\"ufer domain can be naturally extended to the semistar operation setting and studied in a unified frame. In this paper, given a semistar operation \star in the sense of Okabe-Matsuda, we introduce the \star-quasi-Pr\"ufer domains. We give several characterizations of these domains and we investigate their relations with the UMt-domains and the Pr\"ufer v-multiplication domains.
