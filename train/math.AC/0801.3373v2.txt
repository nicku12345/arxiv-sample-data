In two dimensional regular local rings integrally closed ideals have a unique factorization property and have a Cohen-Macaulay associated graded ring. In higher dimension these properties do not hold for general integrally closed ideals and the goal of the paper is to identify a subclass of integrally closed ideals for which they do. We restrict our attention to 0-dimensional homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings R of arbitrary dimension and identify a class of integrally closed ideals, the Goto-class \G^*, that is closed under product and that has a suitable unique factorization property. Ideals in \G^* have a Cohen-Macaulay associated graded ring if either they are monomial or \dim R\leq 3. Our approach is based on the study of the relationship between the notions of integrally closed, contracted, full and componentwise linear ideals.
