In this paper we prove that, for every r \geq 2, the moduli space M^s_X(r;c_1,c_2) of rank r stable vector bundles with Chern classes c_1=rH and c_2=(3r^2-r)/2 on a nonsingular cubic surface X \subset \mathbb{P}^3 contains a nonempty smooth open subset formed by ACM bundles, i.e. vector bundles with no intermediate cohomology. The bundles we consider for this study are extremal for the number of generators of the corresponding module (these are known as Ulrich bundles), so we also prove the existence of indecomposable Ulrich bundles of arbitrarily high rank on X.
