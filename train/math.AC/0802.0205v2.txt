The Chern numbers of the title are the first coefficients (after the multiplicities) of the Hilbert functions of various filtrations of ideals of a local ring (R, \mathfrak{m}). For a Noetherian (good) filtration \mathcal{A} of \mathfrak{m}-primary ideals, the positivity and bounds for e_1(\mathcal{A}) are well-studied if R is Cohen-Macaulay, or more broadly, if R is a Buchsbaum ring or mild generalizations thereof.   For arbitrary geometric local domains, we introduce techniques based on the theory of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules and of extended multiplicity functions to establish the meaning of the positivity of e_1(\mathcal{A}), and to derive lower and upper bounds for e_1(\mathcal{A}).
