Let R be a polynomial ring over a field of characteristic zero and let I \subset R be a graded ideal of height N which is minimally generated by N+1 homogeneous polynomials. If I=(f_1,...,f_{N+1}) where f_i has degree d_i and (f_1,...,f_N) has height N, then the multiplicity of R/I is bounded above by \prod_{i=1}^N d_i - \max\{1, \sum_{i=1}^N (d_i-1) - (d_{N+1}-1) \}.
