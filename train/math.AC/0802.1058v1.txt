The well known g-conjecture for homology spheres follows from the stronger conjecture that the face ring over the reals of a homology sphere, modulo a linear system of parameters, admits the strong-Lefschetz property. We prove that the strong-Lefschetz property is preserved under the following constructions on homology spheres: join, connected sum, and stellar subdivisions. The last construction is a step towards proving the g-conjecture for piecewise-linear spheres.
