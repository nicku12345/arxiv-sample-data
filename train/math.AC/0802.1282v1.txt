We prove a reformulation of the multiplicity upper bound conjecture and use that reformulation to prove it for three-dimensional simplicial complexes and homology manifolds with many vertices. We provide necessary conditions for a Cohen-Macaulay complex with many vertices to have a pure minimal free resolution and a characterization of flag complexes whose minimal free resolution is pure.
