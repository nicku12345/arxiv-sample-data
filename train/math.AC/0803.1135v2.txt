Let k be an algebraically closed field and let \Hilb_{d}^{G}(\p{N}) be the open locus of the Hilbert scheme \Hilb_{d}(\p{N}) corresponding to Gorenstein subschemes. We prove that \Hilb_{d}^{G}(\p{N}) is irreducible for d\le9, we characterize geometrically its singularities for d\le 8 and we give some results about them when d=9 which give some evidence to a conjecture on the nature of the singular points in \Hilb_{d}^{G}(\p{N}).
