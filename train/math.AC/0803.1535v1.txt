In this paper we consider reduced homogeneous ideals \Jcal\subset S of a polynomial ring S, having a 2-linear resolution.   1. We study systems of generators of \Jcal\subset S.   2. We compute the arithmetical rank for a large class of projective curves having a 2-linear resolution.   3. We show that the fiber cone \proj \Fcal(I_{\Lcal}) of a lattice ideal I_{\Lcal} of codimension two is a set theoretical complete intersection.
