Let A be a subvariety of affine space \mathbb{A}^n whose irreducible components are d-dimensional linear or affine subspaces of \mathbb{A}^n. Denote by D(A)\subset\mathbb{N}^n the set of exponents of standard monomials of A. We show that the combinatorial object D(A) reflects the geometry of A in a very direct way. More precisely, we define a d-plane in \mathbb{N}^n as being a set \gamma+\oplus_{j\in J}\mathbb{N}e_{j}, where #J=d and \gamma_{j}=0 for all j\in J. We call the d-plane thus defined to be parallel to \oplus_{j\in J}\mathbb{N}e_{j}. We show that the number of d-planes in D(A) equals the number of components of A. This generalises a classical result, the finiteness algorithm, which holds in the case d=0. In addition to that, we determine the number of all d-planes in D(A) parallel to \oplus_{j\in J}\mathbb{N}e_{j}, for all J. Furthermore, we describe D(A) in terms of the standard sets of the intersections A\cap\{X_{1}=\lambda\}, where \lambda runs through \mathbb{A}^1.
