For each variety in positive characteristic, there is a series of canonically defined blowups, called F-blowups. We are interested in the question of whether the e+1-th blowup dominates the e-th, locally or globally. It is shown that the answer is affirmative (globally for any e) when the given variety is F-pure. As a corollary, we obtain some result on the stability of the sequence of F-blowups. We also give a sufficient condition for local domination.
