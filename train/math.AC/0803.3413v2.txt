We study a number of conditions on the Hilbert function of a level artinian algebra which imply the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP). Possibly the most important open case is whether a codimension 3 SI-sequence forces the WLP for level algebras. In other words, does every codimension 3 Gorenstein algebra have the WLP? We give some new partial answers to this old question: we prove an affirmative answer when the initial degree is 2, or when the Hilbert function is relatively small. Then we give a complete answer to the question of what is the largest socle degree forcing the WLP.
