An explicit lattice point realization is provided for the primary components of an arbitrary binomial ideal in characteristic zero. This decomposition is derived from a characteristic-free combinatorial description of certain primary components of binomial ideals in affine semigroup rings, namely those that are associated to faces of the semigroup. These results are intimately connected to hypergeometric differential equations in several variables.
