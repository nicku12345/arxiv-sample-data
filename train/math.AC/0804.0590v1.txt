If V is an equidimensional codimension c subscheme of an n-dimensional projective space, and V is linked to V' by a complete intersection X, then we say that V is {\em minimally linked} to V' if X is a codimension c complete intersection of smallest degree containing V. Gaeta showed that if V is any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM) subscheme of codimension two then there is a finite sequence of minimal links beginning with V and arriving at a complete intersection. We extend this work in the following ways: 1) In the codimension 2 non-ACM case, we show that for any n \geq 3 there are examples of subschemes that are not minimal in their even liaison class, and cannot be minimally linked in any number of steps to a minimal subscheme. 2) Nevertheless, there are examples of non-ACM liaison classes of curves in projective 3-space where all elements are minimally linked in a finite number of steps to a minimal curve. 3) Extending previous work of the authors with Huneke and Ulrich (about the licci case), we show that also in the non-ACM case in any higher codimension there are non-minimal subschemes that are not minimally linked to a minimal subscheme in the even liaison class. 4) J. Watanabe had shown many years ago that codimension 3 graded Gorenstein ideals of any dimension are licci. Here we show that any such ideal is minimally linked in a finite number of steps to a complete intersection, and that it admits a sequence of strictly decreasing CI-biliaisons down to a complete intersection, extending work of Hartshorne, Sabadini and Schlesinger.
