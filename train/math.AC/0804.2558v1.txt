An ideal I of a local Gorenstein ring (R, \mathfrak m) is called cohomologically complete intersection whenever H^i_I(R) = 0 for all i \not= \height I. Here H^i_I(R), i \in \mathbb Z, denotes the local cohomology of R with respect to I. For instance, a set-theoretic complete intersection is a cohomologically complete intersection. Here we study cohomologically complete intersections from various homological points of view, in particular in terms of their Bass numbers of H^c_I(R), c = \height I. As a main result it is shown that the vanishing H^i_I(R) = 0 for all i \not= c is completely encoded in homological properties of H^c_I(R), in particular in its Bass numbers.
