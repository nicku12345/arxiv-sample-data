Let X be a reduced closed subscheme in \mathbb P^n. As a slight generalization of property \textbf{N}_p due to Green-Lazarsfeld, we can say that X satisfies property \textbf{N}_{2,p} scheme-theoretically if there is an ideal I generating the ideal sheaf \mathcal I_{X/\P^n} such that I is generated by quadrics and there are only linear syzygies up to p-th step (cf. \cite{EGHP1}, \cite{EGHP2}, \cite{V}). Recently, many algebraic and geometric results have been proved for projective varieties satisfying property \textbf{N}_{2,p}(cf. \cite{CKP}, \cite{EGHP1}, \cite{EGHP2} \cite {KP}). In this case, the Castelnuovo regularity and normality can be obtained by the blowing-up method as \reg(X)\le e+1 where e is the codimension of a smooth variety X (cf. \cite{BEL}). On the other hand, projection methods have been very useful and powerful in bounding Castelnuovo regularity, normality and other classical invariants in geometry(cf. \cite{BE}, \cite{K}, \cite{KP}, \cite{L} \cite {R}).   In this paper, we first prove the graded mapping cone theorem on partial eliminations as a general algebraic tools and give some applications. Then, we bound the length of zero dimensional intersection of X and a linear space L in terms of graded Betti numbers and deduce a relation between X and its projections with respect to the geometry and syzygies in the case of projective schemes satisfying property \textbf{N}_{2,p} scheme-theoretically. In addition, we give not only interesting information on the regularity of fibers and multiple loci for the case of \textbf{N}_{d,p}, d\ge 2 but also geometric structures for projections according to moving the center.
