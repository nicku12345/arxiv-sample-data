Given a normal surface singularity (X, Q) and a birational morphism to a non- singular surface \pi : X \to S, we investigate the local geometry of the exceptional divisor L of \pi. We prove that the dimension of the tangent space to L at Q equals the number of exceptional components meeting at Q. Consequences relative to the existence of such birational projections contracting a prescribed number of irreducible curves are deduced. A new characterization of minimal singularities is obtained in these terms.
