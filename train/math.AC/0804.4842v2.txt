This paper is mainly devoted to the study of the differentiation index and the order for quasi-regular implicit ordinary differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. We give an algebraic definition of the differentiation index and prove a Jacobi-type upper bound for the sum of the order and the differentiation index. Our techniques also enable us to obtain an alternative proof of a combinatorial bound proposed by Jacobi for the order.   As a consequence of our approach we deduce an upper bound for the Hilbert-Kolchin regularity and an effective ideal membership test for quasi-regular implicit systems. Finally, we prove a theorem of existence and uniqueness of solutions for implicit differential systems.
