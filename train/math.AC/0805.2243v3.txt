A central arrangement \A of hyperplanes in an \ell-dimensional vector space V is said to be {\it totally free} if a multiarrangement (\A, m) is free for any multiplicity  m : \A\to \Z_{> 0}. It has been known that \A is totally free whenever \ell \le 2. In this article, we will prove that there does not exist any totally free arrangement other than the obvious ones, that is, a product of one-dimensional arrangements and two-dimensional ones.
