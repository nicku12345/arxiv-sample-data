A separating algebra is, roughly speaking, a subalgebra of the ring of invariants whose elements distinguish between any two orbits that can be distinguished using invariants. In this paper, we introduce a geometric notion of separating algebra. This allows us to prove that only groups generated by reflections may have polynomial separating algebras, and only groups generated by bireflections may have complete intersection separating algebras.
