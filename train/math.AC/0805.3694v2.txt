We extend in several directions invariant theory results of Chevalley, Shephard and Todd, Mitchell and Springer. Their results compare the group algebra for a finite reflection group with its coinvariant algebra, and compare a group representation with its module of relative coinvariants. Our extensions apply to arbitrary finite groups in any characteristic.
