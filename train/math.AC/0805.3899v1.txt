Let R be a local, Gorenstein ring with algebraically closed residue field k of characteristic 0 and let P_R(z):=\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}\dim_k(\tor_p^R(k,k))z^p be its Poincar\'e series. We compute P_R when R belongs to a particular class defined in the introduction, proving its rationality. As a by--product we prove the rationality of P_R for all local, Gorenstein rings of multiplicity at most 10.
