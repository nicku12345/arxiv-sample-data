Given a well-ordered semi-group \Gamma with a minimal system of generators of ordinal type at most \omega n and of rational rank r, which satisfies a positivity and increasing condition, we construct a zero-dimensional valuation centered on the ring of polynomials with r variables such that the semi-group of the values of the polynomial ring is equal to \Gamma. The construction uses a generalization of Favre and Jonsson's version of MacLane's sequence of key-polynomials.
