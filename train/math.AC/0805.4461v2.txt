Let I be an m-generated complete intersection monomial ideal in S=K[x_1,...,x_n]. We show that the Stanley depth of I is n-\floor{\frac{m}{2}}. We also study the upper-discrete structure for monomial ideals and prove that if I is a squarefree monomial ideal minimally generated by 3 elements, then the Stanley depth of I is n-1.
