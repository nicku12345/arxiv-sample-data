We introduce 2-partitionable clutters as the simplest case of the class of k-partitionable clutters and study some of their combinatorial properties. In particular, we study properties of the rank of the incidence matrix of these clutters and properties of their minors.   A well known conjecture of Conforti and Cornu\'ejols   \cite{ConfortiCornuejols,cornu-book} states: That all the clutters with the packing property have the max-flow min-cut property, i.e. are mengerian. Among the general classes of clutters known to verify the conjecture are: balanced clutters (Fulkerson, Hoffman and Oppenheim \cite{FulkersonHoffmanOppenheim}), binary clutters (Seymour \cite{Seymour}) and dyadic clutters (Cornu\'ejols, Guenin and Margot \cite{CornuejolsGueninMargot}). We find a new infinite family of 2-partitionable clutters, that verifies the conjecture.   On the other hand we are interested in studying the normality of the Rees algebra associated to a clutter and possible relations with the Conforti and Cornu\'ejols conjecture. In fact this conjecture is equivalent to an algebraic statement about the normality of the Rees algebra \cite{rocky}.
