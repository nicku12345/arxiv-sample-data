We give a two step method to study certain questions regarding associated graded module of a Cohen-Macaulay (CM) module M w.r.t an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal \mathfrak{a} in a complete Noetherian local ring (A,\mathfrak{m}). The first step, we call it Gorenstein approximation, enables us to reduce to the case when both A,  G_\mathfrak{a}(A) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} \mathfrak{a}^n/\mathfrak{a}^{n+1}  are Gorenstein and M is a maximal CM A-module. The second step consists of analyzing the classical filtration \{Hom_A(M,\mathfrak{a}^n) \}_{\mathbb{Z}} of the dual Hom_A(M,A). We give many applications of this point of view. For instance let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be equicharacteristic and CM. Let a(G_\mathfrak{a}(A)) be the a-invariant of G_\mathfrak{a}(A). We prove:   1. a(G_\mathfrak{a}(A)) = -\dim A iff \mathfrak{a} is generated by a regular sequence.   2. If \mathfrak{a} is integrally closed and a(G_\mathfrak{a}(A)) = -\dim A + 1 then \mathfrak{a} has minimal multiplicity.   We extend to modules a result of Ooishi relating symmetry of h-vectors.
