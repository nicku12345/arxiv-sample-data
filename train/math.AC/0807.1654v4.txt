In this paper, we study a positive characteristic analogue of the centers of log canonicity of a pair (R, \Delta). We call these analogues centers of F-purity. We prove positive characteristic analogues of subadjunction-like results, prove new stronger subadjunction-like results, and in some cases, lift these new results to characteristic zero. Using a generalization of centers of F-purity which we call uniformly F-compatible ideals, we give a characterization of the test ideal (which unifies several previous characterizations). Finally, in the case that \Delta = 0, we show that uniformly F-compatible ideals coincide with the annihilators of the \mathcal{F}(E_R(k))-submodules of E_R(k) as defined by Smith and Lyubeznik.
