Let M be an R-module and c the function from M to the ideals of R defined by c(x) = \cap \lbrace I \colon I \text{is an ideal of} R \text{and} x \in IM \rbrace . M is said to be a content R-module if x \in c(x)M , for all x \in M. B is called a content R-algebra, if it is a faithfully flat and content R-module and it satisfies the Dedekind-Mertens content formula. In this article, we prove some new results for content modules and algebras by using ideal theoretic methods.
