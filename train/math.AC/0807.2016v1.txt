Let G be a finite group and \phi : V\to W an equivariant morphism of finite dimensional G-modules. We say that \phi is faithful if G acts faithfully on \phi(V). The covariant dimension of G is the minimum of the dimension of \bar{\phi(V)} taken over all faithful \phi. In \cite{KS07} we investigated covariant dimension and were able to determine it in many cases. Our techniques largely depended upon finding homogeneous faithful covariants. After publication of \cite{KS07}, the junior author of this article pointed out several gaps in our proofs. Fortunately, this inspired us to find better techniques, involving multihomogeneous covariants, which have enabled us to extend and complete the results, simplify the proofs and fill the gaps of \cite{KS07}.
