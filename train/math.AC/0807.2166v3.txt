We show that \depth(S/I)=0 if and only if \sdepth(S/I)=0, where I\subset S=K[x_1,...,x_n] is a monomial ideal. We give an algorithm to compute the Stanley depth of S/I, where I\subset S=K[x_1,x_2,x_3] is a monomial ideal. Also, we prove that a monomial ideal I\subset K[x_1,x_2,x_3] minimally generated by three monomials has \sdepth(I)=2.
