A well known theorem by Alexander-Hirschowitz states that all the higher secant varieties of V_{n,d} (the d-uple embedding of \mathbb{P}^n) have the expected dimension, with few known exceptions. We study here the same problem for T_{n,d}, the tangential variety to V_{n,d}, and prove a conjecture, which is the analogous of Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem, for n\leq 9. Moreover. we prove that it holds for any n,d if it holds for d=3. Then we generalize to the case of O_{k,n,d}, the k-osculating variety to V_{n,d}, proving, for n=2, a conjecture that relates the defectivity of \sigma_s(O_{k,n,d}) to the Hilbert function of certain sets of fat points in \mathbb{P}^n.
