We introduce a new definition of a generalized logarithmic module of multiarrangements by uniting those of the logarithmic derivation and the differential modules. This module is realized as a logarithmic derivation module of an arrangement of hyperplanes with a multiplicity consisting of both positive and negative integers. We consider several properties of this module including Saito's criterion and reflexivity. As applications, we prove a shift isomorphism and duality of some Coxeter multiarrangements by using the primitive derivation.
