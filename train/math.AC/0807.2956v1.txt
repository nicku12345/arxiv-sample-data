In Commutative Algebra structure results on minimal free resolutions of Gorenstein modules are of classical interest. We define Gorenstein modules of finite length over the weighted polynomial ring via symmetric matrices in divided powers. We show that their graded minimal free resolution is selfdual in a strong sense. Applications include a proof of the dependence of the monoid of Betti tables of Cohen-Macaulay modules on the characteristic of the base field. Moreover we give a new proof of the failure of the generalization of Green's Conjecture to characteristic 2 in the case of general curves of genus 2^n -1.
