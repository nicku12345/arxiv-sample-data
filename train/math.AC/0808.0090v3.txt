To complete the classification theory and the structure theory of varieties of almost minimal degree, that is of non-degenerate irreducible projective varieties whose degree exceeds the codimension by precisely 2, a natural approach is to investigate simple projections of varieties of minimal degree. Let \tilde X \subset {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K be a variety of minimal degree and of codimension at least 2, and consider X_p = \pi_p (\tilde X) \subset {\mathbb P}^r_K where p \in {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K \backslash \tilde X. By \cite{B-Sche}, it turns out that the cohomological and local properties of X_p are governed by the secant locus \Sigma_p (\tilde X) of \tilde X with respect to p.   Along these lines, the present paper is devoted to give a geometric description of the secant stratification of \tilde X, that is of the decomposition of {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K via the types of secant loci. We show that there are exactly six possibilities for the secant locus \Sigma_p (\tilde X), and we precisely describe each stratum of the secant stratification of \tilde X, each of which turns out to be a quasi-projective variety.   As an application, we obtain the classification of all non-normal Del Pezzo varieties by providing a complete list of pairs (\tilde X, p) where \tilde X \subset {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K is a variety of minimal degree, p is a closed point in \mathbb P^{r+1}_K \setminus \tilde X and X_p \subset {\mathbb P}^r _K is a Del Pezzo variety.
