The cosection lemma proved by J. Li and Y.H. Kiem said the intrinsic normal cone lies inside the kernel of any cosection of the obstruction sheaf when the moduli has a perfect obstruction theory. With a definition of higher tangent vectors of a scheme at a point, and a construction of the derived Kodaira Spencer map by K. Behrend and B. Fantechi, we prove a derived version of cosection lemma without perfect obstruction theory condition. As an application we give a short proof of the Kodaira's Principle \textit{ambient cohomology annihilates obstruction} (semiregularity), assuming the existence of locall universal family.
