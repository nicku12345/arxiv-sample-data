Let D be an integral domain and \star a semistar operation stable and of finite type on it. In this paper we define the semistar dimension (inequality) formula and discover their relations with \star-universally catenarian domains and \star-stably strong S-domains. As an application we give new characterizations of \star-quasi-Pr\"{u}fer domains and UMt domains in terms of dimension inequality formula (and the notions of universally catenarian domain, stably strong S-domain, strong S-domain, and Jaffard domains). We also extend Arnold's formula to the setting of semistar operations.
