It is well-known that the point cohomology of the convolution algebra \ell^1({\mathbb Z}_+) vanishes in degrees 2 and above. We sharpen this result by obtaining splitting maps whose norms are bounded independently of the choice of point module. Our construction is a by-product of new estimates on projectivity constants of maximal ideals in \ell^1({\mathbb Z}_+). Analogous results are obtained for some other L^1-algebras which arise from `rank one' subsemigroups of {\mathbb R}_+.
