Every subfield \kk(\phi) of the field of rational functions \kk(x_1,...,x_n) is contained in a unique maximal subfield of the form \kk(\psi). The element \psi is called generative for the element \phi. A subfield of \kk(x_1,...,x_n) is called saturated if it contains a generative element of each its element. We study the saturation property for subfields of invariants \kk(x_1,...,x_n)^G, where G is a finite group of automorphisms of the field \kk(x_1,...,x_n).
