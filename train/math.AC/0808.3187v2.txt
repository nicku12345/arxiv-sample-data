Let R be a commutative ring with {\Bbb{A}}(R) its set of ideals with nonzero annihilator. In this paper and its sequel, we introduce and investigate the {\it annihilating-ideal graph} of R, denoted by {\Bbb{AG}}(R). It is the (undirected) graph with vertices {\Bbb{A}}(R)^*:={\Bbb{A}}(R)\setminus\{(0)\}, and two distinct vertices I and J are adjacent if and only if IJ=(0). First, we study some finiteness conditions of {\Bbb{AG}}(R). For instance, it is shown that if R is not a domain, then {\Bbb{AG}}(R) has ACC (resp., DCC) on vertices if and only if R is Noetherian (resp., Artinian). Moreover, the set of vertices of {\Bbb{AG}}(R) and the set of nonzero proper ideals of R have the same cardinality when R is either an Artinian or a decomposable ring. This yields for a ring R, {\Bbb{AG}}(R) has n vertices (n\geq 1) if and only if R has only n nonzero proper ideals. Next, we study the connectivity of {\Bbb{AG}}(R). It is shown that {\Bbb{AG}}(R) is a connected graph and diam(\Bbb{AG})(R)\leq 3 and if {\Bbb{AG}}(R) contains a cycle, then gr({\Bbb{AG}}(R))\leq 4. Also, rings R for which the graph {\Bbb{AG}}(R) is complete or star, are characterized, as well as rings R for which every vertex of {\Bbb{AG}}(R) is a prime (or maximal) ideal. In Part II we shall study the diameter and coloring of annihilating-ideal graphs.
