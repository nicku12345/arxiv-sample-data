Let (A,\m) be a Noetherian local ring, let M be a finitely generated \CM   A-module of dimension r \geq 2 and let I be an ideal of definition for M. Set L^I(M) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}M/I^{n+1}M. In part one of this paper we showed that L^I(M) is a module over \R, the Rees algebra of I and we gave many applications of L^I(M) to study the associated graded module,   G_I(M). In this paper we give many further applications of our technique; most notable is a reformulation of a classical result due to Narita in terms of the Ratliff-Rush filtration. This reformulation can be extended to all dimensions \geq 2.
