In this note we answer the question raised by D. Goss in [Applications of non-Archimedean integration to the L-series of \tau-sheaves, {\em J. Number Theory,} 110 (2005), no. 1, 83--113] by proving that the group of locally analytic endomorphisms on the 1-units of a locally compact field of characteristic p>0 is isomorphic to the p-adic integers.
