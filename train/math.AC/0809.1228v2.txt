There exist many characterizations of Noetherian Cohen-Macaulay rings in the literature. These characterizations do not remain equivalent if we drop the Noetherian assumption. The aim of this paper is to provide some comparisons between some of these characterizations in non Noetherian case. Toward solving a conjecture posed by Glaz, we give a generalization of the Hochster-Eagon result on Cohen-Macaulayness of invariant rings, in the context of non Noetherian rings.
