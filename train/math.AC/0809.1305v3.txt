Given a stable semistar operation of finite type \star on an integral domain D, we show that it is possible to define in a canonical way a stable semistar operation of finite type \star[X] on the polynomial ring D[X], such that, if n:=\star-\dim(D), then n+1\leq \star[X]\text{-}\dim(D[X])\leq 2n+1. We also establish that if D is a \star-Noetherian domain or is a Pr\"{u}fer \star-multiplication domain, then \star[X]\text{-}\dim(D[X])=\star\text{-}\dim(D)+1. Moreover we define the semistar valuative dimension of the domain D, denoted by \star-\dim_v(D), to be the maximal rank of the \star-valuation overrings of D. We show that \star-\dim_v(D)=n if and only if \star[X_1,...,X_n]-\dim_v(D[X_1,...,X_n])=2n, and that if \star-\dim_v(D)<\infty then \star[X]-\dim_v(D[X])=\star-\dim_v(D)+1. In general \star-\dim(D)\leq\star-\dim_v(D) and equality holds if D is a \star-Noetherian domain or is a Pr\"{u}fer \star-multiplication domain. We define the \star-Jaffard domains as domains D such that \star-\dim(D)<\infty and \star-\dim(D)=\star-\dim_v(D). As an application, \star-quasi-Pr\"{u}fer domains are characterized as domains D such that each (\star,\star')-linked overring T of D, is a \star'-Jaffard domain, where \star' is a stable semistar operation of finite type on T. As a consequence of this result we obtain that a Krull domain D, must be a w_D-Jaffard domain.
