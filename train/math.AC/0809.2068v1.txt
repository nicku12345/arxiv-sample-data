Let Q be a Noetherian ring with finite Krull dimension and let \mathbf{f}= f_1,... f_c be a regular sequence in Q. Set A = Q/(\mathbf{f}). Let I be an ideal in A, and let M be a finitely generated A-module with \projdim_Q M finite. Set \R = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}I^n, the Rees-Algebra of I. Let N = \bigoplus_{j \geq 0}N_j be a finitely generated graded \R-module.   We show that \[\bigoplus_{j\geq 0}\bigoplus_{i\geq 0} \Ext^{i}_{A}(M,N_j) \] is a finitely generated bi-graded module over \Sc = \R[t_1,...,t_c]. We give two applications of this result to local complete intersection rings.
