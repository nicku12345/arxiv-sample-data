When a cone is added to a simplicial complex \Delta over one of its faces, we investigate the relation between the arithmetical ranks of the Stanley-Reisner ideals of the original simplicial complex and the new simplicial complex \Delta'. In particular, we show that the arithmetical rank of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of \Delta' equals the projective dimension of the Stanley-Reisner ring of \Delta' if the corresponding equality holds for \Delta.
