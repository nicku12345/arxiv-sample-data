Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with a canonical module \omega_R. Let I be an \m-primary ideal of R and M, a maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-module. We call the function n\longmapsto \ell (\Hom_R(M,{\omega_R}/{I^{n+1} \omega_R})) the dual Hilbert-Samuel function of M with respect to I. By a result of Theodorescu this function is a polynomial function. We study its first two normalized coefficients.
