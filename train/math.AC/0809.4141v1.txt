Let (R,\fm) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. If R has a canonical module, then there are some interesting results about duality for this situation. In this paper, we show that one can indeed obtain similar these results in the case R has not a canonical module. Also, we give some characterizations of complete big Cohen-Macaulay modules of finite injective dimension and by using it some characterizations of Gorenstein modules over the \fm-adic completion of R are obtained.
