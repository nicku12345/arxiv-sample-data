Let f: A\to B be a ring homomorphism between Noetherian normal integral domains. We establish a general criterion for f to induce a homomorphism Cl(f): Cl(A)\to Cl(B) on divisor class groups. For instance, this criterion applies whenever f has finite flat dimension; this special case generalizes the more classical situations where f is flat or is surjective with kernel generated by an A-regular element. We extend some of Spiroff's work on the kernels of induced maps to this more general setting.
