We expand the notion of core to cl-core for Nakayama closures cl. In the characteristic p>0 setting, when cl is the tight closure, denoted by *, we give some examples of ideals when the core and the *-core differ. We note that *-core(I)= core(I), if I is an ideal in a one-dimensional domain with infinite residue field or if I is an ideal generated by a system of parameters in any Noetherian ring. More generally, we show the same result in a Cohen--Macaulay normal local domain with infinite perfect residue field, if the analytic spread, \ell, is equal to the *-spread and I is G_{\ell} and weakly-(\ell-1)-residually S_2. This last is dependent on our result that generalizes the notion of general minimal reductions to general minimal *-reductions. We also determine that the *-core of a tightly closed ideal in certain one-dimensional semigroup rings is tightly closed and therefore integrally closed.
