In this paper, some results on vanishing and non-vanishing of generalized local cohomology modules are presented and some relations between those modules and, Ext and ordinary local cohomology modules are studied. Also, several cofiniteness propositions for generalized local cohomology modules are established which, among other things, provide an alternative answer to a question in [Y2].
