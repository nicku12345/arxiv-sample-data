Let I denote an ideal of a local Gorenstein ring (R, \mathfrak m). Then we show that the local cohomology module H^c_I(R), c = \height I, is indecomposable if and only if V(I_d) is connected in codimension one. Here I_d denotes the intersection of the highest dimensional primary components of I. This is a partial extension of a result shown by Hochster and Huneke in the case I the maximal ideal. Moreover there is an analysis of connectedness properties in relation to various aspects of local cohomology. Among others we show that the endomorphism ring of H^c_I(R) is a local Noetherian ring if \dim R/I = 1.
