Let A be the homogeneous coordinate ring of a rational normal scroll. The ring A is equal to the quotient of a polynomial ring S by the ideal generated by the two by two minors of a scroll matrix \psi with two rows and \ell catalecticant blocks. The class group of A is cyclic, and is infinite provided \ell is at least two. One generator of the class group is [J], where J is the ideal of A generated by the entries of the first column of \psi. The positive powers of J are well-understood, in the sense that the n^{\text{th}} ordinary power, the n^{th} symmetric power, and the n^{th} symbolic power all coincide and therefore all three n^{th} powers are resolved by a generalized Eagon-Northcott complex. The inverse of [J] in the class group of A is [K], where K is the ideal generated by the entries of the first row of \psi. We study the positive powers of [K]. We obtain a minimal generating set and a Groebner basis for the preimage in S of the symbolic power K^{(n)}. We describe a filtration of K^{(n)} in which all of the factors are Cohen-Macaulay S-modules resolved by generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes. We use this filtration to describe the modules in a finely graded resolution of K^{(n)} by free S-modules. We calculate the regularity of the graded S-module K^{(n)} and we show that the symbolic Rees ring of K is Noetherian.
