Consider an ideal I\subset K[x_1,..., x_n], with K an arbitrary field, generated by monomials of degree two. Assuming that I does not have a linear resolution, we determine the step s of the minimal graded free resolution of I where nonlinear syzygies first appear, we show that at this step of the resolution nonlinear syzygies are concentrated in degree s+3, and we compute the corresponding graded Betti number \beta_{s,s+3}. The multidegrees of these nonlinear syzygies are also determined and the corresponding multigraded Betti numbers are shown to be all equal to 1.
