Maclagan and Smith \cite{MaclaganSmith} developed a multigraded version of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. Based on their definition we will prove in this paper that for a smooth curve C\subseteq \P^a\times\P^b (a, b\geq 2) of bidegree (d_1,d_2) with nondegenerate birational projections the ideal sheaf \mathcal{I}_{C|\P^a\times\P^b} is (d_2-b+1,d_1-a+1)-regular. We also give an example showing that in some cases this bound is the best possible.
