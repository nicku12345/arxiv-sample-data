It is well known that the real and imaginary parts of any holomorphic function are harmonic functions of two variables. In this paper we generalize this property to finite-dimensional commutative algebras. We prove that if some basis of a subspace of a commutative algebra satisfies a polynomial equation then components of a hyperholomorphic function on the subspace are solutions of the respective partial differential equation.
