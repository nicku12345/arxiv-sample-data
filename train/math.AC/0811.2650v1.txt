Unlike the Gorenstein projective and injective dimensions, the majority of results on the Gorenstein flat dimension have been established only over Noetherian (or coherent) rings. Naturally, one would like to generalize these results to any associative ring. In this direction, we show that the Gorenstein flat dimension is a refinement of the classical flat dimension over any ring; and we investigate the relations between the Gorenstein projective dimension and the Gorenstein flat dimension.
