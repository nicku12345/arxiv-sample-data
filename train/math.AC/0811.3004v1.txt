Let F be a characteristic zero differential field with an algebraically closed field of constants, E be a no-new-constant extension of F by antiderivatives of F and let y1, ..., yn be antiderivatives of E. The antiderivatives y1, ..., yn of E are called J-I-E antiderivatives if the derivatives of yi in E satisfies certain conditions. We will discuss a new proof for the Kolchin-Ostrowski theorem and generalize this theorem for a tower of extensions by J-I-E antiderivatives and use this generalized version of the theorem to classify the finitely differentially generated subfields of this tower. In the process, we will show that the J-I-E antiderivatives are algebraically independent over the ground differential field. An example of a J-I-E tower is extensions by iterated logarithms. We will discuss the normality of extensions by iterated logarithms and produce an algorithm to compute its finitely differentially generated subfields.
