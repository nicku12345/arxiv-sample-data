In this paper we introduce p-Ferrer diagram, note that 1- Ferrer diagram are the usual Ferrer diagrams or Ferrer board, and corresponds to planar partitions. To any p-Ferrer diagram we associate a p-Ferrer ideal. We prove that p-Ferrer ideal have Castelnuovo mumford regularity p+1. We also study Betti numbers, minimal resolutions of p-Ferrer ideals. Every p-Ferrer ideal is p-joined ideals in a sense defined in a fortcoming paper \cite{m2}, which extends the notion of linearly joined ideals introduced and developped in the papers \cite{bm2}, \cite{bm4},\cite{eghp} and \cite{m1}. We can observe the connection between the results on this paper about the Poincar\'e series of a p-Ferrer diagram \Phi and the rook problem, which consist to put k rooks in a non attacking position on the p-Ferrer diagram \Phi .
