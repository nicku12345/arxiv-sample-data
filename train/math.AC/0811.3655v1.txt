We consider a set X of distinct points in the n-dimensional projective space over an algebraically closed field k. Let A denote the coordinate ring of X, and let a_i(X)=\dim_k [{\rm Tor}_i^R(A,k)]_{i+1}. Green's Strong Castelnuovo Lemma (SCL) shows that if the points are in general position, then a_{n-1}(X)\neq 0 if and only if the points are on a rational normal curve. Cavaliere, Rossi and Valla conjectured that if the points are not necessarily in general position the possible extension of the SCL should be the following: a_{n-1}(X)\neq 0 if and only if either the points are on a rational normal curve or in the union of two linear subspaces whose dimensions add up to n. In this work we prove the conjecture.
