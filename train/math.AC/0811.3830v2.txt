In this article we study specializations of multigradings and apply them to the problem of the computation of the arithmetical rank of a lattice ideal I_{L_{\mathcal{G}}} \subset K[x_{1},...,x_{n}]. The arithmetical rank of I_{L_{\mathcal{G}}} equals the \mathcal{F}-homogeneous arithmetical rank of I_{L_{\mathcal{G}}}, for an appropriate specialization \mathcal{F} of \mathcal{G}. To the lattice ideal I_{L_{\mathcal{G}}} and every specialization \mathcal{F} of \mathcal{G} we associate a simplicial complex. We prove that combinatorial invariants of the simplicial complex provide lower bounds for the \mathcal{F}-homogeneous arithmetical rank of I_{L_{\mathcal{G}}}.
