We prove that the Stanley--Reisner ideal of the Alexander dual of the subword complexes in Coxeter groups has linear quotients with respect to the lexicographical order of the minimal monomial generators. As a consequence, we obtain a shelling order on the facets of the subword complex. We relate some invariants of the subword complexes or of their dual with invariants of the word. For a particular class of subword complexes, we prove that the Stanley--Reisner ring is a complete intersection ring.
