According to several classical results by Bezout, Sylvester, Cayley, and others, the classical discriminant D_n of degree n polynomials may be expressed as the determinant of a matrix whose entries are much simpler polynomials in the coefficients of f. However, all of the determinantal formulae for D_n appearing in the classical literature are equivalent in the sense that the cokernels of their associated matrices are isomorphic as modules over the associated polynomial ring. This begs the question of whether there exist formulae which are not equivalent to the classical formulae and not trivial in the sense of having the same cokernel as the 1 x 1 matrix (D_n).   In this paper, we construct an explicit non-classical formula: the presentation matrix of the open swallowtail first studied by Arnol'd and Givental. We study the properties of this formula, contrasting them with the properties of the classical formulae.
