Let M be a finite module over a commutative noetherian ring R. For ideals \fa and \fb of R, the relations between cohomological dimensions of M with respect to \fa, \fb, \fa\cap\fb and \fa+ \fb are studied. When R is local, it is shown that M is generalized Cohen-Macaulay if there exists an ideal \fa such that all local cohomology modules of M with respect to \fa have finite lengths. Also, when r is an integer such that 0\leq r< \dim_R(M), any maximal element \fq of the non-empty set of ideals \{\fa : \H_\fa^i(M) is not artinian for some i, i\geq r\} is a prime ideal and that all Bass numbers of \H_\fq^i(M) are finite for all i\geq r.
