Motivated by their impact on homological algebra, the change of rings results have been the subject of several interesting works in Gorenstein homological algebra over Noetherian rings.   In this paper, we investigate the change of rings theorems for the Gorenstein dimensions over arbitrary rings. Namely, by the use of the notion of strongly Gorenstein modules, we extend the well-known first, second, and third change of rings theorems for the classical projective and injective dimensions to the Gorenstein projective and injective dimensions, respectively. Each of the results established, in this paper, for the Gorenstein projective dimension is a generalization of a result established over Noetherian rings and for finitely generated modules.
