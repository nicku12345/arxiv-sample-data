This paper generalize the idea of the authors in J. Pure Appl. Algebra 210 (2007) 437--445. Namely, we define and study a particular case of Gorenstein projective modules. We investigate some change of rings results for this new kind of modules. Examples over not necessarily Noetherian rings are given.
