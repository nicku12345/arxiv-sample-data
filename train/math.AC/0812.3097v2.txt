Let I_{G} \subset K[x_{1},...,x_{m}] be the toric ideal associated to a finite graph G. In this paper we study the binomial arithmetical rank and the G-homogeneous arithmetical rank of I_G in 2 cases: G is bipartite, I_G is generated by quadratic binomials. In both cases we prove that the binomial arithmetical rank and the G-arithmetical rank coincide with the minimal number of generators of I_G.
