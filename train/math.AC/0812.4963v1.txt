Consider a height two ideal,   I, which is minimally generated by m homogeneous forms of degree d in the polynomial ring R=k[x,y]. Suppose that one column in the homogeneous presenting matrix \f of I has entries of degree n and all of the other entries of \f are linear. We identify an explicit generating set for the ideal \Cal A which defines the Rees algebra \Cal R=R[It]; so \Cal R=S/\Cal A for the polynomial ring S=R[T_1,...,T_m]. We resolve \Cal R as an S-module and I^s as an R-module, for all powers s. The proof uses the homogeneous coordinate ring, A=S/H, of a rational normal scroll, with H\subseteq \Cal A. The ideal \Cal AA is isomorphic to the n^{\text{th}} symbolic power of a height one prime ideal K of A. The ideal K^{(n)} is generated by monomials. Whenever possible, we study A/K^{(n)} in place of A/\Cal AA because the generators of K^{(n)} are much less complicated then the generators of \Cal AA. We obtain a filtration of K^{(n)} in which the factors are polynomial rings, hypersurface rings, or modules resolved by generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes. The generators of I parameterize an algebraic curve \Cal C in projective m-1 space. The defining equations of the special fiber ring \Cal R/(x,y)\Cal R yield a solution of the implicitization problem for \Cal C.
