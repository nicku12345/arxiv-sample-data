We first describe a situation in which every graded Betti number in the tail of the resolution of \frac RJ may be read from the socle degrees of \frac RJ. Then we apply the above result to the ideals J and J^{[q]}; and thereby describe a situation in which the graded Betti numbers in the tail of the resolution of R/J^{[q]} are equal to the graded Betti numbers in the tail of a shift of the resolution of R/J.
