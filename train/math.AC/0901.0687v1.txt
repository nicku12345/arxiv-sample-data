We study the properties of F-rationality and F-regularity in multigraded rings and their diagonal subalgebras. The main focus is on diagonal subalgebras of bigraded rings: these constitute an interesting class of rings since they arise naturally as homogeneous coordinate rings of blow-ups of projective varieties.   As a consequence of some of the results obtained here, it is shown that there exist standard bigraded hypersurfaces whose rings of invariants under torus actions have rational singularities, but are not of F-regular type. Another application is the construction of families of rings with divisor class groups that are finitely generated, but not discrete in the sense of Danilov.
