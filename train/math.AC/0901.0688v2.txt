Let R be a polynomial ring in finitely many variables over the integers, and fix an ideal I of R. We prove that for all but finitely prime integers p, the Bockstein homomorphisms on local cohomology, H^k_I(R/pR)\to H^{k+1}_I(R/pR), are zero. This provides strong evidence for Lyubeznik's conjecture which states that the modules H^k_I(R) have a finite number of associated prime ideals.
