Let d \in \N and let M be a finitely generated graded module of dimension \leq d over a Noetherian homogeneous ring R with local Artinian base ring R_0. Let \beg(M), \gendeg(M) and \reg(M) respectively denote the beginning, the generating degree and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of M. If i \in \N_0 and n \in Z, let d^i_M(n) denote the R_0-length of the n-th graded component of the i-th R_+-transform module D^i_{R_+}(M) of M and let K^i(M) denote the i-th deficiency module of M. Our main result says, that \reg(K^i(M)) is bounded in terms of \beg(M) and the "diagonal values" d^j_M(-j) with j = 0,..., d-1. As an application of this we get a number of further bounding results for \reg(K^i(M)).
