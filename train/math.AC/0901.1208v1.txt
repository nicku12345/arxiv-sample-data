Let k be a field,  \mathcal{L}\subset \mathbb{Z}^n be a lattice such that \L\cap \mathbb{N}^n=\{{\bf 0}\}, and I_\L\subset \Bbbk[x_1,..., x_n] the corresponding lattice ideal. We present the generalized Scarf complex of I_\L and show that it is indispensable in the sense that it is contained in every minimal free resolution of R/I_\L.
