The conjugacy class of a generic unimodular 2 by 2 complex matrix is determined by its trace, which may be an arbitrary complex number. In the nineteenth century, it was known that a generic pair (X,Y) of such pairs is determined up to conjugacy by the triple of traces (tr(X),tr(Y),tr(XY), which may be an arbitary element of C^3. This paper gives an elementary and detailed proof of this fact, which was published by Vogt in 1889. The folk theorem describing the extension of a representation to a representation of the index-two supergroup which is a free product of three groups of order two, is described in detail, and related to hyperbolic geometry. When n > 2, the classification of conjugacy-classes of n-tuples in SL(2,C) is more complicated. We describe it in detail when n= 3. The deformation spaces of hyperbolic structures on some simple surfaces S whose fundamental group is free of rank two or three are computed in trace coordinates. (We only consider the two orientable surfaces whose fundamental group has rank 3.)
