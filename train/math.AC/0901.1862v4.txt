In this paper we use Groebner bases theory in order to determine planarity of intersections of two algebraic surfaces in {\bf R}^3. We specially considered plane sections of certain type of conoid which has a cubic egg curve as one of the directrices. The paper investigates a possibility of conic plane sections of this type of conoid.
