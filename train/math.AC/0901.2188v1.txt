Schwede proved very recently in arXiv:0901.1154 that in a quasiprojective scheme X with a fixed Frobenius splitting, there are only finitely many subschemes {Y} that are compatibly split. (A simpler proof has already since been given in arXiv:0901.2098, by Kumar and Mehta.) It follows that their deformations (as compatibly split subschemes) are obstructed.   We give a short proof that if X is projective, its compatibly split subschemes {Y} have no deformations at all (again, as compatibly split subschemes). This reproves Schwede's result in some simple cases.
