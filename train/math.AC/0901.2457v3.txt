It is a longstanding problem in Algebraic Geometry to determine whether the syzygy bundle E_{d_1,..., d_n} on \PP^N defined as the kernel of a general epimorphism \xymatrix{\phi:\cO(-d_1)\oplus...\oplus\cO(-d_n)\ar[r] &\cO} is (semi)stable. In this note, we restrict our attention to the case of syzygy bundles E_{d,n} on \PP^N associated to n generic forms f_1,...,f_n\in K[X_0,X_1,..., X_N] of the same degree d. Our first goal is to prove that E_{d,n} is stable if N+1\le n\le\tbinom{d+2}{2}+N-2. This bound improves, in general, the bound n\le d(N+1) given by G. Hein in \cite{B}, Appendix A.   In the last part of the paper, we study moduli spaces of stable rank n-1 vector bundles on \PP^N containing syzygy bundles. We prove that if N+1\le n\le\tbinom{d+2}{2}+N-2 and N\ne 3, then the syzygy bundle E_{d,n} is unobstructed and it belongs to a generically smooth irreducible component of dimension n\tbinom{d+N}{N}-n^2, if N \geq 4, and n\tbinom{d+2}{2}+n\tbinom{d-1}{2}-n^2, if N=2.
