Let Gr(k,n) be the Pl\"ucker embedding of the Grassmann variety of projective k-planes in \P n. For a projective variety X, let \sigma_s(X) denote the variety of its s-1 secant planes. More precisely, \sigma_s(X) denotes the Zariski closure of the union of linear spans of s-tuples of points lying on X. We exhibit two functions s_0(n)\le s_1(n) such that \sigma_s(Gr(2,n)) has the expected dimension whenever n\geq 9 and either s\le s_0(n) or s_1(n)\le s. Both s_0(n) and s_1(n) are asymptotic to \frac{n^2}{18}. This yields, asymptotically, the typical rank of an element of \wedge^{3} 1pt {\mathbb C}^{n+1}. Finally, we classify all defective \sigma_s(Gr(k,n)) for s\le 6 and provide geometric arguments underlying each defective case.
