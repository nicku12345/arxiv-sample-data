Let f_1,...,f_s \in \mathbb{K}[x_1,...,x_m] be a system of polynomials generating a zero-dimensional ideal \I, where \mathbb{K} is an arbitrary algebraically closed field. We study the computation of "matrices of traces" for the factor algebra \A := \CC[x_1, ..., x_m]/ \I, i.e. matrices with entries which are trace functions of the roots of \I. Such matrices of traces in turn allow us to compute a system of multiplication matrices \{M_{x_i}|i=1,...,m\} of the radical \sqrt{\I}. We first propose a method using Macaulay type resultant matrices of f_1,...,f_s and a polynomial J to compute moment matrices, and in particular matrices of traces for \A. Here J is a polynomial generalizing the Jacobian. We prove bounds on the degrees needed for the Macaulay matrix in the case when \I has finitely many projective roots in \mathbb{P}^m_\CC. We also extend previous results which work only for the case where \A is Gorenstein to the non-Gorenstein case. The second proposed method uses Bezoutian matrices to compute matrices of traces of \A. Here we need the assumption that s=m and f_1,...,f_m define an affine complete intersection. This second method also works if we have higher dimensional components at infinity. A new explicit description of the generators of \sqrt{\I} are given in terms of Bezoutians.
