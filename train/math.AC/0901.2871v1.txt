In this paper we establish a connection between the loop space homology of the generalization of wedge defined by a simplicial complex K (so called polyhedral product) and the homology of certain diagonal arrangements associated with K. We illustrate these results by finding the presentations of those loop homology algebras for certain K generalizing results of Panov-Ray, Papadima-Suciu, Lemaire. Finally, we show that in the case when the functor is applied to suspensions, this homology splitting comes from the stable homotopy splitting of the loop spaces.
