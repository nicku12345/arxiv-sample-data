In this paper polynomial maps are represented by the use of matrices whose entries are numbered by pair of multiindices and a new product of such matrices is introduced. A matrix representation of composition of polynomial maps is given. In the case of real and complex numbers different kind of norms of such matrices are introduced. Properties of these norms with respect to the ordinary and new products are investigated. A generalization of Bombieri's inequality is offered.
