In this paper we study the longstanding conjecture of whether there exists a noninner automorphism of order p for a finite non-abelian p-group. We prove that if G is a finite non-abelian p-group such that G/Z(G) is powerful then G has a noninner automorphism of order p leaving either \Phi(G) or \Omega_1(Z(G)) elementwise fixed. We also recall a connection between the conjecture and a cohomological problem and we give an alternative proof of the latter result for odd p, by showing that the Tate cohomology H^n(G/N,Z(N))\not=0 for all n\geq 0, where G is a finite p-group, p is odd, G/Z(G) is p-central (i.e., elements of order p are central) and N\lhd G with G/N non-cyclic.
