Let S be a finitely generated standard multigraded algebra over an Artinian local ring A; M a finitely generated multigraded S-module. This paper answers to the question when mixed multiplicities of M are positive and characterizes them in terms of lengths of A-modules. As an application, we get results on mixed multiplicities of ideals (Proposition 4.4 and Theorem 4.5), and recover the results of Risler and Teissier [Te](see Remark 4.8), Trung and Verma [TV](see Remark 4.6).
