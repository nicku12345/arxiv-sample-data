Let V be a representation of the modular group \Gamma of dimension p. We show that the \mathbb{Z}-graded space \mathcal{H}(V) of holomorphic vector-valued modular forms associated to V is a free module of rank p over the algebra \mathcal{M} of classical holomorphic modular forms. We study the nature of \mathcal{H} considered as a functor from \Gamma-modules to graded \mathcal{M}-lattices and give some applications, including the calculation of the Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} of \mathcal{H}(V) in some cases.
