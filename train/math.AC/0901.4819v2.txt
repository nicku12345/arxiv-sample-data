We present basic properties of Gr\"obner bases of submodules of a free module of finite rank over a polynomial ring R with coefficients in a graded truncated discrete valuations ring A. As an application, we give a criterion for a finitely generated R-module to be flat over A. Its non-graded version is also given.
