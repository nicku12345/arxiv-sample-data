The Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks rank conjecture proposes lower bounds for the Betti numbers of a graded module M based on the codimension of M. We prove a special case of this conjecture via Boij-Soederberg theory. More specifically, we show that the conjecture holds for graded modules where the regularity of M is small relative to the minimal degree of a first syzygy of M. Our approach also yields an asymptotic lower bound for the Betti numbers of powers of an ideal generated in a single degree.
