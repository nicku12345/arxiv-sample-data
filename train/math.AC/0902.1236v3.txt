In this paper, we define and study a particular case of von Neumann regular notion called a weak von Neumann regular ring. It shown that the polynomial ring R[x] is weak von Neumann regular if and only if R has exactly two idempotent elements. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for  R=A\propto E  to be a weak von Neumann ring. It is also shown that I is a primary ideal imply R/I is a weak von Neumann regular ring.
