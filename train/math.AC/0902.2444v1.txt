For a simplicial complex \Delta, the graded Betti number \beta_{i,j}(k[\Delta]) of the Stanley-Reisner ring k[\Delta] over a field k has a combinatorial interpretation due to Hochster. Terai and Hibi showed that if \Delta is the boundary complex of a d-dimensional stacked polytope with n vertices for d\geq3, then \beta_{k-1,k}(k[\Delta])=(k-1)\binom{n-d}{k}. We prove this combinatorially.
