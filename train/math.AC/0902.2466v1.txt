In this paper, we are concerned with the study of the dimension theory of tensor products of algebras over a field k. We introduce and investigate the notion of generalized AF-domain (GAF-domain for short) and prove that any k-algebra A such that the polynomial ring in one variable A[X] is an AF-domain is in fact a GAF-domain, in particular any AF-domain is a GAF-domain. Moreover, we compute the Krull dimension of A\otimes_kB for any k-algebra A such that A[X] is an AF-domain and any k-algebra B generalizing the main theorem of Wadsworth in [16].
