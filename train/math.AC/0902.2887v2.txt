This paper is devoted to give all the technical constructions and definitions that will lead to the construction of an algorithm of resolution of singularities for binomial ideals.   We construct a resolution function that will provide a resolution of singularities for binomial ideals, over a field of arbitrary characteristic. For us, a binomial ideal means an ideal generated by binomial equations without any restriction, including monomials and p-th powers, where p is the characteristic of the base field.   This resolution function is based in a modified order function, called E-order. The E-order of a binomial ideal is the order of the ideal along a normal crossing divisor E.   The resolution function allows us to construct an algorithm of E-\emph{resolution of binomial basic objects}, that will be a subroutine of the main resolution algorithm.
