Let k be a commutative ring, A a commutative k-algebra and D the filtered ring of k-linear differential operators of A. We prove that: (1) The graded ring \gr D admits a canonical embedding \theta into the graded dual of the symmetric algebra of the module \Omega_{A/k} of differentials of A over k, which has a canonical divided power structure. (2) There is a canonical morphism \vartheta from the divided power algebra of the module of k-linear Hasse-Schmidt integrable derivations of A to \gr D. (3) Morphisms \theta and \vartheta fit into a canonical commutative diagram.
