Let \V be a vector space over a field \F. Assume that the characteristic of \F is \emph{large}, i.e. char(\F)>\dim \V. Let T: \V \to \V be an invertible linear map. We answer the following question in this paper: When does \V admit a T-invariant non-degenerate symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) bilinear form? We also answer the infinitesimal version of this question.   Following Feit-Zuckerman \cite{fz}, an element g in a group G is called real if it is conjugate in G to its own inverse. So it is important to characterize real elements in \G(\V, \F). As a consequence of the answers to the above question, we offer a characterization of the real elements in \G(V, \F).   Suppose \V is equipped with a non-degenerate symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) bilinear form B. Let S be an element in the isometry group I(\V, B). A non-degenerate S-invariant subspace \W of (\V, B) is called orthogonally indecomposable with respect to S if it is not an orthogonal sum of proper S-invariant subspaces. We classify the orthogonally indecomposable subspaces. This problem is nontrivial for the unipotent elements in I(\V, B). The level of a unipotent T is the least integer k such that (T-I)^k=0. We also classify the levels of unipotents in I(\V, B).
