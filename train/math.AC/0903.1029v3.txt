The Gr\"obner stratum of a monomial ideal \id{j} is an affine variety that parametrizes the family of all ideals having \id{j} as initial ideal (with respect to a fixed term ordering). The Gr\"obner strata can be equipped in a natural way of a structure of homogeneous variety and are in a close connection with Hilbert schemes of subvarieties in the projective space \PP^n. Using properties of the Gr\"obner strata we prove some sufficient conditions for the rationality of components of \hilb_{p(z)}^n. We show for instance that all the smooth, irreducible components in \hilb_{p(z)}^n (or in its support) and the Reeves and Stillman component H_{RS} are rational.
