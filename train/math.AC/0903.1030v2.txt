In this paper, we deal with the problem of uniqueness of minimal system of binomial generators of a semigroup ideal. Concretely, we give different necessary and/or sufficient conditions for uniqueness of such minimal system of generators. These conditions come from the study and combinatorial description of the so-called indispensable binomials in the semigroup ideal.
