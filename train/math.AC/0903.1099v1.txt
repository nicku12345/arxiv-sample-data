We provide a complete classification of all tilting modules and tilting classes over almost perfect domains, which generalizes the classifications of tilting modules and tilting classes over Dedekind and 1-Gorenstein domains. Assuming the APD is Noetherian, a complete classification of all cotilting modules is obtained (as duals of the tilting ones).
