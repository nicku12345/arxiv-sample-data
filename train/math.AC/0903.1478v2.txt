In this paper we prove four cases of the vanishing conjecture of differential operators with constant coefficients and also a conjecture on the Laurent polynomials with no holomorphic parts, which were proposed in [Zh3] by the third named author. We also give two examples to show that the generalizations of both the vanishing conjecture and the Duistermaat-van der Kallen theorem [DK] to Laurent formal power series do not hold in general.
