Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring with non-zero identity, \fa an ideal of R, and X an R--module. In this paper, for fixed integers s, t and a finite \fa--torsion R--module N, we first study the membership of \Ext^{s+t}_{R}(N, X) and \Ext^{s}_{R}(N, H^{t}_{\fa}(X)) in Serre subcategories of the category of R--modules. Then we present some conditions which ensure the existence of an isomorphism between them. Finally, we introduce the concept of Serre cofiniteness as a generalization of cofiniteness and study this property for certain local cohomology modules.
