We consider the valued field \mathds{K}:=\mathbb{R}((\Gamma)) of generalized series (with real coefficients and monomials in a totally ordered multiplicative group \Gamma). We investigate how to endow \mathds{K} with a series derivation, that is a derivation that satisfies some natural properties such as commuting with infinite sums (strong linearity) and (an infinite version of) Leibniz rule. We characterize when such a derivation is of Hardy type, that is, when it behaves like differentiation of germs of real valued functions in a Hardy field. We provide a necessary and sufficent condition for a series derivation of Hardy type to be surjective.
