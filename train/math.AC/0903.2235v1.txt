Let R be a noetherian ring, \fa an ideal of R, and M an R--module.   We prove that for a finite module M, if \LC^{i}_{\fa}(M) is minimax for all i\geq r\geq 1, then \LC^{i}_{\fa}(M) is artinian for i\geq r. A Local-global Principle for minimax local cohomology modules is shown. If \LC^{i}_{\fa}(M) is coatomic for i\leq r (M finite) then \LC^{i}_{\fa}(M) is finite for i\leq r. We give conditions for a module, which is locally minimax to be a minimax module. A non-vanishing theorem and some vanishing theorems are proved for local cohomology modules.
