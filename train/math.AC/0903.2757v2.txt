The purpose of this paper is to relate the variety parameterizing completely decomposable homogeneous polynomials of degree d in n+1 variables on an algebraically closed field, called \Split_{d}(\PP n), with the Grassmannian of n-1 dimensional projective subspaces of \PP {n+d-1}. We compute the dimension of some secant varieties to \Split_{d}(\PP n) and find a counterexample to a conjecture that wanted its dimension related to the one of the secant variety to \GG (n-1, n+d-1). Moreover by using an invariant embedding of the Veronse variety into the Pl\"ucker space, then we are able to compute the intersection of \GG (n-1, n+d-1) with \Split_{d}(\PP n), some of its secant variety, the tangential variety and the second osculating space to the Veronese variety.
