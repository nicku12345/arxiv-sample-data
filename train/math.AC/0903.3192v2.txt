Let N_m = x^m + y^m be the m-th Newton polynomial in two variables, for m \geq 1. Dvornicich and Zannier proved that in characteristic zero three Newton polynomials N_a, N_b, N_c are always sufficient to generate the symmetric field in x and y, provided that a,b,c are distinct positive integers such that (a,b,c)=1. In the present paper we prove that in case of prime characteristic p the result still holds, if we assume additionally that a,b,c,a-b,a-c,b-c are prime with p. We also provide a counterexample in the case where one of the hypotheses is missing.   The result follows from the study of the factorization of a generalized Vandermonde determinant in three variables, that under general hypotheses factors as the product of a trivial Vandermonde factor and an irreducible factor. On the other side, the counterexample is connected to certain cases where the Schur polynomials factor as a product of linear factors.
