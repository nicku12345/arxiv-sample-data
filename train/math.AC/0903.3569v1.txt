A matroid complex is a pure complex such that every restriction is again pure. It is a long-standing open problem to classify all possible h-vectors of such complexes. In the case when the complex has dimension 1 we completely resolve this question. We also prove the 1-dimensional case of a conjecture of Stanley that all matroid h-vectors are pure {O}-sequences. Finally, we completely characterize the Stanley-Reisner ideals of 1-dimensional matroid complexes.
