We prove the following theorem characterizing Du Bois singularities. Suppose that Y is smooth and that X is a reduced closed subscheme. Let \pi : \tld Y \to Y be a log resolution of X in Y that is an isomorphism outside of X. If E is the reduced pre-image of X in \tld Y, then X has Du Bois singularities if and only if the natural map \O_X \to R \pi_* \O_E is a quasi-isomorphism. We also deduce Koll\'ar's conjecture that log canonical singularities are Du Bois in the special case of a local complete intersection and prove other results related to adjunction.
