In this paper, we investigate the question of triviality of the rational Chow groups of complete intersections in projective spaces and obtain improved bounds for this triviality to hold. Along the way, we study the dimension and nonemptiness of some Hilbert schemes of fat r-planes contained in a complete intersection Y, generalizing well-known results on the Fano varieties of r-planes contained in Y.
