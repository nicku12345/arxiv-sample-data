The aim of this paper is to revise the theory of clusters of infinitely near points for arbitrary fields. We describe in particular the intersection matrix of such a cluster, we introduce the notion of curvette over an arbitrary field and we relate it to the Hamburger-Noether tableaux associated with curves.
