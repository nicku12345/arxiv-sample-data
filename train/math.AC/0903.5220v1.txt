The main aim of this paper is to investigate new class of rings called, for positive integers n and d, G-(n,d)-rings, over which every n-presented module has a Gorenstein projective dimension at most d. Hence we characterize n-coherent G-(n,0)-rings. We conclude by various examples of G-(n,d)-rings.
