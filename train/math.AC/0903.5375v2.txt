The concepts of tropical-semiring and tropical hypersurface, are extended for an arbitrary ordered group. Then, we define the tropicalization of a polynomial with coefficients in a Krull-valued field. After a close study of the properties of the operator "tropicalization" we conclude with an extension of Kapranov's theorem to algebraically closed fields together with a valuation over an ordered group.
