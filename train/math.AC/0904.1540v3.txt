For a Noetherian local domain R let R^+ be the absolute integral closure of R and let R_{\infty} be the perfect closure of R, when R has prime characteristic. In this paper we investigate the projective dimension of residue rings of certain ideals of R^+ and R_{\infty}. In particular, we show that any prime ideal of R_{\infty} has a bounded free resolution of countably generated free R_{\infty}-modules. Also, we show that the analogue of this result is true for the maximal ideals of R^+, when R has residue prime characteristic. We compute global dimensions of R^+ and R_{\infty} in some cases. Some applications of these results are given.
