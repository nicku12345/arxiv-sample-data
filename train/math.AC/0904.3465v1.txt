Let Q\in \K[x_1,...,x_n] = S be a homogeneous polynomial of degree d. The freeness of the logarithmic derivation module, D(Q), and of its natural generalizations, has been widely studied. In the free case, D(Q) \simeq \bigoplus_{i=1}^n S(-d_i) where the d_i's are the exponents of the module; and as a direct consequence of the Saito-Ziegler criterion, the formula d = \sum_i d_i holds. In this paper we give a generalization of this formula in the non-free case. Moreover, we show that an equivalent formula is also true in the quasi-homogeneous case, and show to what extent it can be generalized for arbitrary polynomials.
