This paper generalize the idea of the authors in \cite{Bennis and Mahdou1}. Namely, we define and study a particular case of modules with Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat dimension less or equal than n\geq 0, which we call, respectively, strongly n-Gorenstein projective, injective and flat modules. These three classes of modules give us a new characterization of the first modules, and they are a generalization of the notions of strongly Gorenstein projective, injective, and flat modules respectively.
