Avramov and Buchweitz proved that for finitely generated modules M and N over a complete intersection local ring R, \Ext^i_R(M,N)=0 for all i\gg 0 implies \Ext^i_R(N,M)=0 for all i\gg 0. In this note we give some generalizations of this result. Indeed we prove the above mentioned result when (1) M is finitely generated and N is arbitrary, (2) M is arbitrary and N has finite length and (3) M is complete and N is finitely generated.
