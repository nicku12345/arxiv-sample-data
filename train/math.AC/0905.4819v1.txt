Let R be a one-dimensional, local, Noetherian domain, \R the integral closure of R in its quotient field and v(R) the value set defined by the usual valuation.   The aim of the paper is to study the non-negative invariant b:=(c-\delta)r- \delta , where c, \delta, r denote the conductor, the length of \R/R and the Cohen Macaulay type, respectively. In particular, the classification of the semigroups v(R) for rings having b\leq 2(r-1) is realized. This method of classification might be successfully utilized with similar arguments but more boring computations in the cases b\leq q(r-1),  for reasonably low values of q. The main tools are type sequences and the invariant k which estimates the number of elements in v(R) belonging to the interval [c-e,c), e being the multiplicity of R.
