In this paper we describe the structure of the tangent cone of a numerical semigroup ring A=k[[S]] \subseteq k[[t]] with multiplicity e (as a module over the Noether normalization determined by the fiber cone of the ideal generated by t^e) in terms of some classical invariants of the corresponding numerical semigroup. Explicit computations are also made by using the GAP system.
