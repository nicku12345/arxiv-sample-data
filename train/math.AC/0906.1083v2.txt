The purpose of this paper is to answer a question raised by Gennady Lyubeznik and Karen Smith. This question involves the finite generation of the following non-commutative algebra.   Let S be any commutative algebra of prime characteristic p. For any S-module M and all e\geq 0 we let \mathcal{F}^e(M) denote the set of all additive functions \phi: M \to M with the property that \phi(s m)=s^{p^e} \phi(m) for all s\in S and m\in M. For all e_1, e_2 \geq 0, and \phi_1\in \mathcal{F}^{e_1}(M), \phi_2\in \mathcal{F}^{e_2}(M) the composition \phi_2 \circ \phi_1 is in \mathcal{F}^{e_1+e_2}(M). Also, each \mathcal{F}^{e}(M) is a module over \mathcal{F}^{0}(M)=\Hom_{S}(M,M) via \phi_0 \phi=\phi_0 \circ \phi. We now define \mathcal{F}(M)=\oplus_{e\geq 0} \mathcal{F}^e(M) and endow it with the structure of a \Hom_{S}(M,M)-algebra with multiplication given by composition.   We construct an example of an Artinian module over a complete local ring S for which \mathcal{F}(M) is not a finitely generated \Hom_{S}(M,M)-algebra, thus giving a negative answer to the question raised by Lyubeznik and Smith.
