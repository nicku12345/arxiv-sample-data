For a monomial ideal I\subset S=K[x_1,...,x_n], we show that \sdepth(S/I)\geq n-g(I), where g(I) is the number of the minimal monomial generators of I. If I=vI', where v\in S is a monomial, then we see that \sdepth(S/I)=\sdepth(S/I'). We prove that if I is a monomial ideal I\subset S minimally generated by three monomials, then I and S/I satisfy the Stanley conjecture. Given a saturated monomial ideal I\subset K[x_1,x_2,x_3] we show that \sdepth(I)=2. As a consequence, \sdepth(I)\geq \sdepth(K[x_1,x_2,x_3]/I)+1 for any monomial ideal in I\subset K[x_1,x_2,x_3].
