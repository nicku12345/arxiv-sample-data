We investigate the least studied class of differential rings -- the class of differential rings of nonzero characteristic. We present the notion of differentially closed quasifield and develop geometrical theory of differential equations in nonzero characteristic. The notions of quasivarieties and their morphisms are scrutinized. Presented machinery is a basis for reduction modulo p for differential equations.
