In this paper we examine the role of four Hilbert functions in the determination of the defining relations of the Rees algebra of almost complete intersections of finite colength. Because three of the corresponding modules are Artinian, some of these relationships are very effective, opening up tracks to the determination of the equations and also to processes of going from homologically defined sets of equations to higher degrees ones assembled by resultants.
