In two recent papers, the author has developed a theory of graded annihilators of left modules over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring over a commutative Noetherian ring R of prime characteristic p, and has shown that this theory is relevant to the theory of test elements in tight closure theory. One result of that work was that, if R is local and the R-module structure on the injective envelope E of the simple R-module can be extended to a structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring, then R is F-pure and has a tight closure test element. One of the central results of this paper is the converse, namely that, if R is F-pure, then E has a structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring; a corollary is that every F-pure local ring of prime characteristic, even if it is not excellent, has a tight closure test element. These results are then used, along with embedding theorems for modules over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring, to show that every excellent (not necessarily local) F-pure ring of characteristic p must have a so-called `big' test element.
