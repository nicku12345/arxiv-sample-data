We determine the class of Hilbert series H so that if M is a finitely generated zero-dimensional R-graded module with the strong Lefschetz property, then the tensor product of M and k[y]/(y^m) has the strong Lefschetz property for y an indeterminate and all positive integers m if and only if the Hilbert series of M is in H. Given two finite graded R-modules M and N with the strong Lefschetz property, we determine sufficient conditions in order that the tensor product of M and N has the strong Lefschetz property.
