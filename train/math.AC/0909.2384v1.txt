In \cite{Ouarghi}, the authors discuss the rings over which all modules are strongly Gorenstein projective. In this paper, we are interesting to an extension of this idea. Thus, we discuss the rings over which every Gorenstein projective (resp. flat) module is strongly Gorenstein projective (resp, flat). Our aim is to give examples of rings with different Gorenstein global dimension satisfied this condition.
