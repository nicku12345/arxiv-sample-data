A finite poset P is called "simplicial", if it has the smallest element \hat{0}, and every interval [\hat{0}, x] is a boolean algebra. The face poset of a simplicial complex is a typical example. Generalizing the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex, Stanley assigned the graded ring A_P to P. This ring has been studied from both combinatorial and topological perspective. In this paper, we will give a concise description of a dualizing complex of A_P, which has many applications.
