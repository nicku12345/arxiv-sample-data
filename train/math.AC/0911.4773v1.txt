We present an algorithm which converts a given Sagbi basis of a polynomial K-subalgebra \mathcal{A} to a Sagbi basis of \mathcal{A} in a polynomial ring with respect to another term ordering, under the assumption that subalgebra \mathcal{A} admits a finite Sagbi basis with respect to all term ordering. The Sagbi walk method converts a Sagbi basis by partitioning the computations following a path in the Sagbi Fan. The algorithms have been implemented as a library for the computer algebra system SINGULAR \cite{GPS1}.
