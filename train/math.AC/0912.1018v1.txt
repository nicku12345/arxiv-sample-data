We recall Vere-Jones's definition of the \alpha--permanent and describe the connection between the (1/2)--permanent and the hafnian. We establish expansion formulae for the \alpha--permanent in terms of partitions of the index set, and we use these to prove Lieb-type inequalities for the \pm\alpha--permanent of a positive semi-definite Hermitian n\times n matrix and the \alpha/2--permanent of a positive semi-definite real symmetric n\times n matrix if \alpha is a nonnegative integer or \alpha\ge n-1. We are unable to settle Shirai's nonnegativity conjecture for \alpha--permanents when \alpha\ge 1, but we verify it up to the 5\times 5 case, in addition to recovering and refining some of Shirai's partial results by purely combinatorial proofs.
