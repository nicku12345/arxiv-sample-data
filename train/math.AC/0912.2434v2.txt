We prove that a complete local or graded one-dimensional domain of prime characteristic has finite F-representation type if its residue field is algebraically closed or finite, and present examples of a complete local or graded one-dimensional domain which does not have finite F-representation type with a perfect residue field. We also present some examples of higher dimensional rings of finite F-representation type.
