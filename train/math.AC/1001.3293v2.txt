Roberts, Freudenburg, and Daigle and Freudenburg have given the smallest counterexamples to Hilbert's fourteenth problem as rings of invariants of algebraic groups. Each is of an action of the additive group on a finite dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero, and thus, each is the kernel of a locally nilpotent derivation. In positive characteristic, additive group actions correspond to locally finite iterative higher derivations. We set up characteristic-free analogs of the three examples, and show that, contrary to characteristic zero, in every positive charateristic, the invariants are finitely generated.
