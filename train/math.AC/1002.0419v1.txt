Let A be a local ring which admits an exact pair x,y of zero divisors as defined by Henriques and Sega. Assuming that this pair is regular and that there exists a regular element on the A-module A/(x,y), we explicitly construct an infinite family of non-isomorphic indecomposable totally reflexive A-modules. In this setting, our construction provides an answer to a question raised by Christensen, Piepmeyer, Striuli, and Takahashi. Furthermore, we compute the module of homomorphisms between any two given modules from the infinite family mentioned above.
