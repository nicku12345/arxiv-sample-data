We define a notion of Gorenstein flat dimension for unbounded complexes over left GF-closed rings. Over Gorenstein rings we introduce a notion of Gorenstein cohomology for complexes; we also define a generalized Tate cohomology for complexes over Gorenstein rings, and we show that there is a close connection between the absolute, the Gorenstein and the generalized Tate cohomology.
