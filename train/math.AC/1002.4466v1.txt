We show that if (R, \m) is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring and I is an ideal of minimal mixed multiplicity, then \depth G(I) \geq d- 1 implies that \depth F(I) \geq d-1. We use this to show that if I is a contracted ideal in a two dimensional regular local ring then \depth R[It]-1= \depth G(I) = \depth F(I). We also give an infinite class of ideals where R[It] is Cohen-Macaulay but F(I) is not.
