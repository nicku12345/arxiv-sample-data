In this article, we prove that the Buchsbaum-Rim function \ell_A(\S_{\nu+1}(F)/N^{\nu+1}) of a parameter module N in F is bounded above by e(F/N) \binom{\nu+d+r-1}{d+r-1} for every integer \nu \geq 0. Moreover, it turns out that the base ring A is Cohen-Macaulay once the equality holds for some integer \nu. As a direct consequence, we observe that the first Buchsbaum-Rim coefficient e_1(F/N) of a parameter module N is always non-positive.
