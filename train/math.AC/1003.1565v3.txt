In this paper we study the class of w-Jaffard domains in pullback constructions, and give new examples of these domains. In particular we give examples to show that the two classes of w-Jaffard and Jaffard domains are incomparable. As another application, we establish that for each pair of positive integers (n,m) with n+1\leq m\leq 2n+1, there is an (integrally closed) integral domain R such that w-\dim(R)=n and w[X]-\dim(R[X])=m.
