In this paper, we define weakly coherent rings, and examine the transfer of these rings to homomorphic image, trivial ring extension, localization, and direct product. These results provide examples of weakly coherent rings that are not coherent rings. We show that the class of weakly coherent rings is not stable by localization. Also, we show that the class of weakly coherent rings and the class of strongly 2-coherent rings are not comparable.
