Let I\subset J be monomial ideals of a polynomial algebra S over a field. Then the Stanley depth of J/I is smaller or equal with the Stanley depth of \sqrt{J}/\sqrt{I}. We give also an upper bound for the Stanley depth of the intersection of two primary monomial ideals Q, Q', which is reached if Q, Q' are irreducible, ht(Q+Q') is odd and \sqrt{Q}, \sqrt{Q'} have no common variable.
