Let M be a finitely generated module on a local ring R and \F: M_0\subset M_1\subset...\subset M_t=M a filtration of submodules of M such that  d_o<d_1< ... <d_t=d, where d_i=\dim M_i. This paper is concerned with a non-negative integer p_\mathcal F(M) which is defined as the least degree of all polynomials in n_1, ..., n_d bounding above the function \ell(M/(x_1^{n_1}, ..., x_d^{n_d})M)-\sum_{i=0}^tn_1...n_{d_i}e(x_1,..., x_{d_i};M_i). We prove that p_\mathcal F(M) is independent of the choices of good systems of parameters \underline x=x_1, ..., x_d. When \F is the dimension filtration of M we also present some relations between p_\F(M) and the polynomial type of each M_i/M_{i-1} and the dimension of the non-sequentially Cohen-Macaulay locus of M.
