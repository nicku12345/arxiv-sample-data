Let (R,\m) be a Noetherian local ring and M a finitely generated R-module with \dim M=d. Let i\geq 0 be an integer. Following M. Brodmann and R. Y. Sharp \cite{BS1}, the i-th pseudo support of M is the set of all prime ideals \p of R such that  H^{i-\dim (R/\p)}_{\p R_{\p}}(M_{\p})\neq 0. In this paper, we study the pseudo supports and the non Cohen-Macaulay locus of M in connections with the catenarity of the ring R/\Ann_RM, the Serre conditions on M, and the unmixedness of the local rings R/\p for certain prime ideals \p in \Supp_R (M).
