Let (A,m_A) -> (B,m_B) be a local morphism of local noetherian rings and M a finitely generated B-module. Then it follows from Tor^A_1(M,A/m_A) = 0 that M is a flat A-module. This is usually called the "local criterion of flatness". We give a proof that proceeds along different lines than the usual textbook proofs, using completions and only elementary properties of flat modules and the Tor-functor.
