In this paper, we consider five possible extensions of the Pr\"ufer domain notion to the case of commutative rings with zero-divisors. We investigate the transfer of these Pr\"ufer-like properties between a ring R and R\bowtie I; his amalgamated duplication along some ideal I, and then generate new and original families of rings with these properties.
