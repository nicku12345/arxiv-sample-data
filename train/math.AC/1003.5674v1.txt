For valued fields K of rank higher than 1, we describe how elements in the henselization K^h of K can be approximated from within K; our result is a handy generalization of the well-known fact that in rank 1, all of these elements lie in the completion of K. We apply the result to show that if an element z algebraic over K can be approximated from within K in the same way as an element in K^h, then K(z) is not linearly disjoint from K^h over K.
