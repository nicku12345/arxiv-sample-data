We prove a general version of the "Stability Theorem": if K is a valued field such that the ramification theoretical defect is trivial for all of its finite extensions, and if F|K is a finitely generated (transcendental) extension of valued fields for which equality holds in the Abhyankar inequality, then the defect is also trivial for all finite extensions of F. This theorem is applied to eliminate ramification in such valued function fields. It has applications to local uniformization and to the model theory of valued fields in positive characteristic.
