Let R be a local ring, and let M and N be finitely generated R-modules such that M has finite complete intersection dimension. In this paper we define and study, under certain conditions, a pairing using the modules \Ext_R^i(M,N) which generalizes Buchweitz's notion of the Herbrand diference. We exploit this pairing to examine the number of consecutive vanishing of \Ext_R^i(M,N) needed to ensure that \Ext_R^i(M,N)=0 for all i\gg 0. Our results recover and improve on most of the known bounds in the literature, especially when R has dimension at most two.
