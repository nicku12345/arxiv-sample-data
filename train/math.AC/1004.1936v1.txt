In this work we investigate the derivations of n-dimensional complex evolution algebras, depending on the rank of the appropriate matrices. For evolution algebra with non-singular matrices we prove that the space of derivations is zero. The spaces of derivations for evolution algebras with matrices of rank n-1 are described.
