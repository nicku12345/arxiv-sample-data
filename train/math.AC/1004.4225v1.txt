Let k be a field, let R be a ring of polynomials in a finite number of variables over k, let D be the ring of k-linear differential operators of R and let f be a non-zero element of R. It is well-known that R_f, with its natural D-module structure, has finite length in the category of D-modules. We give a characteristic-free proof of this fact. To the best of our knowledge this is the first characteristic-free proof.
