Let R=\Bbbk[x_1,...,x_m] be the polynomial ring over a field \Bbbk with the standard \mathbb Z^m-grading (multigrading), let L be a Noetherian multigraded R-module, let \beta_{i,\alpha}(L) the ith (multigraded) Betti number of L of multidegree \a. We introduce the notion of a generic (relative to L) multidegree, and the notion of multigraded module of generic type. When the multidegree \a is generic (relative to L) we provide a Hochster-type formula for \beta_{i,\alpha}(L) as the dimension of the reduced homology of a certain simplicial complex associated with L. This allows us to show that there is precisely one homological degree i\ge 1 in which \beta_{i,\alpha}(L) is non-zero and in this homological degree the Betti number is the \beta-invariant of a certain minor of a matroid associated to L. In particular, this provides a precise combinatorial description of all multigraded Betti numbers of L when it is a multigraded module of generic type.
