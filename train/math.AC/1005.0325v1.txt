This article is concerned with graded modules M with linear resolutions over a standard graded algebra R. It is proved that if such an M has Hilbert series H_M(s) of the form ps^d+qs^{d+1}, then the algebra R is Koszul; if, in addition, M has constant Betti numbers, then H_R(s)=1+es+(e-1)s^{2}. When H_R(s)=1+es+rs^{2} with r\leq e-1, and R is Gorenstein or e=r+1\le 3, it is proved that generic R-modules with q\leq(e-1)p are linear.
