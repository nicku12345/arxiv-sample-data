A new construction of rings is introduced, studied, and applied. Given surjective homomorphisms R\to T\gets S of local rings, and ideals in R and S that are isomorphic to some T-module V, the \emph{connected sum} R#_TS is defined to be the local ring obtained by factoring out the diagonal image of V in the fiber product R\times_TS. When T is Cohen-Macaulay of dimension d and V is a canonical module of T, it is proved that if R and S are Gorenstein of dimension d, then so is R#_TS. This result is used to study how closely an artinian ring can be approximated by Gorenstein rings mapping onto it. It is proved that when T is a field the cohomology algebra \Ext^*_{R#_kS}(k,k) is an amalgam of the algebras \Ext^*_{R}(k,k) and \Ext^*_{S}(k,k) over isomorphic polynomial subalgebras generated by one element of degree 2. This is used to show that when T is regular, the ring R#_TS almost never is complete intersection.
