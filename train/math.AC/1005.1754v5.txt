Let R be a Noetherian ring, M an Artinian R-module, \p\in\Cos_RM. Then \cograde_{R_{\p}}\Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M)=\inf\{i | \pi_{i}(\p,M)>0\} and \pi_{i}(\p,M)>0\Rightarrow\cograde_{R_{\p}}\Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M)\leq i\leq\fd_{R_{\p}}\Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M), where \pi_{i}(\p,M) is the i-th dual Bass number of M with respect to \p, the integer \cograde_{R_{\p}}\Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M) is the common length of any maximal \Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M)-quasi co-regular sequence contained in \p R_{\p}, and \fd_{R_{\p}}\Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M) is the flat dimension of R_{\p}-module \Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M) (Theorem \ref{Thm:Main}). Besides, we also study the relations among cograde, co-dimension and flat dimension of co-localization module \Hom_{R}(R_{\p},M).
