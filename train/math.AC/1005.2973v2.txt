We give a polynomial gluing construction of two groups G_X\subseteq GL(\ell,\mathbb F) and G_Y\subseteq GL(m,\mathbb F) which results in a group G\subseteq GL(\ell+m,\mathbb F) whose ring of invariants is isomorphic to the tensor product of the rings of invariants of G_X and G_Y. In particular, this result allows us to obtain many groups with polynomial rings of invariants, including all p-groups whose rings of invariants are polynomial over \mathbb F_p, and the finite subgroups of GL(n,\mathbb F) defined by sparsity patterns, which generalize many known examples.
