We introduce the concept of Stanley decompositions in the localized polynomial ring S_f where f is a product of variables, and we show that the Stanley depth does not decrease upon localization. Furthermore it is shown that for monomial ideals J\subset I\subset S_f the number of Stanley spaces in a Stanley decomposition of I/J is an invariant of I/J. For the proof of this result we introduce Hilbert series for \ZZ^n-graded K-vector spaces.
