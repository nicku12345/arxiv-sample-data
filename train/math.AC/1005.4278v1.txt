The universal Gr\"{o}bner basis of I, is a Gr\"{o}bner basis for I with respect to all term orders simultaneously. Let I_G be the toric ideal of a graph G. We characterize in graph theoretical terms the elements of the universal Gr\"{o}bner basis of the toric ideal I_G.   We provide a bound for the degree of the binomials in the universal Gr\"{o}bner basis of the toric ideal of a graph. Finally we give a family of examples of circuits for which their true degrees are less than the degrees of some elements of the Graver basis.
