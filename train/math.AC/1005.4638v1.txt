Let S={\Bbb K}[x_1,\dots,x_n] denote a polynomial ring over a field \Bbb K. Given a monomial ideal I and a finitely generated multigraded M over S, we follow Herzog's method to construct a multigraded free S-resolution of M/IM by using multigraded S-free resolutions of S/I and M. The complex constructed in this paper is used to prove the inequality \Reg(IM)\leq \Reg(I)+\Reg(M) for a large class of ideals and modules. In the case where M is an ideal, under one relative condition on the generators which specially does not involve the dimensions, the inequality \Reg(IM)\leq \Reg(I)+\Reg(M) is proven.
