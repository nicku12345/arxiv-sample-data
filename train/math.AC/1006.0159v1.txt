Let f:A\lo B be a ring homomorphism and let J be an ideal of B. In this paper, we investigate the transfer of notions elementary divisor ring, Hermite ring and B\'ezout ring to the amalgamation A\bowtie^fJ. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for  A\bowtie^fJ to be an elementary divisor ring where A and B are integral domains. In this case it is shown that  A\bowtie^fJ is an Hermite ring if and only it is a B\'ezout ring. In particular, we study the transfer of the previous notions to the amalgamated duplication of a ring A along an A-submodule E of Q(A) such that E^2\subseteq E.
