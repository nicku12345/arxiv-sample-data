Let A be a regular domain of dimension d containing an infinite field and let n be an integer with 2n\geq d+3. For a stably free A-module P of rank n, we prove that (i) P has a unimodular element if and only if the euler class of P is zero in E^n(A) and (ii) we define Whitney class homomorphism w(P):E^s(A)\ra E^{n+s}(A), where E^s(A) denotes the sth Euler class group of A for s\geq 1.
