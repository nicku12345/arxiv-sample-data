In this article, we prove that in content extentions minimal primes extend to minimal primes and discuss zero-divisors of a content algebra over a ring who has Property (A) or whose set of zero-divisors is a finite union of prime ideals. We also examine the preservation of diameter of zero-divisor graph under content extensions.
