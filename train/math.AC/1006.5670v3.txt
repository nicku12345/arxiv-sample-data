Let K be a field, B a simplicial affine semigroup, and C(B) the corresponding cone. We will present a decomposition of K[B] into a direct sum of certain monomial ideals, which generalizes a construction by Hoa and St\"uckrad. We will use this decomposition to construct a semigroup \tilde B with B \subseteq \tilde B \subseteq C(B) such that K[\tilde B] is Cohen-Macaulay with the property: \tilde B \subseteq \hat B for every affine semigroup \hat B with B \subseteq \hat B \subseteq C(B) such that K[\hat B] is Cohen-Macaulay.
