Let (R,\fm) be a local ring and (-)^{\vee} denote the Matlis duality functor. We investigate the relationship between Foxby equivalence and local duality through generalized local cohomology modules. Assume that R possesses a normalized dualizing complex D and X and Y are two homologically bounded complexes of R-modules with finitely generated homology modules. We present several duality results for \fm-section complex {\bf R}\Gamma_{\fm}({\bf R}\Hom_R(X,Y)). In particular, if G-dimension of X and injective dimension of Y are finite, then we show that {\bf R}\Gamma_{\fm}({\bf R}\Hom_R(X,Y))\simeq ({\bf R}\Hom_R(Y,D\otimes_ R^{{\bf L}}X))^{\vee}. We deduce several applications of these duality results. In particular, we establish Grothendieck's non-vanishing Theorem in the context of generalized local cohomology modules.
