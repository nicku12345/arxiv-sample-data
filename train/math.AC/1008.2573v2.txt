Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring and let M and N be non-zero finitely generated R-modules. We investigate necessary conditions for the depth formula \depth(M)+\depth(N)=\depth(R)+\depth(M\otimes_{R}N) to hold. We show that, under certain conditions, M and N satisfy the depth formula if and only if \Tor_{i}^{R}(M,N) vanishes for all i\geq 1. We also examine the relationship between good depth of M\otimes_RN and the vanishing of \Ext modules, with various applications.
