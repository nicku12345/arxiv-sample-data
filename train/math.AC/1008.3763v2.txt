The main purposes of this paper are to establish and exploit the result that, over a complete (Noetherian) local ring R of prime characteristic for which the Frobenius homomorphism f is finite, the appropriate restrictions of the Matlis-duality functor provide an equivalence between the category of left modules over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring R[x,f] that are Artinian as R-modules and the category of right R[x,f]-modules that are Noetherian as R-modules.
