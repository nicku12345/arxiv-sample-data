Let K be an algebrically closed field and let n\geq 1. If P\in K[X]=K[X_1,\ldots,X_n], P\neq 0, we denote by I(P) the support of P, which is the finite subset of \mathbb N^n such that P=\sum_{i\in I(P)}a_iX^i with a_i\in K^*. (If i=(i_1,\ldots,i_n) then X^i:=X_1^{i_1}\cdots X_n^{i_n}.) We determine all finite, nonempty sets I\sb\mathbb N^n such that every P\in K[X] with I(P)=I is decomposable. We also consider the problem of finding all I\sb\mathbb N^n such that every P\in K[X] with I(P)=I is irreducible. We do not solve this problem, which is very unlikely to have a simple answer. We show however that the answer depends on the characteristic of K and we determine the nature of this dependence.
