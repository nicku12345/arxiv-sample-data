Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and M a finitely generated R-module. We show in this paper that, for an integer t, if the local cohomology module H^{i}_\mathfrak{a}(M) with respect to an ideal \frak a is finitely generated for all i<t, then H^{i}_\mathfrak{a}(M/xM)\cong H^{i}_\mathfrak{a}(M)\oplus H^{i+1}_\mathfrak{a}(M) for all \frak a-filter regular elements x containing in a enough large power of \frak a and all i<t-1. As consequences we obtain generalizations, by very short proofs, of the main results of M. Brodmann and A.L. Faghani (A finiteness result for associated primes of local cohomology modules, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 128(2000), 2851-2853) and of H.L. Truong and the first author (Asymptotic behavior of parameter ideals in generalized Cohen-Macaulay module, J. Algebra, 320(2008),158-168).
