Asymptotic properties of saturated powers of modules over a local domain R are studied. Under mild conditions, it is shown that the limit as k goes to infinity of the quotient of the saturation of the k-th power of a module E by the k-th power of E, when divided by k^{d+e-1}, exists. Here d is the dimension of R and e is the rank of E. We deduce that under these assumptions, the epsilon multiplicity of E, defined by Ulrich and Validashti as a limsup, actually exists as a limit.
