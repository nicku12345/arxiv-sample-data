We consider the valued field \mathds{K}:=\mathbb{R}((\Gamma)) of formal series (with real coefficients and monomials in a totally ordered multiplicative group \Gamma>). We investigate how to endow \mathds{K} with a logarithm l, which satisfies some natural properties such as commuting with infinite products of monomials. In the article "Hardy type derivations on generalized series fields", we study derivations on \mathds{K}. Here, we investigate compatibility conditions between the logarithm and the derivation, i.e. when the logarithmic derivative is the derivative of the logarithm. We analyse sufficient conditions on a given derivation to construct a compatible logarithm via integration of logarithmic derivatives. In her monograph "Ordered exponential fields", the first author described the exponential closure \mathds{K}^{\rm{EL}} of (\mathds{K},l). Here we show how to extend such a log-compatible derivation on \mathds{K} to \mathds{K}^{\rm{EL}}.
