We generalize a Brian\c{c}on-Skoda type theorem first studied by Aberbach and Huneke. With some conditions on a regular local ring (R,\m) containing a field, and an ideal I of R with analytic spread \ell and a minimal reduction J, we prove that for all w \geq -1,  \bar{I^{\ell+w}} \subseteq J^{w+1} \mathfrak{a} (I,J), where \mathfrak{a}(I,J) is the coefficient ideal of I relative to J, i.e. the largest ideal \mathfrak{b} such that I\mathfrak{b}=J\mathfrak{b}. Previously, this result was known only for \m-primary ideals.
