The Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem in its many versions has been studied by algebraists for several decades. In this paper, under some assumptions on an F-rational local ring (R,\m), and an ideal I of R of analytic spread \ell and height g < \ell, we improve on two theorems by Aberbach and Huneke. Let J be a reduction of I. We first give results on when the integral closure of I^\ell is contained in the product J I_{\ell-1}, where I_{\ell-1} is the intersection of the primary components of I of height \leq \ell-1. In the case that R is also Gorenstein, we give results on when the integral closure of I^{\ell-1} is contained in J.
