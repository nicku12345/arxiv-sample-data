Let R be a commutative local noetherian ring, and let L and L' be R-modules. We investigate the properties of the functors Tor_i^R(L,-) and Ext^i_R(L,-). For instance, we show the following:   (a) if L is artinian and L' is noetherian, then Hom_R(L,L') has finite length;   (b) if L and L' are artinian, then the tensor product L \otimes_R L' has finite length;   (c) if L and L' are artinian, then Tor_i^R(L,L') is artinian, and Ext^i_R(L,L') is noetherian over the completion \hat R; and   (d) if L is artinian and L' is Matlis reflexive, then Ext^i_R(L,L'), Ext^i_R(L',L), and Tor_i^R(L,L') are Matlis reflexive.   Also, we study the vanishing behavior of these functors, and we include computations demonstrating the sharpness of our results.
