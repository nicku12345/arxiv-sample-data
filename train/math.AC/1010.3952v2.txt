Lance Bryant noticed in his thesis that there was a flaw in our paper "Associated graded rings of one-dimensional analytically irreducible rings", J. Algebra 304 (2006), 349-358. It can be fixed by adding a condition, called the BF condition. We discuss some equivalent conditions, and show that they are fulfilled for some classes of rings, in particular for our motivating example of semigroup rings. Furthermore we discuss the connection to a similar result, stated in more generality, by Cortadella-Zarzuela. Finally we use our result to conclude when a semigroup ring in embedding dimension at most three has an associated graded which is a complete intersection.
