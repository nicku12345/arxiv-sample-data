We give different bounds for the Stanley depth of a monomial ideal I of a polynomial algebra S over a field K. For example we show that the Stanley depth of I is less or equal with the Stanley depth of any prime ideal associated to S/I. Also we show that the Stanley conjecture holds for I and S/I when the associated prime ideals of S/I are generated by disjoint sets of variables.
