We review the definition of D-rings introduced by H. Gunji & D. L. MacQuillan. We provide an alternative characterization for such rings that allows us to give an elementary proof of that a ring of algebraic integers is a D-ring. Moreover, we give a characterization for D-rings that are also unique factorization domains to determine divisibility of polynomials using polynomial evaluations.
