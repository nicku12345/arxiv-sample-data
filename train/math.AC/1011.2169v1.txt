We explicitly construct a finite set of separating invariants for the basic \Ga-actions. These are the finite dimensional indecomposable rational linear representations of the additive group \Ga of a field of characteristic zero, and their invariants are the kernel of the Weitzenb\"ock derivation D_{n}=x_{0}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x_{1}}}+...+ x_{n-1}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x_{n}}}.
