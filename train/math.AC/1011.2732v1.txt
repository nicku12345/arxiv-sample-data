We prove that the Hilbert functions of codimension four graded Gorenstein Artin algebras R/I are unimodal provided I has a minimal generator in degree less than five. It is an open question whether all Gorenstein h-vectors in codimension four are unimodal. In this paper, we prove that Hilbert functions of all artinian codimension four Gorenstein algebras starting with (1,4,10, 20, h_4,...), where h_4\leq 34 are unimodal. Combining this with the previously known results, we obtain that all Gorenstein h-vectors (1, h_1, h_2,h_3, h_4, ....) are unimodal if h_4\leq 3.
