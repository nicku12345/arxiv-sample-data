For a monomial ideal I of a polynomial ring S, a "polarization" of I is a \textit{squarefree} monomial ideal J of a larger polynomial ring S' such that S/I is a quotient of S'/J by a regular sequence (consisting of degree 1 elements). We show that a Borel fixed ideal admits a "non-standard" polarization. For example, while the standard polarization sends xy^2 \in S to x_1y_1y_2 \in S', ours sends it to x_1y_2y_3. Using this idea, we recover/refine the results on "squarefree operation" in the shifting theory of simplicial complexes. The present paper generalizes a result of Nagel and Reiner, while our approach is very different from theirs.
