Let R be a noetherian commutative ring, and \[ \mathbb F: ...\rightarrow F_2\rightarrow F_1\rightarrow F_0\rightarrow 0 \] a complex of flat R-modules. We prove that if \kappa(\mathfrak p)\otimes_R\mathbb F is acyclic for every \mathfrak p\in\Spec R, then \mathbb F is acyclic, and H_0(\mathbb F) is R-flat. It follows that if \mathbb F is a (possibly unbounded) complex of flat R-modules and \kappa(\mathfrak p)\otimes_R \mathbb F is exact for every \mathfrak p\in\Spec R, then \mathbb G\otimes_R^\bullet\mathbb F is exact for every R-complex \mathbb G. If, moreover, \mathbb F is a complex of projective R-modules, then it is null-homotopic (follows from Neeman's theorem).
