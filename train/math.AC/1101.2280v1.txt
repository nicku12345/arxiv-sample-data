Let R be a standard graded Noetherian algebra over an Artinian local ring. Motivated by the work of Achilles and Manaresi in intersection theory, we first express the multiplicity of R by means of local j-multiplicities of various hyperplane sections. When applied to a homogeneous inclusion A\subseteq B of standard graded Noetherian algebras over an Artinian local ring, this formula yields the multiplicity of A in terms of that of B and of local j-multiplicities of hyperplane sections along {\rm Proj}\,(B). Our formulas can be used to find the multiplicity of special fiber rings and to obtain the degree of dual varieties for any hypersurface. In particular, it gives a generalization of Teissier's Pl\"{u}cker formula to hypersurfaces with non-isolated singularities. Our work generalizes results by Simis, Ulrich and Vasconcelos on homogeneous embeddings of graded algebras.
