Let R be a Noetherian local ring. We define the minimal j-multiplicity and almost minimal j-multiplicity of an arbitrary R-ideal on any finite R-module. For any ideal I with minimal j-multiplicity or almost minimal j-multiplicity on a Cohen-Macaulay module M, we prove that under some residual assumptions, the associated graded module {\rm gr}_I(M) is Cohen-Macaulay or almost Cohen-Macaulay, respectively. Our work generalizes the results for minimal multiplicity and almost minimal multiplicity obtained by Sally, Rossi, Valla, Wang, Huckaba, Elias, Corso, Polini, and VazPinto.
