We define a family of homogeneous ideals with large projective dimension and regularity relative to the number of generators and their common degree. This family subsumes and improves upon constructions given in [Cav04] and [McC]. In particular, we describe a family of three-generated homogeneous ideals in arbitrary characteristic whose projective dimension grows asymptotically as sqrt{d}^(sqrt(d) - 1).
