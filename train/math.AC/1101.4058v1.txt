Let G be a finite graph on the vertex set [d] = \{1, ..., d \} with the edges e_1, ..., e_n and K[\tb] = K[t_1, ..., t_d] the polynomial ring in d variables over a field K. The edge ring of G is the semigroup ring K[G] which is generated by those monomials \tb^e = t_it_j such that e = \{i, j\} is an edge of G. Let K[\xb] = K[x_1, ..., x_n] be the polynomial ring in n variables over K and define the surjective homomorphism \pi : K[\xb] \to K[G] by setting \pi(x_i) = \tb^{e_i} for i = 1, ..., n. The toric ideal I_G of G is the kernel of \pi. It will be proved that, given integers f and d with 6 \leq f \leq d, there exist a finite connected nonbipartite graph G on [d] together with a reverse lexicographic order <_{\rev} on K[\xb] and a lexicographic order <_{\lex} on K[\xb] such that (i) K[G] is normal, (ii) \depth K[\xb]/\ini_{<_{\rev}}(I_G) = f and (iii) K[\xb]/\ini_{<_{\lex}}(I_G) is Cohen--Macaulay, where \ini_{<_{\rev}}(I_G) (resp.\ \ini_{<_{\lex}}(I_G)) is the initial ideal of I_G with respect to <_{\rev} (resp.\ <_{\lex}) and where \depth K[\xb]/\ini_{<_{\rev}}(I_G) is the depth of K[\xb]/\ini_{<_{\rev}}(I_G).
