We present a complete characterization of subdirectly irreducible MV-algebras with internal states (SMV-algebras). This allows us to classify subdirectly irreducible state morphism MV-algebras (SMMV-algebras) and describe single generators of the variety of SMMV-algebras, and show that we have a continuum of varieties of SMMV-algebras.
