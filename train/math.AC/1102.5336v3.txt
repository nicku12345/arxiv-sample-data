Let R=k[x_1,..., x_n] be a polynomial ring over a field k of characteristic p>0, let \m=(x_1,..., x_n) be the maximal ideal generated by the variables, let ^*E be the naturally graded injective hull of R/\m and let ^*E(n) be ^*E degree shifted downward by n. We introduce the notion of graded F-modules (as a refinement of the notion of F-modules) and show that if a graded F-module \M has zero-dimensional support, then \M, as a graded R-module, is isomorphic to a direct sum of a (possibly infinite) number of copies of ^*E(n).   As a consequence, we show that if the functors T_1,...,T_s and T are defined by T_{j}=H^{i_j}_{I_j}(-) and T=T_1\circ...\circ T_s, where I_1,..., I_s are homogeneous ideals of R, then as a naturally graded R-module, the local cohomology module H^{i_0}_{\m}(T(R)) is isomorphic to ^*E(n)^c, where c is a finite number. If \text{char}k=0, this question is open even for s=1.
