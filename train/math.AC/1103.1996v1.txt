We compute the minimal primary decomposition for completely squarefree lexsegment ideals. We show that critical squarefree monomial ideals are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. As an application, we give a complete characterization of the completely squarefree lexsegment ideals which are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay and we also derive formulas for some homological invariants of this class of ideals.
