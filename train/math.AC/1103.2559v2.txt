We show that every quasi-ordinary Weierstrass polynomial P(Z) = Z^d+a_1 (X) Z^{d-1}+...+a_d(X) \in \K[[X]][Z] , X=(X_1,..., X_n), over an algebraically closed field of characterisic zero \K, and satisfying a_1=0, is \nu-quasi-ordinary. That means that if the discriminant \Delta_P \in \K[[X]] is equal to a monomial times a unit then the ideal (a_i^{d!/i}(X))_{i=2,...,d} is principal and generated by a monomial. We use this result to give a constructive proof of the Abhyankar-Jung Theorem that works for any Henselian local subring of \K[[X]] and the function germs of quasi-analytic families.
