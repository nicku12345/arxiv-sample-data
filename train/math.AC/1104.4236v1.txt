For a commutative ring R, the F-signature was defined by Huneke and Leuschke \cite{H-L}. It is an invariant that measures the order of the rank of the free direct summand of R^{(e)}. Here, R^{(e)} is R itself, regarded as an R-module through e-times Frobenius action F^e.In this paper, we show a connection of the F-signature of a graded ring with other invariants. More precisely, for a graded F-finite Gorenstein ring R of dimension d, we give an inequality among the F-signature s(R), a-invariant a(R) and Poincar\'{e} polynomial P(R,t). \[ s(R)\le\frac{(-a(R))^d}{2^{d-1}d!}\lim_{t\rightarrow 1}(1-t)^dP(R,t) \]Moreover, we show that R^{(e)} has only one free direct summand for any e, if and only if R is F-pure and a(R)=0. This gives a characterization of such rings.
