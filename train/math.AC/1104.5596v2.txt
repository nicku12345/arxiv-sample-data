Let I be a monomial squarefree ideal of a polynomial ring S over a field K such that the sum of every three different of its minimal prime ideals is the maximal ideal of S, or more general a constant ideal. We associate to I a graph on [s], s=|\Min S/I| on which we may {\em read} the depth of I. In particular,   \depth_S\ I does not depend of char K. Also we show that I satisfies the Stanley's Conjecture.
