Let R be a commutative ring with nonzero identity and M be an R-module. Quasi-prime submodules of M and the developed Zariski topology on q\Spec(M) are introduced. We also, investigate the relationship between the algebraic properties of M and the topological properties of q\Spec(M). Modules whose developed Zariski topology is respectively T_0, irreducible or Noetherian are studied, and several characterizations of such modules are given.
