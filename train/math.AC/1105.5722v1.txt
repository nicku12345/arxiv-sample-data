In this note we compare the a-invariant of a homogeneous algebra B to the a-invariant of a subalgebra A. In particular we show that if A \subset B is a finite homogeneous inclusion of standard graded domains over an algebraically closed field with A normal and B of minimal multiplicity then A has minimal multiplicity. In some sense these results are algebraic generalizations of Hurwitz type theorems.
