Boij-S\"oderberg theory describes the Betti diagrams of graded modules over the polynomial ring up to multiplication by a rational number. Analog Eisenbud-Schreyer theory also describes the cohomology tables of vector bundles on projective spaces up to rational multiple. We give an introduction and survey of these newly developed areas.
