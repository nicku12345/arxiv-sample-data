Let F: C^n \rightarrow C^m be a polynomial map with degF=d \geq 2. We prove that F is invertible if m = n and \sum^{d-1}_{i=1} JF(\alpha_i) is invertible for all i, which is trivially the case for invertible quadratic maps. More generally, we prove that for affine lines L = \{\beta + \mu \gamma | \mu \in C\} \subseteq C^n (\gamma \ne 0), F|_L is linearly rectifiable, if and only if \sum^{d-1}_{i=1} JF(\alpha_i) \cdot \gamma \ne 0 for all \alpha_i \in L. This appears to be the case for all affine lines L when F is injective and d \le 3. We also prove that if m = n and \sum^{n}_{i=1} JF(\alpha_i) is invertible for all \alpha_i \in C^n, then F is a composition of an invertible linear map and an invertible polynomial map X+H with linear part X, such that the subspace generated by \{JH(\alpha) | \alpha \in C^n\} consists of nilpotent matrices.
