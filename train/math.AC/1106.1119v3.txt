This article is a survey of closure operations on ideals in commutative rings, with an emphasis on structural properties and on using tools from one part of the field to analyze structures in another part. The survey is broad enough to encompass the radical, tight closure, integral closure, basically full closure, saturation with respect to a fixed ideal, and the v-operation, among others.
