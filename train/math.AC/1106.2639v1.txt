We use a result of Hellus about generalized local duality to describe some generalized Matlis duals for certain quasi-\F-modules. Furthermore, we apply this description to obtain examples for non-artinian local cohomology modules by the theory of \F-modules. In particular, we get a new view on Hartshorne's counterexample for a conjecture by Grothendieck about the finiteness of Hom_R(R/I,H^i_I(R)) for a noetherian local Ring R and an ideal I \subseteq R.
