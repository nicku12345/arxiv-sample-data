The following is shown : Let S=\{a_1,a_2,..,a_{2n}\} be a subset of a totally ordered commutative semi-group (G,*,\leq) with a_1\leq a_2\leq...\leq a_{2n}. Provided that a system of n a_{i_k} * a_{j_k}\ (a_{i_k}, a_{j_k} \in G ;\ 1 \leq k \leq n), where all 2n elements in S must be used, are less than an element N\ (\in G), then a_1*a_{2n}, a_2*a_{2n-1},..., a_n*a_{n+1} are all less than N. This may be called the Upper Bounding Case. Moreover in the same way, we shall treat also the Lower Bounding Case.
