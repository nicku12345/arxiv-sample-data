Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. In this paper, we study those finitely generated R-modules whose Cousin complexes provide Gorenstein injective resolutions. We call such a module a G-Gorenstein module. Characterizations of G-Gorenstein modules are given and a class of such modules is determined. It is shown that the class of G-Gorenstein modules strictly contains the class of Gorenstein modules. Also, we provide a Gorenstein injective resolution for a balanced big Cohen-Macaulay R-module. Finally, using the notion of a G-Gorenstein module, we obtain characterizations of Gorenstein and regular local rings.
