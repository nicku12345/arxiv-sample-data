We present some variants of the Kaplansky condition for a K-Hermite ring R to be an elementary divisor ring; for example, a commutative K-Hermite ring R is an EDR iff for any elements x,y,z\in R such that (x,y)=(1), there exists an element \lambda\in R such that x+\lambda y=uv, where (u,z)=(v,1-z)=(1).   We present an example of a a B\'ezout domain that is an elementary divisor ring, but it does not have almost stable range 1, thus answering a question of Warren Wm. McGovern.
