In this paper, we continue the study of which h-vectors \H=(1,3,..., h_{d-1}, h_d, h_{d+1}) can be the Hilbert function of a level algebra by investigating Artinian level algebras of codimension 3 with the condition \beta_{2,d+2}(I^{\rm lex})=\beta_{1,d+1}(I^{\rm lex}), where I^{\rm lex} is the lex-segment ideal associated with an ideal I. Our approach is to adopt an homological method called {\it Cancellation Principle}: the minimal free resolution of I is obtained from that of I^{\rm lex} by canceling some adjacent terms of the same shift.   We prove that when \beta_{1,d+2}(I^{\rm lex})=\beta_{2,d+2}(I^{\rm lex}), R/I can be an Artinian level k-algebra only if either h_{d-1}<h_d<h_{d+1} or h_{d-1}=h_d=h_{d+1}=d+1 holds. We also apply our results to show that for \H=(1,3,..., h_{d-1}, h_d, h_{d+1}), the Hilbert function of an Artinian algebra of codimension 3 with the condition h_{d-1}=h_d<h_{d+1},   (a) if h_d\leq 3d+2, then h-vector \H cannot be level, and   (b) if h_d\geq 3d+3, then there is a level algebra with Hilbert function \H for some value of h_{d+1}.
