Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring with non-zero identity and \fa an ideal of R. Let M be a finite R--module of of finite projective dimension and N an arbitrary finite R--module. We characterize the membership of the generalized local cohomology modules \lc^{i}_{\fa}(M,N) in certain Serre subcategories of the category of modules from upper bounds. We define and study the properties of a generalization of cohomological dimension of generalized local cohomology modules. Let \mathcal S be a Serre subcategory of the category of R--modules and n \geqslant \pd M be an integer such that \lc^{i}_{\fa}(M,N) belongs to \mathcal S for all i> n. If \fb is an ideal of R such that \lc^{n}_{\fa}(M,N/{\fb}N) belongs to \mathcal S, It is also shown that the module \lc^{n}_{\fa}(M,N)/{\fb}\lc^{n}_{\fa}(M,N) belongs to \mathcal S.
