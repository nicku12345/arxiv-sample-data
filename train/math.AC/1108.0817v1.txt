In this paper, we consider systems of algebraic and non-linear partial differential equations and inequations. We decompose these systems into so-called simple subsystems and thereby partition the set of solutions. For algebraic systems, simplicity means triangularity, square-freeness and non-vanishing initials. Differential simplicity extends algebraic simplicity with involutivity. We build upon the constructive ideas of J. M. Thomas and develop them into a new algorithm for disjoint decomposition. The given paper is a revised version of a previous paper and includes the proofs of correctness and termination of our decomposition algorithm. In addition, we illustrate the algorithm with further instructive examples and describe its Maple implementation together with an experimental comparison to some other triangular decomposition algorithms.
