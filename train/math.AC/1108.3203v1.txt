Let \mm=(m_0,...,m_n) be an arithmetic sequence, i.e., a sequence of integers m_0<...<m_n with no common factor that minimally generate the numerical semigroup \sum_{i=0}^{n}m_i\N and such that m_i-m_{i-1}=m_{i+1}-m_i for all i\in\{1,...,n-1\}. The homogeneous coordinate ring \Gamma_\mm of the affine monomial curve parametrically defined by X_0=t^{m_0},...,X_n=t^{m_n} is a graded R-module where R is the polynomial ring k[X_0,...,X_n] with the grading obtained by setting \deg{X_i}:=m_i. In this paper, we construct an explicit minimal graded free resolution for \Gamma_\mm and show that its Betti numbers depend only on the value of m_0 modulo n. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Herzog and Srinivasan on the eventual periodicity of the Betti numbers of semigroup rings under translation for the monomial curves defined by an arithmetic sequence.
