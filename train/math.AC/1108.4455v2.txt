In this article, we prove that if R\to S is a homomorphism of Noetherian rings that splits, then for every i\geq 0 and ideal I\subset R, \Ass_R H^i_I(R) is finite when \Ass_S H^i_{IS}(S) is finite. In addition, if S is a Cohen-Macaulay ring that is finitely generated as an R-module, such that all the Bass numbers of H^i_{IS}(S), as an S-module, are finite, then all the Bass numbers of H^i_{I}(R), as an R-module, are finite. Moreover, we show these results for a larger class a functors introduced by Lyubeznik. As a consequence, we exhibit a Gorenstein F-regular UFD of positive characteristic that is not a direct summand, not even a pure subring, of any regular ring.
