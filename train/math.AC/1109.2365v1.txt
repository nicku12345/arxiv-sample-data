The basic sequence of a homogeneous ideal I\sset R=k[\seq{x}{1}{r}] defining an Artinian graded ring A=R/I not having the weak Lefschetz property has the property that the first term of the last part is less than the last term of the penultimate part. For a general linear form \ell in \seq{x}{1}{r}, this fact affects in a certain way the behavior of the r-1 square matrices in k[\ell] which represent the multiplications of the elements of A by \seq{x}{1}{r-1} through a minimal free presentation of A over k[\ell]. Taking advantage of it, we consider some modules over an algebra generated over k[\ell] by the square matrices mentioned above. In this manner, for the case r=3, we prove that an Artinian \Gor\ graded ring A=k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/I has the weak Lefschetz property if \ch{k}=0 and the number of the minimal generators of 0:_A\ell over k[x_1,x_2,x_3] is two.
