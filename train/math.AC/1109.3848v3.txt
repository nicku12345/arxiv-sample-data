Let A and B be commutative rings with identity. An {\it A-B-biring} is an A-algebra S together with a lift of the functor Hom_A(S,-) from A-algebras to sets to a functor from A-algebras to B-algebras. An {\it A-plethory} is a monoid object in the monoidal category, equipped with the composition product, of A-A-birings. The polynomial ring A[X] is an initial object in the category of such structures. The D-algebra Int(D) has such a structure if D = A is a domain such that the natural D-algebra homomorphism \theta_n: {\bigotimes_D}_{i = 1}^n Int(D) \longrightarrow Int(D^n) is an isomorphism for n = 2 and injective for n \leq 4. This holds in particular if \theta_n is an isomorphism for all n, which in turn holds, for example, if D is a Krull domain or more generally a TV PVMD. In these cases we also examine properties of the functor Hom_D(Int(D),-) from D-algebras to D-algebras, which we hope to show is a new object worthy of investigation in the theory of integer-valued polynomials.
