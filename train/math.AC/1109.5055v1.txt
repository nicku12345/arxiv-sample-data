Let (R, \mathfrak m) be a Noetherian local ring. In this work we extend the notion of mixed multiplicities of modules, given in \cite{Kleiman-Thorup2} and \cite{Kirby-Rees1} (see also \cite{Bedregal-Perez}), to an arbitrary family E,E_1,..., E_q of R-submodules of R^p with E of finite colength. We prove that these mixed multiplicities coincide with the Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity of some suitable R-module. In particular, we recover the fundamental Rees's mixed multiplicity theorem for modules, which was proved first by Kirby and Rees in \cite{Kirby-Rees1} and recently also proved by the authors in \cite{Bedregal-Perez}. Our work is based on, and extend to this new context, the results on mixed multiplicities of ideals obtained by Vi\^et in \cite{Viet8} and Manh and Vi\^et in \cite{Manh-Viet}. We also extend to this new setting some of the main results of Trung in \cite{Trung} and Trung and Verma in \cite{Trung-Verma1}. As in \cite{Kleiman-Thorup2}, \cite{Kirby-Rees1} and \cite{Bedregal-Perez}, we actually work in the more general context of standard graded R-algebras.
