If S=<d_1,...,d_\nu> is a numerical semigroup, we call the ring \C[S]=\C[t^{d_1},...,t^{d_\nu}] the semigroup ring of S. We study the ring of differential operators on \C[S], and its associated graded in the filtration induced by the order of the differential operators. We find that these are easy to describe in case S is a so called Arf semigroup. If I is an ideal in \C[S] that is generated by monomials, we also give some results on \der(I,I) (the set of derivations which map I into I).
