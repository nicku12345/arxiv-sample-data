We consider a finite dimensional representation of the dihedral group D_{2p} over a field of characteristic two where p is an odd prime and study the corresponding Hilbert ideal I_H. We show that I_H has a universal Gr\" {o}bner basis consisting of invariants and monomials only. We provide sharp bounds for the degree of an element in this basis and in a minimal generating set for I_H. We also compute the top degree of coinvariants.
