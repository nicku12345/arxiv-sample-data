We give an explicit description of the lattice \Semistar(D) of all semistar operations on any Dedekind domain D from its set \Max(D) of maximal ideals. This descpription is constructive if \Max(D) is finite. As a corollary we show that 2^{{n \choose [n/2]}} \leq |\Semistar(D)| \leq 2^{2^n} if n = |\Max(D)| is finite; we compute |\Semistar(D)| if |\Max(D)| \leq 7; and we show that if \Max(D) is infinite then \Semistar(D) has cardinality 2^{2^{|\Max(D)|}}.
