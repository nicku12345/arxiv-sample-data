Let I be an ideal of a polynomial algebra over a field, generated by r square free monomials of degree d. If r is bigger (or equal, if I is not principal) than the number of square free monomials of I of degree d+1, then \depth_SI= d. Let J\subsetneq I, J\not =0 be generated by square free monomials of degree \geq d+1. If r is bigger than the number of square free monomials of I\setminus J of degree d+1, or more generally the Stanley depth of I/J is d, then \depth_SI/J= d. In particular, Stanley's Conjecture holds in theses cases.
