Let A=\pmb k[x_1,...,x_n]/{(x_1^d,...,x_n^d)}, where \pmb k is an infinite field. If \pmb k has characteristic zero, then Stanley proved that A has the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP). Henceforth, \pmb k has positive characteristic p. If n=3, then Brenner and Kaid have identified all d, as a function of p, for which A has the WLP. In the present paper, the analogous project is carried out for 4\le n. If 4\le n and p=2, then A has the WLP if and only if d=1. If n=4 and p is odd, then we prove that A has the WLP if and only if d=kq+r for integers k,q,d with 1\le k\le \frac{p-1}2, r\in{\frac{q-1}2,\frac{q+1}2}, and q=p^e for some non-negative integer e. If 5\le n, then we prove that A has the WLP if and only if \lfloor\frac{n(d-1)+3}2\rfloor\le p. We first interpret the WLP for the ring {{\pmb k}[x_1, ..., x_{n}]}/{(x_1^d, ..., x_{n}^d)} in terms of the degrees of the non-Koszul relations on the elements x_1^d, ..., x_{n-1}^d, (x_1+ ... +x_{n-1})^d in the polynomial ring \pmb k[x_1, ..., x_{n-1}]. We then exhibit a sufficient condition for {{\pmb k}[x_1, ..., x_{n}]}/{(x_1^d, ..., x_{n}^d)} to have the WLP. This condition is expressed in terms of the non-vanishing in \pmb k of determinants of various Toeplitz matrices of binomial coefficients. Frobenius techniques are used to produce relations of low degree on x_1^d, ..., x_{n-1}^d, {(x_1+ ... +x_{n-1})^d}. From this we obtain a necessary condition for A to have the WLP. We prove that the necessary condition is sufficient by showing that the relevant determinants are non-zero in \pmb k.
