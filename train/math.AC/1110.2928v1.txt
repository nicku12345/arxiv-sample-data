We give a comparison between the Poincare series of two monomial rings: R=A/I and R_q=A/I_q where I_q is a monomial ideal generated by the q'th power of monomial generators of I. We compute the Poincare series for a class of monomial rings with minimal Taylor resolution. The paper was produced during Pragmatic 2011.
