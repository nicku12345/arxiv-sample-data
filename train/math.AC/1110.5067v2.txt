Let G be the cyclic group of order n and suppose {\bf F} is a field containing a primitive n^\text{th} root of unity. We consider the ring of invariants {\bf F}[W]^G of a three dimensional representation W of G where G \subset \text{SL}(W). We describe minimal generators and relations for this ring and prove that the lead terms of the relations are quadratic. These minimal generators for the relations form a Gr\"obner basis with a surprisingly simple combinatorial structure. We describe the graded Betti numbers for a minimal free resolution of F[W]^G. The case where W is any two dimensional representation of G is also handled.
