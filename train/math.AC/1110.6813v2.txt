In this article, we carry out the investigation for regular sequences of symmetric polynomials in the polynomial ring in three and four variable. Any two power sum element in \mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2,...,x_n] for n \geq 3 always form a regular sequence and we state the conjecture when p_a,p_b,p_c for given positive integers a<b<c forms a regular sequence in \mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4]. We also provide evidence for this conjecture by proving it in special instances. We also prove that any sequence of power sums of the form p_{a}, p_{a+1},..., p_{a+ m-1},p_b with m <n-1 forms a regular sequence in \mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]. We also provide partial evidence in support of conjecture's given by Conca, Krattenthaler and Watanabe on regular sequences of symmetric polynomials.
