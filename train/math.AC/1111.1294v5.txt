Let (R, m) be the semigroup ring associated to a numerical semigroup S. In this paper we study the property of its associated graded ring G(m) to be Complete Intersection. In particular, we introduce and characterise beta-rectangular and gamma-rectangular Ap\'ery sets, which will be the fundamental concepts of the paper and will provide, respectively, a sufficient condition and a characterisation for G(m) to be Complete Intersection. Then we use these notions to give four equivalent conditions for G(m) in order to be Complete Intersection.
