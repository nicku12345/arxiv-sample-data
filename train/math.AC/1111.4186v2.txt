We consider the non-positivity of the Hilbert coefficients for a parameter ideal of a commutative Noetherian local ring. In particular, we show that the second Hilbert coefficient of a parameter ideal of depth at least d-1 is always non-positive and give a condition for the coefficient to be zero. With the added condition that the depth of the associated graded ring is also at least d- we show e_{i}(q) \leq 0 for i=1, ..., d.
