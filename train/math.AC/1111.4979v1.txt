Stanley proved that, in characteristic zero, all artinian monomial complete intersections have the strong Lefschetz property. We provide a positive characteristic complement to Stanley's result in the case of artinian monomial complete intersections generated by monomials all of the same degree, and also for arbitrary artinian monomial complete intersections in characteristic two.   To establish these results, we first prove an a priori lower bound on the characteristics that guarantee the Lefschetz properties. We then use a variety of techniques to complete the classifications.
