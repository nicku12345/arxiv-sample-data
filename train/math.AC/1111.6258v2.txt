We construct an Eliahou-Kervaire-like minimal free resolution of the alternative polarization b-pol(I) of a Borel fixed ideal I. It yields new descriptions of the minimal free resolutions of I itself and I^sq, where (-)^sq is the squarefree operation in the shifting theory. These resolutions are cellular, and the (common) supporting cell complex is given by discrete Morse theory. If I is generated in one degree, our description is equivalent to that of Nagel and Reiner.
