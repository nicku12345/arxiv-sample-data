Given a finite module M over a Noetherian local ring (R, \m), we introduce the concept of j-stretched ideals on M. Thanks to a crucial specialization lemma, we show that this notion greatly generalizes (to arbitrary ideals, and with respect to modules) the classical definition of stretched \m-primary ideals of Sally and Rossi-Valla, as well as the notion of minimal and almost minimal j-multiplicity given recently by Polini-Xie. For j-stretched ideals I on a Cohen-Macaulay module M, we show that {\rm gr}_I(M) is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if two classical invariants of I, the reduction number and the index of nilpotency, are equal. Moreover, for the same class of ideals, we provide a generalized version of Sally's conjecture (proving the almost Cohen-Macaulayness of associated graded rings). Our work unifies the approaches of Rossi-Valla and Polini-Xie and generalizes simultaneously results on the (almost) Cohen-Macaulayness %and almost Cohen-Macaulayness of associated graded modules by several authors, including Sally, Rossi-Valla, Wang, Elias, Rossi, Corso-Polini-Vaz Pinto, Huckaba and Polini-Xie.
