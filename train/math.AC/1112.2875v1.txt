In this paper we expand on some results exposed in a previous one, in which we introduced the concept of inessential and strongly inessential generators in a standard basis of a saturated homogeneous ideal. The appearance of strongly inessential elements seemed to be a non generic situation; in this paper we analyze their presence in a perfect height 2 ideal with the greatest number of generators, according to Dubreil's inequality.
