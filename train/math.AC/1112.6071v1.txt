Let (a,a+d,a+2d) be an arithmetic progression of positive integers. The following statements are proved:   (1) If a\mid 2d, then (a, a+d, a+2d)\in\mdeg(\Tame(\mathbb{C}^3)).   (2) If a\nmid 2d, then, except for arithmetic progressions of the form (4i,4i+ij,4i+2ij) with i,j \in\mathbb{N} and j is an odd number, (a, a+d, a+2d)\notin\mdeg(\Tame(\mathbb{C}^3)). We also related the exceptional unknown case to a conjecture of Jie-tai Yu, which concerns with the lower bound of the degree of the Poisson bracket of two polynomials.
