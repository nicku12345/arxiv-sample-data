In this paper we study S-idempotents of the group ring \mathbb{Z}_2G where G is a finite cyclic group of order n. We give a condition on n such that every nonzero idempotent element of the group ring \mathbb{Z}_2G is Smarandache idempotent and we find Smarandache idempotents of the group ring KG, where K is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and G is a finite cyclic group.
