Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, \fa an ideal of R and \mathcal{D}(R) denote the derived category of R-modules. We investigate the theory of local homology in conjunction with Gorenstein flat modules. Let X be a homologically bounded to the right complex and Q a bounded to the right complex of Gorenstein flat R-modules such that Q and X are isomorphic in \mathcal{D}(R). We establish a natural isomorphism {\bf L}\Lambda^{\fa}(X)\simeq \Lambda^{\fa}(Q) in \mathcal{D}(R) which immediately asserts that \sup {\bf L}\Lambda^{\fa}(X)\leq \Gfd_RX. This isomorphism yields several consequences. For instance, in the case R possesses a dualizing complex, we show that \Gfd_R {\bf L}\Lambda^{\fa}(X)\leq \Gfd_RX. Also, we establish a criterion for regularity of Gorenstein local rings.
