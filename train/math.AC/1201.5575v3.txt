We prove upper and lower bounds for all the coefficients in the Hilbert Polynomial of a graded Gorenstein algebra S=R/I with a quasi-pure resolution over R. The bounds are in terms of the minimal and the maximal shifts in the resolution of R . These bounds are analogous to the bounds for the multiplicity found in \cite{S} and are stronger than the bounds for the Cohen Macaulay algebras found in \cite{HZ}.
