To every Gorenstein algebra A of finite vector space dimension greater than 1 over a field \FF of characteristic zero, and a linear projection \pi on its maximal ideal {\mathfrak m} with range equal to the annihilator \Ann({\mathfrak m}) of {\mathfrak m}, one can associate a certain algebraic hypersurface S_{\pi}\subset{\mathfrak m}, which is the graph of a polynomial map P_{\pi}:\ker\pi\ra\Ann({\mathfrak m})\simeq\FF. Recently, in {\rm\cite{FIKK}}, {\rm\cite{FK}} the following surprising criterion was obtained: two Gorenstein algebras A, \tilde A are isomorphic if and only if any two hypersurfaces S_{\pi} and S_{\tilde\pi} arising from A and \tilde A, respectively, are affinely equivalent. The proof is indirect and relies on a CR-geometric argument. In the present paper we give a short algebraic proof of this statement. We also compare the polynomials P_{\pi} with Macaulay's inverse systems. Namely, we show that the restrictions of P_{\pi} to certain subspaces of \ker\pi are inverse systems for A.
