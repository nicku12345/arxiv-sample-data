In this paper we describe a combination of ideas to improve incremental signature-based Groebner basis algorithms having a big impact on their performance. Besides explaining how to combine already known optimizations to achieve more efficient algorithms, we compare the quite different effects on the two best-known algorithms in this area, F5 and G2V, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view.
