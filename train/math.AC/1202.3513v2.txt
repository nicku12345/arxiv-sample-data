Given a finitely generated module M over a local ring A of characteristic p with \pd M < \infty, we study the asymptotic intersection multiplicity \chi_\infty(M, A/\underline{x}), where \underline{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_r) is a system of parameters for M. We show that there exists a system of parameters such that \chi_\infty is positive if and only if \dim \Ext^{d-r}(M, A) = r, where d = \dim A and r = \dim M. We use this to prove several results relating to the Grade Conjecture, which states that \grade M + \dim M = \dim A for any module M with \pd M < \infty.
