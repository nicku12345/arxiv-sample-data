Let M be a finite module and let I be an arbitrary ideal over a Noetherian local ring. We define the generalized Hilbert function of I on M using the 0th local cohomology functor. We show that our definition re-conciliates with that of Ciuperc\breve{{\rm a}}. By generalizing Singh's formula (which holds in the case of \lambda(M/IM)<\infty), we prove that the generalized Hilbert coefficients j_0,..., j_{d-2} are preserved under a general hyperplane section, where d={\rm dim}\,M. We also keep track of the behavior of j_{d-1}. Then we apply these results to study the generalized Hilbert function for ideals that have minimal j-multiplicity or almost minimal j-multiplicity. We provide counterexamples to show that the generalized Hilbert series of ideals having minimal or almost minimal j-multiplicity does not have the `expected' shape described in the case where \lambda(M/IM)<\infty. Finally we give a sufficient condition such that the generalized Hilbert series has the desired shape.
