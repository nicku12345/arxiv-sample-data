Let R be a commutative ring and M an R-module. Let Spec^s(M) be the the collection of all second submodules of M. In this article, we consider a new topology on Spec^s(M), called the second classical Zariski topology, and investigate the interplay between the module theoretic properties of M and the topological properties of Spec^s(M). Moreover, we study Spec^s(M) from point of view of spectral space.
