We propose a new method for constructing small-bias spaces through a combination of Hermitian codes. For a class of parameters our multisets are much faster to construct than what can be achieved by use of the traditional algebraic geometric code construction. So, if speed is important, our construction is competitive with all other known constructions in that region. And if speed is not a matter of interest the small-bias spaces of the present paper still perform better than the ones related to norm-trace codes reported in [12].
