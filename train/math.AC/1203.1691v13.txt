We have proved the following Problem: Let R be a \mathbb{C}-affine domain, let T be an element in R \setminus \mathbb{C} and let i : \mathbb{C}[T] \hookrightarrow R be the inclusion. Assume that R/TR \cong_{\mathbb{C}} \mathbb{C}^{[n-1]} and that R_T \cong_{\mathbb{C}[T]} \mathbb{C}[T]_T^{[n-1]}. Then R \cong_{\mathbb{C}} \mathbb{C}^{[n]}.} This result leads to the negative solution of the candidate counter-example of V.Arno den Essen : Conjecture E : Let A:=\mathbb{C}[t,u,x,y,z] denote a polynomial ring, and let f(u), g(u) and h(u) be the polynomials defined above. Let D:= f'(u)\partial_x + g'(u)\partial_y + h'(u)\partial_z + t\partial_u (which is easily seen to be a locally nilpotent derivation on A). Then A^D \not\cong_{\mathbb{C}} \mathbb{C}^{[4]}.} Consequently it gurantees that the conjectures : the Cancellation Problem for affine spaces", "the Linearization Problem" and "the Embedding Problem" and "the affine \mathbb{A}^n-Fibration Problem" are still open.
