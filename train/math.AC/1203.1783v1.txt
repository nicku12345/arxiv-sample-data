We study the module of Koszul cycles Z_t(I,M) of a homogeneous ideal I in a polynomial ring S with respect to a graded module M. Under mild assumptions on the base field we prove that the regularity of Z_t(I,S) is a subadditive function of the homological position t when I is 0-dimensional. For Borel-fixed ideals I and J we prove that the regularity of Z_t(I,S/J) is bounded above by t(1+\reg I)+\reg S/J.
