A new set of elementary symplectic elements is described, It is shown that these also generate the elementary symplectic group {\rm ESp}_{2n}(R). These generators are more symmetrical than the usual ones, and are useful to study the action of the elementary symplectic group on unimodular rows. Also, an alternate proof of, {\rm ESp}_{2n}(R) is a normal subgroup of {\rm Sp}_{2n}(R), is shown using the Local Global Principle of D. Quillen for the new set of generators.
