The original F5 algorithm introduced by Faug\`ere is formulated for any homogeneous polynomial set input. The correctness of output is shown for any input that terminates the algorithm, but the termination itself is proved only for the case of input being regular polynomial sequence. This article shows that algorithm correctly terminates for any homogeneous input without any reference to regularity. The scheme contains two steps: first it is shown that if the algorithm does not terminate it eventually generates two polynomials where first is a reductor for the second. But first step does not show that this reduction is permitted by criteria introduced in F5. The second step shows that if such pair exists then there exists another pair for which the reduction is permitted by all criteria. Existence of such pair leads to contradiction.
