For a Noetherian local ring (\RR, \m), the first two Hilbert coefficients, e_0 and e_1, of the I-adic filtration of an \m-primary ideal I are known to code for properties of \RR, of the blowup of \spec(\RR) along V(I), and even of their normalizations. We give estimations for these coefficients when I is enlarged (in the case of e_1 in the same integral closure class) for general Noetherian local rings.
