Let 3\leq d_1\leq d_2\leq d_3 be integers. We show the following results: (1) If d_2 is a prime number and \frac{d_1}{\gcd(d_1,d_3)}\neq2, then (d_1,d_2,d_3) is a multidegree of a tame automorphism if and only if d_1=d_2 or d_3\in d_1\mathbb{N}+d_2\mathbb{N}; (2) If d_3 is a prime number and \gcd(d_1,d_2)=1, then (d_1,d_2,d_3) is a multidegree of a tame automorphism if and only if d_3\in d_1\mathbb{N}+d_2\mathbb{N}. We also relate this investigation with a conjecture of Drensky and Yu, which concerns with the lower bound of the degree of the Poisson bracket of two polynomials, and we give a counter-example to this conjecture.
