In this paper, we show that for an F-pure local ring (R,\m), all local cohomology modules H_{\m}^i(R) have finitely many Frobenius compatible submodules. This answers positively an open question raised by F.Enescu and M.Hochster. We also prove that if (R,\m) is excellent and is F-pure on the punctured spectrum, then all local cohomology modules have finite length in the category of R-modules with Frobenius action. Finally, we show that the property that all H_{\m}^(R) have finitely many Frobenius compatible submodules passes to localizations.
