Let (R, m) be a local ring of prime characteristic p and q a varying power of p. We study the asymptotic behavior of the socle of R/I^{[q]} where I is an m -primary ideal of R. In the graded case, we define the notion of diagonal F-threshold of R as the limit of the top socle degree of R/m^{[q]} over q when q \to \infty. Diagonal F-threshold exists as a positive number (rational number in the latter case) when: (1) R is either a complete intersection or R is F-pure on the punctured spectrum; (2) R is a two dimensional normal domain. In the latter case, we also discuss its geometric interpretation and apply it to determine the strong semistability of the syzygy bundle of (x^d, y^d,z^d) over the smooth projective curve in \mathbb P^2 defined by x^n+y^n+z^n=0. The rest of this paper concerns a different question about how the length of the socle of R/I^{[q]} vary as q varies. We give explicit calculations of the length of the socle of R/m^{[q]} for a class of hypersurface rings which attain the minimal Hilbert-Kunz function. We finally show, under mild conditions, the growth of such length function and the growth of the second Betti numbers of R/m^{[q]} differ by at most a constant, as q \to \infty.
