Let (R,\fm) be a commutative Noetherian local ring and let M be an R-module which is a relative Cohen-Macaulay with respect to a proper ideal \fa of R and set n:=\h_{M}\fa. We prove that \ind M<\infty if and only if \ind\H^{n}_\fa(M)<\infty and that \ind\H^{n}_\fa(M)=\ind M-n. We also prove that if R has a dualizing complex and \Gid_{R} M<\infty, then \Gid_{R}\H^{n}_\fa(M)<\infty and \Gid_{R}\H^{n}_\fa(M)=\Gid_{R} M-n. Moreover if R and M are Cohen-Macaulay, then it is proved that \Gid_{R} M<\infty whenever \Gid_{R}\H^{n}_\fa(M)<\infty. Next, for a finitely generated R-module M of dimension d, it is proved that if K_{\hat M} is Cohen-Macaulay and \Gid_{R}\H_{\fm}^{d}(M)<\infty, then\Gid_{R}\H_{\fm}^{d}(M)=\depth R- d. The above results have consequences which improve some known results and provide characterizations of Gorenstein rings.
