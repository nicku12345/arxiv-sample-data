In this article we present a parallel modular algorithm to compute all solutions with multiplicities of a given zero-dimensional polynomial system of equations over the rationals. In fact, we compute a triangular decomposition using M\"oller's algorithm (cf. [M\"o93]) of the corresponding ideal in the polynomial ring over the rationals using modular methods, and then apply a solver for univariate polynomials.
