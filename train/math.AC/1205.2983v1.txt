Let N be a submodule of a finitely generated module M over a Noetherian ring. A method for the computation of the submodule generated by the envelope of N is given. The relations between weakly prime submodules and their envelopes are investigated. Using these relations, a description of the weakly radical of a submodule is obtained. The results are illustrated by examples.
