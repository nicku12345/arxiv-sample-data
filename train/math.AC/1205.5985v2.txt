Let (R,\fm) be a local ring and let C be a semidualizing R--module. In this paper, we are concerned in C--injective and G_{C}--injective dimensions of certain local cohomology modules of R. Firstly, the injective dimension of C and the above quantities of dimensions is compared. Then, as an application of the above comparisons, a characterization of a dualizing module of R is given. Finally, it is shown that if R is Cohen-Macaulay of dimension d such that \H_{\fm}^{d}(C) is C--injective, then R is Gorernstein. This is an answer to the question which was recently presented.
