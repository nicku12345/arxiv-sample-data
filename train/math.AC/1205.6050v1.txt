This paper presents an algorithm for computing Groebner bases based upon labeled polynomials and ideas from the algorithm F5. The main highlights of this algorithm compared with analogues are simplicity both of the algorithm and of the its correctness proof achieved without loss of the efficiency. This leads to simple implementation which performance is in par with more complex analogues
