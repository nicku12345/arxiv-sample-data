We first relate an approximate n^{th}-order left derivative of s(R, f^t) at the F-pure threshold c to the F-splitting ratio r_F(R, f^c). Next, we apply the methods developed by Monsky and Teixeira in their investigation of syzygy gaps and p-fractals to obtain uniform convergence of the F-signature when f is a product of distinct linear polynomials in two variables. Finally, we explicitly compute the F-signature function for several examples using Macaulay2 code outlined in the last section of this paper.
