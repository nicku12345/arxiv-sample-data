We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a standard graded Artinian ring defined by an m-full ideal, to have the weak Lefschetz property in terms of graded Betti numbers. This is a generalization of a theorem of Wiebe for componentwise linear ideals. We also prove that the class of componentwise linear ideals and that of completely m-full ideals coincide in characteristic zero and in positive characteristic, with the assumption that the generic initial ideal w.r.t. the graded reverse lexicographic order is stable.
