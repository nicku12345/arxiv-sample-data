Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, I an ideal of R and M, N two finitely generated R-modules. The aim of this paper is to investigate the I-cofiniteness of generalized local cohomology modules \displaystyle H^j_I(M,N)=\dlim\Ext^j_R(M/I^nM,N) of M and N with respect to I. We first prove that if I is a principal ideal then H^j_I(M,N) is I-cofinite for all M, N and all j. Secondly, let t be a non-negative integer such that \dim\Supp(H^j_I(M,N))\le 1 \text{for all} j<t. Then H^j_I(M,N) is I-cofinite for all j<t and \Hom(R/I,H^t_I(M,N)) is finitely generated. Finally, we show that if \dim(M)\le 2 or \dim(N)\le 2 then H^j_I(M,N) is I-cofinite for all j.
