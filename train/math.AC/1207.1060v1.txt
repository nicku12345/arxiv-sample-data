In this paper we work with several divisors of a module E \subseteq G \simeq R^{e} having rank e, such as the classical Fitting ideals of E and of G/E, and the more recently introduced (generic) Bourbaki ideals I(E) (A. Simis, B. Ulrich, and W. Vasconcelos [18]) or ideal norms [[E]]_R (O. Villamayor [22]). We found several relations and equalities among them which allow to describe in some cases universal properties with respect to E of their blow ups. As a byproduct we are also able to obtain lower bounds for the analytic spread \ell(\bigwedge^{e}E) related with the algebraic local version of Zak's inequality as explained in A. Simis, K. Smith and B. Ulrich [16].
