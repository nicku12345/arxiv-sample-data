Let \frak a, \frak b be ideals of a commutative Noetherian ring R and let M, N be finite R-modules. The concept of an \frak a-filter grade of \frak b on M is introduced and several characterizations and properties of this notion are given. Then, using the above characterizations, we obtain some results on generalized local cohomology modules H^i_{\frak a}(M, N). In particular, first we determine the least integer i for which H^i_{\frak a}(M, N) is not Artinian. Then we prove that H^i_{\frak a}(M, N) is Artinian for all i\in\mathbb N_0 if and only if \dim{R}/({\frak a+Ann M+Ann N})=0. Also, we establish the Nagel-Schenzel formula for generalized local cohomology modules. Finally, in a certain case, the set of attached primes of H^i_{\frak a}(M, N) is determined and a comparison between this set and the set of attached primes of H^i_{\frak a}(N) is given.
