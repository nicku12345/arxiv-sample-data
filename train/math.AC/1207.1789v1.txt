In this paper, we study Cstelnuovo-Mumford regularity of square-free monomial ideals generated in degree 3. We define some operations on the clutters associated to such ideals and prove that the regularity is conserved under these operations. We apply the operations to introduce some classes of ideals with linear resolutions and also show that any clutter corresponding to a triangulation of the sphere does not have linear resolution while any proper sub-clutter of it has a linear resolution.
