The paper proves that the superficial sequences in [13, 15, 16, 25] are the weak-(FC)-sequences in [18]. This follows that [18, Theorem 3.4] of Viet in 2000 covers the results of Risler and Teissier [13] in 1973; Trung [15, Theorem 3.4] in 2001; Trung and Verma [16, Theorem 1.4] in 2007. The paper unified the results for mixed multiplicities of ideals in [13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 25].
