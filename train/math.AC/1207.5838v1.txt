Let \mathbb{N} \mathcal{A} be the monoid generated by \mathcal{A} = {\mathbf{a}_1, ..., \mathbf{a}_n} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d. We introduce the homogeneous catenary degree of \mathbb{N} \mathcal{A} as the smallest N \in \mathbb N with the following property: for each \mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{N} \mathcal{A} and any two factorizations \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} of \mathbf{a}, there exists factorizations \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{w}_1, ..., \mathbf{w}_t = \mathbf{v}  of \mathbf{a} such that, for every k, \mathrm{d}(\mathbf{w}_k, \mathbf{w}_{k+1}) \leq N, where \mathrm{d} is the usual distance between factorizations, and the length of \mathbf{w}_k, |\mathbf{w}_k|, is less than or equal to \max{|\mathbf{u}|, |\mathbf{v}|}. We prove that the homogeneous catenary degree of \mathbb{N} \mathcal{A} improves the monotone catenary degree as upper bound for the ordinary catenary degree, and we show that it can be effectively computed. We also prove that for half-factorial monoids, the tame degree and the \omega-primality coincide, and that all possible catenary degrees of the elements of an affine semigroup of this kind occur as the catenary degree of one of its Betti elements.
