Given a finite set \mathbf{X} of distinct points, Marinari-Mora's 'Axis of Evil Theorem' states that a combinatorial algorithm and interpolation enable to find a 'linear' factorization for a lexicographical minimal Groebner basis \mathcal{G}(I(\mathbf{X})) of the zerodimensional radical ideal I(\mathbf{X}). In this work we provide such algorithm, showing that it ends in a finite number of steps and that it actually provides the correct result. The 'Axis of Evil' algorithm takes as input the monomial basis of the initial ideal T(I(\mathbf{X})) but its starting point is the (finite) Groebner escalier N (obtained via Cerlienco-Mureddu correspondence) so we will also define the `potential expansion' 's algorithm, a combinatorical algorithm which computes the minimal basis from a finite Groebner escalier.
