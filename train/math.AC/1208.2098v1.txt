Let I be an ideal of a local ring (R,\mathfrak m) with d = \dim R. For the local cohomology module H^i_I(R) it is a well-known fact that it vanishes for i > d and is an Artinian R-module for i = d. In the case that the Hartshorne-Lichtenbaum Vanishing Theorem fails, that is H^d_I(R) \not= 0, we explore its fine structure. In particular, we investigate its endomorphism ring and related connectedness properties. In the case R is complete we prove - as a technical tool - that H^d_I(R) \simeq H^d_{\mathfrak m}(R/J) for a certain ideal J \subset R. Thus, properties of H^d_I(R) and its Matlis dual might be described in terms of the local cohomology supported in the maximal ideal.
