We study almost complete intersections ideals whose Rees algebras are extremal in the sense that some of their fundamental metrics---depth or relation type---have maximal or minimal values in the class. The focus is on those ideals that lead to almost Cohen--Macaulay algebras and our treatment is wholly concentrated on the nonlinear relations of the algebras. Several classes of such algebras are presented, some of a combinatorial origin. We offer a different prism to look at these questions with accompanying techniques. The main results are effective methods to calculate the invariants of these algebras.
