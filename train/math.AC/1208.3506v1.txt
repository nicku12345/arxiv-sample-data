In this paper we study Hilbert functions and isomorphism classes of Artinian level local algebras via Macaulay's inverse system. Upper and lower bounds concerning numerical functions admissible for level algebras of fixed type and socle degree are known. For each value in this range we exhibit a level local algebra with that Hilbert function, provided that the socle degree is at most three. Furthermore we prove that level local algebras of socle degree three and maximal Hilbert function are graded. In the graded case the extremal strata have been parametrized by Cho and Iarrobino.
