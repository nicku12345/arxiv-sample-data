Let R=k[|t^a,t^b,t^c|] be a complete intersection numerical semigroup ring over an infinite field k, where a,b,c\in\BN. The generalized Loewy length, which is Auslander's index in this case, is computed in terms of the minimal generators of the semigroup: a,b and c. Examples provided show that the left hand side of Ding's inequality \mult(R)-\inde(R)-\codim(R)+1\geq 0 can be made arbitrarily large for rings R with \edim(R)=3 . The index of a complete intersection numerical semigroup ring with embedding dimension greater than three is also computed.
