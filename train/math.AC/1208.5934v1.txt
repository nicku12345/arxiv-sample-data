This paper is concerned about the relation between local cohomology modules defined by a pair of ideals and Serre classes of R-modules, as a generalization of results of J. Azami, R. Naghipour and B. Vakili (2009) and M. Asgharzadeh and M.Tousi (2010). Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, I, J be two ideals of R and M be an R-module. Let a\in \~{W}(I; J) and t \in N_0 be such that Ext^t_R(R/a,M)\in S and Ext^j_R(R/a,H^i_I;J(M))\inS for all i < t and all j>=0. Then for any submodule N of H^t_I;J(M) such that Ext^1_R(R/a;N)\in,we obtain HomR(R=a;H^t_I;J(M)/N)\inS.
