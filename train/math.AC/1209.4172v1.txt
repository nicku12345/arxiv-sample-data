Suppose F is a field with valuation v and valuation ring O_{v}, E is a finite field extension and w is a quasi-valuation on E extending v. We study quasi-valuations on E that extend v; in particular, their corresponding rings and their prime spectrums. We prove that these ring extensions satisfy INC (incomparability), LO (lying over), and GD (going down) over O_{v}; in particular, they have the same Krull Dimension. We also prove that every such quasi-valuation is dominated by some valuation extending v.   Under the assumption that the value monoid of the quasi-valuation is a group we prove that these ring extensions satisfy GU (going up) over O_{v}, and a bound on the size of the prime spectrum is given. In addition, a 1:1 correspondence is obtained between exponential quasi-valuations and integrally closed quasi-valuation rings.   Given R, an algebra over O_{v}, we construct a quasi-valuation on R; we also construct a quasi-valuation on R \otimes_{O_{v}} F which helps us prove our main Theorem. The main Theorem states that if R \subseteq E satisfies R \cap F=O_{v} and E is the field of fractions of R, then R and v induce a quasi-valuation w on E such that R=O_{w} and w extends v; thus R satisfies the properties of a quasi-valuation ring.
