Consider the ideal I corresponding to r points in P^2. We study the symbolic generic initial system of I, formed by taking the generic initial ideals of the symbolic powers of I, and its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, we describe the limiting shape of this system explicitly when the points lie in general position using the SHGH Conjecture for more than eight points. The symbolic generic initial system and its limiting shape reflects information about the Hilbert functions of uniform fat point ideals.
