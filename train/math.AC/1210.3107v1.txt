In this article, we study the following question raised by Mel Hochster: let (R,m,K) be a local ring and S be a flat extension with regular closed fiber. Is \cV(mS)\cap\Ass_S H^i_I(S) finite for every ideal I\subset S and i\in \NN? We prove that the answer is positive when S is either a polynomial or a power series ring over R and \dim(R/I\cap R)\leq 1. In addition, we analyze when this question can be reduced to the case where S is a power series ring over R. An important tool for our proof is the use of \Sigma-finite D-modules, which are not necessarily finitely generated as D-modules, but whose associated primes are finite. We give examples of this class of D-modules and applications to local cohomology.
