We give an application of the New Intersection Theorem and prove the following: let R be a local complete intersection ring of codimension c and let M and N be nonzero finitely generated R-modules. Assume n is a nonnegative integer and that the tensor product M\tensor_{R}N is an (n+c)th syzygy of some finitely generated R-module. If Tor^{R}_{>0}(M,N)=0, then both M and N are nth syzygies of some finitely generated R-modules.
