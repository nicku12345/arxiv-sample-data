Consider the ideal I in K[x,y,z] corresponding to six points of P2. We study the limiting behaviour of the symbolic generic initial system, of I obtained by taking the reverse lexicographic generic initial ideals of the symbolic powers of I. The main result of this paper is a theorem describing the limiting shape of the symbolic generic initial system for each of the eleven possible configuration types of six points.
