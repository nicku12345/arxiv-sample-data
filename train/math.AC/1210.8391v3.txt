It is well known that nice conditions on the canonical module of a local ring have a strong impact in the study of strong F-regularity and F-purity. In this note, we prove that if (R,m) is an equidimensional and S_2 local ring that admits a canonical ideal I such that R/I is F-pure, then R is F-pure. We also provide examples to show that not all Cohen-Macaulay F-pure local rings satisfy this property.
