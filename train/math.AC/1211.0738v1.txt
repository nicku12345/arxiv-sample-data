Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring and Q a parameter ideal of R. Suppose that an acyclic complex of length 3 which is an R-free resolution of an ideal I of R is given. In this paper, we describe a concrete procedure to get an acyclic complex of length 3 that becomes an R-free resolution of I : Q. As an application, we compute the symbolic powers of ideals generated by maximal minors of certain 2 x 3 matrices.
