This paper defines mixed multiplicity systems; the Euler-Poincare characteristic and the mixed multiplicity symbol of \mathbb{N}^d-graded modules with respect to a mixed multiplicity system, and proves that the Euler-Poincare characteristic and the mixed multiplicity symbol of any mixed multiplicity system of the type (k_1,\ldots,k_d) and the (k_1,\ldots,k_d)-difference of the Hilbert polynomial are the same. As an application, we get results for mixed multiplicities.
