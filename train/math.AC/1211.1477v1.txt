Let (R,\frak{m}) be a Noetherian local ring, I an ideal of R and N a finitely generated R-module. Let k{\ge}-1 be an integer and  r=\depth_k(I,N) the length of a maximal N-sequence in dimension >k in I defined by M. Brodmann and L. T. Nhan ({Comm. Algebra, 36 (2008), 1527-1536). For a subset S\subseteq \Spec R we set S_{{\ge}k}={\p\in S\mid\dim(R/\p){\ge}k}. We first prove in this paper that \Ass_R(H^j_I(N))_{\ge k} is a finite set for all j{\le}r}. Let \fN=\oplus_{n\ge 0}N_n be a finitely generated graded \fR-module, where \fR is a finitely generated standard graded algebra over R_0=R. Let r be the eventual value of \depth_k(I,N_n). Then our second result says that for all l{\le}r the sets \bigcup_{j{\le}l}\Ass_R(H^j_I(N_n))_{{\ge}k} are stable for large n.
