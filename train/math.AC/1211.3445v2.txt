For a local Cohen-Macaulay ring R of finite CM-type, Yoshino has applied methods of Auslander and Reiten to compute the Grothendieck group of the category mod(R) of finitely generated R-modules. For the same type of rings we compute in this paper the first Quillen K-group of mod(R). We also describe the group homomorphism induced by the inclusion of proj(R) into mod(R) and illustrate our results with concrete examples.
