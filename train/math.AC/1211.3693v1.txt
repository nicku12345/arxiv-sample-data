In this paper we present and study the numerical duplication of a numerical semigroup, a construction that, starting with a numerical semigroup S and a semigroup ideal E\subseteq S, produces a new numerical semigroup, denoted by S\Join^b\E (where b is any odd integer belonging to S), such that S=(S\Join^b\E)/2. In particular, we characterize the ideals E such that S\Join^bE is almost symmetric and we determine its type.
