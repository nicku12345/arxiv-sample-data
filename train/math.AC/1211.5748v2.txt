Let I be an ideal of a Noetherian ring R and M be a finitely generated R-module. We introduce the class of extension modules of finitely generated modules by the class of all modules T with \dim T\leq n and we show it by {\rm FD_{\leq n}} where n\geq -1 is an integer. We prove that for any {\rm FD_{\leq 0}}(or minimax) submodule N of H^t_I(M) the R-modules {\rm Hom}_R(R/I,H^{t}_I(M)/N) {\rm and} {\rm Ext}^1_R(R/I,H^{t}_I(M)/N) are finitely generated, whenever the modules H^0_I(M), H^1_I(M), ..., H^{t-1}_I(M) are {\rm FD_{\leq 1}} (or weakly Laskerian). As a consequence, it follows that the associated primes of H^{t}_I(M)/N are finite. This generalizes the main results of Bahmanpour and Naghipour, Brodmann and Lashgari, Khashyarmanesh and Salarian, and Hong Quy. We also show that the category \mathscr {FD}^1(R,I)_{cof} of I-cofinite {\rm FD_{\leq1}} ~ R-modules forms an Abelian subcategory of the category of all R-modules.
