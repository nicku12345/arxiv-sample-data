Given positive integers e and s we consider Gorenstein Artinian local rings R of embedding dimension e whose maximal ideal \mathfrak{m} satisfies \mathfrak{m}^s\ne 0=\mathfrak{m}^{s+1}. We say that R is a compressed Gorenstein local ring when it has maximal length among such rings. It is known that generic Gorenstein Artinian algebras are compressed. If s\ne 3, we prove that the Poincare series of all finitely generated modules over a compressed Gorenstein local ring are rational, sharing a common denominator. A formula for the denominator is given. When s is even this formula depends only on the integers e and s. Note that for s=3 examples of compressed Gorenstein local rings with transcendental Poincare series exist, due to B{\o}gvad.
