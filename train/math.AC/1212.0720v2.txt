We prove in particular that the Gorenstein numerical semigroup ring generated by (36,48,50,52,56,60,66,67,107,121,129,135) has a transcendental series of Betti numbers. The methods of proofs are the theory of Golod homomorphism and the theory of infinite positively graded Lie algebras. This paper is more than twice as long as earlier 1212.0720, has two extra authors and has new general results about decomposition of graded Lie algebras (theorems 2,3 and 4) in the new section 4.
