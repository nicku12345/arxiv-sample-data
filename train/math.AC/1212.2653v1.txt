It has been conjectured by Eisenbud, Green and Harris that if I is a homogeneous ideal in k[x_1,...,x_n] containing a regular sequence f_1,...,f_n of degrees \deg(f_i)=a_i, where 2\leq a_1\leq ... \leq a_n, then there is a homogeneous ideal J containing x_1^{a_1},...,x_n^{a_n} with the same Hilbert function. In this paper we prove the Eisenbud-Green-Harris conjecture when f_i splits into linear factors for all i.
