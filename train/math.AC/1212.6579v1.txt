Let S be a positively graded polynomial ring over a field of characteristic 0, and I\subset S a proper graded ideal. In this note it is shown that S/I is Golod if \partial(I)^2\subset I. Here \partial(I) denotes the ideal generated by all the partial derivatives of elements of I. We apply this result to find large classes of Golod ideals, including powers, symbolic powers, and saturations of ideals.
