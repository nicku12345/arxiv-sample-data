Binomial edge ideals IG of a graph G were introduced by [4]. They found some classes of graphs G with the property that IG is a Cohen-Macaulay ideal. This might happen only for few classes of graphs. A certain generalization of being Cohen-Macaulay, named approximately Cohen-Macaulay, was introduced by S. Goto in [3]. We study classes of graphs whose binomial edge ideal are approximately Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover we use some homological methods in order to compute their Hilbert series.
