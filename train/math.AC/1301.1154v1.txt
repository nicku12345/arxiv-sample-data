We prove here that the elements of any standard basis of I^n, where I is an ideal of a Noetherian local ring and n is a positive integer, have order bounded by a linear function in n. We deduce from this that the elements of any standard basis of I^n in the sense of Grauert-Hironaka, where I is an ideal of the ring of power series, have order bounded by a polynomial function in n.
