We define what it means for a Cohen-Macaulay ring to to be super-stretched and show that Cohen-Macaulay rings of graded countable Cohen-Macaulay type are super-stretched. We use this result to show that rings of graded countable Cohen-Macaulay type, and positive dimension, have possible h-vectors (1), (1,n), or (1,n,1). Further, one dimensional standard graded Gorenstein rings of graded countable type are shown to be hypersurfaces; this result is not known in higher dimensions. In the non-Gorenstein case, rings of graded countable Cohen-Macaulay type of dimension larger than 2 are shown to be of minimal multiplicity.
