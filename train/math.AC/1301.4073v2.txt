Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by pi. Let f(X) in R[X] be a monic polynomial with nonzero discriminant Delta(f). Let s >= v_pi(Delta(f)) + 1. Suppose given a factorisation of f(X) in (R/pi^s R)[X] into several factors, not necessarily coprime in (R/pi R)[X]. We lift it uniquely to a factorisation of f(X) in R[X]. This generalises the Hensel-Rychlik Lemma, which covers the case of two factors. We work directly with lifts of factorisations into several factors and avoid having to iterate factorisations into two factors. For this purpose we define a resultant for several polynomials in one variable as determinant of a generalised Sylvester matrix.
