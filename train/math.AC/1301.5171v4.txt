Let I\supsetneq J be two squarefree monomial ideals of a polynomial algebra over a field. Suppose that I is generated by one squarefree monomial of degree  d>0, and other squarefree monomials of degrees \geq d+1. If the Stanley depth of I/J is \leq d+1 then almost always the usual depth of I/J is \leq d+1 too.
