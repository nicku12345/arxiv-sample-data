The Qth-power algorithm produces a useful canonical P-module presentation for the integral closures of certain integral extensions of P:=\mathbf{F}[x_n,...,x_1], a polyonomial ring over the finite field \mathbf{F}:=\mathbf{Z}_q of q elements. Here it is shown how to use this for several small primes q to reconstruct similar integral closures over the rationals \mathbf{Q} using the Chinese remainder theorem to piece together presentations in different positive characteristics, and the extended Euclidean algorithm to reconstruct rational fractions to lift these to presentations over \mathbf{Q}.
