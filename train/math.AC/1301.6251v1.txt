Let k[X]=k[x_0,...,x_{n-1}] and k[Y]=k[y_0,...,y_{n-1}] be the polynomial rings in n\geqslant 3 variables over a field k of characteristic zero containing the n-th roots of unity. Let d be the cyclotomic derivation of k[X], and let \Delta be the factorisable derivation of k[Y] associated with d, that is, d(x_j)=x_{j+1} and \Delta(y_j)=y_j(y_{j+1}-y_j) for all j\in\mathbb Z_n. We describe polynomial constants and rational constants of these derivations. We prove, among others, that the field of constants of d is a field of rational functions over k in n-\f(n) variables, and that the ring of constants of d is a polynomial ring if and only if n is a power of a prime. Moreover, we show that the ring of constants of \Delta is always equal to k[v], where v is the product y_0... y_{n-1}, and we describe the field of constants of \Delta in two cases: when n is power of a prime, and when n=p q.
