Let K be a field and S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_m, y_1,\ldots,y_n] be the standard bigraded polynomial ring over K. In this paper, we explicitly describe the structure of finitely generated bigraded "sequentially Cohen--Macaulay" S-modules with respect to Q=(y_1,\ldots,y_n). Next, we give a characterization of sequentially Cohen--Macaulay modules with respect to Q in terms of local cohomology modules. Cohen--Macaulay modules that are sequentially Cohen--Macaulay with respect to Q are considered.
