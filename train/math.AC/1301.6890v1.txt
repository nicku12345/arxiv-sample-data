Let R be a (commutative Noetherian) local ring of prime characteristic that is F-pure. This paper studies a certain finite set {\mathcal I} of radical ideals of R that is naturally defined by the injective envelope of the simple R-module. This set {\mathcal I} contains 0 and R, and is closed under taking primary components. For a multiplicatively closed subset S of R, the concept of tight closure with respect to S, or S-tight closure, is discussed, together with associated concepts of S-test element and S-test ideal. It is shown that an ideal of R belongs to {\mathcal I} if and only if it is the S'-test ideal of R for some multiplicatively closed subset S' of R. When R is complete, {\mathcal I} is also `closed under taking test ideals', in the following sense: for each proper ideal C in {\mathcal I}, it turns out that R/C is again F-pure, and if J and K are the unique ideals of R that contain C and are such that J/C is the (tight closure) test ideal of R/C and K/C is the big test ideal of R/C, then both J and K belong to {\mathcal I}. The paper ends with several examples.
