We study the finite generation of the intersection algebra of two principal ideals I and J in a unique factorization domain R. We provide an algorithm that produces a list of generators of this algebra over R. In the special case that R is a polynomial ring, this algorithm has been implemented in the commutative algebra software system Macaulay2. A new class of algebras, called fan algebras, is introduced.
