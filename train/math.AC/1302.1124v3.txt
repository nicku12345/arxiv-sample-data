Let B be an affine Cohen-Macaulay algebra over a field of characteristic p. For every prime ideal \mathfrak{p}\subset B, let \text{H}_\mathfrak{p} denote H^{\dim B_\mathfrak{p}}_{\mathfrak{p} B_\mathfrak{p}}\left( \widehat{B_\mathfrak{p}} \right). Each such \text{H}_\mathfrak{p} is an Artinian module endowed with a natural Frobenius map \Theta and if \text{Nil}(\text{H}_\mathfrak{p}) denotes the set of all elements in \text{H}_\mathfrak{p} killed by some power of \Theta then a theorem by Hartshorne-Speiser and Lyubeznik shows that there exists an e\geq 0 such that \Theta^e \text{Nil}(\text{H}_\mathfrak{p})=0. The smallest such e is the HSL-number of \text{H}_\mathfrak{p} which we denote \text{HSL}(\text{H}_\mathfrak{p}). The main theorem in this paper shows that for all e>0, the sets \{ \mathfrak{p}\in\text{Spec} (B) \,|\, \text{HSL}(\text{H}_\mathfrak{p}) < e \} are Zariski open, hence HSL is upper semi-continuous. An application of this result gives a global test exponent for the calculation of Frobenius closures of parameter ideals in Cohen-Macaulay rings.
