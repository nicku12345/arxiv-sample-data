Let \mathfrak{a} be an ideal of a local ring (R, \mathfrak{m}) with c = \mathrm{cd}(\mathfrak{a},R) the cohomological dimension of \mathfrak{a} in R. In the case that c=\dim R, we first give a bound for depth~D(H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R)), where c>2 and (R,\mathfrak{m}) is complete. Later, H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R) \otimes_R H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R), D(H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R)) \otimes_R D(H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R)) and H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R) \otimes_R D(H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R)) are examined. In the case c=\dim R-1, the set Att_R H^c_\mathfrak{a}(R) is considered.
