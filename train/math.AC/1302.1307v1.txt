Let (A,\m) be a \CM \ local ring with an infinite residue field and let I be an \m-primary ideal. Let \bx = x_1,\ldots,x_r be a A-superficial sequence \wrt \ I. Set \Vc_I(\bx) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 1} \frac{I^{n+1}\cap (\bx)}{\bx I^n}.  A consequence of a theorem due to Valabrega and Valla is that \Vc_I(\bx) = 0 \ff \ the initial forms x_1^*,\ldots,x_r^* is a G_I(A) regular sequence. Furthermore this holds if and only if \depth G_I(A) \geq r. We show that if \depth G_I(A) < r then \[ \af_r(I)= \bigcap_{\substack{\text{\bx = x_1,\ldots,x_r is a} \\ \text{A-superficial sequence w.r.t I}}} \ann_A \Vc_I(\bx) \quad \ \text{is} \ \m\text{-primary}. \] Suprisingly we also prove that under the same hypotheses, \[ \bigcap_{n\geq 1} \af_r(I^n) \quad \ \text{is also} \ \m\text{-primary}. \]
