In this paper we introduce a method of characteristic sets with respect to several term orderings for difference-differential polynomials. Using this technique, we obtain a method of computation of multivariate dimension polynomials of finitely generated difference-differential field extensions. Furthermore, we find new invariants of such extensions and show how the computation of multivariate difference-differential polynomials is applied to the equivalence problem for systems of algebraic difference-differential equations.
