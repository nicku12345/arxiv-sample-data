For finitely generated modules M and N over a complete intersection R, the vanishing of Tor_i^R(M,N) for all i> 0 gives a tight relationship among depth properties of M, N and their tensor product. Here we concentrate on the converse and show, under mild conditions, that the tensor product of M and N being torsion-free (or satisfying higher Serre conditions) forces vanishing of Tor. Special attention is paid to the case of tensor powers of a single module.
