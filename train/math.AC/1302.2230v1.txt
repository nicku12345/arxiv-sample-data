Let \mathcal{S} be a class of finitely presented R-modules such that R\in \mathcal{S} and \mathcal{S} has a subset \mathcal{S}^*, with the property that for any U\in \mathcal{S} there is a U^*\in \mathcal{S}^* with U^*\cong U. We show that the class of \mathcal{S}-pure injective R-modules is preenveloping. As an application, we deduce that the left global \mathcal{S}-pure projective dimension of R is equal to its left global \mathcal{S}-pure injective dimension. As our main result, we prove that, in fact, the class of \mathcal{S}-pure injective R-modules is enveloping.
