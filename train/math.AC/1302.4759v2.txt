Mott noted a one-to-one correspondence between saturated multiplicatively closed subsets of a domain D and directed convex subgroups of the group of divisibility D. With this, we construct a functor between inclusions into saturated localizations of D and projections onto partially ordered quotient groups of G(D). We use this functor to construct many cochain complexes of o-homomorphisms of po-groups. These complexes naturally lead to some fundamental structure theorems and some natural homology theory that provide insight into the factorization behavior of D.
