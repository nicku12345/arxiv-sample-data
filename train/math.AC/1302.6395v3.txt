Let \fa be an ideal of a Noetherian local ring R and let C be a semidualizing R-module. For an R-module X, we denote any of the quantities \fd_R X, \Gfd_R X and \GCfd_RX by \T(X). Let M be an R-module such that \H_{\fa}^i(M)=0 for all i\neq n. It is proved that if \T(X)<\infty, then \T(\H_{\fa}^n(M))\leq\T(M)+n and the equality holds whenever M is finitely generated. With the aid of these results, among other things, we characterize Cohen-Macaulay modules, dualizing modules and Gorenstein rings.
