Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring and let \fa be a proper ideal of R. A non-zero finitely generated R-module M is called relative Cohen-Macaulay with respect to \fa if there is precisely one non vanishing local cohomology modules \H_{\fa}^{i}(M) of M. In this paper, as a main result, it is shown that if M is a Gorenstein R--module, then \H_{\fa}^{i}(M)=0 for all i\neq c where c=\h_{M}\fa is completely encoded in homological properties of \H_{\fa}^{c}(M), in particular in its Bass numbers. Notice that, this result provides a generalization of a result of M. Hellus and P. Schenzel which has been proved before, as a main result, in the case where M=R.
