We introduce a notion of generalized local cohomology modules with respect to a pair of ideals (I,J) which is a generalization of the concept of local cohomology modules with respect to (I,J).   We show that generalized local cohomology modules H^i_{I,J}(M,N) can be computed by the \v{C}ech cohomology modules. We also study the artinianness of generalized local cohomology modules H^i_{I,J}(M,N).
