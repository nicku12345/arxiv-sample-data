We study spaces M(R(y)) of \R-places of rational function fields R(y) in one variable. For extensions F|R of formally real fields, with R real closed and satisfying a natural condition, we find embeddings of M(R(y)) in M(F(y)) and prove uniqueness results. Further, we study embeddings of products of spaces of the form M(F(y)) in spaces of \R-places of rational function fields in several variables. Our results uncover rather unexpected obstacles to a positive solution of the open question whether the torus can be realized as a space of \R-places.
