Let R = k[w, x_1,..., x_n]/I be a graded Gorenstein Artin algebra . Then I = \ann F for some F in the divided power algebra k_{DP}[W, X_1,..., X_n]. If RI_2 is a height one idealgenerated by n quadrics, then I_2 \subset (w) after a possible change of variables. Let J = I \cap k[x_1,..., x_n]. Then \mu(I) \le \mu(J)+n+1 and I is said to be generic if \mu(I) = \mu(J) + n+1. In this article we prove necessary conditions, in terms of F, for an ideal to be generic. With some extra assumptions on the exponents of terms of F, we obtain a characterization for I = \ann F to be generic in codimension four.
