Let K be an arbitrary field. Let \a = (a_1< ... <a_n) be a sequence of positive integers. Let C(\a) be the affine monomial curve in {\mathbb A}^n parametrized by t\to (t^{a_1}, ..., t^{a_n}). Let I(\a) be the defining ideal of C(\a) in K[x_1, ..., x_n]. For each positive integer j, let \a+j be the sequence (a_1 + j, ..., a_n+j). In this paper, we prove the conjecture of Herzog and Srinivasan saying that the betti numbers of I(\a + j) are eventually periodic in j with period a_n -a_1. When j is large enough, we describe the betti table for the closure of C(\a+j) in \PP^n.
