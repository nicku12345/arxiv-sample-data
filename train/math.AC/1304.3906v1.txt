We prove that the Eliahou-Kervaire resolution of a Cohen-Macaulay stable monomial is supported by a regular CW complex whose underlying space is a closed ball. We also show that the modified Eliahou-Kervaire resolutions of variants of a Borel fixed ideal (e.g., a squarefree strongly stable ideal) are supported by regular CW complexes, and their underlying spaces are closed balls in the Cohen-Macaulay case.
