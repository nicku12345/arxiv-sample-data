Let \sigma:A\rightarrow B and \rho:A\rightarrow C\ be two homomorphisms of noetherian rings such that B\otimes_{A}C is a noetherian ring. we show that if \sigma is a regular (resp. complete intersection, resp. Gorenstein, resp. Cohen-Macaulay, resp. (S_{n}), resp. almost Cohen-Macaulay) homomorphism, so is \sigma\otimes I_{C} and the converse is true if \rho is faithfully flat.   We deduce the transfert of the previous properties of B and C for B\otimes_{A}C, and then for the completed tensor product B\hat{\otimes}_{A}C. If B\otimes_{A}B is noetherian and \sigma is flat, we give a necessary and sufficient condition to B\otimes_{A}B be a regular ring.
