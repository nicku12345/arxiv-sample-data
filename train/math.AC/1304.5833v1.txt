We consider the following question concerning the equality of ordinary and symbolic powers of ideals. In a regular local ring, if the ordinary and symbolic powers of a one-dimensional prime ideal are the same up to its height, then are they the same for all powers? We provide supporting evidence of a positive answer for classes of prime ideals defining monomial curves or rings of low multiplicities.
