Let k[X] = k[x_{i,j}: i = 1,..., m; j = 1,..., n] be the polynomial ring in m n variables x_{i,j} over a field k of arbitrary characteristic. Denote by I_2(X) the ideal generated by the 2 \times 2 minors of the generic m \times n matrix [x_{i,j}]. We give a closed formulation for the dimensions of the k-vector space k[X]/(I_2(X) + (x_{1,1}^q,..., x_{m,n}^q)) as q varies over all positive integers, i.e., we give a closed form for the generalized Hilbert-Kunz function of the determinantal ring k[X]/I_{2}[X]. We also give a closed formulation of dimensions of related quotients of k[X]/I_{2}[X]. In the process we establish a formula for the numbers of some compositions (ordered partitions of integers), and we give a proof of a new binomial identity.
