Let R be a Noetherian ring, I and J two ideals of R and t an integer. Let S be the class of Artinian R-modules, or the class of all R-modules N with \dim_RN\leq k, where k is an integer. It is proved that \inf\{i: H^{i}_{I,J}(M)\notin S\}=\inf\{S-\depth_\frak{a}(M): \frak{a}\in \tilde{\rm W}(I,J)\}, where M is a finitely generated R-module, or is a ZD-module such that M/\frak{a}M\notin S for all \frak{a}\in \tilde{\rm W}(I,J). Let \Supp_R H^{i}_{I,J}(M) be a finite subset of \Max(R) for all i<t. It is shown that there are maximal ideals \frak m_1, \frak m_2,\ldots,\frak m_k of R such that H^{i}_{I,J}(M)\cong H^{i}_{\frak m_1}(M)\oplus H^{i}_{\frak m_2}(M)\oplus\cdots\oplus H^{i}_{\frak m_k}(M) for all i<t.
