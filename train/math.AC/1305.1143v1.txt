In recent papers, R. Bhatia, T. Jain and P. Grover obtained formulas for directional derivatives, of all orders, of the determinant, the permanent, the m-th compound map and the m-th induced power map. In this paper we generalize these results for immanants and for other symmetric powers of a matrix.
