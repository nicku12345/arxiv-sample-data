A homogeneous ideal I of a polynomial ring S is said to have the Rees property if, for any homogeneous ideal J \subset S  which contains I, the number of generators of J is smaller than or equal to that of I. A homogeneous ideal I \subset S is said to be \mathfrak m-full if \mathfrak mI:y=I for some y \in \mathfrak m, where \mathfrak m is the graded maximal ideal of S. It was proved by one of the authors that \mathfrak m-full ideals have the Rees property and that the converse holds in a polynomial ring with two variables. In this note, we give examples of ideals which have the Rees property but are not \mathfrak m-full in a polynomial ring with more than two variables. To prove this result, we also show that every Artinian monomial almost complete intersection in three variables has the Sperner property.
