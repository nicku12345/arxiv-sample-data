Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension one with a canonical module \rm{K_R}. Let I be a faithful ideal of R. We explore the problem of when I \otimes_RI^{\vee} is torsionfree, where I^{\vee} = \operatorname{Hom_R(I, \rm{K_R})}. We prove that if R has multiplicity at most 6, then I is isomorphic to R or \rm{K_R} as an R-module, once I\otimes_RI^{\vee} is torsionfree. This result is applied to monomial ideals of numerical semigroup rings. A higher dimensional assertion is also discussed.
