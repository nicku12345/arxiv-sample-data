Let R be a Noetherian local ring, I and J two ideals of R, M an R-module and s and t two integers. We study the relationship between the Bass numbers of M and H^{i}_{I,J}(M). We show that   \mu^t(M)\leq\sum_{i=0}^{t}\mu^{t-i}(H^{i}_{I,J}(M)) and \mu^s(H^{t}_{I,J}(M))\leq \sum_{i=0}^{t-1}\mu^{s+t+1-i}(H^{i}_{I,J}(M))+\mu^{s+t}(M)+\sum_{i=t+1}^{s+t-1}\mu^{s+t-1-i}(H^{i}_{I,J}(M)).   As a consequence, it follows that if I is a principal ideal of R and M is a minimax R-module, then \mu^j(H^{i}_{I,J}(M)) is finite for all i\in\Bbb N_0 and all j\in\Bbb N_0.
