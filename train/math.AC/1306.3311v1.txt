Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) denote a local ring with E = E_R(R/\mathfrak{m}) the injective hull of the residue field. Let \mathfrak{p} \in \Spec R denote a prime ideal with \dim R/\mathfrak{p} = 1, and let E_R(R/\mathfrak{p}) be the injective hull of R/\mathfrak{p}. As the main result we prove that the Matlis dual \Hom_R(E_R(R/\mathfrak{p}), E) is isomorphic to \hat{R_{\mathfrak{p}}}, the completion of R_{\mathfrak{p}}, if and only if R/\mathfrak{p} is complete. In the case of R a one dimensional domain there is a complete description of Q \otimes_R \hat{R} in terms of the completion \hat{R}.
