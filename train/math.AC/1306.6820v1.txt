Let (R,\my) be a noetherian local ring, E the injective hull of k=R/\my and M^\circ= Hom_R(M,E) the Matlis dual of the R-module M. If the canonical monomorphism \varphi: M \to \moo is surjective, M is known to be called (Matlis-)reflexive. With the help of the Bass numbers \mu(\py,M)=\dim_{\kappa(\py)}(Hom_R(R/\py,M)_\py) of M with respect to \py we show: M is reflexive if and only if \mu(\py,M)=\mu(\py,\moo) for all \py \in  Spec(R). From this it follows for every R-module M: If there exists a monomorphism \moo \hookrightarrow M or an epimorphism M \twoheadrightarrow \moo, then M is already reflexive.
