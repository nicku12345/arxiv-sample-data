Differential graded (DG) commutative algebra provides powerful techniques for proving theorems about modules over commutative rings. These notes are a somewhat colloquial introduction to these techniques. In order to provide some motivation for commutative algebraists who are wondering about the benefits of learning and using these techniques, we present them in the context of a recent result of Nasseh and Sather-Wagstaff. These notes were used for the course "Differential Graded Commutative Algebra" that was part of the Workshop on Connections Between Algebra and Geometry held at the University of Regina, May 29--June 1, 2012.
