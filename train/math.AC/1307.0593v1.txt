Let R be a Noetherian local ring and m a positive integer. Let I be the ideal of R generated by the maximal minors of an m \times (m + 1) matrix M with entries in R. Assuming that the grade of the ideal generated by the k-minors of M is at least m - k + 2 for 1 \leq \forall k \leq m, we will study the associated primes of I^n for \forall n > 0. Moreover, we compute the saturation of I^n for 1 \leq \forall n \leq m in the case where R is a Cohen-Macaulay ring and the entries of M are powers of elements that form an sop for R.
