Let R be an n-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring and Q a parameter ideal of R. Suppose that an acyclic complex (F_{\bullet}, \varphi_{\bullet}) of length n of finitely generated free R-modules is given. We put M = Im \varphi_{1}, which is an R-submodule of F_{0}. Then F_{\bullet} is an R-free resolution of F_{0}/M. In this paper, we describe a concrete procedure to get an acyclic complex of length n that resolves F_{0}/(M : Q).
