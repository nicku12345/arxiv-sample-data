Let K be a field of characteristic zero, R = K[X_1,...,X_n]. Let A_n(K) = K<X_1,...,X_n, \partial_1, ..., \partial_n> be the n^{th} Weyl algebra over K. We consider the case when R and A_n(K) is graded by giving \deg X_i = \omega_i  and \deg \partial_i = -\omega_i for i =1,...,n (here \omega_i are positive integers). Set \omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\omega_k. Let I be a graded ideal in R. By a result due to Lyubeznik the local cohomology modules H^i_I(R) are holonomic A_n(K)-modules for each i \geq 0. In this article we prove that the De Rahm cohomology modules H^*(\bP ; H^*_I(R)) is concentrated in degree - \omega, i.e., H^*(\bP ; H^*_I(R))_j = 0 for j \neq - \omega. As an application when A = R/(f) is an isolated singularity we relate H^{n-1}(\bP ; H^1_{(f)}(R) to H^{n-1}(\partial(f); A), the (n-1)^{th} Koszul cohomology of A \wrt \  \partial_1(f),...,\partial_n(f).
