Let (R,\m) be an analytically unramified Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension 2 with infinite residue field and \ov{I} be the integral closure of an ideal I in R. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for \ov{I^{r+1}J^{s+1}}=a\ov{I^rJ^{s+1}}+b\ov{I^{r+1}J^s} to hold {for all}r \geq r_0{and}s \geq s_0 in terms of vanishing of [H^2_{(at_1,bt_2)}(\ov{\mathcal{R}^\prime}(I,J))]_{(r_0,s_0)}, where a \in I,b \in J is a good joint reduction of the filtration \{\ov{I^rJ^s}\}. This is used to derive a theorem due to Rees on normal joint reduction number zero. The vanishing of \ov{e}_2(IJ) is shown to be equivalent to Cohen-Macaulayness of \ov{\mathcal{R}}(I,J).
