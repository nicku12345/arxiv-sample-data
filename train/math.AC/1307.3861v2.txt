Let R=\bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Gamma}R_{\alpha} be a graded integral domain graded by an arbitrary grading torsionless monoid \Gamma, and \star be a semistar operation on R. In this paper we define and study the graded integral domain analogue of \star-Nagata and Kronecker function rings of R with respect to \star. We say that R is a graded Pr\"{u}fer \star-multiplication domain if each nonzero finitely generated homogeneous ideal of R is \star_f-invertible. Using \star-Nagata and Kronecker function rings, we give several different equivalent conditions for R to be a graded Pr\"{u}fer \star-multiplication domain. In particular we give new characterizations for a graded integral domain, to be a PvMD.
