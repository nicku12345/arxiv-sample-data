Let K be a field of characteristic 0 and consider exterior algebras of finite dimensional K-vector spaces. In this short paper we exhibit principal quadric ideals in a family whose Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is unbounded. This negatively answers the analogue of Stillman's Question for exterior algebras posed by I. Peeva. We show that these examples are dual to modules over polynomial rings that yield counterexamples to a conjecture of J. Herzog on the Betti numbers in the linear strand of syzygy modules.
