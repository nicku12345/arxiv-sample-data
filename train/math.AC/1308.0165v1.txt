Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and let R = K[X_1,\ldots,X_n]. Let I be an ideal in R. Let A_n(K) be the n^{th} Weyl algebra over K. By a result of Lyubeznik, the local cohomology modules H^i_I(R) are holonomic A_n(K)-modules for each i \geq 0. In this paper we compute the Euler characteristic of De-Rahm cohomology of H^{\htt P}_P(R) for certain classes of prime ideals P in R.
