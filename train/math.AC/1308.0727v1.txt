Let R be a commutative chain ring. We use a variation of Gr\"obner bases to study the lattice of ideals of R[x]. Let I be a proper ideal of R[x]. We are interested in the following two questions: When is R[x]/I Frobenius? When is R[x]/I Frobenius and local? We develop algorithms for answering both questions. When the nilpotency of \text{rad}\,R is small, the algorithms provide explicit answers to the questions.
