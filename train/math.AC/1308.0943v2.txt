Using the concept of vector partition functions, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of graded Betti numbers of powers of homogeneous ideals in a polynomial ring over a field. Our main results state that if the polynomial ring is equipped with a positive \ZZ-grading, then the Betti numbers of powers of ideals are encoded by finitely many polynomials.   More precisely, in the case of \ZZ-grading, \ZZ^2 can be splitted into a finite number of regions such that each region corresponds to a polynomial that depending to the degree (\mu, t), \dim_k \left(\tor_i^S(I^t, k)_{\mu} \right) is equal to one of these polynomials in (\mu, t). This refines, in a graded situation, the result of Kodiyalam on Betti numbers of powers of ideals.   Our main statement treats the case of a power products of homogeneous ideals in a \ZZ^d-graded algebra, for a positive grading.
