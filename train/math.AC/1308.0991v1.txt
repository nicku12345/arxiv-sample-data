We fix a field \kk of characteristic p. For a finite group G denote by \delta(G) and \sigma(G) respectively the minimal number d, such that for any finite dimensional representation V of G over \kk and any v\in V^{G}\setminus\{0\} or v\in V\setminus\{0\} respectively, there exists a homogeneous invariant f\in\kk[V]^{G} of positive degree at most d such that f(v)\ne 0. Let P be a Sylow-p-subgroup of G (which we take to be trivial if the group order is not divisble by p). We show that \delta(G)=|P|. If N_{G}(P)/P is cyclic, we show \sigma(G)\ge|N_{G}(P)|. If G is p-nilpotent and P is not normal in G, we show \sigma(G)\le \frac{|G|}{l}, where l is the smallest prime divisor of |G|. These results extend known results in the non-modular case to the modular case.
