We define the notion of componentwise regularity and study some of its basic properties. We prove an analogue, when working with weight orders, of Buchberger's criterion to compute Gr\"obner bases; the proof of our criterion relies on a strengthening of a lifting lemma of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud. This criterion helps us to show a stronger version of Green's crystallization theorem in a quite general setting, according to the componentwise regularity of the initial object. Finally we show a necessary condition, given a submodule M of a free one over the polynomial ring and a weight such that in(M) is componentwise linear, for the existence of an i such that \beta_i(M)=\beta_i(in(M)).
