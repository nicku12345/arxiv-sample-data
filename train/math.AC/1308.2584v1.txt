Let I be an ideal of a Complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring R of dimension n. We wil show that the natural homomorphism Rto HomR(HcI(KR), HcI(KR)) is an isomorphism provided that I is a cohomologically compltete intersection ideal of grade c where KR (resp. HiI(.)) denote the canonical module (resp. i-th local cohomology with respect to the ideal I) of R. The same result is true for the Matlis dual of HcI(KR).
