Let M be a finitely generated ZZ-graded module over the standard graded polynomial ring R=K[X_1, ..., X_n] with K a field, and let H_M(t)=Q_M(t)/(1-t)^d be the Hilbert series of M. We introduce the Hilbert regularity of M as the lowest possible value of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity for an R-module with Hilbert series H_M. Our main result is an arithmetical description of this invariant which connects the Hilbert regularity of M to the smallest k such that the power series Q_M(1-t)/(1-t)^k has no negative coefficients. Finally we give an algorithm for the computation of the Hilbert regularity and the Hilbert depth of an R-module.
