Let (R,\fm) be a relative Cohen-Macaulay local ring with respect to an ideal \fa of R and set c:=\h\fa. In this paper, we investigate some properties of the Matlis dual \H_{\fa}^c(R)^{\vee} of the R-module \H_{\fa}^c(R) and we show that such modules treat like canonical modules over Cohen-Macaulay local rings. Also, we provide some duality and equivalence results with respect to the module \H_{\fa}^c(R)^{\vee} and so these results lead to achieve generalizations of some known results, such as the Local Duality Theorem, which have been provided over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring which admits a canonical module.
