In this paper we define a chain of n-dimensional evolution algebras corresponding to a permutation of n numbers. We show that a chain of evolution algebras (CEA) corresponding to a permutation is trivial (consisting only algebras with zero-multiplication) iff the permutation has not a fixed point. We show that a CEA is a chain of nilpotent algebras (independently on time) iff it is trivial. We construct a wide class of chains of 3-dimensional EAs and a class of symmetric n-dimensional CEAs. A construction of arbitrary dimensional CEAs is given. Moreover, for a chain of 3-dimensional EAs we study the behavior of the baric property, the behavior of the set of absolute nilpotent elements and dynamics of the set of idempotent elements depending on the time.
