We show how several results about p-adic lattices generalize easily to lattices over valuation ring of arbitrary rank having only the Henselian property for quadratic polynomial. If 2 is invertible we obtain the uniqueness of the Jordan decomposition and the Witt Cancelation Theorem. We show that the isomorphism classes of indecomposable rank 2 lattices over such a ring in which 2 is not invertible are characterized by two invariants, provided that the lattices contain a primitive norm divisible by 2 of maximal valuation.
