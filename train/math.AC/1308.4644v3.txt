Let \mathbf{a} = a_1 <\dots < a_r be a sequence of positive integers, and let H_{\mathbf{a}} denote the semigroup generated by a_1, \dots, a_r. For an integer k\geq 0 we denote by \mathbf{a}+k the shifted sequence a_1 +k, \dots, a_r +k. Fix a field K. We show that for all k \gg 0 the associated graded ring of the semigroup ring K[H_{\mathbf{a}+k}] is Cohen--Macaulay and that it has the same Betti numbers as K[H_{\mathbf{a}+k}] itself.   As a consequence, we show that the number of defining equations of the tangent cone of a numerical semigroup ring is bounded by a value depending only on the width of the semigroup, where the width of a numerical semigroup is defined to be the difference of the largest and the smallest element in the minimal generating set of the semigroup. We also provide a conjectured upper bound of the above number of equations and we verify it in some cases.
