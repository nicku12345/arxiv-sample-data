Let S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] be the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K and I\subset S a squarefree monomial ideal. In the present paper we are interested in the monomials u \in S belonging to the socle \Soc(S/I^{k}) of S/I^{k}, i.e., u \not\in I^{k} and ux_{i} \in I^{k} for 1 \leq i \leq n. We prove that if a monomial x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n} belongs to \Soc(S/I^{k}), then a_i\leq k-1 for all 1 \leq i \leq n. We then discuss squarefree monomial ideals I \subset S for which x_{[n]}^{k-1} \in \Soc(S/I^{k}), where x_{[n]} = x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{n}. Furthermore, we give a combinatorial characterization of finite graphs G on [n] = \{1, \ldots, n\} for which \depth S/(I_{G})^{2}=0, where I_{G} is the edge ideal of G.
