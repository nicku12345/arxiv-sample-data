Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, E a non-zero finitely generated R-module and I an ideal of R. One purpose of this paper is to show that the sequences \Ass_RE/ \widetilde{I_E^n} and \Ass_R\widetilde{I^n _E}/\widetilde{I^{n+1}_E}, n = 1,2, \dots, of associated prime ideals are increasing and eventually stabilize. This extends the main result of Mirbagheri and Ratliff \cite[Theorem 3.1]{MR}. In addition, a characterization concerning the set \widetilde{A^*}(I,E) is included. A second purpose of this paper is to prove that I has linear growth primary decompositions for Ratliff-Rush closures with respect to E, that is, there exists a positive integer k such that for every positive integer n, there exists a minimal primary decomposition \widetilde {I^n_E}= Q_1\cap \cdots\cap Q_s in E with (\Rad(Q_i:_RE))^{nk}\subseteq (Q_i:_R E), for all i= 1, \dots, s.
