Let R denote a commutative Noetherian (not necessarily local) ring, M an arbitrary R-module and I an ideal of R of dimension one. It is shown that the R-module \Ext^i_R(R/I,M) is finitely generated (resp. weakly Laskerian) for all i\leq {\rm cd}(I,M)+1 if and only if the local cohomology module H^i_I(M) is I-cofinite (resp. I-weakly cofinite) for all i. Also, we show that when I is an arbitrary ideal and M is finitely generated module such that the R-module H^i_I(M) is weakly Laskerian for all i\leq t-1, then H^i_I(M) is I-cofinite for all i\leq t-1 and for any minimax submodule K of H^{t}_I(M), the R-modules \Hom_R(R/I, H^{t}_I(M)/K) and \Ext^{1}_R(R/I, H^{t}_I(M)/K) are finitely generated, where t is a non-negative integer. This generalizes the main result of Bahmanpour-Naghipour \cite{BN} and Brodmann and Lashgari \cite{BL}.
