Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d and let I be an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal. Let G be the associated graded ring of A \wrt \ I and let \R = A[It,t^{-1}] be the extended Rees ring of A with respect to I. Notice t^{-1} is a non-zero divisor on \R and \R/t^{-1}\R = G. So we have \textit{Bockstein operators} \beta^i \colon H^i_{G_+}(G)(-1) \rt H^{i+1}_{G_+}(G) for i \geq 0. Since \beta^{i+1}(+1)\circ \beta^i = 0 we have \textit{Bockstein cohomology} modules BH^i(G) for i = 0,\ldots,d. In this paper we show that certain natural conditions on I implies vanishing of some Bockstein cohomology modules.
