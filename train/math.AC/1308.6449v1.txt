Let R denote a commutative Noetherian ring, I an ideal of R, and let S be a multiplicatively closed subset of R. In \cite{Ra1}, Ratliff showed that the sequence of sets {\rm Ass}_RR/\bar{I}\subseteq {\rm Ass}_RR/\bar{I^2} \subseteq {\rm Ass}_R R/\bar{I^3}\subseteq \dots  increases and eventually stabilizes to a set denoted \bar{A^\ast}(I). In \cite{Mc2}, S. McAdam gave an interesting description of \bar{A^\ast}(I) by making use of R[It,t^{-1}], the Rees ring of I. In this paper, we give a second description of \bar{A^\ast}(I) by making use of the Rees valuation rings of I. We also reprove a result concerning when \bar{I^n}R_S\cap R=\bar{I^n} for all integers n>0.
