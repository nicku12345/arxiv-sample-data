In the nineties, several methods for dealing in a more efficient way with the implicitization of rational parametrizations were explored in the Computer Aided Geometric Design Community. The analysis of the validity of these techniques has been a fruitful ground for Commutative Algebraists and Algebraic Geometers, and several results have been obtained so far. Yet, a lot of research is still being done currently around this topic. In this note we present these methods, show their mathematical formulation, and survey current results and open questions.
