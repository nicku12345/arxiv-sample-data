In this paper we discuss stable forms of extensions of algebraic local rings along a valuation in all dimensions over a field k of characteristic zero, and generalize a formula of Ghezzi, H\`a and Kashcheyeva describing the extension of associated graded rings along the valuation for stable extensions of regular algebraic local rings of dimension two to arbitrary ground fields k of characteristic zero. We discuss the failure of this result in positive characteristic.
