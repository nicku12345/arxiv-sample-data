In this paper, we continue the study of cominimaxness modules with respect to an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring (cf. \cite{ANV}), and   Bass numbers of local cohomology modules.   Let R denote a commutative Noetherian local ring and I an ideal of R. We first show that the Bass numbers \mu^0(\frak p, H^2_I(R)) and \mu^1(\frak p, H^2_I(R)) are finite for all \frak p\in \Spec R, whenever R is regular. As a consequence, it follows that the Goldie dimension of H^2_I(R) is finite. Also, for a finitely generated R-module M of dimension d, it is shown that the Bass numbers of H^{d-1}_{I}(M) are finite if and only if \Ext^i_R(R/I, H^{d-1}_{I}(M)) be minimax for all i\geq0. Finally, we prove that if \dim R/I=2, then the Bass numbers of H^{n}_{I}(M) are finite if and only if \Ext^i_R(R/I, H^{n}_{I}(M)) be minimax, for all i\geq0, where n is a non-negative integer.
