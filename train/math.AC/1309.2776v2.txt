Let M be an ideal in K[x_1,...,x_n] (K is a field) generated by products of linear forms and containing a homogeneous regular sequence of some length. We prove that ideals containing M satisfy the Eisenbud-Green-Harris conjecture and moreover prove that the Cohen-Macaulay property is preserved. We conclude that monomial ideals satisfy this conjecture. We obtain that h-vector of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex \Delta is the h-vector of Cohen-Macaulay (a_1-1,...,a_t-1)-balanced simplicial complex where t is the height of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of \Delta and (a_1,...,a_t) is the type of some regular sequence contained in this ideal.
