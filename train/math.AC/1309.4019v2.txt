Let R be a Noetherian local ring and I an R-ideal. It is well-known that if the associated graded ring \gr_I(R) is Cohen-Macaulay (Gorenstein), then so is R, but the converse is not true in general. In this paper we investigate the Cohen-Macaulayness and Gorensteinness of the associated graded ring \gr_I(R) under the hypothesis of the extended Rees algebra R[It,t^{-1}] is quasi-Gorenstein or the associated graded ring \gr_I(R) is a domain.
