Given a finitely generated module M over a commutative local ring (or a standard graded k-algebra) (R,\m,k)  we detect its complexity in terms of numerical invariants coming from suitable \m-stable filtrations \mathbb{M} on M. We study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of gr_{\mathbb{M}}(M)  and the linearity defect of M, denoted \ld_R(M), through a deep investigation based on the theory of standard bases. If M is a graded R-module, then \reg_R(gr_{\mathbb{M}}(M)) <\infty implies \reg_R(M)<\infty and the converse holds provided M is of homogenous type. An analogous result can be proved in the local case in terms of the linearity defect. Motivated by a positive answer in the graded case, we present for local rings a partial answer to a question raised by Herzog and Iyengar of whether \ld_R(k)<\infty implies R is Koszul.
