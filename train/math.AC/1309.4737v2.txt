If R is an integral domain and A is an R-algebra, then A has the {\it Laurent cancellation property over R} if A^{[\pm n]}\cong_RB^{[\pm n]} implies A\cong_RB (n\ge 0 and B an R-algebra). Here, A^{[\pm n]} denotes the ring of Laurent polynomials in n variables over A. Our main result (Thm. 4.3) is that, if the transcendence degree of A over R is one, then A has the Laurent cancellation property. The proof uses the characterization of Laurent polynomial rings given in Thm. 3.2.
