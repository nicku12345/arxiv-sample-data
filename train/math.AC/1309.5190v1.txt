Let X be the prime spectrum of a ring. In [arXiv:0707.1525] the authors define a topology on X by using ultrafilters and they show that this topology is precisely the constructible topology. In this paper we generalize the construction given in [arXiv:0707.1525] and, starting from a set X and a collection of subsets \mathcal{F} of X, we define by using ultrafilters a topology on X in which \mathcal F is a collection of clopen sets. We use this construction for giving a new characterization of spectral spaces and several new examples of spectral spaces.
