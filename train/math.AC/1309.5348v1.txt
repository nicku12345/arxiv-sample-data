We study the set of circuits of a homogeneous ideal and that of its truncations, and introduce the notion of generic circuits set. We show how this is a well-defined invariant that can be used, in the case of initial ideals with respect to weights, as a counterpart of the (usual) generic initial ideal with respect to monomial orders. As an application we recover the existence of the generic fan introduced by R\"omer and Schmitz for studying generic tropical varieties. We also consider general initial ideals with respect to weights and show, in analogy to the fact that generic initial ideals are Borel-fixed, that these are fixed under the action of certain Borel subgroups of the general linear group.
