We develop the basic properties of an essentially new closure operation on submodules, the \emph{liftable integral closure} of a submodule, including its relationships with the two prevailing notions of integral closure of submodules. We show that for a quite general class of local rings, every finite length module may be represented as a quotient of the form T/L, where T is torsionless and integrally dependent on L.
