Let R be a local complete intersection ring and let M and N be nonzero finitely generated R-modules. We employ Auslander's transpose in the study of the vanishing of Tor and obtain useful bounds for the depth of the tensor product M\otimes_{R}N. An application of our main argument shows that, if M is locally free on the the punctured spectrum of R, then either \depth(M\otimes_{R}N)\geq \depth(M)+\depth(N)-\depth(R), or \depth(M\otimes_{R}N)\leq \cod(R). Along the way we generalize an important theorem of D. A. Jorgensen and determine the number of consecutive vanishing of \Tor_i^R(M,N) required to ensure the vanishing of all higher \Tor_i^R(M,N).
