Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) denote an n-dimensional Gorenstein ring. For an ideal I \subset R with \grade I = c we define new numerical invariants \tau_{i,j}(I) as the socle dimensions of H^i_{\mathfrak{m}}(H^{n-j}_I(R)). In case of a regular local ring containing a field these numbers coincide with the Lyubeznik numbers \lambda_{i,j}(R/I). We use \tau_{d,d}(I), d = \dim R/I, to characterize the surjectivity of the natural homomorphism f : \hat{R} \to \Hom_{\hat{R}}(H^c_{I\hat{R}}(\hat{R}),H^c_{I\hat{R}}(\hat{R})). As a technical tool we study several natural homomorphisms. Moreover we prove a few results on \tau_{i,j}(I).
