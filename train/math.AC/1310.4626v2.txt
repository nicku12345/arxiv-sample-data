Let K be a field and let R be a regular domain containing K. Let G be a finite subgroup of the group of automorphisms of R. We assume that |G| is invertible in K. Let R^G be the ring of invariants of G. Let I be an ideal in R^G. Fix i \geq 0.   If R^G is Gorenstein then,   \begin{enumerate} \item injdim_{R^G} H^i_I(R^G) \leq \dim \ Supp \ H^i_I(R^G). \item   H^j_{\mathfrak{m}}(H^i_I(R^G)) is injective, where \mathfrak{m} is any maximal ideal of R^G.   \item   \mu_j(P, H^i_I(R^G)) = \mu_j(P^\prime, H^i_{IR}(R)) where P^\prime is any prime in R lying above P. \end{enumerate}   We also prove that if P is a prime ideal in R^G with R^G_P \textit{not Gorenstein} then either the bass numbers \mu_j(P, H^i_I(R^G))  is zero for all j or there exists c such that \mu_j(P, H^i_I(R^G)) = 0  for j < c and \mu_j(P, H^i_I(R^G)) > 0 for all j \geq c.
