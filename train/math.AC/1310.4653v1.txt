In this paper, we study the zero divisor graph \Gamma^m(L) of a multiplicative lattice L. We prove under certain conditions that for a reduced multiplicative lattice L having more than two minimal prime elements, \Gamma^m(L) contains a cycle and gr(\Gamma^m(L)) = 3. This essentially proves that for a reduced ring R with more than two minimal primes, gr(\mathbb{AG}(R))) = 3 which settles the conjecture of Behboodi and Rakeei [9]. Further, we have characterized the diameter of \Gamma^m(L).
