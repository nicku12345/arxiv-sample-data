Let K be a field of characteristic zero, R = K[X_1,\ldots,X_n]. Let A_n(K) = K<X_1,\ldots,X_n, \partial_1, \ldots, \partial_n> be the n^{th} Weyl algebra over K. We consider the case when R and A_n(K) is graded by giving \deg X_i = \omega_i  and \deg \partial_i = -\omega_i for i =1,\ldots,n (here \omega_i are positive integers). Set \omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\omega_k. Let I be a graded ideal in R. By a result due to Lyubeznik the local cohomology modules H^i_I(R) are holonomic A_n(K)-modules for each i \geq 0. In this article we compute the de Rham cohomology modules H^j(\mathbb{\partial}; H^1_{(f)}(R)) for j \leq n-2 when V(f) is a smooth hypersurface in \mathbb{P}^n (equivalently A = R/(f) is an isolated singularity).
