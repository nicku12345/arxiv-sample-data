This Note provides first a generalization of the stabilization result of Eisenbud and Ulrich for the regularity of powers of a m-primary ideal to the case of ideals that are not generated in a single degree. We then partially extend our previous results expressing this stabilization degree in term of the regularity of a specific graded strand of the Rees ring : The natural extension of the statement holds at least if the stabilization index or the regularity is greater than the number of variables. In any case a precise comparison is given.
