Let k be an arbitrary field. In this note, we show that if a sequence of relatively prime positive integers {\bf a}=(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4) defines a Gorenstein non complete intersection monomial curve {\mathcal C}({\bf a}) in {\mathbb A}_k^4, then there exist two vectors {\bf u} and {\bf v} such that {\mathcal C}({\bf a}+t{\bf u}) and {\mathcal C}({\bf a}+t{\bf v}) are also Gorenstein non complete intersection affine monomial curves for almost all t\geq 0.
