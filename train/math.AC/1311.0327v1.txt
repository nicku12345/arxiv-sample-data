In 1983 Kustin and Miller introduced a construction of Gorenstein ideals in local Gorenstein rings, starting from smaller such ideals. We review and modify their construction in the case of graded rings and discuss it within the framework of Gorenstein liaison theory. We determine invariants of the constructed ideal. Concerning the problem of when a given Gorenstein ideal can be obtained by the construction, we derive a necessary condition and exhibit a Gorenstein ideal that can not be obtained using the construction.
