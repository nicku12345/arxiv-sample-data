We give several new applications of our theorem on the existence of multiplicity of graded families of ideals as a limit, including a very general Minkowski type inequality for graded families of ideals, a very general formula for existence of local volumes as a limit and a very general theorem on the existence of epsilon multiplicities as a limit for modules.
