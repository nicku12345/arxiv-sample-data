An exposition on Spivakovsky's dual graphs of valuations on function fields of dimension two is first given, leading to a proof of minimal generating sequences for the non-divisorial valuations. It should be noted that the definition of generating sequence used in this paper is different from Spivakovsky's original usage. This change leads to an explicit formulation of generating sequence values for the non-divisorial cases in terms of data from their dual graphs. The proofs are elementary in the sense that only continued fractions and the linear Diophantine Frobenius problem from classical number theory are used.
