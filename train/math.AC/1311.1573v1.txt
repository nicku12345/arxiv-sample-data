For a Noetherian local ring (R,{\mathfrak m}) with \mathfrak p\in \Spec(R) we denote E_R(R/\mathfrak p) by the R-injective hull of R/\mathfrak p. We will show that it has an \hat{R}^\mathfrak p-module structure and there is an isomorphism E_R(R/\mathfrak p)\cong E_{\hat{R}^\mathfrak p}(\hat{R}^\mathfrak p/\mathfrak p\hat{R}^\mathfrak p) where \hat{R}^\mathfrak p stands for the \mathfrak p-adic completion of R. Moreover for a complete Cohen-Macaulay ring R the module D(E_R(R/\mathfrak p)) is isomorphic to \hat{R}_\mathfrak{p} provided that \dim(R/\mathfrak p)=1 and D(\cdot) denotes the Matlis dual functor \Hom_R(\cdot, E_R(R/\mathfrak m)). Here \hat{R}_\mathfrak{p} denotes the completion of {R_\mathfrak p} with respect to the maximal ideal \mathfrak pR_\mathfrak p. These results extend those of Matlis (see \cite{m}) shown in the case of the maximal ideal {\mathfrak m}.
