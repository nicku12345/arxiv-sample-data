Let S_1 and S_2 be two affine semigroups and let S be the gluing of S_1 and S_2. Several invariants of S are then related to those of S_1 and S_2; we review some of the most important properties preserved under gluings. The aim of this paper is to prove that this is the case for the Frobenius vector and the Hilbert series. Applications to complete intersection affine semigroups are also given.
