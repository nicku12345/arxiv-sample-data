Let R be a standard graded algebra over a field k. We prove an Auslander-Buchsbaum formula for the absolute Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, extending important cases of previous works of Chardin and R\"omer. For a bounded complex of finitely generated graded R-modules L, we prove the equality \text{reg}~ L=\max_{i\in \mathbb Z} \{\text{reg}~ H_i(L)-i\} given the condition \text{depth}~ H_i(L)\ge \dim H_{i+1}(L)-1 for all i<\sup L. As applications, we recover previous bounds on regularity of Tor due to Caviglia, Eisenbud-Huneke-Ulrich, among others. We also obtain strengthened results on regularity bounds for Ext and for the quotient by a linear form of a module.
