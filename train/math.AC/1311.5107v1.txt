Let D be a principal ideal domain and R(D) = \{\begin{pmatrix} a & b 0 & a \end{pmatrix} \mid a, b \in D\} be its self-idealization. It is known that R(D) is a commutative noetherian ring with identity, and hence R(D) is atomic (i.e., every nonzero nonunit can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements). In this paper, we completely characterize the irreducible elements of R(D). We then use this result to show how to factorize each nonzero nonunit of R(D) into irreducible elements. We show that every irreducible element of R(D) is a primary element, and we determine the system of sets of lengths of R(D).
