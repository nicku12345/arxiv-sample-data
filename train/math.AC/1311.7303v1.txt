Let K be a field and I a monomial ideal of the polynomial ring S=K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]. We show that if either: 1) I is almost complete intersection, 2) I can be generated by less than four monomials; or 3) I is the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a locally complete intersection simplicial complex on [n], then Stanley's conjecture holds for S/I.
