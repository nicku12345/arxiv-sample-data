A square-free monomial ideal I is called an {\it f-ideal}, if both \delta_{\mathcal{F}}(I) and \delta_{\mathcal{N}}(I) have the same f-vector, where \delta_{\mathcal{F}}(I) (\delta_{\mathcal{N}}(I), respectively) is the facet (Stanley-Reisner, respectively) complex related to I. In this paper, we introduce and study perfect subsets of 2^{[n]} and use them to characterize the f-ideals of degree d. We give a decomposition of V(n, 2) by taking advantage of a correspondence between graphs and sets of square-free monomials of degree 2, and then give a formula for counting the number of f-ideals of degree 2, where V(n, 2) is the set of f-ideals of degree 2 in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]. We also consider the relation between an f-ideal and an unmixed monomial ideal.
