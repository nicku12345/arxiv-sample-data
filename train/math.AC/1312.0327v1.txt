In this paper, we show for a monomial ideal I of K[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n] that the integral closure \ol{I} is a monomial ideal of Borel type (Borel-fixed, strongly stable, lexsegment, or universal lexsegment respectively), if I has the same property. We also show that the k^{th} symbolic power I^{(k)} of I preserves the properties of Borel type, Borel-fixed and strongly stable, and I^{(k)} is lexsegment if I is stably lexsegment. For a monomial ideal I and a monomial prime ideal P, a new ideal J(I, P) is studied, which also gives a clear description of the primary decomposition of I^{(k)}. Then a new simplicial complex _J\bigtriangleup of a monomial ideal J is defined, and it is shown that I_{_J\bigtriangleup^{\vee}} = \sqrt{J}. Finally, we show under an additional weak assumption that a monomial ideal is universal lexsegment if and only if its polarization is a squarefree strongly stable ideal.
