Let I\supsetneq J be two squarefree monomial ideals of a polynomial algebra over a field generated in degree \geq d, resp. \geq d+1 . Suppose that I is either generated by four squarefree monomials of degrees d and others of degrees \geq d+1, or by five special monomials of degrees d. If the Stanley depth of I/J is \leq d+1 then the usual depth of I/J is \leq d+1 too.
