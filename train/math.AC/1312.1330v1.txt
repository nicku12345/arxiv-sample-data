Let \frak a denote an ideal in a commutative Noetherian ring R and M a finitely generated R-module. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the cohomological dimension filtration \mathscr{M} =\{M_i\}_{i=0}^c, where  c={\rm cd} ({\frak a},M) and M_i denotes the largest submodule of M such that {\rm cd} ({\frak a}, M_i)\leq i. Some properties of this filtration are investigated. In particular, in the case that (R, \frak m) is local and c= \dim M, we are able to determine the annihilator of the top local cohomology module H_{\frak a}^c(M). In fact, it is shown that {\rm Ann}_R(H_{\frak a}^c(M))= {\rm Ann}_R(M/M_{c-1}). As a consequence, it follows that there exists an ideal \frak b of R such that {\rm Ann}_R(H_{\frak a}^{c}(M))={\rm Ann}_R(M/H_{\frak b}^{0}(M)).
