We show that the graded maximal ideal of a graded K-algebra R has linear quotients for a suitable choice and order of its generators if the defining ideal of R has a quadratic Gr\"obner basis with respect to the reverse lexicographic order, and show that this linear quotient property for algebras defined by binomial edge ideals characterizes closed graphs. Furthermore, for algebras defined by binomial edge ideals attached to a closed graph and for join-meet rings attached to a finite distributive lattice we present explicit Koszul filtrations.
