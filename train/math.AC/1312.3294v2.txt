We study the module C^r(\mathcal{P}) of piecewise polynomial functions of smoothness r on a pure n-dimensional polytopal complex \mathcal{P}\subset\mathbb{R}^n, via an analysis of certain subcomplexes \mathcal{P}_W obtained from the intersection lattice of the interior codimension one faces of \mathcal{P}. We obtain two main results: first, we show that in sufficiently high degree, the vector space C^r_k(\mathcal{P}) of splines of degree \leq k has a basis consisting of splines supported on the \mathcal{P}_W for k\gg0. We call such splines lattice-supported. This shows that an analog of the notion of a star-supported basis for C^r_k(\Delta) studied by Alfeld-Schumaker in the simplicial case holds. Second, we provide a pair of conjectures, one involving lattice-supported splines, bounding how large k must be so that \mbox{dim}_\mathbb{R} C^r_k(\mathcal{P}) agrees with the formula given by McDonald-Schenck. A family of examples shows that the latter conjecture is tight. The proposed bounds generalize known and conjectured bounds in the simplicial case.
