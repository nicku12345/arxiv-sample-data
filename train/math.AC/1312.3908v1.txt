Let I denote an ideal in a commutative Noetherian ring R. Let M be an R-module. The I-adic completion is defined by \hat{M}^I = \varprojlim{}_{\alpha} M/I^{\alpha}M. Then M is called I-adic complete whenever the natural homomorphism M \to \hat{M}^I is an isomorphism. Let M be I-separated, i.e. \cap_{\alpha} I^{\alpha}M = 0. In the main result of the paper it is shown that M is I-adic complete if and only if \Ext_R^1(F,M) = 0 for the flat test module F = \oplus_{i = 1}^r R_{x_i} where \{x_1,\ldots,x_r\} is a system of elements such that \Rad I = \Rad \xx R. This result extends several known statements starting with C. U. Jensen's result (see \cite[Proposition 3]{J}) that a finitely generated R-module M over a local ring R is complete if and only if \Ext^1_R(F,M) = 0 for any flat R-module F.
