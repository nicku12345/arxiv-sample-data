Let k be an uncountable field. We prove that the polynomial ring R:=k[X_1,\dots,X_n] in n\ge 2 variables over k is complete in its adic topology. In addition we prove that also the localization R_{\goth m} at a maximal ideal \goth m\subset R is adically complete. The first result settles an old conjecture of C. U. Jensen, the second a conjecture of L. Gruson. Our proofs are based on a result of Gruson stating (in two variables) that R_{\goth m} is adically complete when R=k[X_1,X_2] and \goth m=(X_1,X_2).
