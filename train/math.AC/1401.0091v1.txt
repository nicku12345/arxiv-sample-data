Recently there has been a flurry of research on generalized factorization techniques in both integral domains and rings with zero-divisors, namely \tau-factorization. There are several ways that authors have studied factorization in rings with zero-divisors. This paper focuses on the method of regular factorizations introduced by D.D. Anderson and S. Valdes-Leon. We investigate how one can extend the notion of \tau-factorization to commutative rings with zero-divisors by using the regular factorization approach. The study of regular factorization is particularly effective because the distinct notions of associate and irreducible coincide for regular elements. We also note that the popular U-factorization developed by C.R. Fletcher also coincides since every regular divisor is essential. This will greatly simplify many of the cumbersome finite factorization definitions that exist in the literature when studying factorization in rings with zero-divisors.
