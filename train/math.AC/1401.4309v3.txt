Let K be a field, R=K[X_1, ..., X_n] be the polynomial ring and J \subsetneq I two monomial ideals in R. In this paper we show that \mathrm{sdepth}\ {I/J} - \mathrm{depth}\ {I/J} = \mathrm{sdepth}\ {I^p/J^p}-\mathrm{depth}\ {I^p/J^p}, where \mathrm{sdepth}\ I/J denotes the Stanley depth and I^p denotes the polarization. This solves a conjecture by Herzog and reduces the famous Stanley conjecture (for modules of the form I/J) to the squarefree case. As a consequence, the Stanley conjecture for algebras of the form R/I and the well-known combinatorial conjecture that every Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex is partitionable are equivalent.
