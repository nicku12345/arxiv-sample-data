Our purpose is to study the cohomological properties of the Rees algebras of a class of ideals generated by quadrics. For all such ideals I\subset R = K[x,y,z] we give the precise value of depth R[It] and decide whether the corresponding rational maps are birational. In the case of dimension d \geq 3, when K=\mathbb{R}, we give structure theorems for all ideals of codimension d minimally generated by {{d+1}\choose{2}}-1 quadrics. For arbitrary fields K, we prove a polarized version.
