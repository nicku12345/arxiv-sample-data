Motivated by work of Hochster and Huneke, we investigate several constructions related to the S_2-ification T of a complete equidimensional local ring R: the canonical module, the top local cohomology module, topological spaces of the form \operatorname{Spec}(R)-V(J), and the (finite simple) graph \Gamma_R with vertex set \operatorname{Min}(R) defined by Hochster and Huneke. We generalize one of their results by showing, e.g., that the number of maximal ideals of T is equal to the number of connected components of \Gamma_R. We further investigate this graph by exhibiting a technique for showing that a given graph G can be realized as one of the form \Gamma_R.
