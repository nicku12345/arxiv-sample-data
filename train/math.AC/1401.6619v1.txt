Let R be a commutative ring with non-zero identity. We describe all C_3- and C_4-free intersection graph of non-trivial ideals of R as well as C_n-free intersection graph when R is a reduced ring. Also, we shall describe all complete, regular and n-claw-free intersection graphs. Finally, we shall prove that almost all Artin rings R have Hamiltonian intersection graphs. We show that such graphs are indeed pancyclic.
