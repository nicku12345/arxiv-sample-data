Let X be a chain complex over a commutative noetherian ring R, that is, an object in the derived category \mathcal{D}(R). We investigate the small support and co-support of X, introduced by Foxby and Benson, Iyengar, and Krause. We show that the derived functors M \otimes_R^{\mathbf{L}} - and \mathbf{R}\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-) can detect isomorphisms in \mathcal{D}(R) between complexes with restrictions on their supports or co-supports. In particular, the derived local (co)homology functors \mathbf{R}\Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}}(-) and \mathbf{L}\Lambda_{\mathfrak{a}}(-) with respect to an ideal \mathfrak{a}\subsetneq R have the same ability. Furthermore, we give reprove some results of Benson, Iyengar, and Krause in our setting, with more direct proofs. Also, we include some computations of co-supports, since this construction is still quite mysterious. Lastly, we investigate "\mathfrak{a}-adically finite" R-complexes, that is, the X\in\mathcal{D}(R) that are \mathfrak{a}-cofinite \textit{\`a la} Hartshorne. For instance, we characterize these complexes in terms of a finiteness condition on \mathbf{L}\Lambda_{\mathfrak{a}}(X).
