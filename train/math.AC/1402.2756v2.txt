Let (S, \mathfrak n)  be a regular local ring and let I \subseteq \mathfrak n^2  be a perfect ideal of S.  Sharp upper bounds on the minimal number of generators of I are known in terms of the Hilbert function of R=S/I.  Starting from information on the ideal I,  for instance the minimal number of generators, a difficult task is to find good bounds on the minimal number of generators of the leading ideal I^* , which defines the tangent cone of R or to give information on its graded structure. Motivated by papers of S.C. Kothari, S. Goto {\it{et al.}} concerning the leading ideal of a complete intersection I=(f,g)  in a regular local ring, we present results provided ht(I)=2. If I is a complete intersection, we prove that the Hilbert function of R determines the graded Betti numbers of the leading ideal and, as a consequence, we recover most of the results of the previously quoted papers. The description is more complicated if \nu(I) >2 and a careful investigation can be provided when \nu(I)=3.  Several examples illustrating our results are given.
