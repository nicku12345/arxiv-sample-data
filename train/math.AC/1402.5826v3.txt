In this paper we show that the depth and the Stanley depth of the factor of two monomial ideals is invariant under taking a so called canonical form. It follows easily that the Stanley Conjecture holds for the factor if and only if it holds for its canonical form. In particular, we construct an algorithm which simplifies the depth computation and using the canonical form we massively reduce the run time for the sdepth computation.
