We study Archimedean and locally Archimedean stable domains.   We prove that a domain is stable and one-dimensional if and only if it is finitely stable and Mori. But we give examples of Archimedean stable local domains that are not one-dimensional. We also prove that a locally Archimedean stable domain satisfies accp and that Archimedean stable semilocal domains are locally Archimedean. But generally, neither Archimedean stable domains, nor Archimedean semilocal domains are necessarily locally Archimedean.
