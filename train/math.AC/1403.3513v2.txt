We consider classes of ideals which generalize the mixed product ideals introduced by Restuccia and Villarreal, and also generalize the expansion construction by Bayati and the first author \cite{BH}. We compute the minimal graded free resolution of generalized mixed product ideals and show that the regularity of a generalized mixed product ideal coincides with regularity of the monomial ideal by which it is induced.
