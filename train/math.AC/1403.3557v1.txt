We present here an overview of the hypermatrix spectral decomposition deduced from the Bhattacharya-Mesner hypermatrix algebra. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a spectral decomposition. We further extend to hypermatrices the notion of resolution of identity and use them to derive hypermatrix analog of matrix spectral bounds. Finally we describe an algorithm for computing generators of the spectral elimination ideals which considerably improves on Groebner basis computation suggested in.
