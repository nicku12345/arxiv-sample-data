Algebraic power series are formal power series which satisfy a univariate polynomial equation over the polynomial ring in n variables. This relation determines the series only up to conjugacy. Via the Artin-Mazur theorem and the implicit function theorem it is possible to describe algebraic series completely by a vector of polynomials in n+p variables. This vector will be the code of the series. In the paper, it is then shown how to manipulate algebraic series through their code. In particular, the Weierstrass division and the Grauert-Hironaka-Galligo division will be performed on the level of codes, thus providing a finite algorithm to compute the quotients and the remainder of the division.
