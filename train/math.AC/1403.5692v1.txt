In a recent preprint, Ilse Fischer and Martina Kubitzke, proved the bilinearity of the Segre transform under some restricted hypothesis, motivated by their results we show in this paper the bilinearity of the Segre transform in general. We apply these results to compute the postulation number of a series. Our second application is motivated by the paper of David A. Cox, and Evgeny Materov (2009), where is computed the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the Segre Veronese embedding, we can extend partially their result and compute the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the Segre product of Cohen-Macaulay modules.
