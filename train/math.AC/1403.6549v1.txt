We study transformations of finite modules over Noetherian local rings that attach to a module M a graded module H^{0}_{\mathfrak{m}}( \mathrm{gr}_{I}(M)) defined via partial systems of parameters of M. Despite the generality of the process, which are called \mathbf{j}-transforms, in numerous cases they have interesting cohomological properties. We focus on deriving the Hilbert functions of \mathbf{j}-transforms and studying the significance of the vanishing of some of its coefficients.
