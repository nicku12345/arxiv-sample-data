Let G be a subgroup of the automorphism group of a commutative ring with identity T. Let R be a subring of T such that R is invariant under the action by G. We show R^G\subset T^G is a minimal ring extension whenever R\subset T is a minimal extension under various assumptions. Of the two types of minimal ring extensions, integral and integrally closed, both of these properties are passed from R\subset T to R^G\subset T^G. An integrally closed minimal ring extension is a flat epimorphic extension as well as a normal pair. We show each of these properties also pass from R\subset T to R^G\subseteq T^G under certain group action.
