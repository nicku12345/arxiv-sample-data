Let (R,\m) be a Noetherian local ring and M a finitely generated R-module. Following I. G. Macdonald \cite{Mac}, the set of all attached primes of the Artinian local cohomology module H^i_{\m}(M) is denoted by \Att_R(H^i_{\m}(M)). In \cite[Theorem 3.7]{Sh}, R. Y. Sharp proved that if R is a quotient of a Gorenstein local ring then the shifted localization principle always holds true, i.e.  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \Att_{R_{\p}}\big(H^{i-\dim (R/\p)}_{\p R_{\p}}(M_{\p})\big)=\big\{\q R_{\p}\mid \q\in\Att_RH^i_{\m}(M), \q\subseteq \p\big\} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1) for any local cohomology modules H^i_{\m}(M) and any \p\in\Spec (R). In this paper, we improve Sharp's result as follows: the shifted localization principle always holds true if and only if R is universally catenary and all its formal fibers are Cohen-Macaulay, if and only if \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \displaystyle \Att_{\R}(H^i_{\m}(M))=\bigcup_{\p\in\Att_R(H^i_{\m}(M))}\Ass_{\R}(\R/\p\R)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2) holds true for any finitely generated R-module M and any integer i\geq 0. This also improves the main result of the paper \cite{CN}.
