In the first section of this paper, we introduce the notions of fractional and invertible ideals of semirings and characterize invertible ideals of a semidomain. In section two, we define Pr\"{u}fer semirings and characterize them in terms of valuation semirings. In this section, we also characterize Pr\"{u}fer semirings in terms of some identities over its ideals such as (I + J)(I \cap J) = IJ for all ideals I, J of S. In the third section, we give a semiring version for the Gilmer-Tsang Theorem, which states that for a suitable family of semirings, the concepts of Pr\"{u}fer and Gaussian semirings are equivalent. At last we end this paper by giving a plenty of examples of proper Gaussian and Pr\"{u}fer semirings.
