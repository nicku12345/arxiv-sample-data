Let M be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian local ring. This paper reports, for a given parameter ideal Q for M, a criterion for the equality \chi_1(Q;M)=\operatorname{hdeg}_Q(M)-\mathrm{e}_Q^0(M), where \chi_1(Q;M), \operatorname{hdeg}_Q(M), and \mathrm{e}_Q^0(M) respectively denote the first Euler characteristic, the homological degree, and the multiplicity of M with respect to Q. We also study homological torsions of M and give a criterion for a certain equality of the first Hilbert coefficients of parameters and the homological torsions of M.
