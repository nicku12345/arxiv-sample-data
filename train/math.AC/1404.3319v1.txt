Let R* be an ideal-adic completion of a Noetherian integral domain R and let L be a subfield of the total quotient ring of R* such that L contains R. Let A denote the intersection of L with R*. The integral domain A sometimes inherits nice properties from R* such as the Noetherian property. For certain fields L it is possible to approximate A using a localzation B of a nested union of polynomial rings over R associated to A; if B is Noetherian, then B = A. If B is not Noetherian, we can sometimes identify the prime ideals of B that are not finitely generated. We have obtained in this way, for each positive integer s, a 3-dimensional local unique factorization domain B such that the maximal ideal of B is 2-generated, B has precisely s prime ideals of height 2, each prime ideal of B of height 2 is not finitely generated and all the other prime ideals of B are finitely generated. We examine the map Spec A to Spec B for this example. We also present a generalization of this example to dimension 4. We describe a 4-dimensional local non-Noetherian UFD B such that the maximal ideal of B is 3-generated, there exists precisely one prime ideal Q of B of height 3, the prime ideal Q is not finitely generated. We consider the question of whether Q is the only prime ideal of B that is not finitely generated, but have not answered this question.
