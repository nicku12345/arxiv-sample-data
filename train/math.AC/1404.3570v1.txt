We consider properties and applications of a new topology, called the Zariski topology, on the space {\rm SStar}(A) of all the semistar operations on an integral domain A. We prove that the set of all overrings of A, endowed with the classical Zariski topology, is homeomorphic to a subspace of {\rm SStar}(A). The topology on {\rm SStar}(A) provides a general theory, through which we see several algebraic properties of semistar operation as very particular cases of our construction. Moreover, we show that the subspace {\rm SStar}_f(A) of all the semistar operations of finite type on A is a spectral space.
