Let f : A \rightarrow B be a ring homomorphism and J be an ideal of B. In this paper, we give a characterization of zero divisors of the amalgamation which is a generalization of Maimani's and Yassemi's work (see \cite{y}). Also, we investigate the transfer of Pr\"ufer domain concept to commutative rings with zero divisors in the amalgamation of A with B along J with respect to f (denoted by A\bowtie^fJ), introduced and studied by D'Anna, Finocchiaro and Fontana in 2009 (see \cite{AFF1} and \cite{AFF2}). Our aim is to provide new classes of commutative rings satisfying this property.
