Let f: A\rightarrow B be a ring homomorphism and let J be an ideal of B. In this paper, we investigate the transfer of self-injective property to the amalgamation of A with B along J with respect to f (denoted by A\bowtie^fJ), introduced and studied by D'Anna, Finocchiaro and Fontana in 2009. We give also a characterization of A\bowtie^fJ to be quasi-Frobenius.
