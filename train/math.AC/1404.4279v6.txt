In this note, we consider a situation that is generally used as an intermediate technical step in proving the Artin-Rees lemma but otherwise is not much discussed in introductory accounts of commutative algebra. I hope to show in this note that such technical step deserves more recognition and emphasis in any introduction to commutative algebra because it can be used to prove some significant results in a straight-forward manner, including a generalization of a theorem by Pierre Cartier and John Tate.
