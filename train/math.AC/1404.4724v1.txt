We find the minimal free resolution of the ideal of a star-configuration in \mathbb{P}^n of type (r,s) defined by general forms in R=\Bbbk[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n]. This generalises the results of \cite{AS:1,GHM} from a specific value of r=2 to any value of 1\le r\le n. Moreover, we show that any star-configuration in \mathbb{P}^n is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. As an application, we construct a few of graded Artinian rings, which have the weak Lefschetz property, using the sum of two ideals of star-configurations in \mathbb{P}^n.
