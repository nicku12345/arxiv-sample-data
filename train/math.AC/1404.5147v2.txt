The purpose of this article is to prove some results on the Witt vectors of perfect \mathbf{F}_p-algebras. Let A be a perfect \mathbf{F}_p-algebra for a prime integer p and assume that A has the property \mathbf{P}. Then does the ring of Witt vectors of A also have \mathbf{P}? A main theorem gives an affirmative answer for \mathbf{P}="\mbox{integrally closed}" under a very mild condition.
