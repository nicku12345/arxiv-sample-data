Let A\subseteq B be a commutative ring extension. Let \mathcal I(A, B) be the multiplicative group of invertible A-submodules of B. In this article, we extend a result of Sadhu and Singh by finding a necessary and sufficient condition on an integral birational extension A\subseteq B of integral domains with \dim A\leq 1, so that the natural map \mathcal I(A,B) \rightarrow \mathcal I (A [X, X^{-1}],B [X, X^{-1}]) is an isomorphism. In the same situation, we show that if \dim A\geq 2 then the condition is necessary but not sufficient. We also discuss some properties of the cokernel of the natural map \mathcal I(A,B) \rightarrow \mathcal I (A [X, X^{-1}],B [X, X^{-1}]) in the general case.
