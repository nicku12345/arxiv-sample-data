Let X be the Hankel matrix of size 2\times n and let G be a closed graph on the vertex set [n]. We study the binomial ideal I_G\subset K[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}] which is generated by all the 2-minors of X which correspond to the edges of G. We show that I_G is Cohen-Macaulay. We find the minimal primes of I_G and show that I_G is a set theoretical complete intersection. Moreover, a sharp upper bound for the regularity of I_G is given.
