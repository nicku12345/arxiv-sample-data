The subject matter is the structure of the Rees algebra of almost complete intersection ideals of finite colength in low-dimensional polynomial rings over fields. The main tool is a mix of Sylvester forms and iterative mapping cone construction. The material developed spins around ideals of forms in two or three variables in the search of those classes for which the corresponding Rees ideal is generated by Sylvester forms and is almost Cohen--Macaulay. A main offshoot is in the case where the forms are monomials. Another consequence is a proof that the Rees ideals of the base ideals of certain plane Cremona maps (e.g., de Jonqui\`eres maps) are generated by Sylvester forms and are almost Cohen--Macaulay.
