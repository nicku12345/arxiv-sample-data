Let I denote an ideal of a local ring (R,\mathfrak{m}) of dimension n. Let M denote a finitely generated R-module. We study the endomorphism ring of the local cohomology module H^c_I(M), c = \grade (I,M). In particular there is a natural homomorphism \Hom_{\hat{R}^I}(\hat{M}^I, \hat{M}^I)\to \Hom_{R}(H^c_{I}(M),H^c_{I}(M)), where \hat{\cdot}^I denotes the I-adic completion functor. We prove sufficient conditions such that it becomes an isomorphism. Moreover, we study a homomorphism of two such endomorphism rings of local cohomology modules for two ideals J \subset I with the property \grade(I,M) = \grade(J,M). Our results extends constructions known in the case of M = R (see e.g. \cite{h1}, \cite{p7}, \cite{p1}).
