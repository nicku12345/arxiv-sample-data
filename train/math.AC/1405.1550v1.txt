Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension 2, I and J \mathfrak{m}-primary ideals in R and (a,b) a joint reduction of (I,J). In this paper we consider the problem whether [H^2_{(at_1,bt_2)}(\mathcal R^\prime)]_{(r,s)} has finite length as an R-module, where \mathcal R^\prime denotes the bigraded extended Rees algebra of I and J. We give an example to show that the answer is negative in general. For all r,s \geq 0,  we give equivalent conditions for [H^2_{(at_1,bt_2)}(\mathcal R^\prime)]_{(r,s)} to have finite length in terms of the first Bhattacharya coefficients e_{(1,0)} and e_{(0,1)} and the first Hilbert coefficient e_1(I) and e_1(J). Here (a,b) is a joint reduction of (I,J) satisfying superficial conditions. As a consequence we prove that [H^2_{(at_1,bt_2)}(\mathcal R^\prime)]_{(0,0)} has finite length if and only if e_{(1,0)}= e_1(I) and e_{(0,1)}=e_1(J). We give necessary and sufficient conditions for vanishing of [H^2_{(at_1,bt_2)}(\mathcal{R}^\prime)]_{(r,s)} in terms of Bhattacharya coefficients and Hilbert coefficients.
