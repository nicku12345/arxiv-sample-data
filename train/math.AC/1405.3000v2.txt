The content of a polynomial over a ring R is a well understood notion. Ohm and Rush generalized this concept of a content map to an arbitrary ring extension of R, although it can behave quite badly. We examine five properties an algebra may have with respect to this function -- content algebra, weak content algebra, semicontent algebra (our own definition), Gaussian algebra, and Ohm-Rush algebra. We show that the Gaussian, weak content, and semicontent algebra properties are all transitive. However, transitivity is unknown for the content algebra property. We then compare the Ohm-Rush notion with the more usual notion of content in the power series context. We show that many of the given properties coincide for the power series extension map over a valuation ring of finite dimension, and that they are equivalent to the value group being order-isomorphic to the integers or the reals. Along the way, we give a new characterization of Pr\"ufer domains.
