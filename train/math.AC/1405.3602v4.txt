In this paper we show that the Stanley depth, as well as the usual depth, are essentially determined by the lcm-lattice. More precisely, we show that for quotients I/J of monomial ideals J\subset I, both invariants behave monotonic with respect to certain maps defined on their lcm-lattice. This allows simple and uniform proofs of many new and known results on the Stanley depth. In particular, we obtain a generalization of our result on polarization presented in the reference [IKMF14]. We also obtain a useful description of the class of all monomial ideals with a given lcm-lattice, which is independent from our applications to the Stanley depth.
