Let M be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian local ring. This paper gives, for a given parameter ideal Q for M, bounds for the second Hilbert coefficients {\mathrm{e}}_Q^2(M) in terms of the homological degrees and torsions of modules. We also report a criterion for a certain equality of the second Hilbert coefficients of parameters and the homological torsions of modules.
