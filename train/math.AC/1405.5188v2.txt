We obtain various characterizations of commutative Noetherian local rings (R, \fm) in terms of homological dimensions of certain finitely generated modules. For example, we establish that R is Gorenstein if the Gorenstein injective dimension of the maximal ideal \fm of R is finite. Furthermore we prove that R must be regular if a single \Ext_{R}^{n}(I,J) vanishes for some integrally closed \fm-primary ideals I and J of R and for some integer n\geq \dim(R). Along the way we observe that local rings that admit maximal Cohen-Macaulay Tor-rigid modules are Cohen-Macaulay.
