Let (R, \frak m) be a Noetherian local ring and M a finitely generated R-module of dimension d. Let \underline{x} = x_1, ..., x_d be a system of parameters of M and \underline{n} = (n_1, ..., n_d) a d-tuple of positive integers. In this paper we study the length of generalized fractions M (1/(x_1, ..., x_d, 1)) which was introduced by Sharp and Hamieh in \cite{ShH85}. First, we study the growth of the function J_{\underline{x}, M}(\underline{n}) = \ell(M (1/(x_1^{n_1}, ..., x_d^{n_d}, 1))) - n_1...n_d e(\underline{x};M). Then we give an explicit calculation for the function J_{\underline{x}, M}(\underline{n}) in the case where M admits a Macaulayfication. Most previous results on this topic are now easy to understand and to improve.
