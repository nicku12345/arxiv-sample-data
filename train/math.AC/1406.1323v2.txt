Let R denote a commutative Noetherian ring. Brodmann et al. defined and studied the concept of the local-global principle for annihilation of local cohomology modules at level r\in\mathbb{N} for the ideals \frak a and \frak b of R. It was shown that this principle holds at levels 1,2, over R and at all levels whenever \dim R\leq 4. The goal of this paper is to show that, if the set \Ass_R(H_{\fa}^{f_{\fa}^{\fb}(M)}(M)) is finite or f_{\fa}(M)\neq c_{\fa}^{\fb}(M), then the local-global principle holds at all levels r\in\mathbb{N}_0, for all ideals \fa, \fb of R and each finitely generated R-module M, where c_{\fa}^{\fb}(M) denotes the first non \fb-cofiniteness of local cohomology module H^i_{\fa}(M). As a consequence of this, we provide a new and short proof of the Faltings' local-global principle for finiteness dimensions. Also, several new results concerning the finiteness dimensions are given.
