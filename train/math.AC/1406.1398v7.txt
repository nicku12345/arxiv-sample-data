Let I be a squarefree monomial ideal of a polynomial algebra over a field minimally generated by f_1,...,f_r of degree  d\geq 1, and a set E of monomials of degree \geq d+1. Let J\subsetneq I be a squarefree monomial ideal generated in degree \geq d+1. Suppose that all squarefree monomials of I\setminus (J\cup E) of degree d+1 are some least common multiples of f_i. If J contains all least common multiples of two of (f_i) of degree d+2 then \depth_SI/J\leq d+1 and Stanley's Conjecture holds for I/J.
