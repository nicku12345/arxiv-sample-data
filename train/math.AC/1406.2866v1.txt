Let (R,m) be a local Noetherian ring, let M be a finitely generated R-module and let (F_{\bullet},\partial_{\bullet}) be a free resolution of M. We find a uniform bound h such that the Artin-Rees containment I^n F_i\cap Im \, \partial_{i+1} \subseteq I^{n-h} Im \, \partial_{i+1} holds for all integers i\ge d, for all integers n\ge h, and for all ideals I of R. In fact, we show that a considerably stronger statement holds. The uniform bound h holds for all ideals and all resolutions of dth syzygy modules. In order to prove our statements, we introduce the concept of Koszul annihilating sequences.
