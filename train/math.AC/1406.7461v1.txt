Let M be a non-zero finitely generated module over a finite dimensional commutative Noetherian local ring (R,\mathfrak{m}) with dim_R(M)=t. Let I be an ideal of R with grade(I,M)=c. In this article we will investigate several natural homomorphisms of local cohomology modules. The main purpose of this article is to investigate that the natural homomorphisms Tor^R_c(k,H^c_I(M))\to k\otimes_R M and Ext^{d}_R(k,H^c_I(M))\to {\rm Ext}^t_R(k, M) are non-zero where d:=t-c. In fact for a Cohen-Macaulay module M we will show that the homomorphism Ext^d_R(k,H^c_I(M))\to {\rm Ext}^t_R(k, M) is injective (resp. surjective) if and only if the homomorphism H^{d}_{\mathfrak{m}}(H^c_{I}(M))\to H^t_{\mathfrak{m}}(M) is injective (resp. surjective) under the additional assumption of vanishing of Ext modules. The similar results are obtained for the homomorphism Tor^R_c(k,H^c_I(M))\to k\otimes_R M. Moreover we will construct the natural homomorphism {\rm Tor}^R_c(k, H^c_I(M))\to {\rm Tor}^R_c(k, H^c_J(M)) for the ideals J\subseteq I with c = {\rm grade}(I,M)= {\rm grade}(J,M). There are several sufficient conditions on I and J to prove this homomorphism is an isomorphism.
