Let I be ideal of an n-dimensional local Gorenstein ring R. In this paper we will describe several necessary and sufficient conditions such that the ideal I becomes cohomologically complete intersections. In fact, as a technical tool, it will be shown that the vanishing H^i_{I}(R)= 0 for all i\neq c= \grade (I) is equivalent to the vanishing of the Betti numbers of H^c_{I}(R). This gives a new characterization to check the cohomologically complete intersections property with the homological properties of the vanishing of Tor modules of H^c_{I}(R).
