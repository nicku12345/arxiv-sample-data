In this paper, we obtain a generalization, in dimension 3, of a theorem of David Rees about joint reductions of the bigraded filtration \{ \overline{I^rJ^s}\} of complete {\mathfrak m}-primary ideals and vanishing of the second normal Hilbert coefficient \overline{e}_2(IJ) where R is a two-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay analytically unramified local ring with maximal ideal \mathfrak m. This generalization is obtained as a consequence of a formula for the third local cohomology module of the extended Rees algebras of the \mathbb Z^3-graded filtration \{\overline{I^rJ^sK^t}\} with support in the ideal (x_1t_1,x_2t_2,x_3t_3) where (x_1,x_2,x_3) is a good joint reduction of \{\overline{I^rJ^sK^t}\}.
