Let R=k[x_1,\dots,x_n] be a ring of polynomials over a field k of characteristic p>0. There is an algorithm due to Lyubeznik for deciding the vanishing of local cohomology modules H^i_I(R) where I\subset R is an ideal. This algorithm has not been implemented because its complexity grows very rapidly with the growth of p which makes it impractical. In this paper we produce a modification of this algorithm that consumes a modest amount of memory.
