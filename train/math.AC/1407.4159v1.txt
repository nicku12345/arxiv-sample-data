Considering the Grothendieck group modulo numerical equivalence, we obtain the finitely generated lattice \overline{G_0(R)} for a Noetherian local ring R. Let C_{CM}(R) be the cone in \overline{G_0(R)}_{\Bbb R} spanned by cycles of maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules. We shall define the fundamental class \overline{\mu_R} of R in \overline{G_0(R)}_{\Bbb R}, which is the limit of the Frobenius direct images (divided by their rank) [{}^e R]/p^{de} in the case {ch}(R) = p > 0. The homological conjectures are deeply related to the problems whether \overline{\mu_R} is in the Cohen-Macaulay cone C_{CM}(R) or the strictly nef cone SN(R) defined below. In this paper, we shall prove that \overline{\mu_R} is in C_{CM}(R) in the case where R is FFRT or F-rational.
