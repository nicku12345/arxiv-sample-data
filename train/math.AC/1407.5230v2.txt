The dual F-signature is a numerical invariant defined via the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic. It is known that the dual F-signature characterizes some singularities. However, the value of the dual F-signature is not known except only a few cases. In this paper, we determine the dual F-signature of Cohen-Macaulay modules over two-dimensional rational double points. The method for determining the dual F-signature is also valid for determining the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity. We discuss it in appendix.
