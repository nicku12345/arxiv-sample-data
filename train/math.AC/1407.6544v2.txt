Let R be semiperfect commutative Noetherian ring and C be a semidualizing R--module. The connection of the Serre condition (S_n) on a horizontally linked R-module of finite \gc-dimension with the vanishing of certain cohomology modules of its linked module is discussed. As a consequence, it is shown that under some conditions Cohen-Macaulayness is preserved under horizontally linkage.
