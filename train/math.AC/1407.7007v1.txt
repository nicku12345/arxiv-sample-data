Let k be an arbitrary field, the purpose of this work is to provide families of positive integers \mathcal{A} = \{d_1,\ldots,d_n\} such that either the toric ideal I_{\mathcal A} of the affine monomial curve \mathcal C = \{(t^{d_1},\ldots,\,t^{d_n}) \ | \ t \in k\} \subset \mathbb{A}_k^n or the toric ideal I_{\mathcal A^{\star}} of its projective closure {\mathcal C^{\star}} \subset \mathbb{P}_k^n is a complete intersection. More precisely, we characterize the complete intersection property for I_{\mathcal A} and for I_{\mathcal A^{\star}} when:   (a) \mathcal{A} is a generalized arithmetic sequence,   (b) \mathcal{A} \setminus \{d_n\} is a generalized arithmetic sequence and d_n \in \mathbb{Z}^+,   (c) \mathcal{A} consists of certain terms of the (p,q)-Fibonacci sequence, and   (d) \mathcal{A} consists of certain terms of the (p,q)-Lucas sequence.   The results in this paper arise as consequences of those in Bermejo et al. [J. Symb. Comput. 42 (2007)], Bermejo and Garc\'{\i}a-Marco [J. Symb. Comput. (2014), to appear] and some new results regarding the toric ideal of the curve.
