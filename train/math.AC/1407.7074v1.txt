Let f: A\rightarrow B and g: A\rightarrow C be two commutative ring homomorphisms and let J and J' be two ideals of B and C, respectively, such that f^{-1}(J)=g^{-1}(J'). The \emph{bi-amalgamation} of A with (B, C) along (J, J') with respect to (f,g) is the subring of B\times C given by A\bowtie^{f,g}(J,J'):=\big\{(f(a)+j,g(a)+j') \mid a\in A, (j,j')\in J\times J'\big\}.   This paper investigates ring-theoretic properties of \emph{bi-amalgamations} and capitalizes on previous works carried on various settings of pullbacks and amalgamations. In the second and third sections, we provide examples of bi-amalgamations and show how these constructions arise as pullbacks. The fourth section investigates the transfer of some basic ring theoretic properties to bi-amalgamations and the fifth section is devoted to the prime ideal structure of these constructions. All new results agree with recent studies in the literature on D'Anna-Finocchiaro-Fontana's amalgamations and duplications.
