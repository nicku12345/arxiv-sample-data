Given a semidualizing module C over a commutative noetherian ring, Holm and J\o{}rgensen investigate some connections between C-Gorenstein dimensions of an R-complex and Gorenstein dimensions of the same complex viewed as a complex over the "trivial extension" R \ltimes C. We generalize some of their results to a certain type of retract diagram. We also investigate some examples of such retract diagrams, namely D'Anna and Fontana's amalgamated duplication and Enescu's pseudocanonical cover.
