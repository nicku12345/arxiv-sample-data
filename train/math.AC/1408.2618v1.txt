Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring of dimension d and B=R[X_1,\ldots,X_m,Y_1^{\pm 1},\ldots,Y_n^{\pm 1}] a Laurent polynomial ring over R. If A=B[Y,f^{-1}] for some f\in R[Y], then we prove the following results:   (i) If f is a monic polynomial, then Serre dimension of A is \leq d. In case n=0, this result is due to Bhatwadekar, without the condition that f is a monic polynomial.   (ii) The p-th Euler class group E^p(A) of A, defined by Bhatwadekar and Raja Sridharan, is trivial for p\geq max \{d+1, \dim A -p+3\}. In case m=n=0, this result is due to Mandal-Parker.
