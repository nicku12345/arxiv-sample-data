This is my PhD thesis from 2004 under Prof. S.M. Bhatwadekar. Here we answer a question of Nori and prove the following result. Let A be a smooth affine domain of dimension d over an infinite perfect field. Let I be an ideal of A[T] of height n such that 2n \geq d+3. Given surjections \phi:(A[T]/I)^n \rightarrow I/I^2 and \rho :A^n \rightarrow I(0) such that \phi(0)=\rho \otimes A/I(0), then there exist a surjection \Phi :A[T]^n \rightarrow I such that \Phi(0)=\rho and \Phi \otimes A/I =\phi. This is a joint work with S.M. Bhatwadekar.
