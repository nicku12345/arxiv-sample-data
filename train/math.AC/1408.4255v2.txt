Let \mathbb{K} be a field, and let S=\mathbb{K}[X_1, ..., X_n] be the polynomial ring. Let I be a monomial ideal of S with up to 5 generators. In this paper, we present a computational experiment which allows us to prove that \mathrm{depth}_S S/I = \mathrm{sdepth}_S S/I < \mathrm{sdepth}_S I. This shows that the Stanley conjecture is true for S/I and I, if I can be generated by at most 5 monomials. The result also brings additional computational evidence for a conjecture made by Herzog.
