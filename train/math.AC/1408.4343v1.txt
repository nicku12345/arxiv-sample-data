We present an algorithm to compute the primary decomposition of a submodule \mathcal{N} of the free module \Z[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^m. For this purpose we use algorithms for primary decomposition of ideals in the polynomial ring over the integers. The idea is to compute first the minimal associated primes of \mathcal{N}, i.e. the minimal associated primes of the ideal \Ann(\Z[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^m /\mathcal{N}) in \Z[x_1,\ldots,x_n] and then compute the primary components using pseudo-primary decomposition and extraction, following the ideas of Shimoyama-Yokoyama. The algorithms are implemented in {\sc Singular}.
