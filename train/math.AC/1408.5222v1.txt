The paper deals with special types of L-ordered set, L-fuzzy complete lattices, and fuzzy directed complete posets (fuzzy dcpos). First, a theorem for constructing monotone maps is proved, a characterization for monotone maps on an L-fuzzy complete lattice is obtained, and it is proved that if f is a monotone map on an L-fuzzy complete lattice (P;e), then \sqcap S_f is the least fixpoint of f. A relation between L-fuzzy complete lattices and fixpoints is found and fuzzy versions of monotonicity, rolling, fusion and exchange rules on L-complete lattices are stated. Finally, we investigate Hom(P,P), where (P;e) is a fuzzy dcpo, and we show that Hom(P,P) is a fuzzy dcpo, the map \gamma\mapsto \bigwedge_{x\in P}e(x,\gamma(x)) is a fuzzy directed subset of Hom(P,P), and we investigate its join.
