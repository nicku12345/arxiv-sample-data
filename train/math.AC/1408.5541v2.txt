Minimal values of multiplicities of ideals have a strong relation with the depth of blowup algebras. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Goto-minimal j-multiplicity for ideals of maximal analytic spread. In a Cohen-Macaulay ring, inspired by the work of S. Goto, A. Jayanthan, T. Puthenpurakal, and J. Verma, we study the interplay among this new notion, the notion of minimal j-multiplicity introduced by C. Polini and Y. Xie, and the Cohen-Macaulayness of the fiber cone of ideals satisfying certain residual assumptions. We are also able to provide a bound on the reduction number of ideals of Goto-minimal j-multiplicity having either Cohen-Macaulay associated graded algebra, or linear decay in the depth of their powers.
