These notes are based on three lectures given by the first author as part of an introductory workshop at MSRI for the program in Commutative Algebra, 2012-13. The notes follow the talks, but there are extra comments and explanations, as well as a new section on the uniform Artin-Rees theorem. The notes deal with the theme of uniform bounds, both absolute and effective, as well as uniform annihilation of cohomology
