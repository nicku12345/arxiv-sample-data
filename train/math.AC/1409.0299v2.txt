Let A\subset B be an extension of commutative reduced rings and M\subset N an extension of positive commutative cancellative torsion-free monoids. We prove that A is subintegrally closed in B and M is subintegrally closed in N if and only if the group of invertible A-submodules of B is isomorphic to the group of invertible A[M]-submodules of B[N]. In case M=N, we prove the same without the assumption that the ring extension is reduced.
