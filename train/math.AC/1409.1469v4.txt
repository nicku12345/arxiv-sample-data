We use the theory of Auslander Buchweitz approximations to classify certain resolving subcategories containing a semidualizing or a dualizing module. In particular, we show that if the ring has a dualizing module, then the resolving subcategories containing maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules are in bijection with grade consistent functions and thus are the precisely the dominant resolving subcategories.
