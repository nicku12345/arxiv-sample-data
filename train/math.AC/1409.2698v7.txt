This paper concerns the enumeration of isomorphism classes of modules of a polynomial algebra in several variables over a finite field. This is the same as the classification of commuting tuples of matrices over a finite field up to simultaneous similarity. Let c_{n,k}(q) denote the number of isomorphism classes of n-dimensional \mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dotsc,x_k]-modules. The generating function \sum_k c_{n,k}(q)t^k is a rational function. We compute this function for n\leq 4. We find that its coefficients are polynomial functions in q with non-negative integer coefficients.
