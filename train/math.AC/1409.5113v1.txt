Let F be a field, let D be a subring of F, and let {\mathfrak{X}} be the Zariski-Riemann space of valuation rings containing D and having quotient field F. We consider the Zariski, inverse and patch topologies on {\mathfrak{X}} when viewed as a projective limit of projective integral schemes having function field contained in F, and we characterize the locally ringed subspaces of {\mathfrak{X}} that are affine schemes.
