Let R=\bigoplus_{\underline{n} \in \mathbb{N}^t}R_{\underline{n}} be a commutative Noetherian \mathbb{N}^t-graded ring, and L = \bigoplus_{\underline{n}\in\mathbb{N}^t}L_{\underline{n}} be a finitely generated \mathbb{N}^t-graded R-module. We prove that there exists a positive integer k such that for any \underline{n} \in \mathbb{N}^t with L_{\underline{n}} \neq 0, there exists a primary decomposition of the zero submodule O_{\underline{n}} of L_{\underline{n}} such that for any P \in {\rm Ass}_{R_0}(L_{\underline{n}}), the P-primary component Q in that primary decomposition contains P^k L_{\underline{n}}. We also give an example which shows that not all primary decompositions of O_{\underline{n}} in L_{\underline{n}} have this property. As an application of our result, we prove that there exists a fixed positive integer l such that the 0^{\rm th} local cohomology H_I^0(L_{\underline{n}}) = \big(0 :_{L_{\underline{n}}} I^l\big) for all ideals I of R_0 and for all \underline{n} \in \mathbb{N}^t.
