Let G be a graph and let I be the edge ideal of G. Our main results in this article provide lower bounds for the depth of the first three powers of I in terms of the diameter of G. More precisely, we show that \depth R/I^t \geq \left\lceil{\frac{d-4t+5}{3}} \right\rceil +p-1, where d is the diameter of G, p is the number of connected components of G and 1 \leq t \leq 3. For general powers of edge ideals we show
