This paper establishes an analogue of the special chain theorem for the embedding dimension of polynomial rings, with direct application on the (embedding) codimension. In particular, we recover a classic result on the transfer of regularity to polynomial rings (initially proved via a combination of Serre's result on finite global dimension and Hilbert theorem on syzygies). A second application characterizes regularity in general settings of localizations of polynomial rings, including Nagata rings and Serre's conjecture rings.
