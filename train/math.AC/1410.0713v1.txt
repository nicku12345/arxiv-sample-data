In recent years, the combinatorial properties of monomials ideals and binomial ideals have been widely studied. In particular, combinatorial interpretations of free resolution algorithms have been given in both cases. In this present work, we will introduce similar techniques, or modify existing ones to obtain two new results. The first is S[\Lambda]-resolutions of \Lambda-invariant submodules of k[\mathbb{Z}^n] where \Lambda is a lattice in \mathbb{Z}^n satisfying some trivial conditions. A consequence will be the ability to resolve submodules of k[\mathbb{Z}^n/\Lambda], and in particular ideals J of S/I_{\Lambda}, where I_{\Lambda} is the lattice ideal of \Lambda.   Second, we will provide a detailed account in three dimensions on how to lift the aforementioned resolutions to resolutions in k[x,y,z] of ideals with monomial and binomial generators.
