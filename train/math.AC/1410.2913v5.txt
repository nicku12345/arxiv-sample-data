If \mathscr{G} = (G, +) is an abelian group, S \subset G is said to scatter under addition if for all a,b \in S, a+b \not \in S. If \mathscr{U}^{n}_{p} is the set of nth roots of unity in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, where n \geq 3 is an integer and p is a prime such that n|(p-1), \mathscr{U}^{n}_{p} does not scatter under addition when 6|n, and \mathscr{U}^{n}_{p} scatters under addition for all but a finite number of p otherwise. Experimental data on the smallest, largest, and density of scattering modulus for n \leq 10^8 is also presented.
