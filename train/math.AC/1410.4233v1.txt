In this paper we consider extremal and almost extremal bounds on the normal Hilbert coefficients of {\mathfrak m}-primary ideals of an analytically unramified Cohen-Macaulay ring R of dimension d>0 and infinite residue field. In these circumstances we show that the associated graded ring of the normal filtration of the ideal is either Cohen-Macaulay or almost Cohen-Macaulay.
