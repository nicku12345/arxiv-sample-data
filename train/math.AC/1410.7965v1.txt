Let K be a field, R be a standard graded K-algebra and M be a finitely generated graded R-module. The rate of M, \rate_R(M), is a measure of the growth of the shifts in the minimal graded free resolution of M.   In this paper, we study the rate of Veronese modules of M. More precisely, it is shown that   \rate_{R^{(c)}}(M)\leq \lceil \max\{\rate_{R}(M),\rat(R)\}/c\rceil+\max\{0,\lceil t^{R}_{0}(M)/c\rceil\}, for all c\geq   1. This extends a result of Herzog et al.   As a consequence of this, if M is generated in degree zero, then \reg_{R^{(c)}}(M)=0, for all   c\geq \max\{\rate_{R}(M), \rat(R)\}.   Also, for powers of the homogeneous maximal ideal \m of R, it is shown that \rate_{R^{(c)}}(\m^{s}(s))\leq \lceil \rat(R)/c\rceil, for all c\geq 1. In particular case, we give a simple proof to a theorem of Backelin.
