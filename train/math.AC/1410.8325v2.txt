Let K be a field, R a standard graded K-algebra and M be a finitely generated graded R-module. The rate of M, rate_R(M), is a measure of the growth of the shifts in the minimal graded free resolution of M. In this paper, we find upper bounds for this invariant. More precisely, let (A,\mathfrak{n}) be a regular local ring and I\subseteq \mathfrak{n} ^t be an ideal of A, where t\geq 2. We prove that if (B=A/I, \mathfrak{m} =\mathfrak{n} /I) is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with multiplicity e(B)= \binom{h+t-1}{h}, where h=embdim(B)-dim B, then rat(gr_{\mathfrak{m}}(B))=t-1 and for every B-module N, which annihilated by a minimal reduction of \mathfrak{m}, rate_{gr_{\mathfrak{m}}(B)}(gr_{\mathfrak{m}}(N))\leq t-1.
