We derive bounds on the regularity of the algebra C^\alpha(\mathcal{P}) of mixed splines over a central polytopal complex \mathcal{P}\subset\mathbb{R}^3. As a consequence we bound the largest integer d (the postulation number) for which the Hilbert polynomial HP(C^\alpha(\mathcal{P}),d) disagrees with the Hilbert function HF(C^\alpha(\mathcal{P}),d)=\dim C^\alpha(\mathcal{P})_d. The polynomial HP(C^\alpha(\mathcal{P}),d) has been computed in [DiPasquale 2014], building on [McDonald-Schenck 09] and [Geramita-Schenck 98]. Hence the regularity bounds obtained indicate when a known polynomial gives the correct dimension of the spline space C^\alpha(\mathcal{P})_d. In the simplicial case with all smoothness parameters equal, we recover a bound originally due to [Hong 91] and [Ibrahim and Schumaker 91].
