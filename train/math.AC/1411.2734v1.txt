Let R be an excellent regular ring of dimension d containing a field K of characteristic zero. Let I be an ideal in R. We show that Ass \ H^{d-1}_I(R) is a finite set. As an application we show that if I is an ideal of height g with height \ Q = g for all minimal primes of I then for all but finitely many primes P \supseteq I with height \ P \geq g +2, the topological space Spec^\circ(R_P/IR_P) is connected.
