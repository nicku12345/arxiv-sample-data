Let \mathbb{A}_n^m be an arbitrary n-dimensional commutative associative algebra over the field of complex numbers with m idempotents. Let e_1=1,e_2,e_3 be elements of \mathbb{A}_n^m which are linearly independent over the field of real numbers. We consider monogenic (i.e. continuous and differentiable in the sense of Gateaux) functions of the variable xe_1+ye_2+ze_3 where x,y,z are real, and obtain a constructive description of all mentioned functions by means of holomorphic functions of complex variables. It follows from this description that monogenic functions have Gateaux derivatives of all orders.
