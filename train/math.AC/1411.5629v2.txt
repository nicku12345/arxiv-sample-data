A natural extension of bipartite graphs are d-partite clutters, where d \geq 2 is an integer. For a poset P, Ene, Herzog and Mohammadi introduced the d-partite clutter \mathcal{C}_{P,d} of multichains of length d in P, showing that it is Cohen-Macaulay. We prove that the cover ideal of \mathcal{C}_{P,d} admits an x_i-splitting, determining a recursive formula for its Betti numbers and generalizing a result of Francisco, H\`a and Van Tuyl on the cover ideal of Cohen-Macaulay bipartite graphs. Moreover we prove a Betti splitting result for the Alexander dual of a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex.
