In this paper we build off of Takahashi and White's \mathcal{P}_C-projective dimension and \mathcal{I}_C-injective dimension to define these dimensions for when C is a semidaulizing complex. We develop the framework for these homological dimensions by establishing base change results and local-global behavior. Furthermore, we investigate how these dimensions interact with other invariants.
