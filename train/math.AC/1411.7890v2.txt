Let I\subset K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] be a zero-dimensional monomial ideal, and \Delta(I) be the simplicial complex whose Stanley--Reisner ideal is the polarization of I. It follows from a result of Soleyman Jahan that \Delta(I) is shellable. We give a new short proof of this fact by providing an explicit shelling. Moreover, we show that \Delta(I) is even vertex decomposable. The ideal L(I), which is defined to be the Stanley--Reisner ideal of the Alexander dual of \Delta(I), has a linear resolution which is cellular and supported on a regular CW-complex. All powers of L(I) have a linear resolution. We compute \mathrm{depth}\ L(I)^k and show that \mathrm{depth}\ L(I)^k=n for all k\geq n.
