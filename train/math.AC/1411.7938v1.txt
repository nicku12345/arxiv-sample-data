We study absolutely Koszul algebras, Koszul algebras with the Backelin-Roos property and their behavior under standard algebraic operations. In particular, we identify some Veronese subrings of polynomial rings that have the Backelin-Roos property and conjecture that the list is indeed complete. Among other things, we prove that every universally Koszul ring defined by monomials has the Backelin-Roos property.
