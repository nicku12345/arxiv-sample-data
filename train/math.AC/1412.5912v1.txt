Let R be a commutative, Noetherian, local ring and M an R-module. Consider the module of homomorphisms \operatorname{Hom}_R(R/\mathfrak{a},M/\mathfrak{b} M) where \mathfrak{b}\subseteq\mathfrak{a} are parameter ideals of M. When M=R and R is Cohen-Macaulay, Rees showed that this module of homomorphisms is always isomorphic to R/\mathfrak{a}, and in particular, a free module over R/\mathfrak{a} of rank one. In this work, we study the structure of such modules of homomorphisms for general M.
