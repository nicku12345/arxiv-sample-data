A result of Foxby states that if there exists a complex with finite depth, finite flat dimension, and finite injective dimension over a local ring R, then R is Gorenstein. In this paper we investigate some homological dimensions involving a semidualizing complex and improve on Foxby's result by answering a question of Takahashi and White. In particular, we prove for a semidualizing complex C, if there exists a complex with finite depth, finite \mathcal{F}_C-projective dimension, and finite \mathcal{I}_C-injective dimension over a local ring R, then R is Gorenstein.
