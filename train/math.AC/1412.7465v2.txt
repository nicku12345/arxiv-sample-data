Inspired by Jorgensen et. al., it is proved that if a Cohen--Macaulay local ring R with dualizing module admits a suitable chain of semidualizing R--modules of length n, then R\cong Q/(I_1+\cdots+I_n) for some Gorenstein ring Q and ideals I_1,\cdots, I_n of Q; and, for each \Lambda\subseteq [n], the ring Q/(\Sigma_{l\in \Lambda} I_l) has some interesting cohomological properties . This extends the result of Jorgensen et. al., and also of Foxby and Reiten.
