Semi-regular sequences over \mathbb{F}_2 are sequences of homogeneous elements of the algebra  B^{(n)}=\mathbb{F}_2[X_1,...,X_n]/(X_1^2,...,X_n^2) , which have as few relations between them as possible. They were introduced in order to assess the complexity of Gr\"obner basis algorithms such as {\bf F}_4, {\bf F}_5 for the solution of polynomial equations. Despite the experimental evidence that semi-regular sequences are common, it was unknown whether there existed semi-regular sequences for all n, except in extremely trivial situations. We prove some results on the existence and non-existence of semi-regular sequences. In particular, we show that if an element of degree d in B^{(n)} is semi-regular, then we must have n\leq 3d. Also, we show that if d=2^t and n=3d there exits a semi-regular element of degree d establishing that the bound is sharp for infinitely many n. Finally, we generalize the result of non-existence of semi-regular elements to the case of sequences of a fixed length m.
