Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring of prime characteristic p and f:R\to R the Frobenius ring homomorphism. For e\ge 1 let R^{(e)} denote the ring R viewed as an R-module via f^e. Results of Peskine, Szpiro, and Herzog state that for finitely generated modules M, M has finite projective dimension if and only if \operatorname{Tor}_i^R(R^{(e)},M)=0 for all i>0 and all (equivalently, infinitely many) e\ge 1. We prove this statement holds for arbitrary modules using the theory of flat covers and minimal flat resolutions.
