We investigate the presence of Cohen-Macaulay ideals in invariant rings and show that an ideal of an invariant ring corresponding to a modular representation of a p-group is not Cohen-Macaulay unless the invariant ring itself is. As an intermediate result, we obtain that non-Cohen-Macaulay factorial rings cannot contain Cohen-Macaulay ideals. For modular cyclic groups of prime order, we show that the quotient of the invariant ring modulo the transfer ideal is always Cohen-Macaulay, extending a result of Fleischmann.
