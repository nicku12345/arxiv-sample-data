Let (R,\mathfrak{m},k) denote a local ring. For I and J ideals of R, for all integer i, let H^i_{I,J}(-) denote the i-th local cohomology functor with respect to (I,J). Here we give a generalized version of Local Duality Theorem for local cohomology defined by a pair of ideals. Also, for M be a finitely generated R-module, we study the behavior of the endomorphism rings H^t_{I,J}(M) and D(H^t_{I,J}(M)) where t is the smallest integer such that the local cohomology with respect to a pair of ideals is non-zero and D(-):= {\rm Hom}_R(-,E_R(k)) is the Matlis dual functor. We show too that if R be a d-dimensional complete Cohen-Macaulay and H^i_{I,J}(R)=0 for all i\neq t, the natural homomorphism R\rightarrow {\rm Hom}_R(H^t_{I,J}(K_R), H^t_{I,J}(K_R)) is an isomorphism and for all i\neq t, where K_R denote the canonical module of R.
