Let I be an arbitrary ideal generated by binomials. We show that certain equivalence classes of fibers are associated to any minimal binomial generating set of I. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the indispensable binomials of a binomial ideal from a given generating set of binomials and an algorithm to detect whether a binomial ideal is generated by indispensable binomials.
