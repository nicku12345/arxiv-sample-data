We classify all rational maps H \in K(x)^n for which {\rm trdeg}_K K(tH_1,tH_2,\ldots,tH_n) \le 2, where K is any field and t is another indeterminate.   Furthermore, we classify all such maps for which additionally JH \cdot H = {\rm tr} JH \cdot H (where JH is the Jacobian matrix of H), i.e.  \sum_{i=1}^n H_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} H_k = \sum_{i=1}^n H_k \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} H_i  for all k \le n. This generalizes a theorem of Paul Gordan and Max N\"other, in which both sides and the characteristic of K are assumed to be zero.   Besides this, we use some of our tools to obtain several results about K-subalgebras R of K(x) for which {\rm trdeg}_K L = 1, where L is the fraction field of R.   We start with some observations about to what extent, L\"uroth's theorem can be generalized.
