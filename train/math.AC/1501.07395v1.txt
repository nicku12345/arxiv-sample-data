In this paper we show that a large class of one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings (A,\mathfrak{m}) has the property that if M is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay A-module then the Hilbert function of M ( with respect to \mathfrak{m}) is non-decreasing. Examples include   (1) Complete intersections A = Q/(f,g) where (Q,\mathfrak{n}) is regular local of dimension three and f \in \mathfrak{n}^2 \setminus \mathfrak{n}^3.   (2) One dimensional Cohen-Macaulay quotients of a two dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring with pseudo-rational singularity.
