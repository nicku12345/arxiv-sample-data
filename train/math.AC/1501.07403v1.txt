Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a complete intersection ring of dimension d and let I be an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal. Let M be a maximal \CM \ A-module. For i = 0,1,\cdots,d, let e_i^I(M) denote the i^{th} Hilbert -coefficient of M with respect to I. We prove that for i = 0, 1, 2, the function j \mapsto e_i^I(Syz_j^A(M)) is of quasi-polynomial type with period 2. Let G_I(M) be the associated graded module of M with respect to I. If G_I(A) is Cohen-Macaulay and \dim A \leq 2 we also prove that the functions j \mapsto depth \ G_I(Syz^A_{2j+i}(M)) are eventually constant for i = 0, 1. Let \xi_I(M) = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} depth \ G_{I^l}(M). Finally we prove that if \dim A = 2 and G_I(A) is Cohen-Macaulay then the functions j \mapsto \xi_I(Syz^A_{2j + i}(M)) are eventually constant for i = 0, 1.
