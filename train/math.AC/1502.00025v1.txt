The feedback class of a locally Brunovsky linear system is fully determined by the decomposition of state space as direct sum of system invariants [4]. In this paper we attack the problem of enumerating all feedback classes of locally Brunovsky systems over a n-dimensional state space and translate to the combinatorial problem of enumerating all the partitions of integer n in some abelian semigroup. The problem of computing the number \nu(n,k) of all the partitions of integer n into k different summands is pointed out.
