Let I be an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring R. Let M and N be any R-modules. We define the generalized completion homology modules L_i\Lambda^I (N,M), for i\in \mathbb{Z}, as the homologies of the complex \lim\limits_{\longleftarrow}(N/I^sN\otimes_R F_{\cdot}^R). Here F_{\cdot}^R denote a flat resolution of M. In this article we will prove the vanishing and non-vanishing properties of L_i\Lambda^I (N,M). We denote H^{i}_{I}(N,M) (resp. U^I_i(N,M)) by the generalized local cohomology modules (resp. the generalized local homology modules). As a technical tool we will construct several natural homomorphisms of L_i\Lambda^I (N,M), H^{i}_{I}(N,M) and U^I_i(N,M). We will investigate when these natural homomorphisms are isomorphisms. Moreover if M is Artinian and N is finitely generated then it is proven that L_i\Lambda^I (N,M) is isomorphic to U^I_i(N,M) for each i\in \mathbb{Z}. The similar result is obtained for H^i_{I}(N,M). Furthermore if both M and N are finitely generated with c=\grade(I,M). Then we are able to prove several necessary and sufficient conditions such that H^i_{I}(M)=0 for all i\neq c. Here H^i_{I}(M) denote the ordinary local cohomology module.
