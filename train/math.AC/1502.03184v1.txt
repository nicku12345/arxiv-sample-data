Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0 such that [k:k^p] < \infty and let f \in R = k[x_0, ..., x_n] be homogeneous of degree d. We obtain a sharp bound on the degrees in which the Frobenius action on H^n_\mathfrak{m}(R/fR) can be injective when R/fR has an isolated non-F-pure point at \mathfrak{m}. As a corollary, we show that if (R/fR)_\mathfrak{m} is not F-pure then R/fR has an isolated non-F-pure point at \mathfrak{m} if and only if the Frobenius action is injective in degrees \le -n(d-1).
