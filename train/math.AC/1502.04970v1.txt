Let R = \bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}} R_{n} be a standard graded ring, M be a finite graded R-module and J be a homogenous ideal of R. In this paper we study the graded structure of the i-th local cohomology module of M defined by a pair of ideals (R_{+},J), i.e. H^{i}_{R_{+},J}(M). More precisely, we discuss finiteness property and vanishing of the graded components H^{i}_{R_{+},J}(M)_{n}.   Also, we study the Artinian property and tameness of certain submodules and quotient modules of H^{i}_{R_{+},J}(M).
