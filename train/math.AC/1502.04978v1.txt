Let I and J be two ideals of a commutative Noetherian ring R and M be an R-module. For a non-negative integer n it is shown that, if the sets \Ass_R(\Ext^{n} _{R}(R/I,M)) and \Supp_R(\Ext^{i}_{R}(R/I,H^{j}_{I,J} (M))) are finite for all i \leq n+1 and all j< n, then so is \linebreak\Ass_R(\Hom_{R}(R/I,H^{n}_{I,J}(M))). We also study the finiteness of \Ass_R(\Ext^{i}_{R}(R/I,H^{n}_{I,J} (M))) for i=1,2.
