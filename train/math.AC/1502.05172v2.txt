In this paper, we investigate the notions of \mathcal{X}^\bot-projective, \mathcal{X}-injective and \mathcal{X}-flat modules and give some characterizations of these modules, where \mathcal{X} is a class of left R-modules. We prove that the class of all \mathcal{X}^\bot-projective modules is Kaplansky. Further, if the class of all \mathcal{X}-projective R-modules is closed under direct limits, we show the existence of \mathcal{X}^\bot-projective covers and \mathcal{X}-injective envelopes over a \mathcal{X}^\bot-hereditary ring R. Moreover, we decompose a \mathcal{X}^\bot-projective module into a projective and a coreduced \mathcal{X}^\bot-projective module over a self \mathcal{X}-injective and \mathcal{X}^\bot-hereditary ring. Finally, we prove that every module has a \mathcal{W}-injective precover over a coherent ring R, where \mathcal{W} is the class of all pure projective modules.
