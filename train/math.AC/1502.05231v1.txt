Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a quasi-unmixed local ring and I an equimultiple ideal of R of analytic spread s. In this paper, we introduce the equimultiple coefficient ideals. Fix k\in \{1,...,s\}. The largest ideal L containing I such that e_{i}(I_{\mathfrak{p}})=e_{i}(L_{\mathfrak{p}}) for each i \in \{1,...,k\} and each minimal prime \mathfrak{p} of I is called the k-th equimultiple coefficient ideal denoted by I_{k}. It is a generalization of the coefficient ideals firstly introduced by Shah \cite{S} for the case of \mathfrak{m}-primary ideals. We also see applications of these ideals. For instance, we show that the associated graded ring G_{I}(R) satisfies the S_{1} condition if and only if I^{n}=(I^{n})_{1} for all n.
