We provide the sufficient conditions for Rees algebras of modules to be Cohen-Macaulay, which has been proven in the case of Rees algebras of ideals by Johnson-Ulrich and Goto-Nakamura-Nishida. As it turns out the generalization from ideals to modules is not just a routine generalization, but requires a great deal of technical development. We use the technique of generic Bourbaki ideals introduced by Simis, Ulrich and Vasconcelos to obtain the Cohen-Macaulayness of Rees Algebras of modules.
