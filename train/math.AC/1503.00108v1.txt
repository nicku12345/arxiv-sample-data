All rings are commutative with 1 and n is a positive integer. Let \phi: J(R)\to J(R)\cup{\emptyset} be a function where J(R) denotes the set of all ideals of R. We say that a proper ideal I of R is \phi-n-absorbing primary if whenever a_1,a_2,...,a_{n+1}\in R and a_1a_2\cdots a_{n+1}\in I\backslash\phi(I), either a_1a_2\cdots a_n\in I or the product of a_{n+1} with (n-1) of a_1,...,a_n is in \sqrt{I}. The aim of this paper is to investigate the concept of \phi-n-absorbing primary ideals.
