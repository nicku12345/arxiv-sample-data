Let \mm=(m_0,m_1,m_2,n) be an almost arithmetic sequence, i.e., a sequence of positive integers with {\rm gcd}(m_0,m_1,m_2,n) = 1, such that m_0<m_1<m_2 form an arithmetic progression, n is arbitrary and they minimally generate the numerical semigroup \Gamma = m_0\N + m_1\N + m_2\N + n\N. Let k be a field. The homogeneous coordinate ring k[\Gamma] of the affine monomial curve parametrically defined by X_0=t^{m_0},X_{1}=t^{m_1},X_2=t^{m_3},Y=t^{n} is a graded R-module, where R is the polynomial ring k[X_0,X_1,X_3, Y] with the grading \deg{X_i}:=m_i, \deg{Y}:=n. In this paper, we construct a minimal graded free resolution for k[\Gamma].
