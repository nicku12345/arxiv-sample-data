This paper investigates the relationship between multiplicities and the degree sequence of ideals in graded algebras, gives multiplicity equations of graded rings via the degree sequence of ideals, and characterizes mixed multiplicities and multiplicities of Rees rings in terms of the degree sequence of ideals. As an application, the paper answered an open question on the multiplicity of Rees rings.
