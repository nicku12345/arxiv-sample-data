We deal with the algebraicity of a Puiseux series in terms of the properties of its coefficients. We show that the algebraicity of a Puiseux series for given bounded degree is determined by a finite number of explicit polynomial formulae. Conversely, given a vanishing polynomial, there is a closed-form formula for the coefficients of the series in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial and of an initial part of the series.
