Let R be a Noetherian ring and let C be a semidualizing R-module. In this paper, we are concerned with the tensor and torsion product of C-injective modules. Firstly, it is shown that the tensor product of any two C-injective R-modules is C-injective if and only if the injective hull of C is C-flat. Secondly, it is proved that C is a pointwise dualizing R-module if and only if Tor^R_i(M,N) is C-injective for all C-injective R-modules M and N, and all  i \geq 0. These results recover the celebrated theorems of Enochs and Jenda \cite{EJ2}.
