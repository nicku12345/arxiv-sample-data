We generalize the geometric sequence \{a^p, a^{p-1}b, a^{p-2}b^2,...,b^p\} to allow the p copies of a (resp. b) to all be different. We call the sequence \{a_1a_2a_3\cdots a_p, b_1a_2a_3\cdots a_p, b_1b_2a_3\cdots a_p,\ldots, b_1b_2b_3\cdots b_p\} a \emph{compound sequence}. We consider numerical semigroups whose minimal set of generators form a compound sequence, and compute various semigroup and arithmetical invariants, including the Frobenius number, Ap\'ery sets, Betti elements, and catenary degree. We compute bounds on the delta set and the tame degree.
