We call a simplicial complex algebraically rigid if its Stanley-Reisner ring admits no nontrivial infinitesimal deformations, and call it inseparable if does not allow any deformation to other simplicial complexes. Algebraically rigid simplicial complexes are inseparable. In this paper we study inseparability and rigidity of Stanley-Reisner rings, and apply the general theory to letterplace ideals as well as to edge ideals of graphs. Classes of algebraically rigid simplicial complexes and graphs are identified.
