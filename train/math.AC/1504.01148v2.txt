Let R be a Noetherian ring, I an ideal of R and M an R-module with \operatorname{cd}(I,M)=c. In this article, we first show that there exists a descending chain of ideals I=I_c\supsetneq I_{c-1}\supsetneq \cdots \supsetneq I_0 of R such that for each 0\leq i\leq c-1, \operatorname{cd}(I_i,M)=i and that the top local cohomology module \operatorname{H}^i_{I_i}(M) is not Artinian. We then give sufficient conditions for a non-negative integer t to be a lower bound for \operatorname{cd}(I,M) and use this to conclude that in non-catenary Noetherian local integral domains, there exist prime ideals that are not set theoretic complete intersection. Finally, we set conditions which determine whether or not a top local cohomology module is Artinian.
