Let R be a commutative ring. An R-module M is said to be super finitely presented if there is an exact sequence of R-modules \cdots\rightarrow P_n\rightarrow\cdots \rightarrow P_1\rightarrow P_0\rightarrow M\rightarrow 0 where each P_i is finitely generated projective. In this paper it is shown that if R has the property (B) that every super finitely presented module has finite Gorenstein projective dimension, then every finitely generated Gorenstein projective module is super finitely presented. As an application of the notion of super finitely presented modules, we show that if R has the property (C) that every super finitely presented module has finite projective dimension, then R is K_0-regular, i.e., K_0(R[x_1,\cdots,x_n])\cong K_0(R) for all n\geq 1.
