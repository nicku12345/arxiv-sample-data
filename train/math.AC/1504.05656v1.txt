We use dual graphs and generating sequences of valuations to compute the Poincare series of non-divisorial valuations on function fields of dimension two. The Poincare series are shown to reflect data from the dual graphs and hence carry equivalent information. This extends Galindo's earlier results on the Poincare series of divisorial valuations and consequently offers an alternative classification of valuations via Poincare series.
