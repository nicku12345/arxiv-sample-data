Let (R,\m,k) be a commutative noetherian local ring of Krull dimension d. We prove that the cohomology annihilator \ca(R) of R is \m-primary if and only if for some n\ge0 the n-th syzygies in \mod R are constructed from syzygies of k by taking direct sums/summands and a fixed number of extensions. These conditions yield that R is an isolated singularity such that the bounded derived category \db(R) and the singularity category \ds(R) have finite dimension, and the converse holds when R is Gorenstein. We also show that the modules locally free on the punctured spectrum are constructed from syzygies of finite length modules by taking direct sums/summands and d extensions. This result is exploited to investigate several ascent and descent problems between R and its completion \widehat R.
