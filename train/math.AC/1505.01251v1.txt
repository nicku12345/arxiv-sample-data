In 1960, D.G. Northcott proved that if e_0(I) and e_1(I) denote zeroth and first Hilbert-Samuel coefficients of an \mathfrak m-primary ideal I in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring (R,\mathfrak m), then e_0(I)-e_1(I)\le \ell (R/I). In this article, we study an analogue of this inequality for Buchsbaum-Rim coefficients. We prove that if (R,\mathfrak m) is a two dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring and M is a finitely generated R-module contained in a free module F with finite co-length, then br_0(M)-br_1(M)\le \ell (F/M), where br_0(M) and br_1(M) denote zeroth and first Buchsbaum-Rim coefficients respectively.
