Consider a grade 2 perfect ideal I in R=k[x_1,\cdots,x_d] which is generated by forms of the same degree. Assume that the presentation matrix \varphi is almost linear, that is, all but the last column of \varphi consist of entries which are linear. For such ideals, we find explicit forms of the defining ideal of the Rees algebra \mathcal{R}(I). We also introduce the notion of iterated Jacobian duals.
