Let R be a regular local ring of dimension at least 2. Associated to each valuation domain birationally dominating R, there exists a unique sequence \{R_n\} of local quadratic transforms of R along this valuation domain. We consider the situation where the sequence \{ R_n \}_{n \ge 0} is infinite, and examine ideal-theoretic properties of the integrally closed local domain S = \bigcup_{n \ge 0} R_n. Among the set of valuation overrings of R, there exists a unique limit point V for the sequence of order valuation rings of the R_n. We prove the existence of a unique minimal proper Noetherian overring T of S, and establish the decomposition S = T \cap V. If S is archimedian, then the complete integral closure S^{*} of S has the form S^{*} = W \cap T, where W is the rank 1 valuation overring of V.
