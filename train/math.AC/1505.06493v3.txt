Let k be a commutative ring with identity. A {\it k-plethory} is a commutative k-algebra P together with a comonad structure W_P, called the {\it P-Witt ring} functor, on the covariant functor that it represents. We say that a k-plethory P is {\it idempotent} if the command W_P is idempotent, or equivalently if the map from the trivial k-plethory k[e] to P is a k-plethory epimorphism. We prove several results on idempotent plethories. We also study the k-plethories contained in K[e], where K is the total quotient ring of k, which are necessarily idempotent and contained in \operatorname{Int}(k) = \{f \in K[e]: f(k) \subseteq k\}. For example, for any ring l between k and K we find necessary and sufficient conditions---all of which hold if k is a integral domain of Krull type---so that the ring \operatorname{Int}_l(k) = \operatorname{Int}(k) \cap l[e] has the structure, necessarily unique and idempotent, of a k-plethory with unit given by the inclusion k[e] \longrightarrow \operatorname{Int}_l(k). Our results, when applied to the binomial plethory \operatorname{Int}({\mathbb Z}), specialize to known results on binomial rings.
