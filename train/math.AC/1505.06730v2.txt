In this paper, all rings are commutative with nonzero identity. Let M be an R-module. A proper submodule N of M is called a classical prime submodule, if for each m \in M and elements a,b\in R, abm\in N implies that am\in N or bm\in N. We introduce the concept of "weakly classical prime submodules." A proper submodule N of M is a weakly classical prime submodule if whenever a,b\in R and m\in M with 0\neq abm\in N, then am\in N or bm\in N.
