The famous Jacobian Conjecture asks if a morphism f:K[x,y]\to K[x,y] with invertible Jacobian, is invertible (K is a characteristic zero field). A known result says that if K[f(x),f(y)] \subseteq K[x,y] is an integral extension, then f is invertible. We slightly generalize this known result to the following: If for some "good" \lambda \in K (in a sense that will be explained) m K[x,y] \neq K[x,y] for every maximal ideal m of K[f(x),f(y)][x+ \lambda y], then f is invertible. We also apply our ideas to the Jacobian Conjecture, without any further assumptions.
