We describe the set of all locally nilpotent derivations of the quotient ring \mathbb{K}[X,Y,Z]/(f(X)Y - \varphi(X,Z)) constructed from the defining equation f(X)Y = \varphi(X,Z) of a generalized Danielewski surface in \mathbb K^3 for a specific choice of polynomials f and \varphi, with \mathbb K an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. As a consequence of this description we calculate the ML-invariant and the Derksen invariant of this ring. We also determine a set of generators for the group of \mathbb K-automorphisms of \mathbb K[X,Y,Z]/(f(X)Y - \varphi(Z)) also for a specific choice of polynomials f and \varphi.
