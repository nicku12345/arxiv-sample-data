This paper establishes uniform bounds in characteristic p rings which are either F-finite or essentially of finite type over an excellent local ring. These uniform bounds are then used to show that the Hilbert-Kunz length functions and the normalized Frobenius splitting numbers defined on the Spectrum of a ring converge uniformly to their limits, namely the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity function and the F-signature function. From this we establish that the F-signature function is lower semi-continuous. We also give a new proof of the upper semi-continuity of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, which was originally proven by Ilya Smirnov.
