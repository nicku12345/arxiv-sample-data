We present an algorithmic equivalent statement to the Jacobian conjecture. Given a polynomial map F on an affine space of dimension n, our algorithm constructs n sequences of polynomials such that F is invertible if and only if the zero polynomial appears in all n sequences and moreover computes the inverse map of F. This algorithm provides a classification of polynomial automorphisms of affine spaces.
