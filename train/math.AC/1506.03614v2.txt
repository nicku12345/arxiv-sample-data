Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a regular local ring containing a field K. Let I be a Cohen-Macaulay ideal of height g. If \text{char } K = p > 0 then by a result of Peskine and Szpiro the local cohomology modules H^i_I(R) vanish for i > g. This result is not true if \text{char } K = 0. However we prove that the Bass numbers of the local cohomology module H^g_I(R) completely determine whether H^i_I(R) vanish for i > g.
