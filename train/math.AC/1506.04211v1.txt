Let A be an Artinian Gorenstein algebra over an infinite field k with either \hbox{char}(k)=0 or \hbox{char}(k)>\nu, where \nu is the socle degree of A. To every such algebra and a linear projection \pi on its maximal ideal {\mathfrak m} with range equal to the socle \hbox {Soc}(A) of A, one can associate a certain algebraic hypersurface S_{\pi}\subset{\mathfrak m}, which is the graph of a polynomial map P_{\pi}:\hbox{ker}\,\pi\to \hbox{Soc}(A)\simeq k. Recently, the author and his collaborators have obtained the following surprising criterion: two Artinian Gorenstein algebras A, \tilde A are isomorphic if and only if any two hypersurfaces S_{\pi} and S_{\tilde\pi} arising from A and \tilde A, respectively, are affinely equivalent. The proof is indirect and relies on a geometric argument. In the present paper we give a short algebraic proof of this statement. We also discuss a connection, established elsewhere, between the polynomials P_{\pi} and Macaulay inverse systems.
