We investigate the behavior of four coherent-like conditions in regular conductor squares. In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions in order that a pullback ring be a finite conductor ring, a coherent ring, a generalized GCD ring, or quasi-coherent ring. As an application of these results, we are able to determine exactly when the ring of integer-valued polynomials determined by a finite subset possesses one of the four coherent-like properties.
