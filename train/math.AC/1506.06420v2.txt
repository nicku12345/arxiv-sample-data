Let I be an ideal of height d in a regular local ring (R,m,k=R/m) of dimension n and let \Omega denote the canonical module of R/I. In this paper we first prove the equivalence of the following: the non-vanishing of the edge homomorphism \eta_d: \ext{R}{n-d}{k,\Omega} \rightarrow \ext{R}{n}{k,R}, the validity of the order ideal conjecture for regular local rings, and the validity of the monomial conjecture for all local rings. Next we prove several special cases of the order ideal conjecture/monomial conjecture.
