We introduce and study a class of objects that encompasses Christensen and Foxby's semidualizing modules and complexes and Kubik's quasi-dualizing modules: the class of \mathfrak{a}-adic semidualizing modules and complexes. We give examples and equivalent characterizations of these objects, including a characterization in terms of the more familiar semidualizing property. As an application, we give a proof of the existence of dualizing complexes over complete local rings that does not use the Cohen Structure Theorem.
