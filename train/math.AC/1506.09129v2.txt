We exhibit an example of a product of two proper monomial ideals such that the residue class ring is not Golod. We also discuss the strongly Golod property for rational powers of monomial ideals, and introduce some sufficient conditions for weak Golodness of monomial ideals. Along the way, we ask some related questions.
