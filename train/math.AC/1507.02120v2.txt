Let A\subset B be an integral ring extension of integral domains with fields of fractions K and L, respectively. The integral degree of A\subset B, denoted by {\rm d}_A(B), is defined as the supremum of the degrees of minimal integral equations of elements of B over A. It is an invariant that lies in between {\rm d}_K(L) and \mu_A(B), the minimal number of generators of the A-module B. Our purpose is to study this invariant. We prove that it is sub-multiplicative and upper-semicontinuous in the following three cases: if A\subset B is simple; if A\subset B is projective and finite and K\subset L is a simple algebraic field extension; or if A is integrally closed. Furthermore, {\rm d} is semicontinuous if A is noetherian of dimension 1 and with finite integral closure. In general, however, {\rm d} is neither sub-multiplicative nor upper-semicontinuous.
