Let (R, \mathfrak{m}, \Bbbk) be a Noetherian three-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay analytically unramified ring and I an \mathfrak{m}-primary R-ideal. Write X = \mathrm{Proj}\left(\oplus_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \overline{I^n}t^n\right). We prove some consequences of the vanishing of \mathrm{H}^2(X, \mathscr{O}_X), whose length equals the the constant term \bar e_3(I) of the normal Hilbert polynomial of I. Firstly, X is Cohen-Macaulay. Secondly, if the extended Rees ring A := \oplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \overline{I^n}t^n is not Cohen-Macaulay, and either R is equicharacteristic or \overline{I} = \mathfrak{m}, then \bar e_2(I) - \mathrm{length}_R\left(\frac{\overline{I^2}}{I\overline{I}}\right) \geq 3; this estimate is proved using Boij-S\"oderberg theory of coherent sheaves on \mathbb{P}^2_\Bbbk. The two results above are related to a conjecture of S. Itoh (J. Algebra, 1992). Thirdly, \mathrm{H}^2_E(X, I^m\mathscr{O}_X) = 0 for all integers m, where E is the exceptional divisor in X. Finally, if additionally R is regular and X is pseudo-rational, then the adjoint ideals \widetilde{I^n}, n \geq 1 satisfy \widetilde{I^n} = I\widetilde{I^{n-1}} for all n \geq 3. The last two results are related to conjectures of J. Lipman (Math. Res. Lett., 1994).
