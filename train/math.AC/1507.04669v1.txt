We work with rational rank 1 valuations centered in regular local rings. Given an algebraic function field K of transcendence degree 3 over k, a regular local ring R with QF(R)=K and a k-valuation \nu of K, we provide an algorithm for constructing a generating sequences for \nu in R. We then develop a method for determining a valuation \nu on k(x,y,z) through the sequence of defining values. Using the above results we construct examples of valuations centered in k[x,y,z]_{(x,y,z)} and investigate their semigroups of values.
