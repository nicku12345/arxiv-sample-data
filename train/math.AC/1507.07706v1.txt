We study the regularity and the projective dimension of the Stanley-Reisner ring of a k-decomposable simplicial complex and explain these invariants with a recursive formula. To this aim, the graded Betti numbers of k-decomposable monomial ideals which is the dual concept for k-decomposable simplicial complexes are studied and an inductive formula for the Betti numbers is given. As a corollary, for a chordal clutter \mathcal{H}, an upper bound for reg(I(\mathcal{H})) is given in terms of the regularities of edge ideals of some chordal clutters which are minors of \mathcal{H}.
