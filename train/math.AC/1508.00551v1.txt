A critical value of a function is the value of this function at one of its critical points. Each critical point of a differentiable multivariate function is described by the equations which consist in equating to zero all of its partial derivatives. However, in general case there is no equation for the corresponding critical value. The case of polynomials is different. In the present paper an equation for critical values of a polynomial is derived.
