Conditions on the Koszul complex of a noetherian local ring R guarantee that \mathrm{Tor}^{R}_{i}(M,N) is non-zero for infinitely many i, when M and N are finitely generated R-modules of infinite projective dimension. These conditions are obtained from results concerning Tor of differential graded modules over certain trivial extensions of commutative differential graded algebras.
