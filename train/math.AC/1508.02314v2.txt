We give an explicit presentation for each lower bound cluster algebra. Using this presentation, we show that each lower bound algebra Grobner degenerates to the Stanley-Reisner scheme of a vertex-decomposable ball or sphere, and is thus Cohen-Macaulay. Finally, we use Stanley-Reisner combinatorics and a result of Knutson-Lam-Speyer to show that all lower bound algebras are normal.
