This paper exhibits some new examples of the behavior of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings. More precisely, we present new examples of homogenous ideals with large regularity compared to the generating degree. Then we consider the regularity jumps of ideals. In particular we provide an infinite family of ideals having regularity jumps at a certain power.
