Let S be a commutative ring with identity and R a unitary subring of S. An ideal I of S is called an R-conductor ideal of S if I=\{x\in S\mid xS\subseteq V\} for some intermediate ring V of R and S. In this note we present necessary and sufficient criterions for being an R-conductor ideal of S. We generalize several well known facts about them and present a simple approach to rediscover the results of both old and recent papers. We sketch the boundaries of our criterions by providing a few counterexamples.
