We prove that the generalized Hilbert-Kunz function of a graded module M over a two-dimensional standard graded normal K-domain over an algebraically closed field K of prime characteristic p has the form gHK(M,q)=e_{gHK}(M)q^{2}+\gamma(q), with rational generalized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity e_{gHK}(M) and a bounded function \gamma(q). Moreover we prove that if R is a \mathbb{Z}-algebra, the limit for p\rightarrow+\infty of the generalized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity e_{gHK}^{R_p}(M_p) over the fibers R_p exists and it is a rational number.
