Let R be a Noetherian ring and let C be a semidualizing R-module. In this paper, by using the semidualizing modules, we define and study new classes of modules and homological dimensions and investigate the relations between them. In parallel, we obtain some necessary and sufficient condition for  C  to be dualizing.
