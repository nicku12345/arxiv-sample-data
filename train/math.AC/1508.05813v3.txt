Let R be a Noetherian ring and let C be a semidualizing R-module. In this paper, by using relative homological dimensions with respect to C, we impose various conditions on C to be dualizing. First, we show that C is dualizing if and only if there exists a Cohen-Macaulay R-module of type 1 and of finite G _C -dimension. This result extends Takahashi \cite[Theorem 2.3]{T} as well as Christensen \cite[Proposition 8.4]{C}. Next, as a generalization of Xu \cite[Theorem 3.2]{X2}, we show that C is dualizing if and only if for an R-module M, the necessary and sufficient condition for M to be C-injective is that  \pi_i(\fp , M) = 0  for all  \fp \in \Spec(R)  and all  i \neq \h(\fp) , where  \pi_i  is the invariant dual to the Bass numbers defined by E.Enochs and J.Xu \cite{EX}. We use the later result to give an explicit structure of the minimal flat resolution of  \H_{\fm}^d(R) , where  (R, \fm)  is a  d -dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring possessing a canonical module. As an application, we compute the torsion product of these local cohomology modules.
