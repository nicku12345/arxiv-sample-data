This is a continuation of a previous paper by the same authors. In the former paper, it was proved that in order to obtain local uniformization for valuations centered on local domains, it is enough to prove it for rank one valuations. In this paper, we extend this result to the case of valuations centered on rings which are not necessarily integral domains and may even contain nilpotents.
