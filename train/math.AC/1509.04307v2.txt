In this paper, we characterize the set of spanning trees of \mathcal{G}_{n,r}^1 (a simple connected graph consisting of n edges, containing exactly one 1-edge-connected chain of r cycles \mathbb{C}_r^1 and \mathcal{G}_{n,r}^{1}\setminus\mathbb{C}_r^1 is a forest). We compute the Hilbert series of the face ring k[\Delta_s (\mathcal{G}_{n,r}^1)] for the spanning simplicial complex \Delta_s (\mathcal{G}_{n,r}^1). Also, we characterize associated primes of the facet ideal I_{\mathcal{F}} (\Delta_s (\mathcal{G}_{n,r}^1)). Furthermore, we prove that the face ring k[\Delta_s(\mathcal{G}_{n,r}^{1})] is Cohen-Macaulay.
