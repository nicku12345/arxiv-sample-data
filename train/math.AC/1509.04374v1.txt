Using the description of the Frobenius limit of modules over the ring of invariants under an action of a finite group on a polynomial ring over a field of characteristic p>0 developed by Symonds and the author, we give a characterization of the ring of invariants with a positive dual F-signature. Combining this result and Kemper's result on depths of the ring of invariants under an action of a permutation group, we give an example of an F-rational, but non-F-regular ring of invariants under the action of a finite group.
