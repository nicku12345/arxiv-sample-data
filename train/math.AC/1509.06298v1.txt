This paper gives a description of various recent results which construct monomial ideals with a given minimal free resolution. We show that these are all instances of coordinatizing a finite atomic lattice as defined by Mapes. Subsequently, we explain how in some of these cases (in one case work by Faridi, and in another work by Fl\oystad), where questions still remain, this point of view can be applied. We also prove an equivalence in the case of trees between the notion of maximal defined by Fl\oystad and a notion of being maximal in a Betti stratum.
