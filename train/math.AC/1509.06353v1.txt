In this paper we prove that the Scott topology \mathfrak S on a rooted non-metric tree \mathcal T is strictly coarser than the weak tree topology. Moreover, for each t\in \mathcal T, we consider a natural order \preceq_t on \mathcal T under which t is the root of \mathcal T. Then the weak tree topology is generated by the union of the Scott topologies \mathfrak S_t associated to \preceq_t.
