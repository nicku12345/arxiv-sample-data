The famous Jacobian problem asks: Is a morphism f:\mathbb{C}[x,y]\to \mathbb{C}[x,y] having an invertible Jacobian, invertible? If we add the assumption that \mathbb{C}(f(x),f(y))=\mathbb{C}(x,y), then f is invertible; this result is due to O. H. Keller (1939). We suggest the following slight generalization of Keller's theorem: If f:\mathbb{C}[x,y]\to \mathbb{C}[x,y] is a morphism having an invertible Jacobian, and if there exist n \geq 1, a \in \mathbb{C}(f(x),f(y))^* and b \in \mathbb{C}(f(x),f(y)) such that (ax +b)^n \in \mathbb{C}(f(x),f(y)), then f is invertible. A similar result holds for \mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_m].
