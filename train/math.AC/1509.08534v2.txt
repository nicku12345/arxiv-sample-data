Suppose A=k[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n] is a polynomial ring over a field k and I is an ideal in A. Then M. P. Murthy conjectured that \mu(I)=\mu(I/I^2), where \mu denotes the minimal number of generators. Recently, Fasel \cite{F} settled this conjecture, affirmatively, when k is an infinite perfect field, with 1/2\in k {\rm (always)}. We are able to do the same, when k is an infinite field. In fact, we prove similar results for ideals I in a polynomial ring A=R[X], that contains a monic polynomial and R is essentially finite type smooth algebra over an infinite field k, or R is a regular ring over a perfect field k.
