We give a formula for the smallest degree of a non-Koszul relation on x_1^{d_1}, \ldots, x_n^{d_n}, (x_1+\ldots +x_n)^{d_{n+1}}\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] (under certain assumptions on d_1, \ldots, d_{n+1}) where k is a field of positive characteristic p. As an application of our result, we give a formula for the diagonal F-threshold of a diagonal hypersurface. Another application is a characterization, depending on the characteristic p of k, of the values of d_1, \ldots, d_{n+1} (satisfying certain assumptions) such that the ring k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}]/(x_1^{d_1}, \ldots, x_{n+1}^{d_{n+1}}) has the weak Lefschetz property.
