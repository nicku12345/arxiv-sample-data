Let R be a Noetherian ring and let C be a semidualizing R-module. In this paper, by using the classes  \mathcal{P}_C  and  \mathcal{I}_C , we extend the notions of perfect and coperfect modules introduced by D.Rees \cite{R} and O.Jenda \cite{J1}. First, we study the basic properties of these modules and relations between them. Next, we characterize local rings in terms of the existence of special perfect (resp. coperfect) modules.
