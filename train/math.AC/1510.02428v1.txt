We present the basic concepts of tensor products of vector spaces, emphasizing linear algebraic and combinatorial techniques as needed for applied areas of research. The topics include (1) Introduction; (2) Basic multilinear algebra; (3) Tensor products of vector spaces; (4) Tensor products of matries; (5) Inner products on tensor spaces; (6) Direct sums and tensor products; (7) Background concepts and notation.
