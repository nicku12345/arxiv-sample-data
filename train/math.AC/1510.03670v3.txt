In this paper we present a geometrical characterization for the minimum-weight codewords of the Hermitian codes over the fields \mathbb{F}_{q^2} in the third and fourth phase, namely with distance d \geq q^2-q. We consider the unique writing \mu q + \lambda (q+1) of the distance d with \mu, \lambda non negative integers, and \mu \leq q, and prove that the minimum-weight codewords correspond to complete intersection divisors cut on the Hermitian curve \mathcal{H} by curves \mathcal X of degree \mu+\lambda having x^\mu y^\lambda as leading term w.r.t. the \texttt{DegRevLex} term ordering (with y>x). Moreover, we show that any such curve \mathcal X corresponds to minimum-weight codewords provided that the complete intersection divisor \mathcal{H}\cap \mathcal X is made of simple \mathbb{F}_{q^2}-points. Finally, using this geometric characterization, we propose an algorithm to compute the number of minimum weight codewords and we present comparison tables between our algorithm and MAGMA command \mathtt{MinimumWords}.
