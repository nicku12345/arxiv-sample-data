Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and E the minimal injective cogenerator of the category of R-modules. An R-module M is (Matlis) reflexive if the natural evaluation map M \to \operatorname{Hom}_R(\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,E),E) is an isomorphism. We prove that if S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R and M is a reflexive R-module, then M is a reflexive R_S-module. The converse holds when S is the complement of the union of finitely many minimal primes of R, but fails in general.
