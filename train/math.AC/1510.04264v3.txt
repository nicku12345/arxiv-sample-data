The two dimensional Jacobian Conjecture says that a morphism f:\mathbb{C}[x,y]\to \mathbb{C}[x,y] having an invertible Jacobian, is invertible. We show that a morphism f having an invertible Jacobian is invertible, in each of the following two special cases: The degree of f(x) is \leq 2; The (0,1)-degrees or (1,0)-degrees of all monomials in f(x) are of the same parity. In each case there is no restriction on the degree of f(y) nor on the parity of the (0,1)-degrees or (1,0)-degrees of its monomials.
