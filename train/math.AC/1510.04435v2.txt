Let S be a regular local ring or a polynomial ring over a field and I be an ideal of S. Motivated by a recent result of Herzog and Huneke, we study the natural question of whether I^m is a Golod ideal for all m\geq 2. We observe that the Golod property of an ideal can be detected through the vanishing of certain maps induced in homology. This observation leads us to generalize some known results from the graded case to local rings and obtain new classes of Golod ideals.
