Let G be a simple graph on n vertices. Let H be either the complete graph K_m or the complete bipartite graph K_{r,s} on a subset of the vertices in G. We show that G contains H as a subgraph if and only if \beta_{i,\alpha}(H) \le \beta_{i,\alpha}(G) for all i \ge 0 and \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^n. In fact, it suffices to consider only the first syzygy module. In particular, we prove that \beta_{1,\alpha}(H) \le \beta_{1,\alpha}(G) for all \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^n if and only if G contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to either H or a multipartite graph K_{2,\dots,2,a,b}.
