The first two Hilbert coefficients of a primary ideal play an important role in commutative algebra and in algebraic geometry. In this paper we give a complete algebraic structure of the Sally module of integrally closed ideals I in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring A satisfying the equality \mathrm{e}_1(I)=\mathrm{e}_0(I)-\ell_A(A/I)+\ell_A(I^2/QI)+1,  where Q is a minimal reduction of I, and \mathrm{e}_0(I) and \mathrm{e}_1(I) denote the first two Hilbert coefficients of I,  respectively the multiplicity and the Chern number of I. This almost extremal value of \mathrm{e}_1(I)  with respect classical inequalities holds a complete description of the homological and the numerical invariants of the associated graded ring. Examples are given.
