The Hilbert symbol (\cdot,\cdot ) from characteristic \neq 2 has two analogues in characteristic 2, [\cdot,\cdot ) and ((\cdot,\cdot )).   In characteristic \neq 2 we have a well known result called the common slot lemma or the chain lemma. It involves the symbol (\cdot,\cdot ). This result has three analogues in characteristic 2. Two of these analogues involve the symbol [\cdot,\cdot ) and one involves ((\cdot,\cdot )). So far only one of these analogues has been considered. In this paper we state and prove the remaining two analogues.
