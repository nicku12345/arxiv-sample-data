Let (R,\fm) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of positive dimension d and infinite residue field. Let I be an \fm-primary ideal of R and J be a minimal reduction of I. In this paper we show that if \widetilde{I^k}=I^k and J\cap I^n=JI^{n-1} for all n\geq k+2, then \widetilde{I^n}=I^n for all n\geq k. As a consequence, we can deduce that if r_J(I)=2, then \widetilde{I}=I if and only if \widetilde{I^n}=I^n for all n\geq 1. Moreover, we recover some main results [\ref{Cpv}] and [\ref{G}]. Finally, we give a counter example for question 3 of [\ref{P1}].
