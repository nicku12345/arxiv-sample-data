Let f: A\rightarrow B be a ring homomorphism and J be an ideal of B. In this paper, we investigate the transfer of Armendariz-like properties to the amalgamation of A with B along J with respect to f (denoted by A\bowtie^fJ) introduced and studied by D'Anna, Finocchiaro and Fontana in 2009. Our aim is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for A\bowtie^fJ, to be an Armendariz ring, nil-Armendariz ring and weak Armendariz ring.
