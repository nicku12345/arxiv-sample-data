The relationships between the invariants and the homological properties of I, {\rm Gin}(I) and I^{\rm lex} have been studied extensively over the past decades. A result of A. Conca, J. Herzog and T. Hibi points out some rigid behaviours of their Betti numbers. In this work we establish a local cohomology counterpart of their theorem. To this end, we make use of properties of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay modules and we study a generalization of such concept by introducing what we call partially sequentially Cohen-Macaulay modules, which might be of interest by themselves.
