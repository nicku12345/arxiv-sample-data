Let R=k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I be a standard graded k-algebra where k is a field of prime characteristic and let J be a homogeneous ideal in R. Denote (x_1,\dots,x_n) by \mathfrak{m}. We prove that there is a constant C (independent of e) such that the regularity of H^s_{\mathfrak{m}}(R/J^{[p^e]}) is bounded above by Cp^e for all e\geq 1 and all integers s such that s+1 is at least the dimension of the locus where R/J doesn't have finite projective dimension.
