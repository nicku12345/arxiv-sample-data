Let F be a field of characteristic p and let E/F be a purely inseparable field extension. We study the group H_p^{n+1}(F) of classes of differential forms under the restriction map H_p^{n+1}(F)\to H_p^{n+1}(E) and give a system of generators of the kernel H_p^{n+1}(E/F). In the case p=2, we use this to determine the kernel W_q(E/F) of the restriction map W_q(F) \to W_q(E) between the group of nonsingular quadratic forms over F and over E. We also deduce the corresponding result for the bilinear Witt kernel W(E'/F) of the restriction map W(F) \to W(E'), where E'/F denotes a modular purely inseparable field extension.
