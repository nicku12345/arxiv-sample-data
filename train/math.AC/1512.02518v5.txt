We prove the (LC) conjecture of Hochster and Huneke in some non-trivial cases. This has several applications. Recently, Brenner and Caminata answered a numerical evidence due to Dao and Smirnov on the shape of generalized Hilbert-Kunz functions of smooth curves. As applications, we first reprove this by a short argument. Then we give a proof of second numerical evidence predicted by Dao and Smirnov on the shape of generalized Hilbert-Kunz functions of nodal curves. Thirdly, we answer a question posted by Vraciu on the (LC) property of a proposed ring. Inspiring with the (LC) property, we present a connection to the stability theory. This leads us to investigate the stability and the strong semistability of the sheaf of relations on \{x^2,y^2,z^2\} over the Klein's quartic curve. This answers questions of Brenner. After presenting a connection from (LC) to the F-threshold, we answer a question posted by Huneke et al. Additional applications and examples are given.
