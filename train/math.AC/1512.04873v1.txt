In this article, we study the behaviour of smooth algebra R over local Noetherian local ring A. At first, we observe that for every f\in R, R_f has finite length in the category of D(R,A)-module if dimension of A is zero. This extends the result of Theorem 2 of \cite{Ly3}. We use this fact to generalize the result of Theorem 4.1 of \cite{BBLSZ}, from the finiteness of the set of associated primes of local cohomology module to that of Lyubeznik functor. Finally, we introduce the definition of \Sigma-finite D-modulue for smooth algebra and we extend the result of Theorem 1.3 of \cite{Nu3} from polynomial and power series algebra to smooth algebra. Theorem 1.3 of \cite{Nu3} comes out as a partial answer to a question raised by Melvin Hochster. Thus, we extend the partial answer to the above question from polynomial and power series algebra to smooth algebra over an arbitrary Noetherian local ring.
