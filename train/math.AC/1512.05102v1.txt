Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a complete equicharacteristic Noetherian domain of dimension d + 1 \geq 2. Assume k = A/\mathfrak{m} has characteristic zero and that A is not a regular local ring. Let Sing(A) the singular locus of A be defined by an ideal J in A. Note J \neq 0. Let  f \in J with f \neq 0. Set R = A_f. Then R is a regular domain of dimension d. We show R contains naturally a field \ell \cong k((X)). Let \mathfrak{g} be the set of \ell-linear derivations of R and let D(R) be the subring of Hom_\ell(R,R) generated by \mathfrak{g} and the multiplication operators defined by elements in the ring R. We show that D(R), the ring of \ell-linear differential operators on R, is a left, right Noetherian ring of global dimension d. This enables us to prove Lyubeznik's conjecture on R modulo a conjecture on roots of Bernstein-Sato polynomials over power series rings.
