Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a Gorenstein local ring and let M, N be two Cohen-Macaulay \ A-modules with M linked to N via a Gorenstein ideal \mathfrak{q}.   Let L be another finitely generated A-module. We show that Ext^i_A(L,M) = 0  for all i \gg 0 if and only if Tor^A_i(L,N) = 0 for all i \gg 0. If D is Cohen-Macaulay then we show that Ext^i_A(M, D) = 0  for all i \gg 0 if and only if   Ext^i_A(D^\dagger, N) = 0 for all i \gg 0, where D^\dagger = Ext^r_A(D,A) and r = codim \ D.   As a consequence we get that Ext^i_A(M, M) = 0  for all i \gg 0 if and only if   Ext^i_A(N, N) = 0 for all i \gg 0.   We also show that End_A(M)/rad \ End_A(M) \cong (End_A(N)/rad \ End_A(N))^{op}. We also give a negative answer to a question of Martsinkovsky and Strooker.
