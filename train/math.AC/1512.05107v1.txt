In this paper we present an unexpected connection between the theory of asymptotic prime divisors and Chow groups. As an application we show that the Chow group A_1(R) is a torsion group when R is any graded ring such that we have an inclusion of graded rings T \subseteq R \subseteq S where S = k[X_1, X_2, Y]/(X_1^m + X_2^m + Y^n) where k is algebraically field, (m,n) = 1, (mn)^{-1} \in k, m, n \geq 2. We consider S graded with deg \ X_1 = deg \ X_2 = n and deg \ Y = m. Also T = k[X_1, X_2] where deg \ X_1 = deg \ X_2 = n. We also consider higher dimensional analogues of this result.
