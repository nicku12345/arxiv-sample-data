For a Noetherian regular ring S and for a fixed ideal J\subset S, assume that the associated primes of local cohomology module H^i_J(S) does not contain p for some i\geq 0, and we call this as a property \textit{\textbf{P}}^{i,p}_{J,S} or \textit{\textbf{P}} for brevity. Recently, in Theorem 1.2 of \cite{Nu1}, it is proved that in a Noetherian regular local ring S and for a fixed ideal J\subset S, associated primes of local cohomology module H^i_J(S) for i\geq 0 is finite, if it does not contain p. In this paper, we study how the property \textit{\textbf{P}} (as mentioned above) can come down from unramified regular ring to ramified regular local ring. In \cite{SW}, Bockstein homomorphism is studied in the context to the finiteness of associated primes of local cohomology modules for the ring of integers. There it is shown that if p is nonzero divisor of Koszul homology then Bockstein homomorphism is a zero map (see, Theorem 3.1 of \cite{SW}). Here, in this paper, as a consequence of property \textit{\textbf{P}}, we extend the result of Theorem 3.1 of \cite{SW} to the ramified regular local ring.
