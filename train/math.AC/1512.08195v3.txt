Given arbitrary monomial ideals I and J in polynomial rings A and B over a field K, we investigate the Stanley depth of powers of the sum I+J, and their quotient rings, in A\otimes_K B in terms of those of I and J. Our results can be used to study the asymptotic behavior of the Stanley depth of powers of a monomial ideal. For instance, we solved the case of monomial complete intersection.
