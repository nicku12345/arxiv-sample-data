For a simplicial complex \Delta, we introduce a simplicial complex attached to \Delta, called the expansion of \Delta, which is a natural generalization of the notion of expansion in graph theory. We are interested in knowing how the properties of a simplicial complex and its Stanley-Reisner ring relate to those of its expansions. It is shown that taking expansion preserves vertex decomposable and shellable properties and in some cases Cohen-Macaulayness. Also it is proved that some homological invariants of Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex relate to those invariants in the Stanley-Reisner ring of its expansions.
