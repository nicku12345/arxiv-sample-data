Let K be any field and x = (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n). We classify all matrices M \in {\rm Mat}_{m,n}(K[x]) whose entries are polynomials of degree at most 1, for which {\rm rk} M \le 2. As a special case, we describe all such matrices M, which are the Jacobian matrix J H (the matrix of partial derivatives) of a polynomial map H from K^n to K^m.   Among other things, we show that up to composition with linear maps over K, M = J H has only two nonzero columns or only three nonzero rows in this case. In addition, we show that {\rm trdeg}_K K(H) = {\rm rk} J H for quadratic polynomial maps H over K such that \frac12 \in K and {\rm rk} J H \le 2.   Furthermore, we prove that up to conjugation with linear maps over K, nilpotent Jacobian matrices N of quadratic polynomial maps, for which {\rm rk} N \le 2, are triangular (with zeroes on the diagonal), regardless of the characteristic of K. This generalizes several results by others.   In addition, we prove the same result for Jacobian matrices N of quadratic polynomial maps, for which N^2 = 0. This generalizes a result by others, namely the case where \frac12 \in K and N(0) = 0.
