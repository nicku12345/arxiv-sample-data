Let M be a module over a commutative ring R. In this paper, we continue our study of annihilating-submodule graph AG(M) which was introduced in (The Zariski topology-graph of modules over commutative rings, Comm. Algebra., 42 (2014), 3283{3296). AG(M) is a (undirected) graph in which a nonzero submodule N of M is a vertex if and only if there exists a nonzero proper submodule K of M such that NK = (0), where NK, the product of N and K, is defined by (N : M)(K : M)M and two distinct vertices N and K are adjacent if and only if NK = (0). We obtain useful characterizations for those modules M for which either AG(M) is a complete (or star) graph or every vertex of AG(M) is a prime (or maximal) submodule of M. Moreover, we study coloring of annihilating-submodule graphs.
