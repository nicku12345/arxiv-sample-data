For a polynomial map \mathbf{f} : k^n \to k^m (k a field), we investigate those polynomials g \in k[t_1,\ldots, t_n] that can be written as a composition g = h \circ \mathbf{f}, where h: k^m \to k is an arbitrary function. In the case that k is algebraically closed of characteristic 0 and \mathbf{f} is surjective, we will show that g = h \circ \mathbf{f} implies that h is a polynomial.
