We examine local cohomology in the setting of valuation rings. The novelty of this investigation stems from the fact that valuation rings are usually non-Noetherian, whereas local cohomology has been extensively developed mostly in a Noetherian setting. We prove various vanishing results on local cohomology for valuation rings of finite Krull dimension. These vanishing results stem from a uniform bound on the global dimension of such rings. Our investigation reveals differences in the sheaf theoretic definition of local cohomology, and the algebraic definition in terms of a limit of certain Ext functors.
