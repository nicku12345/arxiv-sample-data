We investigate resolutions of letterplace ideals of posets. We develop topological results to compute their multigraded Betti numbers, and to give structural results on these Betti numbers. If the poset is a union of no more than c chains, we show that the Betti numbers may be computed from simplicial complexes of no more than c vertices. We also give a recursive procedure to compute the Betti diagrams when the Hasse diagram of P has tree structure.
