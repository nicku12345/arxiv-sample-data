In \cite{AB}, the dagger closure is extended over finitely generated modules over Noetherian local domain (R,\fm) and it is proved to be a Dietz closure. In this short note we show that it also satisfies the `Algebra axiom' of \cite{R.G} and this leads to the following result of this paper: For a complete Noetherian local domain, if it is contained in an almost Cohen-Macaulay domain, then there exists a balanced big Cohen-Macaulay algebra over it.
