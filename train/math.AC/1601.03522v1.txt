We investigate, from a topological point of view, the classes of spectral semistar operations and of eab semistar operations, following methods recently introduced by Finocchiaro and Finocchiaro-Spirito in \cite{Fi, FiSp}. We show that, in both cases, the subspaces of finite type operations are spectral spaces in the sense of Hochster and, moreover, that there is a distinguished class of overrings strictly connected to each of the two types of collections of semistar operations. We also prove that the space of stable semistar operations is homeomorphic to the space of Gabriel-Popescu localizing systems, endowed with a Zariski-like topology, extending to the topological level a result established by Fontana-Huckaba in \cite{fohu}. As a side effect, we obtain that the space of localizing systems of finite type is also a spectral space. Finally, we show that the Zariski topology on the set of semistar operations is the same as the b-topology defined recently by B. Olberding \cite{ol, olb_noeth}.
