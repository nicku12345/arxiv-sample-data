We find conditions on the local cohomology modules of multi-Rees algebras of admissible filtrations which enable us to predict joint reduction numbers. As a consequence we are able to prove a generalisation of a result of Reid-Roberts-Vitulli in the setting of analytically unramified local rings for completeness of power products of complete ideals.
