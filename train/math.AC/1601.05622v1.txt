We study relationship between postulation and reduction vectors of admissible multigraded filtrations \mathcal F= \{\mathcal F (\underline n)\}_{\underline n\in\mathbb Z^s} of ideals in Cohen-Macaulay local rings of dimension at most two. This is enabled by a suitable generalisation of the Kirby-Mehran Complex. An analysis of its homology leads to an analogue of Huneke's Fundamental Lemma which plays a crucial role in our investigations. We also clarify the relationship between the Cohen-Macaulay property of the multigraded Rees algebra of \mathcal F and reduction vectors with respect to complete reductions of \mathcal F.
