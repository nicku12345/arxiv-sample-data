Let M be a module over a commutative ring R. In this paper, we continue our study of annihilating-submodule graph AG(M) which was introduced in (The Zariski topology-graph of modules over commutative rings, Comm. Algebra., 42 (2014), 3283{3296). AG(M) is a (undirected) graph in which a nonzero submodule N of M is a vertex if and only if there exists a nonzero proper submodule K of M such that NK = (0), where NK, the product of N and K, is defined by (N : M)(K : M)M and two distinct vertices N and K are adjacent if and only if NK = (0). We prove that if AG(M) is a tree, then either AG(M) is a star graph or a path of order 4 and in the latter case M\cong F\times ?S, where F is a simple module and S is a module with a unique non-trivial submodule. Moreover, we prove that if M is a cyclic module with at least three minimal prime submodules, then gr(AG(M)) = 3 and for every cyclic module M, cl(AG(M))\geq |Min(M)|.
