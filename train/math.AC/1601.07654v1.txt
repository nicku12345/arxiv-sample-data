AF-rings are algebras over a field k which satisfy the Altitude Formula over k. This paper surveys a few works in the literature on the Krull and valuative dimensions of tensor products of AF-rings. The first section extends Wadsworth's classical results on the Krull dimension of AF-domains to the larger class of AF-rings. It also provides formulas for computing the valuative dimension with effect on the transfer of the (locally) Jaffard property. The second section studies tensor products of AF-rings over a zero-dimensional ring. Most results on algebras over a field are extended to these general constructions. The third section establishes formulas for the Krull and valuative dimensions of tensor products of pullbacks issued from AF-domains. Throughout, examples are provided to illustrate the scope and limits of the results.
