This paper investigates ideal-theoretic as well as homological extensions of the Prufer domain concept to commutative rings with zero divisors in an amalgamated duplication of a ring along an ideal. The new results both compare and contrast with recent results on trivial ring extensions (and pullbacks) as well as yield original families of examples issued from amalgamated duplications subject to various Prufer conditions.
