The t-class semigroup of an integral domain is the semigroup of the isomorphy classes of the t-ideals with the operation induced by t-multiplication. This paper investigates integral domains with Boolean t-class semigroup with an emphasis on the GCD and stability conditions. The main results establish t-analogues for well-known results on Prufer domains and Bezout domains of finite character.
