Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring of prime characteristic p. In this paper we give a short proof using filter regular sequences that the set of associated prime ideals of H^t_I(R) is finite for any ideal I and for any t \ge 0 when R has finite F-representation type or finite singular locus. This extends a previous result by Takagi-Takahashi and gives affirmative answers for a problem of Huneke in many new classes of rings in positive characteristic. We also give a criterion about the singularities of R (in any characteristic) to guarantee that the set of associated primes of H^2_I(R) is always finite.
