In this paper, we define generalized symmetric derivations on K\"{a}hler modules. We give the relationships between the projective dimensions of \Omega^{(1)}(R/k) and \Omega^{(2)}(R/k) by using the symmetric derivation.We then give some interesting results by using this definition and related to K\"{a}hler modules and symmetric derivations.
