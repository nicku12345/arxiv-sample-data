Let A be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with \operatorname{dim} A = d\ge 3, possessing the canonical module {\mathrm K}_A. Let a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r (3 \le r \le d) be a subsystem of parameters of A and set Q= (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r). It is shown that if the Rees algebra {\mathcal R}(Q) of Q is an almost Gorenstein graded ring, then A is a regular local ring and a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r is a part of a regular system of parameters of A.
