We give a short proof of a result due to Katz and West: Let R be a Noetherian ring and I_1,\ldots,I_t ideals of R. Let M and N be finitely generated R-modules and N' \subseteq N a submodule. For every fixed i \ge 0, the sets \mathrm{Ass}_R\left( \mathrm{Ext}_R^i(M, N/I_1^{n_1}\cdots I_t^{n_t} N') \right) and \mathrm{Ass}_R\left( \mathrm{Tor}_i^R(M, N/I_1^{n_1}\cdots I_t^{n_t} N') \right) are independent of (n_1,\ldots,n_t) for all sufficiently large n_1,\ldots,n_t.
