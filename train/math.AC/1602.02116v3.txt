Let R=S/I be a graded algebra with t_i and T_i being the minimal and maximal shifts in the minimal S resolution of R at degree i. In this paper we prove that t_n\leq t_1+T_{n-1}, for all n and as a consequence, we show that for Gorenstein algebras of codimension h, the subadditivity of maximal shifts T_i in the minimal resolution holds for i \geq h-1, i.e, we show that T_i \leq T_a+T_{i-a} for i\geq h-1.
