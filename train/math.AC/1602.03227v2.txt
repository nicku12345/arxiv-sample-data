We continue our work on adic semidualizing complexes over a commutative noetherian ring R by investigating the associated Auslander and Bass classes (collectively known as Foxby classes), following Foxby and Christensen. Fundamental properties of these classes include Foxby Equivalence, which provides an equivalence between the Auslander and Bass classes associated to a given adic semidualizing complex. We prove a variety of stability results for these classes, for instance, with respect to F\otimes^{\mathbf{L}}_R- where F is an R-complex finite flat dimension, including special converses of these results. We also investigate change of rings and local-global properties of these classes.
