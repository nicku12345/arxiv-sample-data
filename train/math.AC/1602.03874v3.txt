We prove two results about the derived functor of a-adic completion: (1) Let K be a commutative noetherian ring, let A be a flat noetherian K-algebra which is a-adically complete with respect to some ideal a\subseteq A, such that A/a is essentially of finite type over K, and let M,N be finitely generated A-modules. Then adic reduction to the diagonal holds: A\otimes^{L}_{ A\hat{\otimes}_{K} A } ( M\hat{\otimes}^{L}_{K} N ) \cong M \otimes^{L}_A N. A similar result is given in the case where M,N are not necessarily finitely generated. (2) Let A be a commutative ring, let a\subseteq A be a weakly proregular ideal, let M be an A-module, and assume that the a-adic completion of A is noetherian (if A is noetherian, all these conditions are always satisfied). Then \mbox{Ext}^i_A(A/a,M) is finitely generated for all i\ge 0 if and only if the derived a-adic completion \L\hat{\Lambda}_{a}(M) has finitely generated cohomologies over \hat{A}. The first result is a far reaching generalization of a result of Serre, who proved this in case K is a field or a discrete valuation ring and A = K[[x_1,\dots,x_n]].
