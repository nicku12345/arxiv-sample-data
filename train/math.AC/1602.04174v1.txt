In this paper we will investigate commutative rings which have the \ast -property. We say that a ring R satisfy \ast-property if for any family of ideals \left\{ I_{\alpha}\right\} _{\alpha\in S} of R in which S is an index set, there exists a finite subset\ S^{\prime} of S such that the radical of the intersection of the family of ideals \left\{ I_{\alpha}\right\} _{\alpha\in S} is equal to the intersection of the radicals of ideals \left\{ I_{\alpha}\right\} _{\alpha\in S^{\prime}} . We will show that any integral domain which satisfy \ast-property is a field. Furthermore, these rings are zero-dimensional. After this we give relations between these rings and Artinian rings.
