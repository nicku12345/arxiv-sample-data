Given a graded complete intersection ideal J = (f_1, \dots, f_c) \subseteq k[x_0, \dots, x_n] = S, where k is a field of characteristic p > 0 such that [k:k^p] < \infty, we show that if S/J has an isolated non-F-pure point then the Frobenius action on top local cohomology H^{n+1-c}_\mathfrak{m}(S/J) is injective in sufficiently negative degrees, and we compute the least degree of any kernel element. If S/J has an isolated singularity, we are also able to give an effective bound on p ensuring the Frobenius action on H^{n+1-c}_\mathfrak{m}(S/J) is injective in all negative degrees, extending a result of Bhatt and Singh in the hypersurface case.
