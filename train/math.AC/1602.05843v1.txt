Let k be a field and x,y indeterminates over k. Let R=k[x^a,x^{p_1}y^{s_1},\ldots,x^{p_t}y^{s_t},y^b] \subseteq k[x,y]. We calculate the Hilbert polynomial of (x^a,y^b). The multiplicity of this ideal provides part of a criterion for the ring to be Cohen-Macaulay. Next, we prove a simple numerical criterion for R to be Cohen-Macaulay in the case when t=2. We also provide a simple algorithm which identifies the monomial k-basis of R/(x^a,y^b). Finally, these simple results are specialized to the case of projective monomial curves in \mathbb{P}^3.
