Let G be a connected finite simple graph and let I_G be the edge ideal of G. The smallest number k for which \depth S/I_G^k stabilizes is denoted by \dstab(I_G). We show that \dstab(I_G)<\ell(I_G) where \ell(I_G) denotes the analytic spread of I. For trees we give a stronger upper bound for \dstab(I_G). We also show for any two integers 1\leq a<b there exists a tree for which \dstab(I_G)=a and \ell(I_G)=b.
