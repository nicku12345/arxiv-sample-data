All rings are commutative with 1\neq0. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the concept of weakly n-absorbing ideals generalizing weakly 2-absorbing ideals. We prove that over a u-ring R the Anderson-Badawi's conjectures about n-absorbing ideals and the Badawi-Yousefian's question about weakly 2-absorbing ideals hold.
