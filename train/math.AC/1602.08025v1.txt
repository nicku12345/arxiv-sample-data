In this paper we study the behavior of the size of a monomial ideal under polarization and under generic deformations. As an application, we extend a result relating the size and the Stanley depth of a squarefree monomial ideal obtained by Herzog, Popescu and Vladoiu, together with a parallel result obtained by Tang.
