Motivated by the notion of geometrically linked ideals, we show that over a Gorenstein local ring R, if a Cohen-Macaulay R-module M of grade g is linked to an R-module N by a Gorenstein ideal c, such that Ass_R(M)\cap Ass_R(N)=\emptyset, then M\otimes_RN is isomorphic to direct sum of copies of R/a, where a is a Gorenstein ideal of R of grade g+1. We give a criterion for the depth of a local ring (R,m,k) in terms of the homological dimensions of the modules linked to the syzygies of the residue field k. As a result we characterize a local ring (R,m,k) in terms of the homological dimensions of the modules linked to the syzygies of k.
