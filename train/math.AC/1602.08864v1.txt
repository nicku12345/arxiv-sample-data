Let K be a field, V a K-vector space with basis e_1,\ldots,e_n, and E the exterior algebra of V. To a given monomial ideal I\subsetneq E we associate a special monomial ideal J with generators in the same degrees as those of I and such that the number of the minimal monomial generators in each degree of I and J coincide. We call J the colexsegment ideal associated to I. We prove that the class of strongly stable ideals in E generated in one degree satisfies the colex lower bound, that is, the total Betti numbers of the colexsegment ideal associated to a strongly stable ideal I\subsetneq E generated in one degree are smaller than or equal to those of I.
