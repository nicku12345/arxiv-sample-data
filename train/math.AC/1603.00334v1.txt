In this note we introduce and study basic properties of two types of modules over a commutative noetherian ring R of positive prime characteristic. The first is the category of modules of finite F-type. These objects include reflexive ideals representing torsion elements in the divisor class group of R. The second class is what we call F-abundant modules. These include, for example, the ring R itself and the canonical module when R has positive splitting dimension. We prove various facts about these two categories and how they are related, for example that \mathrm{Hom}_R(M,N) is maximal Cohen-Macaulay when M is of finite F-type and N is F-abundant, plus some extra (but necessary) conditions. Our methods allow us to extend previous results by Patakfalvi-Schwede, Yao and Watanabe. They also afford a deeper understanding of these objects, including complete classifications in many cases of interest, such as complete intersections and invariant subrings.
