In this note we first give a new bound on e_{HK}(\sim) the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of invariant rings, by the help of the Noether's bound. Then, we simplify, extend and present applications of the reciprocity formulae due to L. Smith. He proved the formula over polynomial rings and his result is tight in the following sense: Over complete intersection rings with isolated singularity we show that the reciprocity formulae "e_{HK}(R/I)+ e_{HK}(R/J) = e_{HK}(R/\underline{f})" is equivalent with \pd(I)<\infty when I is an \fm-primary unmixed ideal linked to J along with a regular sequence \underline{f}.
