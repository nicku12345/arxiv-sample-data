Consider a non-trivial fiber product R=S\times_kT of local rings S, T with common residue field k. Given two finitely generate R-modules M and N, we show that if \operatorname{Tor}^R_i(M,N)=0=\operatorname{Tor}^R_{i+1}(M,N) for some i\geq 5, then \operatorname{pd}_R(M)\leq 1 or \operatorname{pd}_R(N)\leq 1. From this, we deduce several consequence, for instance, that R satisfies the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture.
