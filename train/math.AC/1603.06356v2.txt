Let H be a Krull monoid with class group G. Then H is factorial if and only if G is trivial. Sets of lengths and sets of catenary degrees are well studied invariants describing the arithmetic of H in the non-factorial case. In this note we focus on the set Ca (H) of catenary degrees of H and on the set \mathcal R (H) of distances in minimal relations. We show that every finite nonempty subset of \mathbb N_{\ge 2} can be realized as the set of catenary degrees of a Krull monoid with finite class group. This answers Problem 4.1 of {arXiv:1506.07587}. Suppose in addition that every class of G contains a prime divisor. Then Ca (H)\subset \mathcal R (H) and \mathcal R (H) contains a long interval. Under a reasonable condition on the Davenport constant of G, \mathcal R (H) coincides with this interval and the maximum equals the catenary degree of H.
