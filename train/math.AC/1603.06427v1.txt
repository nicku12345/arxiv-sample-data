The symmetric signature is an invariant of local domains which was recently introduced by Brenner and the first author in an attempt to find a replacement for the F-signature in characteristic zero. In the present note we compute the symmetric signature for two-dimensional cyclic quotient singularities, i.e. invariant subrings k[[u,v]]^G of rings of formal power series under the action of a cyclic group G. Equivalently, these rings arise as the completions (at the irrelevant ideal) of two-dimensional normal toric rings. We show that for this class of rings the symmetric signature coincides with the F-signature.
