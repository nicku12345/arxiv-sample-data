Let R be a regular local ring containing a field k of characteristic p and M be an \mathscr{F}-finite module. In this paper, we study the injective dimension of M. We prove that \operatorname{dim}_R(M) -1 \leq\operatorname{inj.dim}_R(M). If R = k[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]] where k is a field of characteristic 0 we prove the analogous result for a class of holonomic \mathscr{D}-modules which contains local cohomology modules.
