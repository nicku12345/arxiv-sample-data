Let (R, \mathfrak m) be a commutative noetherian local ring. We investigate under which conditions an R-module M is generated by an ideal I, i.e. there exists an epimorphism I^{(\Lambda)} \twoheadrightarrow M. If M is uniserial, i.e. \mathcal{L}(M) is totally ordered and finite, this is equivalent to \mathfrak{m}^{n-1} \cdot I \not\subset \operatorname{Ann}_R(M) \cdot I (\operatorname{length}(M) = n \geq 1). If M is cyclic and I = \mathfrak{m}, this is equivalent to: Either it is M \cong R/\mathfrak{p} (R/\mathfrak{p} a discrete valuation ring) or M \cong C/\operatorname{So}(C) (C a uniserial R-module). If A is free and B is a submodule of A, then the Matlis dual (A/B)^{\circ} = operatorname{Hom}_R(A/B, E) is I-generated if and only if B = (IB) :_A I. In the case I = \mathfrak{m}, this condition leads to the "basically full ideals" considered by Heinzer, Ratliff~Jr. and Rush. By studying the dual condition M = I(M :_X I) in the last section, we can generalize some results of that work.
