This paper contributes to the study of homological aspects of trivial ring extensions (also called Nagata idealizations). Namely, we investigate the transfer of the notion of (Matlis') semi-regular ring (also known as IF-ring) along with related concepts, such as coherence, in trivial ring extensions issued from integral domains. All along the paper, we put the new results in use to enrich the literature with new families of examples subject to semi-regularity.
