Let R be a factorial domain. In this work we investigate the connections between the arithmetic of {\rm Int}(R) (i.e., the ring of integer-valued polynomials over R) and its monadic submonoids (i.e., monoids of the form \{g\in {\rm Int}(R)\mid g\mid_{{\rm Int}(R)} f^k for some k\in\mathbb{N}_0\} for some nonzero f\in {\rm Int}(R)). Since every monadic submonoid of {\rm Int}(R) is a Krull monoid it is possible to describe the arithmetic of these monoids in terms of their divisor-class group. We give an explicit description of these divisor-class groups in several situations and provide a few techniques that can be used to determine them. As an application we show that there are strong connections between {\rm Int}(R) and its monadic submonoids. If R=\mathbb{Z} or more generally if R has sufficiently many "nice" atoms, then we prove that the infinitude of the elasticity and the tame degree of {\rm Int}(R) can be explained by using the structure of monadic submonoids of {\rm Int}(R).
