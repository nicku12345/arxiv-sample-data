Let T be a complete equicharacteristic local (Noetherian) UFD of dimension 3 or greater. Assuming that |T| = |T/m|, where m is the maximal ideal of T, we construct a local UFD A whose completion is T and whose formal fibers at height one prime ideals have prescribed dimension between zero and the dimension of the generic formal fiber. If, in addition, T is regular and has characteristic zero, we can construct A to be excellent.
