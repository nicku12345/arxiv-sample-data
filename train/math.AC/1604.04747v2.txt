The question of when the Rees algebra {\mathcal R} (I)= \bigoplus_{n \ge 0}I^n of I is an almost Gorenstein graded ring is explored, where R is a two-dimensional regular local ring and I a contracted ideal of R. It is known that {\mathcal R} (I) is an almost Gorenstein graded ring for every integrally closed ideal I of R. The main results of the present paper show that if I is a contracted ideal with \mathrm{o}(I) \le 2, then {\mathcal R} (I) is an almost Gorenstein graded ring, while if \mathrm{o}(I) \ge 3, then {\mathcal R} (I) is not necessarily an almost Gorenstein graded ring, even though I is a contracted stable ideal. Thus both affirmative answers and negative answers are given.
