In this paper we study the Lefschetz properties of monomial complete intersections in positive characteristic. We give a complete classification of the strong Lefschetz property when the number of variables is at least three, which proves a conjecture by Cook II. We also extend earlier results on the weak Lefschetz property by dropping the assumption on the residue field being infinite, and by giving new sufficient criteria.
