The set of distances of a monoid or of a domain is the set of all d \in \mathbb N with the following property: there are irreducible elements u_1, \ldots, u_k, v_1, \ldots, v_{k+d} such that u_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot u_k = v_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot v_{k+d}, but u_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot u_k cannot be written as a product of l irreducible elements for any l with k < l < k+d. We show that the set of distances is an interval for certain seminormal weakly Krull monoids which include seminormal orders in holomorphy rings of global fields.
