In preparing the paper "Some extensions of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity", we had occasion to perform an intricate set of computations pertaining to a single illustrative example. In the end, we have decided not to include the computations in the main paper, but instead to publish them here for later reference. In particular, the current preprint gives an example where the converse to one of our main theorems holds, even though it does not fit into any of the previously known cases where a converse holds.
