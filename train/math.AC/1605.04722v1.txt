Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. Recently, Dibaei and Sadeghi have studied the reduced grade of a horizontally linked R-module M of finite GC-dimension, where C is a semidualizing R-module. In this paper, we highly refine their results. In particular, our main result removes the assumptions that M is holizontally linked and M has finite GC -dimension.
