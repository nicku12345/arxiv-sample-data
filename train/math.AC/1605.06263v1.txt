Assume that K is a field and I_{1}\subsetneq ...\subsetneq I_{t} is an ascending chain (of length t) of ideals in the polynomial ring K[x_{1},,...,x_{m}], for some m\geq 1. Suppose that I_{j} is generated by polynomials of degrees less or equal to some natural number f(j)\geq 1, for any j=1,...,t. In the paper we construct, in an elementary way, a natural number \mathcal{B}(m,f) (depending on m and the function f) such that t\leq\mathcal{B}(m,f). We also discuss some possible applications of this result.
