We consider a finite dimensional \kk G-module V of a p-group G over a field \kk of characteristic p. We describe a generating set for the corresponding Hilbert Ideal. In case G is cyclic this yields that the algebra \kk[V]_G of coinvariants is a free module over its subalgebra generated by \kk G-module generators of V^*. This subalgebra is a quotient of a polynomial ring by pure powers of its variables. The coinvariant ring was known to have this property only when G was cyclic of prime order, \cite{SezerCoinv}. In addition, we show that if G is the Klein 4-group and V does not contain an indecomposable summand isomorphic to the regular module, then the Hilbert Ideal is a complete intersection, extending a result of the second author and R.
