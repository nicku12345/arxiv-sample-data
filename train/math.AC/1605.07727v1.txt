We prove the subadditivity property for the maximal degrees of the syzygies of facet ideals simplicial forests. For such an ideal I, if the i-th Betti number is nonzero and i=a+b, we show that there are monomials in the lcm lattice of I that are complements in part of the lattice, each supporting a nonvanishing a-th and b-th Betti numbers. The subadditivity formula follows from this observation.
