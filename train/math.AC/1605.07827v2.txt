Let \mathcal{H} be the Hermitian curve defined over a finite field \mathbb{F}_{q^2}. In this paper we complete the geometrical characterization of the supports of the minimum-weight codewords of the algebraic-geometry codes over \mathcal{H}, started in [1]: if d is the distance of the code, the supports are all the sets of d distinct \mathbb{F}_{q^2}-points on \mathcal{H} complete intersection of two curves defined by polynomials with prescribed initial monomials w.r.t. \texttt{DegRevLex}.   For most Hermitian codes, and especially for all those with distance d\geq q^2-q studied in [1], one of the two curves is always the Hermitian curve \mathcal{H} itself, while if d<q the supports are complete intersection of two curves none of which can be \mathcal{H}.   Finally, for some special codes among those with intermediate distance between q and q^2-q, both possibilities occur.   We provide simple and explicit numerical criteria that allow to decide for each code what kind of supports its minimum-weight codewords have and to obtain a parametric description of the family (or the two families) of the supports.
