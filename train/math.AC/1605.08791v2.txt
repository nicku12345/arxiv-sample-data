Given a d \times n integer matrix A, the main result is an elementary, simple-to-state algorithm that finds the largest A-graded ideal contained in any ideal I in a polynomial ring \Bbbk[x_1,\ldots,x_n]. The special case where A is an identity matrix yields that (t.I) \cap \Bbbk[x_1,\ldots,x_n] is the largest monomial ideal in I, where the generators of t.I are those of I but with each variable x_i replaced by t_i x_i for an invertible variable t_i.
