In this paper we prove that, if \mathbb{k} is an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2, almost all quadratic standard graded \mathbb{k}-algebras R such that \dim_{\mathbb{k}}R_2 = 3 are Koszul. More precisely, up to graded \mathbb{k}-algebra homomorphisms and trivial fiber extensions, we find out that only two (or three, when the characteristic of \mathbb{k} is 3) algebras of this kind are non-Koszul.   Moreover, we show that there exist nontrivial quadratic standard graded \mathbb{k}-algebras with \dim_{\mathbb{k}}R_1 = 4, \dim_{\mathbb{k}}R_2 = 3 that are Koszul but do not admit a Gr\"obner basis of quadrics even after a change of coordinates, thus settling in the negative a question asked by Conca.
