Let f: \mathbb{C}[x,y] \to \mathbb{C}[x,y] be a \mathbb{C}-algebra endomorphism having an invertible Jacobian. We show that for such f, if, in addition, the group of invertible elements of \mathbb{C}[f(x),f(y),x][1/v] \subset \mathbb{C}(x,y) is contained in \mathbb{C}(f(x),f(y))-0, then f is an automorphism. Here v \in \mathbb{C}[f(x),f(y)]-0 is such that y = u/v, with u \in \mathbb{C}[f(x),f(y),x]-0. Keller's theorem (in dimension two) follows immediately, since Keller's condition \mathbb{C}(f(x),f(y))=\mathbb{C}(x,y) implies that the group of invertible elements of \mathbb{C}[f(x),f(y),x][1/v] is contained in \mathbb{C}(x,y)-0 = \mathbb{C}(f(x),f(y))-0.
