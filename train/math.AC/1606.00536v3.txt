We investigate injective dimension of F-finite F-modules in characteristic p and holonomic D-modules in characteristic 0. One of our main results is the following. If, either R is a regular ring of finite type over an infinite field of characteristic p>0 and M is an F_R-finite F_R-module, or R=k[x_1,\dots,x_n] where k is a field of characteristic 0 and M is a holonomic D(R,k)-module, then the injective dimension of M is the same as the dimension of its support.
