In [HSS], Conjecture 5.5.2, Harbourne, Schenck and Seceleanu conjectured that, for r=6 and all r\ge 8, the artinian ideal I=(\ell _1^2,\dots ,l_{r+1}^2)\subset K[x_1, \dots ,x_r] generated by the square of r+1 general linear forms \ell _{i} fails the Weak Lefschetz property. This paper is entirely devoted to prove this Conjecture. It is worthwhile to point out that half of the Conjecture - namely, the case when the number of variables r is even - was already proved in [mmn], Theorem 6.1.
