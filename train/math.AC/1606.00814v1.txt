Let R be a Noetherian ring, I an ideal of R and M an R-module. In this article, we examine the question of whether an arbitrary top local cohomology module, \operatorname{H}^{\operatorname{cd}(I,M)}_I(M), is Artinian, or not. Several results related to this question are obtained; in particular, we prove that over a Noetherian local unique factorization domain R of dimension three, for a finitely generated faithful module M, a top local cohomology module is Artinian if and only if \operatorname{cd}(I,M)= 3.
