Let I_X be the saturated homogeneous ideal defining a codimension two arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n, and let I_X^{(m)} denote its m-th symbolic power. We are interested in when I_X^{(m)} = I_X^m. We survey what is known about this problem when X is locally a complete intersection, and in particular, we review the classification of when I_X^{(m)} = I_X^m for all m \geq 1. We then discuss how one might weaken these hypotheses, but still obtain equality between the symbolic and ordinary powers. Finally, we show that this classification allows one to: (1) simplify known results about symbolic powers of ideals of points in \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1; (2) verify a conjecture of Guardo, Harbourne, and Van Tuyl, and (3) provide additional evidence to a conjecture of R\"omer.
