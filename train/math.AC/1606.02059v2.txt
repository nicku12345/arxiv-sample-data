Let (R,m) be a Noetherian local ring of characteristic p>0. We introduce and study F-full and F-anti-nilpotent singularities, both are defined in terms of the Frobenius actions on the local cohomology modules of R supported at the maximal ideal. We prove that if R/(x) is F-full or F-anti-nilpotent for a nonzerodivisor x\in R, then so is R. We use these results to obtain new cases on the deformation of F-injectivity.
