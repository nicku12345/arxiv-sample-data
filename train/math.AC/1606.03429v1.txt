Let R be a graded ring. We introduce a class of graded R-modules called Gr\"obner-coherent modules. Roughly, these are graded R-modules that are coherent as ungraded modules because they admit an adequate theory of Gr\"obner bases. The class of Gr\"obner-coherent modules is formally similar to the class of coherent modules: for instance, it is an abelian category closed under extension. However, Gr\"obner-coherent modules come with tools for effective computation that are not present for coherent modules.
