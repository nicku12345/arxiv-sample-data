The two-dimensional Jacobian Conjecture says that a \mathbb{C}-algebra endomorphism F:\mathbb{C}[x,y] \to \mathbb{C}[x,y] that has an invertible Jacobian is an automorphism. We show that if a \mathbb{C}-algebra endomorphism F:\mathbb{C}[x,y] \to \mathbb{C}[x,y] has an invertible Jacobian and if v \in \mathbb{C}[F(x),F(y),x] is a product of prime elements of \mathbb{C}[F(x),F(y),x], then F is an automorphism, where v is such that y = u/v, where u \in \mathbb{C}[F(x),F(y),x].
