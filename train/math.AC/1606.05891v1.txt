We relate the set of complete reduction vectors of a \mathbb{Z}^s-graded admissible filtration of ideals \mathcal{F} with the set of multigraded regularities of G(\mathcal{F}). We prove reg(G(\mathcal{F}))=reg(\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{F})). We establish a relation between the sets of complete reduction vectors of \mathcal{F} and postulation vectors of \mathcal{F} under some cohomological conditions.
