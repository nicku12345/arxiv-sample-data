Let R be the polynomial ring K[x_{i,j}] where 1 \le i \le r and j \in \mathbb{N}, and let I be an ideal of R stable under the natural action of the infinite symmetric group S_{\infty}. Nagel--R\"omer recently defined a Hilbert series H_I(s,t) of I and proved that it is rational. We give a much shorter proof of this theorem using tools from the theory of formal languages and a simple algorithm that computes the series.
