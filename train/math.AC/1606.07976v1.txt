Let R be a commutative local ring. We study the subcategory of the homotopy category of R-complexes consisting of the totally acyclic R-complexes. In particular, in the context where Q\to R is a surjective local ring homomorphism such that R has finite projective dimension over Q, we define an adjoint pair of functors between the homotopy category of totally acyclic R-complexes and that of Q-complexes, which are analogous to the classical adjoint pair between the module categories of R and Q. We give detailed proofs of the adjunction in terms of the unit and counit. As a consequence, one obtains a precise notion of approximations of totally acyclic R-complexes by totally acyclic Q-complexes.
