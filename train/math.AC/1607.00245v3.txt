The growth of tropical geometry has generated significant interest in the tropical semiring in the past decade. However, there are other semirings in tropical algebra that provide more information, such as the symmetrized (max, +), Izhakian-Rowen's extended and supertropical semirings. In this paper we identify in which of these upper-bound semirings we can express symmetric polynomials in terms of elementary ones. This allows us to determine the tropical algebra semirings where an analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials holds and to what extent.
