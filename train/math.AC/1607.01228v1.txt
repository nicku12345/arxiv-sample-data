Let S = k[x_{11}, \cdots, x_{1b_1}, \cdots, x_{n1}, \cdots, x_{nb_n}] be a polynomial ring in m = b_1 + \cdots + b_n variables over a field k. For all j, 1\le j \le n, let P_j be the prime ideal generated by variables \{x_{j1}, \cdots, x_{jb_j}\} and let I_{n, t} = \sum_{1\le j_1< \cdots <j_t\le n} P_{j_1}\ldots P_{j_t} be the transversal monomial ideal of degree t on P_1, \cdots, P_n. We explicitly construct a canonical polytopal \mathbb{Z}^t-graded minimal free resolution for the ideal I_{n, t} by means of suitable gluing of polytopes.
