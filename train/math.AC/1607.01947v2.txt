This paper shows the existence of ideals whose localizations and completions at prime ideals are parameter test ideals of the localized and completed rings. We do this for Cohen-Macaulay localizations (resp., completions) of non-local rings, for generalized Cohen-Macaulay rings, and for non-local rings with isolated non Cohen-Macaulay points, each being an isolated non F-rational point. The tools used to prove this results are constructive in nature and as a consequence our results yield algorithms for the computation of these global parameter test ideals.   Finally, we illustrate the power of our methods by analyzing the HSL numbers of local cohomology modules with support at any prime ideal.
