In this article first we develop the Gabriel localizations (abbreviated as G-localizations) for commutative rings, specially some new results in this direction are proven. Then, as an application, it is shown that a ring map is a flat epimorphism if and only if it corresponds to a kind of the G-localizations. As a by-product of this study, a characterization for the flatness of the quotient rings is given. The exactness of the G-localization functor are characterized. The structure of prime ideals in the G-localization rings are also studied. Finally, it is shown that the Gabriel localization theory is a natural generalization of the usual localization theory.
