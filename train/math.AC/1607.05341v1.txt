Let I be a regular proper ideal in a Noetherian ring R, let e \ge 2 be an integer, let \mathbf T_e = R[u,tI,u^{\frac{1}{e}}]' \cap R[u^{\frac{1}{e}},t^{\frac{1}{e}}] (where t is an indeterminate and u =\frac{1}{t}), and let \mathbf r_e = u^{\frac{1}{e}} \mathbf T_e. Then the Itoh (e)-valuation rings of I are the rings (\mathbf T_e/z)_{(p/z)}, where p varies over the (height one) associated prime ideals of \mathbf r_e and z is the (unique) minimal prime ideal in \mathbf T_e that is contained in p. We show, among other things:   (1) \mathbf r_e is a radical ideal if and only if e is a common multiple of the Rees integers of I.   (2) For each integer k \ge 2, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the Itoh (k)-valuation rings (V^*,N^*) of I and the Rees valuation rings (W,Q) of uR[u,tI]; namely, if F(u) is the quotient field of W, then V^* is the integral closure of W in F(u^{\frac{1}{k}}).   (3) For each integer k \ge 2, if (V^*,N^*) and (W,Q) are corresponding valuation rings, as in (2), then V^* is a finite integral extension domain of W, and W and V^* satisfy the Fundamental Equality with no splitting. Also, if uW = Q^e, and if the greatest common divisor of e and k is d, and c is the integer such that cd = k, then QV^* = {N^*}^c and [(V^*/N^*):(W/Q)] = d. Further, if uW = Q^e and k = qe is a multiple of e, then there exists a unit \theta_{e} \in V^* such that V^* = W[\theta_{e},u^{\frac{1}{k}}] is a finite free integral extension domain of W, QV^* = {N^*}^q, N^* = u^{\frac{1}{k}}V^*, and [V^*:W] = k.   (4) If the Rees integers of I are all equal to e, then V^* = W[\theta_e] is a simple free integral extension domain of W, QV^* = N^* = u^{\frac{1}{e}}V^*, and [V^*:W] = e = [(V^*/N^*):(W/Q)].
