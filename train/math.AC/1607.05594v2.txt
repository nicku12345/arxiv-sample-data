We define a notion of compressed local Artinian ring that does not require the ring to contain a field. Let (R,\mathfrak m) be a compressed local Artinian ring with odd top socle degree s, at least five, and \operatorname{socle}(R)\cap \mathfrak m^{s-1}=\mathfrak m^s. We prove that the Poincar\'e series of all finitely generated modules over R are rational, sharing a common denominator, and that there is a Golod homomorphism from a complete intersection onto R.
