Let (A,{\mathfrak m}) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring and let I be an ideal of A. We prove that the Rees algebra {\mathcal R}(I) is an almost Gorenstein ring in the following cases: (1) (A,{\mathfrak m}) is a two-dimensional excellent Gorenstein normal domain over an algebraically closed field K \cong A/{\mathfrak m} and I is a p_g-ideal; (2) (A,{\mathfrak m}) is a two-dimensional almost Gorenstein local ring having minimal multiplicity and I={\mathfrak m}^{\ell} for all \ell \ge 1; (3) (A,{\mathfrak m}) is a regular local ring of dimension d \ge 2 and I={\mathfrak m}^{d-1}. Conversely, if {\mathcal R}({\mathfrak m}^{\ell}) is an almost Gorenstein graded ring for some \ell \ge 2 and d \ge 3, then \ell=d-1.
