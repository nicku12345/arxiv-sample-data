Given a nonincreasing function f : \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \setminus \{ 0 \} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} such that (i) f(k) - f(k+1) \leq 1 for all k \geq 1 and (ii) if a = f(1) and b = \lim_{k \to \infty} f(k), then |f^{-1}(a)| \leq |f^{-1}(a-1)| \leq \cdots \leq |f^{-1}(b+1)|, a system of generators of a monomial ideal I \subset K[x_1, \ldots, x_n] for which {\rm depth} S/I^k = f(k) for all k \geq 1 is explicitly described. Furthermore, we give a characterization of triplets of integers (n,d,r) with n > 0, d \geq 0 and r > 0 with the properties that there exists a monomial ideal I \subset S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n] for which \lim_{k \to \infty} {\rm depth} S/I^k = d and {\rm dstab}(I) = r, where {\rm dstab}(I) is the smallest integer k_0 \geq 1 with {\rm depth} S/I^{k_0} = {\rm depth} S/I^{k_0+1} = {\rm depth} S/I^{k_0+2} = \cdots.
