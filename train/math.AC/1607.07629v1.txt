Let I denote an ideal of a Noetherian ring R and N a non-zero finitely generated R-module. In the present paper, some necessary and sufficient conditions are given to determine when the I-adic topology on N is equivalent to the I-symbolic topology on N. Among other things, we shall give a complete solution to the question raised by R. Hartshorne in [{\it Affine duality and cofiniteness}, Invent. Math. {\bf9}(1970), 145-164], for a prime ideal \frak p of dimension one in a local Noetherian ring R, by showing that the \frak{p}-adic topology on N is equivalent to the \frak{p}-symbolic topology on N if and only if for all z\in \Ass_{R^*}N^* there exists \frak{q}\in \Supp(N^*) such that z\subseteq \frak{q} and \frak{q}\cap R=\frak{p}. Also, it is shown that if for every {\mathfrak{p}}\in \Supp(N) with \dim R/\mathfrak{p}=1, the \mathfrak{p}-adic and the \mathfrak{p}-symbolic topologies are equivalent on N, then N is unmixed and \Ass_{R} N has only one element. Finally, we show that if \Ass_{R_{\mathfrak{p}}^*}{N^*_{\mathfrak{p}}} consists of a single prime ideal, for all {\mathfrak{p}}\in {A^*}(I,N), then the I-adic and the I-symbolic topologies on N are equivalent. \end{abstract}
