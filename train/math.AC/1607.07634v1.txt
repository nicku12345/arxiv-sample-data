Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, and let N be a non-zero finitely generated R-module. In this paper, the main result asserts that for any N-proper ideal \frak a of R, the \frak a-symbolic topology on N is linearly equivalent to the \frak a-adic topology on N if and only if, for every \frak p\in \Supp(N), \Ass_{R_{\mathfrak {p} }}N_{\mathfrak {p}} consists of a single prime ideal and \dim N\leq 1.
