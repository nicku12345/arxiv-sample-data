Let \bar{I} denote the integral closure of an ideal in a Noetherian ring R. The main result of this paper asserts that R is locally quasi-unmixed if and only if, the topologies defined by \overline{I^n} and I^{\langle n\rangle}, \ n\geq 1, are equivalent. In addition, some results about the behavior of linearly equivalent topologies of ideals under various ring homomorphisms are included.
