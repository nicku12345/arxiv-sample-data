The ring of integer-valued polynomials on an arbitrary integral domain is well-studied. In this paper we initiate and provide motivation for the study of integer-valued polynomials on commutative rings and modules. Several examples are computed, including the integer-valued polynomials over the ring R[T_1,\ldots, T_n]/(T_1(T_1-r_1), \ldots, T_n(T_n-r_n)) for any commutative ring R and any elements r_1, \ldots, r_n of R, as well as the integer-valued polynomials over the Nagata idealization R(+)M of M over R, where M is an R-module such that every non-zerodivisor on M is a non-zerodivisor of R.
