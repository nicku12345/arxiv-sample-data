In this paper, we study the atomic structure of Puiseux monoids generated by monotone sequences. To understand this atomic structure, it is often useful to know whether the monoid has a bounded generating set. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the atomicity and boundedness to be transferred from a monotone Puiseux monoid to all its submonoids. Finally, we present two special subfamilies of monotone Puiseux monoids and fully classify their atomic structure.
