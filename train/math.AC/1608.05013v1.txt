Cofiniteness of the generalized local cohomology modules Hai(M, N) of two R-modules M and N with respect to an ideal a is studied for some i,s with a specified property. Furthermore, Artinianness of Hbj 0(Hai(M, N)) is investigated by using the above result, in certain graded situations, where b 0 is an ideal of R 0 such that b 0 + a 0 is an m 0-primary ideal.
