Let S=K[x_1,...,x_n] or S=K[[x_1,...,x_n]] be either a polynomial or a formal power series ring in a finite number of variables over a field K of characteristic p > 0 with [K:K^p] < \infty. Let R be the hypersurface S/fS where f is a nonzero nonunit element of S. If e is a positive integer, F_*^e(R) denotes the R-algebra structure induced on R via the e-times iterated Frobenius map ( r\rightarrow r^{p^e} ). We show an existence of a matrix factorization of f whose cokernel is isomorphic to F_*^e(R) as R-module. The presentation of F_*^e(R) as the cokernel of a matrix factorization of f enables us to find a characterization from which we can decide when the ring S[[u,v]]/(f+uv) has Finite F-representation type (FFRT) where S=K[[x_1,...,x_n]]. This allows us to create a class of rings that have Finite F-representation type but it does not have finite CM type. For S=K[[x_1,...,x_n]], we use this presentation to show that the ring S[[y]]/(y^{p^d} +f) has finite F-representation type for any f in S. Furthermore, we proved that S/I has Finite F-representation type when I is a monomial ideal in either S=K[x_1,...,x_n] or S=K[[x_1,...,x_n]]. Finally, this presentation enables us to compute the F-signature of the rings S[[u,v]]/(f+uv) and S[[z]]/(f+z^2) where S=K[[x_1,...,x_n]] and f is a monomial in the ring S.
