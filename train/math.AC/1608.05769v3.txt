Let R be a standard graded Noetherian algebra over an infinite field K and M a finitely generated \mathbb{Z}-graded R-module. Then for any graded ideal I\subseteq R_+ of R, we show that there exist integers e_1\geq e_2 such that r(I^nM)=\rho_I(M)n+e_1 and D(I^nM)=\rho_I(M)n+e_2 for n\gg0. Here r(M) and D(M) denote the reduction number of M and the maximal degree of minimal generators of M respectively, and \rho_I(M) is an integer determined by both M and I. We introduce the notion of generalized regularity function \Gamma for a standard graded algebra over a Noetherian ring and prove that \Gamma(I^nM) is also a linear function in n for n\gg 0.
