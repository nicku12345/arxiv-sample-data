Let H be an atomic monoid. The set of distances \Delta (H) of H is the set of all d \in \mathbb{N} with the following property: there are irreducible elements u\_1, \ldots, u\_k, v\_1 \ldots, v\_{k+d} such that u\_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot u\_k=v\_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot v\_{k+d} but u\_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot u\_k cannot be written as a product of \ell irreducible elements for any \ell \in \mathbb{N} with k\lt \ell \lt k+d. It is well-known (and easy to show) that, if \Delta (H) is nonempty, then \min \Delta (H) = \gcd \Delta (H). In this paper we show conversely that for every finite nonempty set \Delta \subset \mathbb{N} with \min \Delta = \gcd \Delta there is a finitely generated Krull monoid H such that \Delta (H)=\Delta.
