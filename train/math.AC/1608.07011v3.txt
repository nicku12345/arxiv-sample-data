For finitely generated modules M and N over a Gorenstein local ring R, one has depth M + depth N= depth(M\otimes N) +depth R, i.e., the depth formula holds, if M and N are Tor-independent and Tate homology \hat{Tor}_{i}^{R}(M,N) vanishes for all i\in\mathbb{Z}. We establish the same conclusion under weaker hypotheses: if M and N are \mathcal{G}-relative Tor-independent, then the vanishing of \hat{Tor}_{i}^{R}(M,N) for all i\le 0 is enough for the depth formula to hold. We also analyze the depth of tensor products of modules and obtain a necessary condition for the depth formula in terms of \mathcal{G}-relative homology.
