Let I be either the ideal of maximal minors or the ideal of 2-minors of a row graded or column graded matrix of linear forms L. In two previous papers we showed that I is a Cartwright-Sturmfels ideal, that is, the multigraded generic initial ideal gin(I) of I is radical (and essentially independent of the term order chosen). In this paper we describe generators and prime decomposition of gin(I) in terms of data related to the linear dependences among the row or columns of the submatrices of L. In the case of 2-minors we also give a closed formula for its multigraded Hilbert series.
