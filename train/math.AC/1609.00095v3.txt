Let (R,m)\to (S,n) be a flat local extension of local rings. Lech conjectured in 1960 that there should be a general inequality e(R)\leq e(S) on the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities. This conjecture is known when the base ring R has dimension less than or equal to two, and remains open in higher dimensions. In this paper, we prove Lech's conjecture in dimension three when R has equal characteristic. In higher dimension, our method yields substantial partial estimate: e(R)\leq (d!/2^d)\cdot e(S) where d=\dim R\geq 4, in equal characteristic.
