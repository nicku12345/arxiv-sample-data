We give a complete classification of free and non-free multiplicities on the A_3 braid arrangement. Namely, we show that all free multiplicities on A_3 fall into two families that have been identified by Abe-Terao-Wakefield (2007) and Abe-Nuida-Numata (2009). The main tool is a new homological obstruction to freeness derived via a connection to multivariate spline theory.
