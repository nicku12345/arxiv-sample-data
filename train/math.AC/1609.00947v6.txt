In this paper, we use elementary and simple ideas which are based on the significant applications of the power set ring to rebuild and study the patch topology on the prime spectrum from a completely different and new point of view. Specially, the proof of a major result in the literature on the comparison of topologies greatly simplified and shortened. Then we develop more natural and simple methods to obtain the flat topology and its properties. In particular, it is shown that the minimal spectrum of a commutative ring is quasi-compact with respect to the flat topology. Then as an application of this result, all of the related results of Kaplansky, Anderson, Gilmer-Heinzer, Bahmanpour-Khojali-Naghipour and Naghipour on the finiteness of the minimal primes are deduced as special cases of this result. Dually, a similar result is also obtained for maximal ideals.
