Let G be a finite simple graph and I(G) denote the corresponding edge ideal. For all s \geq 1, we obtain upper bounds for reg(I(G)^s) for bipartite graphs. We then compare the properties of G and G', where G' is the graph associated with the polarization of the ideal (I(G)^{s+1} : e_1\cdots e_s), where e_1,\ldots e_s are edges of G. Using these results, we explicitly compute reg(I(G)^s) for several subclasses of bipartite graphs.
