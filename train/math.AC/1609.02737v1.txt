Let M be a commutative cancellative monoid. The set \Delta(M), which consists of all positive integers which are distances between consecutive factorization lengths of elements in M, is a widely studied object in the theory of nonunique factorizations. If M is a Krull monoid with cyclic class group of order n \ge 3, then it is well-known that \Delta(M) \subseteq \{1, \dots, n-2\}. Moreover, equality holds for this containment when each class contains a prime divisor from M. In this note, we consider the question of determining which subsets of \{1, \dots, n-2\} occur as the delta set of an individual element from M. We first prove for x \in M that if n - 2 \in \Delta(x), then \Delta(x) = \{n-2\} (i.e., not all subsets of \{1,\dots, n-2\} can be realized as delta sets of individual elements). We close by proving an Archimedean-type property for delta sets from Krull monoids with finite cyclic class group: for every natural number m, there exist a Krull monoid M with finite cyclic class group such that M has an element x with |\Delta(x)| \ge m.
