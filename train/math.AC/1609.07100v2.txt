Let p and q be anisotropic quadratic forms over a field F of characteristic \neq 2, let s be the unique non-negative integer such that 2^s < \mathrm{dim}(p) \leq 2^{s+1}, and let k denote the dimension of the anisotropic part of q after scalar extension to the function field F(p) of p. We conjecture that \mathrm{dim}(q) must lie within k of a multiple of 2^{s+1}. This can be viewed as a direct generalization of Hoffmann's separation theorem. Among other cases, we prove that the conjecture is true if k<2^{s-1}. When k=0, this shows that any anisotropic form representing an element of the kernel of the natural restriction homomorphism W(F)\rightarrow W(F(p)) has dimension divisible by 2^{s+1}.
