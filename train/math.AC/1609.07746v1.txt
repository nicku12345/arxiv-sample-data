Let (R, \mathfrak m) be an unmixed Noetherian local ring, Q a parameter ideal and K an \mathfrak m-primary ideal of R containing Q. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for R to be Cohen-Macaulay in terms of g_0(Q) and g_1(Q), the Hilbert coefficients of Q with respect to K. As a consequence, we obtain a result of Ghezzi et al. which settles the negativity conjecture of W. V. Vasconcelos [15] in unmixed local rings.
