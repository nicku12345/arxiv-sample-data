Let I be a homogeneous ideal of \Bbbk[x_0,\ldots,x_n]. To compare I^{(m)}, the m-th symbolic power of I, with I^m, the regular m-th power, we introduce the m-th symbolic defect of I, denoted \operatorname{sdefect}(I,m). Precisely, \operatorname{sdefect}(I,m) is the minimal number of generators of the R-module I^{(m)}/I^m, or equivalently, the minimal number of generators one must add to I^m to make I^{(m)}. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the symbolic defect by considering the case that I is either the defining ideal of a star configuration or the ideal associated to a finite set of points in \mathbb{P}^2. We are specifically interested in identifying ideals I with \operatorname{sdefect}(I,2) = 1.
