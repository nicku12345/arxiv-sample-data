We generalize the concept of localization of a star operation to flat overrings; subsequently, we investigate the possibility of representing the set \mathrm{Star}(R) of star operations on R as the product of \mathrm{Star}(T), as T ranges in a family of overrings of R with special properties. We then apply this method to study the set of star operations on a Pr\"ufer domain R, in particular the set of stable star operations and the star-class groups of R.
