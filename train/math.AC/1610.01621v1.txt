Let F:\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \to \mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n] be a \mathbb{C}-algebra endomorphism that has an invertible Jacobian. We bring two ideas concerning the Jacobian Conjecture: First, we conjecture that for all n, the degree of the field extension \mathbb{C}(F(x_1),\ldots,F(x_n)) \subseteq \mathbb{C}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) is less than or equal to d^{n-1}, where d is the minimum of the degrees of the F(x_i)'s. If this conjecture is true, then the generalized Jacobian Conjecture is true. Second, we suggest to replace in some known theorems the assumption on the degrees of the F(x_i)'s by a similar assumption on the degrees of the minimal polynomials of the x_i's over \mathbb{C}(F(x_1)\ldots,f(x_n)); this way we obtain some analogous results to the known ones.
