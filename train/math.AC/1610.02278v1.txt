Given a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring over a field, we define the LCM-dual of the given ideal. We show good properties of LCM-duals. Including the isomorphism between the special fiber of LCM-dual and the special fiber of given monomial ideal. We show the special fibers of LCM-duals of strongly stable ideals are normal Cohen-Macaulay Koszul domains. We provide an explicit describing of minimal free resolutions of LCM-duals of strongly stable ideals.
