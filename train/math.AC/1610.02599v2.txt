It is proved that for a ring R that is either an affine algebra over a field, or an equicharacteristic complete local ring, some power of the Jacobian ideal of R annihilates \mathrm{Ext}^{d+1}_{R}(-,-), where d is the Krull dimension of R. Sufficient conditions are identified under which the Jacobian ideal itself annihilates these Ext-modules, and examples are provided that show that this is not always the case. A crucial new idea is to consider a derived version of the Noether different of an algebra.
