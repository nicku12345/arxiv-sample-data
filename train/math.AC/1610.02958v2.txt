By generalizing the notion of the path ideal of a graph, we study some algebraic properties of some path ideals associated to a line graph. We show that the quotient ring of these ideals are always sequentially Cohen-Macaulay and also provide some exact formulas for the projective dimension and the regularity of these ideals. As some consequences, we give some exact formulas for the depth of these ideals.
