Let d \geq 2 and m\geq 1 be integers such that \gcd (d,m)=1. Let {\mathfrak p} be the defining ideal of the monomial curve in {\mathbb A}_{ \Bbbk{k}}^d parametrized by (t^{n_1}, \ldots, t^{n_d}) where n_i = d + (i-1)m for all i = 1, \ldots, d. In this paper, we describe the symbolic powers {\mathfrak p}^{(n)}  for all n \geq 1. As a consequence we show that the symbolic blowup algebras {\mathcal R}_s{({\mathfrak p})} and G_{s}({\mathfrak p})  are Cohen-Macaulay. This gives a positive answer to a question posed by S.~Goto in \cite{goto}. We also discuss when these blowup algebras are Gorenstein. Moreover, for d=3, considering {\mathfrak p} as a weighted homogeneous ideal, we compute the resurgence, the Waldschmidt constant and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of {\mathfrak p}^{(n)} for all n \geq 1. The techniques of this paper for computing {\mathfrak p}^{(n)} are new and we hope that these will be useful to study the symbolic powers of other prime ideals.
