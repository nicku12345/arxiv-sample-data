A celebrated conjecture of Auslander and Reiten claims that a finitely generated module M that has no extensions with M\oplus \Lambda over an Artin algebra \Lambda must be projective. This conjecture is widely open in general, even for modules over commutative Noetherian local rings. Over such rings, we prove that a large class of ideals satisfy the extension condition proposed in the aforementioned conjecture of Auslander and Reiten. Along the way we obtain a new characterization of regularity in terms of the injective dimensions of certain ideals.
