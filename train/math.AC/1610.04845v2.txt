Let R=\bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Gamma}R_{\alpha} be a graded integral domain and \star be a semistar operation on R. For a\in R, denote by C(a) the ideal of R generated by homogeneous components of a and forf=f_0+f_1X+\cdots+f_nX^n\in R[X], let \A_f:=\sum_{i=0}^nC(f_i). Let N(\star):=\{f\in R[X]\mid f\neq0\text{and}\A_f^{\star}=R^{\star}\}. In this paper we study relationships between ideal theoretic properties of \NA(R,\star):=R[X]_{N(\star)} and the homogeneous ideal theoretic properties of R. For example we show that R is a graded Pr\"ufer-\star-multiplication domain if and only if \NA(D,\star) is a Pr\"ufer domain if and only if \NA(R,\star) is a B\'ezout domain. We also determine when \NA(R,v) is a PID.
