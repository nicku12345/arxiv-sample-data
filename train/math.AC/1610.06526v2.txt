Let I \subset k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n] be a squarefree monomial ideal a polynomial ring. In this paper we study multiplications on the minimal free resolution \mathbb{F} of k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]/I. In particular, we characterize the possible vectors of total Betti numbers for such ideals which admit a differential graded algebra (DGA) structure on \mathbb{F}. We also show that under these assumptions the maximal shifts of the graded Betti numbers are subadditive.   On the other hand, we present an example of a strongly generic monomial ideal which does not admit a DGA structure on its minimal free resolution. In particular, this demonstrates that the Hull resolution and the Lyubeznik resolution do not admit DGA structures in general.   Finally, we show that it is enough to modify the last map of \mathbb{F} to ensure that it admits the structure of a DG algebra.
