In this paper, we prove a finite basis theorem for radical well-mixed difference ideals generated by binomials. As a consequence, every strictly ascending chain of radical well-mixed difference ideals generated by binomials in a difference polynomial ring is finite, which answers a question raised by E. Hrushovski in the binomial case.
