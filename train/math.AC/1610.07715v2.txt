Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. We introduce the notion of colocalization functors with supports in arbitrary subsets of Spec R, which is a natural generalization of right derived functors of section functors with supports in specialization-closed subsets. We prove that the local duality theorem and the vanishing theorem of Grothendieck type hold for colocalization functors.
