Let V be a valuation domain of rank one and quotient field K. Let \overline{\hat{K}} be a fixed algebraic closure of the v-adic completion \hat K of K and let \overline{\hat{V}} be the integral closure of \hat V in \overline{\hat{K}}. We describe a relevant class of valuation domains W of the field of rational functions K(X) which lie over V, which are indexed by the elements \alpha\in\overline{\hat{K}}\cup\{\infty\}, namely, W=W_{\alpha}=\{\varphi\in K(X) \mid \varphi(\alpha)\in\overline{\hat{V}}\}. If V is discrete and \pi\in V is a uniformizer, then a valuation domain W of K(X) is of this form if and only if the residue field degree [W/M:V/P] is finite and \pi W=M^e, for some e\geq 1, where M is the maximal ideal of W. In general, for \alpha,\beta\in\overline{\hat{K}} we have W_{\alpha}=W_{\beta} if and only if \alpha and \beta are conjugated over \hat K. Finally, we show that the set \mathcal{P}^{{\rm irr}} of irreducible polynomials over \hat K endowed with an ultrametric distance introduced by Krasner is homeomorphic to the space \{W_{\alpha} \mid \alpha\in\overline{\hat{K}}\} endowed with the Zariski topology.
