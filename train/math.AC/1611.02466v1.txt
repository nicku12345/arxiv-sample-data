Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring of dimension d, M a commutative cancellative torsion-free monoid of rank r and P a finitely generated projective R[M]-module of rank t. (1) Assume M is \Phi-simplicial seminormal. (i) If M\in \CC(\Phi), then {\it Serre dim} R[M]\leq d. (ii) If r\leq 3, then {\it Serre dim} R[int(M)]\leq d. (2) If M\subset \BZ_+^2 is a normal monoid of rank 2, then {\it Serre dim} R[M]\leq d. (3) Assume M is c-divisible, d=1 and t\geq 3. Then P\cong \wedge^t P\op R[M]^{t-1}. (4) Assume R is a uni-branched affine algebra over an algebraically closed field and d=1. Then P\cong \wedge^t P\op R[M]^{t-1}.
