Let R be an affine algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 with dim(R)=n. Let P be a projective A=R[T_1,\cdots,T_k]-module of rank n with determinant L. Suppose I is an ideal of A of height n such that there are two surjections \alpha:P\to\!\!\!\to I and \phi:L\oplus A^{n-1} \to\!\!\!\to I. Assume that either (a) k=1 and n\geq 3 or (b) k is arbitrary but n\geq 4 is even. Then P has a unimodular element.
