Let  R  be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. We prove that the  n th syzygy module of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay  R -module cannot have a semidualizing direct summand for every  n \ge 1 . In particular, it follows that  R  is Gorenstein if and only if some syzygy of a canonical module of  R  has a non-zero free direct summand. We also give a number of necessary and sufficient conditions for a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of minimal multiplicity to be regular or Gorenstein. These criteria are based on vanishing of certain Exts or Tors involving syzygy modules of the residue field.
