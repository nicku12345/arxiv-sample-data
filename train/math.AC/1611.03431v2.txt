Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a Noetherian local ring of dimension d>0 and depth R\geq d-1. Let Q be a parameter ideal of R. In this paper, we derive uniform lower and upper bounds for the Hilbert coefficient e_i(Q) under certain assumptions on the depth of associated graded ring G(Q). For 2\leq i\leq d , we show that (1) e_i(Q)\leq 0 provided depth G(Q)\geq d-2 and (2) e_i(Q)\geq -\lambda_R(H_{\mathfrak{m}}^{d-1}(R)) provided depth G(Q)\geq d-1. It is proved that e_3(Q)\leq 0. Further, we obtain a necessary condition for the vanishing of the last coefficient e_d(Q). As a consequence, we characterize the vanishing of e_2(Q). Our results generalize \cite[Theorem 3.2]{goto-ozeki} and \cite[Corollary 4.5]{Lori}.
