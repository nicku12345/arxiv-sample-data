Let k be a field and R a standard graded k-algebra. We denote by \operatorname{H}^R the homology algebra of the Koszul complex on a minimal set of generators of the irrelevant ideal of R. We discuss the relationship between the multiplicative structure of \operatorname{H}^R and the property that R is a Koszul algebra. More generally, we work in the setting of local rings and we show that certain conditions on the multiplicative structure of Koszul homology imply strong homological properties, such as existence of certain Golod homomorphisms, leading to explicit computations of Poincar\'e series. As an application, we show that the Poincar\'e series of all finitely generated modules over a stretched Cohen-Macaulay local ring are rational, sharing a common denominator.
