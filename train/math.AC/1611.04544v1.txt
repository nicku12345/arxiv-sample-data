Schenck and Seceleanu proved that if R = k[x,y,z], where k is an infinite field, and I is an ideal generated by any collection of powers of linear forms, then multiplication by a general linear form L induces a homomorphism of maximal rank from any component of R/I to the next. That is, R/I has the {\em weak Lefschetz property}. Considering the more general {\em strong Lefschetz question} of when \times L^j has maximal rank for j \geq 2, we give the first systematic study of this problem. We assume that the linear forms are general and that the powers are all the same, i.e. that I is generated by {\em uniform} powers of general linear forms. We prove that for any number of such generators, \times L^2 always has maximal rank. We then specialize to almost complete intersections, i.e. to four generators, and we show that for j = 3,4,5 the behavior depends on the uniform exponent and on j, in a way that we make precise. In particular, there is always at most one degree where \times L^j fails maximal rank. Finally, we note that experimentally all higher powers of L fail maximal rank in at least two degrees.
