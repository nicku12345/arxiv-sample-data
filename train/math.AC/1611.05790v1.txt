Let (R, \mathfrak{m}, k) be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We study the suitable chains of semidualizing R-modules. We prove that when R is Artinian, the existence of a suitable chain of semidualizing modules of length n=\mathrm{max}\,\{\,i\geqslant 0\ |\ \mathfrak{m}^{i}\neq 0\,\} implies that the the Poincar\acute{\mathrm{e}} series of k and the Bass series of R have very specific forms. Also, in this case we show that the Bass numbers of R are strictly increasing. This gives an insight into the question of Huneke about the Bass numbers of R.
