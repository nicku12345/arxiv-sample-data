Let L be a degree 2 Galois extension of the field K and M an n\times n matrix with coefficients in L. Let \langle \ ,\ \rangle : L^n\times L^n\to L be the sesquilinear form associated to the involution \sigma: L\to L fixing K. This sesquilinear form defines the numerical range \mathrm{Num}(M) of any n\times n matrix over L. In this paper we study the convexity of \mathrm{Num}(M) (under certain assumptions on K and/or M). Many of the results are for ordered fields.
