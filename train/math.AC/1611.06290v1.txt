Let X and Y be schemes of finite type over \mathrm{Spec}\ \mathbb{Z} and let \alpha: Y \to X be a finite map. We show the following holds for all sufficiently large primes p: If \phi and \psi are any splittings on X \times \mathrm{Spec}\ F_p and Y \times \mathrm{Spec}\ F_p, such that the restriction of \alpha is compatible with \phi and \psi, and V is any compatibly split subvariety of (X \times \mathrm{Spec}\ F_p, \phi), then the reduction \alpha^{-1}(V)^{\mathrm{red}} is a compatibly split subvariety of (Y \times \mathrm{Spec}\ F_p, \psi). This is meant as a tool to aid in listing the compatibly split subvarieties of various classically split varieties.
