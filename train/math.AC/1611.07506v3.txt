In this paper, we study how the degrees of the elements in a minimal \mu-basis of a parametrized surface behave. For an arbitrary rational surface parametrization P(s,t)=(a_1(s,t),a_2(s,t),a_3(s,t),a_4(s,t)) \in \mathbb{F}[s,t]^4 over an infinite field \mathbb{F}, we show the existence of a \mu-basis with polynomials bounded in degree by O(d^{33}), where d=\max(\text{deg}(a_1),\text{deg}(a_2), \text{deg}(a_3), \text{deg}(a_4)). Under additional assumptions we can obtain tighter bounds.
