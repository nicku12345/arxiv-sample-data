Let q be a prime power. For u=(u_1,\dots ,u_n), v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n)\in \mathbb {F}_{q^2}^n let \langle u,v\rangle := \sum _{i=1}^{n} u_i^qv_i be the Hermitian form of \mathbb {F} _{q^2}^n. Fix an n\times n matrix M over \mathbb {F} _{q^2}. We study the case k=0 of the set \mathrm{Num} _k(M):= \{\langle u,Mu\rangle \mid u\in \mathbb {F} _{q^2}, \langle u,u\rangle =k\}. When M has coefficients in \mathbb {F} _q we study the set \mathrm{Num} _0(M)_q:= \{\langle u,Mu\rangle \mid u\in \mathbb {F} _q^n\}\subseteq \mathbb {F} _q. The set \mathrm{Num} _1(M) is the numerical range of M, previously introduced in a paper by Coons, Jenkins, Knowles, Luke and Rault (case q a prime p\equiv 3\pmod{4}) and by myself (arbitrary q). We study in details \mathrm{Num} _0(M) and \mathrm{Num} _0(M)_q when n=2. If q is even, \mathrm{Num} _0(M)_q is easily described for arbitrary n.
