Let (R, \mathfrak{m}) be a Noetherian local ring. In this paper, we introduce a dual notion for dualizing modules, namely codualizing modules. We study the basic properties of codualizing modules and use them to establish an equivalence between the category of noetherian modules of finite projective dimension and the category of artinian modules of finite projective dimension. Next, we give some applications of codualizing modules. Finally, we present a mixed identity involving quasidualizing module that characterize the codualizing module. As an application, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for R to be Gorenstein.
