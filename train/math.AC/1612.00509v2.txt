It is proved that a module M over a Noetherian ring R of positive characteristic p has finite flat dimension if there exists an integer t\ge 0 such that \operatorname{Tor}_i^R(M, {}^{f^{e}}\!R)=0 for t\le i\le t+\dim R and infinitely many e. This extends a result of Herzog, who proved it when M is finitely generated, and strengthens a result of the third author and Webb in the case M is arbitrary. It is also proved that when R is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, it suffices that the Tor vanishing holds for one e\ge \log_{p}e(R), where e(R) is the multiplicity of R.
