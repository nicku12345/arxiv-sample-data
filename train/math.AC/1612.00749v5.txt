Let A be a commutative noetherian ring, containing a field k, with 1/2\in k, \dim A=d, and let P be a projective A-module or rank(P)=n. In continuation of \cite{MM}, we study Homotopy obstructions for P to split off a free direct summand. Let {\mathcal LO}(P) be the set of all pairs (I, \omega), where I is an ideal of A and \omega: P\rightarrow I/I^2 is a surjective map. The homotopy relations on {\mathcal LO}(P), induced by {\mathcal LO}(P[T]), leads to a set \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right) of equivalence classes in {\mathcal LO}(P). There are two distinguished elements {\bf e}_0, {\bf e}_1\in \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right), respectively, the images of (0, 0) and (A, 0). Define the obstruction class e(P)={\bf e}_0\in \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right). The following results are under suitable smoothness or regularity hypotheses. When   2n\geq d+3, we prove e(P)={\bf e}_1 \Leftrightarrow P\cong Q\oplus A. We prove, if 2n\geq d+2, then   \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right) has a natural structure of a monoid, which is a group if P\cong Q\oplus A.   Further, we give a definition of a Euler class group E(P). Under suitable smoothness hypotheses, we prove, if P\cong Q\oplus A and 2n\geq d+3, then there is natural isomorphism E(P) \rightarrow \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right) of groups.
