This work concerns commutative algebras of the form R=Q/I, where Q is a standard graded polynomial ring and I is a homogenous ideal in Q. It has been proposed that when R is Koszul the ith Betti number of R over Q is at most \binom gi, where g is the number of generators of I; in particular, the projective dimension of R over Q is at most g. The main result of this work settles this question, in the affirmative, when g\le 3.
