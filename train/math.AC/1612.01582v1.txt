For each natural number n, we define a category whose objects are discriminant algebras in rank n, i.e. functorial means of attaching to each rank-n algebra a quadratic algebra with the same discriminant. We show that the discriminant algebras defined in [2], [6], and [10] are all isomorphic in this category, and prove furthermore that in ranks n \leq 3 discriminant algebras are unique up to unique isomorphism.
