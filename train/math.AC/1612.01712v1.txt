Let f(x) = \sum\limits _{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i  be a polynomial with coefficients from the ring \mathbb{Z} of integers satisfying either (i) 0 < a_0 \leq a_{1} \leq \cdots \leq a_{k-1} < a_{k} < a_{k+1} \leq \cdots \leq a_n for some k, 0 \leq k \leq n-1; or (ii) |a_n| > |a_{n-1}| + \cdots + |a_{0}| with a_0 \neq 0. In this paper, it is proved that if |a_n| or |f(m)| is a prime number for some integer m with |m|\geq 2  then the polynomial f(x) is irreducible over \mathbb{Z}.
