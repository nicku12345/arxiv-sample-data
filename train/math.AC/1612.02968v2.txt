Let K be a field of characteristic zero and let R=K[X_1, \ldots,X_n ], with standard grading. Let \mathfrak{m}= (X_1, \ldots, X_n) and let E be the ^*injective hull of R/\mathfrak{m}. Let A_n(K) be the n^{th} Weyl algebra over K. Let I, J be homogeneous ideals in R. Fix i,j \geq 0 and set M = H^i_I(R) and N = H^j_J(R) considered as left A_n(K)-modules.   We show the following two results for which no analogous result is known in charactersitc p > 0. \begin{enumerate}   H^l_\mathfrak{m}(\Tor^R_\nu(M, N)) \cong E(n)^{a_{l,\nu}} for some a_{l,\nu} \geq 0.   For all \nu \geq 0; the finite dimensional vector space \Tor^{A_n(K)}_\nu( M^\sharp, N) is concentrated in degree -n (here M^\sharp is the standard right A_n(K)-module associated to M). \end{enumerate} We also conjecture that for all i \geq 0 the finite dimensional vector space \Ext^i_{A_n(K)}(M, N) is concentrated in degree zero. We give a few examples which support this conjecture.
