Let A and B be commutative rings with unity, f:A\to B a ring homomorphism and J an ideal of B. Then the subring A\bowtie^fJ:=\{(a,f(a)+j)|a\in A and j\in J\} of A\times B is called the amalgamation of A with B along J with respect to f. In this paper, we study the property of Cohen-Macaulay in the sense of ideals which was introduced by Asgharzadeh and Tousi, a general notion of the usual Cohen-Macaulay property (in the Noetherian case), on the ring A\bowtie^fJ. Among other things, we obtain a generalization of the well-known result that when the Nagata's idealization is Cohen-Macaulay.
