We compute the depth and Stanley depth for the quotient ring of the path ideal of length 3 associated to a n-cyclic graph, given some precise formulas for depth when n\not\equiv 1\,(\mbox{mod}\ 4), tight bounds when n\equiv 1\,(\mbox{mod}\ 4) and for Stanley depth when n\equiv 0,3\,(\mbox{mod}\ 4), tight bounds when n\equiv 1,2\,(\mbox{mod}\ 4). Also, we give some formulas for depth and Stanley depth of a quotient of the path ideals of length n-1 and n.
