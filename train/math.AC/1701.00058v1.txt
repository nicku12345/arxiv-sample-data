A dense Puiseux monoid is an additive submonoid of \mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0} whose topological closure is \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}. It follows immediately that every Puiseux monoid failing to be dense is atomic. However, the atomic structure of dense Puiseux monoids is significantly complex. Dense Puiseux monoids can be antimatter, atomic, or anything in between, meaning non-atomic with finitely or countably many atoms. In the first part of this paper, we construct infinitely many non-isomorphic atomic Puiseux monoids whose sets of atoms are dense in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}. We dedicate the rest of the paper to study the atomic structure of three families of dense Puiseux monoids: k-primary, p-adic, and multiplicatively cyclic. In particular, we characterize an antimatter subfamily of k-primary Puiseux monoids and a hereditarily atomic subfamily of multiplicatively cyclic Puiseux monoids.
