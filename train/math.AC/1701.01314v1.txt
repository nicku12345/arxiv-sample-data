We classify plethories over fields of characteristic zero, thus answering a question of Borger-Wieland and Bergman-Hausknecht. All plethories over characteristic zero fields are linear, in the sense that they are free plethories on a bialgebra. For the proof we need some facts from the theory of ring schemes where we extend previously known results. We also classify plethories with trivial Verschiebung over a perfect field of non-zero characteristic and indicate future work.
