In this paper we study the O-sequences of the local (or graded) K-algebras of socle degree 4. More precisely, we prove that an O-sequence h=(1, 3, h_2, h_3, h_4), where h_4 \geq 2, is the h-vector of a local level K-algebra if and only if h_3\leq 3 h_4. We also prove that h=(1, 3, h_2, h_3, 1) is the h-vector of a local Gorenstein K-algebra if and only if h_3 \leq 3 and h_2 \leq \binom{h_3+1}{2}+(3-h_3). In each of these cases we give an effective method to construct a local level K-algebra with a given h-vector. Moreover we refine a result by Elias and Rossi by showing that if h=(1,h_1, h_2, h_3, 1) is an unimodal Gorenstein O-sequence, then h forces the corresponding Gorenstein K-algebra to be canonically graded if and only if h_1=h_3  and h_2=\binom{h_1+1}{2},  that is the h-vector is maximal.
