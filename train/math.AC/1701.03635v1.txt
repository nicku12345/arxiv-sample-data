In this paper we investigate to what extent the results of Z. Wang and D. Daigle on nice derivations of the polynomial ring in three variables over a field k of characteristic zero extend to the polynomial ring over a PID R, containing the field of rational numbers. One of our results shows that the kernel of a nice derivation on the polynomial ring in four variables over k of rank at most three is a polynomial ring over k.
