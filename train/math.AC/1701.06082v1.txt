By a localization property we mean a property that preserved under localizing modules at multiplicative closed sets. The aim of this paper is to find conditions under which we can transfere a certain property of a given module to its localization at multiplicative closed sets and conversely, that means we determine those conditions which make a given property of a module as a localization property, so we give several conditions under which certain types of modules posses localization property.
