Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a commutative complete equicharacteristic Gorenstein isolated singularity of dimension d  with k = A/\mathfrak{m} algebraically closed. Let \Gamma(A) be the AR (Auslander-Reiten) quiver of A. Let \mathcal{P} be a property of maximal Cohen-Macaulay A-modules. We show that some naturally defined properties \mathcal{P} define a union of connected components of \Gamma(A). So in this case if there is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay module satisfying \mathcal{P} and if A is not of finite representation type then there exists a family \{ M_n \}_{n \geq 1} of maximal Cohen-Macaulay indecomposable modules satisfying \mathcal{P} with multiplicity e(M_n) > n. Let \underline{\Gamma(A)} be the stable quiver. We show that there are many symmetries in \underline{\Gamma(A)}. As an application we show that if (A,\mathfrak{m}) is a two dimensional Gorenstein isolated singularity with multiplicity e(A) \geq 3 then for all n \geq 1 there exists an indecomposable self-dual maximal Cohen-Macaulay A-module of rank n.
