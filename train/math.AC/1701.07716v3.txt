Let \mathfrak{a} be an ideal of a commutative noetherian (not necessarily local) ring R. In the case \cd(\mathfrak{a},R)\leq 1, we show that the subcategory of \mathfrak{a}-cofinite R-modules is abelian. Using this and the technique of way-out functors, we show that if \cd(\mathfrak{a},R)\leq 1, or \dim(R/\mathfrak{a}) \leq 1, or \dim(R) \leq 2, then the local cohomology module H^{i}_{\mathfrak{a}}(X) is \mathfrak{a}-cofinite for every R-complex X with finitely generated homology modules and every i \in \mathbb{Z}. We further answer Question 1.3 in the three aforementioned cases, and reveal a correlation between Questions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.
