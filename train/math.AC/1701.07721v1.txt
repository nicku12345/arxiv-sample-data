Let \frak a be an ideal of a commutative noetherian ring R with unity and M an R-module supported at \V(\fa). Let n be the supermum of the integers i for which H^{\fa}_i(M)\neq 0. We show that M is \fa-cofinite if and only if the R-module \Tor^R_i(R/\fa,M) is finitely generated for every 0\leq i\leq n. This provides a hands-on and computable finitely-many-steps criterion to examine \mathfrak{a}-confiniteness. Our approach relies heavily on the theory of local homology which demonstrates the effectiveness and indispensability of this tool.
