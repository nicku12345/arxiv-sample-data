In this paper, the projectivity of a finitely generated flat module of a commutative ring is studied through its exterior powers and invariant factors and then various new results are obtained. Specially, the related results of Endo, Vasconcelos, Wiegand, Cox-Rush and Puninski-Rothmaler on the projectivity of finitely generated flat modules are generalized.
