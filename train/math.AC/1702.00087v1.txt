This is essentially an erratum, with some example to indicate inconsistencies. Suppose A=k[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n] is a polynomial ring over a field k. The Complete Intersection conjecture states that, for any ideal I in A, \mu(I)=\mu(I/I^2), where \mu denotes the minimal number of generators. When k is an infinite field, with 1/2\in k, a proof of this conjecture was claimed recently, which was a consequence of a stronger claim. A counter example of this stronger claim surfaced recently. This note discusses such examples and attempts to provide some clarity to the inconsistencies in the literature.
