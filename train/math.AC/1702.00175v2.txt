Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, \mathfrak a and \mathfrak b ideals of R. In this paper, we study the finiteness dimension f_{\mathfrak a}(M) of M relative to \mathfrak a and the \mathfrak b-minimum \mathfrak a-adjusted depth \lambda_{\mathfrak a}^{\mathfrak b}(M) of M, where the underlying module M is relative Cohen-Macaulay w.r.t \mathfrak a. Some applications of such modules are given.
