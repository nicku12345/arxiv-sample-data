In Section 1 of the paper, we prove McCoy's property for the zero-divisors of polynomials in semirings. We also investigate zero-divisors of semimodules and prove that under suitable conditions, the monoid semimodule M[G] has very few zero-divisors if and only if the S-semimodule M does so. The concept of Auslander semimodules are introduced in this section as well. In Section 2, we introduce Ohm-Rush and McCoy semialgebras and prove some interesting results for prime ideals of monoid semirings. In Section 3, we investigate the set of zero-divisors of McCoy semialgebras. We also introduce strong Krull primes for semirings and investigate their extension in semialgebras.
