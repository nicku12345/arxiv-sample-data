In this article, we propose a question on the annihilators of positive Koszul homologies of a system of parameters of an almost complete intersection R. The question can be stated in terms of the acyclicity of certain (finite) residual approximation complexes whose 0-th homologies are the residue field of R. We show that our question has an affirmative answer for the first Koszul homology of any almost complete intersection, as well as for all positive Koszul homologies of certain system of parameters which exist in some almost complete intersection rings with small multiplicities. The statement about the first Koszul homology is shown to be equivalent to the Monomial Conjecture and thus follows from its validity.
