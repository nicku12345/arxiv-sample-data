In this note, we continue to be interested in the relationship that connects the restricted distribution of finitude at the local level of intermediate fields of a purely inseparable extension K/k to the absolute or global finitude of K/k. In "{\it w\_0-generated field extensions,}Arch. Math. {\bf 47}, (1986), 410-412", JK Deveney constructed an example of modular extension K/k called w\_0 -generated such that for any proper subfield L of K/k , L is finite over k, and for every  n \in {\mathbf N}, we have  [k^{p^{- n}} \cap K: k] = p^{2n} . This example has proved to be extremely useful in the construction of other examples of w\_0-generated extensions. In particular, we prolong the w\_0-generated to an extension of unspecified finite size.However, when K/k is of unbounded size, we show that any modular extension of unbounded exponent admits a proper subextension of unbounded exponent. This brings us to study the w\_0-generated in the restricted sense. In addition, with the aim of extending the w\_0-generated to a purely inseparable extension of unbounded size, we propose other generalizations.
