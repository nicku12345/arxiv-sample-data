We show that the cosupport of a commutative noetherian ring is precisely the set of primes appearing in a minimal pure-injective resolution of the ring. As an application of this, we prove that every countable commutative noetherian ring has full cosupport. We also settle the comparison of cosupport and support of finitely generated modules over any commutative noetherian ring of finite Krull dimension. Finally, we give an example showing that the cosupport of a finitely generated module need not be a closed subset of \operatorname{Spec}(R), providing a negative answer to a question of Sather-Wagstaff and Wicklein.
