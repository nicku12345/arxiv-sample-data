Let \mathfrak{q} denote an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal of a d-dimensional local ring (A, \mathfrak{m}). Let \underline{a} = a_1,\ldots,a_d \subset \mathfrak{q} be a system of parameters. Then there is the following inequality for the multiplicities c \cdot e(\mathfrak{q};A) \leq e(\underline{a};A) where c denotes the product of the initial degrees of a_i in the form ring G_A(\mathfrak{q}). The aim of the paper is a characterization of the equality as well as a description of the difference by various homological methods via Koszul homology. To this end we have to characterize when the sequence of initial elements \underline{a^{\star}} = a_1^{\star}, \ldots,a_d^{\star} is a homogeneous system of parameters of G_A(\mathfrak{q}). In the case of \dim A = 2 this leads to results on the local Bezout inequality. In particular, we give several equations for improving the classical Bezout inequality to an equality.
