Given a radical ideal I in a regular ring R, the Containment Problem of symbolic and ordinary powers of I consists of determining when the containment I^{(a)} \subseteq I^b holds. By work of Ein-Lazersfeld-Smith, Hochster-Huneke and Ma-Schwede, there is a uniform answer to this question, but the resulting containments are not necessarily best possible. We show that a conjecture of Harbourne holds when R/I is F-pure, and prove tighter containments in the case when R/I is strongly F-regular.
