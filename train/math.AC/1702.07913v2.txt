Let (R,m) be a Noetherian local ring of dimension d and K,Q be m-primary ideals in R. In this paper we study the finiteness properties of the sets \Lambda_i^K(R):=\{g_i^K(Q): Q is a parameter ideal of R\}, where g_i^K(Q) denotes the Hilbert coefficients of Q with respect to K, for 1 \leq i \leq d. We prove that \Lambda_i^K(R) is finite for all 1\leq i \leq d if and only if R is generalized Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we show that if R is unmixed then finiteness of the set \Lambda_1^K(R) suffices to conclude that R is generalized Cohen-Macaulay. We obtain partial results for R to be Buchsbaum in terms of |\Lambda_i^K(R)|=1. We also obtain a criterion for the set \Delta^K(R):=\{g_1^K(I): I is an m-primary ideal of R\} to be finite, generalizing preceding results.
