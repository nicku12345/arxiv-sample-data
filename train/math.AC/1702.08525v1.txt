Let R be a commutative ring and M be an R-module, and let I(R)^* be the set of all non-trivial ideals of R. The M-intersection graph of ideals of R, denoted by G_M(R), is a graph with the vertex set I(R)^*, and two distinct vertices I and J are adjacent if and only if IM\cap JM\neq 0. For every multiplication R-module M, the diameter and the girth of G_M(R) are determined. Among other results, we prove that if M is a faithful R-module and the clique number of G_M(R) is finite, then R is a semilocal ring. We denote the \mathbb{Z}_n-intersection graph of ideals of the ring \mathbb{Z}_m by G_n(\mathbb{Z}_m), where n,m\geq 2 are integers and \mathbb{Z}_n is a \mathbb{Z}_m-module. We determine the values of n and m for which G_n(\mathbb{Z}_m) is perfect. Furthermore, we derive a sufficient condition for G_n(\mathbb{Z}_m) to be weakly perfect.
