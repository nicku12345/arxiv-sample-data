This paper studies properties of certain hypersurfaces in prime characteristic: we give a sufficient and necessary conditions for some classes of such hypersurfaces to have Finite F-representation Type (FFRT) and we compute the F-signatures of these hypersurfaces. The main method used in this paper is based on finding explicit matrix factorizations.
