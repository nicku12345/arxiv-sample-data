Let (R, \frak m) denote a local Cohen-Macaulay ring and I a non-nilpotent ideal of R. The purpose of this article is to investigate Faltings' finiteness dimension f_I(R) and equidimensionalness of certain homomorphic image of R. As a consequence we deduce that f_I(R)={\rm max}\{1, {\rm ht}\ I\} and if {\frak m}\mathrm{Ass}_R(R/I) is cotained in Ass_R(R), then the ring R/ I+\cup_{n\geq 1}(0:_RI^n) is equidimensional of dimension \dim R-1. Moreover, we will obtain a lower bound for injective dimension of the local cohomology module H^{{\rm ht}\ I}_I(R), in the case (R, \frak m) is a complete equidimensional local ring.
