Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, and let N be a non-zero finitely generated R-module. The purpose of this paper is to show that N is locally unmixed if and only if, for any N-proper ideal I of R generated by \Ht_N I elements, the topology defined by (IN)^{(n)}, n \geq 0, is linearly equivalent to the I-adic topology.
