Let \frak a denote an ideal in a regular local (Noetherian) ring R and let N be a finitely generated R-module with support in V(\frak a). The purpose of this paper is to show that all homomorphic images of the R-modules \Ext^j_R(N, H^i_{\frak a}(R)) have only finitely many associated primes, for all i, j\geq 0, whenever \dim R \leq4 or \dim R/ \frak a \leq 3 and R contains a field. In addition, we show that if \dim R=5 and R contains a field, then the R-modules \Ext^j_R(N, H^i_{\frak a}(R)) have only finitely many associated primes, for all i, j\geq 0.
