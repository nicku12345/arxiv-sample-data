The purpose of the present paper is to continue the study of modules cofinite and weakly cofinite with respect to an ideal \frak a of a Noetherian ring R. It is shown that an R-module M is cofinite with respect to \frak a, if and only if, \Ext^i_R(R/\frak a,M) is finitely generated for all i\leq {\rm cd}(\frak a,M)+1, whenever \dim R/\frak a=1. In addition, we show that if M is finitely generated and H^i_{\frak a}(M) are weakly Laskerian for all i\leq t-1, then H^i_{\frak a}(M) are {\frak a}-cofinite for all i\leq t-1 and for any minimax submodule K of H^{t}_{\frak a}(M), the R-modules \Hom_R(R/{\frak a}, H^{t}_{\frak a}(M)/K) and \Ext^{1}_R(R/{\frak a}, H^{t}_{\frak a}(M)/K) are finitely generated, where t is a non-negative integer. Finally, we explore a criterion for weakly cofiniteness of modules with respect to an ideal of dimension one. Namely for such ideals it suffices that the two first \Ext-modules in the definition for weakly cofiniteness are weakly Laskerian. As an application of this result we deduce that the category of all {\frak a}-weakly cofinite modules over R forms a full Abelian subcategory of the category of modules.
