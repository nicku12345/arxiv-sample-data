Let K be a field and X, Y denote matrices such that, the entries of X are either indeterminates over K or 0 and the entries of Y are indeterminates over K which are different from those appearing in X. We consider ideals of the form I_{1}(XY), which is the ideal generated by the homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 given by the 1\times 1 minors of the matrix XY. We prove that d-sequences and regular sequences arise naturally as part of generators of I_{1}(XY) for some special cases. We use this information to calculate the equations defining the Rees algebra of I_{1}(XY).
