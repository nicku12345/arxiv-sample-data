Let M be an atomic monoid and let x be a non-unit element of M. The elasticity of x, denoted by \rho(x), is the ratio of its largest factorization length to its shortest factorization length, and it measures how far is x from having a unique factorization. The elasticity \rho(M) of M is the supremum of the elasticities of all non-unit elements of M. The monoid M has accepted elasticity if \rho(M) = \rho(m) for some m \in M. In this paper, we study the elasticity of Puiseux monoids (i.e., additive submonoids of \mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}). First, we characterize the Puiseux monoids M having finite elasticity and find a formula for \rho(M). Then we classify the Puiseux monoids having accepted elasticity in terms of their sets of atoms. When M is a primary Puiseux monoid, we describe the topology of the set of elasticities of M, including a characterization of when M is a bounded factorization monoid. Lastly, we give an example of a Puiseux monoid that is bifurcus (that is, every nonzero element has a factorization of length at most 2).
