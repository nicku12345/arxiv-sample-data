The Cholesky decomposition plays an important role in finding the inverse of the correlation matrices. As it is a fast and numerically stable for linear system solving, inversion, and factorization compared to singular valued decomposition (SVD), QR factorization and LU decomposition. As different methods exist to find the Cholesky decomposition of a given matrix. This paper presents the comparative study of a proposed RChol algorithm with the conventional methods. The RChol algorithm is an explicit way to estimate the modified Cholesky factors of a dynamic correlation matrix.
