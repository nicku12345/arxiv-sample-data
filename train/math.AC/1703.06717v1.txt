We analyze the space of differentiable functions on a quad-mesh \cM, which are composed of 4-split spline macro-patch elements on each quadrangular face. We describe explicit transition maps across shared edges, that satisfy conditions which ensure that the space of differentiable functions is ample on a quad-mesh of arbitrary topology. These transition maps define a finite dimensional vector space of G^{1} spline functions of bi-degree \le (k,k) on each quadrangular face of \cM. We determine the dimension of this space of G^{1} spline functions for k big enough and provide explicit constructions of basis functions attached respectively to vertices, edges and faces. This construction requires the analysis of the module of syzygies of univariate b-spline functions with b-spline function coefficients. New results on their generators and dimensions are provided. Examples of bases of G^{1} splines of small degree for simple topological surfaces are detailed and illustrated by parametric surface constructions.
