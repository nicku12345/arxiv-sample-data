We study commutative algebra arising from generalised Frobenius numbers. The k-th (generalised) Frobenius number of natural numbers (a_1,\dots,a_n) is the largest natural number that cannot be written as a non-negative integral combination of (a_1,\dots,a_n) in k distinct ways. Suppose that L is the lattice of integers points of (a_1,\dots,a_n)^{\perp}. Taking cue from the concept of lattice modules due to Bayer and Sturmfels, we define generalised lattice modules M_L^{(k)} whose Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity captures the k-th Frobenius number of (a_1,\dots,a_n). We study the sequence \{M_L^{(k)}\}_{k=1}^{\infty} of generalised lattice modules providing an explicit characterisation of their minimal generators. We show that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of generalized lattice modules. As a consequence of our commutative algebraic approach, we show that the sequence of generalised Frobenius numbers forms a generalised arithmetic progression. We also construct an algorithm to compute the k-th Frobenius number.
