Let (R,\frak m) be a commutative noetherian local ring. In this paper, we prove that if \frak m is decomposable, then for any finitely generated R-module M of infinite projective dimension \frak m is a direct summand of (a direct sum of) syzygies of M. Applying this result to the case where \frak m is quasi-decomposable, we obtain several classfications of subcategories, including a complete classification of the thick subcategories of the singularity category of R.
