The notion of 2-AGL ring in dimension one which is a natural generalization of almost Gorenstein local ring is posed in terms of the rank of Sally modules of canonical ideals. The basic theory is developed, investigating also the case where the rings considered are numerical semigroup rings over fields. Examples are explored.
