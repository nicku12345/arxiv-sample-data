The notion of 2-almost Gorenstein ring is a generalization of the notion of almost Gorenstein ring in terms of Sally modules of canonical ideals. In this paper, we deal with two different topics related to 2-almost Gorenstein rings. The purposes are to determine all the Ulrich ideals in 2-almost Gorenstein rings and to clarify the structure of minimal free resolutions of 2-almost Gorenstein rings.
