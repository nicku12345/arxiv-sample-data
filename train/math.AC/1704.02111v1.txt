Given a 0-dimensional scheme in a projective space \mathbb{P}^n over a field K, we study the K\"ahler differential algebra \Omega_{R/K} of its homogeneous coordinate ring R. Using explicit presentations of the modules \Omega^m_{R/K} of K\"ahler differential m-forms, we determine many values of their Hilbert functions explicitly and bound their Hilbert polynomials and regularity indices. Detailed results are obtained for subschemes of \mathbb{P}^1, fat point schemes, and subschemes of \mathbb{P}^2 supported on a conic.
