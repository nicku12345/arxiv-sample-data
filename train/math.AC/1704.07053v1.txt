Let K be a field, G a finite group. Let G act on the function field L = K(x_{\sigma} : \sigma \in G) by \tau \cdot x_{\sigma} = x_{\tau\sigma} for any \sigma, \tau \in G. Denote the fixed field of the action by K(G) = L^{G} = \left\{ \frac{f}{g} \in L : \sigma(\frac{f}{g}) = \frac{f}{g}, \forall \sigma \in G \right\}. Noether's problem asks whether K(G) is rational (purely transcendental) over K. It is known that if G = C_m \rtimes C_n is a semidirect product of cyclic groups C_m and C_n with \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n] a unique factorization domain, and K contains an eth primitive root of unity, where e is the exponent of G, then K(G) is rational over K. In this paper, we give another criteria to determine whether K(C_m \rtimes C_n) is rational over K. In particular, if p, q are prime numbers and there exists x \in \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_q] such that the norm N_{\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_q)/\mathbb{Q}}(x) = p, then \mathbb{C}(C_{p} \rtimes C_{q}) is rational over \mathbb{C}.
