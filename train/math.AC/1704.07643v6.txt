Let J\subset I be ideals in a formally equidimensional local ring with \lambda(I/J)<\infty. Rees proved that \lambda(I^n/J^n) is a polynomial P(I/J)(X) in n of degree at most dim R and J is a reduction of I if and only if deg P(I/J)(X)\leq dim R-1. We extend this result for all Noetherian filtrations of ideals in a formally equidimensional local ring and for (not necessarily Noetherian) filtrations of ideals in analytically irreducible rings. We provide certain classes of ideals such that deg P(I/J) achieves its maximal degree. On the other hand, for ideals J\subset I in a formally equidimensional local ring, we consider the multiplicity function e(I^n/J^n) which is a polynomial in n for all large n. We explicitly determine the deg e(I^n/J^n) in some special cases. For an ideal J of analytic deviation one, we give characterization of reductions in terms of deg e(I^n/J^n) under some additional conditions.
