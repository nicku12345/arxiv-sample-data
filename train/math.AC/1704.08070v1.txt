Two-dimensional cyclic codes of length n=\ell s over the finite field \mathbb{F} are ideals of the polynomial ring \frac{\mathbb{F}[x,y]}{< x^{s}-1,y^{\ell}-1 >}. The aim of this paper, is to present a novel method to study the algebraic structure of two-dimensional cyclic codes of any length n=\ell s over the finite field \mathbb{F}. By using this method, we find the generator polynomials for ideals of \frac{\mathbb{F}[x,y]}{< x^{s}-1,y^{\ell}-1 >} corresponding to two dimensional cyclic codes. These polynomials will be applied to obtain the generator matrix for two- dimensional cyclic codes.
