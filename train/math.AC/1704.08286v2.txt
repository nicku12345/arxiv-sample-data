Let \mathcal{L} be a finite distributive lattice and S=K[x_\alpha: \alpha \in \mathcal{L}] be a polynomial ring over a field K and I=\langle x_\alpha x_\beta - x_{\alpha\vee \beta} x_{\alpha\wedge\beta} : \alpha \nsim \beta,\alpha,\beta \in {\mathcal{L}} \rangle an ideal of S. In this article we describe the first syzygy of the Hibi ring R[\mathcal{L}]=S/I, for a planar distributive lattice \mathcal{L}. We also derive an exact formula for the first Betti number of a planar distributive lattice. We give a characterization of planar distributive lattices for which the first syzygy is linear.
