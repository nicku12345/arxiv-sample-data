In this paper, some algebraic and combinatorial characterizations of the spanning simplicial complex \Delta_s(\mathcal{J}_{n,m}) of the Jahangir's graph \mathcal{J}_{n,m} are explored. We show that \Delta_s(\mathcal{J}_{n,m}) is pure, present the formula for f-vectors associated to it and hence deduce a recipe for computing the Hilbert series of the Face ring k[\Delta_s(\mathcal{J}_{n,m})]. Finaly, we show that the face ring of \Delta_s(\mathcal{J}_{n,m}) is Cohen-Macaulay and give some open scopes of the current work.
