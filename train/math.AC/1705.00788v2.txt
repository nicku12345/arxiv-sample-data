We consider the (graded) Matlis dual \DD(M) of a graded \D-module M over the polynomial ring R = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] (k is a field of characteristic zero), and show that it can be given a structure of \D-module in such a way that, whenever \dim_kH^i_{dR}(M) is finite, then H^i_{dR}(M) is k-dual to H^{n-i}_{dR}(\DD(M)). As a consequence, we show that if M is a graded \D-module such that H^n_{dR}(M) is a finite-dimensional k-space, then \dim_k(H^n_{dR}(M)) is the maximal integer s for which there exists a surjective \D-linear homomorphism M \rightarrow E^s, where E is the top local cohomology module H^n_{(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}(R). This extends a recent result of Hartshorne and Polini on formal power series rings to the case of polynomial rings; we also apply the same circle of ideas to provide an alternate proof of their result. When M is a finitely generated graded \D-module such that \dim_kH^i_{dR}(M) is finite for some i, we generalize the above result further, showing that H^{i}_{dR}(M) is k-dual to \Ext_{\D}^{n-i}(M, \E).
