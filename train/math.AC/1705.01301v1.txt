Let V be a minimal valuation overring of an integral domain D and let \mathrm{Zar}(D) be the Zariski space of the valuation overrings of D. Starting from a result in the theory of semistar operations, we prove a criterion under which the set \mathrm{Zar}(D)\setminus\{V\} is not compact. We then use it to prove that, in many cases, \mathrm{Zar}(D) is not a Noetherian space, and apply it to the study of the spaces of Kronecker function rings and of Noetherian overrings.
