This work concerns the moment map \mu associated with the standard representation of a classical Lie algebra. For applications to deformation quantization it is desirable that S/(\mu), the coordinate algebra of the zero fibre of \mu, be Koszul. The main result is that this algebra is not Koszul for the standard representation of \mathfrak{sl}_{n}, and of \mathfrak{sp}_{n}. This is deduced from a computation of the Betti numbers of S/(\mu) as an S-module, which are of interest also from the point of view of commutative algebra.
