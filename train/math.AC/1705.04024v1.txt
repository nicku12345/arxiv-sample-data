Let \mathfrak{q} denote an ideal in a Noetherian local ring (A,\mathfrak{m}). Let \underline{a}=a_1,\ldots,a_d \subset \mathfrak{q} denote a system of parameters in a finitely generated A-module M. This note investigate an improvement of the inequality c_1\cdot \ldots \cdot c_d \cdot e_0(\mathfrak{q};M) \leq \ell_A(M/\underline{a}\,M), where c_i denote the initial degrees of a_i in the form ring G_A(\mathfrak{q}). To this end, there is an investigation of regular sequences in the form module G_M(\mathfrak{q}) by homology of a factor complex of the Koszul complex. In a particular case, there is a discussion of classical local B\'ezout inequality in the affine d-space \mathbb{A}^d_k.
