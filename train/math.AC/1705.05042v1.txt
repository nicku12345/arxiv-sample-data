Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with a canonical module. We consider Auslander's (higher) delta invariants of powers of certain ideals of R. Firstly, we shall provide some conditions for an ideal to be a parameter ideal in terms of delta invarints. As an application of this result, we give upper bounds for orders of Ulrich ideals of R when R has Gorenstein punctured spectrum. Secondly, we extend the definition of indices to the ideal case, and generalize the result of Avramov-Buchweitz-Iyengar-Miller on the relationship between the index and regularity.
