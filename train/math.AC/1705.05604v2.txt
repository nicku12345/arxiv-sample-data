In this work, the set of quasi-primary ideals of a commutative ring with identity is equipped with a topology and is called quasi-primary spectrum. Some topological properties of this space are examined. Further, a sheaf of rings on the quasi-primary spectrum is constructed and it is shown that this sheaf is the direct image sheaf with respect to the inclusion map from the prime spectrum of a ring to the quasi-primary spectrum of the same ring.
