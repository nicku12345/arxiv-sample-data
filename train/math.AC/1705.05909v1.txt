We extend to one dimensional quotients the result of A. Conca and S. Murai on the convexity of the regularity of Koszul cycles. By providing a relation between the regularity of Koszul cycles and Koszul homologies we prove a sharp regularity bound for the Koszul homologies of a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring under the same conditions.
