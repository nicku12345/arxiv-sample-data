In this paper, we state criteria of a Hibi ring to be level, non-Gorenstein and almost Gorenstein and to be non-level and almost Gorenstein in terms of the structure of the partially ordered set defining the Hibi ring. We also state a criterion of a ladder determinantal ring defined by 2-minors to be non-Gorenstein and almost Gorenstein in terms of the shape of the ladder.
