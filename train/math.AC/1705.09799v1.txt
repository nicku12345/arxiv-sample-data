We introduce the concept of multiplicatively closed subsets of a commutative ring R which split an R-module M and study factorization properties of elements of M with respect to such a set. Also we demonstrate how one can utilize this concept to investigate factorization properties of R and deduce some Nagata type theorems relating factorization properties of R to those of its localizations, when R is an integral domain.
