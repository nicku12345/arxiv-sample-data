In this paper, we study a family of binomial ideals defining monomial curves in the n-dimensional affine space determined by n hypersurfaces of the form x_i^{c_i} - x_1^{u_{i1}} \cdots x_n^{u_{1n}} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] with u_{ii} = 0, i\in \{ 1, \ldots, n\}. We prove that, the monomial curves in that family are set-theoretic complete intersection. Moreover, if the monomial curve is irreducible, we compute some invariants such as genus, type and Fr\"obenius number of the corresponding numerical semigroup. We also describe a method to produce set-theoretic complete intersection semigroup ideals of arbitrary large height.
