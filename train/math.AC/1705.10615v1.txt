The notion of linkage with respect to a semidualizing module is introduced. It is shown that over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with canonical module, every Cohen-Macaulay module of finite Gorenstein injective dimension is linked with respect to the canonical module. For a linked module M with respect to a semidualizing module, the connection between the Serre condition (S_n) on M with the vanishing of certain local cohomology modules of its linked module is discussed.
