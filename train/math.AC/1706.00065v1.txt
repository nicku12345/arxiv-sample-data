A pair of ideals J\subseteq I\subseteq R has been called Aluffi torsion-free if the Aluffi algebra of I/J is isomorphic with the corresponding Rees algebra. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the Aluffi torsion-free property in terms of the first syzygy module of the form ideal J^* in the associated graded ring of I. For two pairs of ideals J_1,J_2\subseteq I such that J_1-J_2\in I^2, we prove that if one pair is Aluffi torsion-free the other one is so if and only if the first syzygy modules of J_1 and J_2 have the same form ideals. We introduce the notion of strongly Aluffi torsion-free ideals and present some results on these ideals.
