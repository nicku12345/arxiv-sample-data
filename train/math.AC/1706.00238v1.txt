Let R be a commutative Noetherian Cohen-Macaulay local ring that has positive dimension and prime characteristic. Li proved that the tensor product of a finitely generated non-free R-module M with the Frobenius endomorphism {}^{\varphi^n}\!R is not maximal Cohen-Macaulay provided that M has rank and n\gg 0. We replace the rank hypothesis with the weaker assumption that M is locally free on the minimal prime ideals of R. As a consequence, we obtain, if R is a one-dimensional non-regular complete reduced local ring that has a perfect residue field and prime characteristic, then {}^{\varphi^n}\!R \otimes_{R}{}^{\varphi^n}\!R has torsion for all n\gg0. This property of the Frobenius endomorphism came as a surprise to us since, over such rings R, there exist non-free modules M such that M\otimes_{R}M is torsion-free.
