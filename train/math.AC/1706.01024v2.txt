Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a regular local ring or a polynomial ring over a field, and let I be an ideal of R which we assume to be graded if R is a polynomial ring. Let astab(I) resp. \overline{\rm astab}(I) be the smallest integer n for which Ass(I^n) resp. Ass(\overline{I^n}) stabilize, and dstab(I) be the smallest integer n for which depth(I^n) stabilizes. Here \overline{I^n} denotes the integral closure of I^n. We show that astab(I)=\overline{\rm astab}(I)={\rm dstab}(I) if dim\,R\leq 2, while already in dimension 3, astab(I) and \overline{\rm astab}(I) may differ by any amount. Moreover, we show that if dim\,R=4, then there exist ideals I and J such that for any positive integer c one has {\rm astab}(I)-{\rm dstab}(I)\geq c and {\rm dstab}(J)-{\rm astab}(J)\geq c.
