This expository article delves into the Greenlees-May Duality Theorem which is widely thought of as a far-reaching generalization of the Grothendieck's Local Duality Theorem. This theorem is not addressed in the literature as it merits and its proof is indeed a tangled web in a series of scattered papers. By carefully scrutinizing the requisite tools, we present a clear-cut well-documented proof of this theorem for the sake of bookkeeping.
