Let \mathcal{R}_e be a finite commutative chain ring with nilpotency index e \geq 2. In this paper, all repeated-root constacyclic codes of arbitrary lengths over \mathcal{R}_{2}, their sizes and their dual codes are determined. As an application, some isodual constacyclic codes over \mathcal{R}_{2} are also listed. Moreover, Hamming distances, Rosenbloom-Tsfasman distances and Rosenbloom-Tsfasman weight distributions of all repeated-root constacyclic codes over \mathcal{R}_{2} and some repeated-root constacyclic codes over \mathcal{R}_{e} are determined.
