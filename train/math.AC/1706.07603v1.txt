Let I be a monomial ideal I in a polynomial ring R = k[x_1,...,x_r]. In this paper we give an upper bound on \overline{\dstab} (I) in terms of r and the maximal generating degree d(I) of I such that \depth R/\overline{I^n} is constant for all n\geqslant \overline{\dstab}(I). As an application, we classify the class of monomial ideals I such that \overline{I^n} is Cohen-Macaulay for some integer n\gg 0.
