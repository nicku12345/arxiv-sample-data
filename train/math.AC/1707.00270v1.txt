Recently, in [DvZa], we have introduced EMV-algebras which resemble MV-algebras but the top element is not guaranteed for them. For \sigma-complete EMV-algebras, we prove an analogue of the Loomis--Sikorski Theorem showing that every \sigma-complete EMV-algebra is a \sigma-homomorphic image of an EMV-tribe of fuzzy sets where all algebraic operations are defined by points. To prove it, some topological properties of the state-morphism space and the space of maximal ideals are established.
