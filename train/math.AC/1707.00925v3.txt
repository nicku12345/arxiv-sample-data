This short paper presents saturation-based algorithms for homogenization and elimination. This algorithm can compute elimination ideals by using syzygies and ideal membership test, hence it works with any} monomial order, in particular without the use of block-elimination orders. The used saturation is a translation of the geometric fact that the projective closure of an affine scheme has no components in the hyperplane at infinity.
