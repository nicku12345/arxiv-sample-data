In this paper we consider the problem of computing all possible order ideals and also sets connected to 1, and the corresponding border bases, for the vanishing ideal of a given finite set of points. In this context two different approaches are discussed: based on the Buchberger-M\"oller Algorithm, we first propose a new algorithm to compute all possible order ideals and the corresponding border bases for an ideal of points. The second approach involves adapting the Farr-Gao Algorithm for finding all sets connected to 1, as well as the corresponding border bases, for an ideal of points. It should be noted that our algorithms are term ordering free. Therefore they can compute successfully all border bases for an ideal of points. Both proposed algorithms have been implemented and their efficiency is discussed via a set of benchmarks.
