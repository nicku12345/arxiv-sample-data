Aghapournahr and Melkersson introduced the notion of Melkersson condition on a Serre subcategory of the module category over a commutative noetherian ring. This paper investigates the structure of set of prime ideals satisfying a Melkersson condition on a Serre subcategory. We try to calculate members of a set of these prime ideals for a subcategory consisting of extension modules in two given Serre subcategories of the module category. Meanwhile, we classify the structure of set of prime ideals satisfying a Melkersson condition over a 0-dimensional ring, a 1-dimensional local ring, and a 2-dimensional local domain.
