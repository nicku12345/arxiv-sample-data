In this note we study the freeness of the module of derivations on all moduli of the X_3 arrangement with multiplicities. We use homological techniques stemming from work of Yuzvinsky, Brandt, and Terao which have recently been developed for multi-arrangements by the first author, Francisco, Mermin, and Schweig.
