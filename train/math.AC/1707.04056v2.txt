Following Roos, we say that a local ring R is good if all finitely generated R-modules have rational Poincar\'e series over R, sharing a common denominator. Rings with the Backelin-Roos property and generalised Golod rings are good due to results of Levin and Avramov respectively. Let R be an Artinian Gorenstein local ring. The ring R is shown to have the Backelin-Roos property if R/ soc(R) is a Golod ring. Furthermore the ring R is generalised Golod if and only if R/ soc(R) is so.   We explore when connected sums of Artinian Gorenstein local rings are good. We provide a uniform argument to show that stretched, almost stretched Gorenstein rings are good and show further that the Auslander-Reiten conjecture holds true for such rings. We prove that Gorenstein rings of multiplicity at most eleven are good. We recover a result of Rossi-\c{S}ega on the good property of compressed Gorenstein local rings in a stronger form by a shorter argument.
