The Casas-Alvero conjecture is formulated in an affine setting and linked with dimension=1 of the defined algebraic sets. Then by base change to over finite fields, we could interpret the conjecture in computational algebraic geometry. The key tool is Nullstellensatz over finite fields, which promises a counting method using standard monomials. Then we give a tentative proof of the conjecture in this setting.
