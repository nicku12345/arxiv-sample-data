Let \mathbb{F}_{q} denote the finite field of order q, let m_1,m_2,\cdots,m_{\ell} be positive integers satisfying \gcd(m_i,q)=1 for 1 \leq i \leq \ell, and let n=m_1+m_2+\cdots+m_{\ell}. Let \Lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\cdots,\lambda_{\ell}) be fixed, where \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\cdots,\lambda_{\ell} are non-zero elements of \mathbb{F}_{q}. In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of \Lambda-multi-twisted codes of length n over \mathbb{F}_{q} and their dual codes with respect to the standard inner product on \mathbb{F}_{q}^n. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a self-dual \Lambda-multi-twisted code of length n over \mathbb{F}_{q}, and obtain enumeration formulae for all self-dual and self-orthogonal \Lambda-multi-twisted codes of length n over \mathbb{F}_{q}. We also derive some sufficient conditions under which a \Lambda-multi-twisted code is LCD. We determine the parity-check polynomial of all \Lambda-multi-twisted codes of length n over \mathbb{F}_{q} and obtain a BCH type bound on their minimum Hamming distances. We also determine generating sets of dual codes of some \Lambda-multi-twisted codes of length n over \mathbb{F}_{q} from the generating sets of the codes. Besides this, we provide a trace description for all \Lambda-multi-twisted codes of length n over \mathbb{F}_{q} by viewing these codes as direct sums of certain concatenated codes, which leads to a method to construct these codes. We also obtain a lower bound on their minimum Hamming distances using their multilevel concatenated structure.
