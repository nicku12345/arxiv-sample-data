Let  K / k  be a purely inseparable extension of characteristic  p> 0  and of finite size. We recall that K/k is modular if for every n \in \mathbb{N},K^{p^n} and k are k\cap K^{p^ n}-linearly disjoint. A natural generalization of this notion is to say that K/k is lq-modular if K is modular over a finite extension of k. Our main objective is to extend in definite form the results and definitions of the lq-modularity that have already been obtained in the case limited by the finiteness condition imposed on [k :k^p] in a rather general framework (framework of extensions of finite size called also q-finite extensions).First, by means of invariants, we characterize the lq-modularity of a q-finite extension. Next, we show that any intersection of a q-finite extensions covering k or K preserves the lq-modularity. We also prove that any q-finite extension  K/k  contains a greater lq-modular and relatively perfect sub-extension. In particular, this result is very useful for defining the modularity of order i linked to a q-finite extension  K/k .Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for K/k to be i-modular. Certainly, the modularity level of  K / k  never exceeds the sizeof K/k. Notably, we explicitly describe the extension K/k  whose degree of modularity is the size of  K / k . In the end, we examine a particular decomposition of  K/k  defined by inverse chaining.
