Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, \Phi a system of ideals of R and I\in \Phi. Let M be an R-module (not necessary I-torsion) such that \dim M\leq 1, then the R-module \Ext^i_{R}(R/I, M) is weakly Laskerian, for all i\geq 0, if and only if the R-module \Ext^i_{R}(R/I, M) is weakly Laskerian, for i=0, 1. Let t\in\Bbb{N}_0 be an integer and M an R-module such that \Ext^i_R(R/I,M) is weakly Laskerian for all i\leq t+1. We prove that if the R-module \lc^{i}_\Phi(M) is {\rm FD_{\leq 1}} for all i<t, then \lc^{i}_\Phi(M) is \Phi-weakly cofinite for all i<t and for any {\rm FD_{\leq 0}} (or minimax) submodule N of \lc^t_\Phi(M), the R-modules \Hom_R(R/I,\lc^t_\Phi(M)/N) and \Ext^1_R(R/I,\lc^t_\Phi(M)/N) are weakly Laskerian. Let N be a finitely generated R-module. We also prove that \Ext^j_R(N,\lc^{i}_\Phi(M)) and {\rm Tor}^R_{j}(N,H^{i}_\Phi(M)) are \Phi-weakly cofinite for all i and j whenever M is weakly Laskerian and \lc^{i}_\Phi(M) is {\rm   FD_{\leq 1}} for all i. Similar results are true for ordinary local cohomology modules and local cohomology modules defined by a pair of ideals.
