We study the number of generators of ideals in regular rings and ask the question whether \mu(I)<\mu(I^2) if I is not a principal ideal, where \mu(J) denotes the number of generators of an ideal J. We provide lower bounds for the number of generators for the powers of an ideal and also show that the CM-type of I^2 is \geq 3 if I is a monomial ideal of height n in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] and n\geq 3.
