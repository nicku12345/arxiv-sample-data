We present a sufficient condition for irreducibility of forcing algebras and study the (non)-reducedness phenomenon. Furthermore, we prove a criterion for normality for forcing algebras over a polynomial base ring with coefficients in a perfect field. This gives a geometrical normality criterion for algebraic (forcing) varieties over algebraically closed fields. Besides, we examine in detail an specific (enlightening) example with several forcing equations. Finally, we compute explicitly the normalization of a particular forcing algebra by means of finding explicitly the generators of the ideal defining it as an affine ring.
