We develop a notion of (principal) differential rank for differential-valued fields, in analog of the exponential rank and of the difference rank. We give several characterizations of this rank. We then give a method to define a derivation on a field of generalized power series and use this method to show that any totally ordered set can be realized as the principal differential rank of a H-field.
