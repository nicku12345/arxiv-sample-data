We present a more general (parametric-) homological characterization of the Direct Summand Theorem. Specifically, we state two new conjectures: the Socle-Parameter conjecture (SPC) in its weak and strong forms. We give a proof for the week form by showing that it is equivalent to the Direct Summand Conjecture (DSC), now known to be true after the work of Y. Andr\'{e}, based on Scholze's theory of perfectoids. Furthermore, we prove the SPC in its strong form for the case when the multiplicity of the parameters is smaller or equal than two. Finally, we present a new proof of the DSC in the equicharacteristic case, based on the techniques thus developed.
