Let A be a commutative Noetherian ring containing a field K of characteristic zero and let R= A[X_1, \ldots, X_m]. Consider R as standard graded with \deg A=0 and \deg X_i=1 for all i. We present a few results about the behavior of the graded components of local cohomology modules H_I^i(R) where I is an arbitrary homogeneous ideal in R. We mostly restrict our attention to the Vanishing, Tameness and Rigidity problems.
