Macaulay's inverse system is an effective method to construct Artinian K-algebras with additional properties like, Gorenstein, level, more generally with any socle type. Recently, Elias and Rossi gave the structure of the inverse system of d-dimensional Gorenstein K-algebras for any d>0. In this paper we extend their result by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between d-dimensional level K-algebras and certain submodules of the divided power ring. We give several examples to illustrate our result.
