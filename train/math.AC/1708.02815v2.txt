We identify minimal cases in which a power m^i\not=0 of the maximal ideal of a local ring R is not Golod, i.e.\ the quotient ring R/m^i is not Golod. Complementary to a 2014 result by Rossi and \c{S}ega, we prove that for a generic artinian Gorenstein local ring with m^4=0\not= m^3, the quotient R/m^3 is not Golod. This is provided that m is minimally generated by at least 3 elements. Indeed, we show that if m is 2-generated, then every power m^i\not= 0 is Golod.
