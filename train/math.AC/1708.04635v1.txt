Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, N a finitely generated R-module and I an ideal of R. The set \bar{Q^*}(I, N), the quintasymptotic primes of I with respect to N, was originally introduced by McAdam \cite{Mc2}. Also, the ideal I_a^{(N)}, the integral closure of I with respect to N, was introduced by R.Y. Sharp et al. in \cite{STY}. The purpose of this paper is to show that, whenever S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R then the topologies defined by \{(I^n)_a^{(N)}\}_{n\geq1} and \{S((I^n)_a^{(N)})\}_{n\geq1} are equivalent if and only if S is disjoint from the quintasymptotic primes of I with respect to N. In addition, using this result, we also show that, if (R, \mathfrak{m}) is local and N is quasi-unmixed, then the local cohomology module H^{\dim N}_I(N) vanishes if and only if there exists a multiplicatively closed subset S of R such that \mathfrak{m} \cap S \neq \emptyset and the topologies induced by \{(I^n)_a^{(N)}\}_{n\geq1} and \{S((I^n)_a^{(N)})\}_{n\geq1} are equivalent. As a special of this characterization we obtain the main result of Marti-Farre \cite{MF}.
