Let k be a field and G \subseteq Gl_n(k) be a finite group with |G|^{-1} \in k. Let G act linearly on A = k[X_1, \ldots, X_n] and let A^G be the ring of invariant's. Suppose there does not exist any non-trivial one-dimensional representation of G over k. Then we show that if Q is a G-invariant homogeneous ideal of A such that A/Q is a Gorenstein ring then A^G/Q^G is also a Gorenstein ring.
