Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a local Noetherian ring with residue field k. While much is known about the generating sets of reductions of ideals of R if k is infinite, the case in which k is finite is less well understood. We investigate the existence (or lack thereof) of proper reductions of an ideal of R and the number of generators needed for a reduction in the case k is a finite field. When R is one-dimensional, we give a formula for the smallest integer n for which every ideal has an n-generated reduction. It follows that in a one-dimensional local Noetherian ring every ideal has a principal reduction if and only if the number of maximal ideals in the normalization of the reduced quotient of R is at most |k|. In higher dimensions, we show that for any positive integer, there exists an ideal of R that does not have an n-generated reduction and that if n \geq \dim R this ideal can be chosen to be \mathfrak{m}-primary. In the case where R is a two-dimensional regular local ring, we construct an example of an integrally closed \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal that does not have a 2-generated reduction and thus answer in the negative a question raised by Heinzer and Shannon.
