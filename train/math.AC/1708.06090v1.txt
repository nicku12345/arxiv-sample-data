In this paper, we introduce the notion of the strong Rees property (SRP) for \mathfrak{m}-primary ideals of a Noetherian local ring and prove that any power of the maximal ideal \mathfrak{m} has its property if the associated graded ring G of \mathfrak{m} satisfies \text{depth} \ G \ge 2. As its application, we characterize two-dimensional excellent normal local domains so that \mathfrak{m} is a p_g-ideal. Finally we ask what \mathfrak{m}-primary ideals have SRP and state a conjecture which characterizes the case when \mathfrak{m}^n are the only ideals which have SRP.
