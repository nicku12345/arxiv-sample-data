A recent continuous family of multiplicity functions on local rings was introduced by Taylor interpolating between Hilbert-Samuel and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities. The obvious goal is to use this as a tool for deforming results from one to the other. The values in this family which do not match these classic variants however are not known yet to be well-behaved. This article explores lower bounds for these intermediate multiplicities as well as gives evidence for analogies of the Watanabe-Yoshida minimality conjectures for unmixed singular rings.
