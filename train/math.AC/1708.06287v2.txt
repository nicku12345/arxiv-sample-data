This article generalizes joint work of the first author and I. Swanson to the s-multiplicity recently introduced by the second author. For k a field and X = [ x_{i,j}] a m \times n-matrix of variables, we utilize Gr\"obner bases to give a closed form the length \lambda( k[X] / (I_2(X) + \mathfrak{m}^{ \lceil sq \rceil} + \mathfrak{m}^{[q]} )) where s \in \mathbf{Z}[p^{-1}], q is a sufficiently large power of p, and \mathfrak{m} is the homogeneous maximal ideal of k[X]. This shows this length is always eventually a {\it polynomial} function of q for all s.
