Given a field F of \operatorname{char}(F)=2, we define u^n(F) to be the maximal dimension of an anisotropic form in I_q^n F. For n=1 it recaptures the definition of u(F). We study the relations between this value and the symbol length of H_2^n(F), denoted by sl_2^n(F). We show for any n \geq 2 that if 2^n \leq u^n(F) \leq u^2(F) < \infty then sl_2^n(F) \leq \prod_{i=2}^n (\frac{u^i(F)}{2}+1-2^{i-1}). As a result, if u(F) is finite then sl_2^n(F) is finite for any n, a fact which was previously proven when \operatorname{char}(F) \neq 2 by Saltman and Krashen. We also show that if sl_2^n(F)=1 then u^n(F) is either 2^n or 2^{n+1}.
