We give upper bounds for the Stanley depth of edge ideals of certain k-partite clutters. In particular, we generalize a result of Ishaq about the Stanley depth of the edge ideal of a complete bipartite graph. A result of Pournaki, Seyed Fakhari and Yassemi implies that the Stanley's conjecture holds for d-uniform complete d-partite clutters. Here we give a shorter and different proof of this fact.
