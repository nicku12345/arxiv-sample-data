Let R be a ring, let \mathfrak{a}\subseteq R be an ideal, and let M be an R-module. Let \Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}} denote the \mathfrak{a}-torsion functor. Conditions are given for the (weakly) associated primes of \Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}}(M) to be the (weakly) associated primes of M containing \mathfrak{a}, and for the (weakly) associated primes of M/\Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}}(M) to be the (weakly) associated primes of M not containing \mathfrak{a}.
