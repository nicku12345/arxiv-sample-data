Let k be a field of characteristic zero, let R be the ring of formal power series in n variables over k and let D(R,k) be the ring of k-linear differential operators in R. If M is a finitely generated D(R,k)-module then d(M)\geq n where d(M) is the dimension of M. This inequality is called the Bernstein inequality. We provide a short proof.
