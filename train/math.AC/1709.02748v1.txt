We give an elementary proof prove of the preservation of the Noetherian condition for commutative rings with unity R having at least one finitely generated ideal I such that the quotient ring is again finitely generated, and R is I-adically complete. Moreover, we offer as a direct corollary a new elementary proof of the fact that if a ring is Noetherian then the corresponding ring of formal power series in finitely many variables is Noetherian. In addition, we give a counterexample showing that the `completion' condition cannot be avoided on the former theorem. Lastly, we give an elementary characterization of Noetherian commutative rings that can be decomposed as a finite direct product of fields.
