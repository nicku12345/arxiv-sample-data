In this paper we study the Freiman inequality for the minimal number of generators of the square of an equigenerated monomial ideal. Such an ideal is called a Freiman ideal if equality holds in the Freiman inequality. We classify all Freiman ideals of maximal height, the Freiman ideals of certain classes of principal Borel ideals, the Hibi ideals which are Freiman, and classes of Veronese type ideals which are Freiman.
