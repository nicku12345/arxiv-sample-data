We investigate the Rees algebra and the toric ring of the squarefree monomial ideal associated to the three-dimensional Ferrers diagram. Under the projection property condition, we describe explicitly the presentation ideals of the Rees algebra and the toric ring. We show that the toric ring is a Koszul Cohen--Macaulay normal domain, while the Rees algebra is Koszul and the defining ideal is of fiber type.
