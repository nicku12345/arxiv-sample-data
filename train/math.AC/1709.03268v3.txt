Inspired by the works in linkage theory of ideals, we define the concept of linkage of ideals over a module. Several known theorems in linkage theory are improved or recovered by new approaches. Specially, we make some extensions and generalizations of the basic result of Peskine and Szpiro \cite[prop 1.3]{PS}, namely if R is a Gorenstain local ring, \mathfrak{a} \neq 0 (an ideal of R) and \mathfrak{b} := 0:_R \mathfrak{a} then \frac{R}{\mathfrak{a}} is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if \frac{R}{\mathfrak{a}} is unmixed and \frac{R}{\mathfrak{b}} is Cohen-Macaulay.
