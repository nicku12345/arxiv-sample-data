This dissertation focuses on the following topics: (1) asymptotic prime divisors over complete intersection rings, (2) asymptotic stability of complexities over complete intersection rings, (3) asymptotic linear bounds of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity in multigraded modules, and (4) characterizations of regular local rings via syzygy modules of the residue field.
