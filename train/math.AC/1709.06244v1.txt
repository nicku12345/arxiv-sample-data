Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be an analytically unramified formally equidimensional Noetherian local ring with \ depth \ A \geq 2. Let I be an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal and set I^* to be the integral closure of I. Set G^*(I) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} (I^n)^*/(I^{n+1})^* be the associated graded ring of the integral closure filtration of I. We prove that \ depth \ G^*(I^n) \geq 2 for all n \gg 0. As an application we prove that if A is also an excellent normal domain containing an algebraically closed field isomorphic to A/\m then there exists s_0 such that for all s \geq s_0 and J is an integrally closed ideal \emph{strictly} containing (\mathfrak{m}^s)^* then we have a strict inequality \mu(J) < \mu((\mathfrak{m}^s)^*) (here \mu(J) is the number of minimal generators of J).
