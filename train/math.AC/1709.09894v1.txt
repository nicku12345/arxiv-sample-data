Let A be a regular domain containing a field K of characteristic zero, G be a finite subgroup of the group of automorphisms of A and B=A^G be the ring of invariants of G. Let S= A[X_1,\ldots, X_m] and R= B[X_1, \ldots, X_m] be standard graded with \ deg \ A=0, \ deg \ B=0 and \ deg \ X_i=1 for all i. Extend the action of G on A to S by fixing X_i. Note S^G=R. Let I be an arbitrary homogeneous ideal in R. The main goal of this paper is to establish a comparative study of graded components of local cohomology modules H_I^i(R) that would be analogs to those proven in a previous paper of the first author for H_J^i(S) where J is an arbitrary homogeneous ideal in S.
