Factoring ideals in integral domains is a central topic in multiplicative ideal theory. In the present paper we study monoids of ideals and consider factorizations of ideals into multiplicatively irreducible ideals. The focus is on the monoid of nonzero divisorial ideals and on the monoid of v-invertible divisorial ideals in weakly Krull Mori domains. Under suitable algebraic finiteness conditions we establish arithmetical finiteness results, in particular for the monotone catenary degree and for the structure of sets of lengths and of their unions.
