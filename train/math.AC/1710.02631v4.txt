Throughout, let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. A ring R satisfies Serre's condition (S_{\ell}) if for all P \in \Spec R, \depth R_P \geq \min \{ \ell , \dim R_P \}. Serre's condition has been a topic of expanding interest. In this paper, we examine a generalization of Serre's condition (S_{\ell}^j). We say a ring satisfies (S_{\ell}^j) when \depth R_P \geq \min \{ \ell , \dim R_P -j \} for all P \in \Spec R. We prove generalizations of results for rings satisfying Serre's condition.
