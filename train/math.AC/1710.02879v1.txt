H. Bass defined orthogonal transvection group of an orthogonal module and elementary orthogonal transvection group of an orthogonal module with a hyperbolic direct summand. We also have the notion of relative orthogonal transvection group and relative elementary orthogonal transvection group with respect to an ideal of the ring. According to the definition of Bass relative elementary orthogonal transvection group is a subgroup of relative orthogonal transvection group of an orthogonal module with hyperbolic direct summand. Here we show that these two groups are the same in the case when the orthogonal module splits locally.
