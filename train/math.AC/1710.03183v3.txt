We solve the inverse differential Galois problem over differential fields with a large field of constants of infinite transcendence degree over {\mathbb Q}. More generally, we show that over such a field, every split differential embedding problem can be solved. In particular, we solve the inverse differential Galois problem and all split differential embedding problems over {\mathbb Q}_p(x).
