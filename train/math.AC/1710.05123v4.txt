Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring and M,N be finitely generated R-modules. We prove a number of results of the form: if \mbox{Hom}_R(M,N) has some nice properties and \mbox{Ext}^{1 \leq i \leq n}_R(M,N)=0 for some n, then M (and sometimes N) must be be close to free. Our methods are quite elementary, yet they suffice to give a unified treatment, simplify, and sometimes extend a number of results in the literature.
