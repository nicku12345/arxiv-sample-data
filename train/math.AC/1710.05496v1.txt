We investigate prime avoidance for an arbitrary set of prime ideals in a commutative ring. Various necessary and/or sufficient conditions for prime avoidance are given, which yield natural classes of infinite sets of primes that satisfy prime avoidance. Examples and counterexamples are given throughout to illustrate the phenomena that can occur. As an application, we show how to use prime avoidance to construct counterexamples among rings essentially of finite type.
