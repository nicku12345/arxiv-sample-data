Let k be a positive integer. We compute depth and Stanley depth of the quotient ring of the edge ideal associated to the k^{th} power of a path on n vertices. We show that both depth and Stanley depth have the same values and can be given in terms of k and n. For n\geq 2k+1, let n\equiv 0,k+1,k+2,\dots, n-1(\mod(2k+1)). Then we give values of depth and Stanley depth of the quotient ring of the edge ideal associated to the k^{th} power of a cycle on n vertices and tight bounds otherwise, in terms of n and k. We also compute lower bounds for the Stanley depth of the edge ideals associated to the k^{th} power of a path and a cycle and prove a conjecture of Herzog presented in \cite{HS} for these ideals.
