Let D be an integral domain and \star  a star operation defined on D. We say that D is a \star -power conductor domain (\star -PCD) if for each pair a,b\in D\backslash (0) and for each positive integer n we have Da^{n}\cap Db^{n}=((Da\cap Db)^{n})^{\ast }. We study \star -PCDs and characterize them as root closed domains satisfying  ((a,b)^{n})^{-1}=(((a,b)^{-1})^{n})^{\star } for all nonzero a,b and all natural numbers n\geq 1. From this it follows easily that Pr\"{u}fer domains are d-PCDs (where d denotes the trivial star operation), and v -domains (e.g., Krull domains) are v-PCDs, thereby establishing that a v -domain (e.g., a Prufer or Krull domain) is a \star  -PCD. We also consider when a \star -PCD is completely integrally closed, and this leads to new characterizations of Krulll domains. In particular, we show that a Noetherian domain is a Krull domain if and only if it is a w -PCD.
