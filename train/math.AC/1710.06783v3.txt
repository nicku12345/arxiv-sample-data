Let D be a Dedekind domain with infinitely many maximal ideals, all of finite index, and K its quotient field. Let \operatorname{Int}(D) = \{f\in K[x] \mid f(D) \subseteq D\} be the ring of integer-valued polynomials on D. Given any finite multiset \{k_1, \ldots, k_n\} of integers greater than 1, we construct a polynomial in \operatorname{Int}(D) which has exactly n essentially different factorizations into irreducibles in \operatorname{Int}(D), the lengths of these factorizations being k_1, \ldots, k_n. We also show that there is no transfer homomorphism from the multiplicative monoid of \operatorname{Int}(D) to a block monoid.
