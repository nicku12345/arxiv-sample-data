A conjecture of Huneke and Wiegand claims that, over one-dimensional commutative Noetherian local domains, the tensor product of a finitely generated, non-free, torsion-free module with its algebraic dual always has torsion. Building on a beautiful result of Corso, Huneke, Katz and Vasconcelos, we prove that the conjecture is affirmative for a large class of ideals over arbitrary one-dimensional local domains. Furthermore we study a higher dimensional analog of the conjecture for integrally closed ideals over Noetherian rings that are not necessarily local. We also consider a related question on the conjecture and give an affirmative answer for first syzygies of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules.
