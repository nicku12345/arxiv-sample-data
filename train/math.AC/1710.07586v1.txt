This paper is focused on numerical semigroups and presents a simple construction, that we call dilatation, which, from a starting semigroup S, permits to get an infinite family of semigroups which share several properties with S. The invariants of each semigroup T of this family are given in terms of the corresponding invariants of S and the Ap\'ery set and the minimal generators of T are also described. We also study three properties that are close to the Gorenstein property of the associated semigroup ring: almost Gorenstein, 2-AGL, and nearly Gorenstein properties. More precisely, we prove that S satisfies one of these properties if and only if each dilatation of S satisfies the corresponding one.
