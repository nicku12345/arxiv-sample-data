We study strong indispensability of minimal free resolutions of semigroup rings. We focus on two operations, gluing and extending, used in literature to produce more examples with a special property from the existing ones. We give a naive condition to determine whether gluing of two semigroup rings has a strongly indispensable minimal free resolution. As applications, we determine extensions of 3-generated non-symmetric, 4-generated symmetric and pseudo symmetric numerical semigroups as well as obtain infinitely many complete intersection semigroups of any embedding dimension, having strongly indispensable minimal free resolutions.
