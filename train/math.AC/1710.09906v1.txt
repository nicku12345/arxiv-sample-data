Let R be a commutative ring. We show that any complete duality pair gives rise to a theory of relative homological algebra, analogous to Gorenstein homological algebra. Indeed Gorenstein homological algebra over a commutative Noetherian ring of finite Krull dimension can be recovered from the duality pair (\mathcal{F},\mathcal{I}) where \mathcal{F} is the class of flat R-modules and \mathcal{I} is the class of injective R-modules. For a general R, the AC-Gorenstein homological algebra of Bravo-Gillespie-Hovey is the one coming from the duality pair (\mathcal{L},\mathcal{A}) where \mathcal{L} is the class of level R-modules and \mathcal{A} is class of absolutely clean R-modules. Indeed we show here that the work of Bravo-Gillespie-Hovey can be extended to obtain similar abelian model structures on R-Mod from any a complete duality pair (\mathcal{L},\mathcal{A}). It applies in particular to the original duality pairs constructed by Holm-J{\o} rgensen.
