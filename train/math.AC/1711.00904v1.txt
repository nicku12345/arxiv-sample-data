We compute by hand all quadratic homogeneous polynomial maps H and all Keller maps of the form x + H, for which {\rm rk} J H = 3, over a field of arbitrary characteristic.   Furthermore, we use computer support to compute Keller maps of the form x + H with {\rm rk} J H = 4, namely:   \bullet all such maps in dimension 5 over fields with \frac12;   \bullet all such maps in dimension 6 over fields without \frac12.   We use these results to prove the following over fields of arbitrary characteristic: for Keller maps x + H for which {\rm rk} J H \le 4, the rows of J H are dependent over the base field.
