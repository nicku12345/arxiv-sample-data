Let R be a commutative ring with unity, M be an unitary R-module and {\Gamma} be a simple graph. This research article is an interplay of combinatorial and algebraic properties of M . We show a combinatorial object completely determines an algebraic object and characterise all finite abelian groups. We discuss the correspondence between essential ideals of R, submodules of M and vertices of graphs arising from M . We examine various types of equivalence relations on objects of M. We study essential ideals corresponding to elements of an object over hereditary and regular rings. Further, we study isomorphism of annihilating graphs arising from M and tensor product.
