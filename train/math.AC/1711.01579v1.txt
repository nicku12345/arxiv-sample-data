Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and \fa an ideal of R. We intend to establish the dual of two Faltings' Theorems for local homology modules of an Artinian module. As a consequence of this, we show that, if A is an Artinian module over semi-local complete ring R and j is an integer such that H_i^{\fa}(A) is Artinian for all i<j, then the set \Coass_R(H_j^{\fa}(A)) is finite. We also introduce the notion of the nth Artinianness dimension g_n^\fa(A)=\inf\{g^{\fa R_{\fp}}(^\fp A): \fp\in\Spec(R) \ \ \text{and} \ \ \dim R/\fp\geq n\}, for all n\in\mathbb{N}_{0} and prove that g_1^\fa(A)=\inf\{i\in\mathbb{N}_0: H_i^\fa(A) \ \ \text{is not minimax}\}, whenever R is a semi-local complete ring. Moreover, in this situation we show that \Coass_R(H_{g_1^\fa(A)}^\fa(A)) is a finite set.
