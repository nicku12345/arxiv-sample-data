Let S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n] denote the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K with each \deg x_i = 1 and I \subset S a homogeneous ideal of S with \dim S/I = d. The Hilbert series of S/I is of the form h_{S/I}(\lambda)/(1 - \lambda)^d, where h_{S/I}(\lambda) = h_0 + h_1\lambda + h_2\lambda^2 + \cdots + h_s\lambda^s with h_s \neq 0 is the h-polynomial of S/I. It is known that, when S/I is Cohen--Macaulay, one has \reg(S/I) = \deg h_{S/I}(\lambda), where \reg(S/I) is the (Castelnuovo--Mumford) regularity of S/I. In the present paper, given arbitrary integers r and s with r \geq 1 and s \geq 1, a monomial ideal I of S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n] with n \gg 0 for which \reg(S/I) = r and \deg h_{S/I}(\lambda) = s will be constructed. Furthermore, we give a class of edge ideals I \subset S of Cameron--Walker graphs with \reg(S/I) = \deg h_{S/I}(\lambda) for which S/I is not Cohen--Macaulay.
