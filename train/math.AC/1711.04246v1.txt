Let \Gamma be a torsionless commutative cancellative monoid, R =\bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Gamma}R_{\alpha} be a \Gamma-graded integral domain, and H be the set of nonzero homogeneous elements of R. In this paper, we show that if Q is a maximal t-ideal of R with Q \cap H = \emptyset, then R_Q is a valuation domain. We then use this result to give simple proofs of the facts that (i) R is a UMT-domain if and only if R_Q is a quasi-Pr\"ufer domain for each homogeneous maximal t-ideal Q of R and (ii) R is a PvMD if and only if every nonzero finitely generated homogeneous ideal of R is t-invertible, if and only if R_Q is a valuation domain for all homogeneous maximal t-ideals Q of R. Let D[\Gamma] be the monoid domain of \Gamma over an integral domain D. We also show that D[\Gamma] is a UMT-domain if and only if D is a UMT-domain and the integral closure of \Gamma_S is a valuation monoid for all maximal t-ideals S of \Gamma. Hence, D[\Gamma] is a PvMD if and only if D is a PvMD and \Gamma is a PvMS.
