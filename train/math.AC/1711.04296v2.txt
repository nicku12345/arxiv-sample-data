In this paper we establish the relation between key polynomials (as defined in \cite{SopivNova}) and minimal pairs of definition of a valuation. We also discuss truncations of valuations on a polynomial ring K[x]. We prove that a valuation \nu is equal to its truncation on some polynomial if and only if \nu is valuation-transcendental. Another important result of this paper is that if \mu is any extension of \nu to \overline K[x] and \Lambda is a complete sequence of key polynomials for \nu, without last element, then for each Q\in \Lambda there exists a suitable root a_Q\in \overline K of Q such that \{a_Q\}_{Q\in \Lambda} is a pseudo-convergent sequence defining \mu.
