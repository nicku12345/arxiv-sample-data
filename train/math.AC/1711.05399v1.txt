A class of integer-valued functions defined on the set of ideals of an integral domain R is investigated. We show that this class of functions, which we call ideal valuations, are in one-to-one correspondence with countable descending chains of finite type, stable semistar operations with largest element equal to the e-operation. We use this class of functions to recover familiar semistar operations such as the w-operation and to give a solution to a conjecture by Chapman and Glaz when the ring is a valuation domain.
