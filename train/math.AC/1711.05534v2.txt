Let R be a commutative noetherian ring, and \mathcal{Z} a stable under specialization subset of \Spec(R). We introduce a notion of \mathcal{Z}-cofiniteness and study its main properties. In the case \dim(\mathcal{Z})\leq 1, or \dim(R)\leq 2, or R is semilocal with \cd(\mathcal{Z},R) \leq 1, we show that the category of \mathcal{Z}-cofinite R-modules is abelian. Also, in each of these cases, we prove that the local cohomology module H^{i}_{\mathcal{Z}}(X) is \mathcal{Z}-cofinite for every homologically left-bounded R-complex X whose homology modules are finitely generated and every i \in \mathbb{Z}.
