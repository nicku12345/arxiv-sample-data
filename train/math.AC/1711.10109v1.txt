In 1961, Gerstenhaber proved the following theorem: if k is a field and X and Y are commuting dxd matrices with entries in k, then the unital k-algebra generated by these matrices has dimension at most d. The analog of this statement for four or more commuting matrices is false. The three matrix version remains open. We use commutative-algebraic techniques to prove that the three matrix analog of Gerstenhaber's theorem is true for some new classes of examples.   In particular, we translate this three commuting matrix statement into an equivalent statement about certain maps between modules, and prove that this commutative-algebraic reformulation is true in special cases. We end with ideas for an inductive approach intended to handle the three matrix analog of Gerstenhaber's theorem more generally.
