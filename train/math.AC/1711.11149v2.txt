Let \Lambda be a numerical semigroup, \mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n the monomial curve singularity associated to \Lambda, and \mathcal{T} its tangent cone. In this paper we provide a sharp upper bound for the least positive integer in \Lambda in terms of the codimension and the maximum degree of the equations of \mathcal{T}, when \mathcal{T} is not a complete intersection. A special case of this result settles a question of J. Herzog and D. Stamate.
