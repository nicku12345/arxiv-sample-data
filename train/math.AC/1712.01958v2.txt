We study a notion of dimension which was introduced by R. Heitmann in his remarkable paper in 1984, and also a related notion, implicit in the proofs in his paper. We develop these notions in the general framework of distributive lattices and spectral spaces. We obtain in this way constructive versions of important theorems in commutative algebra, with simpler proofs than the classical ones, and some new results.
