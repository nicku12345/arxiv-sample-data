We provide a direct computation of the F-pure threshold of degree four homogeneous polynomial in two variables and, more generally, of certain homogeneous polynomials with four distinct roots. The computation depends on whether the cross ratio of the roots satisfies a specific M\"{o}bius transformation of a Legendre polynomial. We then make a connection between a long lasting open question, involving the relationship between the F-pure and the log canonical threshold, and roots of Legendre polynomials over \mathbb{F}_p.
