This paper introduces the notion of an excellent quotient, which is stronger than a universal geometric quotient. The main result is that for an action of a connected solvable group G on an affine scheme Spec(R) there exists a semi-invariant f such that Spec(R_f) \to Spec((R_f)^G) is an excellent quotient. The paper contains an algorithm for computing f and (R_f)^G. If R is a polynomial ring over a field, the algorithm requires no Gr\"obner basis computations, and it also computes a presentation of (R_f)^G. In this case, (R_f)^G is a complete intersection. The existence of an excellent quotient extends to actions on quasi-affine schemes.
