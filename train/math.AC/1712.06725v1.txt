For a finite-type star operation \star on a domain R, we say that R is \star-super potent if each maximal \star-ideal of R contains a finitely generated ideal I such that (1) I is contained in no other maximal \star-ideal of R and (2) J is \star-invertible for every finitely generated ideal J \supseteq I. Examples of t-super potent domains include domains each of whose maximal t-ideals is t-invertible (e.g., Krull domains). We show that if the domain R is \star-super potent for some finite-type star operation \star, then R is t-super potent, we study t-super potency in polynomial rings and pullbacks, and we prove that a domain R is a generalized Krull domain if and only if it is % t -super potent and has t-dimension one.
