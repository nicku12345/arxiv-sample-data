Let m, n > 1 be two integers, and \mathbb{Z}_n be a \mathbb{Z}_m-module. Let I(\mathbb{Z}_m)^* be the set of all non- zero proper ideals of \mathbb{Z}_m. The \mathbb{Z}_n-intersection graph of \mathbb{Z}_m, denoted by G_n(\mathbb{Z}_m) is a graph with the vertex set I(\mathbb{Z}_m)^*, and two distinct vertices I and J are adjacent if and only if I\mathbb{Z}_n\cap J\mathbb{Z}_n\neq 0. In this paper, we determine the values of m and n for which G_n(\mathbb{Z}_m) is planar, outerplanar or ring graph.
