Gr\"obner bases have been generalized by replacing monomial orders with constructions such as valuations and filtrations. We consider suitable valuations on a rational valuation field K(x,y) and analyze their behavior when restricting to an underlying polynomial ring K[x,y]. In previous work, the corresponding value groups were subsets of {\mathbb Q}, and in this paper we consider the case when the value groups are isomorphic to {\mathbb Z} \oplus {\mathbb Z}. Bounds on how the image of K[x,y] grows with respect to degree are given, and then a class a valuations that are suitable for use for generalized Gr\"obner bases are described. We construct an example in which the image of the underlying polynomial ring is non-negative, yet is not well-ordered.
