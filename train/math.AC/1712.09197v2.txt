Let A be a regular ring containing a field K of characteristic zero and let R = A[X_1,\ldots, X_m]. Consider R as standard graded with \deg A = 0 and \deg X_i = 1 for all i. Let G be a finite subgroup of GL_m(A). Let G act linearly on R fixing A. Let S = R^G. In this paper we present a comprehensive study of graded components of local cohomology modules H^i_I(S) where I is an \emph{arbitrary} homogeneous ideal in S. We prove stronger results when G \subseteq GL_m(K). Some of our results are new even in the case when A is a field.
