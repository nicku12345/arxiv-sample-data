Let (A,\mathfrak{m},\Bbbk) denote a local Noetherian ring and \mathfrak{q} an ideal such that \ell_A(M/\mathfrak{q}M) < \infty for a finitely generated A-module M. Let \au = a_1,\ldots,a_d denote a system of parameters of M such that a_i \in \mathfrak{q}^{c_i} \setminus \mathfrak{q}^{c_i+1} for i=1,\ldots,d. It follows that  \chi := e_0(\au;M) - c \cdot e_0(\mathfrak{q};M) \geq 0, where c = c_1\cdot \ldots \cdot c_d. The main results of the report are a discussion when \chi = 0 resp. to describe the value of \chi in some particular cases. Applications concern results on the multiplicity e_0(\au;M) and applications to Bezout numbers.
