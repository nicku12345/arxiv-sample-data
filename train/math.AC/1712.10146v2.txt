Let \mathfrak{q} denote an ideal of a local ring (A,\mathfrak{m}). For a system of elements \underline{a} = a_1,\ldots,a_t such that a_i \in \mathfrak{q}^{c_i}, i = 1, \ldots,t, and n \in \mathbb{Z} we investigate a subcomplex resp. a factor complex of the \v{C}ech complex \check{C}_{\underline{a}} \otimes_A M for a finitely generated A-module M. We start with the inspection of these cohomology modules that approximate in a certain sense the local cohomology modules H^i_{\underline{a}}(M) for all i \in \mathbb{N}. In the case of an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal \underline{a} A we prove the Artinianness of these cohomology modules and characterize the last non-vanishing among them.
