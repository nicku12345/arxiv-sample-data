Let R = S/I be a quotient of a standard graded polynomial ring S by an ideal I generated by quadrics. If R is Koszul, a question of Avramov, Conca, and Iyengar asks whether the Betti numbers of R over S can be bounded above by binomial coefficients on the minimal number of generators of I. Motivated by previous results for Koszul algebras defined by three quadrics, we give a complete classification of the structure of Koszul almost complete intersections and, in the process, give an affirmative answer to the above question for all such rings.
