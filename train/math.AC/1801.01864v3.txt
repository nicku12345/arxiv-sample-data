Set  A := Q/({\bf z}) , where  Q  is a polynomial ring over a field, and  {\bf z} = z_1,\ldots,z_c  is a homogeneous  Q -regular sequence. Let  M  and  N  be finitely generated graded  A -modules, and  I  be a homogeneous ideal of  A . We show that   (1)  \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M, I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 ,   (2)  \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M,N/I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b' \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 ,   where  b  and  b'  are some constants,  f := \mathrm{min}\{ \mathrm{deg}(z_j) : 1 \le j \le c \} , and  \rho_N(I)  is an invariant defined in terms of reduction ideals of  I  with respect to  N . There are explicit examples which show that these inequalities are sharp.
