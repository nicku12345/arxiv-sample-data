For every simple graph G, a class of multiple clique cluster-whiskered graphs G^{md} is introduced, and it is shown that all graphs G^{md} are vertex decomposable, thus the independence simplicial complex {\rm Ind}\,G^{md} is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay; the properties of the graphs G^{md} and the clique-whiskered graph G^\pi are studied, including the enumeration of facets of the complex {\rm Ind}\, G^{\pi} and, the calculation of Betti numbers of the cover ideal I_c(G^{md}).
