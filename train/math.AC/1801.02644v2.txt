For a finite subset M\subset [x_1,\ldots,x_d] of monomials, we describe how to constructively obtain a monomial ideal I\subseteq R = K[x_1,\ldots,x_d] such that the set of monomials in \text{Soc}(I)\setminus I is precisely M, or such that \overline{M}\subseteq R/I is a K-basis for the the socle of R/I. For a given M we obtain a natural class of monomials I with this property. This is done by using solely the lattice structure of the monoid [x_1,\ldots,x_d]. We then present some duality results by using anti-isomorphisms between upsets and downsets of (\mathbb Z^d,\preceq). Finally, we define and analyze zero-dimensional monomial ideals of R of type k, where type 1 are exactly the Artinian Gorenstein ideals, and describe the structure of such ideals that correspond to order-generic antichains in \mathbb Z^d.
