The aim of the article is to study the minimal free resolution of the tangent cone of Gorenstein monomial curves in affine 4-space. If C is a non-complete intersection Gorenstein monomial curve that the minimal number of generators of its tangent cone is five, we give the explicit minimal free resolution of the tangent cone of these families of curves and show that the possible Betti sequences are (1,5,6,2) and (1,5,5,1). Also, we give the minimal graded free resolution and compute the Hilbert function of the tangent cone of these families as a result.
