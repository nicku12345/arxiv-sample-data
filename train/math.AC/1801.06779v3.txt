In this paper, a semigroup algebra consisting of polynomial expressions with coefficients in a field F and exponents in an additive submonoid M of \mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0} is called a Puiseux algebra and denoted by F[M]. Here we study the atomic structure of Puiseux algebras. To begin with, we answer the Isomorphism Problem for the class of Puiseux algebras, that is, we show that for a field F if two Puiseux algebras F[M_1] and F[M_2] are isomorphic, then the monoids M_1 and M_2 are also isomorphic. Then we construct three classes of Puiseux algebras satisfying the following well-known atomic properties: the ACCP property, the bounded factorization property, and the finite factorization property. Finally, we give a full description of the seminormal closure, root closure, and complete integral closure of a Puiseux algebra, and use such description to provide a class of antimatter Puiseux algebras (i.e., Puiseux algebras containing no irreducibles).
