Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, \fa be an ideal of R and M be an R-module. It is shown that if \Ext^i_R(R/\fa,M) is minimax for all i\leq \dim M, then the R-module \Ext^i_R(N,M) is minimax for all i\geq 0 and for any finitely generated R-module N with \Supp_R(N) \subseteq V (\fa) and \dim N \leq 1. As a consequence of this result we obtain that for any \fa-torsion R-module M that \Ext^i_R(R/\fa, M) is minimax for all i\leq \dim M, all Bass numbers and all Betti numbers of M are finite. This generalizes \cite[Corollary 2.7]{BNS2015}. Also, some equivalent conditions for the cominimaxness of local cohomology modules with respect to ideals of dimension at most one are given.
