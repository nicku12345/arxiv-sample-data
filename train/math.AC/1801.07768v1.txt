Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, \fa be an ideal of R and M be an R-module. The main purpose of this paper is to answer the Hartshorn's questions in the class of weakly Laskerian modules. It is shown that if s\geq 1 is a positive integer such that \Ext^j_R(R/\fa, M) is weakly Laskerian for all j\leq s and the R-module H^i_\fa(M) is FD_{\leq 1} for all i < s, then the R-module H^i_\fa(M) is \fa-weakly cofinite for all i <s. In addition, we show that the category of all \fa-weakly cofinite FD_{\leq 1} R-modules is an Abelian subcategory of the category of all R-modules. Also, we prove that if \Ext^i_R(R/\fa,M) is weakly Laskerian for all i\leq \dim M, then the R-module \Ext^i_R(N,M) is weakly Laskerian for all i\geq 0 and for any finitely generated R-module N with \Supp_R(N) \subseteq V (\fa) and \dim N \leq 1.
