Let R be a polynomial ring over a field and I an ideal generated by three forms of degree three. Motivated by Stillman's question, Engheta proved that the projective dimension \mathrm{pd}(R/I) of R/I is at most 36, although the example with largest projective dimension he constructed has \mathrm{pd}(R/I)=5. Based on computational evidence, it had been conjectured that \mathrm{pd}(R/I)\leq 5. In the present paper we prove this conjectured sharp bound.
