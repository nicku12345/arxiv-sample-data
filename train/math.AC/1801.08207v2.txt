In this work, we prove that if a graded, commutative algebra R over a field k is not Koszul then, denoting by \mathfrak{m} the maximal homogeneous ideal of R and by M a finitely generated graded R-module, the nonzero modules of the form \mathfrak{m} M have infinite Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. We also prove that over complete intersections which are not Koszul, a nonzero direct summand of a syzygy of k has infinite regularity. Finally, we relate the vanishing of the graded deviations of R to having a nonzero direct summand of a syzygy of k of finite regularity.
