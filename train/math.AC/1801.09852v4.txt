The purpose of this paper is to prove that certain limits of polynomial rings are themselves polynomial rings, and show how this observation can be used to deduce some interesting results in commutative algebra. In particular, we give two new proofs of Stillman's conjecture. The first is similar to that of Ananyan-Hochster, though more streamlined; in particular, it establishes the existence of small subalgebras. The second proof is completely different, and relies on a recent noetherianity result of Draisma.
