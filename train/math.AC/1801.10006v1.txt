This is a survey of recent advances in commutative algebra, especially in mixed characteristic, obtained by using the theory of perfectoid spaces. An explanation of these techniques and a short account of the author's proof of the direct summand conjecture are included. One then portrays the progresses made with these (and related) techniques on the so-called homological conjectures.
