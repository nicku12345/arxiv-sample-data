We prove the weak functoriality of (big) Cohen-Macaulay algebras, which controls the whole skein of "homological conjectures" in commutative algebra [H1][HH2].   Namely, for any local homomorphism  R\to R' of complete local domains, there exists a compatible homomorphism between some Cohen-Macaulay R-algebra and some Cohen-Macaulay R'-algebra.   When R contains a field, this is already known [[3.9]{HH2}]. When R is of mixed characteristic, our strategy of proof is reminiscent of G. Dietz's refined treatment [D] of weak functoriality of Cohen-Macaulay algebras in characteristic p; in fact, developing a "tilting argument" due to K. Shimomoto, we combine the perfectoid techniques of [A1][A2] with Dietz's result.
