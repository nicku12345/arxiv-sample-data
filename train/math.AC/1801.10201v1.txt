This paper is a survey on the study of the behaviour of the composition of polynomials on the computation of Gr\"obner bases. This survey brings together some works published between 1995 and 2007. The authors of these papers gave answers to some questions in this subject for several types of Gr\"obner bases, over different monomials orderings and over different polynomials rings. Some of these answers are complete and some are not. Some papers of them were given to answer some open questions given in the first published paper of these papers and other some were given to generalize previous work. Note that, there are many other works in this subject over other special cases and types of Gr\"obner bases under the usual definition over arbitrary fields, over other types of bases, under the non-commutative case and with other methods of proofs and calculations.
