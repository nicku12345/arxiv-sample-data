We construct a local Cohen-Macaulay ring R with a prime ideal \mathfrak{p}\in\spec(R) such that R satisfies the uniform Auslander condition (UAC), but the localization R_{\mathfrak{p}} does not satisfy Auslander's condition (AC). Given any positive integer n, we also construct a local Cohen-Macaulay ring R with a prime ideal \mathfrak{p}\in\spec(R) such that R has exactly two non-isomorphic semidualizing modules, but the localization R_{\mathfrak{p}} has 2^n non-isomorphic semidualizing modules. Each of these examples is constructed as a fiber product of two local rings over their common residue field. Additionally, we characterize the non-trivial Cohen-Macaulay fiber products of finite Cohen-Macaulay type.
