Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a local complete intersection ring and let I be an ideal in A. Let M, N be finitely generated A-modules. Then for l = 0,1, the values depth \ Ext^{2i+l}_A(M, N/I^nN) become independent of i, n for i,n \gg 0. We also show that if \mathfrak{p} is a prime ideal in A then the j^{th} Bass numbers \mu_j\big(\mathfrak{p},\ Ext^{2i+l}_A(M,N/{I^nN})\big) has polynomial growth in (n,i) with rational coefficients for all sufficiently large (n,i).
