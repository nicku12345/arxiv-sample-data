Let S be a polynomial ring over a field and I\subseteq S a homogeneous ideal containing a regular sequence of forms of degrees d_1, \ldots, d_c. In this paper we prove the Lex-plus-powers Conjecture when the field has characteristic 0 for all regular sequences such that d_i \geq \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (d_j-1)+1 for each i; that is, we show that the Betti table of I is bounded above by the Betti table of the lex-plus-powers ideal of I. As an application, when the characteristic is 0, we obtain bounds for the Betti numbers of any homogeneous ideal containing a regular sequence of known degrees, which are sharper than the previously known ones from the Bigatti-Hulett-Pardue Theorem.
