A result by C. C.-A. Cheng, J. H. Mckay and S. S.-S. Wang says the following: Suppose the Jacobian of A and B is invertible in \mathbb{C}[x,y] and the Jacobian of A and w is zero for A,B,w \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]. Then w \in \mathbb{C}[A]. We show that in CMW's result it is possible to replace \mathbb{C} by any field of characteristic zero, and we conjecture the following 'two-dimensional Centralizer Conjecture over D': Suppose the Jacobian of A and B is invertible in D[x,y] and the Jacobian of A and w is zero for A,B,w \in D[x,y], D is an integral domain of characteristic zero. Then w \in D[A]. We show that if the famous two-dimensional Jacobian Conjecture is true, then the two-dimensional Centralizer Conjecture is true.
