Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a Noetherian local ring and M a finitely generated R-module. We say M has maximal depth if there is an associated prime \mathfrak{p} of M such that depth M=\dim R/\mathfrak{p}. In this paper, we study finitely generated modules with maximal depth. It is shown that the maximal depth property is preserved under some important module operations. Generalized Cohen--Macaulay modules with maximal depth are classified. Finally, the attached primes of H^i_{\mathfrak{m}}(M) are considered for i<\mathrm{dim} M.
