Let \ast  be a finite character star operation defined on an integral domain D. Call a nonzero \ast -ideal I of finite type a \ast  -homogeneous (\ast -homog) ideal, if I\subsetneq D and (J+K)^{\ast }\neq D for every pair D\supsetneq J,K\supseteq I of proper \ast  -ideals of finite type. Call an integral domain D a \ast -Semi Homogeneous Domain (\ast -SHD) if every proper principal ideal xD of D is expressible as a \ast -product of finitely many \ast -homog ideals. We show that a \ast -SHD contains a family \mathcal{F} of prime ideals such that (a) D=\cap_{P\in \mathcal{F}}D_{P}, a locally finite intersection and (b) no two members of \mathcal{F} contain a common non zero prime ideal. The \ast -SHDs include h-local domains, independent rings of Krull type, Krull domains, UFDs etc. We show also that we can modify the definition of the \ast -homog ideals to get a theory of each special case of a \ast -SH domain.
