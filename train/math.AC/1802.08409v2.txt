Over an arbitrary commutative ring, correspondences among three sets, the set of trace ideals, the set of stable ideals, and the set of birational extensions of the base ring, are studied. The correspondences are well-behaved, if the base ring is a Gorenstein ring of dimension one. It is shown that with one extremal exception, the surjectivity of one of the correspondences characterizes the Gorenstein property of the base ring, provided it is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension one. Over a commutative Noetherian ring, a characterization of modules in which every submodule is a trace module is given. The notion of anti-stable rings is introduced, exploring their basic properties.
