We study the WLP and SLP of artinian monomial ideals in S=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\dots ,x_n] via studying their minimal free resolutions. We study the Lefschetz properties of such ideals where the minimal free resolution of S/I is linear for at least n-2 steps. We give an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Eisenbud, Huneke and Ulrich for artinian monomial ideals with almost linear resolutions.
