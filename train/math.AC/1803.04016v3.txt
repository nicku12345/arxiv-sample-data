Let R and S be polynomial rings of positive dimensions over a field k. Let I\subseteq R, J\subseteq S be non-zero homogeneous ideals none of which contains a linear form. Denote by F the fiber product of I and J in T=R\otimes_k S. We compute homological invariants of the powers of F using the data of I and J. Under the assumption that either \text{char}~ k=0 or I and J are monomial ideals, we provide explicit formulas for the depth and regularity of powers of F. In particular, we establish for all s\ge 2 the intriguing formula \text{depth}(T/F^s)=0. If moreover each of the ideals I and J is generated in a single degree, we show that for all s\ge 1, \text{reg}~ F^s=\max_{i\in [1,s]}\{\text{reg}~ I^i+s-i,\text{reg}~ J^i+s-i\}. Finally, we prove that the linearity defect of F is the maximum of the linearity defects of I and J, extending previous work of Conca and R\"omer. The proofs exploit the so-called Betti splittings of powers of a fiber product.
