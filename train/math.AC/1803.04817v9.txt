In this paper, new criteria for zero dimensional rings, Gelfand rings, clean rings and mp-rings are given. A new class of rings is introduced and studied, we call them purified rings. Specially, reduced purified rings are characterized. New characterizations for pure ideals of reduced Gelfand rings and mp-rings are provided. It is also proved that if the topology of a scheme is Hausdorff, then the affine opens of that scheme is stable under taking finite unions. In particular, every compact scheme is an affine scheme.
