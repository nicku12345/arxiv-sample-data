Let K be an infinite field and let I = (f_1,...,f_r) be an ideal in the polynomial ring R = K[x_1,...,x_n] generated by generic forms of degrees d_1,...,d_r. In the case r=n, following an effective method by Gao, Guan and Volny, we give a description of the initial ideal of I with respect to the degree reverse lexicographic order. Thanks to a theorem due to Pardue (2010), we apply our result to give a partial solution to a longstanding conjecture stated by Froeberg (1985) on the Hilbert series of R/I.
