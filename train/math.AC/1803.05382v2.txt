In this paper, we study the F-rationality of the Rees algebra and the extended Rees algebra of \mathfrak{m}-primary ideals in excellent local rings (R, \mathfrak{m}) of prime characteristic. We partially answer some conjectures and questions raised by N. Hara, K.-i. Watanabe and K.-i. Yoshida (J. Algebra, pp.153--190, vol 247, 2002).
