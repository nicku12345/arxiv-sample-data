Given a numerical semigroup ring R=k[\![S]\!], an ideal E of S and an odd element b \in S, the numerical duplication S \! \Join^b \! E is a numerical semigroup, whose associated ring k[\![S \! \Join^b \! E]\!] shares many properties with the Nagata's idealization and the amalgamated duplication of R along the monomial ideal I=(t^e \mid e\in E). In this paper we study the associated graded ring of the numerical duplication characterizing when it is Cohen-Macaulay, Gorenstein or complete intersection. We also study when it is a homogeneous numerical semigroup, a property that is related to the fact that a ring has the same Betti numbers of its associated graded ring. On the way we also characterize when {\rm gr}_{\mathfrak m}(I) is Cohen-Macaulay and when {\rm gr}_{\mathfrak m}(\omega_R) is a canonical module of {\rm gr}_{\mathfrak m}(R) in terms of numerical semigroup's properties, where \omega_R is a canonical module of R.
