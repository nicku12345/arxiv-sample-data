We characterize extensions of commutative rings R\subset S such that R\subset T is minimal for each R-subalgebra T of S with T\neq R,S. This property is equivalent to R\subset S has length 2. Such extensions are either pointwise minimal or simple. We are able to compute the number of subextensions of R\subset S. Besides commutative algebra considerations, our main result is a consequence of the recently introduced by van Hoeij et al. concept of principal subfields of a finite separable field extension. As a corollary of this paper, we get that simple extensions of length 2 have FIP.
