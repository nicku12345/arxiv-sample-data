Let K be a field and let S=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} S_n be a positively graded K-algebra. Given M=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} M_n, a finitely generated graded S-module, and w>0, we introduce the function \zeta_M(z,w):= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{H(M,n)}{(n+w)^z}, where H(M,n):=\dim_K M_n, n\geq 0, is the Hilbert function of M, and we study the relations between the algebraic properties of M and the analytic properties of \zeta_M(z,w). In particular, in the standard graded case, we prove that the multiplicity of M, e(M)=(m-1)!\lim_{w\searrow 0}Res_{z=m}\zeta_M(z,w).
