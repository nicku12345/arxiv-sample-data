In this paper, we introduce the notion of Ratliff-Rush closure of modules and explore whether the condition of the Ratliff-Rush closure coincides with the integral closure. The main result characterizes the condition in terms of the normality of the projective scheme of the Rees algebra, which generalizes the result of S. Goto and N. Matsuoka. In conclusion, we shall give a criterion for the Buchsbaum Rees algebras.
