In this paper we prove the existence of a uniform bound for Frobenius test exponents for parameter ideals of a local ring (R, \frak m) of prime characteristic in the following cases: (1) R is generalized Cohen-Macaulay. Our proof is much more simpler than the original proof of Huneke, Katzman, Sharp and Yao, (2) The Frobenius actions on all lower local cohomologies H^i_{\frak m}(R), i < \dim R, are nilpotent.
