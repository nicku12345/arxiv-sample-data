Let {\cal R}_{\mathbb{K}}[H] be the Hibi ring over a field \mathbb{K} on a finite distributive lattice H, P the set of join-irreducible elements of H and \omega the canonical ideal of {\cal R}_{\mathbb{K}}[H]. We show the powers \omega^{(n)} of \omega in the group of divisors \mathrm{Div}({\cal R}_{\mathbb{K}}[H]) is identical with the ordinal powers of \omega, describe the \mathbb{K}-vector space basis of \omega^{(n)} for n\in\mathbb{Z}. Further, we show that the fiber cones \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}\omega^n/\mathfrak{m}\omega^n and \bigoplus_{n\geq0}(\omega^{(-1)})^n/\mathfrak{m}(\omega^{(-1)})^n of \omega and \omega^{(-1)} are sum of the Ehrhart rings, defined by sequences of elements of P with a certain condition, which are polytopal complex version of Stanley-Reisner rings. Moreover, we show that the analytic spread of \omega and \omega^{(-1)} are maximum of the dimensions of these Ehrhart rings. Using these facts, we show that the question of Page about Frobenius complexity is affirmative: \lim_{p\to\infty}\mathrm{cx}_F({\cal R}_{\mathbb{K}}[H])= \dim(\bigoplus_{n\geq0}\omega^{(-n)}/\mathfrak{m}\omega^{(-n)})-1, where p is the characteristic of the field \mathbb{K}.
