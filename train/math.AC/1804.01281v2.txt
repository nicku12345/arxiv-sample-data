We study the shape of the F-signature function of a d-dimensional quotient singularity \mathbb{k}[[ x_1,\ldots,x_d]]^G, and we show that it is a quasi-polynomial. We prove that the second coefficient is always zero and we describe the other coefficients in terms of invariants of the finite acting group G\subseteq \mathrm{Gl}(d,\Bbbk). When G is cyclic, we obtain more specific formulas for the coefficients of the quasi-polynomial, which allow us to compute the general form of the function in several examples.
