Consider the rational map \phi: \mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{\mathbf k} \stackrel{[f_0:\cdots: f_n]}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{P}^{n}_{\mathbf k} defined by homogeneous polynomials f_0,\dots,f_n of the same degree d in a polynomial ring R=\mathbf k [x_1,\dots,x_n] over a field \mathbf k. Suppose I=(f_0,\dots,f_n) is a height two perfect ideal satisfying \mu(I_p)\leq\dim R_p for p\in \operatorname{Spec} (R) \setminus V(x_1,\dots, x_n). We study the equations defining the graph of \phi whose coordinate ring is the Rees algebra R[It]. We provide new methods to construct these equations using work of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud. Furthermore, for certain classes of ideals satisfying the conditions above, our methods lead to explicit equations defining Rees algebras of the ideals in these classes. These classes of examples are interesting, in that, there are no known methods to compute the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of such ideals. These new methods also give rise to effective criteria to check that \phi is birational onto its image.
