Let R be a standard graded algebra over an infinite field \mathbb{K} and M a finitely generated \ZZ-graded R-module. Let I_1,\ldots I_m be graded ideals of R. The functions r(M/I_1^{a_1}\ldots I_m^{a_m}M) and r(I_1^{a_1}\ldots I_m^{a_m}M) are investigated and their asymptotical behaviours are given. Here r(\bullet) stands for the reduction number of a finitely graded module \bullet.
