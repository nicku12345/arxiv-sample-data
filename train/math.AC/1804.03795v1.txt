In this paper, we give a formula for normal reduction number of an integrally closed \mathfrak m-primary ideal of a 2-dimensional normal local ring (A,\mathfrak m) in terms of the geometric genus p_g(A) of A. Also we compute the normal reduction number of the maximal ideal of Brieskorn hypersurfaces. As an application, we give a short proof of a classification of Brieskorn hypersurfaces having elliptic singularities.
