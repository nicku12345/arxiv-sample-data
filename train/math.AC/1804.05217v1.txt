In this paper we study generalized Gorenstein Arf rings; a class of one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local Arf rings that is strictly contained in the class of Gorenstein rings. We obtain new characterizations and examples of Arf rings, and give applications of our argument to numerical semigroup rings and certain idealizations. In particular, we generalize a beautiful result of Barucci and Fr\"oberg concerning Arf numerical semigroup rings.
