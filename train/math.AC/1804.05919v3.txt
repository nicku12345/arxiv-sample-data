Given a square-free monomial ideal I in a polynomial ring R over a field \mathbb{K}, one can associate it with its LCM-lattice and its hypergraph. In this short note, we establish the connection between the LCM-lattice and the hypergraph, and in doing so we provide a sufficient condition for removing higher dimension edges of the hypergraph without impacting the projective dimension of the square-free monomial ideal. We also offer algorithms to compute the projective dimension of a class of square-free monomial ideals built using the new result and previous results of Lin-Mantero.
