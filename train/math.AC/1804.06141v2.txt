Let S\neq\mathbb N be a numerical semigroup generated by e elements. In his paper (A Circle-Of-Lights Algorithm for the "Money-Changing Problem", Amer. Math. Monthly 85 (1978), 562--565), H.~S.~Wilf raised the following question: Let \Omega be the number of positive integers not contained in S and c-1 the largest such element. Is it true that the fraction \frac\Omega c of omitted numbers is at most 1-\frac1e?   Let B\subseteq\mathbb N^{e-1} be the complement of an artinian \mathbb N^{e-1}-ideal. Following a concept of A.~Zhai (An asymptotic result concerning a question of Wilf, arXiv:1111.2779v1 [math.CO]) we relate Wilf's problem to a more general question about the weight distribution on B with respect to a positive weight vector. An affirmative answer is given in special cases, similar to those considered by R.~Fr\"oberg, C.~Gottlieb, R.~H\"aggkvist (On numerical semigroups, Semigroup Forum, Vol.~35, Issue 1, 1986/1987, 63--83) for Wilf's question.
