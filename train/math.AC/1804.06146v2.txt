Let S be a numerical semigroup of embedding dimension e and conductor c. The question of Wilf is, if \#(\mathbb N\setminus S)/c\leq e-1/e.   \noindent In (An asymptotic result concerning a question of Wilf, arXiv:1111.2779v1 [math.CO], 2011, Lemma 3), Zhai has shown an analogous inequality for the distribution of weights x\cdot\gamma, x\in\mathbb N^d, w.\,r. to a positive weight vector \gamma:   \noindent Let B\subseteq\mathbb N^d be finite and the complement of an \mathbb N^d-ideal. Denote by \operatorname{mean}(B\cdot\gamma) the average weight of B. Then \[\operatorname{mean}(B\cdot\gamma)/\max(B\cdot\gamma)\leq d/d+1.\]   \bullet For the family \Delta_n:=\{x\in\mathbb N^d|x\cdot\gamma<n+1\} of such sets we are able to show, that \operatorname{mean}(\Delta_n\cdot\gamma)/\max(\Delta_n\cdot\gamma) converges to d/d+1, as n goes to infinity.   \bullet Applying Zhai's Lemma 3 to the Hilbert function of a positively graded Artinian algebra yields a new class of numerical semigroups satisfying Wilf's inequality.
