Let R be a commutative ring and M a non-zero R-module. We introduce the class of \emph{pseudo strongly hollow submodules} (\emph{PS-hollow submodules}, for short) of M. Inspired by the theory of modules with \emph{secondary representations}, we investigate modules which can be written as \emph{finite} sums of PS-hollow submodules. In particular, we provide existence and uniqueness theorems for the existence of \emph{minimal} PS-hollow strongly representations of modules over Artinian rings.
