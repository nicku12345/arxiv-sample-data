Let H=\langle n_1, \ldots ,n_4\rangle be a numerical semigroup generated by 4 elements, which is symmetric and let k[H] be the semigroup ring of H over a field k. H. Bresinski proved that the defining ideal of k[H] is minimally generated by 3 or 5 elements. We give a new short proof of Bresinski's Theorem using the structure theorem of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud on the minimal free resolution of Gorenstein rings of embedding codimension 3.
