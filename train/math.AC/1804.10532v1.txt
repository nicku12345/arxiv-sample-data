In this paper we introduce a family of monomial ideals with the persistence property. Given positive integers n and t, we consider the monomial ideal I=Ind_t(P_n) generated by all monomials \textbf{x} ^F, where F is an independent set of vertices of the path graph P_n of size t, which is indeed the facet ideal of the t-th skeleton of the independence complex of P_n. We describe the set of associated primes of all powers of I explicitly. It turns out that any such ideal I has the persistence property. Moreover the index of stability of I and the stable set of associated prime ideals of I are determined.
