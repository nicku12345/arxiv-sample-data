In 2007 Huneke and Wiegand announced in an erratum that one of the conclusions of their depth formula theorem is flawed due to an incorrect convention for the depth of the zero module. Since then, the deleted claim has remained unresolved. In this paper we give examples to prove that the deleted claim is false, in general. Moreover, we point out several places in the literature which relied upon this deleted claim or the initial argument from 2007.
