The associated Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicities of a module are a descending sequence of non-negative integers. These invariants of a module are a generalization of the classical Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of an ideal. In this article, we compute the associated Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity of a direct sum of cyclic modules and give a formula for the second to last positive Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity in terms of the ordinary Buchsbaum-Rim and Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities. This is a natural generalization of a formula given by Kirby and Rees.
