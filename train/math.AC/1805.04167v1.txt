Let \mathcal{D} be a weighted oriented graph and let I(\mathcal{D}) be its edge ideal. Under a natural condition that the underlying (undirected) graph of \mathcal{D} contains a perfect matching consisting of leaves, we provide several equivalent conditions for the Cohen-Macaulayness of I(\mathcal{D}). We also completely characterize the Cohen-Macaulayness of I(\mathcal{D}) when the underlying graph of \mathcal{D} is a bipartite graph. When I(\mathcal{D}) fails to be Cohen-Macaulay, we give an instance where I(\mathcal{D}) is shown to be sequentially Cohen-Macaulay.
