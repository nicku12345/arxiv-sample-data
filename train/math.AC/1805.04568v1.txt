Huneke and Wiegand conjectured that, if M is a finitely generated, non-free, torsion-free module with rank over a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring R, then the tensor product of M with its algebraic dual has torsion. This conjecture, if R is Gorenstein, is a special case of a celebrated conjecture of Auslander and Reiten on the vanishing of self extensions that stems from the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras.   If R is a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay ring such that R=S/(f) for some local ring (S, \mathfrak{n}), and a non zero-divisor f \in \mathfrak{n}^2 on S, we make use of Hochster's theta invariant and prove that such R-modules M which have finite projective dimension over S satisfy the proposed torsion condition of the conjecture. Along the way we give several applications of our argument pertaining to torsion properties of tensor products of modules.
