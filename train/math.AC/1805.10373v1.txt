We characterize the submonoids M of the additive monoid \Q_+ of nonnegative rational numbers for which the irreducible and the prime elements in the monoid domain F[X;M] coincide. We present a diagram of implications between some types of submonoids of \Q_+, with a precise position of the monoids M with this property.
