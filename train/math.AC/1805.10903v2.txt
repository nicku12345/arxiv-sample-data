We study star operations on Kunz domains, a class of analytically irreducible, residually rational domains associated to pseudo-symmetric numerical semigroups, and we use them to refute a conjecture of Houston, Mimouni and Park. We also find an estimate for the number of star operations in a particular case, and a precise counting in a sub-case.
