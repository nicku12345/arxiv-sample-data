Let G be a finite simple graph on n vertices and J_G denote the corresponding binomial edge ideal in S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_n]. In this article, we prove that if G is a fan graph of a complete graph, then reg(S/J_G) \leq c(G), where c(G) denote the number of maximal cliques in G. Further, we show that if G is a k-pure fan graph, then reg(S/J_G) = k+1. We then compute a precise expression for the regularity of Cohen-Macaulay bipartite graphs.
