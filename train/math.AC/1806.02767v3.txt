Free extensions of commutative Artinian algebras were introduced by T. Harima and J. Watanabe. The Jordan type of a multiplication map m by a nilpotent element of an Artinian algebra is the partition determining the sizes of the blocks in a Jordan matrix for m. We show that a free extension of the Artinian algebra A with fibre B is a deformation of the usual tensor product. This has consequences for the generic Jordan types of A,B and C, showing that the Jordan type of C is at least that of the usual tensor product in the dominance order. We give applications to algebras of relative coinvariants of linear group actions on a polynomial ring.
