Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring.   Using the new concept of linkage of ideals over a module, we show that if \mathfrak{a} is an ideal of R which is linked by the ideal I, then cd(\mathfrak{a},R) \in \{ grad \mathfrak{a}, cd(\fa, H^{grad \mathfrak{a}}_ {\mathfrak{c}} (R)) + grad \mathfrak{a}\},  where \mathfrak{c} : = \bigcap_{\mathfrak{p} \in Ass \frac{R}{I}- V(\mathfrak{a})}\mathfrak{p}. Also, it is shown that for every ideal \mathfrak{b} which is geometrically linked with \mathfrak{a}, cd(\mathfrak{a}, H^{grad \mathfrak{b}}_ {\mathfrak{b}} (R)) does not depend on \mathfrak{b}
