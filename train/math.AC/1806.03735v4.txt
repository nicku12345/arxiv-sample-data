In commutative ring theory, there is a theorem of Cohen which states that if in a commutative ring all prime ideals are finitely generated then every ideal is finitely generated. However, it is known that having only maximal ideals finitely generated doesn't imply all ideals be finitely generated. In his article we ask the question that what happens if we assume all non-maximal ideals are finitely generated, and we answer the question by showing that indeed then all maximal ideals are also finitely generated i.e. the ring becomes Noetherian.
