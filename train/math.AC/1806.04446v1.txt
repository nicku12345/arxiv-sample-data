In this paper we propose a model for computing a minimal free resolution for ideals of the form I_{1}(X_{n}Y_{n}), where X_{n} is an n\times n skew-symmetric matrix with indeterminate entries x_{ij} and Y_{n} is a generic column matrix with indeterminate entries y_{j}. We verify that the model works for n=3 and n=4 and pose some statements as conjectures. Answering the conjectures in affirmative would enable us to compute a minimal free resolution for general n.
