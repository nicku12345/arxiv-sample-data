The Frobenius depth denoted by F-depth defined by Hartshorne-Speiser in 1977 and later by Lyubeznik in 2006, in a different way, for rings of positive characteristic. The first aim of the present paper is to compare the F-depth with formal grade and reprove some results of Lyubeznik using formal local cohomology. Then the endomorphism rings of local cohomology modules will be considered. As an application, we reprove the results due to Huneke-Koh in positive characteristic and Lyubeznik in characteristic zero on the annihilators of local cohomology modules.
