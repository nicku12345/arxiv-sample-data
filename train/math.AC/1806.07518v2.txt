Analogues of Eakin-Sathaye theorem for reductions of ideals are proved for {\mathbb N}^s-graded good filtrations. These analogues yield bounds on joint reduction vectors for a family of ideals and reduction numbers for \mathbb N-graded filtrations. Several examples related to lex-segment ideals, contracted ideals in 2-dimensional regular local rings and the filtration of integral and tight closures of powers of ideals in hypersurface rings are constructed to show effectiveness of these bounds.
