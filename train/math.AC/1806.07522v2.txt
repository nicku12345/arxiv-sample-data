Let (R,\mathfrak m) be an analytically unramified local ring of positive prime characteristic p. For an ideal I, let I^* denote its tight closure. We introduce the tight Hilbert function H^*_I(n)=\ell(R/(I^n)^*) and the corresponding tight Hilbert polynomial P_I^*(n) where I is an \mathfrak m-primary ideal. It is proved that F-rationality can be detected by the vanishing of the first coefficient of P_I^*(n). We find the tight Hilbert polynomial of certain parameter ideals in hypersurface rings and Stanley-Reisner rings of simplicial complexes.
