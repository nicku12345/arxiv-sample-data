Let R be a commutative ring. A quasi-Gorenstein R-module is an R-module such that the grade of the module and the projective dimension of the module are equal and the canonical module of the module is isomorphic to the module itself. After discussing properties of finitely generated quasi-Gorenstein modules, it is shown that this definition allows for a characterization of diagonal matrices of maximal rank over a Noetherian factorial domain R extending a theorem of Frobenius and Stickelberger to modules of projective dimension 1 over a commutative Noetherian factorial domain.
