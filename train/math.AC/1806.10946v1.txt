Let G be a finite group, and V a finite dimensional vector space over a field k of characteristic dividing the order of G. Let H \leq G. The transfer map k[V]^H \rightarrow k[V]^G is an important feature of modular invariant theory. Its image is called a transfer ideal I^G_H of k[V]^G, and this ideal, along with the quotients k[V]^G/I^G_H are widely studied.   In this article we study k[V]^G/I, where I is any sum of transfer ideals. Our main result gives an explicit regular sequence of length \dim(V^G) in k[V]^G/I when G is a p-group. We identify situations where this is sufficient to compute the depth of k[V]^G/I, in particular recovering a result of Totaro. We also study the cases where G is cyclic or isomorphic to the Klein 4 group in greater detail. In particular we use our results to compute the depth of k[V]^G/I^G_{\{1\}} for an arbitrary indecomposable representation of the Klein 4-group.
