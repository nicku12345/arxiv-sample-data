Let H be an atomic monoid. For x \in H, let \mathsf{L}(x) denote the set of all possible lengths of factorizations of x into irreducibles. The system of sets of lengths of H is the set \mathcal{L}(H) = \{\mathsf{L}(x) \mid x \in H\}. On the other hand, the elasticity of x, denoted by \rho(x), is the quotient \sup \mathsf{L}(x)/\inf \mathsf{L}(x) and the elasticity of H is the supremum of the set \{\rho(x) \mid x \in H\}. The system of sets of lengths and the elasticity of H both measure how far is H from being half-factorial, i.e., |\mathsf{L}(x)| = 1 for each x \in H.   Let \mathcal{C} denote the collection comprising all submonoids of finite-rank free commutative monoids, and let \mathcal{C}_d = \{H \in \mathcal{C} \mid \text{rank}(H) = d\}. In this paper, we study the system of sets of lengths and the elasticity of monoids in \mathcal{C}. First, we construct for each d \ge 2 a monoid in \mathcal{C}_d having extremal system of sets of lengths. It has been proved before that the system of sets of lengths does not characterize (up to isomorphism) monoids in \mathcal{C}_1. Here we use our construction to extend this result to \mathcal{C}_d for any d \ge 2. On the other hand, it has been recently conjectured that the elasticity of any monoid in \mathcal{C} is either rational or infinite. We conclude this paper by proving that this is indeed the case for monoids in \mathcal{C}_2 and for any monoid in \mathcal{C} whose corresponding convex cone is polyhedral.
