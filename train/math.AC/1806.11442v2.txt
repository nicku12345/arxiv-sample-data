In this paper, we introduce a new graph whose vertices are the nonzero zero-divisors of commutative ring R and for distincts elements x and y in the set Z(R)^{\star} of the nonzero zero-divisors of R, x and y are adjacent if and only if xy=0 or x+y\in Z(R). we present some properties and examples of this graph and we study his relation with the zero-divisor graph and with a subgraph of total graph of a commutative ring.
