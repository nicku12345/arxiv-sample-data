We continue our study of the new extension of zero-divisor graph. We give a complete characterization for the possible diameters of \widetilde{\Gamma}(R) and \widetilde{\Gamma}(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]), we investigate the relation between the zero-divisor graph, the subgraph of total graph on Z(R)^{\star} and \widetilde{\Gamma}(R) and we present some other properties of \widetilde{\Gamma}(R).
