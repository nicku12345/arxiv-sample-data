Let S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n] denote the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K with each \mathrm{deg}\ x_i = 1 and I \subset S a homogeneous ideal of S with \dim S/I = d. The Hilbert series of S/I is of the form h_{S/I}(\lambda)/(1 - \lambda)^d, where h_{S/I}(\lambda) = h_0 + h_1\lambda + h_2\lambda^2 + \cdots + h_s\lambda^s with h_s \neq 0 is the h-polynomial of S/I. Given arbitrary integers r \geq 1 and s \geq 1, a lexsegment ideal I of S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n], where n \leq \max\{r, s\} + 2, satisfying \mathrm{reg}(S/I) = r and  \mathrm{deg}\ h_{S/I}(\lambda) = s will be constructed.
