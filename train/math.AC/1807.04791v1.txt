Let f: A\rightarrow B and g: A\rightarrow C be two ring homomorphisms and let J (resp., J') be an ideal of B (resp., C) such that f^{-1}(J)=g^{-1}(J'). In this paper, we investigate the transfer of the notions of Gaussian and Pr\"ufer properties to the bi-amalgamation of A with (B,C) along (J,J') with respect to (f,g) (denoted by A\bowtie^{f,g}(J,J')), introduced and studied by Kabbaj, Louartiti and Tamekkante in 2013. Our results recover well known results on amalgamations in \cite{Finno} and generate new original examples of rings satisfying these properties.
