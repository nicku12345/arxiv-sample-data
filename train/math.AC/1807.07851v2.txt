Let \mathfrak{a} be an ideal in a commutative ring R. For an R-module M, we consider the small \mathfrak{a}-torsion \Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}}(M)=\{x\in M\mid\exists n\in\mathbb{N}:\mathfrak{a}^n\subseteq(0:_Rx)\} and the large \mathfrak{a}-torsion \overline{\Gamma}_{\mathfrak{a}}(M)=\{x\in M\mid\mathfrak{a}\subseteq\sqrt{(0:_Rx)}\}. This gives rise to two functors \Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}} and \overline{\Gamma}_{\mathfrak{a}} that coincide if R is noetherian, but not in general. In this article, basic properties of as well as the relation between these two functors are studied, and several examples are presented, showing that some well-known properties of torsion functors over noetherian rings do not generalise to non-noetherian rings.
