We prove that for every nonempty set \Sigma of integers bigger than 1, which has at most three elements, there exists a numerical semigroup T and an element x of T such that a natural number n is the number of atoms in a decomposition of x into atoms if and only if n belongs to \Sigma. We also propose three related conjectures.
