Let R be a commutative ring, Y\subseteq \mathrm{Spec}(R) and  h_Y(S)=\{P\in Y:S\subseteq P \}, for every S\subseteq R. An ideal I is said to be an \mathcal{H}_Y-ideal whenever it follows from h_Y(a)\subseteq h_Y(b) and a\in I that b\in I. A strong \mathcal{H}_Y-ideal is defined in the same way by replacing an arbitrary finite set F instead of the element a. In this paper these two classes of ideals (which are based on the spectrum of the ring R and are a generalization of the well-known concepts semiprime ideal, z-ideal, z^{\circ}-ideal (d-ideal), sz-ideal and sz^{\circ}-ideal (\xi-ideal)) are studied. We show that the most important results about these concepts, "Zariski topology", "annihilator" and etc can be extended in such a way that the corresponding consequences seems to be trivial and useless. This comprehensive look helps to recognize the resemblances and differences of known concepts better.
