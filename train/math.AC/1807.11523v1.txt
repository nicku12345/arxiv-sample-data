Let H be a commutative and cancellative monoid. The elasticity \rho(a) of a non-unit a \in H is the supremum of m/n over all m, n for which there are factorizations of the form a=u_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot u_m=v_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot v_{n}, where all u_i and v_j are irreducibles. The elasticity \rho (H) of H is the supremum over all \rho (a). We establish a characterization, valid for finitely generated monoids, when every rational number q with 1< q < \rho (H) can be realized as the elasticity of some element a \in H. Furthermore, we derive results of a similar flavor for locally finitely generated monoids (they include all Krull domains and orders in Dedekind domains satisfying certain algebraic finiteness conditions) and for weakly Krull domains.
