We identify all semidualizing modules over certain classes of ladder determinantal rings over a field {\mathsf k}. Specifically, given a ladder of variables Y, we show that the ring {\mathsf k}[Y]/I_t(Y) has only trivial semidualizing modules up to isomorphism in the following cases: (1) Y is a one-sided ladder, and (2) Y is a two-sided ladder with t=2 and no coincidental inside corners.
