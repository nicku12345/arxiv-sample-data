Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring and M an R-module with \operatorname{pd_R} M\le 1 that has rank. Necessary and sufficient conditions were provided by Lebelt for an exterior power \wedge^k M to be torsion free. When M is an ideal of R similar necessary and sufficient conditions were provided by Tchernev for a symmetric power S_k M to be torsion free. We extend these results to a broad class of Schur modules L_{\lambda/\mu} M. En route, for any map of finite free R modules \phi\: F\rightarrow G we also study the general structure of the Schur complexes L_{\lambda/\mu}\phi, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the acyclicity of any given L_{\lambda/\mu}\phi by computing explicitly the radicals of the ideals of maximal minors of all its differentials.
