Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a Noetherian local ring, and let M be a finitely generated R-module of dimension d. We prove that the set \left\{\frac{l(M/IM)}{e(I, M)} \right\}_{\sqrt{I}=\mathfrak{m}} is bounded below by {1}/{d!e(\overline{R})} where \overline{R}=R/Ann(M). Moreover, when \widehat{M} is equidimensional, this set is bounded above by a finite constant depending only on M. The lower bound extends a classical inequality of Lech, and the upper bound answers a question of St\"{u}ckrad--Vogel in the affirmative. As an application, we obtain results on uniform behavior of the lengths of Koszul homology modules.
