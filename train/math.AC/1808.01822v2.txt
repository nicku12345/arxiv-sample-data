Let S be a polynomial ring over an algebraic closed field k and  \mathfrak p =(x,y,z,w)  a homogeneous height four prime ideal. We give a finite characterization of the degree two component of ideals primary to \mathfrak p, with multiplicity e \leq 3. We use this result to give a tight bound on the projective dimension of almost complete intersections generated by five quadrics with e \leq 3.
