Let R be a commutative ring and \Gamma a commutative monoid of finite type. We study algebraic properties of modules and derivations over the associated ring \mathcal F(\Gamma,R) of Dirichlet convolutions. If \Gamma is cancellative and G(\Gamma) is its associated Grothendieck group, we construct a natural extension \mathcal F^f(G(\Gamma),R) of \mathcal F(\Gamma,R) and we study its basic properties. Further properties are discussed in the case \Gamma=\mathbb N^* and G(\Gamma)=\mathbb Q^*_+. In particular, we show that \mathcal F^f(\mathbb Q^*_+,R)\cong R[[x_1,x_2,\ldots,]][x_1^{-1},x_2^{-1},\ldots].
