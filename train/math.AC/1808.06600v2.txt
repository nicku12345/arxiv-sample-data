We let R be a one-dimensional graded complete intersection, satisfying certain degree conditions which are satisfied whenever R is a numerical semigroup ring of embedding dimension at least three. We show that a graded maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-module M satisfies the Huneke-Wiegand Conjecture provided there exists an Auslander-Reiten sequence ending in M whose middle term has at least two nonfree direct summands.
