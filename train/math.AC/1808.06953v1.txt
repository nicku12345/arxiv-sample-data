Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a Henselian Cohen-Macaulay local ring and let CM(A) be the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay A-modules. We construct T \colon CM(A)\times CM(A) \rightarrow mod(A), a subfunctor of Ext^1_A(-, -) and use it to study properties of associated graded modules over G(A) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} \mathfrak{m}^n/\mathfrak{m}^{n+1}, the associated graded ring of A. As an application we give several examples of complete Cohen-Macaulay local rings A with G(A) Cohen-Macaulay and having distinct indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules M_n with G(M_n) Cohen-Macaulay and the set \{e(M_n)\} bounded (here e(M) denotes multiplicity of M).
