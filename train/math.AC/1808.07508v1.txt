Let (R, \m) be a d-dimensional commutative noetherian local ring. Let \M denote the morphism category of finitely generated R-modules and let \Sc be the submodule category of \M. In this paper, we specify the Auslander transpose in submodule category \Sc. It will turn out that the Auslander transpose in this category can be described explicitly within {\rm mod}R, the category of finitely generated R-modules. This result is exploited to study the linkage theory as well as the Auslander-Reiten theory in \Sc. Indeed, a characterization of horizontally linked morphisms in terms of module category is given. In addition, motivated by a result of Ringel and Schmidmeier, we show that the Auslander-Reiten translations in the subcategories \HH and \G, consisting of all morphisms which are maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules and Gorenstein projective morphisms, respectively, may be computed within {\rm mod}R via \G-covers. Corresponding result for subcategory of epimorphisms in \HH is also obtained.
