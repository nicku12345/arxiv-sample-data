Let (R,\mathfrak{m}) be a commutative Noetherian local ring which contains a regular sequence  \underline{x} = x_1,\ldots,x_d \in \mathfrak{m} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{m}^2  such that  \mathfrak{m}^3 \subseteq (\underline{x}) . Let  M  be a finite  R -module with maximal complexity or curvature, e.g.,  M  can be a nonzero direct summand of some syzygy module of the residue field  R/\mathfrak{m} . It is shown that the following are equivalent: (1) R is Gorenstein, (2) \mathrm{Ext}_R^{\gg 0}(M,R)=0, and (3) \mathrm{Tor}_{\gg 0}^R(M,\omega) = 0, where \omega denotes a canonical module of R. It gives a partial answer to a question raised by Takahashi. Moreover, the vanishing of \mathrm{Ext}_R^{\gg 0}(\omega,N) for certain  R -module  N  is also analyzed. Finally, it is studied why Gorensteinness of such local rings is important.
