Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be an excellent normal domain of dimension two. We define an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal I to be a p_g-ideal if the Rees algebra A[It] is a Cohen-Macaulay normal domain. When A contains an algebraically closed field k \cong A/\mathfrak{m} then Okuma, Watanabe and Yoshida proved that A has p_g-ideals and furthermore product of two p_g-ideals is a p_g ideal. In this article we show that if A is an excellent normal domain of dimension two containing a field k \cong A/\mathfrak{m} of characteristic zero then also A has p_g-ideals. Furthermore product of two p_g-ideals is p_g.
