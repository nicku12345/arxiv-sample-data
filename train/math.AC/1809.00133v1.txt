For each squarefree monomial ideal I\subset S = k[x_{1},\ldots, x_{n}] , we associate a simple graph G_I by using the first linear syzygies of I. In cases, where G_I is a cycle or a tree, we show the following are equivalent:   (a)  I  has a linear resolution   (b)  I  has linear quotients   (c)  I  is a variable-decomposable ideal   In addition, with the same assumption on G_I, we characterize all monomial ideals with a linear resolution. Using our results, we characterize all Cohen-Macaulay codimension 2 monomial ideals with a linear resolution. As an other application of our results, we also characterize all Cohen-Macaulay simplicail complexes in cases that G_{\Delta}\cong G_{I_{\Delta^{\vee}}} is a cycle or a tree.
