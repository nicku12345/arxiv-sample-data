It is well-known that a C-monoid is completely integrally closed if and only if its reduced class semigroup is a group and if this holds, then the C-monoid is a Krull monoid and the reduced class semigroup coincides with the usual class group of Krull monoids. We prove that a C-monoid is seminormal if and only if its reduced class semigroup is a union of groups. Based on this characterization we establish a criterion (in terms of the class semigroup) when seminormal C-monoids are half-factorial.
