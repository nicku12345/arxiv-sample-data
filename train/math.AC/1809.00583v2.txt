The Poincar\'e series of a ring associated to a plane curve was defined by Campillo, Delgado, and Gusein-Zade. This series, defined through the value semigroup of the curve, encodes the topological information of the curve. In this paper we extend the definition of Poincar\'e series to the class of good semigroup ideals, to which value semigroups of curves belong. Using this definition we generalize a result of Pol: under suitable assumptions, given good semigroup ideals E and K, with K canonical, the Poincar\'e series of K-E is symmetric to the Poincar\'e series of E.
