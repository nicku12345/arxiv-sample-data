In this paper we associate an invariant to a biquaternion algebra B over a field K with a subfield F such that K/F is a quadratic separable extension and \operatorname{char}(F)=2. We show that this invariant is trivial exactly when B \cong B_0 \otimes K for some biquaternion algebra B_0 over F. We also study the behavior of this invariant under certain field extensions and provide several interesting examples.
