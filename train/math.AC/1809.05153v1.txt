We introduce and investigate a new injective version of the complete intersection dimension of Avramov, Gasharov, and Peeva. It is like the complete intersection injective dimension of Sahandi, Sharif, and Yassemi in that it is built using quasi-deformations. Ours is different, however, in that we use a Hom functor in place of a tensor product. We show that (a) this invariant characterizes the complete intersection property for local rings, (b) it fits between the classical injective dimension and the G-injective dimension of Enochs and Jenda, (c) it provides modules with Bass numbers that are bounded by polynomials, and (d) it improves a theorem of Peskine, Szpiro, and Roberts (Bass' conjecture).% for finitely generated modules of finite injective dimension.
