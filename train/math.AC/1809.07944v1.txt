In this article, we construct integrally closed modules of rank two over a two-dimensional regular local ring. The modules are explicitly constructed from a given complete monomial ideal with respect to a regular system of parameters. Then we investigate their indecomposability. As a consequence, we have a large class of indecomposable integrally closed modules whose Fitting ideal is not simple. This gives an answer to Kodiyalam's question.
