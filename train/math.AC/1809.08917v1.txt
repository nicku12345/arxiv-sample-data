Let k be a field of characteristic zero, and R=k[x_1, \ldots, x_d] with d \geq 3 be a polynomial ring in d variables. Let \m=(x_1, \ldots, x_d) be the homogeneous maximal ideal of R. Let \mathcal{K} be the kernel of the canonical map \alpha: \sym(I) \rightarrow \R(I), where \sym(I) (resp. \R(I)) denotes the symmetric algebra (resp. the Rees algebra) of an ideal I in R. We study \mathcal{K} when I is a height two perfect ideal minimally generated by d+1 homogeneous elements of same degree and satisfies G_d, that is, the minimal number of generators of the ideal I_{\mathfrak{p}}, \mu(I_{\mathfrak{p}}) \leq \dim R_{\mathfrak{p}} for every \mathfrak{p} \in V(I) \backslash \{\m\}. We show that \begin{enumerate}[{\rm (i)}]   \item \mathcal{K} can be described as the solution set of a system of differential equations,   \item the whole bigraded structure of \mathcal{K} is characterized by the integral roots of certain b-functions,   \item certain de Rham cohomology groups can give partial information about \mathcal{K}. \end{enumerate}
