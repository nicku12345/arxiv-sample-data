The Frobenius test exponent \operatorname{Fte}(R) of a local ring (R,\mathfrak{m}) of prime characteristic p > 0 is the smallest e_0 \in \mathbb{N} such that for every ideal \mathfrak{q} generated by a (full) system of parameters, the Frobenius closure \mathfrak{q}^F has (\mathfrak{q}^F)^{[p^{e_0}]} = \mathfrak{q}^{[p^{e_0}]}. We establish a suffcient condition for \operatorname{Fte}(R)<\infty and use it to show that if R is such that the Frobenius closure of the zero submodule in the lower local cohomology modules has finite colength, i.e. H^j_{\mathfrak{m}}(R) / 0^F_{H^j_{\mathfrak{m}}(R)} is finite length for 0 \le j < \dim(R), then \operatorname{Fte}(R)<\infty.
