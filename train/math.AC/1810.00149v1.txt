We exhibit a class of Hibi rings which are diagonally F-regular over fields of positive characteristic, and diagonally F-regular type over fields of characteristic zero, in the sense of Carvajal-Rojas and Smolkin. It follows that such Hibi rings satisfy the uniform symbolic topology property effectively in all characteristics. Namely, for rings R in this class of Hibi rings, we have P^{(dn)} \subseteq P^n for all P \in \operatorname{Spec} R, where d = \dim(R). Further, we demonstrate that all Hibi rings over fields of positive characteristic are 2-diagonally F-regular, and that the simplest Hibi ring not contained in the above class is not 3-diagonally F-regular in any characteristic. The former implies that P^{(2d)} \subseteq P^2 for all P \in \operatorname{Spec} R.
