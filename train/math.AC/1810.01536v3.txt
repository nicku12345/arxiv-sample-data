Let R be a polynomial ring over a field. We describe the extremal rays and the facets of the cone of local cohomology tables of finitely generated graded R-modules of dimension at most two. Moreover, we show that any point inside the cone can be written as a finite linear combination, with positive rational coefficients, of points belonging to the extremal rays of the cone. We also provide algorithms to obtain decompositions in terms of extremal points and facets.
