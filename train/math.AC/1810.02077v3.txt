We study the defining equations of the Rees algebra of ideals arising from curve parametrizations in the plane and in rational normal scrolls, inspired by the work of Madsen and Kustin, Polini and Ulrich. The curves are related by work of Bernardi, Gimigliano and Ida, and we use this framework to relate the defining equations.
