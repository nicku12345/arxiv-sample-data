In this paper, we study the family of determinantal ideals of "close" cuts of Hankel matrices, say  \mathcal{f} . We show that the multi-Rees algebra of ideals in  \mathcal{f}  is defined by a quadratic Gr\"{o}bner basis, it is Koszul, normal Cohen-Macaulay domain and it has a nice Sagbi basis. As a consequence of Koszulness, we prove that every product  I_1\ldots I_l  of ideals of  \mathcal{f}  has linear resolution. Moreover, we show that natural generators of every product  I_1\ldots I_l  form a Gr\"{o}bner basis.
