To study the question of whether every two-dimensional Pr\"ufer domain possesses the stacked bases property, we consider the particular case of the Pr\"ufer domains formed by integer-valued polynomials. The description of the spectrum of the rings of integer-valued polynomials on a subset of a rank-one valuation domain enables us to prove that they all possess the stacked bases property. We also consider integer-valued polynomials on rings of integers of number fields and we reduce in this case the study of the stacked bases property to questions concerning 2\times 2-matrices.
