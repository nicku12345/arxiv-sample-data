Let S be a regular local ring with residue field k and let M be a finitely generated S-module. Suppose that f_1,\dots ,f_c\in S is a regular sequence that annihilates M, and let E be an exterior algebra over k generated by c elements.   The homotopies for the f_{i} on a free resolution of M induce a natural structure of graded E-module on {\rm Tor}^{S}(M,k). In the case where M is a high syzygy over the complete intersectionR:=S/(f_{1},\dots,f_{c}) we describe this E-module structure in detail, including its minimal free resolution over E.   Turning to {\rm Ext}_{R}(M,\, k) we show that, when M is a high syzygy over R, the minimal free resolution of {\rm Ext}_{R}(M,\, k) as a module over the ring of CI operators is the Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand dual of the E-module {\rm Tor}^{S}(M,\,k).   For the proof we introduce \emph{higher CI operators}, and give a construction of a (generally non-minimal) resolution of M over S starting from a resolution of M over R and its higher CI operators.
