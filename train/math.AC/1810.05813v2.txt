Let \kk be a field, R a standard graded quadratic \kk-algebra with \dim_{\kk}R_2\le 3, and let \ov\kk denote an algebraic closure of \kk. We construct a graded surjective Golod homomorphism \varphi \colon P\to R\otimes_{\kk}\ov{\kk} such that P is a complete intersection of codimension at most 3. Furthermore, we show that R is absolutely Koszul (that is, every finitely generated R-module has finite linearity defect) if and only if R is Koszul if and only if R is not a trivial fiber extension of a standard graded \kk-algebra with Hilbert series (1+2t-2t^3)(1-t)^{-1}. In particular, we recover earlier results on the Koszul property of Backelin, Conca and D'Al\`i.
