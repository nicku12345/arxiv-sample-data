We consider ideals I in a Stanley-Reisner ring k[\Delta] over the simplical complex \Delta, such that the tight closure of I, I^*, is equal to \mathfrak{m}, the standard graded maximal ideal of k[\Delta]. We determine the minimal number of generators of I to be the \dim \Delta+1 and note the important role this value plays in bounding the intersection of all such ideals I. We make mention of this intersection in special cases of Stanley-Reisner rings. We conclude with a description of how this work relates to integral closure.
