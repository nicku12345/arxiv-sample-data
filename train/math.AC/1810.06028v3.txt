For a reduced Noetherian ring R of characteristic p > 0, in this paper we discuss an extension of R called its perfect closure R^\infty. This extension contains all p^e-th roots of elements of R, and is usually non-Noetherian. We first define the generalized notions of associated primes of a module over a non-Noetherian ring. Then for any R-module M, we state a correspondence between certain generalized prime ideals of (R^\infty \otimes_R M)/N over R^\infty, and the union of associated prime ideals of F^e(M)/N_e as e \in \mathbb{N} varies. Here F refers to the Frobenius functor, and in the paper we define an F-sequence of submodules \lbrace N_e \rbrace \subseteq \lbrace F^e(M) \rbrace as e varies, while \underrightarrow{\lim} \ N_e = N. Under the further assumptions that M is finitely generated and (R,\mathfrak{m}) is an F-pure local ring, we then show that depth_R(F^e(M)) is constant for e \gg 0, and we call this value the stabilizing depth, or s depth_R(M). Lastly, we turn to non-Noetherian measures of the depth of R^\infty \otimes_R M over R^\infty, which generalize as well. Two of these values are the k depth and the c depth, and we show k depth_{R^\infty} (R^\infty \otimes_R M) = s depth_R (M) \geq c depth_{R^\infty} (R^\infty \otimes_R M), while all three values are equal under certain assumptions.
