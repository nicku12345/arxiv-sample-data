The subspace structure of Beidleman near-vector spaces is investigated. We characterise finite dimensional Beidleman near-vector spaces and we classify the R-subgroups of finite dimensional Beidleman near-vector spaces. We provide an algorithm to compute the smallest R-subgroup containing a given set of vectors. Finally, we classify the subspaces of finite dimensional Beidleman near-vector spaces.
