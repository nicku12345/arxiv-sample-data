Let R=K[x_1,...,x_n] be the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K and I be a monomial ideal generated in degree d. Bandari and Herzog conjectured that a monomial ideal I is polymatroidal if and only if all its monomial localizations have a linear resolution. In this paper we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture in the following cases: (i) {\rm height}(I)=n-1; (ii) I contains at least n-3 pure powers of the variables x_1^d,...,x_{n-3}^d; (iii) I is a monomial ideal in at most four variables.
