As a generalization of valuation semirings, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate those semirings that their prime ideals are totally ordered by inclusion. First, we prove that the prime ideals of a semiring S are linearly ordered if and only if for each x,y \in S, there is a positive integer n such that either x|y^n or y|x^n. Then we introduce and characterize pseudo-valuation semidomains. It is shown that prime ideals of pseudo-valuation semidomains and also divided ones are linearly ordered.
