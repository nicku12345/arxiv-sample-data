Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring with non-zero identity, \mathfrak{a} an ideal of R, M a finitely generated R--module, and X an arbitrary R--module. In this paper, for non-negative integers s, t and a finitely generated R--module N, we study the membership of \operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{s}(N, \operatorname{H}^{t}_{\mathfrak{a}}(M, X)) in Serre subcategories of the category of R--modules and present some upper bounds for the injective dimension and the Bass numbers of \operatorname{H}^{t}_{\mathfrak{a}}(M, X). We also give some results on cofiniteness and minimaxness of \operatorname{H}^{t}_{\mathfrak{a}}(M, X) and finiteness of \operatorname{Ass}_R(\operatorname{H}^{t}_{\mathfrak{a}}(M, X).
