In this article, we give two different sufficient conditions for the irreducibility of a polynomial of more than one variable, over the field of complex numbers, that can be written as a sum of two polynomials which depend on mutually disjoint sets of variables. These conditions are derived from analyzing the Newton polytope of such a polynomial and then applying the `Irreducibility criterion' introduced by Gao.
