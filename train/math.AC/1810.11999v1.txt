The aim of this paper is to prove characterization theorems for field homomorphisms. More precisely, the main result investigates the following problem. Let n\in \mathbb{N} be arbitrary, \mathbb{K} a field and f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n}\colon \mathbb{K}\to \mathbb{C} additive functions. Suppose further that equation \[   \sum_{i=1}^{n}f^{q_{i}}_{i}\left(x^{p_{i}}\right)=0   \qquad   \left(x\in \mathbb{K}\right) \] is also satisfied. Then the functions f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n} are linear combinations of field homomorphisms from \mathbb{K} to \mathbb{C}.
