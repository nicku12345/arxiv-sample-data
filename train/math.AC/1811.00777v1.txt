Let R be a Mori domain with complete integral closure \widehat R, nonzero conductor \mathfrak f = (R \ :\ \widehat R), and suppose that both v-class groups \mathcal C_v (R) and \mathcal C_v (\widehat R) are finite. If R/\mathfrak f is finite, then the elasticity of R is either rational or infinite. If R/\mathfrak f is artinian, then unions of sets of lengths of R are almost arithmetical progressions with the same difference and global bound. We derive our results in the setting of v-noetherian monoids.
