We continue our study of ladder determinantal rings over a field \mathsf k from the perspective of semidualizing modules. In particular, given a ladder of variables Y, we show that the associated ladder determinantal ring \mathsf k[Y]/I_2(Y) admits exactly 2^n non-isomorphic semidualizing modules where n is determined from the combinatorics of the ladder Y: the number n is essentially the number of non-Gorenstein factors in a certain decomposition of Y. From this, for each n, we show explicitly how to find ladders Y such that \mathsf k[Y]/I_2(Y) admits exactly 2^n non-isomorphic semidualizing modules. This is in contrast to our previous work, which demonstrates that large classes of ladders have exactly 2 non-isomorphic semidualizing modules.
