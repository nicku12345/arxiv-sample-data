Throughout A will denote commutative noetherian ring, with \dim A=d\geq 2, and P denote a projective A-module with rank(P)=n. In \cite{MM1} we considered the Homotopy obstruction sets \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right), which has a structure of an abelian monoid, under suitable regularity and other conditions. In this article, we provide some perspective on these sets \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right).   Under similar regularity and other conditions, we prove if P, Q are two projective A-modules, with rank(P)=rank(Q)=d and \det(P) \cong \det Q, then \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(Q)\right)\cong \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right). Further, for any projective A-module P with rank(P)=n, we define a natural set theoretic map \pi_0\left({\mathcal LO}(P)\right)\rightarrow CH^n(A), where CH^n(A) Chow groups of codimension n cycles.
