Let (Q,\mathfrak n,k) be a commutative local Noetherian ring, f_1,\dots, f_c a Q-regular sequence in \mathfrak n, and R=Q/(f_1,\dots,f_c). Given a complex of finitely generated free R-modules, we give a construction of a complex of finitely generated free Q-modules having the same homology. A key application is when the original complex is an R-free resolution of a finitely generated R-module. In this case our construction is a sort of converse to a construction of Eisenbud-Shamash yielding a free resolution of an R-module M over R given one over Q.
