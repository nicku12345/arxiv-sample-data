Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and let {\bf x} :=x_1,\ldots,x_d be a regular R-sequence contained in the Jacobson radical of R. An ideal I of R is said to be a monomial ideal with respect to {\bf x} if it is generated by a set of monomials x_1^{e_1}\ldots x_d^{e_d}. It is shown that, if {\bf x}R is a prime ideal of R, then each monomial ideal I has a canonical and unique decomposition as an irredundant finite intersection of primary ideals of the form x^{e_1}_{\tau(1)}R+\dots+x^{e_s}_{\tau(s)}R, where \tau is a permutation of \{1,\ldots,d\}, s\in\{1,\ldots,d\} and {e_1},\ldots,{e_s} are the positive integers. This generalizes and provides a short proof of the main results of \cite{HMRS, HRS}. Also, we show that for every integer k\geq1, I^{(k)}=I^k, if and only if \Ass_R R/{I^k }\subseteq \Ass_R R/{I}, whenever I is a squarefree monomial ideal, where I^{(k)} is the kth symbolic power of I. Moreover, in this circumstance it is shown that all powers of I are integrally closed.
