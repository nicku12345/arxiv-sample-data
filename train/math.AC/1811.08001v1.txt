In this paper, we investigate the algebraic properties of the expectation semirings which are semiring version of the concept of trivial extension in ring theory. We discuss ideals, primes, maximals and primary ideals of these semirings. We also discuss the distinguished elements such as the units, idempotents, and zero-divisors of the expectations semirings. Similar to their counterparts in ring theory, we introduce pr\'{e}simplifiable, domainlike, clean, almost clean, and weakly clean semiring and see when an expectation semiring is one of these semirings.
