Stable cohomology is a generalization of Tate cohomology to associative rings, first defined by Pierre Vogel. For a commutative local ring R with residue field k, stable cohomology modules \widehat{\mathrm{Ext}}{\vphantom E}^{n}_R\;(k,k), defined for n\in\mathbb{Z}, have been studied by Avramov and Veliche. Stable cohomology carries a structure of \mathbb{Z}-graded k-algebra. One of the main goals of this paper is to prove that, for a class of Gorenstein rings, this algebra is a trivial extension of absolute cohomology \mathrm{Ext}_R(k,k) and a shift of \mathrm{Hom}_k(\mathrm{Ext}_R(k,k),k). We use this information to characterize the rings R for which stable cohomology is graded-commutative. Stable cohomology is connected through an exact sequence to bounded cohomology. We use this connection to understand the algebra structure of \widehat{\mathrm{Ext}}_R(k,k) by investigating the structure of bounded cohomology \overline{\mathrm{Ext}}_R(k,k) as a graded \mathrm{Ext}_R(k,k)-bimodule.
