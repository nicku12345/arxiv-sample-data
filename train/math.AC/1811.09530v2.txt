In this paper we describe the method which we applied to successfully compute the primary decomposition of a certain ideal coming from applications in combinatorial algebra and algebraic statistics regarding conditional independence statements with hidden variables. While our method is based on the algorithm for primary decomposition by Gianni, Trager and Zacharias, we were not able to decompose the ideal using the standard form of that algorithm, nor by any other method known to us.
