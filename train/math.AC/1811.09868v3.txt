An integral domain is called {\em Globalized multiplicatively pinched-Dedekind domain (GMPD domain)} if every nonzero non-invertible ideal can be written as JP_1\cdots P_k with J invertible ideal and P_1,...,P_k distinct ideals which are maximal among the nonzero non-invertible ideals, cf. \cite{DumII}. The GMPD domains with only finitely many overrings have been recently studied in \cite{SU}. In this paper we find the exact number of quasi-local overrings of GMPD domains that only finitely many overrings. Also we study the effect of quasi-local overrings on the properties of GMPD domains. Moreover, we consider the structure of the partially ordered set of prime ideals (ordered under inclusion) in a GMPD domain.
