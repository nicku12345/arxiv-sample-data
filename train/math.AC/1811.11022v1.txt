We extend the notion of Frobenius Betti numbers and F-splitting ratio to large classes of finitely generated modules over rings of prime characteristic, which are not assumed to be local. We also prove that the strong F-regularity of a pair (R,\mathscr{D}), where \mathscr{D} is a Cartier algebra, is equivalent to the positivity of the global F-signature {\rm s}(R,\mathscr{D}) of the pair. This extends a result previously proved by these authors, by removing an extra assumption on the Cartier algebra.
