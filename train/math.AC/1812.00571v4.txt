We will define the Alexander duality for strongly stable ideals. More precisely, for a strongly stable ideal I \subset \Bbbk[x_1, \ldots, x_n] with {\rm deg}(\mathsf{m}) \le d for all \mathsf{m} \in G(I), its dual I^* \subset \Bbbk[y_1, \ldots, y_d] is a strongly stable ideal with {\rm deg}(\mathsf{m}) \le n for all \mathsf{m} \in G(I^*). This duality has been constructed by Fl\oystad et al. in a different manner, so we emphasis applications here. For example, we will describe the Hilbert serieses of the local cohomologies H_\mathfrak{m}^i(S/I) using the irreducible decomposition of I (through the Betti numbers of I^*).
