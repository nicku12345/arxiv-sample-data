The Eisenbud-Green-Harris (EGH) conjecture states that a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring K[x_1,\,\ldots,\,x_n] over a field K that contains a regular sequence f_1,\,\ldots,\, f_n with degrees a_i, i=1,\,\ldots,\,n has the same Hilbert function as a lex-plus-powers ideal containing the powers x_i^{a_i}, i=1,\,\ldots,\,n. In this paper, we discuss a case of the EGH conjecture for homogeneous ideals generated by n+2 quadrics containing a regular sequence f_1,\, \ldots, \, f_n and give a complete proof for EGH when n=5 and a_1=\cdots=a_5=2.
