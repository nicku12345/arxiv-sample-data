In this paper we generalize a result, concerning a depth equality over local rings, proved independently by Araya and Yoshino, and Iyengar. Our result exploits complexity, a concept which was initially defined by Alperin for finitely generated modules over group algebras, introduced and studied in local algebra by Avramov, and subsequently further developed by Bergh.
