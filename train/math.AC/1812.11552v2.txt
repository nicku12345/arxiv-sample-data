While every grade 2 perfect ideal in a regular local ring is linked to a complete intersection ideal, it is known not to be the case for ideals of grade 3. We soften the blow by proving that every grade 3 perfect ideal in a regular local ring is linked to a complete intersection or a Golod ideal. Our proof is indebted to a homological classification of Cohen-Macaulay local rings of codimension 3. That debt is swiftly repaid, as we use linkage to reveal some of the finer structures of this classification.
