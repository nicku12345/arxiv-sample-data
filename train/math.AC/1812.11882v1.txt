We discuss various square-free factorizations in monoids in the context of: atomicity, ascending chain condition for principal ideals, decomposition, and a greatest common divisor property. Moreover, we obtain a full characterization of submonoids of factorial monoids in which all square-free elements of a submonoid are square-free in a monoid. We also present factorial properties implying that all atoms of a submonoid are square-free in a monoid.
