We study almost symmetric semigroups generated by odd integers. If the embedding dimension is four, we characterize when a symmetric semigroup that is not complete intersection or a pseudo-symmetric semigroup is generated by odd integers. Moreover, we give a way to construct all the almost symmetric semigroups with embedding dimension four and type three generated by odd elements. In this case we also prove that all the pseudo-Frobenius numbers are multiple of one of them and this gives many consequences on the semigroup and its defining ideal.
