Let (R, \frak m) be a local ring of prime characteristic p of dimension d with the embedding dimension v. Suppose the Frobenius test exponent for parameter ideals Fte(R) of R is finite, and let Q = p^{Fte(R)}. It is shown that e(R) \le Q^{v-d} \binom{v}{d}. We also improve our bound for F-nilpotent rings. Our result extends the main results of Huneke and Watanabe and of Katzman and Zhang.
