Let S be the polynomial ring over a field K and I \subset S a homogeneous ideal. Let h(S/I,\lambda) be the h-polynomial of S/I and s = \mathrm{deg} h(S/I,\lambda) the degree of h(S/I,\lambda). It follows that the inequality s - r \leq d - e, where r = \mathrm{reg} (S/I), d = \dim S/I and e = \mathrm{depth} S/I, is satisfied and, in addition, the equality s - r = d - e holds if and only if S/I has a unique extremal Betti number. We are interested in finding a natural class of finite simple graphs G for which S/I(G), where I(G) is the edge ideal of G, satisfies s - r = d - e. Let a(S/I(G)) denote the a-invariant of S/I, i.e., a(S/I(G)) = s - d. One has a(S/I(G)) \leq 0. In the present paper, by showing the fundamental fact that every Cameron--Walker graph G satisfies a(S/I(G)) = 0, a class of Cameron--Walker graphs G for which S/I(G) satisfies s - r = d - e will be exhibited.
