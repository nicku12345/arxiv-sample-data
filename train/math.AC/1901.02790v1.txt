We show that, given integers n_1,n_2, \ldots ,n_k with 2 < n_1 < n_2 < \cdots < n_k, there exists a local (Noetherian) unique factorization domain that has maximal chains of prime ideals of lengths n_1, n_2, \ldots ,n_k which are disjoint except at their minimal and maximal elements. In addition, we demonstrate that unique factorization domains can have other unusual prime ideal structures.
