In this article we give explicit descriptions of the multiplicities of some classes of monomial ideals. For instance, we give a formula for the multiplicities of all codimension 1 monomial ideals, and another formula for the multiplicities of almost complete intersections. We also introduce a new class of ideals that extends the family of monomial complete intersections, and give a formula for their multiplicity, as well as a visual interpretation of this invariant.
