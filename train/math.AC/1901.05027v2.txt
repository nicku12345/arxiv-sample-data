Let {\sf k} be a field, S be a bigraded {\sf k}-algebra, and S_\Delta denote the diagonal subalgebra of S corresponding to \Delta = \{ (cs,es) \; | \; s \in \mathbb{Z} \}. It is know that the S_\Delta is Koszul for c,e \gg 0. In this article, we find bounds for c,e for S_\Delta to be Koszul, when S is a geometric residual intersection. Furthermore, we also study the Cohen-Macaulay property of these algebras. Finally, as an application, we look at classes of linearly presented perfect ideals of height two in a polynomial ring, show that all their powers have a linear resolution, and study the Koszul, and Cohen-Macaulay property of the diagonal subalgebras of their Rees algebras.
