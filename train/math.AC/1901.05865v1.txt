We use the lcm-lattice of a monomial ideal to study its minimal free resolutions. A new concept called a Taylor basis of a minimal free resolution is introduced and then used throughout the paper. We give a method of constructing minimal free resolutions of a monomial ideal from its lcm-lattice, which is called the atomic lattice resolution theory. Some applications of this theory is given. As the main application, we rewrite the theory of poset resolutions, and we obtain an approximation formula for minimal free resolutions of all monomial ideals.
