Using vanishing of graded components of local cohomology modules of the Rees algebra of the normal filtration of an ideal, we give bounds on the normal reduction number. This helps to get necessary and sufficient conditions in Cohen-Macaulay local rings of dimension d\geq 3, for the vanishing of the normal Hilbert coefficients \overline{e}_k(I) for k\leq d, in terms of the normal reduction number.
