In this paper we prove the following generalization of a result of Hartshorne: Let (S,\n) be a regular local ring of dimension 4. Assume that x,y,u,v is a regular system of parameters for S and a:=xu+yv. Then for each finitely generated S-module N with \Supp N=V(aS) the socle of H^2_{(u,v)S}(N) is infinite dimensional. Also, using this result, for any commutative Noetherian complete local ring (R,\m), we characterize the class of all ideals I of R with the property that, for every finitely generated R-module M, the local cohomology modules H^i_I(M) are I-cofinite for all i\geq 0.
