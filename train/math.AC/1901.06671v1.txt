Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and I be an ideal of R. In this article we answer affirmatively a question raised by the present author in \cite{B2}. Also, as an immediate consequence of this result it is shown that the category of all I-cofinite R-modules \mathscr{C}(R, I)_{cof} is an Abelian subcategory of the category of all R-modules, whenever q(I,R)\leq 1. These assertions answer affirmatively a question raised by R. Hartshorne in [{\it Affine duality and cofiniteness}, Invent. Math. {\bf9}(1970), 145-164], in some special cases.
