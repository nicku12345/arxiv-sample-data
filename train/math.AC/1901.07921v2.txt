Given a 1-tilting cotorsion pair over a commutative ring, we characterise the rings over which the 1-tilting class is an enveloping class. To do so, we consider the faithful finitely generated Gabriel topology \mathcal{G} associated to the 1-tilting class \mathcal{T} over a commutative ring as illustrated by Hrbek. We prove that a 1-tilting class \mathcal{T} is enveloping if and only if  \mathcal{G} is a perfect Gabriel topology (that is, it arises from a perfect localisation) and R/J is a perfect ring for each J \in \mathcal{G}, or equivalently \mathcal{G} is a perfect Gabriel topology and the discrete quotient rings of the topological ring \mathfrak R=End(R_ \mathcal{G}/R) are perfect rings where R_\mathcal{G} denotes the ring of quotients with respect to \mathcal{G}. Moreover, if the above equivalent conditions hold it follows that pdimR_\mathcal{G} \leq 1 and \mathcal{T} arises from a flat ring epimorphism.
