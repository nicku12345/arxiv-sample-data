Given the Hilbert function u of a closed subscheme of a projective space over an infinite field K, let m_u and M_u be, respectively, the minimum and the maximum among all the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularities of schemes with Hilbert function u. I show that, for every integer m such that m_u \leq m \leq M_u, there exists a scheme with Hilbert function u and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity m. As a consequence, the analogous algebraic result for an O-sequence f and homogeneous polynomial ideals over K with Hilbert function f holds too.   Although this result does not need any explicit computation, I also describe how to compute a scheme with the above requested properties. Precisely, I give a method to construct a strongly stable ideal defining such a scheme.
