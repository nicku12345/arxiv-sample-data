We characterize extensions of commutative rings R \subseteq S whose sets of subextensions [R,S] are finite ({\it i.e.} R\subseteq S has the FIP property) and are Boolean lattices, that we call Boolean FIP extensions. Some characterizations involve ``factorial" properties of the poset [R,S]. A non trivial result is that each subextension of a Boolean FIP extension is simple (i.e. R \subseteq S is a simple pair).
