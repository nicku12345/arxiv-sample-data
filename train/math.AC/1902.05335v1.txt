The notion of 2-almost Gorenstein local ring (2-AGL ring for short) is a generalization of the notion of almost Gorenstein local ring from the point of view of Sally modules of canonical ideals. In this paper, for further developments of the theory, we discuss three different topics on 2-AGL rings. The first one is to clarify the structure of minimal presentations of canonical ideals, and the second one is the study of the question of when certain fiber products, so called amalgamated duplications are 2-AGL rings. We also explore Ulrich ideals in 2-AGL rings, mainly two-generated ones.
