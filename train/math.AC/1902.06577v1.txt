For a partition \lambda of n, let I^{\rm Sp}_\lambda be the ideal of R=K[x_1, \ldots, x_n] generated by all Specht polynomials of shape \lambda. We show that if R/I^{\rm Sp}_\lambda is Cohen--Macaulay then \lambda is of the form either (a, 1, \ldots, 1), (a,b), or (a,a,1). We also prove that the converse is true if {\rm char}(K)=0. To show the latter statement, the radicalness of these ideals and a result of Etingof et al. are crucial. We also remark that R/I^{\rm Sp}_{(n-3,3)} is NOT Cohen--Macaulay if and only if {\rm char}(K)=2.
