Let  X  be an  m \times n  matrix of distinct indeterminates over a field  K , where  m \le n . Set the polynomial ring K[X] := K[X_{ij} : 1 \le i \le m, 1 \le j \le n] . Let  1 \le k < l \le n  be such that  l - k + 1 \ge m . Consider the submatrix  Y_{kl}  of consecutive columns of  X  from  k th column to  l th column. Let  J_{kl}  be the ideal generated by `diagonal monomials' of all  m \times m  submatrices of  Y_{kl} , where diagonal monomial of a square matrix means product of its main diagonal entries. We show that  J_{k_1 l_1} J_{k_2 l_2} \cdots J_{k_s l_s}  has a linear free resolution, where  k_1 \le k_2 \le \cdots \le k_s  and  l_1 \le l_2 \le \cdots \le l_s . This result is a variation of a theorem due to Bruns and Conca. Moreover, our proof is self-contained, elementary and combinatorial.
