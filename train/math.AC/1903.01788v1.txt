Let B be an integral domain over a field K of characteristic 0. The derivation \delta of B[Y_d]=B[y_1,\ldots,y_d] is elementary if \delta(B)=0 and \delta(y_i)\in B, i=1,\ldots,d. Then the elements u_{ij}=\delta(y_i)y_j-\delta(y_j)y_i, 1\leq i<j\leq d, belong to the algebra B[Y_d]^{\delta} of constants of \delta and it is a natural question whether the B-algebra B[Y_d]^{\delta} is generated by all u_{ij}. In this paper we consider the special case of B=K[X_d]=K[x_1,\ldots,x_d]. If \delta(y_i)=x_i, i=1,\ldots,d, this is the Nowicki conjecture from 1994 which was confirmed in several papers based on different methods. The case \delta(y_i)=x_i^{n_i}, n_i>0, i=1,\ldots,d, was handled by Khoury in the first proof of the Nowicki conjecture given by him in 2004. As a consequence of the proof of Kuroda in 2009 if \delta(y_i)=f_i(x_i), for any nonconstant polynomials f_i(x_i), i=1,\ldots,d, then B[Y_d]^{\delta}=K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta} is generated by X_d and U_d=\{u_{ij}=f_i(x_i)y_j-y_if_j(x_j)\mid 1\leq i<j\leq d\}. In the present paper we have found a presentation of the algebra \[ K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta}=K[X_d,U_d\mid R=S=0], \] \[ R=\{r(i,j,k,l)\mid 1\leq i<j<k<l\leq d\}, S=\{s(i,j,k)\mid 1\leq i<j<k\leq d\}, \] and a basis of K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta} as a vector space. As a corollary we have shown that the defining relations R\cup S form the reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal which they generate with respect to a specific admissible order. This is an analogue of the result of Makar-Limanov and the author in their proof of the Nowicki conjecture in 2009.
