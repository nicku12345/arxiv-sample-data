We say that a Cohen-Macaulay local ring has finite \operatorname{\mathsf{CM}}_+-representation type if there exist only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are not locally free on the punctured spectrum. In this paper, we consider finite \operatorname{\mathsf{CM}}_+-representation type from various points of view, relating it with several conjectures on finite/countable Cohen-Macaulay representation type. We prove in dimension one that the Gorenstein local rings of finite \operatorname{\mathsf{CM}}_+-representation type are exactly the local hypersurfaces of countable \mathsf{CM}-representation type, that is, the hypersurfaces of type (\mathrm{A}_\infty) and (\mathrm{D}_\infty). We also discuss the closedness and dimension of the singular locus of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of finite \operatorname{\mathsf{CM}}_+-representation type.
