The symbolic powers, in general, are not equal to the ordinary powers. Therefore, one interesting question here is for what classes of ideals ordinary and symbolic powers coincide? The answer to this question for squarefree monomial ideals may be packing property. In this paper, we classify all cubic path ideals for those the symbolic and ordinary powers coincide.
