Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring with residue field k. Using the structure of Vogel cohomology, for any finitely generated module M, we introduce a new dimension, called \zeta-dimension, denoted by \zeta-dim_R M. This dimension is finer than Gorenstein dimension and has nice properties enjoyed by homological dimensions. In particular, it characterizes Gorenstein rings in the sense that: a ring R is Gorenstein if and only if every finitely generated R-module has finite \zeta-dimension. Our definition of \zeta-dimension offer a new homological perspective on the projective dimension, complete intersection dimension of Avramov et al. and G-dimension of Auslander and Bridger.
