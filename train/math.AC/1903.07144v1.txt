Let T be a tilting module. In this paper, Gorenstein \pi[T]-projective modules are introduced and some of their basic properties are studied. Moreover, some characterizations of rings over which all modules are Gorenstein \pi[T]-projective are given. For instance, on the T-cocoherent rings, it is proved that the Gorenstein \pi[T]-projectivity of all R-modules is equivalent to the \pi[T]-projectivity of \sigma[T]-injective as a module.
