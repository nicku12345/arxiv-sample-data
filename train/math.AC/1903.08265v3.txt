Let R be a standard graded Gorenstein algebra over a field presented by quadrics. Conca, Rossi, and Valla have shown that such a ring is Koszul if \mathrm{reg}\, R \leq 2 or if \mathrm{reg}\, = 3 and c= \mathrm{codim}\, R \leq 4, and they ask whether this is true for \mathrm{reg}\, R = 3 in general. We determine sufficient conditions on a non-Koszul quadratic Cohen-Macaulay ring R that guarantee the Nagata idealization \tilde{R} = R \ltimes \omega_R(-a-1) is a non-Koszul quadratic Gorenstein ring. We use this to negatively answer the question of Conca-Rossi-Valla, constructing non-Koszul quadratic Gorenstein rings of regularity 3 for all c \geq 9.
