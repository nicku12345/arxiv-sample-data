In a previous paper, we use idealization to construct numerous examples of standard graded quadratic Gorenstein rings having regularity three which are not Koszul, negatively answering a question of Conca, Rossi, and Valla. This paper is the natural continuation of that work; it aims to completely answer the question for which codimensions c and regularities r is every quadratic Gorenstein ring R with \mathrm{codim}\, R = c and \mathrm{reg}\, R = r Koszul. We prove that quadratic Gorenstein rings with c = r+1 are always Koszul, and for all c \geq r+2 \geq 6, we construct quadratic Gorenstein rings that are not Koszul.
