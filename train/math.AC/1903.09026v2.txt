Let I be a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring over a field. Let I^{(n)} be the n-th symbolic power of I. Motivated by results about ordinary powers of I, we study the asymptotic behavior of the regularity function \text{reg}(I^{(n)}) and the maximal generating degree function d(I^{(n)}), when I is a monomial ideal. It is known that both functions are eventually quasi-linear. We show that, in addition, the sequences (\text{reg}~I^{(n)}/n)_n and (d(I^{(n)})/n)_n converge to the same limit, which can be described combinatorially. We construct an example of an equidimensional, height two squarefree monomial ideal I for which d(I^{(n)}) and \text{reg}(I^{(n)}) are not eventually linear functions. For the last goal, we introduce a new method for establishing the componentwise linearity of ideals. This method allows us to identify a new class of monomial ideals whose symbolic powers are componentwise linear.
