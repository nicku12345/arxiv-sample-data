In this note we show that Harbourne's conjecture is true for symbolic powers of ideals of points, we check that the stable version of this conjecture is valid for ideals of very general points (resp. generic points) in \mathbb P_{\mathbb K}^N (resp. \mathbb P_{\mathbb K(\underline{z})}^N). We also show that this conjecture and the Harbourne-Huneke conjecture are true for a class of ideals I defining fat points obtained from line arrangements in \mathbb P_{\mathbb K}^2.
