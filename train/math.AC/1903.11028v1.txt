In this paper we study those submonoids of \mathbb{N}^d which a non-trivial pseudo-Frobenius set. In the affine case, we prove that they are the affine semigroups whose associated algebra over a field has maximal projective dimension possible. We prove that these semigroups are a natural generalization of numerical semigroups and, consequently, most of their invariants can be generalized. In the last section we introduce a new family of submonoids of \mathbb{N}^d and using its pseudo-Frobenius elements we prove that the elements in the family are direct limits of affine semigroups.
