Let R be a commutative ring with identity. In this note, we study the property: If  I \subsetneqq J are ideals in R, then  I^n \subsetneqq J^n for all  n\geq 1. We define the notion of a big ideal (Definition 1.2). It is noted that the property has close relationship with the notions of reduction of an ideal and Ratliff-Rush ideal [7]. Apart from other results, it is proved that a Noetherian domain satifies the property if and only if every ideal in R is a Ratliff-Rush ideal. We also prove that ideals having no proper reduction are big ideals, and maximal ideals in regular rings are big.
