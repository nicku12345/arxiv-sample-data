Let  A \subset B be rings. An ideal  J \subset B is called power stable in A if  J^n \cap A = (J\cap A)^n for all  n\geq 1. Further, J is called ultimately power stable in A if  J^n \cap A = (J\cap A)^n for all n large i.e.,  n \gg 0. In this note, our focus is to study these concepts for pair of rings  R \subset R[X] where R is an integral domain. Some of the results we prove are: A maximal ideal \textbf{m} in R[X] is power stable in R if and only if  \wp^t  is  \wp-primary for all  t \geq 1 for the prime ideal \wp = \textbf{m}\cap R. We use this to prove that for a Hilbert domain R, any radical ideal in R[X] which is a finite intersection of G-ideals is power stable in R. Further, we prove that if R is a Noetherian integral domain of dimension 1 then any radical ideal in R[X]  is power stable in R, and if every ideal in R[X] is power stable in R then R is a field. We also show that if  A \subset B are Noetherian rings, and  I  is an ideal in B which is ultimately power stable in A, then if  I \cap A = J is a radical ideal generated by a regular A-sequence, it is power stable. Finally, we give a relationship in power stability and ultimate power stability using the concept of reduction of an ideal (Theorem 3.22).
