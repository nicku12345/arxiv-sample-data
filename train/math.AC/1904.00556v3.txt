In this paper we explicitly describe the symbolic powers of curves {\mathcal C}(q,m) in {\mathbb P}^3 parametrized by   ( x^{d+2m}, x^{d+m} y^m, x^{d} y^{2m}, y^{d+2m}), where q,m are positive integers, d=2q+1 and \gcd(d,m)=1. The defining ideal of these curves is a set-theoretic complete intersection. We show that the symbolic blowup algebra is Noetherian and Gorenstein. An explicit formula for the resurgence and the Waldschmidt constant of the prime ideal {\mathfrak p}:={\mathfrak p}_{ { \mathcal C}(q,m) } defining the curve {\mathcal C}(q,m) is computed. We also give a formula for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the symbolic powers {\mathfrak p}^{(n)} for all n \geq 1.
