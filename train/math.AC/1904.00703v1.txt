Given a 0-dimensional scheme X in a n-dimensional projective space P^n_K over an arbitrary field K, we use Liaison theory to characterize the Cayley-Bacharach property of X. Our result extends the result for sets of K-rational points given in [7]. In addition, we examine and bound the Hilbert function and regularity index of the Dedekind different of X when X has the Cayley-Bacharach property.
