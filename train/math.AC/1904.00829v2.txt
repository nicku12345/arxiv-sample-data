Let G be a simple graph on the vertex set [n] and J_G be the corresponding binomial edge ideal. Let G=v*H be the cone of v on H. In this article, we compute all the Betti numbers of J_G in terms of Betti number of J_H and as a consequence, we get the Betti diagram of wheel graph. Also, we study Cohen-Macaulay defect of S/J_G in terms of Cohen-Macaulay defect of S_H/J_H and using this we construct a graph with Cohen-Macaulay defect q for any q\geq 1. We obtain the depth of binomial edge ideal of join of graphs. Also, we prove that for any pair (r,b) of positive integers with 1\leq b< r, there exists a connected graph G such that reg(S/J_G)=r and the number of extremal Betti number of S/J_G is b.
