It is proved that a module M over a Noetherian local ring R of prime characteristic and positive dimension has finite flat dimension if Tor_i^R({}^e R, M)=0 for dim R consecutive positive values of i and infinitely many e. Here {}^e R denotes the ring R viewed as an R-module via the eth iteration of the Frobenius endomorphism. In the case R is Cohen-Macualay, it suffices that the Tor vanishing above holds for a single e\geq \log_p e(R), where e(R) is the multiplicity of the ring. This improves a result of D. Dailey, S. Iyengar, and the second author, as well as generalizing a theorem due to C. Miller from finitely generated modules to arbitrary modules. We also show that if R is a complete intersection ring then the vanishing of Tor_i^R({}^e R, M) for single positive values of i and e is sufficient to imply M has finite flat dimension. This extends a result of L. Avramov and C. Miller.
