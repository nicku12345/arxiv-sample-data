We present, in the same vein as in [20] and [21], some results of the so-called "Smooth (or \mathcal{C}^\infty) Commutative Algebra", a version of Commutative Algebra of \mathcal{C}^{\infty}-rings instead of ordinary commutative unital rings, looking for similar results to those one finds in the latter, and expanding some others presented in [20]. We give an explicit description of an adjunction between the categories \mathcal{C}^\infty{\rm Rng} and {\rm CRing}, in order to study this "bridge". We present and prove many properties of the analog of the radical of an ideal of a ring (namely, the \mathcal{C}^\infty-radical of an ideal), saturation (which we define as "smooth saturation", inspired by [13]), rings of fractions (\mathcal{C}^\infty-rings of fractions, defined first by I. Moerdijk and G. Reyes in [20]), local rings (local \mathcal{C}^\infty-rings), reduced rings (\mathcal{C}^\infty-reduced \mathcal{C}^\infty-rings) and others. We also state and prove new results, such as ad hoc "Separation Theorems", similar to the ones we find in Commutative Algebra, and a stronger version (Theorem 6) of the Theorem 1.4 of [20], characterizing every \mathcal{C}^\infty-ring of fractions. We describe the fundamental concepts of Order Theory for \mathcal{C}^\infty-rings, proving that every \mathcal{C}^\infty-ring is semi-real, and we prove an important result on the strong interplay between the smooth Zariski spectrum and the real smooth spectrum of a \mathcal{C}^\infty-ring.
