We introduce new homological dimensions, namely the Cohen-Macaulay projective, injective and flat dimensions for homologically bounded complexes. Among other things we show that (a) these invariants characterize the Cohen-Macaulay property for local rings, (b) Cohen-Macaulay flat dimension fits between the Gorenstein flat dimension and the large restricted flat dimension, and (c) Cohen-Macaulay injective dimension fits between the Gorenstein injective dimension and the Chouinard invariant.
