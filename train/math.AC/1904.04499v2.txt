Let G be a simple graph on n vertices and J_G denote the binomial edge ideal of G in the polynomial ring S = \mathbb{K}[x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_n]. In this article, we compute the second graded Betti numbers of J_G, and we obtain a minimal presentation of it when G is a tree or a unicyclic graph. We classify all graphs whose binomial edge ideals are almost complete intersection, prove that they are generated by a d-sequence and that the Rees algebra of their binomial edge ideal is Cohen-Macaulay. We also obtain an explicit description of the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of those binomial edge ideals.
