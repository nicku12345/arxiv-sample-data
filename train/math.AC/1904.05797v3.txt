Let {\mathfrak p} be the defining ideal of the monomial curve {\mathcal C}(2q+1, 2q+1+m, 2q+1+2m) in the affine space {\mathbb A}_k^3 parameterized by (x^{2q +1}, x^{2q +1 + m}, x^{2q +1 +2 m}) where gcd( 2q+1,m)=1. In this paper we compute the resurgence of {\mathfrak p}, the Waldschmidt constant of {\mathfrak p} and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the symbolic powers of {\mathfrak p}.
