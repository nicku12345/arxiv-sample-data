The purpose of this paper is, as part of the stratification of Cohen-Macaulay rings, to investigate the question of when the fiber products are almost Gorenstein rings. We show that the fiber product R \times_T S of Cohen-Macaulay local rings R, S of the same dimension d>0 over a regular local ring T with \dim T=d-1 is an almost Gorenstein ring if and only if so are R and S. Besides, the other generalizations of Gorenstein properties are also explored.
