A minimal system of generators of the algebra of the centro-affine covariants for homogeneous planar cubic differential systems with linear part is known. With the help of the Gurevich theorem avoiding the Aronhold's identities based on the calculation of determinants, we describe the algebra of the centro-affne covariants for homogeneous planar cubic differential systems with free terms.
