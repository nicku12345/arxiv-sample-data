We discuss a class of modules, which we call \underline{g}-weak complete intersection modules, inspired by the weak complete intersection ideals studied by Rahmati, Striuli, and Yang and we present explicit formulas for the generators of Koszul homology with coefficients in a \underline{g}-weak complete intersection module. This generalizes work of Herzog and of Corso, Goto, Huneke, Polini, and Ulrich. We use these explicit formulas to study connections between \underline{g}-weak complete intersection ideals and weak complete intersection ideals.
