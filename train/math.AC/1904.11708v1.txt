This note aims at finding explicit and efficient generation of ideals in subalgebras R of the polynomial ring S=k[t] (k a field) such that t^{c_0}S \subseteq R for some integer c_0 > 0. The class of these subalgebras which we call cores of S includes the semigroup rings k[H] of numerical semigroups H, but much larger than the class of numerical semigroup rings. For R=k[H] and M \in \operatorname{Max}R, our result eventually shows that \mu_{R}(M) \in \{1,2,\mu(H)\} where \mu_{R}(M) (resp. \mu(H)) stands for the minimal number of generators of M (resp. H), which covers in the specific case the classical result of O. Forster-R. G. Swan.
