Let P be a commutative Noetherian ring and F be a self-dual acyclic complex of finitely generated free P-modules. Assume that F has length four and F_0 has rank one. We prove that F can be given the structure of a Differential Graded Algebra with Divided Powers; furthermore, the multiplication on F exhibits Poincar\'e duality. This result is already known if P is a local Gorenstein ring and F is a minimal resolution. The purpose of the present paper is to remove the unnecessary hypotheses that P is local, P is Gorenstein, and F is minimal.
