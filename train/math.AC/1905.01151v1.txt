We express the multigraded Betti numbers of monomial ideals in 4 variables in terms of the multigraded Betti numbers of 66 squarefree monomial ideals, also in 4 variables. We use this class of 66 ideals to prove that monomial resolutions in 4 variables are independent of the base field. In addition, we give a formula for the Betti numbers of an arbitrary monomial ideal in 4 variables.
