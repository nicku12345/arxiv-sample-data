Motivated by a recent result of Yoshino, and the work of Bergh on reducible complexity, we introduce reducing versions of invariants of finitely generated modules over commutative Noetherian local rings. Our main result considers modules which have finite reducing Gorenstein dimension, and determines a criterion for such modules to be totally reflexive in terms of the vanishing of Ext. Along the way we give examples and applications, and in particular, prove that a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with canonical module is Gorenstein if and only if the canonical module has finite reducing Gorenstein dimension.
