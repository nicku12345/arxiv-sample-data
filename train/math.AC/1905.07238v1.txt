This article is on the inverse Galois problem in Galois theory of linear iterative differential equations in positive characteristic. We show that it has an affirmative answer for reduced algebraic group schemes over any iterative differential field which is finitely generated over its algebraically closed field of constants. We also introduce the notion of equivalence of iterative derivations on a given field - a condition which implies that the inverse Galois problem over equivalent iterative derivations are equivalent.
