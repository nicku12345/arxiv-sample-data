Let F be a non-negatively graded free module over a polynomial ring \mathbb{K}[x_1,\dots,x_n] generated by m basis elements. Let M be a submodule of F generated by elements in F with degrees bounded by D and dim F/M=r. We prove that if M is graded, the degree of the reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis of M for any term order is bounded by 2\left[1/2((Dm)^{n-r}m+D) \right]^{2^{r-1}}. If M is not graded, the bound is 2\left[1/2((Dm)^{(n-r)^2}m+D) \right]^{2^{r}}. This is a generalization of Dub\'{e}(1990) and Mayr-Ritscher(2013)'s bounds for ideals in a polynomial ring.
