Let R be a commutative ring with identity and M be an R-module. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of 2-irreducible (resp., strongly 2- irreducible) submodules of M as a generalization of irreducible (resp., strongly irreducible) submodules of M and investigated some properties of these classes of modules.
