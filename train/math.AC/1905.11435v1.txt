Let P be a commutative Noetherian ring, K be an ideal of P which is generated by a regular sequence of length four, f be a regular element of P, and Pbar be the hypersurface ring P/(f). Assume that K:f is a grade four Gorenstein ideal of P. We give a resolution N of Pbar/K Pbar by free Pbar-modules.   The resolution N is built from a Differential Graded Algebra resolution of P/(K:f) by free P-modules, together with one homotopy map. In particular, we give an explicit form for the matrix factorization which is the infinite tail of the resolution N.
