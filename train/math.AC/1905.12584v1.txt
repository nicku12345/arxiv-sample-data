Let R be an F-finite Noetherian regular ring containing an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic, and let M be an \F-finite \F-module over R in the sense of Lyubeznik (for example, any local cohomology module of R). We prove that the \mathbb{F}_p-dimension of the space of \F-module morphisms M \rightarrow E(R/\fm) (where \fm is any maximal ideal of R and E(R/\fm) is the R-injective hull of R/\fm) is equal to the k-dimension of the Frobenius stable part of \Hom_R(M,E(R/\fm)). This is a positive-characteristic analogue of a recent result of Hartshorne and Polini for holonomic \D-modules in characteristic zero. We use this result to calculate the \F-module length of certain local cohomology modules associated with projective schemes.
