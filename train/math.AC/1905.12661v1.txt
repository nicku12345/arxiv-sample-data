This note introduces the Macaulay2 package SchurVeronese, which gathers together data about Veronese syzygies and makes it readily accessible in Macaulay2. In addition to standard Betti tables, the package includes information about the Schur decompositions of the various spaces of syzygies. The package also includes a number of functions useful for manipulating and studying this data.
