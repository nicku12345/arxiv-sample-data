A finitely generated module M over a commutative Noetherian ring R is called an I-Cohen Macaulay module, if \[ \grade(I,M) + \dim(M/IM)= \dim(M), \] where I is a proper ideal of R. The aim of this paper is to study the structure of this class of modules. It is discovered that I-Cohen Macaulay modules enjoy many interesting properties which are analogous to those of Cohen Macaulay modules. Also, various characterizations of I-Cohen Macaulay modules are presented here.
