Let k be an infinite field and I\subset k [x_1, \ldots ,x_n] be an ideal such that dim V(I)=q. Denote by (f_1, \ldots, f_s) a set of generators of I. One can see that in the set I\cap k [x_{1},...,x_{q+1}] there exist non-zero polynomials, depending only on these q+1 variables. We aim to bound the minimal degree of the polynomials of this type, and of a B\'ezout (i.e. membership) relation expressing such a polynomial as a combination of the f_i.
