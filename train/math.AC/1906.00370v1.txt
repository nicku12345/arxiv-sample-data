Let R=K[X_1,\ldots, X_n] where K is a field of characteristic zero, and let A_n(K) be the n^{th} Weyl algebra over K. We give standard grading on R and A_n(K). Let I, J be homogeneous ideals of R. Let M = H^i_I(R) and N = H^j_J(R) for some i, j. We show that \Ext_{A_n(K)}^{\nu}(M,N) is concentrated in degree zero for all \nu \geq 0, i.e., \Ext_{A_n(K)}^{\nu}(M,N)_l=0 for l \neq0. This proves a conjecture stated in part I of this paper.
