Given a certain factorization property of a ring R, we can ask if this property extends to the polynomial ring over R or vice versa. For example, it is well known that R is a unique factorization domain if and only if R[X] is a unique factorization domain. If R is not a domain, this is no longer true. In this paper we survey unique factorization in commutative rings with zero divisors, and characterize when a polynomial ring over an arbitrary commutative ring has unique factorization.
