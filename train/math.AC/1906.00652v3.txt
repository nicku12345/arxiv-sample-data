Let S={\sf k}[X_1,\dots, X_n] be a polynomial ring, where {\sf k} is a field. This article deals with the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of squarefree monomial ideal generated in degree n-2. As a consequence, we prove that Betti numbers of powers of the cover ideal of the complement graph of a tree do not depend on the choice of tree. Further, we study the regularity and Betti numbers of powers of cover ideals associated to certain graphs.
