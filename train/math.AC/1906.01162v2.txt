We explore the equimultiplicity theory of the F-invariants Hilbert--Kunz multiplicity, F-signature, Frobenius Betti numbers, and Frobenius Euler characteristic over strongly F-regular rings. Techniques introduced in this article provide a unified approach to the study of these F-invariants under localization and as measurements of singularities.
