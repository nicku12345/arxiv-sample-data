Let S=\langle a_1,\ldots,a_p\rangle be a numerical semigroup, s\in S and {\sf z}(s) its set of factorizations. The set of length is denoted by {\mathcal L}(s)=\{{\tt L}(x_1,\dots,x_p)\mid (x_1,\dots,x_p)\in{\sf Z}(s)\} where {\tt L}(x_1,\dots,x_p)=x_1+\ldots+x_p. From these definitions, the following sets can be defined {\textsf W}(n)=\{s\in S\mid \exists x\in{\sf z}(s) \textrm{ such that } {\tt{L}}(x)=n\}, \nu(n)=\cup_{s\in {\textsf W}(n)} {\mathcal L}(s)=\{l_1<l_2<\ldots< l_r\} and \Delta\nu(n)=\{l_2-l_1,\ldots,l_r-l_{r-1}\}. In this paper, we prove that the set \Delta\nu(S)=\cup_{n\in{\mathbb{N}}}\Delta\nu(n) is almost periodic with period {\rm lcm}(a_1,a_p).
