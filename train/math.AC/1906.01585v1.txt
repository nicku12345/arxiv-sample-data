A proportionally modular affine semigroup is the set of nonnegative integer solutions of a modular Diophantine inequality f_1x_1+\cdots +f_nx_n \mod b \le g_1x_1+\cdots +g_nx_n where g_1,\dots,g_n, f_1,\ldots ,f_n\in \mathbb{Z} and b\in\mathbb{N}. In this work, a geometrical characterization of these semigroups is given. Moreover, some algorithms to check if a semigroup S in \mathbb{N}^n, with \mathbb{N}^n\setminus S a finite set, is a proportionally modular affine semigroup are provided by means of that geometrical approach.
