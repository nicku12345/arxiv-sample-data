The original mixed multiplicity theory considered the class of mixed multiplicities concerning the terms of highest total degree in the Hilbert polynomial. This paper defines a broader class of mixed multiplicities that concern the maximal terms in this polynomial, and gives many results, which are not only general but also more natural than many results in the original mixed multiplicity theory.
