Given \Sigma\subset\mathbb K[x_1,\ldots,x_k], any finite collection of linear forms, some possibly proportional, and any 1\leq a\leq |\Sigma|, it has been conjectured that I_a(\Sigma), the ideal generated by all a-fold products of \Sigma, has linear graded free resolution. In this article we show the validity of this conjecture for two cases: the first one is when a=d+1 and \Sigma is dual to the columns of a generating matrix of a linear code of minimum distance d; and the second one is when k=3 and \Sigma defines a line arrangement in \mathbb P^2 (i.e., there are no proportional linear forms). For the second case we investigate what are the graded betti numbers of I_a(\Sigma).
