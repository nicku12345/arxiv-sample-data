The Auslander-Reiten conjecture is a notorious open problem about the vanishing of Ext modules. In a Cohen-Macaulay local ring R with a parameter ideal Q, the Auslander-Reiten conjecture holds for R if and only if it holds for the residue ring R/Q. In the former part of this paper, we study the Auslander-Reiten conjecture for the ring R/Q^\ell in connection with that for R, and prove the equivalence of them for the case where R is Gorenstein and \ell\le \dim R.   In the latter part, we generalize the result of the minimal multiplicity by J. Sally. Due to these two of our results, we see that the Auslander-Reiten conjecture holds if there exists an Ulrich ideal whose residue ring is a complete intersection. We also explore the Auslander-Reiten conjecture for determinantal rings.
