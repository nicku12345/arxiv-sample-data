Let R be a standard graded commutative algebra over a field k, let K be its Koszul complex viewed as a differential graded k-algebra, and let H be the homology algebra of K. This paper studies the interplay between homological properties of the three algebras R, K, and H. In particular, we introduce two definitions of Koszulness that extend the familiar property originally introduced by Priddy: one which applies to K (and, more generally, to any connected differential graded k-algebra) and the other, called strand-Koszulness, which applies to H. The main theoretical result is a complete description of how these Koszul properties of R, K, and H are related to each other. This result shows that strand-Koszulness of H is stronger than Koszulness of R, and we include examples of classes of algebras which have Koszul homology algebras that are strand-Koszul.
