In this paper we provide some precise formulas for regularity of powers of edge ideal of the disjoint union of some weighted oriented gap-free bipartite graphs. For the projective dimension of such an edge ideal, we give its exact formula. Meanwhile, we also give the upper and lower bounds of projective dimension of higher power of such edge ideals. Some examples show that these formulas are related to direction selection.
