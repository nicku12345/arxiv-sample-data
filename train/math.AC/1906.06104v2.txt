In the derived category of modules over a commutative noetherian ring a complex G is said to generate a complex X if the latter can be obtained from the former by taking summands and finitely many cones. The number of cones required in this process is the generation time of X. In this paper we present some local to global type results for computing this invariant, and discuss applications.
