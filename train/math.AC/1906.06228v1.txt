In this article we establish equivariant isomorphisms of Ext and Tor modules over different relative complete intersections. More precisely, for a commutative ring Q, this paper investigates how Ext_{Q/(\boldsymbol{f})}^*(M,N) and Tor^{Q/(\boldsymbol{f})}_*(M,N) change when one varies \boldsymbol{f} among all Koszul-regular sequences of a fixed length such that \boldsymbol{f} M=0 and \boldsymbol{f} N=0. Of notable interest is how the theory of perturbations is used to establish isomorphisms of certain DG modules.
