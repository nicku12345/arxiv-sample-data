In this paper we present a new efficient variant to compute strong Gr\"obner basis over quotients of principal ideal domains. We show an easy lifting process which allows us to reduce one computation over the quotient R/nR to two computations over R/aR and R/bR where n = ab with coprime a, b. Possibly using available factorization algorithms we may thus recursively reduce some strong Gr\"obner basis computations to Gr\"obner basis computations over fields for prime factors of n, at least for squarefree n. Considering now a computation over R/nR we can run a standard Gr\"obner basis algorithm pretending R/nR to be field. If we discover a non-invertible leading coefficient c, we use this information to try to split n = ab with coprime a, b. If no such c is discovered, the returned Gr\"obner basis is already a strong Gr\"obner basis for the input ideal over R/nR.
