Gr\"obner bases are a fundamental tool when studying ideals in multivariate polynomial rings. More recently there has been a growing interest in transferring techniques from the field case to other coefficient rings, most notably Euclidean domains and principal ideal rings. In this paper we will consider multivariate polynomial rings over Dedekind domain. By generalizing methods from the theory of finitely generated projective modules, we show that it is possible to describe Gr\"obner bases over Dedekind domains in a way similar to the case of principal ideal domains, both from a theoretical and algorithmic point of view.
