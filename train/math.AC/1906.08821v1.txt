A result of Monsky states that the Hilbert-Kunz function of a one-dimensional local ring of prime characteristic has a term \phi that is eventually periodic. For example, in the case of a power series ring in one variable over a prime-characteristic field, \phi is the zero function and is therefore immediately periodic with period 1. In additional examples produced by Kunz and Monsky, \phi is immediately periodic with period 2. We show that, for every positive integer \pi, there exists a ring for which \phi is immediately periodic with period \pi.
