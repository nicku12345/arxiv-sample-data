We prove that if R is a commutative Noetherian ring, then every countably generated flat R-module is quite flat, i.e., a direct summand of a transfinite extension of localizations of R in countable multiplicative subsets. We also show that if the spectrum of R is of cardinality less than \kappa, where \kappa is an uncountable regular cardinal, then every flat R-module is a transfinite extension of flat modules with less than \kappa generators. This provides an alternative proof of the fact that over a commutative Noetherian ring with countable spectrum, all flat modules are quite flat. More generally, we say that a commutative ring is CFQ if every countably presented flat R-module is quite flat. We show that all von Neumann regular rings and all S-almost perfect rings are CFQ. A zero-dimensional local ring is CFQ if and only if it is perfect. A domain is CFQ if and only if all its proper quotient rings are CFQ. A valuation domain is CFQ if and only if it is strongly discrete.
