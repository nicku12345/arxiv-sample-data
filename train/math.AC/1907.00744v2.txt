If \mathbb{F} is an ordered field and M is a finite-rank torsion-free monoid, then one can embed M into a finite-dimensional vector space over \mathbb{F} via the inclusion M \hookrightarrow \text{gp}(M) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{F} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \text{gp}(M), where \text{gp}(M) is the Grothendieck group of M. Let \mathcal{C} be the class consisting of all monoids (up to isomorphism) that can be embedded into a finite-rank free commutative monoid. Here we investigate how the atomic structure and arithmetic properties of a monoid M in \mathcal{C} are connected to the combinatorics and geometry of its conic hull \text{cone}(M) \subseteq \mathbb{F} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \text{gp}(M). First, we show that the submonoids of M determined by the faces of \text{cone}(M) account for all divisor-closed submonoids of M. Then we appeal to the geometry of \text{cone}(M) to characterize whether M is a factorial, half-factorial, and other-half-factorial monoid. Finally, we investigate the cones of finitary, primary, finitely primary, and strongly primary monoids in \mathcal{C}. Along the way, we determine the cones that can be realized by monoids in \mathcal{C} and by finitary monoids in \mathcal{C}.
