The main goal of this paper is to study some properties of an extension of valuations from classical invariants. More specifically, we consider a valued field (K,\nu) and an extension \omega of \nu to a finite extension L of K. Then we study when the valuation ring of \omega is essentially finitely generated over the valuation ring of \nu. We present a necessary condition in terms of classic invariants of the extension by Hagen Knaf and show that in some particular cases, this condition is also sufficient. We also study when the corresponding extension of graded algebras is finitely generated. For this problem we present an equivalent condition (which is weaker than the one for the finite generation of the valuation rings).
