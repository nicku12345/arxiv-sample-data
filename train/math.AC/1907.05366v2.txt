Let G be a finite simple graph and I(G) denote the corresponding edge ideal in a polynomial ring over a field \mathbb{K}. In this paper, we obtain upper bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of symbolic powers of certain classes of edge ideals. We also prove that for several classes of graphs, the regularity of symbolic powers of their edge ideals coincides with that of their ordinary powers.
