We explore the classical Lech's inequality relating the Hilbert--Samuel multiplicity and colength of an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal in a Noetherian local ring (R,\mathfrak{m}). We prove optimal versions of Lech's inequality for sufficiently deep ideals in characteristic p>0, and we conjecture that they hold in all characteristics.   Our main technical result shows that if (R,\mathfrak{m}) has characteristic p>0 and \widehat{R} is reduced, equidimensional, and has an isolated singularity, then for any sufficiently deep \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal I, the colength and Hilbert--Kunz multiplicity of I are sufficiently close to each other. More precisely, for all \varepsilon>0, there exists N\gg0 such that for any I\subseteq R with l(R/I)>N, we have (1-\varepsilon)l(R/I)\leq e_{HK}(I)\leq(1+\varepsilon)l(R/I).
