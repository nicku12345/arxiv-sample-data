Let R be a polynomial or formal power series ring with coefficients in a DVR V of mixed characteristic with a uniformizer \pi. We prove that the R-module annihilator of any nonzero \D(R,V)-module is either zero or is generated by a power of \pi. In contrast to the equicharacteristic case, nonzero annihilators can occur; we give an example of a top local cohomology module of the ring \mathbb{Z}_2[[x_0, \ldots, x_5]] that is annihilated by 2, thereby answering a question of Hochster in the negative.
