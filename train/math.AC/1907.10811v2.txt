Let \Delta be a connected, pure 2-dimensional simplicial complex embedded in \mathbb{R}^2 and let C^{r}(\hat{\Delta}) be the homogenized spline module of \Delta with smoothness r. To study C^{r}(\hat{\Delta}), Schenck and Stillman developed the spline complex S_\bullet/J_\bullet. Schenck and Stiller conjectured that the regularity of H_1(S_\bullet/J_\bullet) is less than 2r+1. In this article, we first consider the case when \Delta has only one totally interior edge, because it is the simplest non-trivial case. Then we may apply the formula we find here to get an upper bound on some more general cases.
