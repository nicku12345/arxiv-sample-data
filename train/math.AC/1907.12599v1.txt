Let R be a ring. In this paper, Gorenstein (n,d)-flat and (n,d)-Gorenstein (n,d)-injective modules and some of their basic properties are studied. Moreover, some characterizations of rings over Gorenstein (n,d)-flat and (n,d)-Gorenstein (n,d)-injective modules are given. Also, some known results can be obtained as corollaries
