Given an arbitrary integer d>0, we construct a homogeneous ideal I of the polynomial ring S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_{3d}] in 3d variables over a filed K for which S/I is a Cohen--Macaulay ring of dimension d with the property that, for each of the integers 0 \leq r \leq d, there exists a monomial order <_r on S with {\rm depth} (S/{\rm in}_{<_r}(I)) = r, where {\rm in}_{<_r}(I) is the initial ideal of I with respect to <_r.
