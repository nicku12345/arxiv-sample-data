Let R be a regular ring, let J be an ideal generated by a regular sequence of codimension at least 2, and let I be an ideal containing J. We give an example of a module H^3_I(J) with infinitely many associated primes, answering a question of Hochster and N\'u\~nez-Betancourt in the negative. In fact, for i\leq 4, we show that under suitable hypotheses on R/J, \text{Ass}\,H^{i}_I(J) is finite if and only if \text{Ass}\,H^{i-1}_I(R/J) is finite. Our proof of this statement involves a novel generalization of an isomorphism of Hellus, which may be of some independent interest. The finiteness comparison between \text{Ass}\, H^i_I(J) and \text{Ass}\, H^{i-1}_I(R/J) tends to improve as our hypotheses on R/J become more restrictive. To illustrate the extreme end of this phenomenon, at least in the prime characteristic p>0 setting, we show that if R/J is regular, then \text{Ass}\, H^i_I(J) is finite for all i\geq 0.
