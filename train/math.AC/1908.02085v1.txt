Let A = K[X_1,\ldots, X_d] and let I, J be monomial ideals in A. Let I_n(J) = (I^n \colon J^\infty) be the n^{th} symbolic power of I \wrt \ J. It is easy to see that the function f^I_J(n) = e_0(I_n(J)/I^n) is of quasi-polynomial type, say of period g and degree c. For n \gg 0 say \[ f^I_J(n) = a_c(n)n^c + a_{c-1}(n)n^{c-1} + \text{lower terms},   \] where for i = 0, \ldots, c, a_i \colon \mathbb{N} \rt \mathbb{Z} are periodic functions of period g and a_c \neq 0.   In an earlier paper we (together with Herzog and Verma) proved that \dim I_n(J)/I^n is constant for n \gg 0 and a_c(-) is a constant. In this paper we prove that if I is generated by some elements of the same degree and height I \geq 2 then a_{c-1}(-) is also a constant.
