In this paper we revisit an example of Celikbas and Takahashi concerning the reflexivity of tensor products of modules. We study Tor-rigidity and the Hochster--Huneke graph with vertices consisting of minimal prime ideals, and determine a condition with which the aforementioned example cannot occur. Our result, in particular, corroborates the Second Rigidity Theorem of Huneke and Wiegand.
