In a recent paper, M. E. Kahoui and M. Ouali have proved that over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero, residual coordinates in k[X][Z_1,\dots,Z_n] are one-stable coordinates. In this paper we extend their result to the case of an algebraically closed field k of arbitrary characteristic. In fact, we show that the result holds when k[X] is replaced by any one-dimensional seminormal domain R which is affine over an algebraically closed field k. For our proof, we extend a result of S. Maubach giving a criterion for a polynomial of the form a(X)W+P(X,Z_1,\dots,Z_n) to be a coordinate in k[X][Z_1,\dots,Z_n,W].   Kahoui and Ouali had also shown that over a Noetherian d-dimensional ring R containing Q any residual coordinate in R[Z_1,\dots,Z_n] is an r-stable coordinate, where r=(2^d-1)n. We will give a sharper bound for r when R is affine over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.
