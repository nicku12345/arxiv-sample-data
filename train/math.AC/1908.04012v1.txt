J. Berson, J. W. Bikker and A. van den Essen proved that for a non-zerodivisor a in a commutative ring R containing Q if the polynomials f_1,\dots,f_{n-1} in R[X_1,\dots,X_n] form a partial coordinate system over the rings R_a and \dfrac{R}{aR} then f_1,\dots,f_{n-1} form a partial coordinate system over the ring R. In this note we show that the theory of residual variables of Bhatwadekar-Dutta and its recent extension by Das-Dutta, extends their result to the case when a is an arbitrary element of A.
