A numerical semigroup S is an additive subsemigroup of the non-negative integers, containing zero, with finite complement. Its multiplicity m is its smallest nonzero element. The Apery set of S is the set \text{Ap}(S) = \{n \in S : n-m \notin S\}. Fixing a numerical semigroup, we ask how many elements of its Apery set have nonunique factorization, and define several new invariants.
