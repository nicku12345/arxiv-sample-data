A Puiseux monoid is an additive submonoid of the nonnegative rational numbers. If M is a Puiseux monoid, then the question of whether each non-invertible element of M can be written as a sum of irreducible elements (that is, M is atomic) is surprisingly difficult. Although various techniques have been developed over the past few years to identify subclasses of Puiseux monoids that are atomic, no general characterization of such monoids is known. Here we survey some of the most relevant aspects related to the atomicity of Puiseux monoids. We provide characterizations of when M is finitely generated, factorial, half-factorial, other-half-factorial, Pr\"ufer, seminormal, root-closed, and completely integrally closed. In addition to the atomicity, characterizations are also not known for when M satisfies the ACCP, the bounded factorization property, or the finite factorization property. In each of these cases, we construct an infinite class of Puiseux monoids satisfying the corresponding property.
