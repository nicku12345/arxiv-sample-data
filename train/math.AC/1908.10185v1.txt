Powers of (monomial) ideals is a subject that still calls attraction in various ways. In this paper we present a nice presentation of high powers of ideals in a certain class in \mathbb K[x_1, \ldots, x_n] and \mathbb K[[x_1, \ldots, x_n]]. As an interesting application it leads to an algorithm for computation of the Ratliff--Rush operation on ideals in that class. The Ratliff--Rush operation itself has several applications, for instance, if I is a regular \mathfrak m-primary ideal in a local ring (R,m), then the Ratliff--Rush associated ideal \tilde I is the unique largest ideal containing I and having the same Hilbert polynomial as I.
