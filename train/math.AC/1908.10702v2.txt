Powers of (monomial) ideals is a subject that still calls attraction in various ways. Let I\subset \mathbb K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] be a monomial ideal and let G(I) denote the (unique) minimal monomial generating set of I. How small can |G(I^i)| be in terms of |G(I)|? We expect that the inequality |G(I^2)|>|G(I)| should hold and that |G(I^i)|, i\ge 2, grows further whenever |G(I)|\ge 2. In this paper we will disprove this expectation and show that for any n and d there is an \mathfrak m-primary monomial ideal I\subset \mathbb K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] such that |G(I)|>|G(I^i)| for all i\le d.
