In this paper we study depth and Stanley depth of the edge ideals and quotient rings of the edge ideals, associated to classes of graphs obtained by taking the strong product of two graphs. We consider the cases when either both graphs are arbitrary paths or one is an arbitrary path and the other is an arbitrary cycle. We give exact formulae for values of depth and Stanley depth for some sub classes. We also give some sharp upper bounds for depth and Stanley depth in the general cases.
