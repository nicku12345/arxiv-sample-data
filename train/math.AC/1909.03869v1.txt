Let (A, \m, k) be a Gorenstein local ring of dimension  d\geq 1. Let I be an ideal of A with \htt(I) \geq d-1.   We prove that the numerical function \[ n \mapsto \ell(\ext_A^i(k, A/I^{n+1}))\] is given by a polynomial of degree d-1  in the case when  i \geq d+1  and \curv(I^n) > 1 for all n \geq 1.   We prove a similar result for the numerical function \[ n \mapsto \ell(\Tor_i^A(k, A/I^{n+1}))\] under the assumption that A is a \CM ~ local ring.   \noindent We note that there are many examples of ideals satisfying the condition \curv(I^n) > 1, for all  n \geq 1.   We also consider more general functions n \mapsto \ell(\Tor_i^A(M,   A/I_n) for a filtration \{I_n \} of ideals in A. We prove similar results in the case when M is a maximal \CM ~ A-module and \{I_n=\overline{I^n} \} is the integral closure filtration, I an \m-primary ideal in A.
