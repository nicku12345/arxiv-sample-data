We define a duality operation connecting closure operations, interior operations, and test ideals, and describe how the duality acts on common constructions such as trace, torsion, tight and integral closures, and divisible submodules. This generalizes the relationship between tight closure and tight interior given in [Epstein-Schwede 2014] and allows us to extend commonly used results on tight closure test ideals to operations such as those above.
