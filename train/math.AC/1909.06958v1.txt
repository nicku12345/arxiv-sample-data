For any ideal I in a Noetherian local ring or any graded ideal I in a standard graded K-algebra over a field K, we introduce the socle module \mathrm{Soc}(I), whose graded components give us the socle of the powers of I. It is observed that \mathrm{Soc}(I) is a finitely generated module over the fiber cone of I. In the case that S is the polynomial ring and all powers of I\subseteq S have linear resolution, we define the module \mathrm{Soc}^*(I) which is a module over the Rees ring of I. For the edge ideal of a graph and for classes of polymatroidal ideals we study the module structure of their socle modules.
