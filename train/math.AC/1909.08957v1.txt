We use the method of characteristic sets with respect to two term orderings to prove the existence and obtain a method of computation of a bivariate Kolchin-type dimension polynomial associated with a non-reflexive difference-differential ideal in the algebra of difference-differential polynomials with several basic derivations and one translation. In particular, we obtain a new proof and a method of computation of the dimension polynomial of a non-reflexive prime difference ideal in the algebra of difference polynomials over an ordinary difference field. As a consequence, it is shown that the reflexive closure of a prime difference polynomial ideal is the inverse image of this ideal under a power of the basic translation. We also discuss applications of our results to the analysis of systems of algebraic difference-differential equations.
