We find sufficient conditions which imply equality of the finitistic test ideal and test ideal in rings of prime characteristic. Utilizing recent progress from the prime characteristic minimal model program we equate the notions of F-regular and strongly F-regular for 4-dimensional rings essentially of finite type over a field of prime characteristic p>5.
