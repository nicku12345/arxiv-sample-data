In this paper we present a method of characteristic sets for inversive difference polynomials and apply it to the analysis of systems of quasi-linear algebraic difference equations. We describe characteristic sets and compute difference dimension polynomials associated with some such systems. Then we apply our results to the comparative analysis of difference schemes for some PDEs from the point of view of their Einstein's strength. In particular, we determine the Einstein's strength of standard finite-difference schemes for the Murray, Burgers and some other reaction-diffusion equations.
