Let R be an affine domain of characteristic zero with finite quotients. We prove that a polynomial map over R is surjective if and only if it is surjective over \hat{R_{\mathfrak{m}}}, the completion of R with respect to \mathfrak{m}, for every maximal ideal \mathfrak{m} \subseteq R. In fact, the completions \hat{R_{\mathfrak{m}}} may be replaced by arbitrary subrings containing R. We use this result to yield a characterization of surjective polynomial maps, and remark that there does not exist a similar principle for injective polynomial maps.
