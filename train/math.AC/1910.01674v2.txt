Let I be an ideal generated by quadrics in a standard graded polynomial ring S over a field. A question of Avramov, Conca, and Iyengar asks whether the Betti numbers of R = S/I over S can be bounded above by binomial coefficients on the minimal number of generators of I if R is Koszul. This question has been answered affirmatively for Koszul algebras defined by three quadrics and Koszul almost complete intersections with any number of generators. We give a strong affirmative answer to the above question in the case of four quadrics by completely determining the Betti tables of height two ideals of four quadrics defining Koszul algebras.
