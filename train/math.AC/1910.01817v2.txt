In this article, we obtain an upper bound for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of powers of an ideal generated by a homogeneous quadratic sequence in a polynomial ring in terms of the regularity of its related ideals and degrees of its generators. As a consequence, we compute upper bounds for the regularity of powers of several binomial ideals. We generalize a result of Matsuda and Murai to show that the regularity of J^s_G is bounded below by 2s+\ell(G)-1 for all s \geq 1, where J_G denotes the binomial edge ideal of a graph G and \ell(G) is the length of a longest induced path in G. We compute the regularity of powers of binomial edge ideals of cycle graphs, star graphs, and balloon graphs explicitly. Also, we give sharp bounds for the regularity of powers of almost complete intersection binomial edge ideals and parity binomial edge ideals.
