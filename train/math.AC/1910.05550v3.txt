Several authors have introduced various type of coherent-like rings and proved analogous results on these rings. It appears that all these relative coherent rings and all the used techniques can be unified. In [2], several coherent-like rings are unified. In this manuscript we continue this work and we introduce coherent-like module which also emphasizes our point of view by unifying the existed relative coherent concepts. Several classical results are generalized and some new results are given.
