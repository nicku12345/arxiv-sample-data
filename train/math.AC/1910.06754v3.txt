Let R be a ring, X a class of R-modules and n>1 an integer. In this paper, via special finitely presented modules, we introduce the concepts of Gorenstein n-X-injective and n-X-flat modules. And aside, we obtain some equivalent properties of these modules on n-X-coherent rings. Then, we investigate the relations among Gorenstein n-X-injective, n-X-flat, injective and flat modules on X-FC-rings (i.e., self n-X-injective and n-X-coherent rings). Several known results are generalized to this new context
