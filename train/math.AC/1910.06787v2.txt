We classify generalized block graphs whose binomial edge ideals admit a unique extremal Betti number. We prove that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of binomial edge ideals of generalized block graphs is bounded below by m(G)+1, where m(G) is the number of minimal cut sets of the graph G and obtain an improved upper bound for the regularity in terms of the number of maximal cliques and pendant vertices of G.
