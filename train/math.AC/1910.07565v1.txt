The main goal of this paper is to prove, in positive characteristic p, stability behavior for the graded Betti numbers in the periodic tails of the minimal resolutions of Frobenius powers of the homogeneous maximal ideals for "most" choices of hypersurface in three variables whose degree is the opposite parity to that of p. We achieve this by developing a method to obtain the degrees of the generators of the defining ideal of a relatively compressed Gorenstein Artinian graded algebra from its socle degree.
