Let R be a commutative ring with identity. An element r \in R is said to be absolutely irreducible in R if for all natural numbers n>1, r^n has essentially only one factorization namely r^n = r \cdots r. If r \in R is irreducible in R but for some n>1, r^n has other factorizations distinct from r^n = r \cdots r, then r is called non-absolutely irreducible. In this paper, we construct non-absolutely irreducible elements in the ring \text{Int}(\mathbb{Z}) = \{f\in \mathbb{Q}[x] \mid f(\mathbb{Z}) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\} of integer-valued polynomials. We also give generalizations of these constructions.
