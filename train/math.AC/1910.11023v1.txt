In this paper, we first consider the relationship between a polynomial ring B over a Noetherian domain R and the ring of invariants A of a {\mathbb G}_a-action on B, when A occurs as a retract of B. Next, we study retracts of a polynomial ring in general and address the questions of D. L. Costa raised in \cite{C}. Finally, we examine the behaviour of ideals and certain properties of rings under retractions.
