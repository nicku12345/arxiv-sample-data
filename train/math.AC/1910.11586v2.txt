Let d\geq3 be an integer, and let \Lambda be a full subsemigroup of \mathbb{N}^t which contains a strictly positive element. We prove that there exists a d-dimensional local unique factorization domain R and a finitely generated torsion-free R-module M such that \Lambda is isomorphic to the semigroup of isomorphism classes of direct summands of direct sums of copies of M. This generalizes a previous result by R. Wiegand who proved it for d=1,2.
