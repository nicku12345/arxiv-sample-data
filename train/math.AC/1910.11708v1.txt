Let R be a lattice ordered ring along with a truncation in the sense of Ball. We give a necessary and sufficient condition on R for its unitization R\oplus\mathbb{Q} to be again a lattice ordered ring. Also, we shall see that R\oplus\mathbb{Q} is a lattice ordered ring for at most one truncation. Particular attention will be paid to the Archimedean case. More precisely, we shall identify the unique truncation on an Archimedean \ell-ring R which makes R\oplus\mathbb{Q} into a lattice ordered ring.
