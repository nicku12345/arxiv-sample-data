Let A\subseteq B be a ring extension and \mathcal{G} be a set of A-submodules of B. We introduce a class of closure operations on \mathcal{G} (which we call \emph{multiplicative operations on (A,B,\mathcal{G})}) that generalizes the classes of star, semistar and semiprime operations. We study how the set \mathrm{Mult}(A,B,\mathcal{G}) of these closure operations vary when A, B or \mathcal{G} vary, and how \mathrm{Mult}(A,B,\mathcal{G}) behave under ring homomorphisms. As an application, we show how to reduce the study of star operations on analytically unramified one-dimensional Noetherian domains to the study of closures on finite extensions of Artinian rings.
