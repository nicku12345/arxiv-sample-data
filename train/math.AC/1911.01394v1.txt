Let T be a complete local (Noetherian) ring and let A be a local subring of T such that the completion of A with respect to its maximal ideal is T. We investigate the possible structures of the partially ordered set Spec(A). Specifically, we explore the minimal prime ideals of A and their formal fibers, the maximal chains of prime ideals in A, and the number of prime ideals in A containing combinations of minimal prime ideals of A.
