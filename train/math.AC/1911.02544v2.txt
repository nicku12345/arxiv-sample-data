In this paper, we study the classes of rings in which every proper (regular) ideal can be factored as an invertible ideal times a nonempty product of proper radical ideals. More precisely, we investigate the stability of these properties under homomorphic image and their transfer to various contexts of constructions such as direct product, trivial ring extension and amalgamated duplication of a ring along an ideal. Our results generate examples that enrich the current literature with new and original families of rings satisfying these properties.
