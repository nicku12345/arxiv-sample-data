The divisor sequence of an irreducible element (\textit{atom}) a of a reduced monoid H is the sequence (s_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}} where, for each positive integer n, s_n denotes the number of distinct irreducible divisors of a^n. In this work we investigate which sequences of positive integers can be realized as divisor sequences of irreducible elements in Krull monoids. In particular, this gives a means for studying non-unique direct-sum decompositions of modules over local Noetherian rings for which the Krull-Remak-Schmidt property fails.
