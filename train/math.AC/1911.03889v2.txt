We prove that the Hilbert-Kunz function of the ideal (I,It) of the Rees algebra \mathcal{R}(I), where I is an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal of a 1-dimensional local ring (R,\mathfrak{m}), is a quasi-polynomial in e, for large e. For s \in \mathbb{N}, we calculate the Hilbert-Samuel function of the R-module I^{[s]} and obtain an explicit description of the generalized Hilbert-Kunz function of the ideal (I,It)\mathcal{R}(I) when I is a parameter ideal in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d \geq 2, proving that the generalized Hilbert-Kunz function is a piecewise polynomial in this case.
