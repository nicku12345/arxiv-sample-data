We show how for a three-dimensional complete local ring in positive characteristic, the existence of an F-invariant, differentiable derivation implies Hochster's small MCM conjecture. As an application we show that any three-dimensional pseudo-graded ring in positive characteristic satisfies Hochster's small MCM conjecture.
