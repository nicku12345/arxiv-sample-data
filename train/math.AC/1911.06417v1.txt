The Frobenius complexity of a local ring R measures asymptotically the abundance of Frobenius operators of order e on the injective hull of the residue field of R. It is known that, for Stanley-Reisner rings, the Frobenius complexity is either -\infty or 0. This invariant is determined by the complexity sequence \{c_ e\}_e  of the ring of Frobenius operators on the injective hull of the residue field. We will show that \{c_ e\}_e  is constant for e\geq 2, generalizing work of Alvarez Montaner, Boix and Zarzuela. Our result settles an open question mentioned by Alvarez Montaner in one of his papers.
