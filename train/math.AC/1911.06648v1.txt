Given a complete local (Noetherian) ring T, we find necessary and sufficient conditions on T such that there exists a local domain A with |A| < |T| and \widehat{A} = T, where \widehat{A} denotes the completion of A with respect to its maximal ideal. We then find necessary and sufficient conditions on T such that there exists a domain A with \widehat{A} = T and |\mbox{Spec}(A)| < |\mbox{Spec}(T)|. Finally, we use "partial completions" to create local rings A with \widehat{A} = T such that \mbox{Spec}(A) has varying cardinality in different varieties.
