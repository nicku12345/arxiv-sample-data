In this article, standard bases of some toric ideals associated to 4-generated pseudo symmetric semigroups with not Cohen-Macaulay tangent cones at the origin are computed. As the tangent cones are not Cohen-Macaulay, non-decreasingness of the Hilbert function of the local ring was not guaranteed. Therefore, using these standard bases, Hilbert functions are explicitly computed as a step towards the characterization of Hilbert function. In addition, when the smallest integer satisfying k(\alpha_2+1)<(k-1)\alpha_1+(k+1)\alpha_{21}+\alpha_3 is 1, it is proved that the Hilbert function of the local ring is non-decreasing.
