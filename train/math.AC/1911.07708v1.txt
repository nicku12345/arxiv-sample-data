We investigate modules for which vanishing of Tor-modules implies finiteness of homological dimensions (e.g., projective dimension and G-dimension). In particular, we answer a question of O. Celikbas and Sather-Wagstaff about ascent properties of such modules over residually algebraic flat local ring homomorphisms. To accomplish this, we consider ascent and descent properties over local ring homomorphisms of finite flat dimension, and for flat extensions of finite dimensional differential graded algebras.
