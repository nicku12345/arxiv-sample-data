In a local Cohen-Macaulay ring (A, \mathrm{m}), we study the Hilbert function of an \mathrm{m}-primary ideal I whose reduction number is two. It is a continuous work of the papers of Huneke, Ooishi, Sally, and Goto-Nishida-Ozeki. With some conditions, we show the inequality \mathrm{e}_1(I)\ge \mathrm{e}_0(I) - \ell_A (A/I) + \mathrm{e}_2(I) of the Hilbert coefficients, which is the converse inequality of Sally and Itoh. We also study relations between the Hilbert coefficients and the depth of the associated graded ring.
