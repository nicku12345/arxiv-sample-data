The purpose of this paper is triple. First off, for an equi-characteristic zero, or a p-torsion free (0, p)-mixed characteristic local ring, we settle, positively, the conjecture on the closedness of the category of modules of finite complete intersection dimension under taking finite direct sums. Secondly, a question proposed by Celikbas, Takahashi and Dao, is answered, again affirmatively, for all (local) rings. This second question asks whether a local ring possessing a (pd-)test module of finite complete intersection dimension has to be a complete intersection? Lastly, in the category of local rings with uncountable residue field, we show that a question raised by Celikbas and Wagstaff has positive answer. This third question asks whether (pd-)test complexes ascend under flat local homomorphisms with regular closed fiber?
