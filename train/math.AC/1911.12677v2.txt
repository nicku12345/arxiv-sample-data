Let G be a connected simple graph on the vertex set [n]. Banerjee-Betancourt proved that \depth(S/J_G)\leq n+1. In this article, we prove that if G is a unicyclic graph, then the depth of S/J_G is bounded below by n. Also, we characterize G with \depth(S/J_G)=n and \depth(S/J_G)=n+1. We then compute one of the distinguished extremal Betti numbers of S/J_G. If G is obtained by attaching whiskers at some vertices of the cycle of length k, then we show that k-1\leq \reg(S/J_G)\leq k+1. Furthermore, we characterize G with \reg(S/J_G)=k-1, \reg(S/J_G)=k and \reg(S/J_G)=k+1. In each of these cases, we classify the uniqueness of extremal Betti number of these graphs.
