We explore the singularity classes F-nilpotent, weakly F-nilpotent, and generalized weakly F-nilpotent under faithfully flat local ring maps. As an application, we show that the loci of primes in a Noetherian ring of prime characteristic which define either weakly F-nilpotent or F-nilpotent local rings are open with respect to the Zariski topology whenever R is F-finite or essentially of finite type over an excellent local ring.
