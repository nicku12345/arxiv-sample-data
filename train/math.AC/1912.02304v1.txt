Let D be an integral domain. Then D is an almost valuation (AV-)domain if for a, b\in D\setminus \{0\} there exists a natural number n with a^{n}\mid b^{n} or b^{n}\mid a^{n}. AV-domains are closely related to valuation domains, for example, D is an AV-domain if and only if the integral closure \bar{D} is a valuation domain and D\subseteq \bar{D} is a root extension. In this note we explore various generalizations of DVRs (which we might call almost DVRs) such as Noetherian AV-domains, AV-domains with \bar{D} a DVR, and quasilocal and local API-domains (i.e., for \{a_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in \Lambda}\subseteq D, there exists an n with (\{a_{\alpha}^{n}\}_{\alpha\in \Lambda}) principal). The structure of complete local AV-domains and API-domains is determined.
