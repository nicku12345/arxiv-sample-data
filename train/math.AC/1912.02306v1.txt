In this paper we introduce two new generalizations of Krull domains: \ast-almost independent rings of Krull type (\ast-almost IRKTs) and \ast-almost generalized Krull domains (\ast-AGKDs), neither of which need be integrally closed. We characterize them using certain types of \ast-homogeneous ideals. To do this we introduce \ast-almost super-homogeneous ideals and \ast-almost super-SH domains. We prove that a domain D is a \ast-almost IRKT if and only if D is a \ast-almost super-SH domain and that a domain is a \ast-AGKD if and only if D is a type 1 \ast-almost super-SH domain. Further, we study \ast-almost factorial general-SH domains (\ast-afg SH domains) and we prove that a domain D is a \ast-afg-SH domain if and only if D is a \ast-IRKT and an AGCD-domain.
