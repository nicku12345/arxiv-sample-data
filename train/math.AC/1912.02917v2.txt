Let R be a standard graded polynomial ring that is finitely generated over a field of characteristic 0, let \mathfrak{m} be the homogeneous maximal ideal of R, and let I be a homogeneous prime ideal of R. Dao and Monta\~{n}o defined an invariant that, in the case that \operatorname{Proj}(R/I) is lci and for cohomological index less than \dim(R/I), measures the asymptotic growth of lengths of local cohomology modules of thickenings. They showed its existence and rationality for certain classes of monomial ideals I.   The following affirms that the invariant exists and is rational for rings R = \mathbb{C}[X] where X is a 2 \times m matrix and I is the ideal generated by size two minors and is to our knowledge, the first non-monomial calculation of this invariant.
