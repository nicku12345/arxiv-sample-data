In Boij-Soderberg theory, it is known that for any degree sequence \mathbf{d}, there exists a finitely generated module that has a pure resolution of type \mathbf{d}. On the other hand, in the case of ideal, there are two necessary conditions for the degree sequence, which \mathbf{d} satisfies them if there is an ideal that has a pure resolution of type \mathbf{d}. In this paper, by theory of generic initial ideals and Boij-Soderberg decompositions, we construct the degree sequence which satisfies these conditions but there is no such an ideal.
