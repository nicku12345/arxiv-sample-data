We study the weak Lefschetz property of a class of graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras of codimension three associated in a natural way to the Ap\'ery set of a numerical semigroup generated by four natural numbers. We show that these algebras have the weak Lefschetz property whenever the initial degree of their defining ideal is small.
