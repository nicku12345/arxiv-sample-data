Let R=k[x,y,z] be a standard graded 3-variable polynomial ring, where k denotes any field. We study grade 3 homogeneous ideals I \subseteq R defining compressed rings with socle k(-s) \oplus k(-2s+1), where s \geq3 is some integer. We prove that all such ideals are obtained by a trimming process introduced by Christensen, Veliche, and Weyman. We also construct a general resolution for all such ideals which is minimal in sufficiently generic cases. Using this resolution, we can give bounds on the minimal number of generators \mu(I) of I depending only on s; moreover, we show these bounds are sharp by constructing ideals attaining the upper and lower bounds for all s\geq 3. Finally, we study the Tor-algebra structure of R/I. It is shown that these rings have Tor algebra class G(r) for s \leq r \leq 2s-1. Furthermore, we produce ideals I for all s \geq 3 and all r with s \leq r \leq 2s-1 such that \textrm{Soc} (R/I ) = k(-s) \oplus k(-2s+1) and R/I has Tor-algebra class G(r), partially answering a question of realizability posed by Avramov.
