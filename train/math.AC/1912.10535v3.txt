An irreducible element of a commutative ring is absolutely irreducible if no power of it has more than one (essentially different) factorization into irreducibles. In the case of the ring \text{Int}(D)=\{f\in K[x]\mid f(D)\subseteq D\}, of integer-valued polynomials on a principal ideal domain D with quotient field K, we give an easy to verify graph-theoretic sufficient condition for an element to be absolutely irreducible and show a partial converse: the condition is necessary and sufficient for polynomials with square-free denominator.
