Inspired by the recent work of Lu and O'Rourke, we study the a_i-invariants of (symbolic) powers of some graded ideals. The first scenario is when I and J are two graded ideals in two distinct polynomial rings R and S over a common field \mathbb{K}. We study the a_i-invariants of the powers of the fiber product via the corresponding knowledge of I and J. The second scenario is when I_{\Delta} is the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a k-dimensional simplicial complex \Delta with k\ge 2. We investigate the a_i-invariants of the symbolic powers of I_{\Delta}.
