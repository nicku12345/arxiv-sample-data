Let a be a proper ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring R with identity. Using the notion of a-relative system of parameters, we introduce a relative variant of the notion of generalized Cohen-Macaulay modules. In particular, we examine relative analogues of quasi-Buchsbaum, Buchsbaum and surjective Buchsbaum modules. We reveal several interactions between these types of modules that extend some of the existing results in the classical theory to the relative one.
