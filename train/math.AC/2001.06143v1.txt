In 2012, Migliore, the first author, and Nagel conjectured that, for all n\geq 4, the artinian ideal I=(L_0^d,\ldots,L_{2n+1}^d) \subset R=k[x_0,\ldots,x_{2n}] generated by the d-th powers of 2n+2 general linear forms fails to have the weak Lefschetz property if and only if d>1. This paper is entirely devoted to prove partially this conjecture. More precisely, we prove that R/I fails to have the weak Lefschetz property, provided 4\leq n\leq 8,\ d\geq 4 or d=2r,\ 1\leq r\leq 8,\ 4\leq n\leq 2r(r+2)-1.
