We relate the analytic spread of a module expressed as the direct sum of two submodules with the analytic spread of its components. We also study a class of submodules whose integral closure can be obtained by means of a simple computer algebra procedure once the integral closure of each row ideal is known. In particular, we analyze a class of modules, not necessarily of maximal rank, whose integral closure is determined by the family of Newton polyhedra of their row ideals.
