The present work is concerned with characterizing some algebraic invariants of edge ideals of hypergraphs. To this aim, firstly, we introduce some kinds of combinatorial invariants similar to matching numbers for hypergraphs. Then we compare them to each other and to previously existing ones. These invariants are used for characterizing or bounding some algebraic invariants of edge ideals of hypergraphs such as graded Betti numbers, projective dimension and Castelnouvo-Mumford regularity.
