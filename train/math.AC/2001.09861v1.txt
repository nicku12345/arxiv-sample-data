Let M be a module over a commutative ring R. The annihilating-submodule graph of M, denoted by AG(M), is a simple graph in which a non-zero submodule N of M is a vertex if and only if there exists a non-zero proper submodule K of M such that NK=(0), where NK, the product of N and K, is denoted by (N:M)(K:M)M and two distinct vertices N and K are adjacent if and only if NK=(0). This graph is a submodule version of the annihilating-ideal graph and under some conditions, is isomorphic with an induced subgraph of the Zariski topology-graph G(\tau_T) which was introduced in (The Zariski topology-graph of modules over commutative rings, Comm. Algebra., 42 (2014), 3283--3296). In this paper, we study the domination number of AG(M) and some connections between the graph-theoretic properties of AG(M) and algebraic properties of module M.
