Let M be a module over a commutative ring R. In this paper, we continue our study about the Zariski topology-graph G(\tau_T) which was introduced in (The Zariski topology-graph of modules over commutative rings, Comm. Algebra., 42 (2014), 3283--3296). For a non-empty subset T of Spec(M), we obtain useful characterizations for those modules M for which G(\tau_T) is a bipartite graph. Also, we prove that if G(\tau_T) is a tree, then G(\tau_T) is a star graph. Moreover, we study coloring of Zariski topology-graphs and investigate the interplay between \chi(G(\tau_T)) and \omega(G(\tau_T)).
