Given a commutative local ring (R,\mathfrak m) and an ideal I of R, a family of quotients of the Rees algebra R[It] has been recently studied as a unified approach to the Nagata's idealization and the amalgamated duplication and as a way to construct interesting examples, especially integral domains. When R is noetherian of prime characteristic, we compute the Hilbert-Kunz function of the members of this family and, provided that either I is \mathfrak{m}-primary or R is regular, we also find their Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity. Some consequences and examples are explored.
