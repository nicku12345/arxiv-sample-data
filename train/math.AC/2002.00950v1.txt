In this article we study two classes of integral domains. The first is characterized by having a finite intersection of principal ideals being finitely generated only when it is principal. The second class consists of the integral domains in which a finite intersection of principal ideals is always non-finitely generated except in the case of containment of one of the principal ideals in all the others. We relate these classes to many well-studied classes of integral domains, to star operations and to classical and new ring constructions.
