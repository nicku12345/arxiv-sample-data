Let k\in \mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\}. For a commutative ring R, the ring of dual numbers of k variables over R is the quotient ring R[x_1,\ldots,x_k]/ I , where I is the ideal generated by the set \{x_ix_j: i,j=1,\ldots,k\}. This ring can be viewed as R[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k] with \alpha_i \alpha_j=0, where \alpha_i=x_i+I for i,j=1,\ldots,k. We investigate the polynomial functions of R[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k] whenever R is a finite local ring. We derive counting formulas for the number of polynomial functions and polynomial permutations on R[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k] depending on the order of the pointwise stabilizer of the subring of constants R in the group of polynomial permutations of R[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k]. Moreover, we show that the stabilizer group of R is independent from the number of variables k.
