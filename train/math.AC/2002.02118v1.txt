In this paper we extend an epimorphism theorem of D. Wright to the case of discrete valuation rings. We will show that if (R, t) is a discrete valuation ring, n \ge 2 is an integer not divisible by the characteristic of the residue field R/tR, and g \in R[X, Y, Z] is a polynomial of the form g = b(X,Y)Z^n - a(X,Y) such that R[X, Y, Z]/(g) is a polynomial algebra in two variables, then g and Z form a pair of variables in R[X, Y, Z]. We will also show that the result holds over any Noetherian domain containing \mathbb{Q}.
