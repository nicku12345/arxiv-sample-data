For a partition \lambda of n \in {\mathbb N}, let I^{\rm Sp}_\lambda be the ideal of R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] generated by all Specht polynomials of shape \lambda. In the previous paper, the second author showed that if R/I^{\rm Sp}_\lambda is Cohen-Macaulay, then \lambda is either (n-d,1,\ldots,1),(n-d,d), or (d,d,1), and the converse is true if {\rm char}(K)=0. In this paper, we compute the Hilbert series of R/I^{\rm Sp}_\lambda for \lambda=(n-d,d) or (d,d,1). Hence, we get the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of R/I^{\rm Sp}_\lambda, when it is Cohen-Macaulay. In particular, I^{\rm Sp}_{(d,d,1)} has a (d+2)-linear resolution in the Cohen-Macaulay case.
