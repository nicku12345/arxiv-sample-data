We study families of cellular resolutions by looking at them as a category and applying tools from representation stability. We obtain sufficient conditions on the structure of the family to have a noetherian representation category and apply this to concrete examples of families. In the study of syzygies we make use of defining the syzygy module as a representation and find conditions for the finite generation of this representation. We then show that many families of cellular resolutions coming from powers of ideals satisfy these conditions and have finitely generated syzygies, including the maximal ideals and edge ideals of paths.
