Let K be the field of Laurent series with complex coefficients, let \mathcal{R} be the inverse limit of the standard-graded polynomial rings K[x_1, \ldots, x_n], and let \mathcal{R}^{\flat} be the subring of \mathcal{R} consisting of elements with bounded denominators. In previous joint work with Erman and Sam, we showed that \mathcal{R} and \mathcal{R}^{\flat} (and many similarly defined rings) are abstractly polynomial rings, and used this to give new proofs of Stillman's conjecture. In this paper, we prove the complementary result that \mathcal{R} is a polynomial algebra over \mathcal{R}^{\flat}.
