In this paper, we study Serre's condition (S_n) for tensor products of modules over a commutative noetherian local ring. The paper aims to show the following. Let M and N be finitely generated module over a commutative noetherian local ring R, either of which is (n+1)-Tor-rigid. If the tensor product M \otimes_R N satisfies (S_{n+1}), then under some assumptions \mathrm{Tor}_{i}^R(M, N) = 0 for all i \ge 1. The key role is played by (n+1)-Tor-rigidity of modules. As applications, we will show that the result recovers several known results.
