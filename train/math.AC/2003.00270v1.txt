We consider the following question: if a simplicial complex \Delta has d-homology, then does the corresponding d-cycle always induce cycles of smaller dimension that are not boundaries in \Delta? We provide an answer to this question in a fixed dimension. We use the breaking of homology to show the subadditivity property for the maximal degrees of syzygies of monomial ideals in a fixed homological degree.
