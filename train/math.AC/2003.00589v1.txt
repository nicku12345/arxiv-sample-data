Let R^h denote the polynomial ring in variables x_1,\,\ldots,\, x_h over a specified field K. We consider all of these rings simultaneously, and in each use lexicographic (lex) monomial order with x_1 > \cdots > x_h. Given a fixed homogeneous ideal I in R^h, for each d there is unique lex ideal generated in degree at most d whose Hilbert function agrees with the Hilbert function of I up to degree d. When we consider IR^N for N \geq h, the set \mathfrak{B}_d(I,N) of minimal generators for this lex ideal in degree at most d may change, but \mathfrak{B}_d(I,N) is constant for all N \gg 0. We let \mathfrak{B}_d(I) denote the set of generators one obtains for all N \gg 0, and we let b_d = b_d(I) be its cardinality. The sequences b_1, \, \ldots, \, b_d, \, \ldots obtained in this way may grow very fast. Remarkably, even when I = (x_1^2, x_2^2), one obtains a very interesting sequence, 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 924, 409620,\,\ldots. This sequence is the same as H_{d-1} + 1 for d \geq 2, where H_d is the d\,th Hamilton number. The Hamilton numbers were studied by Hamilton and by Hammond and Sylvester because of their occurrence in a counting problem connected with the use of Tschirnhaus transformations in manipulating polynomial equations.
