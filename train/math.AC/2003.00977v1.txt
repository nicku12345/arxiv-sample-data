We give an explicit formula for the Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} series of the parity binomial edge ideal of a complete graph K_{n} or equivalently for the ideal generated by all 2\times 2-permanents of a 2\times n-matrix. It follows that the depth and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of these ideals are independent of n.
