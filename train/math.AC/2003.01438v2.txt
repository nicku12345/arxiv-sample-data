Let R be the face ring of a simplicial complex of dimension d-1 and {\mathcal R}(\mathfrak{n}) be the Rees algebra of the maximal homogeneous ideal \mathfrak{n} of R. We show that the generalized Hilbert-Kunz function HK(s)=\ell({\mathcal R}(\mathfrak n)/(\mathfrak n, \mathfrak n t)^{[s]}) is given by a polynomial for all large s. We calculate it in many examples and also provide a Macaulay2 code for computing HK(s).
