Let R be a Noetherian ring. For a finitely generated R-module M, Northcott introduced the reducibility index of M, which is the number of submodules appearing in an irredundant irreducible decomposition of the submodule 0 in M. On the other hand, for an Artinian R-module A, Macdonald proved that the number of sum-irreducible submodules appearing in an irredundant sum-irreducible representation of A does not depend on the choice of the representation. This number is called the sum-reducibility index of A. In the former part of this paper, we compute the reducibility index of S\otimes_R M, where R\to S is a flat homomorphism of Noetherian rings. Especially, the localization, the polynomial extension, and the completion of R are studied. For the latter part of this paper, we clarify the relation among the reducibility index of M, that of the completion of M, and the sum-reducibility index of the Matlis dual of M.
