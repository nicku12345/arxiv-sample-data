Polynomial n\times n matrices A(\lambda) and B(\lambda) over a field \mathbb F  are called semi-scalar equivalent if there exist a nonsingular n\times n matrix P over the field \mathbb F  and an invertible n\times n matrix Q(\lambda) over the ring {\mathbb F}[\lambda] such that A(\lambda)=P B(\lambda)Q(\lambda). The semi-scalar equivalence of matrices over a field  {\mathbb F}  contain the problem of similarity between two families of matrices. Therefore, these equivalences of matrices can be considered a difficult problem in linear algebra.   The aim of the present paper is to present the necessary and sufficient conditions of semi-scalar equivalence of nonsingular matrices A(\lambda) and  B(\lambda)  over a field {\mathbb F } of characteristic zero in terms of solutions of a homogenous system of linear equations. We also establish similarity of monic polynomial matrices A(\lambda) and B(\lambda) over a field.
