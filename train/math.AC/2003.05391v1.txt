We extend some results on almost Gorenstein affine monomial curves to the nearly Gorenstein case. In particular, we prove that the Cohen-Macaulay type of a nearly Gorenstein monomial curve in \mathbb{A}^4 is at most 3, answering a question of Stamate in this particular case. Moreover, we prove that, if \mathcal C is a nearly Gorenstein affine monomial curve which is not Gorenstein and n_1, \dots, n_{\nu} are the minimal generators of the associated numerical semigroup, the elements of \{n_1, \dots, \widehat{n_i}, \dots, n_{\nu}\} are relatively coprime for every i.
