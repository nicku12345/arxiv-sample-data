Let R a commutative ring, \mathfrak{a} \subset R an ideal, I an injective R-module and S \subset R a multiplicatively closed set. When R is Noetherian it is well-known that the \mathfrak{a}-torsion sub-module \Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}}(I), the factor module I/\Gamma_{\mathfrak{a}}(I) and the localization I_S are again injective R-modules. We investigate these properties in the case of a commutative ring R by means of a notion of relatively-\mathfrak{a}-injective R-modules. In particular we get another characterization of weakly pro-regular sequences in terms of relatively injective modules. Also we present examples of non-Noetherian commutative rings R and injective R-modules for which the previous properties do not hold. Moreover, under some weak pro-regularity conditions we obtain results of Mayer-Vietoris type.
