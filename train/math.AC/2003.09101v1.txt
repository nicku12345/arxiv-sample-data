In this survey article we give a brief history of symbolic powers and its connection with the interesting problem of set-theoretic complete intersection. We also state a few problems and conjectures. Recently, in connection to symbolic powers is the containment problem. We list a few interesting results and related problems on the resurgence, Waldschmidt constant and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.
