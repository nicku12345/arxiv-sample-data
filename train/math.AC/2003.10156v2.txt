Let (A,\mathfrak{m}) be a Noetherian local ring of dimension d>0 and I an \mathcal{I}-primary ideal of A. In this paper, we discuss a sufficient condition, for the Buchsbaumness of the local ring A to be passed onto the associated graded ring of filtration. Let \mathcal{I} denote an I-good filtration. We prove that if A is Buchsbaum and the I-invariant, I(A) and I(G(\mathcal{I})), coincide then the associated graded ring G(\mathcal{I}) is Buchsbaum. As an application of our result, we indicate an alternative proof of a conjecture, of Corso on certain boundary conditions for Hilbert coefficients.
