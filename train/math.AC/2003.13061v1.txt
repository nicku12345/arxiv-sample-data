We propose the notion of GAS numerical semigroup which generalizes both almost symmetric and 2-AGL numerical semigroups. Moreover, we introduce the concept of almost canonical ideal which generalizes the notion of canonical ideal in the same way almost symmetric numerical semigroups generalize symmetric ones. We prove that a numerical semigroup with maximal ideal M and multiplicity e is GAS if and only if M-e is an almost canonical ideal of M-M. This generalizes a result of Barucci about almost symmetric semigroups and a theorem of Chau, Goto, Kumashiro, and Matsuoka about 2-AGL semigroups. We also study the transfer of the GAS property from a numerical semigroup to its gluing, numerical duplication and dilatation.
