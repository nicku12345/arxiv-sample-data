Motivated by a work of Knutson, in a recent paper Conca and Varbaro have defined a new class of ideals, namely "Knutson ideals", starting from a polynomial f with squarefree leading term. We will show that the main properties that this class has in polynomial rings over fields of characteristic p are preserved when one introduces the definition of Knutson ideal also in polynomial rings over fields of characteristic zero. Then we will show that determinantal ideals of Hankel matrices are Knutson ideals for a suitable choice of the polynomial f.
