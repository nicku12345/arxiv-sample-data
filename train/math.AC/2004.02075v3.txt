Let R be a regular local ring of dimension d and H^{d-1}_J (R) be the (d-1)-th local cohomology module supported at the ideal J. The second vanishing theorem for the local cohomology or the SVT is well known in regular local rings containing field and for complete unramified regular local ring of mixed characteristic. It states that under certain conditions on J (see below for detail), H^{d-1}_J (R) vanishes if and only if the punctured spectrum R/J is connected. In this paper, we extend the result of SVT partially to complete ramified regular local ring only for the extended ideals. When punctured spectrum is not connected but it has t number of connected components, we show that the Matlis duals of these local cohmology modules are free modules with t-1 generators. They also support the Conjecture 1 and the result of Corollary 1.2 of \cite{L-Y}.
