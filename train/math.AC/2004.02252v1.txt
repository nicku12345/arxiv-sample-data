Given a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring (R,\mathfrak{m},k), we prove that it is almost Gorenstein if and only if \mathfrak{m} is a canonical module of the ring \mathfrak{m}:\mathfrak{m}. Then, we generalize this result by introducing the notions of almost canonical ideal and gAGL ring and by proving that R is gAGL if and only if \mathfrak{m} is an almost canonical ideal of \mathfrak{m}:\mathfrak{m}. We use this fact to characterize when the ring \mathfrak{m}:\mathfrak{m} is almost Gorenstein, provided that R has minimal multiplicity. This is a generalization of a result proved by Chau, Goto, Kumashiro, and Matsuoka in the case in which \mathfrak{m}:\mathfrak{m} is local and its residue field is isomorphic to k.
