Let R be a commutative ring with identity, S be a multiplicatively closed subset of R, and let M be an R-module. In this paper, we introduce the notion of S-2-absorbing second submodules of M as a generalization of S-second submodules and strongly 2-absorbing second submodules of M. We investigate some properties of this class of submodules. Also, we obtain some results concerning S-2-absorbing submodules of M.
