We study the symbolic powers of determinantal ideals of generic, generic symmetric, and Hankel matrices of variables, and of Pfaffians of generic skew-symmetric matrices, in prime characteristic. Specifically, we show that the limit \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{\textrm{reg}(I^{(n)})}{n} exists and that \textrm{depth}(R/I^{(n)}) stabilizes for n\gg 0. Furthermore, we give explicit formulas for the stable value of \textrm{depth}(R/I^{(n)}) in the generic and skew-symmetric cases. In order to show these results, we introduce the notion of symbolic F-purity of ideals which is satisfied by the classes of ideals mentioned above. Moreover, we find several properties satisfied by symbolic F-pure ideals. For example, we show that their symbolic Rees algebras and symbolic associated graded algebras are F-pure. As a consequence, their a-invariants and depths present good behaviors. In addition, we provide a Fedder's-like Criterion for symbolic F-purity.
