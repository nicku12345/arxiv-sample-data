We produce a family of complexes called trimming complexes and explore applications. We study how trimming complexes can be used to deduce the Betti table for the minimal free resolution of the ideal generated by subsets of a generating set for an arbitrary ideal I. In particular, we compute the Betti table for removing an arbitrary generator from the ideal of submaximal pfaffians of a generic skew symmetric matrix M. We also explicitly compute the Betti table for the ideal generated by certain subsets of the generating set of the ideal of maximal minors of a generic n \times m matrix. Such ideals are a subset of a class of ideals called determinantal facet ideals, whose higher degree Betti numbers had not previously been computed.
