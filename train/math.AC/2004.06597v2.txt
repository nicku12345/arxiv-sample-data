Let R=\mathbb{K}[X_1, \ldots , X_n ] be a polynomial ring over a field \mathbb{K}. We introduce an endomorphism \mathcal{F}^{[m]}: R \rightarrow R  and denote the image of an ideal I of R via this endomorphism as I^{[m]} and call it to be the m \textit{-th square power} of I. In this article, we study some homological invariants of I^{[m]} such as regularity, projective dimension, associated primes and depth for some families of ideals e.g. monomial ideals.
