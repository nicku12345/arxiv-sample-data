Let R be a complete regular local ring with an algebraically closed residue field and let A be a Noetherian R-subalgebra of the polynomial ring R[X]. It has been shown in \cite{DO2} that if \dim R=1, then A is necessarily finitely generated over R. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for A to be finitely generated over R when \dim R=2 and present an example of a Noetherian normal non-finitely generated R-subalgebra of R[X] over R= {\mathbb C}[[u, v]].
