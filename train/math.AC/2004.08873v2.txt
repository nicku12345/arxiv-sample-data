Let (R, \frak m) be a generalized Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d, and f_1, \ldots, f_r a part of system of parameters of R. In this paper we give explicit numbers N such that the lengths of all lower local cohomology modules and the Hilbert function of R/(f_1, \ldots, f_r) are preserved when we perturbs the sequence f_1, \ldots, f_r by \varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_r \in {\frak m}^N. The second assertion extends a previous result of Srinivas and Trivedi for generalized Cohen-Macaulay rings.
