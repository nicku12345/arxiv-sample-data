Let k be a field of characteristic 0. Using the method of idealization, we show that there is a non-Koszul, quadratic, Artinian, Gorenstein, standard graded k-algebra of regularity 3 and codimension 8, answering a question of Mastroeni, Schenck, and Stillman. We also show that this example is minimal in the sense that no other idealization that is non-Koszul, quadratic, Artinian, Gorenstein algebra, with regularity 3 has smaller codimension.   We also construct an infinite family of graded, quadratic, Artinian, Gorenstein algebras A_m, indexed by an integer m \ge 2, with the following properties: (1) there are minimal first syzygies of the defining ideal in degree m+2, (2) for m \ge 3, A_m is not Koszul, (3) for m \ge 7, the Hilbert function of A_m is not unimodal, and thus (4) for m \ge 7, A_m does not satisfy the weak or strong Lefschetz properties. In particular, the subadditivity property fails for quadratic Gorenstein ideals.   Finally, we show that the idealization of a construction of Roos yields non-Koszul quadratic Gorenstein algebras such that the residue field k has a linear resolution for precisely \alpha steps for any integer \alpha \ge 2. Thus there is no finite test for the Koszul property even for quadratic Gorenstein algebras.
