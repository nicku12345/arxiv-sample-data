In this paper, we focus on the initial degree and the vanishing of the Valabrega-Valla module of a pair of monomials ideals J\subseteq I in a polynomials ring over a field \mathbb{K}. We prove that the initial degree of this module is bounded above by the maximum degree of a minimal generators of J. For edge ideals of graphs, a complete characterization of the vanishing of the Valabrega-Valla module is given. For higher degree ideals, we find classes which the Valabrega-Valla module vanishes. For the case that J is the facet ideal of a clutter \mathcal{C} and I is the defining ideal of singular subscheme of J, the non-vanishing of this module is investigated in terms of the combinatorics of \mathcal{C}. Finally, we describe the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of I/J provided that the Valabrega-Valla module is zero.
