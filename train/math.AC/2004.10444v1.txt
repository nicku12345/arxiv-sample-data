We prove a version of a Nullstellensatz for partial exponential fields (K,E), even though the ring of exponential polynomials K[X_1,\ldots,X_n]^E is not a Hilbert ring. We show that under certain natural conditions one can embed an ideal of K[X_1,\ldots,X_n]^E into an exponential ideal. In case the ideal consists of exponential polynomials with one iteration of the exponential function, we show that these conditions can be met. We apply our results to the case of ordered exponential fields.
