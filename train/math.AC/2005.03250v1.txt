Given a standard graded polynomial ring over a commutative Noetherian ring A, we prove that the cohomological dimension and the height of the ideals defining any of its Veronese subrings are equal. This result is due to Ogus when A is a field of characteristic zero, and follows from a result of Peskine and Szpiro when A is a field of positive characteristic; our result applies, for example, when A is the ring of integers.
