We find necessary and sufficient conditions for a complete local ring containing the rationals to be the completion of a countable excellent local (Noetherian) domain. Furthermore, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for a complete local ring to be the completion of a countable noncatenary local domain, as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be the completion of a countable noncatenary local unique factorization domain.
