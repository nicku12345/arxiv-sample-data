Let R be a commutative ring with identity. The ring R\times R can be viewed as an extension of R via the diagonal map \Delta: R \hookrightarrow R\times R, given by \Delta(r) = (r, r) for all r\in R. It is shown that, for any a, b\in R, the extension \Delta(R)[(a,b)] \subset R\times R is a minimal ring extension if and only if the ideal <a-b> is a maximal ideal of R. A complete classification of maximal subrings of R(+)R is also given. The minimal ring extension of a von Neumann regular ring R is either a von Neumann regular ring or the idealization R(+)R/\mathfrak{m} where \mathfrak{m}\in \text{Max}(R). If R\subset T is a minimal ring extension and T is an integral domain, then (R:T) = 0 if and only if R is a field and T is a minimal field extension of R, or R_J is a valuation ring of altitude one and T_{J} is its quotient field.
