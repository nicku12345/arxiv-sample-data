In this article, we introduce and study the concept of \phi-2-absorbing quasi primary ideals in commutative rings. Let R be a commutative ring with a nonzero identity and L(R) be the lattice of all ideals of R. Suppose that \phi:L(R)\rightarrow L(R)\cup\left\{ \emptyset\right\}  is a function. A proper ideal I of R is called a \phi-2-absorbing quasiprimary ideal of R if a,b,c\in R and whenever abc\in I-\phi(I), then either ab\in\sqrt{I} or ac\in\sqrt{I} or bc\in\sqrt{I}. In addition to giving many properties of \phi-2-absorbing quasi primary ideals, we also use them to characterize von Neumann regular rings.
