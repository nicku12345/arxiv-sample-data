In this study, all rings are commutative with non-zero identity and all modules are considered to be unital. Let M be a left R-module. A proper submodule N of M is called an S-weakly prime submodule if 0_{M}\neq f(m)\in N implies that either m\in N or f(M)\subseteq N, where f\in S=End(M) and m\in M. Some results concerning S-prime and S-weakly prime submodules are obtained. Then we study S-prime and S-weakly prime submodules of multiplication modules. Also for R-modules M_{1} and M_{2}, we examine S-prime and S-weakly prime submodules of M=M_{1}\times M_{2}, where S=S_{1}\times S_{2}, S_{1}=End(M_{1}) and S_{2}=End(M_{2}).
