We find necessary and sufficient conditions for a complete local (Noetherian) ring to be the completion of an uncountable local (Noetherian) domain with a countable spectrum. Our results suggest that uncountable local domains with countable spectra are more common than previously thought. We also characterize completions of uncountable excellent local domains with countable spectra assuming the completion contains the rationals, completions of uncountable local unique factorization domains with countable spectra, completions of uncountable noncatenary local domains with countable spectra, and completions of uncountable noncatenary local unique factorization domains with countable spectra.
