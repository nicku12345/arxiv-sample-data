We study ideals which are generated by monomials of degree d in the polynomial ring in n variables and which satisfy certain numerical side conditions regarding their exponents. Typical examples of such ideals are the ideals of Veronese type, squarefree Veronese ideals or t-spread Veronese ideals. In this paper we focus on c-bounded t-spread Veronese ideals and on Veronese ideals of bounded support. Their powers as well as their fiber cone is also be considered.
