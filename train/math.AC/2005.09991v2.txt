This paper studies the numbers of minimal generators of powers of monomial ideals in polynomial rings. For a monomial ideal I in two variables, Eliahou, Herzog, and Saem gave a sharp lower bound \mu (I^2)\ge 9 for the number of minimal generators of I^2 with \mu(I)\geq 6. Recently, Gasanova constructed monomial ideals such that \mu(I)>\mu(I^n) for any positive integer n. In reference to them, we construct a certain class of monomial ideals such that \mu(I)>\mu(I^2)>\cdots >\mu(I^n)=(n+1)^2 for any positive integer n, which provides one of the most unexpected behaviors of the function \mu(I^k). The monomial ideals also give a peculiar example such that the Cohen-Macaulay type (or the index of irreducibility) of R/I^n descends.
