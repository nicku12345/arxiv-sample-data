Let G be a group acting via ring automorphisms on an integral domain R. A ring-theoretic property of R is said to be G-invariant, if R^G also has the property, where R^G=\{r\in R \ | \ \sigma(r)=r \ \text{for all} \ \sigma\in G\}, the fixed ring of the action. In this paper we prove the following classes of rings are invariant under the operation R\rightarrow R^G: locally pqr domains, Strong G-domains, G-domains, Hilbert rings, S-strong rings and root-closed domains. Further let \mathscr{P} be a ring theoretic property and R\subseteq S be a ring extension. A pair of rings (R,S) is said to be a \mathscr{P}-pair, if T satisfies \mathscr{P} for each intermediate ring R\subseteq T\subseteq S. We also prove that the property \mathscr{P} descends from (R,S)\rightarrow (R^G, S^G) in several cases. For instance, if \mathscr{P}= Going-down, Pseudo-valuation domain and "finite length of intermediate chains of domains", we show each of these properties successfully transfer from (R,S)\rightarrow (R^G, S^G).
