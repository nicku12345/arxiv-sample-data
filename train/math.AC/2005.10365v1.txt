This paper introduce and study weakly 1-absorbing prime ideals in commutative rings. Let A be a commutative ring with a nonzero identity 1\neq 0. A proper ideal P of A is said to be a weakly 1-absorbing prime ideal if for each nonunits x, y, z \in A with 0\neq xyz \in P, then either xy \in P or z \in P. In addition to give many properties and characterizations of weakly 1-absorbing prime ideals, we also determine rings in which every proper ideal is weakly 1-absorbing prime. Furthermore, we investigate weakly 1-absorbing prime ideals in C(X), which is the ring of continuous functions of a topological space X.
