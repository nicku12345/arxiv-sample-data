Let R be a standard graded polynomial ring that is finitely generated over a field, and let I be a homogenous prime ideal of R. Bhatt, Blickle, Lyubeznik, Singh, and Zhang examined the local cohomology of R/I^t, as t grows arbitrarily large. Such rings are known as thickenings of R/I. We consider R = \mathbb{F}[X] where \mathbb{F} is a field of characteristic 0, X is a 2 \times m matrix, and I is the ideal generated by size two minors. We give concrete constructions for the local cohomology modules of thickenings of R/I. Bizarrely, these local cohomology modules can be described using the Taylor series of natural log.
