In this paper we are concerned with a long-standing conjecture of Huneke and Wiegand. We introduce a new class of ideals and prove thateach ideal from such class satisfies the conclusion of the conjecture in question. We also study the relation between the class of Burch ideals and that of the ideals we define, and construct several examples that corroborate our results.
