One focus on the structure of a homogeneous Gorenstein ideal I of codimension three in a standard polynomial ring R=\kk[x_1,\ldots,x_n] over a field, assuming that I is generated in a fixed degree d. This degree is tied to the minimal number of generators of I and the degree of the entries of an associated skew-symmetric matrix and one shows, conversely, in a characteristic-free way, that any such data are fulfilled by some Gorenstein ideal. It is proved that a codimension 3 homogeneous Gorenstein ideal I\subset \kk[x,y,z] cannot be generated by general forms of fixed degree, except precisely when d=2 or the ideal is a complete intersection.The question as to when the link (\ell_1^m,\ldots,\ell_n^m):\mathfrak{f} is equigenerated, where \ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n are independent linear forms and \mathfrak{f} is a form, is given a solution in some important cases.
