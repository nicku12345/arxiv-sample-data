In this paper, we introduce \phi-1-absorbing prime ideals in commutative rings. Let R be a commutative ring with a nonzero identity 1\neq0 and \phi:\mathcal{I}(R)\rightarrow\mathcal{I}(R)\cup\{\emptyset\} be a function where \mathcal{I}(R) is the set of all ideals of R. A proper ideal I of R is called a \phi-1-absorbing prime ideal if for each nonunits x,y,z\in R with xyz\in I-\phi(I), then either xy\in I or z\in I. In addition to give many properties and characterizations of \phi-1-absorbing prime ideals, we also determine rings in which every proper ideal is \phi-1-absorbing prime.
