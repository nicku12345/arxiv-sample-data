We are interested in characterising the commutative rings for which a 1-tilting cotorsion pair (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}) provides for covers, that is when the class \mathcal{A} is a covering class. We use Hrbek's bijective correspondence between the 1-tilting cotorsion pairs over a commutative ring R and the faithful finitely generated Gabriel topologies on R. Moreover, we use results of Bazzoni-Positselski, in particular a generalisation of Matlis equivalence and their characterisation of covering classes for 1-tilting cotorsion pairs arising from flat injective ring epimorphisms. Explicitly, if \mathcal{G} is the Gabriel topology associated to the 1-tilting cotorsion pair (\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}), and R_\mathcal{G} is the ring of quotients with respect to \mathcal{G}, we show that if \mathcal{A} is covering then \mathcal{G} is a perfect localisation (in Stenstr\"om's sense) and the localisation R_\mathcal{G} has projective dimension at most one. Moreover, we show that \mathcal{A} is covering if and only if both the localisation R_\mathcal{G} and the quotient rings R/J are perfect rings for every J \in \mathcal{G}. Rings satisfying the latter two conditions are called \mathcal{G}-almost perfect.
