The notion of strict closedness of rings was given by J. Lipman in connection with a conjecture of O. Zariski. The present purpose is to give a practical method of construction of strictly closed rings. It is also shown that the Stanley-Reisner rings of simplicial complexes (resp. F-pure rings satisfying the condition (S_2) of Serre) are strictly closed (resp. weakly Arf) rings.
