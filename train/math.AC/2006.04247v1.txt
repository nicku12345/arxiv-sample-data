For any ideal I of finite projective dimension in a commutative noetherian ring R, we prove that if the conormal module I/I^2 has finite projective dimension over R/I, then I must be locally generated by a regular sequence. This resolves a conjecture of Vasconcelos. We prove similar results for the first Koszul homology of I, and (with certain caveats) for the module of K\"ahler differentials of R/I. The arguments exploit the structure of the homotopy Lie algebra in an essential way.
