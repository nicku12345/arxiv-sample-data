We study homological properties of a locally complete intersection ring by importing facts from homological algebra over exterior algebras. One application is showing that the thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of a locally complete intersection ring are self-dual under Grothendieck duality. This was proved by Stevenson when the ring is a quotient of a regular ring modulo a regular sequence; we offer two independent proofs in the more general setting. Second, we use these techniques to supply new proofs that complete intersections possess symmetry of complexity.
