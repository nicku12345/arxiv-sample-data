We introduce a construction, called linearization, that associates to any monomial ideal I an ideal \mathrm{Lin}(I) in a larger polynomial ring. The main feature of this construction is that the new ideal \mathrm{Lin}(I) has linear quotients. In particular, since \mathrm{Lin}(I) is generated in a single degree, it follows that \mathrm{Lin}(I) has a linear resolution. We investigate some properties of this construction, such as its interplay with classical operations on ideals, its Betti numbers, functoriality and combinatorial interpretations. We moreover introduce an auxiliary construction, called equification, that associates to any monomial ideal a new monomial ideal generated in a single degree, in a polynomial ring with one more variable. We study some of the homological and combinatorial properties of the equification, which can be seen as a monomial analogue of the well-known homogenization construction.
