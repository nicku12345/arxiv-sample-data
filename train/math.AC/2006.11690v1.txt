We study Gorenstein ideals of codimension 4 derived from generic doublings of almost complete intersection perfect ideals of codimension 3. We also investigate spinor coordinates of such Gorenstein ideals with 8 and 9 generators. For an ideal J of commutative ring R, the R/J module J/J^2 is called conormal module and R/J-dual of J/J^2 is called normal module. We study properties of conormal and normal modules of almost complete intersection perfect ideals of codimension 3.
