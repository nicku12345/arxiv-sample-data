In this study, we present the generalization of the concept of r-ideals in commutative rings with nonzero identity. Let R be a commutative ring with 0\neq1 and L(R) be the lattice of all ideals of R. Suppose that \phi:L(R)\rightarrow L(R)\cup\left\{\emptyset\right\} is a function. A proper ideal I of R is called a \phi-r-ideal of R if whenever ab\in I and Ann(a)=(0) imply that b\in I for each a,b\in R. In addition to giving many properties of \phi-r-ideal, we also examine the concept of \phi-r-ideal in trivial ring extension and use them to characterize total quotient rings.
