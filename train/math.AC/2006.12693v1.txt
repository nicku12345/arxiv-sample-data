We introduce the notions of Koszul N-complex, \check{\mathrm{C}}ech N-complex and telescope N-complex, explicit derived torsion and derived completion functors in the derived category \mathbf{D}_N(R) of N-complexes using the \check{\mathrm{C}}ech N-complex and the telescope N-complex. Moreover, we give an equivalence between the category of cohomologically \mathfrak{a}-torsion N-complexes and the category of cohomologically \mathfrak{a}-adic complete N-complexes, and prove that over a commutative noetherian ring, via Koszul cohomology, via RHom cohomology (resp. \otimes cohomology) and via local cohomology (resp. derived completion), all yield the same invariant.
