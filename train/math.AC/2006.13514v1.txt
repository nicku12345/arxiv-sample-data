In this paper we study algebraic sets of pairs of matrices defined by the vanishing of either the diagonal of their commutator matrix or its anti-diagonal. We find a system of parameters for the coordinate rings of these two sets and their intersection and show that they are complete intersections. Moreover, we prove that these algebraic sets are F-pure over a field of positive prime characteristic and the algebraic set of pairs of matrices with the zero diagonal commutator is F-regular.
