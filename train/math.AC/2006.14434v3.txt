A determinantal facet ideal (DFI) is generated by a subset of the maximal minors of a generic n\times m matrix indexed by the facets of a simplicial complex. We consider the more general notion of an r-DFI, which is generated by a subset of r-minors of a generic matrix indexed by the facets of a simplicial complex for some 1\leq r\leq n. We define and study so-called lcm-closed and interval DFIs, and show that the minors parametrized by the facets of \Delta form a reduced Gr\"obner basis with respect to any diagonal term order in both of these cases. We also see that being lcm-closed generalizes conditions previously introduced in the literature, and conjecture that in the case r=n, lcm-closedness is necessary for being a Gr\"obner basis. We also give conditions on the maximal cliques of \Delta ensuring that lcm-closed and interval DFIs are Cohen-Macaulay. Finally, we conclude with a variant of a conjecture of Ene, Herzog, and Hibi on the Betti numbers of certain types of r-DFIs, and provide a proof of this conjecture for Cohen-Macaulay interval DFIs.
