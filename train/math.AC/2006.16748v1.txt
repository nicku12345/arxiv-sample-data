Let D be a weighted oriented graph with the underlying graph G when vertices with non-trivial weights are sinks and I(D), I(G)  be the edge ideals corresponding to D and G, respectively. We give explicit description of the symbolic powers of I(D) using the concept of strong vertex covers. We show that the ordinary and symbolic powers of I(D) and I(G) behave in a similar way. We provide a description for symbolic powers and Waldschmidt constant of I(D) for certain classes of weighted oriented graphs. When D is a weighted oriented odd cycle we compute \reg (I(D)^{(s)}/I(D)^s) and prove \reg I(D)^{(s)}\leq\reg I(D)^s and show that equality holds when there is only one vertex with non-trivial weight.
