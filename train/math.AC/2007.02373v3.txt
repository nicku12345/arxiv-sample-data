Let R = k[x_1, \dotsc , x_n] denote the standard graded polynomial ring over a field k. We study certain classes of equigenerated monomial ideals with the property that the so-called complementary ideal has no linear relations on the generators. We then use iterated trimming complexes to deduce Betti numbers for such ideals. Furthermore, using a result on splitting mapping cones by Miller and Rahmati, we construct the minimal free resolutions for all ideals under consideration explicitly and conclude with questions about extra structure on these complexes.
