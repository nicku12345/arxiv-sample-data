Let \mathbf{A}_{n, m} be the polynomial ring \text{Sym}(\mathbf{C}^n \otimes \mathbf{C}^m) with the natural action of \mathbf{GL}_m(\mathbf{C}). We construct a family of \mathbf{GL}_m(\mathbf{C})-stable ideals J_{n, m} in \mathbf{A}_{n, m}, each equivariantly generated by one homogeneous polynomial of degree 2. Using the Ananyan-Hochster principle, we show that the regularity of this family is unbounded. This negatively answers a question raised by Erman-Sam-Snowden on a generalization of Stillman's conjecture.
