Consider the ideal (x_1 , \dotsc , x_n)^d \subseteq k[x_1 , \dotsc , x_n], where k is any field. This ideal can be resolved by both the L-complexes of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud, and the Eliahou-Kervaire resolution. Both of these complexes admit the structure of an associative DG algebra, and it is a question of Peeva as to whether these DG structures coincide in general. In this paper, we give a negative answer to this question, thus adding infinitely many counterexamples to a question of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud. We also give a class of ideals whose minimal free resolution is a DG subalgebra of the Eliahou-Kervaire resolution.
