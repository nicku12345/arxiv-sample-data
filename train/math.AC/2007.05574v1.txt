A commutative ring R is stable if every non-zero ideal I of R is projective over its ring of endomorphisms. Initiated by a paper of Bass in the 1960s, stable rings have received wide attention in the literature ever since then. Much is known on the algebraic structure of stable rings and on the relationship of stability with other algebraic properties such as divisoriality and the 2-generator property. In the present paper we study the arithmetic of stable integral domains, with a focus on arithmetic properties of semigroups of ideals of stable orders in Dedekind domains.
