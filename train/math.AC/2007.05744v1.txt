Let S=K[x_1, \dots, x_m, y_1, \dots, y_n] be the standard bigraded polynomial ring over a field K. Let M be a finitely generated bigraded S-module and Q=(y_1, \dots, y_n). We say M has maximal depth with respect to Q if there is an associated prime \pp of M such that \grade(Q, M)=\cd(Q, S/\pp). In this paper, we study finitely generated bigraded modules with maximal depth with respect to Q. It is shown that sequentially Cohen--Macaulay modules with respect to Q have maximal depth with respect to Q. In fact, maximal depth property generalizes the concept of sequentially Cohen--Macaulayness. Next, we show that if M has maximal depth with respect to Q with \grade(Q, M)>0, then H^{\grade(Q, M)}_{Q}(M) is not finitely generated. As a consequence, "generalized Cohen--Macaulay modules with respect to Q" having "maximal depth with respect to Q" are Cohen--Macaulay with respect to Q. All hypersurface rings that have maximal depth with respect to Q are classified.
