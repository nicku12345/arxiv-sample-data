In this paper, we prove that if R is a local ring of dimension d, d\geq 2 and \frac{1}{d!}\in R then the group \frac{Um_{d+1}(R[X])}{E_{d+1}(R[X])} has no k-torsion, provided k\in GL_{1}(R). We also prove that if R is a regular ring of dimension d, d\geq 2 and \frac{1}{d!}\in R such that E_{d+1}(R) acts transitively on Um_{d+1}(R) then E_{d+1}(R[X]) acts transitively on Um_{d+1}(R[X]).
