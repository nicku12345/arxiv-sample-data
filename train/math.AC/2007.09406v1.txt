A numerical monoid is a cofinite additive submonoid of the nonnegative integers, while a Puiseux monoid is an additive submonoid of the nonnegative cone of the rational numbers. Using that a Puiseux monoid is an increasing union of copies of numerical monoids, we prove that some of the factorization invariants of these two classes of monoids are related through a limiting process. This allows us to extend results from numerical to Puiseux monoids. We illustrate the versatility of this technique by recovering various known results about Puiseux monoids.
