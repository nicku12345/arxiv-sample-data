We provide an expression for the conductor c(\Delta) of a semimodule \Delta of a numerical semigroup \Gamma with two generators in terms of the syzygy module of \Delta and the generators of the semigroup. In particular, we deduce that the difference between the conductor of the semimodule and the conductor of the semigroup is an element of \Gamma, as well as a formula for c(\Delta) in terms of the dual semimodule of \Delta.
