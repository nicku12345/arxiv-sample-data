Given a valuation v on a field K, an extension \bar{v} to an algebraic closure and an extension w to K(X). We want to study the common extensions of \bar{v} and w to \bar{K}(X). First we give a detailed link between the minimal pairs notion and the key polynomials notion. Then we prove that in the case when w is a transcendental extension, then any sequence of key polynomials admits a maximal element, and in case this sequence does not contain a limit key polynomial, then any root of the last key polynomial, describe a common extension.
