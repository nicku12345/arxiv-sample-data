Let S be a standard graded polynomial ring over a field, and I be a homogeneous ideal that contains a regular sequence of degrees d_1,\ldots,d_n. We prove the Eisenbud-Green-Harris conjecture when the forms of the regular sequence satisfy d_i \geqslant \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}(d_j-1), improving a result obtained in 2008 by the first author and Maclagan. Except for the sporadic case of a regular sequence of five quadrics, recently proved by G\"unt\"urk\"un and Hochster, the results of this article recover all known cases of the conjecture where only the degrees of the regular sequence are fixed, and include several additional ones.
