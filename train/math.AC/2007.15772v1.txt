Let R be an algebra essentially of finite type over a field k and let \Omega_k(R) be its module of K\"ahler differentials over k. If R is a homogeneous complete intersection and \mathrm{char}(k)=0, we prove that \Omega_k(R) is of linear type whenever its Rees algebra is Cohen-Macaulay and locally at every homogeneous prime \mathfrak{p} the embedding dimension of R_{\mathfrak{p}} is at most twice its dimension.
