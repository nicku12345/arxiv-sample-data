Let R be a commutative ring with  1 \neq 0. We recall that a proper ideal I of R is called a semiprimary ideal of R if whenever a,b\in R and ab \in I, then a\in \sqrt{I} or b\in \sqrt{I}. We say I is a {\it weakly semiprimary ideal} of R if whenever a,b\in R and 0 \not = ab \in I, then a\in \sqrt{I} or b\in \sqrt{I}. In this paper, we introduce a new class of ideals that is closely related to the class of (weakly) semiprimary ideals. Let I(R) be the set of all ideals of R and let \delta: I(R) \rightarrow I(R) be a function. Then \delta is called an expansion function of ideals of R if whenever L, I, J are ideals of R with J \subseteq I, then L \subseteq \delta(L) and \delta(J) \subseteq \delta(I). Let \delta be an expansion function of ideals of R. Then a proper ideal I of R (i.e., I \not = R) is called a ({\it \delta-semiprimary}) {\it weakly \delta-semiprimary} ideal of R if (ab \in I) 0 \not = ab \in I implies a \in \delta(I) or b \in \delta(I). For example, let \delta: I(R) \rightarrow I(R) such that \delta(I) = \sqrt{I}. Then \delta is an expansion function of ideals of R and hence a proper ideal I of R is a (\delta-semiprimary) weakly \delta-semiprimary ideal of R if and only if I is a (semiprimary) weakly semiprimary ideal of R. A number of results concerning weakly \delta-semiprimary ideals and examples of weakly \delta-semiprimary ideals are given.
