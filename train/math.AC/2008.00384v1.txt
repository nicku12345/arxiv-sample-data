We prove that two arbitrary ideals I \subset J in an equidimensional and universally catenary Noetherian local ring have the same integral closure if and only if they have the same multiplicity sequence. We also obtain a Principle of Specialization of Integral Dependence, which gives a condition for integral dependence in terms of the constancy of the multiplicity sequence in families.
