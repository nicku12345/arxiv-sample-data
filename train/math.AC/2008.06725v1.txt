For a commutative cancellative monoid M, we introduce the notion of the length density of both a nonunit x\in M, denoted \mathrm{LD}(x), and the entire monoid M, denoted \mathrm{LD}(M). This invariant is related to three widely studied invariants in the theory of non-unit factorizations, L(x), \ell(x), and \rho(x). We consider some general properties of \mathrm{LD}(x) and \mathrm{LD}(M) and give a wide variety of examples using numerical semigroups, Puiseux monoids, and Krull monoids. While we give an example of a monoid M with irrational length density, we show that if M is finitely generated, then \mathrm{LD}(M) is rational and there is a nonunit element x\in M with \mathrm{LD}(M)=\mathrm{LD}(x) (such a monoid is said to have accepted length density). While it is well-known that the much studied asymptotic versions of L(x), \ell (x) and \rho (x) (denoted \overline{L}(x), \overline{\ell}(x), and \overline{\rho} (x)) always exist, we show the somewhat surprising result that \overline{\mathrm{LD}}(x) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mathrm{LD}(x^n) may not exist. We also give some finiteness conditions on M that force the existence of \overline{\mathrm{LD}}(x).
