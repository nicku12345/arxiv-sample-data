Let G be a group with identity e. Let R be a G-graded commutative ring and M a graded R-module. In this paper, we introduce the concept of graded primary-like submodules as a new generalization of graded primary ideals and give some basic results about graded primary-like submodules of graded modules. Special attention has been paid, when graded submodules satisfies the gr-primeful property, to find extra properties of these graded submodules.
