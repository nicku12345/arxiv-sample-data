One says that a ring homomorphism R \rightarrow S is Ohm-Rush if extension commutes with arbitrary intersection of ideals, or equivalently if for any element f\in S, there is a unique smallest ideal of R whose extension to S contains f, called the content of f. For Noetherian local rings, we analyze whether the completion map is Ohm-Rush. We show that the answer is typically `yes' in dimension one, but `no' in higher dimension, and in any case it coincides with the content map having good algebraic properties. We then analyze the question of when the Ohm-Rush property globalizes in faithfully flat modules and algebras over a 1-dimensional Noetherian domain, culminating both in a positive result and a counterexample. Finally, we introduce a notion that we show is strictly between the Ohm-Rush property and the weak content algebra property.
