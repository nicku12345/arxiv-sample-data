Using SAGBI basis techniques, we find Gr\"obner bases for the presentation ideals of the Rees algebra and special fiber ring of a closed determinantal facet ideal. In particular, we show that closed determinantal facet ideals are of fiber type and their special fiber rings are Koszul. Moreover, their Rees algebras and special fiber rings are normal Cohen-Macaulay domains, and have rational singularities.
