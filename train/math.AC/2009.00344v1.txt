Let S \subset R be an arbitrary subset of a unique factorization domain R and \K be the field of fractions of R. The ring of integer-valued polynomials over S is the set \mathrm{Int}(S,R)= \{ f \in \mathbb{K}[x]: f(a) \in R\ \forall\ a \in S \}. This article is an effort to study the irreducibility of integer-valued polynomials over arbitrary subsets of a unique factorization domain. We give a method to construct special kinds of sequences, which we call d-sequences. We then use these sequences to obtain a criteria for the irreducibility of the polynomials in \mathrm{Int}(S,R). In some special cases, we explicitly construct these sequences and use these sequences to check the irreducibility of some polynomials in \mathrm{Int}(S,R). At the end, we suggest a generalization of our results to an arbitrary subset of a Dedekind domain.
