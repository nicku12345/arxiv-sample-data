Let \mathfrak a be an ideal of a commutative Noetherian ring R, and let M and N be two finitely generated R-modules such that N is Gorenstein. For each integer t, we give some bounds under inclusion for the annihilators of \operatorname{Ext}^t_R(M, N) and   \operatorname{H}^t_{\mathfrak a}(M) in terms of minimal primary decomposition of the zero submodule of M which are independent of the choice of minimal primary decomposition. Then, by using those bounds, we compute the annihilators of local cohomology and Ext modules in certain cases.
