The notion of maximal non valuative domain is introduced and characterized. An integral domain R is called a maximal non valuative domain if R is not a valuative domain but every proper overring of R is a valuative domain. Maximal non valuative domains have at most four maximal ideals. Various properties of maximal non valuative domains are discussed. Conditions are given under which pseudo-valuation domains and maximal non pseudo-valuation domains are maximal non valuative domains.
