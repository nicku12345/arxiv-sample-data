In this work we present descriptions of prime ideals and in particular of maximal ideals in products R = \prod D_\lambda of families (D_\lambda)_{\lambda \in \Lambda} of commutative rings. We show that every maximal ideal is induced by an ultrafilter on the Boolean algebra \prod \mathcal{P}(\max(D_\lambda)). If every D_\lambda is in a certain class of rings including finite character domains and one-dimensional domains, then this leads to a characterization of the maximal ideals of R. If every D_\lambda is a Pr\"ufer domain, we depict all prime ideals of R. Moreover, we give an example of a (optionally non-local or local) Pr\"ufer domain such that every non-zero prime ideal is of infinite height.
