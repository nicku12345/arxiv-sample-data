The notion off-ideals is recent and has been studied in the papers[1] [2], [5], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] and [15]. In this paper, we have generalized the idea off-ideals to quasi f-ideals. This extended class of ideals is much bigger than the class of all f-ideals. Apart from giving various characterizations of quasi f-ideals of degree 2, we have determined all the minimal primes ideals of these ideals. Moreover, construction of quasi f-ideals of degree 2 has been described; the formula for computing Hilbert function and Hilbert series of the polynomial ring modulo quasi f-ideal has been provided.
