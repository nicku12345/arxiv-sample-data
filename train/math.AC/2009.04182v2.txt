Let D be a domain and let S be a torsion-free monoid whose quotient group satisfies the ascending chain condition on cyclic subgroups. We give a characterization of when the monoid algebra D[S] is weakly Krull. As corollaries, we obtain the results on when D[S] is Krull resp. generalized Krull, due to Chouinard resp. El Baghdadi and Kim. Furthermore, we deduce Chang's theorem on weakly factorial monoid algebras and we characterize the weakly Krull domains among the affine monoid algebras.
