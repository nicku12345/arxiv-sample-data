The main goal of this paper is to characterize limit key polynomials for a valuation \nu on K[x]. We consider the set \Psi_\alpha of key polynomials for \nu of degree \alpha. We set p be the exponent characteristic of \nu. Our first main result (Theorem 1.1) is that if Q_\alpha is a limit key polynomial for \Psi_\alpha, then the degree of Q_\alpha is p^r\alpha for some r\in\mathbb N. Moreover, in Theorem 1.2, we show that there exist Q\in\Psi_\alpha and Q_\alpha a limit key polynomial for \Psi_\alpha, such that the Q-expansion of Q_\alpha only has terms which are powers of p.
