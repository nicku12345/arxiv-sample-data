It is shown that if R is a ring, p a prime element of an integral domain D\leq R with \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty p^nD=0 and p\in U(R), then R has a conch maximal subring (see \cite{faith}). We prove that either a ring R has a conch maximal subring or U(S)=S\cap U(R) for each subring S of R (i.e., each subring of R is closed with respect to taking inverse, see \cite{invsub}). In particular, either R has a conch maximal subring or U(R) is integral over the prime subring of R. We observe that if R is an integral domain with |R|=2^{2^{\aleph_0}}, then either R has a maximal subring or |Max(R)|=2^{\aleph_0}, and in particular if in addition dim(R)=1, then R has a maximal subring. If R\subseteq T be an integral ring extension, Q\in Spec(T), P:=Q\cap R, then we prove that whenever R has a conch maximal subring S with (S:R)=P, then T has a conch maximal subring V such that (V:T)=Q and V\cap R=S. It is shown that if K is an algebraically closed field which is not algebraic over its prime subring and R is affine ring over K, then for each prime ideal P of R with ht(P)\geq dim(R)-1, there exists a maximal subring S of R with (S:R)=P. If R is a normal affine integral domain over a field K, then we prove that R is an integrally closed maximal subring of a ring T if and only if dim(R)=1 and in particular in this case (R:T)=0.
