We prove that deformation of F-injectivity holds for local rings (R,\mathfrak{m}) that admit secondary representations of H^i_{\mathfrak{m}}(R) which are stable under the natural Frobenius action. As a consequence, F-injectivity deforms when (R,\mathfrak{m}) is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay (or more generally when all the local cohomology modules H^i_{\mathfrak{m}}(R) have no embedded attached primes). We obtain some additional cases if R/\mathfrak{m} is perfect or if R is \mathbb{N}-graded.
