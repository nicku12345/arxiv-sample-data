Let \mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b} be two ideals of a commutative noetherian ring R and M a finitely generated R-module.~We continue to study \textrm{f}\textrm{-}\mathrm{grad}_R(\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b},M) which was introduced in [Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc. 38 (2015) 467--482], some computations and bounds of \textrm{f}\textrm{-}\mathrm{grad}_R(\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b},M) are provided.~We also give the structure of (\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b})-\mathrm{f}-modules,~various properties which are analogous to those of Cohen Macaulay modules are discovered.
