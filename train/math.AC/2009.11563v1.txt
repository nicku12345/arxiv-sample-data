Let \underline{x} = x_1,\ldots,x_k denote an ordered sequence of elements of a commutative ring R. Let M be an R-module. We recall the two notions that \underline{x} is M-proregular given by Greenlees and May (see \cite{[5]}) and Lipman (see \cite{[1]}) and show that both notions are equivalent. As a main result we prove a cohomological characterization for \underline{x} to be M-proregular in terms of \v{C}ech homology. This implies also that \underline{x} is M-weakly proregular if it is M-proregular. A local-global principle for proregularity and weakly proregularity is proved. This is used for a result about prisms as introduced by Bhatt and Scholze (see \cite{[3]}).
