Let R be a finite commutative ring with 1\ne 0. The set \mathcal{F}(R) of polynomial functions on R is a finite commutative ring with pointwise operations. Its group of units \mathcal{F}(R)^\times is just the set of all unit-valued polynomial functions, that is the set of polynomial functions which map R into its group of units. We show that \mathcal{P}_R(R[x]/(x^2)) the group of polynomial permutations on the ring R[x]/(x^2), consisting of permutations represented by polynomials over R, is embedded in a semidirect product of \mathcal{F}(R)^\times by \mathcal{P}(R) the group of polynomial permutations on R. In particular, when R=\mathbb{F}_q, we prove that \mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{F}_q}(\mathbb{F}_q[x]/(x^2))\cong \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F}_q) \ltimes_\theta \mathcal{F}(\mathbb{F}_q)^\times. Furthermore, we count unit-valued polynomial functions \pmod{p^n} and obtain canonical representations for these functions.
