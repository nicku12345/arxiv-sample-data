We already know that there is an explicit formula for defining equations of multi-Rees algebra of a family of ideals, when each of these ideals contains at least one nonzero divisor. However, this formula is not true, when at least one of these ideals does not contain any nonzero divisor. In this paper we give an explicit formula for defining equations of the multi-Rees algebra of any family of ideals of polynomial rings over principal ideal rings. In general some of these ideals may not contain any nonzero divisors. Given this explicit formula, we compute Gr\"{o}bner basis of defining equations using an elimination order.
