This thesis is comprised of three chapters. The first chapter deals with bounded complexes of Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules. Deploying methods of relative homological algebra, we approximate such complexes with bounded complexes of projective and injective modules, respectively. As an application, we investigate the Gorenstein version of the New Intersection Theorem.   The second chapter studies the notion of cofiniteness for modules and complexes set forth by Hartshorne. Recruiting techniques of derived category, we study this notion thoroughly, obtain novel results, and extend some of the results to stable under specialization sets.   The third chapter delves into the Greenlees-May Duality Theorem which is widely thought of as a far-reaching generalization of the Grothendieck's Local Duality Theorem. This theorem is not addressed in the literature as it merits and its proof is indeed a tangled web in a series of scattered papers. By carefully scrutinizing the requisite tools, we present a clear-cut well-documented proof of this theorem.
