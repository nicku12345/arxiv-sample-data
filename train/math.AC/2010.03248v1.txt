Let R be a commutative ring, we say that \mathcal{A}\subseteq Spec(R) has prime avoidance property, if I\subseteq \bigcup_{P\in\mathcal{A}}P for an ideal I of R, then there exists P\in\mathcal{A} such that I\subseteq P. We exactly determine when \mathcal{A}\subseteq Spec(R) has prime avoidance property. In particular, if \mathcal{A} has prime avoidance property, then \mathcal{A} is compact. For certain classical rings we show the converse holds (such as Bezout rings, QR-domains, zero-dimensional rings and C(X)). We give an example of a compact set \mathcal{A}\subseteq Spec(R), where R is a Prufer domain, which has not P.A-property. Finally, we show that if V,V_1,\ldots, V_n are valuation domains for a field K and V[x]\nsubseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n V_i for some x\in K, then there exists v\in V such that v+x\notin \bigcup_{i=1}^n V_i.
