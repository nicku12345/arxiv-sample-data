An Ohm-Rush algebra R \rightarrow S is called *McCoy* if for any zero-divisor f in S, its content c(f) has nonzero annihilator in R, because McCoy proved this when S=R[x]. We answer a question of Nasehpour by giving an example of a faithfully flat Ohm-Rush algebra with the McCoy property that is not a weak content algebra. However, we show that a faithfully flat Ohm-Rush algebra is a weak content algebra iff R/I \rightarrow S/I S is McCoy for all radical (resp. prime) ideals I of R. When R is Noetherian (or has the more general \emph{fidel (A)} property), we show that it is equivalent that R/I \rightarrow S/IS is McCoy for all ideals.
