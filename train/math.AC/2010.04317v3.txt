For positive integers d<n, let [n]_d=\{A\in 2^{[n]}\mid |A|=d\} where [n]=:\{1,2,\ldots, n\}. For a pure f-simplicial complex \Delta such that {\rm dim}(\Delta)={\rm dim}(\Delta^c) and \mathcal{F}(\Delta)\cap \mathcal{F}(\Delta^c)=\emptyset, we prove that the facet ideal I(\Delta) is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it has linear resolution. For a d-dimensional pure f-simplicial complex \Delta such that \Delta'=:\langle F\mid F\in [n]_d\smallsetminus \mathcal F(\Delta)\rangle is an f-simplicial complex, we prove that I(\Delta^c) is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if I(\Delta') has linear resolution.
