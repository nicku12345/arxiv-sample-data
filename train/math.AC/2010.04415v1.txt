Let R be a commutative ring with nonzero identity. A. Yassine et al. defined in the paper (Yassine, Nikmehr and Nikandish, 2020), the concept of 1-absorbing prime ideals as follows: a proper ideal I of R is said to be a 1-absorbing prime ideal if whenever xyz\in I for some nonunit elements x,y,z\in R, then either xy\in I or z\in\ I. We use the concept of 1-absorbing prime ideals to study those commutative rings in which every proper ideal is a product of 1-absorbing prime ideals (we call them OAF-rings). Any OAF-ring has dimension at most one and local OAF-domains (D,M) are atomic such that M^2 is universal.
