For a partition \lambda of n \in \mathbb{N}, let I^{\rm Sp}_\lambda be the ideal of R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n] generated by all Specht polynomials of shape \lambda. For the simplicity, we assume that {\rm char}(K)=0 here. In the previous papers, we have shown that R/I^{\rm Sp}_{(n-2,2)} is Gorenstein, and R/I^{\rm Sp}_{(d,d,1)} is Cohen-Macaulay, and has a linear free resolution. In this paper, we construct minimal free resolutions of these rings using Specht modules.
