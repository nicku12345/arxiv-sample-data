Let R be a local ring and C a semidualizing module of R. We investigate the behavior of certain classes of generalized Cohen-Macaulay R-modules under the Foxby equivalence between the Auslander and Bass classes with respect to C. In particular, we show that generalized Cohen-Macaulay R-modules are invariant under this equivalence and if M is a finitely generated R-module in the Auslander class with respect to C such that C\otimes_RM is surjective Buchsbaum, then M is also surjective Buchsbaum.
