We present stdPairs.spyx, a SageMath library to compute standard pairs of a monomial ideal over a pointed (non-normal) affine semigroup ring. Moreover, stdPairs.spyx provides the associated prime ideals, the corresponding multiplicities, and an irredundant irreducible primary decomposition of a monomial ideal. The library expands on the standardPairs function on Macaulay2 over polynomial rings, and is based on algorithms from arXiv:2005.10968v2 [math.AC]. We also provide methods that allow the outputs from this library to be compatible with the Normaliz package of Macaulay2 and SageMath.
