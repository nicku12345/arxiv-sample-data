The theory of mixed multiplicities of (not necessarily Noetherian) filtrations of m_R-primary ideals in a Noetherian local ring R, has been developed by Cutkosky, Sarkar and Srinivasan. The objective of this article is to generalise a Minkowski type inequality given in their paper. We also recover a result of Cutkosky, Srinivasan and Verma as a simple consequence of our inequality
