We study the minimal bigraded free resolution of an ideal with three generators of the same bidegree, contained in the bihomogeneous maximal ideal  \langle s,t\rangle \cap \langle u,v \rangle of the bigraded ring K[s,t;u,v]. Our analysis involves tools from algebraic geometry (Segre-Veronese varieties), classical commutative algebra (Buchsbaum-Eisenbud criteria for exactness, Hilbert-Burch theorem), and homological algebra (Koszul homology, spectral sequences). We treat in detail the case in which the bidegree is (1,n). We connect our work to a conjecture of Fr\"oberg-Lundqvist on bigraded Hilbert functions, and close with a number of open problems.
