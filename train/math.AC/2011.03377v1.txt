This paper introduces and studies homological properties of new classes of modules, namely, the \mathcal F_1-flat modules and the \mathcal F_1^{\fp}-flat modules, where \mathcal F_1 stands for the class of right modules of flat dimension at most one and \mathcal F_1^{\fp} its subclass consisting of finitely presented elements. This leads us to introduce a new class of rings that we term \mathcal F_1^{\fp}-coherent rings as they behave nicely with respect to \mathcal F_1^{\fp}-flat modules as do coherent rings with respect to flat modules. The new class of \mathcal F_1^{\fp}-coherent rings turns out to be a large one and it includes coherent rings, perfect rings, semi-hereditary rings and all rings R such that \lim\limits_{\lr}\mathcal P_1=\mathcal F_1. As a particular case of rings satisfying \lim\limits_{\lr}\mathcal P_1=\mathcal F_1 figures the important class of integral domains.
