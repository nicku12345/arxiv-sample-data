In this paper we study Cohen-Macaulay local rings of dimension d, multiplicity e and second Hilbert coefficient e_2 in the case e_2 = e_1 - e + 1. Let h = \mu(\mathfrak{m}) - d. If e_2 \neq 0 then in our case we can prove that type A \geq e - h -1. If type A = e - h -1 then we show that the associated graded ring G(A) is Cohen-Macaulay. In the next case when type A = e - h we determine all possible Hilbert series of A. In this case we show that the Hilbert Series of A completely determines depth G(A).
