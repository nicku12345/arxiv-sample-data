In this article I consider polynomial composites with the coefficients from K\subset L. We already know many properties, but we do not know the answer to the question of whether there is a relationship between composites and field extensions. I present the characterization of some known field extensions in terms of polynomial composites. I end this article by opening the problem of characterization of ideals in polynomial composites with respect to various field extensions.
