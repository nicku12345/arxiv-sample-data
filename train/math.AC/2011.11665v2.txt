Two ideals I and J are called transverse if I \cap J = IJ. We show that the obstructions defined by Avramov for classes of (sequentially) transverse ideals in regular local rings are always 0. In particular, we compute an explicit free resolution and Koszul homology for all such ideals, also showing that the multiplication in the Tor-algebra is always trivial in positive homological degrees. We conclude with questions about the existence of associative multiplicative structures on the minimal free resolution of the quotient defined by products of transverse ideals.
