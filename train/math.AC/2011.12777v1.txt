In this paper I consider the construction of K + M, where K is the domain, M is the maximal ideal of a some ring of polynomials with coefficients from the field L, where K is its subring. In addition to the usual domains, we also consider the Noetherian, Prufer and GCD-domains. In particular, polynomial composites are a case of K + M construction. In this paper we will find numerous construction conclusions related to polynomial composites.
