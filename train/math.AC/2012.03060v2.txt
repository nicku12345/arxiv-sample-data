Let R be a commutative ring with identity and let M be an R-module which is generated by \mu elements but not fewer. We denote by \operatorname{SL}_n(R) the group of the n \times n matrices over R with determinant 1. We denote by \operatorname{E}_n(R) the subgroup of \operatorname{SL}_n(R) generated by the the matrices which differ from the identity by a single off-diagonal coefficient. Given n \ge \mu and G \in \left\{\operatorname{SL}_n(R),\operatorname{E}_n(R)\right\}, we study the action of G by matrix right-multiplication on \operatorname{V}_n(M), the set of elements of M^n whose components generate M. Assuming that M is finitely presented and that R is an elementary divisor ring or an almost local-global coherent Pr\"ufer ring, we obtain a description of \operatorname{V}_n(M)/G which extends the author's earlier result on finitely generated modules over quasi-Euclidean rings.
