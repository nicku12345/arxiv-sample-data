We build on the correspondence between abstract key polynomials and minimal pairs made by Novacoski and show how to relate the valuations that are generated by each object. We can then give a geometric interpretation of valuations built in this fashion. To do so we employ an object called diskoid, which is a generalisation of the classical concept of ball in non-archimedian valued fields.
