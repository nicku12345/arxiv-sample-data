We make explicit the exponential bound on the degrees of the polynomials appearing in the Effective Quillen-Suslin Theorem, and apply it jointly with the Hilbert-Burch Theorem to show that the syzygy module of a sequence of m polynomials in n variables defining a complete intersection ideal of grade two is free, and that a basis of it can be computed with bounded degrees. In the known cases, these bounds improve previous results.
