Let D be an integral domain with quotient field K, throughout. Call two elements x,y\in D\backslash \{0\} v-coprime if xD\cap yD=xyD. Call a nonzero non unit r of an integral domain D rigid if for all x,y|r we have x|y or y|x. Also call D semirigid if every nonzero non unit of D is expressible as a finite product of rigid elements. We show that a semirigid domain D is a GCD domain if and only if D satisfies \ast : product of every pair of non-v-coprime rigid elements is again rigid. Next call a\in D a valuation element if aV\cap D=aD for some valuation ring % V  with D\subseteq V\subseteq K and call D a VFD if every nonzero non unit of D is a finite product of valuation elements. It turns out that a valuation element is what we call a packed element: a rigid element r all of whose powers are rigid and \sqrt{rD} is a prime ideal. Calling D a semi packed domain (SPD) if every nonzero non unit of D is a finite product of packed elements, we study SPDs and explore situations in which an SPD is a semirigid GCD domain.
