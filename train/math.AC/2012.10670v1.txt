Let M and N be finitely generated graded modules over a graded complete intersection R such that \operatorname{Ext}_R^i(M,N) has finite length for all i\gg 0. We show that the even and odd Hilbert polynomials, which give the lengths of \operatorname{Ext}^i_R(M,N) for all large even i and all large odd i, have the same degree and leading coefficient whenever the highest degree of these polynomials is at least the dimension of M or N. Refinements of this result are given when R is regular in small codimensions.
