We derive polynomial identities of arbitrary degree n for syzygies degrees of numerical semigroups S_m=<d_1,...,d_m> and show that for n>=m they contain higher genera G_r=\sum_{s\in Z_>\setminus S_m}s^r of S_m. We find a number g_m=B_m-m+1 of algebraically independent genera G_r and equations, related any of g_m+1 genera, where B_m=\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\beta_k and \beta_k denote the total and partial Betti numbers of non-symmetric semigroups. The number g_m is strongly dependent on symmetry of S_m and decreases for symmetric semigroups and complete intersections.
