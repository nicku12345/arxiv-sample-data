Let R be a polynomial ring over a field and M= \bigoplus_n M_n a finitely generated graded R-module, minimally generated by homogeneous elements of degree zero with a graded R-minimal free resolution \mathbf{F}. A Cohen-Macaulay module M is Gorenstein when the graded resolution is symmetric. We give an upper bound for the first Hilbert coefficient, e_1 in terms of the shifts in the graded resolution of M. When M = R/I, a Gorenstein algebra, this bound agrees with the bound obtained in \cite{ES} in Gorenstein algebras with quasi-pure resolution. We conjecture a similar bound for the higher coefficients.
