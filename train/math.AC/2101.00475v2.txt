Let (R,\frak m) be a Noetherian local ring of prime characteristic p>0, and t an integer such that H_{\frak m}^j(R)/0^F_{H^j_{\frak m}(R)} has finite length for all j<t. The aim of this paper is to show that there exists an uniform bound for Frobenius test exponents of ideals generated by filter regular sequences of length at most t.
