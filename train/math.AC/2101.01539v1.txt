Let G be a group with identity e and R be a G-graded commutative ring with nonzero unity 1. In this article, we introduce the concept of graded strongly 1-absorbing primary ideals. A proper graded ideal P of R is said to be a graded strongly 1-absorbing primary ideal of R if whenever nonunit homogeneous elements x, y, z\in R such that xyz\in P, then either xy\in P or z\in Grad(\{0\}) (the graded radical of \{0\}). Several properties of graded strongly 1-absorbing primary ideals are investigated. Many results are given to disclose the relations between this new concept and others that already exist. Namely, the graded prime ideals, the graded primary ideals, and the graded 1-absorbing primary ideals.
