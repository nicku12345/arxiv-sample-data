In this article a condition is given to detect the containment among thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of a commutative noetherian ring. More precisely, for a commutative noetherian ring R and complexes of R-modules with finitely generated homology M and N, we show N is in the thick subcategory generated by M if and only if the ghost index of N_\mathfrak{p} with respect to M_\mathfrak{p} is finite for each prime \mathfrak{p} of R. To do so, we establish a "converse coghost lemma" for the bounded derived category of a non-negatively graded DG algebra with noetherian homology.
