We determine the defining equations of the Rees algebra and of the special fiber ring of the ideal of maximal minors of a 2\times n sparse matrix. We prove that their initial algebras are ladder determinantal rings. This allows us to show that the Rees algebra and the special fiber ring are Cohen-Macaulay domains, they are Koszul, they have rational singularities in characteristic zero and are F-rational in positive characteristic.
