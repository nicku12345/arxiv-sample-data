In this paper, we introduce a concept of \mathfrak{X}-element with respect to an M-closed set \mathfrak{X} in multiplicative lattices and study properties of \mathfrak{X}-elements. For a particular M-closed subset \mathfrak{X}, we define the concept of r-element, n-element and J-element. These elements generalize the notion of r-ideals, n-ideals and J-ideals of a commutative ring with unity to multiplicative lattices. In fact, we prove that an ideal I of a commutative ring R with unity is a n-ideal (J-ideal) of R if and only if it is an n-element (J-element) of Id(R), the ideal lattice of R.
