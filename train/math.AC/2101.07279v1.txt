A determinantal facet ideal (DFI) is an ideal J_\Delta generated by maximal minors of a generic matrix parametrized by an associated simplicial complex \Delta. In this paper, we construct an explicit linear strand for the initial ideal with respect to any diagonal term order < of an arbitrary DFI. In particular, we show that if \Delta has no \emph{1-nonfaces}, then the Betti numbers of the linear strand of J_\Delta and its initial ideal coincide. We apply this result to prove a conjecture of Ene, Herzog, and Hibi on Betti numbers of closed binomial edge ideals in the case that the associated graph has at most 2 maximal cliques. More generally, we show that the linear strand of the initial ideal (with respect to <) of \emph{any} DFI is supported on a polyhedral cell complex obtained as an induced subcomplex of the \emph{complex of boxes}, introduced by Nagel and Reiner.
