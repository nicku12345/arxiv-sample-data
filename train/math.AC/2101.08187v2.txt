We search some splitting (resp. finiteness) criteria by applying certain splitting (resp. finiteness) property of the cohomological functors. We present a connection from our approach to the realization problem of Nunke. This equipped with several applications. For instance, we recover some results of Jensen (and others) by applying simple methods. Additional applications include a computation of some numerical invariants such as the projective dimension of some injective modules and et cetera.
