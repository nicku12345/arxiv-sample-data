Recently, nearly complete intersection ideals were defined by Boocher and Seiner to establish lower bounds on Betti numbers for monomial ideals (arXiv:1706.09866). Stone and Miller then characterized nearly complete intersections using the theory of edge ideals (arXiv:2101.07901). We extend their work to fully characterize nearly complete intersections of arbitrary generating degrees and use this characterization to compute minimal free resolutions of nearly complete intersections from their degree 2 part.
