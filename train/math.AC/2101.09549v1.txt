Let G be a group with identity e. Let R be a G-graded commutative ring with identity and M a graded R-module. In this paper, we introduce the concept of graded I_{e}-prime submodule as a generalization of a graded prime submodule for I=\oplus_{g\in G}I_{g} a fixed graded ideal of R. We give a number of results concerning of these classes of graded submodules and their homogeneous components. A proper graded submodule N of M is said to be a graded I_{e}-prime submodule of M if whenever % r_{g}\in h(R) and m_{h}\in h(M) with r_{g}m_{h}\in N-I_{e}N, then either r_{g}\in (N:_{R}M) or m_{h}\in N.
