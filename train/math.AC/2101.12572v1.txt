Let G be a group with identity e. Let R be a G-graded commutative ring and M a graded R-module. A proper graded submodule N of M is called \textit{a graded semiprime submodule} if whenever r\in h(R), m\in h(M) and n\in Z^{+} with r^{n}m\in N, then rm\in N. In this paper, we introduce the concept of graded quasi-semiprime submodule as a generalization of graded semiprime submodule and show a number of results in this class. We say that a proper graded submodule N of M is \emph{a graded quasi-semiprime submodule} if (N:_{R}M) is a graded semiprime ideal of R.
