If (X, \le_X) is a partially ordered set satisfying certain necessary conditions for X to be order-isomorphic to the spectrum of a Noetherian domain of dimension two, we describe a new poset (\text{str } X, \le_{\text{str } X}) that completely determines X up to isomorphism. The order relation \le_{\text{str } X} imposed on \text{str } X is modeled after R. Wiegand's well-known "P5" condition that can be used to determine when a given partially ordered set (U, \le_U) of a certain type is order-isomorphic to (\text{Spec } \mathbb Z[x], \subseteq).
