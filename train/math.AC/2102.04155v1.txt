Let R be a graded commutative ring with non-zero unity 1 and M be a graded unitary R-module. Let GS(M) be the set of all graded R-submodules of M and \phi: GS(M)\rightarrow GS(M)\bigcup\{\emptyset\} be a function. A proper graded R-submodule K of M is said to be a graded \phi-prime R-submodule of M if whenever r is a homogeneous element of R and m is a homogeneous element of M such that rm\in K-\phi(K), then either m\in K or r\in (K:_{R}M). If \phi(K)=\emptyset for all K\in GS(M), then a graded \phi-prime submodule is exactly a graded prime submodule. If \phi(K)=\{0\} for all K\in GS(M), then a graded \phi-prime submodule is exactly a graded weakly prime submodule. Several properties of graded \phi-prime submodules have been investigated.
