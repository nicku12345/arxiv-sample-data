Let A be a Noetherian local ring with the maximal ideal \mathfrak{m} and I be an \mathfrak{m}-primary ideal in A. In this paper, we study a boundary condition of an inequality on Hilbert coefficients of an I-admissible filtration \mathcal{I}. When A is a Buchsbaum local ring, the above equality forces Buchsbaumness on the associated graded ring of filtration. Our result provides a positive resolution of a question of Corso in a general set up of filtration.
