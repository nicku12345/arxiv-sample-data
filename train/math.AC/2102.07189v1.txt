Let R be a commutative ring with nonzero identity. Let \mathcal{I}(R) be the set of all ideals of R and let \delta : \mathcal{I}(R)\longrightarrow \mathcal{I}(R) be a function. Then \delta is called an expansion function of ideals of R if whenever L, I, J are ideals of R with J \subseteq I, we have L \subseteq \delta( L) and \delta(J)\subseteq \delta(I). Let \delta be an expansion function of ideals of R. In this paper, we introduce and investigate a new class of ideals that is closely related to the class of \delta-primary ideals. A proper ideal I of R is said to be a 1-absorbing \delta-primary ideal if whenever nonunit elements a,b,c \in R  and abc\in I, then ab \in I or c\in \delta(I). Moreover, we give some basic properties of this class of ideals and we study the 1-absorbing \delta-primary ideals of the localization of rings, the direct product of rings and the trivial ring extensions.
