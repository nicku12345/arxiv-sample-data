Let R=\oplus_{n\in \N_0}R_n be a standard graded ring, M be a finitely generated graded R-module and R_+:=\oplus_{n\in \N}R_n denotes the irrelevant ideal of R. In this paper, considering the new concept of linkage of ideals over a module, we study the graded components H^i_{\fa}(M)_n when \fa is an h-linked ideal over M. More precisely, we show that H^i_{\fa}(M) is tame in each of the following cases: \begin{itemize}   \item [(i)] i=f_{\fa}^{R_+}(M), the first integer i for which R_+\nsubseteq \sqrt{0:H^i_{\fa}(M)};   \item [(ii)] i=\cd(R_+,M), the last integer i for which H^{i}_{R_+}(M)\neq 0, and \fa=\fb+R_+ where \fb is an h-linked ideal with R_+ over M. \end{itemize} Also, among other things, we describe the components H^i_{\fa}(M)_n where \fa is radically h-M-licci with respect to R_+ of length 2.
