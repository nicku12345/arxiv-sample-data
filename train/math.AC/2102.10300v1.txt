Let R be a commutative ring with identity and M be a unitary R-module. The aim of this paper is to extend the notion of quasi J-ideals of commutative rings to quasi J-submodules of modules. We call a proper submodule N of M a quasi J-submodule if whenever r\in R and m\in M such that rm\in N and r\notin(J(R)M:M), then m\in M-rad(N). We present various properties and characterizations of this concept (especially in finitely generated faithful multiplication modules). Furthermore, we provide new classes of modules generalizing presimplifiable modules and justify their relation with (quasi) J-submodules. Finally, for a submodule N of M and an ideal I of R, we characterize the quasi J-ideals of the idealization ring R(+)M.
