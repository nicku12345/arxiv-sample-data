Let R be a commutative ring with non-zero identity and M be a unitary R-module. The goal of this paper is to extend the concept of 1-absorbing primary ideals to 1-absorbing primary submodules. A proper submodule N of M is said to be a 1-absorbing primary submodule if whenever non-unit elements a,b\in R and m\in M with abm\in N, then either ab\in(N:_{R}M) or m\in M-rad(N). Various properties and chacterizations of this class of submodules are considered. Moreover, 1-absorbing primary avoidance theorem is proved.
