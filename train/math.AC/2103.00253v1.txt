If M is a nonzero finitely generated module over a commutative Noetherian local ring R such that M has finite injective dimension and finite Gorenstein dimension, then it follows from a result of Holm that M has finite projective dimension, and hence a result of Foxby implies that R is Gorenstein. We investigate whether the same conclusion holds for nonzero finitely generated modules that have finite injective dimension and finite reducing Gorenstein dimension, where the reducing Gorenstein dimension is a finer invariant than the classical Gorenstein dimension, in general.
