Let A be a Noetherian flat K[t]-algebra, h an integer and let N be a graded K[t]-module, we introduce and study "N-fiber-full up to h" A-modules. We prove that an A-module M is N-fiber-full up to h if and only if \mathrm{Ext}^i_A(M, N) is flat over K[t] for all i\le h-1. And we show some applications of this result extending the recent result on squarefree Gr\"obner degenerations by Conca and Varbaro.
