We develop the parallel theories of Ohm-Rush and intersection flat algebras. In an Ohm-Rush algebra extension of ideals commutes with arbitrary intersection, whereas in an intersection-flat algebra extension of submodules of a finite module commutes with arbitrary intersection. We show that both properties can be checked locally in flat maps of Noetherian rings. We show that intersection-flatness admits a content theory parallel to that of Ohm-Rush content for Ohm-Rush algebras. We develop ascent and descent results for these properties. Using the descent result, we obtain a local condition under which a faithfully flat map of Noetherian rings must be intersection-flat. The local condition for intersection-flatness allows us to conclude that finitely generated faithfully flat algebras over a Noetherian ring are intersection-flat. Combining the local condition for intersection flatness with results of Kunz and Radu yields the conclusion that the Frobenius endomorphism associated to a Noetherian regular G-ring of prime characteristic is intersection-flat, thus answering a quesion of Sharp. We exhibit applications of the latter result to test elements, tight closure, Hartshorne-Speiser-Lyubeznik numbers, parameter test ideals, and F-jumping numbers, broadening existing results in the literature to a much wider class of rings. In particular, we show that reduced quotients of locally excellent regular Noetherian characteristic p rings admit big test elements, and that the set of F-jumping numbers of a principal ideal in an excellent regular ring is a discrete subset of \mathbb Q.
