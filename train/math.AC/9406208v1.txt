Assume R is a polynomial ring over a field and I is a homogeneous Gorenstein ideal of codimension g\ge3 and initial degree p\ge2. We prove that the number of minimal generators \nu(I_p) of I that are in degree p is bounded above by \nu_0={p+g-1\choose g-1}-{p+g-3\choose g-1}, which is the number of minimal generators of the defining ideal of the extremal Gorenstein algebra of codimension g and initial degree p. Further, I is itself extremal if \nu(I_p)=\nu_0.
