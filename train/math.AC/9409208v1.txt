Let R=\bigoplus_{n\ges0}R_n be a graded commutative ring generated over a field K=R_0 by homogeneous elements x_1,\dots,x_e of positive degrees d_1,\dots,d_e. The Hilbert-Serre Theorem shows that for each finite graded R--module M=\bigoplus_{n\in\BZ}M_n the {\it Hilbert series\/} \sum_{n\in\BZ}(\rank_K M_n)t^n is the Laurent expansion around 0 of a rational function    H_M(t)=\frac{q_M(t)}{\prod_{i=1}^e(1-t^{d_i})}    with q_M(t)\in\BZ[t,\ti]. We demonstrate that Laurent expansions \left[M\right]_z of H_M(t) around other points z of the extended complex plane \overline\BC also carry important structural information.
