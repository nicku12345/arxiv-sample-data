In this paper we give an effective characterization of Hilbert functions and polynomials of standard algebras over an Artinian equicharacteristic local ring; the cohomological properties of such algebras are also studied. We describe algorithms to check the admissibility of a given function or polynomial as a Hilbert function or polynomial, and to produce a standard algebra with a given Hilbert function.
