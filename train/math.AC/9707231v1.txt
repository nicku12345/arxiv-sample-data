The class of all Artinian local rings of length at most l is A_2-elementary, axiomatised by a finite set of axioms Art_l. We show that its existentially closed models are Gorenstein, of length exactly l and their residue fields are algebraically closed, and, conversely, every existentially closed model is of this form. The theory Gor_l of all Artinian local Gorenstein rings of length l with algebraically closed residue field is model complete and the theory Art_l is companionable, with model-companion Gor_l.
