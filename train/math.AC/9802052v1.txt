We construct explicitly regular sequences in the semigroup ring R=\CC[K] of lattice points of the graded cone K. We conjecture that the quotients of R by these sequences describe locally string-theoretic cohomology of a toroidal singularity associated to K. As a byproduct, we give an elementary proof of the result of Hochster that semigroup rings of rational polyhedral cones are Cohen-Macaulay.
