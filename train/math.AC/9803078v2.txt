Suppose that X to Y is a generically finite map of nonsingular varieties over a field of characteristic zero, and v is a valuation of the function field of X. We prove that it is possible to perform a sequence of monoidal transforms X' to X and Y' to Y so that X' to Y' is a monomial mapping at the center of v. We deduce from this that a birational morphism of nonsingular varieties can be factored along a valuation by a sequence of blowups and blowdowns with nonsingular centers.
