Let G be a nontrivial finite subgroup of \SL_n(\C). Suppose that the quotient singularity \C^n/G has a crepant resolution \pi\colon X\to \C^n/G (i.e. K_X = \shfO_X). There is a slightly imprecise conjecture, called the McKay correspondence, stating that there is a relation between the Grothendieck group (or (co)homology group) of X and the representations (or conjugacy classes) of G with a ``certain compatibility'' between the intersection product and the tensor product (see e.g. \cite{Maizuru}). The purpose of this paper is to give more precise formulation of the conjecture when X can be given as a certain variety associated with the Hilbert scheme of points in \C^n. We give the proof of this new conjecture for an abelian subgroup G of \SL_3(\C).
