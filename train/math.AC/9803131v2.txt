Let F be a line bundle on the blow-up X of P^2 at r general points p_1, ..., p_r and let L be the pullback to X of the line bundle coming from a line on P^2. Under reasonable hypotheses that are conjectured always to hold if the points p_1, ..., p_r are sufficiently general, it is shown that the computation of the dimension of the cokernel of the natural map \mu_F:\Gamma(F)\otimes\Gamma(L)\to\Gamma(F\otimes L) reduces to the case that F is ample. As an application, a complete determination of the dimension of the cokernel of \mu_F is obtained when r\le 7, thereby solving the Ideal Generation Problem for fat point subschemes involving up to 7 general points of the plane and giving an algorithm depending only on the multiplicities m_i for determining the modules in a minimal free resolution of the ideal defining a fat point subscheme m_1p_1+...+ m_7p_7 for general points p_i. All results hold for an arbitrary algebraically closed ground field k.
