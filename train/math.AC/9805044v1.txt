We study the difference between the lengths of the torsion of the differential modules of the local ring R of an algebroid curve and its first quadratic transform. The conjecture is that this difference should be positive if R is not regular. This is shown to be true in some cases, especially for stable complete intersections and for semigroup rings which are complete intersections.
