The principal result is a primary decomposition of ideals generated by the (2x2)-subpermanents of a generic matrix. These permanental ideals almost always have embedded components and their minimal primes are of three distinct heights. Thus the permanental ideals are almost never Cohen-Macaulay, in contrast with determinantal ideals.
