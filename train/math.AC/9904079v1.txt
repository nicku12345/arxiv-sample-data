Let V be a finite dimensional complex superspace and G a simple (or a ``close'' to simple) Lie superalgebra of matrix type, i.e., a Lie subsuperalgebra in GL(V). Under the classical invariant theory for G we mean the description of G-invariant elements of the tensor algebra of V. In math.RT/9810113 the invariants are described up to polarization operators. Here we give a complete description of the generators in the algebra of invariants and describe the relations between the invariants of the scalar product type.
