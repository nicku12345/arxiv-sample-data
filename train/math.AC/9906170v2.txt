We show that a Gorenstein subcanonical codimension 3 subscheme Z in X = P^N, N > 3, can be realized as the locus along which two Lagrangian subbundles of a twisted orthogonal bundle meet degenerately, and conversely. We extend this result to singular Z and all quasiprojective ambient schemes X under the necessary hypothesis that Z is strongly subcanonical in a sense defined below. A central point is that a pair of Lagrangian subbundles can be transformed locally into an alternating map. In the local case our structure theorem reduces to that of Buchsbaum-Eisenbud and says that Z is Pfaffian.   We also prove codimension one symmetric and skew-symmetric analogues of our structure theorems.
