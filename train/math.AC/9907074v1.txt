We define very proper intersections of modules and projective subschemes. It turns out that equidimensional locally Cohen-Macaulay modules intersect very properly if and only if they intersect properly. We prove a Bezout theorem for modules which meet very properly. Furthermore, we show for equidimensional subschemes X and Y: If they intersect properly in an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay subscheme of positive dimension then X and Y are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. The module version of this result implies splitting criteria for reflexive sheaves.
