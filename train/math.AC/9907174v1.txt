The representations of dimension vector \alpha of the quiver Q can be parametrised by a vector space R(Q,\alpha) on which an algebraic group \Gl(\alpha) acts so that the set of orbits is bijective with the set of isomorphism classes of representations of the quiver. We describe the semi--invariant polynomial functions on this vector space in terms of the category of representations. More precisely, we associate to a suitable map between projective representations a semi-invariant polynomial function that describes when this map is inverted on the representation and we show that these semi-invariant polynomial functions form a spanning set of all semi-invariant polynomial functions in characteristic 0. If the quiver has no oriented cycles, we may replace consideration of inverting maps between projective representations by consideration of representations that are left perpendicular to some representation of dimension vector \alpha. These left perpendicular representations are just the cokernels of the maps between projective representations that we consider.
