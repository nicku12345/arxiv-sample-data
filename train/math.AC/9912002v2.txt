Assume that there exists a hypersurface singularity which cannot be resolved by iterated monoidal transformations in positive characteristic. We show that in the set of defining functions of hypersurface singularities which cannot be resolved, we can find a function satisfying very strong conditions. By these conditions we may be able to deduce a contradiction under the above assumption. Besides, we introduce fundamental concepts for the study of resolution of singularities of germs such as space germs, iterated analytic monoidal transforms with a normal crossing, Weierstrass representations, reduction sequences, and so forth. This is a revised version of a part of contents of my previous manuscript "Resolution of Singularities of Germs in Characteristic Positive associated with Valuation Rings of Iterated Divisor Type" at math.AG/9901048.
