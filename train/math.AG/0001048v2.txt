The main result of this paper is the proof of the "transversal part" of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture for an elliptic curve which states an equivalence of two A_{\infty}-structures on the category of vector bundles on an elliptic curves. The proof is based on the study of A_{\infty}-structures on the category of line bundles over an elliptic curve satisfying some natural restrictions (in particular, m_1 should be zero, m_2 should coincide with the usual composition). The key observation is that such a structure is uniquely determined up to homotopy by certain triple products.
