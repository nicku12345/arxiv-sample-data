We verify a special case of V. V. Shokurov's conjecture about characterization of toric varieties. More precisely, let (X,D=\sum d_iD_i) be a three-dimensional log variety such that K_X+D is numerically trivial and (X,D) has only purely log terminal singularities. In this situation we prove the inequality \{center} \sum d_i\le \rk\Weil(X)/(\operatorname{algebraic equivalence}) +\dim(X). \{center} We describe such pairs for which the equality holds and show that all of them are toric.
