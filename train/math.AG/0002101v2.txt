For a semistable reflexive sheaf E of rank r and c_1=a on \P^n and an integer d such that r|ad, we give sufficient conditions so that the restriction of E on a generic rational curve of degree d is balanced, i.e. a twist of the trivial bundle (for instance, if E has balanced restriction on a generic line, or r=2 or E is an exterior power of the tangent bundle). Assuming this, we give a formula for the 'virtual degree', interpreted enumeratively, of the locus of rational curves of degree d on which the restriction of E is not balanced, generalizing a classical formula due to Barth for the degree of the divisor of jumping lines of a semistable rank-2 bundle.
