Ran proved that smooth codimension 2 varieties in {\bf P}^{m+2} are j-normal if (j+1)(3j-1)\le m-1, in this paper we extend this result to small codimension projective varieties. Let X be a r codimension subvariety of \pro, we prove that if the set \Sigma_{(j+1)} of (j+1)-secants to X through a generic external point is not empty, 2(r+1)j\leq m-r and (j+1)((r+1)j-1)\leq m-1 then X is j-normal. If X is given by the zero locus of a section of a rank r vector bundle E on \pro, we prove that \textrm{deg} \Sigma_{j+1}=\frac{1}{(j+1)!}\prod_{i=0}^{j}c_{r}(E(-i)). Moreover we get a new simple proof of Zak's theorem on linear normality if m\ge 3r. Finally we prove that if c_{r}(N(-2))\neq 0 and 6r\le m-4 then X is 2-normal.
