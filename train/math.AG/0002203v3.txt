Let Y be a projective non-singular curve of genus g, X a projective manifold, both defined over the field of complex numbers, and let f:X ---> Y be a surjective morphism with general fibre F.   If the Kodaira dimension of X is non-negative, and if Y is the projective line we show that f has at least 3 singular fibres.   In general, for non-isotrivial morphisms f, one expects that the number of singular fibres is at least 3, if g=0, or at least 1, if g=1. Using the strong additivity of the Kodaira dimension, this is verified, if either F is of general type, or if F has a minimal model with a semi-ample canonical divisor. The corresponding result has been obtained by Migliorini and Kovacs, for families of surfaces of general type and for families of canonically polarized manifolds, and by Oguiso-Viehweg for families of elliptic surfaces.   As a byproduct we obtain explicit bounds for the degree of the direct image of powers of the dualizing sheaf, generalizing those obtained by Bedulev-Viehweg for families of surfaces of general type.
