In 1932 F. Severi claimed, with an incorrect proof, that every smooth minimal projective surface S such that the bundle \Omega^1_S is generically generated by global sections satisfies the topological inequality 2c_1^2(S)\ge c_2(S). According to Enriques-Kodaira classification, the above inequality is easily verified when the Kodaira dimension of the surface is \le 1, while for surfaces of general type it is still an open problem known as Severi conjecture. In this paper we prove Severi conjecture under the additional mild hypothesis that S has ample canonical bundle. Moreover, under the same assumption, we prove that 2c_1^2(S)=c_2(S) if and only if S is a double cover of an abelian surface.
