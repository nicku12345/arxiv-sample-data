Let {\rm F} be a rank-2 semi-stable sheaf on the projective plane, with Chern classes c_{1}=0,c_{2}=n. The curve \beta_{\rm F} of jumping lines of {\rm F}, in the dual projective plane, has degree n. Let {\rm M}_{n} be the moduli space of equivalence classes of semi-stables sheaves of rank 2 and Chern classes (0,n) on the projective plane and {\cal C}_{n} be the projective space of curves of degree n in the dual projective plane. The Barth morphism \beta: {\rm M}_{n}\longrightarrow{\cal C}_{n} associates the point \beta_{\rm F} to the class of the sheaf {\rm F}. We prove that this morphism is generically injective for n\geq 4. The image of \beta is a closed subvariety of dimension 4n-3 of {\cal C}_{n}; as a consequence of our result, the degree of this image is given by the Donaldson number of index 4n-3 of the projective plane.
