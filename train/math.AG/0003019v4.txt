The article has two parts. The first part is devoted to proving a singular version of the logarithmic Kodaira-Akizuki-Nakano vanishing theorem of Esnault and Viehweg. This is then used to prove other vanishing theorems. In the second part these vanishing theorems are used to prove an Arakelov-Parshin type boundedness result for families of canonically polarized varieties with rational Gorenstein singularities.
