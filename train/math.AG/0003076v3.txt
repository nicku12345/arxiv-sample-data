We apply the homological mirror symmetry for elliptic curves to the study of indefinite theta series. We prove that every such series corresponding to a quadratic form of signature (1,1) can be expressed in terms of theta series associated with split quadratic forms and the usual theta series. We also show that indefinite theta series corresponding to univalued Massey products between line bundles on elliptic curve are modular.
