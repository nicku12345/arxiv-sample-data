Let X be a smooth hypersurface of degree n\geq 3 in \mathbb{P}^n. We prove that the log canonical threshold of H\in|-K_X| is at least \frac{n-1}{n}. Under the assumption of the Log minimal model program, we also prove that a hyperplane section H of X is a cone in \mathbb{P}^{n-1} over a smooth hypersurface of degree n in \mathbb{P}^{n-2} if and only if the log canonical threshold of H is \frac{n-1}{n}.
