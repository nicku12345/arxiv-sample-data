Let R be a Dedekind scheme, \nu its generic point, X and V del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 over R that are Gorenstein Mori fiber spaces (as 3-folds germs over the ground field). We study birational maps \phi:X\dasharrow V over R which are isomorphisms over the generic point of R. We put down normal forms of such transformations (in suitable coordinates) and give some properties of X and V. In particular, we prove the uniqueness of a smooth model.
