We prove the connectedness of the moduli space of maps (of fixed genus and homology class) to the homogeneous space G/P by degeneration via the maximal torus action. In the genus 0 case, the irreducibility of the moduli of maps is a direct consequence of connectedness. An analysis of a related Bialynicki-Birula stratification of the map space yields a rationality result: the (coarse) moduli space of genus 0 maps to G/P is a rational variety. The rationality argument depends essentially upon rationality results for quotients of SL2 representations proven by Katsylo and Bogomolov.
