In this paper we prove that Arnold Surfaces of all real algebraic curves of even degree with non-empty real part are standard (Rokhlin's Conjecture). There is an obvious connection with classification of Arnold Surfaces up to isotopy of S^4 and Hilbert's Sixteen Problem on the arrangements of connected real components of curves. First, we consider some M-curves, i.e curves of a prescribed degree having the greatest possible number of connected real components, and prove that Arnold surfaces of these curves are standard. Afterwards, we exhibit a procedure of modification "perestroika" of these M-curves which allows to prove the Rokhlin's Conjecture.
