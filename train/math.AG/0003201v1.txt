In their article [1], L. Gruson and M. Skiti have constructed a birationnal map from the variety \I of mathematical instantons of degree 3 to the variety of nets of quadrics in \pd. They describe by this way two irreducible componants of the boundary of \I associated to the divisor of nets which contain a two-plane degenerated quadric and the divisor of L\" uroth nets. In this article we describe an irreducible componante of the boundary of \I as the exceptionnal divisor of the blowing-up of the closed set of nets of quadrics of rank 3.
