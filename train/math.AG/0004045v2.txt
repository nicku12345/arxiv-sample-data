In this paper we generalized the variational formulas for the determinants of the Laplacians on functions of CY metrics to forms of type (0,q) on CY manifolds. We also computed the Ray Singer Analytic torsion on CY manifolds we proved that it is bounded by a constant. In case of even dimensional CY manifolds the Ray Singer Analytic torsion is zero. The interesting case is the odd dimensional one.
