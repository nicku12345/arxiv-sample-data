Let (X,\Delta) be a 4-dimensional log variety which is proper over the field of complex numbers and with only divisorial log terminal singularities. The log canonical divisor K_X+\Delta is semi-ample, if it is nef (numerically effective) and the Iitaka dimension \kappa(X,K_X+\Delta) is strictly positive. For the proof, we use Fujino's abundance theorem for semi log canonical threefolds.
