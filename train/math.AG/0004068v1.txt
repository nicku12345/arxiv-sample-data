We compute the dimensions of spaces of sections of all powers of the Donaldson determinant bundle on the moduli space of rank 2 semi-stable sheaves on the projective plane, with zero first Chern class, and second Chern class equal to 3 or 4. We prove Le Potier's strange duality conjecture in some cases.
