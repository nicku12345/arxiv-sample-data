We give the multiplicity of terminal singularities on threefolds by simple calculation. Then we obtain the best inequalities for the multiplicity and the index. By using this, we can improve the boundedness number of terminal weak Q-Fano 3-folds in [KMMT, Theorem 1.2]. Furthermore, we can extended [K, Theorem 3.6] for Fujita freeness conditions to nonhypersurface terminal singularities.
