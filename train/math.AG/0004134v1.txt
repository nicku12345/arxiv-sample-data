The survey gives an overview of the achievements in topology of real algebraic varieties in the direction initiated in the early 70th by V.I.Arnold and V.A.Rokhlin. We make an attempt to systematize the principal results in the subject. After an exposition of general tools and results, special attention is paid to surfaces and curves on surfaces.
