Let X\subset Y be smooth, projective manifolds. Assume that X is the zero locus of a generic section of a direct sum V+ of positive line bundles on \PP^n. Furthermore assume that the normal bundle N_{X/Y} is a direct sum V- of negative line bundles. We show that a V:=V+\oplus V--twisted Gromov-Witten theory of \PP^n restricts to the Gromov-Witten theory of X inherited form Y. The later one can be computed via a Mirror Theorem which we prove in this paper.
