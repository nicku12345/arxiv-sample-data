We study Mirror Symmetry of log Calabi-Yau surfaces. On one hand, we consider the number of ``affine lines'' of each degree in the complement of a smooth cubic in the projective plane. On the other hand, we consider coefficients of a certain expansion of a function obtained from the integrals of dxdy/xy over 2-chains whose boundaries lie on B_\phi where {B_\phi} is a family of smooth cubics. Then, for small degrees, they coincide.   We discuss the relation between this phenomenon and local mirror symmetry for projective plane in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold by Chiang-Klemm-Yau-Zaslow.
