We study the deformations of a holomorphic symplectic manifold M, not necessarily compact, over a formal ring. We show (under some additional, but mild, assumptions on M) that the coarse deformation space exists and is smooth, finite-dimensional and naturally embedded into H^2(M). For a holomorphic symplectic manifold M which satisfies H^1(M,{\cal O}_M) = H^2(M,{\cal O}_M)=0, the coarse moduli of formal deformations is isomorphic to \Spec\C[[t_1, ..., t_n]], where t_1, ... t_n are coordinates in H^2(M).   This revised version contains one minor improvement: exposition in Subsection 5.1 has been made more detailed and rigourous.
