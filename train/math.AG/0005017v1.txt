Let X be a smooth cubic threefold, M the moduli space of stable rank 2 vector bundles on X with trivial determinant and c_2=2 (the smallest value for which this space is non-empty). Recent results of Druel, Iliev, Markushevich and Tikhomirov lead to a precise description of M and its Maruyama compactification M': the latter is isomorphic to the intermediate Jacobian of X blown-up along the Fano surface. In this survey paper we explain these results and discuss some applications.
