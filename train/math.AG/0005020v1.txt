It was proved by Ginzburg and Mirkovic-Vilonen that the G(O)-equivariant perverse sheaves on the affine grassmannian of a connected reductive group G form a tensor category equivalent to the tensor category of finite dimensional representations of the dual group G^\vee. The proof use the Tannakian formalism. The purpose of this paper is to construct explicitely the action of G^\vee on the global cohomology of a perverse sheaf.
