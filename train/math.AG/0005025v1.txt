Let G be a semi-simple algebraic group over {\mathbb C}, B a Borel subgroup of G and T a maximal torus in B. A beautiful unpublished result of Dale Peterson says that if G is simply laced, then every rationally smooth point of a Schubert variety X in G/B is nonsingular in X. The purpose of this paper is to generalize this result to arbitrary T-stable subvarieties of G/B, the only restriction being that G contains no G_2 factors. In particular, we show that a Schubert variety X in such a G/B is nonsingular if and only if all the reduced tangent cones of X are linear.
