Let X be an ordinary smooth curve defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. The absolute Frobenius induces a rational map F on the moduli space M_X of rank 2 vector bundles with fixed trivial determinant. If the genus of X is 2, the moduli space M_X is isomorphic to projective space of dimension 3 (as over the complex numbers). In this case we explicitly give the equations of F, which enables us to determine, for example, its base locus (one point) and its image (different from M_X).
