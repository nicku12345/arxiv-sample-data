Among solutions of n-Gelfand-Dikii's hierarchy there exists a remarkable solution W, which satisfies the string equation. We call it Witten's solution because according to the Witten conjecture the function F(x_1, x_2, x_3,...) = W(x_1,(x_2)/2, (x_3)/3,...) is the generating function for intersection nambers of Mumford-Morita-Muller cohomological classes of the moduli space of n-spin Riemann surfaces. This conjecture was proved by Kontsevich for n=2 and by Witten himself for surfaces of genus 0.   In this paper we find recurrence relations between coefficients of Taylor series of W. This reduces the Witten's conjecture to conjecture that the Mamford-Morita-Muller numbers satisfy to the same relations. These relations give also an algorithm for calculation of n-spin Mamford-Morita-Muller numbers in assuming that the Witten conjecture is true. Moreover we prove that F(x_1,x_2,...,x_{n-1},0,0,...)= W(x_1, (x_2)/2,...,(x_{n-1})/(n-1),0,0,...).
