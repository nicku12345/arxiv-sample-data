The paper consists of two sections. The first section provides a new definition of mirror symmetry of abelian varieties making sense also over p-adic fields. The second section introduces and studies quantized theta-functions with two-sided multipliers, which are functions on non-commutative tori. This is an extension of an earlier work by the author. In the Introduction and in the Appendix the constructions of this paper are put into a wider context.
