We study the degeneracy loci of general bundle morphisms from the direct sum of m copies of the structural sheaf on P^n to \Omega(2), also from the point of view of the classical geometrical interpretation of the sections of \Omega(2) as linear line complexes. We consider in particular the case of P^5 with m=2, 3. For n=5 and m=3 we give an explicit description of the Hilbert scheme H of elliptic normal scrolls in P^5, by defining a natural rational map from the Grassmannian G(2,14) to H, which results to be dominant with general fibre of degree four.
