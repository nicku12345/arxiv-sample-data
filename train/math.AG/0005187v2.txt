Let X be a smooth complex projective algebraic variety of maximal Albanese dimension. We give a characterization of \kappa (X) in terms of the set V^0(X,\omega_{X}) :=\{P\in {\text{\rm Pic}}^0(X)|h^0(X, \omega_X \otimes P) \ne 0\}. An immediate consequence of this is that the Kodaira dimension \kappa (X) is invariant under smooth deformations. We then study the pluricanonical maps \phi_m:X -> \Bbb{P} (H^0(X,mK_X)). We prove that if X is of general type, \phi_m is generically finite for m\geq 5 and birational for m\geq 5 \text{\rm dim} (X) +1. More generally, we show that for m\geq 6 the image of \phi_m is of dimension equal to \kappa (X) and for m\geq 6\kappa (X)+2, \phi_m is the stable canonical map.
