A scheme of computing \chi(\mbar_{1,n}, L_1^{\otimes d_1}\otimes ... \otimes L_n^{\otimes d_n}) is given. Here \mbar_{1,n} is the moduli space of n-pointed stable curves of genus one and L_i are the universal cotangent line bundles defined by x_i^*(\omega_{C/M}), where C \to \mbar_{1,n} is the universal curve, \omega_{C/M} the relative dualizing sheaf and x_i the marked point. This work is a sequel to \cite{YL1}.
