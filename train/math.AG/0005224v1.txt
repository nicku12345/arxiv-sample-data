We introduce a category of extended complex manifolds, and prove that the functor describing deformations of a classical compact complex manifold M within this category is versally representable by (an analytic subspace in) H^*(M,T_M). By restricting the associated versal family of extended complex manifolds over H^*(M,T_M) to the subspace H^1(M,T_M) one gets a correct limit to the classical picture.
