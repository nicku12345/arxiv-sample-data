Let X be a compact K\"{a}hler manifold, and let L be a line bundle on X. Define I_k(L) to be the kernel of the multiplication map  Sym^k H^0 (L) \to H^0 (L^k). For all h \leq k, we define a map \rho : I_k(L) \to Hom (H^{p,q} (L^{-h}), H^{p+1,q-1} (L^{k-h})). When L = K_X is the canonical bundle, the map \rho computes a second fundamental form associated to the deformations of X. If X=C is a curve, then \rho is a lifting of the Wahl map I_2(L) \to H^0 (L^2 \otimes K_C^2). We also show how to generalize the construction of \rho to the cases of harmonic bundles and of couples of vector bundles.
