This is an erratum to math.AG/9803126, Tohoku 51 (1999) 489-537. This erratum describes:   1. the failure of the algorithm in [AMR] and [Morelli1] for the strong factorization pointed out by Kalle Karu,   2. the statement of a refined weak factorization theorem for toroidal birational morphisms in [AMR], in the form utilized in [AKMR] for the proof of the weak factorization theorem for general birationla maps, avoiding the use of the above mentioned algorithm for the strong factorization, and 3. a list of corrections for a few other mistakes in [AMR], mostly pointed out by Laurent Bonavero.
