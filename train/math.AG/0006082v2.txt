We describe the moduli spaces of morphisms between polarized complex abelian varieties. The discrete invariants, derived from a Poincare' decomposition of morphisms, are the types of polarizations and of lattice homomorphisms occurring in the decomposition. For a given type of morphisms the moduli variety is irreducible, and is obtained from a product of Siegel spaces modulo the action of a discrete group.
