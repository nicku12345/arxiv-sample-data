We study Deligne's conjecture on the monodromy weight filtration on the nearby cycles in the mixed characteristic case, and reduce it to the nondegeneracy of certain pairings in the semistable case. We also prove a related conjecture of Rapoport and Zink which uses only the image of the Cech restriction morphism, if Deligne's conjecture holds for a general hyperplane section. In general we show that Deligne's conjecture is true if the standard conjectures hold.
