This is a sequal paper to math.AG/9909021. By using the theory of AZD originated by the author, I prove that for every smooth projective n-fold X of general type and every \[ m\geq \lceil\sum_{\ell =1}^{n}\sqrt[\ell]{2} \ell\rceil +1, \] \mid mK_{X}\mid gives a birational rational map from X into a projective space, unless it has a nontrivial (relative dimension is positive) rational fiber space structure whose general fiber is birational to a variety of relatively low degree in a projective space.
