The aim of this paper is to get some results about ruled surfaces which configure a projective theory of scrolls and ruled surfaces. Our ideas follow the viewpoint of Corrado Segre, but we employ the contemporaneous language of locally free sheaves. The results complete the exposition given by R. Hartshorne and they have not appeared before in the contemporaneous literature.
