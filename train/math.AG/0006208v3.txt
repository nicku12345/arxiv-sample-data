In this paper we study the ample cone of the moduli space \mgn of stable n-pointed curves of genus g. Our motivating conjecture is that a divisor on \mgn is ample iff it has positive intersection with all 1-dimensional strata (the components of the locus of curves with at least 3g+n-2 nodes). This translates into a simple conjectural description of the cone by linear inequalities, and, as all the 1-strata are rational, includes the conjecture that the Mori cone is polyhedral and generated by rational curves. Our main result is that the conjecture holds iff it holds for g=0. More precisely, there is a natural finite map r: \vmgn 0. 2g+n. \to \mgn whose image is the locus \rgn of curves with all components rational. Any 1-strata either lies in \rgn or is numerically equivalent to a family E of elliptic tails and we show that a divisor D is nef iff D \cdot E \geq 0 and r^*(D) is nef. We also give results on contractions (i.e. morphisms with connected fibers to projective varieties) of \mgn for g \geq 1 showing that any fibration factors through a tautological one (given by forgetting points) and that the exceptional locus of any birational contraction is contained in the boundary. Finally, by more ad-hoc arguments, we prove the nefness of certain special classes.
