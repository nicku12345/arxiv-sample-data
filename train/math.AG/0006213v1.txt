We propose a definition of ``nonabelian mixed Hodge structure'' together with a construction associating to a smooth projective variety X and to a nonabelian mixed Hodge structure V, the ``nonabelian cohomology of X with coefficients in V'' which is a (pre-)nonabelian mixed Hodge structure denoted H=Hom(X_M, V). We describe the basic definitions and then give some conjectures saying what is supposed to happen. At the end we compute an example: the case where V has underlying homotopy type the complexified 2-sphere, and mixed Hodge structure coming from its identification with \pp ^1. For this example we show that Hom (X_M,V) is a namhs for any smooth projective variety X.
