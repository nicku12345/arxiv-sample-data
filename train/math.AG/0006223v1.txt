We prove that the fake projective planes constructed from the diadic discrete group discovered by Cartwright, Mantero, Steger, and Zappa are connected Shimura varieties associated to a certain unitary group. The necessary Shimura data, as well as the unitary group, are explicitly described. We also give a field of definition of these fake projective planes.
