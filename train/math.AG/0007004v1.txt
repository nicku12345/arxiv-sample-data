This is the Foreword to the book ``Explicit birational geometry of 3-folds'', edited by A. Corti and M. Reid, CUP Jun 2000, ISBN: 0 521 63641 8, with papers by K. Altmann, A. Corti, A.R. Iano-Fletcher, J. Koll\'ar, A.V. Pukhlikov and M. Reid.   One of the main achievements of algebraic geometry over the last 20 years is the work of Mori and others extending minimal models and the Enriques--Kodaira classification to 3-folds. This book is an integrated suite of papers centred around applications of Mori theory to birational geometry. Four of the papers (those by Pukhlikov, Fletcher, Corti, and the long joint paper Corti, Pukhlikov and Reid) work out in detail the theory of birational rigidity of Fano 3-folds; these contributions work for the first time with a representative class of Fano varieties, 3-fold hypersurfaces in weighted projective space, and include an attractive introductory treatment and a wealth of detailed computation of special cases.
