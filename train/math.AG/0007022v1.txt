In this paper we give a description of hypersurfaces with trivial ring AK(S), introduced by the second author as following. Let X be an affine variety and let G(X) be the group generated by all \Bbb {C}^+-actions on X. Then AK(X) is the subring of all regular G(X)- invariant functions on X. We show that a smooth affine surface S with AK(S)=\Bbb C is quasihomogeneous and so may be obtained from a smooth rational projective surface by deleting a divisor of special form, which is called a ``zigzag''. We denote by A the set of all such surfaces, and by H those which have only three components in the zigzag. We prove that for a surface S \in A the following statements are equivalent:   1. S is isomorphic to a hypersurface;   2. S is isomorphic to a hypersurface, defined by equation xy=p(z) in \Bbb {C}^3 , where p is a polynomial with simple roots only;   3. S admits a fixed-point free \Bbb {C}^+- action;   4. S\in H. Moreover, if S_1  belongs to H, and S_2 does not, then S_1\times \Bbb {C}^k\not\cong S_2\times \Bbb {C}^k for any k\in\Bbb N.
