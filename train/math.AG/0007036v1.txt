We present formulas for the homogenous multivariate resultant as a quotient of two determinants. They extend classical Macaulay formulas, and involve matrices of considerably smaller size, whose non zero entries include coefficients of the given polynomials and coefficients of their Bezoutian. These formulas can also be viewed as an explicit computation of the morphisms and the determinant of a resultant complex.
