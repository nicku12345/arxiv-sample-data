In this paper we show a Zariski pair of sextics which is not a degeneration of the original example given by Zariski. This is the first example of this kind known. The two curves of the pair have a trivial Alexander polynomial. The difference in the topology of their complements can only be detected via finer invariants or techniques. In our case the generic braid monodromies, the fundamental groups, the characteristic varieties and the existence of dihedral coverings of \PP^2 ramified along them can be used to distinguish the two sextics. Our intention is not only to use different methods and give a general description of them but also to bring together different perspectives of the same problem.
