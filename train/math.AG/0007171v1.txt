We present a complete list of extremal elliptic K3 surfaces. There are altogether 325 of them. The first 112 coincides with Miranda-Persson's list for semi-stable ones. The data include the transcendental lattice which determines uniquely the K3 surface by a result of Shioda and Inose, the singular fibre type and the Mordell Weil group. As an application, we give a sufficient condition for the topological fundamental group of complement to an ADE-configuration of smooth rational curves on a K3 surface to be trivial.
