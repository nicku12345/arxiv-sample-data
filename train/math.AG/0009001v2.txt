In this paper, we consider moduli spaces of stable sheaves on abelian surfaces. Our main assumption is the primitivity of the associated Mukai vector. We construct many isomorphisms of muduli spaces induced by Fourier-Mukai functor. As an application, we show that deformation type of these spaces are determined by their dimension. We next show that the fiber of the albanese map is irreducible symplectic manifolds In particular, we describe the period by using Mukai lattice.   We also discuss deformation type of moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 surfaces.
