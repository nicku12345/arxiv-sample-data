Let G be an algebraic group and let \widetilde{\mathfrak g} be the corresponding affine algebra on some level. Consider the induced module V:=Ind^{\widetilde{\mathfrak g}}_{{\mathfrak g}[[t]](O_{G[[t]]}), where O_{G[[t]]} is the ring of regular functions on the group G[[t]].   In this paper we show that V is naturally a vertex operator algebra, which is "responsible" for D-modules on the loop group G((t)). Using the techiques of VOA we show that V is in fact a bimodule over the affine algebra. In addition, we show that V possesses a remarkable property related to its BRST reduction with respect to \widetilde{\mathfrak g}.   This paper has a considerable intersection with a recent preprint of Gorbunov, Malikov and Schechtman.
