We classify minimal pairs (X, G) for smooth rational projective surface X and finite group G of automorphisms on X. We also determine the fixed locus X^G and the quotient surface Y = X/G as well as the fundamental group of the smooth part of Y. The realization of each pair is included. Mori's extremal ray theory and recent results of Alexeev and also Ambro on the existence of good anti-canonical divisors are used.
