We give an explicit formula for the exponents (i.e. the spectra up to the shift by one) of an irreducible plane curve singularity in terms of Puiseux pairs. As an application we prove in this case Hertling's conjecture that the variance (i.e. the square of the standard deviation) of the exponents is bounded by the difference between the maximal and minimal exponents divided by 12.
