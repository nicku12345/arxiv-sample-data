By proving a particular case of a conjecture of Drezet, we show that a component of the Maruyama scheme of the semi-stable sheaves on the projective space \PP^n of rank n and Chern polynomial (1+t)^{n+2} is isomorphic to the Kronecher moduli N(n+1,2,n+2), for any odd n. In particular, such scheme defines a smooth minimal compactification of the moduli space of the rational normal curves in \PP^n, that generalizes the construction defined by G. Ellinsgrud, R. Piene and S. Str{\o}mme in the case n=3.
