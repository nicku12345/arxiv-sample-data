A component of the moduli space M_g(Y,b) of stable maps from genus g curves to a variety Y is said to be regular if it is generically smooth and of the expected dimension provided by deformation theory. In this note we prove existence of regular components of M_g(Y,b) when Y is a product of projective spaces. This result can also be seen as a general position theorem for Brill-Noether loci in M_g.
