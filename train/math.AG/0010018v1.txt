In this paper we prove the topological uniqueness of maximal arrangements of a real plane algebraic curve with respect to three lines. More generally, we prove the topological uniqueness of a maximally arranged algebraic curve on a real toric surface. We use the moment map as a tool for studying the topology of real algebraic curves and their complexifications.
