The article investigates the following question: given a projective variety X acted on by a connected and reductive group G, which is the relationship between the Gromov-Witten invariants of X and those of X//G? In this study we shall also try to give an algebraic approach to the so called Hamiltonian Gromov-Witten invariants which have appeared rather recenly in the literature.
