Let k be an integer such that 1\leq k\leq n-5, and X_{2n-2-k}\subset \mathbf P^n a general projective hypersurface of degree d=2n-2-k. In this paper we prove that the only k-dimensional subvariety Y of X_{2n-2-k} having geometric genus zero is the one covered by the lines. As an immediate corollary we obtain that, for n>5, the general X_{2n-3}\subset \mathbf P^n, contains no rational curves of degree \delta >1.
