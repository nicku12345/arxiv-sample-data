For a finite Abelian subgroup A of SL(3,C), Ito and Nakajima proved that the tautological bundles on the A-Hilbert scheme Y = A-Hilb(C^3) form a basis of the K-theory of Y. We establish the relations between these bundles in the Picard group of Y and hence, following a recipe introduced by Reid, construct an explicit basis of the integral cohomology of Y in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible representations of A.
