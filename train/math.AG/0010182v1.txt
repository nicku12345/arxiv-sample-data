We show that the fundamental group of the complement of any irreducible tame torus sextics in \bf P^2 is isomorphic to \bf Z_2*\bf Z_3 except one class. The exceptional class has the configuration of the singularities \{C_{3,9},3A_2\} and the fundamental group is bigger than \bf Z_2*\bf Z_3. In fact, the Alexander polynomial is given by (t^2-t+1)^2. For the proof, we first reduce the assertion to maximal curves and then we compute the fundamental groups for maximal tame torus curves.
