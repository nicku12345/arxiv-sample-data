We use pluriharmonic maps to study representations of fundamental groups of algebraic manifolds. This approach is functorial in the sense that the restriction of such a map to a fiber of a fibration remains pluriharmonic, and on this basis, we can investigate the relation between the properties of the original representation and what can be inferred by restricting it to the fibers of a fibration.
