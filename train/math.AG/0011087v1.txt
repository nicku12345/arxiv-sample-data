We describe smooth rational projective algebraic surfaces over an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2 which contain n \ge \b_2-2 disjoint smooth rational curves with self-intersection -2, where \b_2 is the second Betti number. In the last section this is applied to the study of minimal complex surfaces of general type with p_g = 0 and K^2 = 8, 9 which admit an automorphism of order 2.
