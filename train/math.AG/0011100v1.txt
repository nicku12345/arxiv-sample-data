We prove that the dimension 0 part of the tautological ring of the moduli space of stable pointed curves is one-dimensional. This provides the first genus-free evidence for a conjecture of Faber and Pandharipande that the tautological ring of the moduli space is Gorenstein, answering in the affirmative a question of Hain and Looijenga.
