Let f:X\to Y be a Cohen-Macaulay map of finite type between Noetherian schemes, and :Y'\to Y a base change map, with Y' Noetherian. Let f' be the base change of f under g and g' the base change of g under f. We show that there is a canonical isomorphism between {g'}^*\omega_f and \omega_{f'}, where \omega_f and \omega_{f'} are the relative dualizing sheaves. The map underlying this isomorphism is easily described when f is proper, and has subtler description when f is not. If f is smooth we show that this map between the dualizing sheaves corresponds to the canonical identification of differential forms. Our results generalize the results of B. Conrad in two directions - wedo not need the properness assumption, and we do not need to assume that theschemes involved carry dualizing complexes. Residual complexes do not appear in this paper.
