Mathematical instanton bundles of rank 4 and c_2=2 on {\mathbb P}^4 have a smoothquasiprojective moduli space, which is shown via a direct GIT construction. A complete classification of jumping lines of these vector bundles is obtained. The duals of these bundles are described. Dimension computations and irreducibility proofs for some "interesting" subsets of the moduli space are presented. Restrictions of vector bundles from {\mathbb P}^4 to {\mathbb P}^3 are shown to produce mathematical instanton bundles on {\mathbb P}^3.
