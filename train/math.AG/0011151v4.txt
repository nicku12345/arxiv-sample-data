We consider geometrical problems on Gorenstein hypersurface orbifolds of dimension n \geq 4 through the theory of Hilbert scheme of group orbits. For a linear special group G acting on \CZ^n, we study the G-Hilbert scheme, \hl^G(\CZ^n), and crepant resolutions of \CZ^n/G for G=the A-type abelian group  A_r(n). For n=4, we obtain the explicit structure of \hl^{A_r(4)}(\CZ^4). The crepant resolutions of \CZ^4/A_r(4) are constructed through their relation with \hl^{A_r(4)}(\CZ^4), and the connections between these crepant resolutions are found by the "flop" procedure of 4-folds. We also make some primitive discussion on \hl^G(\CZ^n) for the G= alternating group {\goth A}_{n+1} of degree n+1 with the standard representation on \CZ^n; the detailed structure of \hl^{{\goth A}_4}(\CZ^3) is explicitly constructed.
