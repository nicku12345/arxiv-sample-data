Unfortunately, some proofs in the first version of this paper were incorrect. In this revised version, some minor gaps are fixed, one serious mistake found. The main theorem is now claimed only under a restrictive technical assumption. This invalidates the application to quotient singularities by the Weyl group of type G_2. Everything else still stands (in particular, the claim that every symplectic resolution is semismall).
