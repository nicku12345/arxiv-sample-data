In this paper we complete the proof began by A. Polishchuk and E. Zaslow (math.AG/9801119) of a weak version of Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture for elliptic curves. The main difference to the work of Polishchuk and Zaslow is that we consider morphisms between any pair of objects, not only in the transversal case. This enables us to show the conjectured equivalence of categories.
