In their paper "Quantum cohomology of projective bundles over P^n" (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. (1998)350:9 3615-3638) Z.Qin and Y.Ruan introduce interesting techniques for the computation of the quantum ring of manifolds which are projectivized bundles over projective spaces; in particular, in the case of splitting bundles they prove under some restrictions the formula of Batyrev about the quantum ring of toric manifolds. Here we prove the formula of Batyrev on the quantum Chern-Leray equation for a large class of splitting bundles.
