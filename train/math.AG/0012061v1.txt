We introduce and study configuration schemes, which are obtained by ``glueing'' usual schemes along closed embeddings. The category of coherent sheaves on a configuration scheme is investigated. Smooth configuration schemes provide alternative ``resolutions of singularities'' of usual singular schemes. We consider in detail the case when the singular scheme is a union of hyperplanes in a projective space.
