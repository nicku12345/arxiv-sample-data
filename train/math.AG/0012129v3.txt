Let X be a smooth complete curve, G be a reductive group and P\subset G a parabolic.   Following Drinfeld, one defines a compactification \widetilde{\on{Bun}}_P of the moduli stack of P-bundles on X.   The present paper is concerned with the explicit description of the Intersection Cohomology sheaf of \widetilde{\on{Bun}}_P. The description is given in terms of the combinatorics of the Langlands dual Lie algebra \check{\mathfrak g}.
