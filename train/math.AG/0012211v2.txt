This paper is devoted to the classification of irregular surfaces of general type with p_g=q=2 and non birational bicanonical map. The main result is that, if S is such a surface and if S is minimal with no pencil of curves of genus 2, then S is a double cover of a principally polarized abelian surface (A,\Theta), with \Theta irreducible. The double cover S\to A is branched along a divisor B\in |2\Theta|, having at most double points and so K_S^2=4.
