We classify smooth toric Fano varieties of dimension n\geq 3 containing a toric divisor isomorphic to \PP^{n-1}. As a consequence of this classification, we show that any smooth complete toric variety X of dimension n\geq 3 with a T-fixed point x\in X such that the blow-up B_x(X) of X at x is Fano is isomorphic either to \PP^n or to the blow-up of \PP^n along a \PP^{n-2}. As expected, such results are proved using toric Mori theory due to Reid.
