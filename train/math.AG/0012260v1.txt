Inductive formulas for the Betti numbers of the moduli spaces of stable holomorphic vector bundles of coprime rank and degree over a fixed Riemann surface of genus at least two were obtained by Harder, Narasimhan, Desale and Ramanan using number theoretic methods and the Weil conjectures and were rederived by Atiyah and Bott using gauge theory. In this note we observe that there are similar inductive formulas for determining the Hodge numbers of these moduli spaces.
