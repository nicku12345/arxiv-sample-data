In this article we investigate Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formulae for line bundles on irreducible symplectic K\"ahler manifolds. As Huybrechts has shown, for every irreducible complex K\"ahler manifold X of dimension 2n, there are numbers a_0, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that \chi(L) = \sum_{k = 0}^n a_{2k}/(2k)! q_X(c_1(L))^k for the Euler characteristic of a line bundle L, where q_X: H^2(X, \mathbbm C) \to \mathbbm C is the Beauville-Bogomolov quadratic form of X.   Using Rozansky-Witten classes similar to Hitchin and Sawon, we obtain a formula expressing the a_{2k} in terms of Chern numbers of X. Furthermore, for the n-th generalized Kummer variety \KA n, we prove \chi(L) = (n + 1) \binom{q(c_1(L)) / 2 + n} n by purely algebro-geometric methods, where q is the form q_X up to a positive rational constant. A similar formula is already known for the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional subschemes of length n on a K3-surface.   Using our results, we are able to calculate all Chern numbers of the generalized Kummer varieties \KA n for n \leq 5. For n \leq 4 these results were previously obtained by Sawon.
