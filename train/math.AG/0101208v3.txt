We present a proof of embedded desingularization for closed subschemes which does not make use of Hilbert-Samuel function and avoids Hironaka's notion of normal flatness.   This proof, already sketched in [A course on constructive desingularization and equivariance. In {\em Resolution of singularities (Obergurgl, 1997)}, vol. 181 {\em Progr. Math.}, Birkh\"auser, 2000.] page 224, is done by showing that desingularization of a closed subscheme X, in a smooth sheme W, is achieved by taking an algorithmic principalization for the ideal I(X), associated to the embedded scheme X.
