Given a complex manifold X, a normal crossing divisor D\subset X whose irreducible components D_1,...,D_s are smooth, and a choice of natural numbers r=(r_1,...,r_s), we construct a manifold X(D,\ur) with an action of a torus \Gamma and we prove that some full subcategory of the category of \Gamma-equivariant vector bundles on X(D,r) is equivalent to the category of parabolic vector bundles on (X,D) in which the lengths of the filtrations over each irreducible component of X are given by r. When X is Kaehler, we study the Kaehler cone of X(D,r) and the relation between the corresponding notions of slope-stability.
