The goal is to verify the Hodge conjecture (and some related conjectures) for certain moduli spaces. It is shown that the (generalized) Hodge conjecture holds for the projective moduli spaces of vector bundles over an abelian or K3 surface or a curve if it holds for all powers of the surface or curve. In the latter case, the curve can be replaced by its Jacobian. As a consequence the generalized Hodge conjecture holds for these moduli spaces when the curve is very general. A similar result is proved for the Hilbert schemes of points over an arbitrary surface.
