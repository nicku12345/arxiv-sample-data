This paper studies the infinitesimal variation of the Lefschetz decomposition associated with a compatible sl_2-representation on a graded algebra. This allows to prove that the Jordan-Lefschetz property holds infinitesimally for the Kaehler Lie algebra (introduced by Looijenga and Lunts) of any compact Kaehler manifold. As a second application we describe how the space of harmonic forms changes when a Ricci-flat Kaehler form is deformed infinitesimally.
