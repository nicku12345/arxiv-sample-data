Let G denote an adjoint semi-simple group over an algebraically closed field and T a maximal torus of G. Following Contou-Carr\`ere [CC], we consider the Bott-Samelson resolution of a Schubert variety as a variety of galleries in the building associated to the group G. We first determine a cellular decomposition of this variety analogous to the Bruhat decomposition of a Schubert variety and then we describe the fibre of this resolution above a T-fixed point.
