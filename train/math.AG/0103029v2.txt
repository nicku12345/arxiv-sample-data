A broadly applicable geometric approach for constructing nef divisors on blow ups of algebraic surfaces at n general points is given; it works for all surfaces in all characteristics for any n. This construction is used to obtain substantial improvements for currently known lower bounds for n point Seshadri constants. Remarks are included about a range of applications to classical problems involving linear systems on P2.
