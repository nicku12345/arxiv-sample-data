Denote by MI(k) the moduli space of k-instanton bundles E of rank 2 on \PP^3=\PP(V) and by Z_k(E) the scheme of k-jumping lines.   We prove that [E]\in MI(k) is not stable for the action of SL(V) if Z_k(E)\neq\emptyset. Moreover \dim Sym(E)\ge 1 if length Z_k(E)\ge 2.   We prove also that E is special if and only if Z_k(E) is a smooth conic.   The action of SL(V) on the moduli of special instanton bundles is studied in detail.
