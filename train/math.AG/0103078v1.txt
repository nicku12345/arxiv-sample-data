In this note we prove that the moduli space of rank 2n symplectic instanton bundles on {\PP^{2n+1}}, defined from the well known monad condition, is affine. This result was not known even in the case n=1, where the real instanton bundles correspond to self dual Yang Mills Sp(1)-connections over the 4-dimensional sphere. The result is proved as a consequence of the existence of an invariant of the multidimensional matrices representing the instanton bundles.
