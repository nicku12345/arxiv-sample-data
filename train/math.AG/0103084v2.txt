We call a log variety (X, D) algebraically hyperbolic if there exists a positive number e such that 2g(C) - 2 + i(C, D) >= e deg(C) for all curves C on X, where i(C, D) is the number of the intersections between D and the normalization of C. Among other things, we proved that (P^2, D) is algebraically hyperbolic for a very general curve D of degree at least 5. More specifically, we showed that 2g(C) - 2 + i(C, D) >= (deg(D) - 4) deg C for all curves C on P^2. For example, fix a very general quintic curve D and then for any map f: C = P^1 --> P^2, there are at least deg(f) + 2 distinct points on C that map to points on D by f.
