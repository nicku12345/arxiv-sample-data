Gorenstein liaison seems to be the natural notion to generalize to higher codimension the well-known results about liaison of varieties of codimension~2 in projective space. In this paper we study points in {\mathbb P}^3 and curves in {\mathbb P}^4 in an attempt to see how far typical codimension~2 results will extend. While the results are satisfactory for small degree, we find in each case examples where we cannot decide the outcome. These examples are candidates for counterexamples to the hoped-for extensions of codimension~2 theorems.
