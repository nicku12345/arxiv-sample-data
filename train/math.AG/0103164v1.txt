The paper is dedicated to the study of algebraic manifolds whose quantum cohomology or a part of it is a semisimple Frobenius manifold. Theorem 1.8.1 says, roughly speaking, that the sum of (p,p)--cohomology spaces is a maximal Frobenius submanifold that has chances to be semisimple. Theorem 1.8.3 provides a version of the Reconstruction theorem, assuming semisimplicity but not H^2--generation. Theorem 3.6.1 establishes the semisimplicity for all del Pezzo surfaces, providing an evidence for the conjecture that semisimplicity is related to the existence of a full system of exceptional sheaves of the appropriate length. Finally, in \S 2 we calculate special coordinates for three families of Fano threefolds with minimal cohomology.
