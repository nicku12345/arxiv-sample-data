We introduce deformation theoretic methods for determining when a curve X in a non-hyperelliptic jacobian JC will deform with JC to a non-jacobian. We apply these methods to a particular class of curves in the second symmetric power C^{(2)} of C. More precisely, given a pencil g^1_d of degree d on C, let X be the curve parametrizing pairs of points in divisors of g^1_d (see the paper for the precise scheme-theoretical definition). We prove that if X deforms infinitesimally out of the jacobian locus with JC then either d=4 or d=5, dimH^0 (g^1_5) = 3 and C has genus 4.
