Let X be a closed subscheme embedded in a scheme W smooth over a field {\bf k} of characteristic zero, and let {\mathcal I}(X) be the sheaf of ideals defining X. Assume that the set of regular points of X is dense in X. We prove that there exists a proper, birational morphism, \pi: W_r\longrightarrow W, obtained as a composition of monoidal transformations, so that if X_r\subset W_r denotes the strict transform of X\subset W then: 1) The morphism \pi:W_r\longrightarrow W is an embedded desingularization of X (as in Hironaka's Theorem); 2) The {\em total transform} of {\mathcal I}(X) in {\mathcal O}_{W_r} factors as a product of an invertible sheaf of ideals {\mathcal L} supported on the exceptional locus, and the sheaf of ideals defining the strict transform of X (i.e. {\mathcal I}(X){\mathcal O}_{W_r}={\mathcal L}\cdot{\mathcal I}(X_r)). This result is stronger than Hironaka's Theorem, in fact (2) is novel and does not hold for desingularizations which follow Hironaka's line of proof unless X is a hypersurface. We will say that W_r\longrightarrow W defines a {\em Strong Desingularization of X}.
