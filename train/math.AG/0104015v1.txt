We shall give, in an optimal form, a sufficient numerical condition for the finiteness of the fundamental group of the smooth locus of a normal K3 surface. We shall moreover prove that, if the normal K3 surface is elliptic and the above fundamental group is not finite, then there is a finite covering which is a complex torus.
