We prove that there is an infinite sequence of pairs of plane cuspidal curves C_{m,1} and C_{m,2}, such that the pairs (\Bbb CP^2, C_{m,1}) and (\Bbb CP^2, C_{m,2}) are diffeomorphic, but C_{m,1} and C_{m,2} have non-equivalent braid monodromy factorizations. These curves give rise to the negative solutions of "Dif=Def" and "Dif=Iso" problems for plane irreducible cuspidal curves. In our examples, C_{m,1} and C_{m,2} are complex conjugated.
