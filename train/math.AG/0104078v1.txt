The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of large complete subvarieties in moduli spaces of rank two stable sheaves with arbitrary c_1 and sufficiently large c_2 on algebraic surfaces. Then we study the restriction of these sheaves to curves of high degree embedded in the surface. In the final section we gives a relation with the spin strata defined by Pidstrigach and Tyurin.
