We introduce a class of cycles, called nondegenerate, strictly decomposable cycles, and show that the image of each cycle in this class under the refined cycle map to an extension group in the derived category of arithmetic mixed Hodge structures does not vanish. This class contains certain cycles in the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi map. The construction gives a refinement of Nori's argument in the case of a self-product of a curve. As an application, we show that a higher cycle which is not annihilated by the reduced higher Abel-Jacobi map produces uncountably many indecomposable higher cycles on the product with a variety having a nonzero global 1-form.
