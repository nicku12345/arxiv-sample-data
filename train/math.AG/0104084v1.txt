A reconstruction theorem for genus 0 gravitational quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory is proved. A new linear equivalence in the Picard group of the moduli space of genus 0 stable maps relating the pull-backs of line bundles from the target via different markings is used for the reconstruction result. Examples of calculations in quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory are given.
