We study del Pezzo fibrations of degree 1 with terminal singularities. A connection between singularities on del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 and Kodaira's classification of elliptic singular fibers will be studied in this paper. By this investigation we obtain several results on birational maps of del Pezzo fibrations of degree 1 with terminal singularities.
