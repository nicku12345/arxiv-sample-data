The existence of a vector field on a compact Kaehler manifold with nonempty zero locus and the properties of this zero locus strongly influence the geometry of the manifold. For example, J. Wahl proved that the existence of a vector field vanishing on an ample divisor of a projective normal variety X implies that X is a cone over this divisor. If X is smooth, X will be isomorphic to the n-dimensional projective space.   This paper is a first attempt to generalize Wahl's theorem to higher codimensions: Given a complex smooth projective threefold X and a vector field on X vanishing on an irreducible and reduced curve which is the scheme theoretic intersection of two ample divisors, X is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional projective space or the 3-dimensional quadric.
