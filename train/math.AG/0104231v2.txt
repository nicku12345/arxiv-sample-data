In this paper, we construct an object of the abelian category of mixed Tate motive associated to multiple zeta values. as a consequence, we prove the inequality of the dimension of the vector space generated by multiple zeta values, which is conjectured by Zagier. (Some errors was corrected from the first version. Namely, we changed the definition of the boundary \bold B^0.)
