We study the birational geometry of varieties of maximal Albanese dimension. In particular we discuss criteria for a generically finite morphism of varieties of maximal Albanese dimension to be birational; we give a new characterization of Theta divisors; we study the Albanese map and refine some of the results of Koll\'ar; finally we use these results to birationally classify varieties with P_3(X)=2 and q(X)=dim (X). Our method combines the generic vanishing theorems of Green and Lazarsfeld, the theory of Fourier Mukai transforms and the results of Koll\`ar on higher direct images of dualizing sheaves.
