We discuss sufficient conditions for a given curve to be covered by a maximal curve with the covering being unramified; it turns out that the given curve itself will be also maximal. We relate our main result to the question of whether or not a maximal curve is covered by the Hermitian curve. We also provide examples illustrating the results.
