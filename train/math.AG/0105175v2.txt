We prove that for every compact K\"ahler manifold X there exists an L-infinity morphism, lifting the usual cup product in cohomology, from the Kodaira-Spencer differential graded Lie algebra to the suspension of the space of linear endomorphisms of the singular cohomology of X. As a consequence we get an algebraic proof of the principle ``obstructions to deformations of compact Kaehler manifolds annihilate ambient cohomology''.
