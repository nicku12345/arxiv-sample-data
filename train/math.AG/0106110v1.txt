It is proved that a general Fano hypersurface of index 1 (in the projective space) with isolated singularities of general position is birationally rigid. Therefore it cannot be fibered into uniruled varieties of a smaller dimension by a rational map. The group of birational self-maps is either trivial or cyclic of order two.
