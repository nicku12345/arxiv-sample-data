In this paper, we consider the preservation of stability by using the notion of Twisted stability. As applications, (1) we show that moduli spaces of vector bundles on K3 and abelian surfaces are irreducible, (2) we compute Hodge polynomials of some moduli spaces of vector bundles on Enriques surfaces and on elliptic surfaces with a section.
