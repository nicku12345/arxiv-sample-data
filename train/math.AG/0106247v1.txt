We propose a generalization of the notion of {\bf R}-split mixed Hodge structure by defining a {\bf R}-splitting level for mixed Hodge structures. This is a discrete invariant taking values in positive integers and equal to 0 for {\bf R}-split mixed Hodge structures. We describe some properties of this invariant for classical operations on these structures and give some explicit calculation.
