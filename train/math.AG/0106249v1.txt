In this paper we study the semi-stable reduction of Galois covers of degree p above semi-stable curves over a complete discrete valuation ring of inequal characteristics (0,p). We are also able to describe the Galois action on these covers in terms of some geometric and combinatorial datas in characteristic p endowed with the action of the Galois group of the residue field.
