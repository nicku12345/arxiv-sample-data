We study minimal {\em double planes} of general type with K^2=8 and p_g=0, namely pairs (S,\sigma), where S is a minimal complex algebraic surface of general type with K^2=8 and p_g=0 and \sigma is an automorphism of S of order 2 such that the quotient S/\sigma is a rational surface. We prove that S is a free quotient (F\times C)/G, where C is a curve, F is an hyperelliptic curve, G is a finite group that acts faithfully on F and C, and \sigma is induced by the automorphism \tau\times Id of F\times C, \tau being the hyperelliptic involution of F. We describe all the F, C and G that occur: in this way we obtain 5 families of surfaces with p_g=0 and K^2=8, of which we believe only one was previously known.   Using our classification we are able to give an alternative description of these surfaces as double covers of the plane, thus recovering a construction proposed by Du Val. In addition we study the geometry of the subset of the moduli space of surfaces of general type with p_g=0 and K^2=8 that admit a double plane structure.
