In this paper we prove the 2-local part of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjectures on tosion in motivic cohomology. In particular we prove the Milnor conjecture relating Milnor's K-theory and the Galois cohomology with Z/2-coefficients. This paper is a new version of the previously distributed preprint "The Milnor Conjecture".
