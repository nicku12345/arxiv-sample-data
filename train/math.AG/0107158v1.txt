We construct a canonical compactification SQ^{toric}_{g,K} of the moduli of abelian varieties over Z[\zeta_N, 1/N] where \zeta_N is a primitive N-th root of unity. This is very similar to, but slightly diferent from the compactification constructed by the author in Inventiones vol. 136 (1999). Any degenerate abelian scheme on the boundary of SQ^{toric}_{g,K} is reduced and singular and it is one of the stable quasi-abelian varieties introduced by Alexeev and the author (Tohoku J. 1999).
