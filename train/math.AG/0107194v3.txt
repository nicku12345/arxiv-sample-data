We show that Fay's trisecant identity follows from the A_{infinity}-constraint between certain triple Massey products in the derived category of coherent sheaves on a curve. We also deduce the matrix analogue of this identity that can be conveniently formulated using quasideterminants of matrices with non-commuting entries. On the other hand, looking at more special triple Massey products we derive a formula for the tangent line to a canonically embedded curve at a given point.
