We study the unipotent completion \Pi^{DR}_{un}(x_0, x_1, X_K) of the de Rham fundamental groupoid [De] of a smooth algebraic variety over a local non-archimedean field K of characteristic 0.   We show that the vector space \Pi^{DR}_{un}(x_0, x_1, X_K) possesses a distinguished element. In the other words, given a vector bundle E on X_K together with a unipotent integrable connection, we have {\sf a canonical} isomorphism E_{x_0}\simeq E_{x_1} between the fibers. The latter construction is a generalization of Colmez's p-adic integration (rk E=2) and Coleman's p-adic iterated integrals (X_K is a curve with good reduction).   In the second part we prove that, if X_{K_0} is a smooth variety over an unramified extension of \mathbb{Q}_p with good reduction and r \leq \frac{p-1}{2} then there is a canonical isomorphism \Pi^{DR}_{r}(x_0, x_1, X_{K_0})\otimes B_{DR} \simeq \Pi^{et}_{r}(x_0, x_1, X_{\overline K_0}) \otimes B_{DR} compatible with the action of Galois group (Here \Pi^{DR}_{r}(x_0, x_1, X_{K_0}) is the level r quotient of \Pi^{DR}_{un}(x_0, x_1, X_K)). In particularly, it implies the Crystalline Conjecture for the fundamental group [Shiho] (for r \leq \frac{p-1}{2}) .
