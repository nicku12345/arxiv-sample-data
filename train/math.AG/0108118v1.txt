In this note we establish a new Fujita-type effective bound for the base point freeness of adjoint line bundles on a compact complex projective manifold of complex dimension n. The bound we obtain (approximately) differs from the linear bound conjectured by Fujita only by a factor of the cube root of n. As an application, a new effective statement for pluricanonical embeddings is derived.
