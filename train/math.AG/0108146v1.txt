Let W be the germ of a smooth complex surface around an exceptional curve and let E be a rank 2 vector bundle on W. We study the cohomological properties of a finite sequence E_i, 1 \leq i \leq t of rank 2 vector bundles canonically associated to E. We calculate numerical invariants of E in terms of the E_i. If S is a compact complex smooth surface and E is a rank 2 bundle on the blow- up of S at a point, we show that all values of c_2(E)-c_2(\pi_* E^{\vee\vee}) that are numerically possible are actually attained.
