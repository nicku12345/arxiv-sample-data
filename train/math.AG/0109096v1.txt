We propose a construction of string cohomology spaces for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces that arise in Batyrev's mirror symmetry construction. The spaces are defined explicitly in terms of the corresponding reflexive polyhedra in a mirror-symmetric manner. We draw connections with other approaches to the string cohomology, in particular with the work of Chen and Ruan.
