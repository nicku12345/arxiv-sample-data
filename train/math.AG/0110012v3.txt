If X is a smooth complex projective 3-fold with ample canonical divisor K, then the inequality K^3\ge {2/3}(2p_g-7) holds, where p_g denotes the geometric genus. This inequality is nearly sharp. We also give similar, but more complicated, inequalities for general minimal 3-folds of general type. (A noether type of inequality lies, by all means, on the other side of the Miyaoka-Yau inequality from the geographical point of view.)
