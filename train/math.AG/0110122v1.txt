A nodal Enriques surface can have at most 8 nodes. We give an explicit description of Enriques surfaces with 8 nodes, showing that they are quotients of products of elliptic curves by a group isomorphic to \Z_2^2 or to \Z_2^3 acting freely in codimension 1. We use this result to show that if S is a minimal surface of general type with p_g=0 such that the image of the bicanonical map is birational to an Enriques surface then K^2_S=3 and the bicanonical map is a morphism of degree 2.
