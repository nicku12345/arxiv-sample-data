Consider an algebraic torus of small dimension acting on an open subset of a complex vector space, or more generally on a quasiaffine variety such that a separated orbit space exists. We discuss under which conditions this orbit space is quasiprojective. One of our counterexamples provides a toric variety with enough effective invariant Cartier divisors that is not embeddable into a smooth toric variety.
