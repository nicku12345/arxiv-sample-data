Given a holomorphic vector bundle E:EX X over a compact K\"ahler manifold, one introduces twisted GW-invariants of X replacing virtual fundamental cycles of moduli spaces of stable maps f: \Sigma \to X by their cap-product with a chosen multiplicative characteristic class of H^0(\Sigma, f^* E) - H^1(\Sigma, f^*E). Using the formalism of quantized quadratic hamiltonians, we express the descendent potential for the twisted theory in terms of that for X. The result (Theorem 1) is a consequence of Mumford's Riemann -- Roch -- Grothendieck formula applied to the universal stable map.   When E is concave, and the inverse \CC^{\times}-equivariant Euler class is chosen, the twisted theory yields GW-invariants of EX. The ``non-linear Serre duality principle'' expresses GW-invariants of EX via those of the supermanifold \Pi E^*X, where the Euler class and E^* replace the inverse Euler class and E. We derive from Theorem 1 the nonlinear Serre duality in a very general form (Corollary 2).   When the bundle E is convex, and a submanifold Y\subset X is defined by a global section, the genus 0 GW-invariants of \Pi E X coincide with those of Y. We prove a ``quantum Lefschetz hyperplane section principle'' (Theorem 2) expressing genus 0 GW-invariants of a complete intersection Y via those of X. This extends earlier results of Y.-P. Lee and A. Gathmann and yields most of the known mirror formulas for toric complete intersections.
