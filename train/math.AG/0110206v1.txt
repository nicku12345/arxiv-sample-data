We classify all the surfaces of general type whose canonical map is composed with a pencil if they are the quotient of the diagonal action by an Abelian group acting over the product of two curves. As far as we know all the previous examples with isotrivial canonical map are very particular cases of our construction; moreover we find an unexpected action by a group of order 16. This construction can be easily generalizable to all dimensions.
