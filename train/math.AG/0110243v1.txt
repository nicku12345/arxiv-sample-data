In modern form, Hilbert's Theorem 90 tells us that R^1f_*(G_m)=0, where f is the canonical map between the etale site and the Zariski site of a scheme X. I construct examples showing that the corresponding statement for algebraic spaces does not hold. The first example is a nonseparated smooth 1-dimensional bug-eyed cover in Kollar's sense. The second example is a nonnormal proper algebraic space obtained by identifying points on suitable nonprojective smooth proper schemes.
