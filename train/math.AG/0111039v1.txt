A variety X is covered by lines if there exist a finite number of lines contained in X passing through each general point. I prove two theorems.   Theorem 1:Let X^n\subset P^M be a variety covered by lines. Then there are at most n! lines passing through a general point of X.   Theorem 2:Let X^n\subsetP^{n+1} be a hypersurface and let x\in X be a general point. If the set of lines having contact to order k with X at x is of dimension greater than expected, then the lines having contact to order k are actually contained in X.
