Here, we resume and broaden the results concerned which appeared in math.AG/0101098 and math.AG/0104021. We start from summing up our example of a complex algebraic surface which is not deformation equivalent to its complex conjugate and which, moreover, has no homeomorphisms reversing the canonical class. Then, we construct several series of higher dimensional compact complex manifolds having the same property. We end with discussing applications to the Dif=Def problems, to the existence of diffeomorphic plane cuspidal curves non equivalent under equisingular deformations and to the existence of (deformation) non equivalent symplectic structures with opposite canonical classes.
