We study the minimal complex surfaces of general type with p_g=0 and K^2=7 or 8 whose bicanonical map is not birational. In the paper 'The bicanonical map of surfaces with p_g=0 and K^2\ge 7' we have shown that if S is such a surface, then the bicanonical map has degree 2. Here we describe precisely such surfaces showing that there is a fibration f\colon S\to \pp^1 such that: i) the general fibre F of f is a genus 3 hyperelliptic curve; ii) the involution induced by the bicanonical map of S restricts to the hyperelliptic involution of F. Furthermore, if K^2_S=8, then f is an isotrivial fibration with 6 double fibres, and if K^2_S=7, then f has 5 double fibres and it has precisely one fibre with reducible support, consisting of two components.
