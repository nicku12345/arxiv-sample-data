We prove a formula which compares intersection numbers of conormal varieties of two projective varieties and their dual varieties.   When one of them is linear, we can recover the usual Plucker formula for the degree of the dual variety.   The basic strategy of the proof is to study a category of Lagrangian subvarieties in the cotangent bundle of a projective space under a birational transformation.
