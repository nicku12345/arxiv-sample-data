In this paper we study smooth toric Fano varieties using primitive relations and toric Mori theory. We show that for any irreducible invariant divisor D in a toric Fano variety X, we have 0\leq\rho_X-\rho_D\leq 3, for the difference of the Picard numbers of X and D. Moreover, if \rho_X-\rho_D>0 (with some additional hypotheses if \rho_X-\rho_D=1), we give an explicit birational description of X. Using this result, we show that when dim X=5, we have \rho_X\leq 9.   In the second part of the paper, we study equivariant birational morphisms f whose source is Fano. We give some general results, and in dimension 4 we show that f is always a composite of smooth equivariant blow-ups. Finally, we study under which hypotheses a non-projective toric variety can become Fano after a smooth equivariant blow-up.
