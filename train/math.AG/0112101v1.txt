The cosimplicial scheme Delta^bullet = \Delta^0 smallmatrix \to smallmatrix \Delta^1 smallmatrix to smallmatrix ...;\quad \Delta^n :=\Spec\Big(k[t_0,...c,t_n]/(\sum t_i -t)\Big) was used in B to define higher Chow groups. In this note, we let t tend to 0 and replace \Delta^\bullet by a degenerate version Q^\bullet = Q^0 smallmatrix to smallmatrix Q^1 smallmatrix to smallmatrix ...;\quad Q^n := \Spec\Big(k[t_0,...c,t_n]/(\sum t_i)\Big)  to define an additive version of the higher Chow groups. For a field k, we show the Chow group of 0-cycles on Q^n in this theory is isomorphic to the absolute (n-1)-K\"ahler forms \Omega^{n-1}_k.   An analogous degeneration on the level of de Rham cohomology associated to ``constant modulus'' degenerations of varieties in various contexts is discussed.
