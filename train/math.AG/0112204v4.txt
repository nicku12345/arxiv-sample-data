Let M be a complex projective manifold of dimension n+1 and f a meromorphic function on M obtained by a generic pencil of hyperplane sections of M. The n-th cohomology vector bundle of f_0=f|_{M-\RR}, where \RR is the set of indeterminacy points of f, is defined on the set of regular values of f_0 and we have the usual Gauss-Manin connection on it. Following Brieskorn's methods in [bri], we extend the n-th cohomology vector bundle of f_0 and the associated Gauss-Manin connection to \pl by means of differential forms. The new connection turns out to be meromorphic on the critical values of f_0. We prove that the meromorphic global sections of the vector bundle with poles of arbitrary order at \infty\in\pl is isomorphic to the Brieskorn module of f in a natural way, and so the Brieskorn module in this case is a free \Pf-module of rank \beta_n, where \Pf is the ring of polynomials in t and \beta_n is the dimension of n-th cohomology group of a regular fiber of f_0.
