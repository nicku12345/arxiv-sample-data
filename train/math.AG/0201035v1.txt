The second author classified configurations of the singularities on tame sextics of torus type. In this paper, we give a complete classification of the singularities on irreducible sextics of torus type, without assuming the tameness of the sextics. We show that there exists 121 configurations and there are 5 pairs and a triple of configurations for which the corresponding moduli spaces coincide, ignoring the respective torus decomposition.
