In this note, we introduce the notion of a singular principal G-bundle, associated to a reductive algebraic group G over the complex numbers by means of a faithful representation \varrho^\p\colon G\lra \SL(V). This concept is meant to provide an analogon to the notion of a torsion free sheaf as a generalization of the notion of a vector bundle. We will construct moduli spaces for these singular principal bundles which compactify the moduli spaces of stable principal bundles.
