Let X be a smooth quasi-projective variety over the algebraic closure of the rational number field. We show that the cycle map of the higher Chow group to Deligne cohomology is injective and the higher Hodge cycles are generated by the image of the cycle map as conjectured by Beilinson and Jannsen, if the cycle map to Deligne cohomology is injective and the Hodge conjecture is true for certain smooth projective varieties over the algebraic closure of the rational number field. We also verify the conjecture on the surjectivity in the case of the complement of a union of general hypersurfaces in a smooth projective variety.
