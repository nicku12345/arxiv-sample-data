Given a generically smooth stable curve over a discrete valuation ring such that its special fibre is irreducible with one double point, we construct a moduli stack over that descrete valuation ring which is a model for the moduli stack of vector bundles over the generic fibre of the curve. The model has the following nice properties:   1. It is regular.   2. Its special fibre is a normal crossing divisor.   3. The normalization of its special fibre is a locally trivial KGl-bundle over the moduli stack of vector bundles over the normalization of the special fibre of the curve.   Here KGl is a canonical compactification of the general linear group. Our motivation is that such a model may help to give recursion formulae for such cohomological invariants of the moduli stack of vector bundles on smooth curves which depend only on the genus of the curve.
