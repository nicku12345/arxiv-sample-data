In this paper we give a geometrical interpretation of an extension of mixed Hodge structures (MHS) obtained from the canonical MHS on the group ring of the fundamental group of a hyperelliptic curve modulo the fourth power of its augmentation ideal. We show that the class of this extension coincides with the regulator image of a canonical higher cycle in a hyperelliptic jacobian. This higher cycle was introduced and studied by Collino.
