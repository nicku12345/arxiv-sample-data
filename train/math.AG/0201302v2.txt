We prove that a smooth Fano hypersurface V=V_M\subset{\Bbb P}^M, M\geq 6, is birationally superrigid. In particular, it cannot be fibered into uniruled varieties by a non-trivial rational map and each birational map onto a minimal Fano variety of the same dimension is a biregular isomorphism. The proof is based on the method of maximal singularities combined with the connectedness principle of Shokurov and Koll\' ar.
