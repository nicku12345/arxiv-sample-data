The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new approach to study families of nodal curves on projective threefolds. Precisely, given X a smooth projective threefold, \E a rank-two vector bundle on X, L a very ample line bundle on X and k \geq 0, \delta >0  integers and denoted by V= {\V}_{\delta} ({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k}) the subscheme of {\Pp}(H^0({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k})) parametrizing global sections of {\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k} whose zero-loci are irreducible and \delta-nodal curves on X, we present a new cohomological description of the tangent space T_{[s]}({\V}_{\delta} ({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k})) at a point [s]\in {\V}_{\delta} ({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k}). This description enable us to determine effective and uniform upper-bounds for \delta, which are linear polynomials in k, such that the family V is smooth and of the expected dimension ({\em regular}, for short). The almost-sharpness of our bounds is shown by some interesting examples. Furthermore, when X is assumed to be a Fano or a Calaby-Yau threefold, we study in detail the regularity property of a point [s] \in V related to the postulation of the nodes of its zero-locus C_s =C \subset X. Roughly speaking, when the nodes of C are assumed to be in general position either on X or on an irreducible divisor of X having at worst log-terminal singularities or to lie on a l.c.i. and subcanonical curve in X, we find upper-bounds on \delta which are, respectively, cubic, quadratic and linear polynomials in k ensuring the regularity of V at [s]. Finally, when X= \Pt, we also discuss some interesting geometric properties of the curves given by sections parametrized by V.
