We construct one-parameter complex analytic families whose special fibers are complete toric varieties. Under some assumptions, the general fibers of these families also become toric varieties and we can explicitly describe the corresponding fans from the data of the fans corresponding to the special fibers. Using these families, we give a deformation family for a certain toric weakened Fano 3-fold. Moreover, we get some examples of toric weakened Fano 4-folds.
