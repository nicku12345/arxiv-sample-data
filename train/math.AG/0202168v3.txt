Here we focus on the geometry of \pdgbar, the compactification of the universal Picard variety constructed by L. Caporaso. In particular, we show that the moduli space of spin curves constructed by M. Cornalba naturally injects into \pdgbar and we give generators and relations of the rational divisor class group of \pdgbar, extending previous work by A. Kouvidakis.
