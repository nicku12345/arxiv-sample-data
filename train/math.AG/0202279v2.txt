The Reduction Map Theorem in H. Tsuji's work on numerical trivial fibrations is corrected and proven. To this purpose various definitions of Tsuji's new intersection numbers for pseudo-effective line bundles equipped with a positive singular hermitian metric are compared and their equivalence on sufficiently general smooth curves is shown. Numerically trivial varieties are characterized by a decomposition property of the curvature current. An important adjustment to the Reduction Map Theorem is to consider the fact that plurisubharmonic functions are singular on pluripolar sets.
