In the present note we show that any surface of general type with p_g=2,q=1 and non-birational bicanonical map has a pencil of curves of genus 2. Combining this result with previous ones, one obtains thatan irregular surface S of general type with \chi(S)\geq 2 and non-birational bicanonical map has a pencil of curves of genus 2.
