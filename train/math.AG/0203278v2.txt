The Richardson variety X_w^v is defined to be the intersection of the Schubert variety X_w and the opposite Schubert variety X^v. For X_w^v in the Grassmannian, we obtain a standard monomial basis for the homogeneous coordinate ring of X_w^v. We use this basis first to prove the vanishing of H^i(X_w^v,L^m), i > 0 , m \geq 0, where L is the restriction to X_w^v of the ample generator of the Picard group of the Grassmannian; then to determine a basis for the tangent space and a criterion for smoothness for X_w^v at any T-fixed point e_\t; and finally to derive a recursive formula for the multiplicity of X_w^v at any T-fixed point e_\t. Using the recursive formula, we show that the multiplicity of X_w^v at e_\t is the product of the multiplicity of X_w at e_\t and the multiplicity of X^v at e_\t. This result allows us to generalize the Rosenthal-Zelevinsky determinantal formula for multiplicities at T-fixed points of Schubert varieties to the case of Richardson varieties.
