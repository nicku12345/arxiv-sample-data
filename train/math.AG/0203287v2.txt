In this note, we shall prove that two smooth projective varieties of dim 2n connected by a Mukai flop have equivalent bounded derived categories. More precisely, let \phi : X - - \to X^+ be a Mukai flop with centers Y \subset X and Y^+ \subset X^+. In our case, the natural fuctor \Phi : D(X) \to D(X^+) defined by the graph of \phi is not fully faithful.   Instead, let X \to {\bar X} and X^+ \to {\bar X} be the birational contraction maps of the centers, and put {\hat X} := X \times_{{\bar X} X^+. Then {\hat X} is a normal crossing variety with two irreducible components. This {\hat X} defines a functor \Psi : D(X) \to D(X^+). We shall prove that this \Psi is an equivalence.   Recently, Wierzba and Wisniewski have announced that two birationally equivalent, complex projective symplectic 4-folds are connected by a finite sequence of Mukai flops. Our result with this shows that D(X) is a birational invariant for complex projective symplectic 4-folds.
