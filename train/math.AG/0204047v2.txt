Let S be a noetherian scheme, and let E be a coherent sheaf on it. We define a group-valued contravariant functor GL_E on S-schemes by associating to any S-scheme T the group GL_E(T) of all linear automorphisms of the pullback of E to T. This functor is clearly a sheaf in the fpqc topology. We prove that GL_E is representable by a group-scheme over S if and only if the sheaf E is locally free.
