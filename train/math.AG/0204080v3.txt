In this note we determine the Bernstein-Sato polynomial b_Q(s) of a generic central arrangement Q=\prod_{i=1}^kH_i of hyperplanes. We establish a connection between the roots of b_Q(s) and the degrees of the generators for the top cohomology of the corresponding Milnor fiber. This connection holds for all homogeneous polynomials. We also introduce certain subschemes of the arrangement determined by the roots of b_Q(s).
