Let X be a smooth complete curve, and let Bun_n be the moduli stack of rank n vector bundles on X. Let E be a local system on X.   In a recent paper of E.Frenkel, K.Vilonen and the author, it was shown that the vanishing of a certian functor Av_E^d acting from the category D(Bun_n) to itself, implies the geometric Langlands conjecture.   In this paper we establish the required vanishing result.   Our proof works for sheaves with char=0 coefficients, or with torsion coefficients when the parameter d is less than the characteristic.
