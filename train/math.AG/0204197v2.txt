Let A^{[[n]]} denote the 2(n - 1)-dimensional generalised Kummer variety constructed from the abelian surface A. Further, let X be an arbitrary smooth projective surface with \int_X c_1(X)^2 \neq 0, and X^{[k]} the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional subschemes of X of length k. We give a formula which expresses the value of any complex genus on A^{[[n]]} in terms of Chern numbers of the varieties X^{[k]}.   It is shown by Ellingsrud and Stroemme how to use Bott's residue formula to effectively calculate the Chern numbers of the Hilbert schemes (\IP^2)^{[k]} of points on the projective plane. Since \int_{\IP^2} c_1(\IP^2)^2 = 9 \neq 0 we can use these numbers and our formula to calculate the Chern numbers of the generalised Kummer varieties.   A table with all Chern numbers of the generalised Kummer varieties A^{[[n]]} for n \leq 8 is included.
