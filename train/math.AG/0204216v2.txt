Let C be a nonsingular irreducible projective curve of genus g\ge2 defined over the complex numbers. Suppose that 1\le n'\le n-1 and n'd-nd'=n'(n-n')(g-1). It is known that, for the general vector bundle E of rank n and degree d, the maximal degree of a subbundle of E of rank n' is d' and that there are finitely many such subbundles. We obtain a formula for the number of these maximal subbundles when (n',d')=1. For g=2, n'=2, we evaluate this formula explicitly. The numbers computed here are Gromov-Witten invariants in the sense of a recent paper of Ch. Okonek and A. Teleman (to appear in Commun. Math. Phys.) and our results answer a question raised in that paper. In this revised version some references are added.
