In a previous paper we showed that for every polarization on an abelian variety there is a dual polarization on the dual abelian variety. In this note we extend this notion of duality to families of polarized abelian varieties. As a main consequence we obtain an involution on the set of moduli spaces of polarized abelian varieties of dimension g. In particular, the moduli spaces \mathcal A_{(d_1,...,d_g)} and \mathcal A_{(d_1,\frac{d_1d_g}{d_{g-1}},...,\frac{d_1d_g}{d_2},d_g)} are canonically isomorphic.
