We study subvarieties of a general projective degree d hypersurface X_d\subset \mathbf P^n. Our main theorem, which improves previous results of L. Ein and C. Voisin, implies in particular the following sharp corollary: any subvariety of a general hypersurface X_{d}\subset {\mathbf P}^n, for n\geq 6 and d\geq 2n-2, is of general type.
