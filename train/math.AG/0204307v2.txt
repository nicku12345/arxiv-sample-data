Given a separated and locally finitely-presented Deligne-Mumford stack \cX over an algebraic space S, and a locally finitely-presented \OO_{\cX}-module \cF, we prove that the Quot functor \text{Quot}(\cF/\cX/S) is represented by a separated and locally finitely-presented algebraic space over S. Under additional hypotheses, we prove that the connected components of \text{Quot}(\cF/\cX/S) are quasi-projective over S.
