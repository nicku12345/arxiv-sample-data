Generalizing a question of Mukai, we conjecture that a Fano manifold X with Picard number \rho_X and pseudo-index \iota_X satisfies \rho_X (\iota_X-1) \le \dim(X). We prove this inequality in several situations: X is a Fano manifold of dimension \le 4, X is a toric Fano manifold of dimension \le 7 or X is a toric Fano manifold of arbitrary dimension with \iota_X \ge \dim(X)/3+1. Finally, we offer a new approach to the general case.
