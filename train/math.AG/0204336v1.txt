Using currents with minimal singularities, we construct pointwise minimal multiplicities for a real pseudo-effective (1,1)-class \alpha on a compact complex n-fold   X, which are the local obstructions to the numerical effectivity of \alpha. The negative part of \alpha is then defined as the real effective divisor N(\alpha) whose multiplicity along a prime divisor D is just the generic multiplicity of \alpha along D, and we get in that way a divisorial Zariski decomposition of \alpha into the sum of a class Z(\alpha) which is nef in codimension 1 and the class of its negative part N(\alpha), which is exceptional in the sense that it is very rigidly embedded in X. The positive parts Z(\alpha) generate a modified nef cone, and the pseudo-effective cone is shown to be locally polyhedral away from the modified nef cone, with extremal rays generated by exceptional divisors. We then treat the case of a surface and a hyper-K\"ahler manifold in some detail: under the intersection form (resp. the   Beauville-Bogomolov form), we characterize the modified nef cone and the exceptional divisors; our divisorial Zariski decomposition is orthogonal, and is thus a rational decomposition, which fact accounts for the usual existence statement of a Zariski decomposition on a projective surface, which is thus extended to the hyper-K\"ahler case. Finally, we explain how the divisorial Zariski decomposition of (the first Chern class of) a big line bundle on a projective manifold can be characterized in terms of the asymptotics of the linear series |kL| as k\to\infty.
