Let H be a semisimple algebaric group and let X be a smooth projective curve defined over an algebraically closed field k. In the first part of this paper we show that the moduli of semistable principal H-bundles exists once given a "low-height" representation of H. We also show the projectivity of the moduli space if p > \psi, where \psi is a representation theoritic index. The projectivity is a consequence of a semistable reduction theorem. The irreducibility of the moduli space of semistable H-bundles for simple and simply connected group is obtained as a consequence.
