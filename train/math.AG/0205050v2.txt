Local models are schemes defined in terms of linear algebra which can be used to study the local structure of integral models of certain Shimura varieties, with parahoric level structure. We investigate the local models for groups of the form Res_{F/\Q_p} GL_n and Res_{F/\Q_p} GSp_2g where F/Q_p is a totally ramified extension, as defined by Pappas and Rapoport, and show that they are topologically flat. In the linear case, flatness can be deduced from this.
