We prove two formulae which express the Alexander polynomial \Delta^C of several variables of a plane curve singularity C in terms of the ring {\cal O}_{C} of germs of analytic functions on the curve. One of them expresses \Delta^C in terms of dimensions of some factors corresponding to a (multi-indexed) filtration on the ring {\cal O}_{C}. The other one gives the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial \Delta^C as Euler characteristics of some explicitly described spaces (complements to arrangements of projective hyperplanes). The final version of this article will be published in the Duke Mathematical Journal.
