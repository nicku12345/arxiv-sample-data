Let f:X\to C be a family of semistable K3 surfaces with non-empty set S of singular fibres having infinite local monodromy. Then, when the so called Arakelov-Yau inequality reaches equality, we prove that C\setminus S is a modular curve and the family comes essentially from a family of elliptic curves through a so called Nikulin-Kummer construction. In particular, when C=\BBb P^1, the family of elliptic curves must be one of Beauville's 6 examples where Arakelov inequality reaches equality.
