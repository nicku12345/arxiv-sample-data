Let X/S be a semistable curve with an action of a finite group G and let H be a normal subgroup of G. We present a new condition under which for any base change T->S, (X/G)*T is isomorphic to (X*T)/G. This allows us to define induction and restriction morphisms between the G-equivariant deformation functor of X and the   G/H-equivariant (resp. H-equivariant) deformation functor of X/H (resp. X).
