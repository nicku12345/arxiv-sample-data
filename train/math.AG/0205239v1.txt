We study infinite intersections of open subschemes and the corresponding intersection of Hilbert schemes. If \{U_i\} is the collection of open subschemes of a variety X containing a fixed point P, then we show that the Hilbert functor of flat and finite families on the spectrum of the local ring of P is given by the intersection of {\Cal H}_i, where {\Cal H}_i is the Hilbert functor of flat and finite families on U_i. In particular we show that the Hilbert functor of flat and finite families on the spectrum of the local ring of P is representable by a scheme.
