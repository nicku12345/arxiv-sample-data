For a Fano manifold M, complex conjugation defines a real involution on the quantum cohomology ring. For the Grassmannian we identify this involution with an explicit transformation on Schubert classes defined over the integers. It is a composition of a power of the cyclic action recently defined by Agnihotri and Woodward with Poincare duality. The existence of the involution has been observed independently and from a different point of view by Postnikov (math.CO/0205165).
