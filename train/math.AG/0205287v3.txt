Let X and Y be smooth projective varieties over \mathbb{C}. They are called {\it D-equivalent} if their derived categories of bounded complexes of coherent sheaves are equivalent as triangulated categories, while {\it K-equivalent} if they are birationally equivalent and the pull-backs of their canonical divisors to a common resolution coincide. We expect that the two equivalences coincide at least for birationally equivalent varieties. We shall provide a partial answer to the above problem in this paper.
