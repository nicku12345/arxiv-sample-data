Let C be a curve of genus g\geq 2. A coherent system on C consists of a pair (E,V) where E is an algebraic vector bundle of rank n and degree d and V is a subspace of dimension k of sections of E. The stability of the coherent systems depend on a parameter \tau. We study the variation of the moduli space of coherent systems when we move the parameter. As an application, we analyse the cases k=1,2,3 and n=2 explicitly. For small values of \tau, the moduli space of coherent systems is related to the Brill-Noether loci, the subspaces of the moduli space of stable bundles consisting of those bundles with a prescribed number of sections. The study of coherent systems is applied to find the dimension, irreducibility, and in some cases, the Picard group, of the Brill-Noether loci with k\leq 3.
