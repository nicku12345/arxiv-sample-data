Let X be a Gorenstein minimal projective 3-fold with at worst locally factorial terminal singularities. Suppose the canonical map is of fiber type. Denote by F a smooth model of a generic irreducible component in fibers of the canonical map of X and so F is a smooth curve or a smooth surface. The main result of the paper is that there is a computable constant K (independent of X) such that g(F)\leq 647 or p_g(F)\leq 38 whenever p_g(X)\geq K. The method heavily relies on both a Noether type of inequality and a Miyaoka-Yau inequality and that is the reason we only treat a Gorenstein object here.   It is open whether the degree of the canonical map is universally bounded when the canonical map is generically finite.
