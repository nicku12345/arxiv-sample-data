In this paper we give an explicit formula for the Riemann-Roch map for singular schemes which are quotients of smooth schemes by diagonalizable groups. As an application we obtain a simple proof of a formula for the Todd class of a simplicial toric variety. An equivariant version of this formula was previously obtained for complete simplicial toric varieties by Brion and Vergne using different techniques.
