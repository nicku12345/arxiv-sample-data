Let X be a projective variety which is covered by rational curves, for instance a Fano manifold over the complex numbers. In this setup, characterization and classification problems lead to the natural question: "Given two points on X, how many minimal degree rational curve are there which contain those points?". A recent answer to this question led to a number of new results in classification theory. As an infinitesimal analogue, we ask "How many minimal degree rational curves exist which contain a prescribed tangent vector?"   In this paper, we give sufficient conditions which guarantee that every tangent vector at a general point of X is contained in at most one rational curve minimal degree. As an immediate application, we obtain irreducibility criteria for the space of minimal rational curves.
