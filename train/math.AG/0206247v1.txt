In this paper we prove a general theorem concerning the number of translation classes of curves of genus g belonging to a fixed cohomology class in a polarized abelian variety of dimension g. For g = 2 we recover results of G\"ottsche and Bryan-Leung. For g = 3 we deduce explicit numbers for these classes.
