To any unramified double cover \pi:\tilde C \to C of projective irreducible and nonsingular curves one associates the Prym variety P = P(\pi). For C nonhyperelliptic of genus g \geq 6 we consider the natural embedding \tilde C \subset P (defined up to translation) of \tilde C into P and we study the local structure of the Hilbert scheme Hilb^P of P at the point   [\tilde C]. We show that this structure is related with the local geometry of the Prym map, or more precisely with the validity of the infinitesimal version of Torelli's theorem for Pryms at [\pi]
