We study equivariant projective compactifications of reductive groups obtained by closing the image of a group in the space of operators of a projective representation. We describe the structure and the mutual position of their orbits under the action of the doubled group by left/right multiplications, the local structure in a neighborhood of a closed orbit, and obtain some conditions of normality and smoothness of a compactification. Our methods of research use the theory of equivariant embeddings of spherical homogeneous spaces and of reductive algebraic semigroups.
