We introduce the moduli space R \bar{M}_{2k,l} of pointed real curves of genus zero and give its natural stratification. The strata of R \bar{M}_{2k,l} correspond to real curves of genus zero with different degeneration types and are encoded by their dual trees with certain decorations. By using this stratification, we calculate the first Stiefel-Whitney class of R \bar{M}_{2k,l} and construct the orientation double cover R \widetilde{M}_{2k,l} of R \bar{M}_{2k,l}.
