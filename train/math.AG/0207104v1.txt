In this article we classify all the smooth threefolds of P^5 with an apparent quadruple point provided that the family of its 4-secant lines is an irreducible (first order) congruence. This is sufficient to conclude the classification of all the smooth codimension two varieties of P^n with one apparent (n-1)-point and with irreducible family of (n-1)-secant lines.
