In their proof of the Drinfeld-Langlands correspondence, Frenkel, Gaitsgory and Vilonen make use of a geometric Fourier transformation. Therefore, they work either with l-adic sheaves in characteristic p>0, or with D-modules in characteristic 0. Actually, they only need to consider the Fourier transforms of homogeneous sheaves for which one expects a uniform geometric construction in any characteristic.   In this note, we propose such a homogeneous geometric Fourier transformation. It extends the geometric Radon transformation which has been studied by Brylinski.
