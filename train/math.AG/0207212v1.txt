We consider suspension hypersurface singularities of type g=f(x,y)+z^n, where f is an irreducible plane curve singularity. For such germs, we prove that the link of g determines completely the Newton pairs of f and the integer n except for two pathological cases, which can be completely described. Even in the pathological cases, the link and the Milnor number of g determine uniquely the Newton pairs of f and n. In particular, for such g, we verify Zariski's conjecture about the multiplicity. The result also supports the following conjecture formulated in the paper. If the link of an isolated hypersurface singularity is a rational homology 3-sphere then it determines the embedded topological type, the equivariant Hodge numbers and the multiplicity of the singularity. The conjecture is verified for weighted homogeneous singularities too.
