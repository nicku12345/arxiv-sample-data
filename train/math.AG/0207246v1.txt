A Mumford curve of genus g=5,6,7 or 8 over a non-archimedean field of characteristic p (such that if p=0, the residue field characteristic exceeds 5) has at most 12(g-1) automorphisms. In this paper, all curves that attain this bound and their automorphism groups (called of Lame type) are explicitly determined.
