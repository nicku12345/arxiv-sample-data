We exhibit a direct correspondence between the potential defining the H^{1,1} small quantum module structure on the cohomology of a Calabi-Yau manifold and the asymptotic data of the A-model variation of Hodge structure. This is done in the abstract context of polarized variations of Hodge structure and Frobenius modules.
