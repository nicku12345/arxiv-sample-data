A scheme X\subset \PP^{n+c} of codimension c is called {\em standard determinantal} if its homogeneous saturated ideal can be generated by the maximal minors of a homogeneous t \times (t+c-1) matrix and X is said to be {\em good determinantal} if it is standard determinantal and a generic complete intersection. Given integers a_0,a_1,...,a_{t+c-2} and b_1,...,b_t we denote by W(\underline{b};\underline{a})\subset \Hi ^p(\PP^{n+c}) (resp. W_s(\underline{b};\underline{a})) the locus of good (resp. standard) determinantal schemes X\subset \PP^{n+c} of codimension c defined by the maximal minors of a t\times (t+c-1) matrix (f_{ij})^{i=1,...,t}_{j=0,...,t+c-2} where f_{ij}\in k[x_0,x_1,...,x_{n+c}] is a homogeneous polynomial of degree a_j-b_i.   In this paper we address the following three fundamental problems : To determine (1) the dimension of W(\underline{b};\underline{a}) (resp. W_s(\underline{b};\underline{a})) in terms of a_j and b_i, (2) whether the closure of W(\underline{b};\underline{a}) is an irreducible component of \Hi ^p(\PP^{n+c}), and (3) when \Hi ^p(\PP^{n+c}) is generically smooth along W(\underline{b};\underline{a}). Concerning question (1) we give an upper bound for the dimension of W(\underline{b};\underline{a}) (resp. W_s(\underline{b};\underline{a})) which works for all integers a_0,a_1,...,a_{t+c-2} and b_1,...,b_t, and we conjecture that this bound is sharp. The conjecture is proved for 2\le c\le 5, and for c\ge 6 under some restriction on a_0,a_1,...,a_{t+c-2} and b_1,...,b_t. For questions (2) and (3) we have an affirmative answer for 2\le c \le 4 and n\ge 2, and for c\ge 5 under certain numerical assumptions.
