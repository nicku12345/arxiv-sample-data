Let A be a regular 2-dimensional local ring of characteristic p>0, and let L/K be a cyclic extension of degree p of its field of fractions such that the corresponding branch divisor is normal crossing. For each \gp\in\Spec A of height 1 such that A/\gp is regular, consider the ramification jump h_\gp of the extension of the residue field at \gp. In this paper the semi-continuity of h_\gp with respect to Zariski topology of suitable jet spaces is proved. The asymptotic of h_\gp with respect to intersection multiplicity of the prime divisor defined by \gp and the branch divisor is also addressed.
