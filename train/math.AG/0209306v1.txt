Let X be a smooth contractible affine algebraic threefold with a nontrivial algebraic {\bf C}_+-action on it. We show that X is rational and the algebraic quotient X//{\bf C}_+ is a smooth contractible surface S which is isomorphic to {\bf C}^2 in the case when X admits a dominant morphism from a threefold of form C \times {\bf C}^2. Furthermore, if the action is free then X is isomorphic to S \times {\bf C} and the action is induced by translation on the second factor. In particular, we have the following criterion: if a smooth contractible affine algebraic threefold X with a free algebraic {\bf C}_+-action admits a dominant morphism from C\times {\bf C}^2 then X is isomorphic to {\bf C}^3.
