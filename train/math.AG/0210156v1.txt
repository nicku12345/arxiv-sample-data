Let X \subseteq {\bf P}^N ={\bf P}^{2n}_K be a subvariety of dimension n and P \in {\bf P}^N a generic point. If the tangent variety Tan X is equal to {\bf P}^N then for generic points x, y of X the projective tangent spaces t_xX and t_yX meet in one point P=P(x,y). The main result of this paper is that the rational map (x,y)\mapsto P(x,y) is dominant. In other words, a generic point P is uniquely determined by the ramification locus R(\pi_P) of the linear projection \pi_P:X\to {\bf P}^{N-1}.
