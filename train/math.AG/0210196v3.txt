Let \mathcal{M}_{g,2} be the moduli space of curves of genus g with a level-2 structure. We prove here that there is always a non hyperelliptic element in the intersection of four thetanull divisors in \mathcal{M}_{6,2}. We prove also that for all g\geqslant3, each component of the hyperelliptic locus in \mathcal{M}_{g,2} is a connected component of the intersection of g-2 thetanull divisors.
