Given a family X/B of nodal curves, we construct canonically and compatibly with base-change, via an explicit blow-up of the Cartesian product X^r/B, a family W^r(X/B) parametrizing length-r subschemes of fibres of X/B (plus some additional data). Though W^r(X/B) is singular, the important sheaves on it are locally free, which allows us to study intersection theory on it and deduce enumerative applications, including some relative multiple point formulae, enumerating the length-r schemes contained simultaneously in some fibre of X/B and some fibre of a given map from X to a smooth variety.
