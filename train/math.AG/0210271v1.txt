For a birational analogue of minimal elliptic surfaces X/Y, the singularities of the fibers define a log structure in codimension one on Y. Via base change, we have a log structure in codimension one on Y', for any birational model Y' of Y. We show that these codimension one log structures glue to a unique log structure, defined on some birational model of Y (Shokurov's BP Conjecture). We have three applications: inverse of adjunction for the above mentioned fiber spaces, the invariance of Shokurov's FGA-algebras under restriction to exceptional lc centers, and a remark on the moduli part of parabolic fiber spaces.
