In this note we discuss a class of hyperelliptic curves introduced by Abel in a 1826 paper. After some indications of the context in which he introduced them and a description of his main result we give some results on the moduli space of such curves.   In particular we compute the dimension of it at each of its points as well as giving a combinatorial formula for the number of components.
