We extend some of the results obtained for subvarieties of the moduli stack of canonically polarized manifolds in "Base spaces of non-isotrivial families of smooth minimal models" (math.AG/0103122) to moduli of polarized minimal models of Kodaira dimension zero. To this aim we first show that for those manifolds there are no non isotrivial families of minimal models, which are birationally isotrivial. In the last chapter, we discuss the rigidity of curves in the moduli stack of canonically polarized manifolds and of polarized minimal models of Kodaira dimension zero.
