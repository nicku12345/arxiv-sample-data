We provide a Hilbert-Mumford Criterion for actions of reductive groups G on Q-factorial complex varieties. The result allows to construct open subsets admitting a good quotient by G from certain maximal open subsets admitting a good quotient by a maximal torus of G. As an application, we show how to obtain all invariant open subsets with good quotient for a given G-action on a complete Q-factorial toric variety.
