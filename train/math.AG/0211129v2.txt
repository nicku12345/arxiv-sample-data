In this paper we show that there is a correspondence between some K3 surfaces with non-isometric transcendental lattices constructed as a twist of the transcendental lattice of the Jacobian of a generic genus 2 curve. Moreover, we show the existence of a correspondence between a general K3 surface with \rho =17 and a Kummer surface having transcendental lattices \QQ-Hodge isomorphic.
