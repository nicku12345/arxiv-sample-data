We consider real monic {\em hyperbolic} polynomials in one real variable, i.e. polynomials having only real roots. Call {\em hyperbolicity domain} \Pi of the family of polynomials P(x,a)=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+... +a_n, a_i,x\in {\bf R}, the set \{a\in {\bf R}^n| P is hyperbolic \}. The paper studies a stratification of \Pi defined by the arrangement of the roots of P and P^{(k)}, where 2\leq k\leq n-1. We prove that the strata are smooth contractible real algebraic varieties.
