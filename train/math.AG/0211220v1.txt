In continuation of our work in Comm. in Algebra, vol. 28 (2000), we study ramified coverings of projective manifolds, in particular over Fano manifolds and investigate positivity properties of the associated vector bundle. Moreover we study the topology of low degree coverings and the structure of the ramification divisor.
