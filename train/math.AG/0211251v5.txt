We study the canonical stability of a smooth projective 3-fold V of general type. We prove that   (1) |5K_V| gives a birational map onto its image provided the geometric genus p_g\geq 4;   (2) |6K_V| gives a birational map provided p_g=3.   Known examples show that both are optimal. This fact can be viewed as parallel to surface case, though people know very little on 3-folds of general type with p_g\leq 1.
