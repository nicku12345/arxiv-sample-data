We describe a multivariable polynomial invariant for certain class of non isolated hypersurface singularities generalizing the characteristic polynomial on monodromy. The starting point is an extension of a theorem due to Le Dung Trang and K.Saito on commutativity of the local fundamental groups of certain hypersurfaces. The description of multivariable polynomial invariants is given in terms of the ideals and polytopes of quasiadjunction generalizing corresponding data used in the study of the homotopy groups of the complements to projective hypersurfaces and Alexander invariants of plane reducible curves.
