Let \mathcal D_{d,k} denote the discriminant variety of degree d polynomials in one variable with at least one of its roots being of multiplicity \geq k. We prove that the tangent cones to \mathcal D_{d,k} span \mathcal D_{d,k-1} thus, revealing an extreme ruled nature of these varieties. The combinatorics of the web of affine tangent spaces to \mathcal D_{d,k} in \mathcal D_{d,k-1} is directly linked to the root multiplicities of the relevant polynomials. In fact, solving a polynomial equation P(z) = 0 turns out to be equivalent to finding hyperplanes through a given point P(z)\in \mathcal D_{d,1} \approx \A^d which are tangent to the discriminant hypersurface \mathcal D_{d,2}. We also connect the geometry of the Vi\`{e}te map \mathcal V_d: \A^d_{root} \to \A^d_{coef}, given by the elementary symmetric polynomials, with the tangents to the discriminant varieties \{\mathcal D_{d,k}\}.   Various d-partitions \{\mu\} provide a refinement \{\mathcal D_\mu^\circ\} of the stratification of \A^d_{coef} by the \mathcal D_{d,k}'s. Our main result, Theorem 7.1, describes an intricate relation between the divisibility of polynomials in one variable and the families of spaces tangent to various strata \{\mathcal D_\mu^\circ\}.
