This work makes a parallel construction for curves on threefolds to a ``current-theoretic'' proof of Abel's theorem giving the rational equivalence of divisors P and Q on a Riemann surface when Q - P is (equivalent to) zero in the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface. The parallel construction is made for homologous ''sub-canonical'' curves P and Q on a general class of threefolds. If P and Q are algebraically equivalent and Q - P is zero in the (intermediate) Jacobian of a threefold, the construction ''almost'' gives rational equivalence.
