If \P^\infty is the projective ind-space, i.e. \P^\infty is the inductive limit of linear embeddings of complex projective spaces, the Barth-Van de Ven-Tyurin (BVT) Theorem claims that every finite rank vector bundle on \P^\infty is isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles. We extend this theorem to general sequences of morphisms between projective spaces by proving that, if there are infinitely many morphisms of degree higher than one, every vector bundle of finite rank on the inductive limit is trivial. We then establish a relative version of these results, and apply it to the study of vector bundles on inductive limits of grassmannians. In particular we show that the BVT Theorem extends to the ind-grassmannian of subspaces commensurable with a fixed infinite dimensional and infinite codimensional subspace in \C^\infty. We also show that for a class of twisted ind-grassmannians, every finite rank vector bundle is trivial.
