Let the special linear group G := SL_{2} act regularly on a Q-factorial variety X. Consider a maximal torus T \subset G and its normalizer N \subset G. We prove: If U \subset X is a maximal open N-invariant subset admitting a good quotient U \to U // N with a divisorial quotient space, then the intersection W(U) of all translates g \dot U is open in X and admits a good quotient W(U) \to W(U) // G with a divisorial quotient space. Conversely, we obtain that every maximal open G-invariant subset W \subset X admitting a good quotient W \to W // G with a divisorial quotient space is of the form W = W(U) for some maximal open N-invariant U as above.
