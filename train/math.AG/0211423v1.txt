We present a concise proof for the existence and construction of a {\it strong resolution of excellent schemes} of finite type over a field of characteristic zero. Our proof is based on earlier work of Villamayor, Encinas-Villamayor and Bierstone-Milman. It apports some substantial simplifications which may be helpful for a better understanding of how to prove Hironaka's famous theorem.
