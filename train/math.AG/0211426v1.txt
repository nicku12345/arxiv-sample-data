To a given analytic function germ f:(\mathbb{R}^d,0) \to (\mathbb{R},0), we associate zeta functions Z_{f,+}, Z_{f,-} \in \mathbb{Z} [[T]], defined analogously to the motivic zeta functions of Denef and Loeser. We show that our zeta functions are rational and that they are invariants of the blow-analytic equivalence in the sense of Kuo. Then we use them together with the Fukui invariant to classify the blow-analytic equivalence classes of Brieskorn polynomials of two variables. Except special series of singularities our method classifies as well the blow-analytic equivalence classes of Brieskorn polynomials of three variables.
