Let S be a minimal surface of general type with p_g=0 and K^2=6, such that its bicanonical map \fie\colon S\to\pp^6 is not birational. The map \fie is a morphism of degree \le 4 onto a surface. The case of \deg\fie=4 is completely characterized in [Topology, {\bf 40} (5)   (2001), 977--991] and the present paper completes the classification of these surfaces. It is proven that the degree of \fie cannot be equal to 3, and the geometry of surfaces with \deg\fie=2 is analysed in detail. The last section contains three examples of such surfaces, two of which appear to be new.
