We extend the theory of generalized divisors so as to work on any scheme X satisfying the condition S_2 of Serre. We define a generalized notion of Gorenstein biliaison for schemes in projective space. With this we give a new proof in a stronger form of the theorem of Gaeta, that standard determinantal schemes are in the Gorenstein biliaison class of a complete intersection.   We also show, for schemes of codimension three in {\mathbb P}^n, that the relation of Gorenstein biliaison is equivalent to the relation of even strict Gorenstein liaison.
