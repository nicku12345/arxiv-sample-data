We characterize the postulation character of arithmetically Gorenstein curves in {\mathbb P}^4. We give conditions under which the curve can be realized in the form mH-K on some ACM surface. Finally, we strengthen a theorem of Watanabe by showing that any general arithmetically Gorenstein curve in {\mathbb P}^4 can be obtained from a line by a series of ascending complete-intersection biliaisons.
