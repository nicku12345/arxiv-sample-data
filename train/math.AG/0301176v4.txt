Let G be an almost simple simply connected group over \BC, and let \Bun^a_G(\BP^2,\BP^1) be the moduli scheme of principal G-bundles on the projective plave \BP^2, of second Chern class a, trivialized along a line \BP^1\subset \BP^2.   We define the Uhlenbeck compactification \fU^a_G of \Bun^a_G(\BP^2,\BP^1), which classifies, roughly, pairs (\F_G,D), where D is a 0-cycle on \BA^2=\BP^2-\BP^1 of degree b, and \F_G is a point of \Bun^{a-b}_G(\BP^2,\BP^1), for varying b.   In addition, we calculate the stalks of the Intersection Cohomology sheaf of \fU^a_G. To do that we give a geometric realization of Kashiwara's crystals for affine Kac-Moody algebras.
