We describe the weight filtration in the cohomology of toric varieties. We present a role of the Frobenius automorphism in an elementary way. We prove that equivariant intersection homology of an arbitrary toric variety is pure. We obtain results concerning Koszul duality: nonequivariant intersection cohomology is equal to the cohomology of the Koszul complex IH_T^*(X)\otimes H^*(T). We also describe the weight filtration in IH^*(X).
