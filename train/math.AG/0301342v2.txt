In this article we describe three constructions of complex variations of Hodge structure, proving the existence of interesting opposite filtrations that generalize a construction of Deligne. We also analyze the relation between deformations of Frobenius modules and certain maximally degenerate variations of Hodge structures. Finally, under a certain generation hypothesis, we show how to construct a Frobenius manifold starting from a deformation of a Frobenius module.
