We prove the Green conjecture for generic curves of odd genus. That is we prove the vanishing K_{k,1}(X,K_X)=0 for X generic of genus 2k+1. The curves we consider are smooth curves X on a K3 surface whose Picard group has rank 2. This completes our previous work, where the Green conjecture for generic curves of genus g with fixed gonality d was proved in the range d\geq g/3, with the possible exception of the generic curves of odd genus.
