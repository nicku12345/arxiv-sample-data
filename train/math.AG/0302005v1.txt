We show that for every morphism f between nonsingular hypersurfaces of dimension at least 3 and of general type in projective space, there is an everywhere defined endomorphism F of projective space that restricts to f.   As a corollary, we see that if X,Y are nonsingular hypersurfaces of general type of dimension at least 3 such that there is a nonconstant morphism f from X to Y, then degY divides degX with quotient q, and moreover the endomorphism F of projective space is given by polynomials of degree q.
