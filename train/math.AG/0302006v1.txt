We show that every morphism from a degree 5 hypersurface in 4-dimensional projective space to a nonsingular degree 3 hypersurface in 4-dimensional projective space is necessarily constant. In the process, we also classify morphisms from the projective plane to nonsingular cubic threefolds given by degree 3 polynomials.
