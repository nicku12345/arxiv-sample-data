Let X\subset \P^n be a possibly singular hypersurface of degree d\le n, defined over a finite field k. We show that the diagonal, suitably interpreted, is decomposable. This gives a proof that the eigenvalues of the Frobenius action on its \ell-adic cohomology H^i(\bar{X}, \Q_\ell), for \ell \neq {\rm char}(k), are divisible by q, without using the result on the existence of rational points by Ax and Katz.
