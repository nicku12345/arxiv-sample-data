Combining the idea of motivic zeta function, due to Kapranov, and Pellikaan's definition of a two- variable zeta function for curves over finite fields in the present note we introduce a motivic two- variable zeta function for curves over arbitrary fields and prove the generalizations of Pellikaan's results in this context.
