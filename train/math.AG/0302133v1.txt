Let C be a smooth complex projective curve of genus at least 2 and let M be the moduli space of rank 2, stable vector bundles on C, with fixed determinant of degree 1. For any k>1, we find two irreducible components of the space of rational curves of degree k on M. One component, which we call the nice component has the property that the general element is a very free curve if k is sufficiently large. The other component has the general element a free curve. Both components have the expected dimension and their maximal rationally connected fibration is the Jacobian of the curve C.
