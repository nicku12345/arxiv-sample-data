We study A_{\infty}-structures extending the natural algebra structure on the cohomology of \oplus_n L^n, where L is a very ample line bundle on a projective d-dimensional variety X such that H^i(X,L^n)=0 for 0<i<d and all n. We prove that there exists a unique such nontrivial A_{\infty}-structure up to homotopy and rescaling. In the case when X is a curve we also compute the group of self-homotopies of this A_{\infty}-structure.
