Let X be a smooth projective connected curve of genus g \ge 2 and let I be a finite set of points of X. Fix a parabolic structure on I for rank r vector bundles on X. Let M^{par} denote the moduli space of parabolic semistable bundles and let L^{par} denote the parabolic determinant bundle. In this paper we show that the n-th tensor power line bundle {L^{par}}^n on the moduli space M^{par} is globally generated, as soon as the integer n is such that n \ge [\frac{r^2}{4}]. In order to get this bound, we construct a parabolic analogue of the Quot scheme and extend the result of Popa and Roth on the estimate of its dimension.
