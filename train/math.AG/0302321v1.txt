In 1985 Xiao Gang proved that the bicanonical system of a complex surface S of general type with p_2(S)>2 is not composed of a pencil [Bull. Soc. Math. France, 113 (1985), 23--51]. When in the end of the 80's it was finally proven that | 2K_S| is base point free, whenever p_g\geq 1, the part of this theorem concerning surfaces with p_g\geq 1 became trivial.   In this note a new proof of this theorem for surfaces with p_g=0 is presented.
