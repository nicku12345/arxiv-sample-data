Let {\mathfrak g} be a simple Lie algebra. For a level \kappa (thought of as a symmetric {\mathfrak g}-invariant form of {\mathfrak g}), let \hat{\mathfrak g}_\kappa be the corresponding affine Kac-Moody algebra.   Let Gr_G be the affine Grassmannian of {\mathfrak g}, and let D_\kappa(Gr_G)-mod be the category of \kappa-twisted right D-modules on Gr_G. By taking global sections of a D-module, we obtain a functor \Gamma:D_\kappa(Gr_G)-mod\to {\mathfrak g}_\kappa-mod. It is known that this functor is exact and faithful when \kappa is negative or irrational.   In this paper, we show that the functor \Gamma is exact and faithful also when \kappa is the critical level.
