For a stable irreducible curve X and a torsion free sheaf L on X of rank one and degree d, D.S. Nagaraj and C.S. Seshadri ([NS]) defined a closed subset \Cal U_X(r,L) in the moduli space of semistable torsion free sheaves of rank r and degree d on X. We prove that \Cal U_X(r,L) is irreducible, when a smooth curve Y specializes to X and a line bundle \Cal L on Y specializes to L, the specialization of moduli space of semistable rank r vector bundles on Y with fixed determinant \Cal L has underlying set \Cal U_X(r,L). For rank 2 and 3, we show that there is a Cohen-Macaulay closed subscheme in the Gieseker space which represents a suitable moduli functor and has good specialization property.
