In the paper "Algebraic classification of rational CR structures on topological 5-sphere with transversal holomorphic S^1-action in C^4" (Yau and Yu, Math. Nachrichten 246-247(2002), 207-233), we give algebraic classification of rational CR structures on the topological 5-sphere with transversal holomorphic S^1-action in C^4. Here, algebraic classification of compact strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds X means classification up to algebraic equivalence, i.e. roughly up to isomorphism of the normalization of the complex analytic variety V which has X as boundary. The problem is intimately related to the study of 3-dimensional isolated rational weighted homogeneous hypersurface singularities with link homeomorphic to S^5. For this, we need the classification of 3-dimensional isolated rational hypersurface singularities with a C*-action. This list is only available at the homepage of one of us. Since there is a desire for a complete list of this classification (cf. Theorem 3.3), we decide to publish it for the convenience of readers.
