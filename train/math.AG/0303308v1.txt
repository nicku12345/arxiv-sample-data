The main purpose of this paper is twofold. We first want to analyze in details the meaningful geometric aspect of the method introduced in the previous paper [12], concerning regularity of families of irreducible, nodal "curves" on a smooth, projective threefold X. This analysis highlights several fascinating connections with families of other singular geometric "objects" related to X and to other varieties.   Then, we generalize this method to study similar problems for families of singular divisors on ruled fourfolds suitably related to X.
