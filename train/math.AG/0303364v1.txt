Let G\subset SO(4) denote a finite subgroup containing the Heisenberg group. In these notes we classify all these groups, we find the dimension of the spaces of G-invariant polynomials and we give equations for the generators whenever the space has dimension two. Then we complete the study of the corresponding G-invariant pencils of surfaces in \mathbb{P}_3 which we started in math. AG/0106080. It turns out that we have five more pencils, two of them containing surfaces with nodes.
