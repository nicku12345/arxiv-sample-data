We study Calabi-Yau manifolds constructed as double covers of {\mathbb P}^3 branched along an octic surface. We give a list of 85 examples corresponding to arrangements of eight planes defined over {\mathbb Q}. The Hodge numbers are computed for all examples. There are 7 rigid Calabi-Yau manifolds and 14 families with h^{1,2}=1. The modularity conjecture is verified for all the rigid examples.
