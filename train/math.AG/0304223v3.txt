In the late 50's A. Van de Ven stated that the only compact submanifolds with splitting tangent sequence of the projective space are linear subspaces. In this paper a classification of all submanifolds with splitting tangent sequence of some further classes of (homogeneous) manifolds is given, like quadrics or abelian varieties.
