Let BG be a classifying variety for an exceptional simple simply connected algebraic group G. We compute the degree 3 unramified Galois cohomology of BG with values in Q/Z(2) over an arbitrary field F. Combined with a paper by Merkurjev, this completes the computation of these cohomology groups for G semisimple simply connected over all fields.   These computations provide another example of a simple simply connected group G such that BG is not stably rational.
