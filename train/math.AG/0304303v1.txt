A K3 surface is a quaternionic analogue of an elliptic curve from a view point of moduli of vector bundles. We can prove the algebraicity of certain Hodge cycles and a rigidity of curve of genus eleven and gives two kind of descriptions of Fano threefolds as applications. In the final section we discuss a simplified construction of moduli spaces.
