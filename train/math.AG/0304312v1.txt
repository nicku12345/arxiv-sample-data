Given a positive singular hermitian metric of a pseudoeffective line bundle on a complex Kaehler manifold, a singular foliation is constructed satisfying certain analytic analogues of numerical conditions. This foliation refines Tsuji's numerically trivial fibration and the Iitaka fibration. Using almost positive singular hermitian metrics with analytic singularities on a pseudo-effective line bundle, a foliation is constructed refining the nef fibration. If the singularities of the foliation are isolated points, the codimension of the leaves is an upper bound to the numerical dimension of the line bundle, and the foliation can be interpreted as a geometric reason for the deviation of nef and Kodaira-Iitaka dimension. Several surface examples are studied in more details, \mathbb{P}^2 blown up in 9 points giving a counter example to equality of numerical dimension and codimension of the leaves.
