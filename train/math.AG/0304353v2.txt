Given a birational modification X \to Y of complex projective varieties with fiber dimension 1 and rational singularities, consider the main component of Bridgeland's moduli space W \to Y of perverse point sheaves on X/Y. We give criteria for the normalization of W to coincide with the transform (flip/flop) X^+ \to Y of X \to Y. First, this holds if the exceptional loci of X \to Y and W \to Y have codimension >1. Second, if the ideal sheaf of X \times_Y X^+ is flat over X^+ then there is at least a morphism X^+ \to W. We illustrate the results using a number of examples, including surface modifications and standard Francia flips.
