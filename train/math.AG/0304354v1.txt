We consider two cases of birational transformations of Q-Gorenstein threefolds: the case of a terminal flop and the case of a Francia flip.   In the first case we show that, if one replaces the threefolds by their canonical covering stacks, the the flop coincides with the moduli stack of perverse point sheaves. This adds to a result of Kawamata showing the derived equivalence. Our construction has the drawback that the moduli space is defined using a presentation of the stack.   In the second case we show that, if one takes a Francia flip X \to Y and replaces X by its canonical covering stack, then the flip coincides with a version of Bridgelan'd moduli space of pewrverse point sheaves involving a new perversity. This adds to another result of Kawamata. Again there is a drawback - the proof of the result relies on the existence of the flip, in contrast with the results of Bridgeland and of Chen where the relevant flop appears as an outcome of the construction.
