In a previous paper we have constructed a compactification KGl_n of the general linear group Gl_n, which in many respects is analogous to the so called wonderful compactification of adjoint semisimple algebraic groups as studied by De Concini and Procesi. In particular there is an action of G=Gl_n\times Gl_n on this compactification. In this paper we show how the space of global section of an arbitrary G-linearized line bundle on KGl_n decomposes canonically into a direct sum of simple G-modules which are themselves given as the spaces of global sections of line bundles on the product of two copies of the full flag manifold parametrizing flags in an n-dimensional vector space.
