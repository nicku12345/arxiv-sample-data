In this paper I present a new geometric approach to the factorization rule for generalised theta functions.   Let X be an irreducible projective nodal curve with one singularity and let Y be its normalization. Recently I have constructed the moduli stack GVB(X) of rank n Gieseker vector bundles on X and have shown that its normalization is a locally trivial fibration over the moduli stack VB(Y) of vector bundles on Y, where the fibre is a canonical compactification of Gl_n. In this paper I prove a canonical direct sum decomposition of the space of global sections of a power of the theta line bundle on GVB(X) where the summands are spaces of global sections of certain line bundles on the moduli stack of parabolic bundles on the two-pointed curve Y.
