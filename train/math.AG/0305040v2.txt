The fundamental property of Fano varieties with mild singularities is that they have a finite polyhedral Mori cone. Thus, it is very interesting to ask: What we can say about algebraic varieties with a finite polyhedral Mori cone? I give a review of known results.   All of them were obtained applying methods which were originated in the theory of discrete groups generated by reflections in hyperbolic spaces with a fundamental chamber of finite volume.   This is my report on Fano conference in Torino, October 2002
