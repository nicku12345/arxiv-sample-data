This paper is a sequel to math.AG/0203287. A generalization of the Mukai flop has been studied by E. Markman. Here we call it a stratified Mukai flop. In this paper, we observe that, for a stratified Mukai flop: X \to \bar{X} \leftarrow X^+, the fiber product X \times_{\bar{X}}X^+ defines an isomorphism of Grothendieck groups K(X) \to K(X^+), but, at the level of derived categories, the fiber product does not generally give an equivalence.
