Refinements of the Yang-Mills stratifications of spaces of connections over a compact Riemann surface are investigated. The motivation for this study was the search for a complete set of relations between the standard generators for the cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable holomorphic bundles of rank n and degree d when n and d are coprime and n>2.
