In this short note, we consider the conjecture that the log canonical divisor (resp. the anti-log canonical divisor) K_X + \Delta (resp. -(K_X + \Delta)) on a pair (X, \Delta) consisting of a complex projective manifold X and a reduced simply normal crossing divisor \Delta on X is ample if it is numerically positive. More precisely, we prove the conjecture for K_X + \Delta with \Delta \neq 0 in dimension 4 and for -(K_X + \Delta) with \Delta \neq 0 in dimension 3 or 4.
