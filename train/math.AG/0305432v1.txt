For a hypersurface in complex projective space X\subset \PP^n, we investigate the singularities and Kodaira dimension of the Kontsevich moduli spaces \Kbm{0,0}{X,e} parametrizing rational curves of degree e on X. If d+e \leq n and X is a general hypersurface of degree d, we prove that \Kbm{0,0}{X,e} has only canonical singularities and we conjecture the same is true for the coarse moduli space \kbm{0,0}{X,e}.This investigation is motivated by the question of which Fano hypersurfaces are unirational.
