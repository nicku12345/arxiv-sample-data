We give a geometric proof of the Decomposition Theorem of Beilinson, Bernstein, Deligne and Gabber for the direct image of the intersection cohomology complex under a proper map of complex algebraic varieties. The method rests on new Hodge-theoretic results on the cohomology of projective varieties which extend naturally the classical theory and provide new applications.
