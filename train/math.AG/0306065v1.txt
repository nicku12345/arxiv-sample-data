We complete the explicit study of a three-fold divisorial contraction whose exceptional divisor contracts to a point, by treating the case where the point downstairs is a singularity of index n \ge 2. We prove that if this singularity is of type cA/n then any such contraction is a suitable weighted blow-up; and that if otherwise then the discrepancy is 1/n with a few exceptions. Every such exception has an example. Some exceptions allow the discrepancy to be arbitrarily large, but any contraction in this case is described as a weighted blow-up of a singularity of type cD/2 embedded into a cyclic quotient of a smooth five-fold. The erratum to the previous paper [14] is attached.
