We prove the uniqueness of crepant resolutions for some quotient singularities and for some nilpotent orbits. The finiteness of non-isomorphic symplectic resolutions for 4-dimenensional symplectic singularities is proved. We also give an example of symplectic singularity which admits two non-equivalent symplectic resolutions.
