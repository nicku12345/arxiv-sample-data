Let K be a finite extension of Q_p and X a smooth projective variety over K. We define the notion of totally degenerate reduction of such an X and the associated Chow complexes of the special fibre of a suitable regular proper model of X over the ring of integers of K. If X has such reduction, we then show that for all l, the Q_l-adic etale cohomology of X has a filtration whose graded quotients are isomorphic, as Galois modules, to the tensor product of a finite dimensional Q-vector space (with a finite unramified action of Galois) with twists of Q_l by the cyclotomic character.
