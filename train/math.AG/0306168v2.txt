Given a complex analytic function with a one-dimensional critical locus at the origin, we examine the monodromy action on the integral cohomology of the Milnor fiber. We relate this monodromy to that of a generic hyperplane slice through the origin, and to that of a generic hyperplane slice near the origin. We thereby obtain number-theoretic restrictions on the monodromy and on the cohomology of the original Milnor fiber.
