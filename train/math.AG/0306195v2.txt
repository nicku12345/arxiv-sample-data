Let S be a parametric surface in \proj{3} given as the image of \phi: \proj{1} \times \proj{1} \to \proj{3}. This paper will show that the use of syzygies in the form of a combination of moving planes and moving quadrics provides a valid method for finding the implicit equation of S when certain base points are present. This work extends the algorithm provided by Cox for when \phi has no base points, and it is an analogous to some of the results of Bus\'{e}, Cox and D'Andrea for the case when \phi: \proj{2} \to \proj{3} has base points.
