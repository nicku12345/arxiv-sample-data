The_commuting variety_ is the pairs of NxN matrices (X,Y) such that XY = YX. We introduce the_diagonal commutator scheme_, {(X,Y) : XY-YX is diagonal}, which we prove to be a reduced complete intersection, one component of which is the commuting variety. (We conjecture there to be only one other component.)   The diagonal commutator scheme has a flat degeneration to the scheme {(X,Y) : XY lower triangular, YX upper triangular}, which is again a reduced complete intersection, this time with n! components (one for each permutation). The degrees of these components give interesting invariants of permutations.
