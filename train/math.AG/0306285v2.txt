We provide a complete description of normal affine varieties with effective algebraic torus action in terms of what we call proper polyhedral divisors on semiprojective varieties. Our theory extends classical cone constructions of Dolgachev, Demazure and Pinkham to the multigraded case, and it comprises the theory of affine toric varieties.
