In two articles by Barthel, Brasselet, Fieseler and Kaup, and, Bressler and Lunts, a combinatorial theory of intersection cohomology and perverse sheaves has been developed on fans. In the first one, one tried to present everything on an elementary level,using only some commutative algebra and no derived categories. There remained two major gaps:   First of all the Hard Lefschetz Theorem was only conjectured and secondly the intersection product seemed to depend on some non-canonical choices. Meanwhile the Hard Lefschetz theorem has been proved by Karu. The proof relies heavily on the intersection product, since what finally has to be shown are the Hodge-Riemann relations. In fact here again choices enter: The intersection product is induced from the intersection product on some simplicial subdivision via a direct embedding of the corresponding intersection cohomology sheaves, a fact, which makes the argumentation quite involved. In a recent paper by Bressler and Lunts, one shows by a detailed analysis that eventually all possible choices do not affect the definition of the pairing.   Our goal here is the same, but we shall try to follow the spirit of the first cited paper avoiding the formalism of derived categories. For perverse sheaves we define their dual sheaf and check that the intersection cohomology sheaf is self- dual in a natural way.
