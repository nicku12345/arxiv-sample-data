This paper proves the following converse to a theorem of Mumford: Let A be a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension five, whose theta divisor has a unique singular point, and suppose that the multiplicity of the singular point is three. Then A is isomorphic as a principally polarized abelian variety to the intermediate Jacobian of a smooth cubic threefold. The method of proof is to analyze the possible singularities of the theta divisor of A, and eventually to show that A is the Prym variety of a possibly singular plane quintic.
