We collect some properties of the motivic zeta functions and the motivic nearby fiber defined by Denef and Loeser. In particular, we calculate the relative dual of the motivic nearby fiber. We give a candidate for a nearby cycle morphism on the level of Grothendieck groups of varieties using the motivic nearby fiber.
