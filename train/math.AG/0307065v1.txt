We formulate a new theorem giving several necessary and sufficient conditions in order that a surjection of the fundamental group \pi_1(X) of a compact K\"ahler manifold onto the fundamental group \Pi_g of a compact Riemann surface of genus g \geq 2 be induced by a holomorphic map. For instance, it suffices that the kernel be finitely generated.   We derive as a corollary a restriction for a group G, fitting into an exact sequence  1 \ra H \ra G \ra \Pi_g \ra 1, where H is finitely generated, to be the fundamental group of a compact K\"ahler manifold.   Thanks to the extension by Bauer and Arapura of the Castelnuovo de Franchis theorem to the quasi-projective case (more generally, to Zariski open sets of compact K\"ahler manifolds) we first extend the previous result to the non compact case. We are finally able to give a topological characterization of quasi-projective surfaces which are fibred over a (quasi-projective) curve by a proper holomorphic map of maximal rank.
