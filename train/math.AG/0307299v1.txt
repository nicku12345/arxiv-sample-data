Let E be a generic vector bundle of rank r and degree d on a generic curve of genus g. If r'd-rd'=r'(r-r')(g-1), the number of subbundles E' of E of rank r' and degree d' is finite. We present a new method to compute the number of such E' that consists in degenerating the curve to a reducible curve. We obtain very explicit formulae for r'=1 (Oxbury's Theorem) and also in the case r=4, r'=2.
