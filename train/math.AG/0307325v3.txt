In this article we compare different conditions on abelian schemes with real multiplication which occur in the integral models of the Hilbert-Blumenthal Shimura variety considered by Rapoport, Deligne, Pappas and Kottwitz. We show that the models studied by Deligne/Pappas and Kottwitz are isomorphic over Spec Z_(p). We also examine the associated local models and prove that they are equal.
