Let Y be the zero loci of a regular section of a convex vector bundle E over X. We provide a new proof of a conjecture of Cox, Katz and Lee for the virtual class of the genus zero moduli of stable maps to Y. This in turn yields the expected relationship between Gromov-Witten theories of Y and X which together with Mirror Theorems allows for the calculation of enumerative invariants of Y inside of X.
