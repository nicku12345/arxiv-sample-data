Let X be a projective scheme over a noetherian base scheme S, and let F be a coherent sheaf on X. For any coherent sheaf E on X, consider the set-valued contravariant functor Hom_{E,F} on S-schemes, defined by Hom_{E,F}(T) = Hom(E_T,F_T) where E_T and F_T are the pull-backs of E and F to X_T = X\times_S T. A basic result of Grothendieck ([EGA] III 7.7.8, 7.7.9) says that if F is flat over S then Hom_{E,F} is representable for all E. We prove the converse of the above, in fact, we show that if L is a relatively ample line bundle on X over S such that the functor Hom_{L^{-n},F} is representable for infinitely many positive integers n, then F is flat over S. As a corollary, taking X=S, it follows that if F is a coherent sheaf on S then the functor T\mapsto H^0(T, F_T) on the category of S-schemes is representable if and only if F is locally free on S. This answers a question posed by Angelo Vistoli. The techniques we use involve the proof of flattening stratification, together with the methods used in proving the author's earlier result (see arXiv.org/abs/math.AG/0204047) that the automorphism group functor of a coherent sheaf on S is representable if and only if the sheaf is locally free.
