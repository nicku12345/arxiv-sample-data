The purpose of this paper is to prove the following theorem. Let X be a projective normal variety defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and let \Omega_{X}^{1}\to L be a one-dimensional foliation on X. If L\cdot C<0 for all curves C\subset X then either the foliation is regular or else X is a cone over a normal projective variety. This strengthens Wahl's well-known cohomological characterization of the projective space and gives a geometric proof of his results.
