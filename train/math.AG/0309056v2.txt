Let C be a smooth projective curve of genus g\geq 4 over the complex numbers and {\cal SU}^s_C(r,d) be the moduli space of stable vector bundles of rank r with a fixed determinant of degree d. In the projectivized cotangent space at a general point E of {\cal SU}^s_C(r,d), there exists a distinguished hypersurface {\cal S}_E consisting of cotangent vectors with singular spectral curves. In the projectivized tangent space at E, there exists a distinguished subvariety {\cal C}_E consisting of vectors tangent to Hecke curves in {\cal SU}^s_C(r,d) through E. Our main result establishes that the hypersurface {\cal S}_E and the variety {\cal C}_E are dual to each other. As an application of this duality relation, we prove that any surjective morphism {\cal SU}^s_C(r,d) \to {\cal SU}^s_{C'}(r,d), where C' is another curve of genus g, is biregular. This confirms, for   {\cal SU}^s_C(r,d), the general expectation that a Fano variety of Picard number 1, excepting the projective space, has no non-trivial self-morphism and that morphisms between Fano varieties of Picard number 1 are rare. The duality relation also gives simple proofs of the non-abelian Torelli theorem and the result of Kouvidakis-Pantev on the automorphisms of {\cal SU}^s_C(r,d).
