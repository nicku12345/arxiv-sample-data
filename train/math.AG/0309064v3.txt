Working over the complex field and formalizing and sharpening approaches introduced by several authors, we give a method for verifying when a divisor on a blow up of P^2 at general points is nef. The method is useful both theoretically and when doing computer computations. The main application is to obtain significantly improved explicit lower bounds for multipoint Seshadri constants on P^2.
