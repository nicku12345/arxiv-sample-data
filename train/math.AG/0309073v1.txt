In this paper we prove the equivalence of two conjectures on linear systems through fat points on a generic K3 surface. The first conjecture is exactly as Segre conjecture on the projective plane. Whereas the second characterizes such linear system and can be compared to the Gimigliano-Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture.
