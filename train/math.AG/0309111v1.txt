Let X_r be a smooth Del Pezzo surface obtained from \P^2 by blowing up r \leq 8 points in general position. It is well known that for r \in \{3,4,5,6,7,8 \} the Picard group \Pic(X_r) contains a canonical root system R_r \in \{A_2 \times A_1, A_4, D_5, E_6, E_7, E_8 \}. We prove some general properties of the Cox ring of X_r (r \geq 4) and show its similarity to the homogeneous coordinate ring of the orbit of the highest weight vector in some irreducible representation of the algebraic group G associated with the root system R_r.
