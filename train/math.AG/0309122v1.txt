We give the classification of 3-dimensional Bol algebras associated to the trilinears operations (e_2,e_3, e_2)=e_1, (e_2, e_3, e_3)=\pme_2. It turn that for such trilinears operation there exist up to isomorphism and isotopy one family and one exceptional Bol algebras. We describe their corresponding 3-webs.
