We present a collection of algebraic equivalences between tautological cycles on the Jacobian J of a curve, i.e., cycles in the subring of the Chow ring of J generated by the classes of certain standard subvarieties of J. These equivalences are universal in the sense that they hold for all curves of given genus. We show also that they are compatible with the action of the Fourier transform on tautological cycles and compute this action explicitly.
