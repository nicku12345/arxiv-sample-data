We introduce the moduli stack of pointed curves equipped with effective r-spin structures: these are effective divisors D such that rD is a canonical divisor modified at marked points. We prove that this moduli space is smooth and compute its dimension. We also prove that it always contains a component that projects birationally to the locus S^0 in the moduli space of r-spin curves consisting of r-spin structures L such that h^0(L)\neq 0. Finally, we study the relation between the locus S^0 and Witten's virtual top Chern class.
