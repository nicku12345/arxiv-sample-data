Generalizing toric varieties, we introduce toric Deligne-Mumford stacks which correspond to combinatorial data. The main result in this paper is an explicit calculation of the orbifold Chow ring of a toric Deligne-Mumford stack. As an application, we prove that the orbifold Chow ring of the toric Deligne-Mumford stack associated to a simplicial toric variety is a flat deformation of (but is not necessarily isomorphic to) the Chow ring of a crepant resolution.
