Let C be a smooth curve of genus g \geq 2 on \C. Let L be a line bundle on C generated by its global sections and let E_{L} be the dual of the kernel of the evaluation map e_{L}. We are studying here the relation between the stability the fact that the bundle is verifying a condition (R) introduced by Raynaud : we prove that E_{L} is semi stable when C is general. We also prove that E_{L} is verifying (R) when \deg(L) \geq 2g or when L is generic. Finally we prove that for each p in \{2,..., \mathrm{rg}(E_{L})-2\}, if \deg(L) \geq 2g+2 then \Lambda^{p}E_{L} is not verifying (R).
