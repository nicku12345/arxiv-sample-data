Let X be a K3 surface with a polarization H of degree H^2=2rs and with a primitive Mukai vector (r,H,s). The moduli space of sheaves over X with the isotropic Mukai vector (r,H,s) is again a K3 surface Y.   We prove that Y\cong X, if Picard lattice N(X) has an element h_1 with h_1^2=f(r,s), and the pair (H,h_1) satisfies a finite number of congruence conditions modulo N_i(r,s). These conditions are exactly written and are necessary for Y\cong X, if X is general with rk N(X)=2.   Existence of such criterion is surprising and gives some geometric interpretation of elements in N(X) with negative square. We also desribe all divisorial conditions on moduli of (X,H) which imply Y\cong X.   Thus, here we treat in general problems considered in math.AG/0206158, math.AG/0304415, math.AG/0307355 when H.N(X)=Z was assumed. In general, the results are much more complicated and less efficient.
