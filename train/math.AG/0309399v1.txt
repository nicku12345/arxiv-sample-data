We study the dimension of the higher secant varieties X^s of {\Bbb X} = {\Bbb P}^{n_1}\times ...\times {\Bbb P}^{n_t} embedded the morphism given by {\cal O}_{\Bbb X}({a_1,...,a_t}). We call it a {\it Segre-Veronese variety} and the embedding a {\it Segre-Veronese embedding}. In several cases (e.g. for 3 factors {\Bbb P}^{1}, or when s is small) we show that X^s has the expected dimension except for a few cases. A list of examples of defective X^s's is given.
