In this work more questions arise than answers given, for which of course we do not apologize.   The core of this paper is concerned with the construction of a ``constant'' t-structure on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves D(X\times S), with X and S smooth varieties, given a nondegenerate t-structure on D(X) with noetherian heart.   While we believe this construction and the methods involved should be generally useful in studying derived categories, we present here but one application: we prove a valuative criterion for separation and properness for the collection P(1) of stable objects of phase 1 under a numerical, locally finite and noetherian Bridgeland-Douglas stability condition (Z,\cP) on D(X), where X is a smooth projective variety.   As an immediate result, the number of long-exact sequences in the first named author's output is no longer an embarrassment.
