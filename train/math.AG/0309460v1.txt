Suppose \pi : X \to Y is a smooth blow-up along a submanifold Z of Y between complex Fano manifolds X and Y of pseudo-indices i_X and i_Y respectively (recall that i_X is defined by i_X := \min \{-K_X \cdot C | C {is a rational curve of} X\}). We prove that i_X \leq i_Y if 2\dim (Z)< \dim(Y) + i_Y -1 and show that this result is optimal by classifying the ``boundary'' cases. As expected, these results are obtained by studying rational curves on X and Y.
