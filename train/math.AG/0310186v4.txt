We consider symplectic singularities in the sense of A. Beauville as examples of Poisson schemes. Using Poisson methods, we prove that a symplectic singularity admits a finite stratification with smooth symplectic strata. We also prove that in the formal neighborhood of a closed point in some stratum, the singularity is a product of the stratum and a transversal slice. The transversal slice is also a symplectic singularity, and the product decomposition is compatible with natural Poisson structures. Moreover, we prove that the transversal slice admits a C^*-action dilating the symplectic form.
