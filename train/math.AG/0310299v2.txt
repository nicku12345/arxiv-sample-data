We compute some Hodge and Betti numbers of the moduli space of stable rank r degree d vector bundles on a smooth projective curve. We do not assume r and d are coprime. In the process we equip the cohomology of an arbitrary algebraic stack with a functorial mixed Hodge structure. This Hodge structure is computed in the case of the moduli stack of rank r, degree d vector bundles on a curve. Our methods also yield a formula for the Poincare polynomial of the moduli stack that is valid over any ground field.
