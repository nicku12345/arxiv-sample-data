We show that the generating series of some Hodge integrals involving one or two partitions are tau-functions of the KP hierarchy or the 2-Toda hierarchy respectively. We also formulate a conjecture on the connection between relative invariants and integrable hierarchies. The conjecture is verified in some examples.
