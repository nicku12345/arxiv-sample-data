We associate to each automorphism of the plane, a geometric construction with some properties, it is the {\it{canonical resolution}}.   We study the geometry of the canonical resolution, we deduce from it an upper bound for a geometric invariant (the ample index) linked to an automorphism of the affine plane and we link the structure of the effective cone of the surface we get to values of another geometric invariant (the effective index).
