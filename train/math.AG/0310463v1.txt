In this paper we obtain bounds on h^0(E) where E is a semistable bundle of rank 3 over a smooth irreducible projective curve X of genus g \geq 2 defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. These bounds are expressed in terms of the degrees of stability s_1(E), s_2(E). We show also that in some cases the bounds are best possible. These results extend recent work of J. Cilleruelo and I. Sols for bundles of rank 2.
