We construct a polarized Hodge structure on the primitive part of Chen and Ruan's orbifold cohomology H_{orb}^k(X) for projective SL-orbifolds X satisfying a ``Hard Lefschetz Condition''.   Furthermore, the total cohomology H_{orb}^{*,*}(X) forms a mixed Hodge structure that is polarized by every element of the K\"ahler cone of X. Using results of Cattani-Kaplan-Schmid this implies the existence of an abstract polarized variation of Hodge structure on the complexified K\"ahler cone of X. This construction should be considered as the analogue of the abstract polarized variation of Hodge structure that can be attached to the singular cohomology of a crepant resolution of X, in the light of the conjectural correspondence between the (quantum) orbifold cohomology and the (quantum) cohomology of a crepant resolution.
