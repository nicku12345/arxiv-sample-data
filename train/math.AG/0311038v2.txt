We consider smooth codimension two subcanonical subvarieties in \mathbb{P}^n with n \geq 5, lying on a hypersurface of degree s having a linear subspace of multiplicity (s-2). We prove that such varieties are complete intersections. We also give a little improvement to some earlier results on the non existence of rank two vector bundles on \mathbb{P}^4 with small Chern classes.
