We treat equivariant completions of toric contraction morphisms as an application of the toric Mori theory. For this purpose, we generalize the toric Mori theory for non-\mathbb Q-factorial toric varieties. So, our theory seems to be quite different from Reid's original combinatorial toric Mori theory. We also explain various examples of non-\mathbb Q-factorial contractions, which imply that the \mathbb Q-factoriality plays an important role in the Minimal Model Program. Thus, this paper completes the foundations of the toric Mori theory and show us a new aspect of the Minimal Model Program.
