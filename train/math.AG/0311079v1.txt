We determine the structure of the equivariant cohomology and K-theory of Bott towers. By restriction, we obtain similar results for Bott-Samelson varieties. This results allow us to describe more precisely the equivariant cohomology and K-theory of the flag variety X. We give an expression for the cup product in H_T^*(X).
