Let {\cal L} be a local system on the complement X^{\star} of a normal crossing divisor (NCD)  Y in a smooth analytic variety X and let  j: X^{\star} = X - Y \to X  denotes the open embedding. The purpose of this paper is to describe a weight filtration W on the direct image {\bf j}_{\star}{\cal L}  and in case a morphism f: X \to D to a complex disc is given with Y = f^{-1}(0), the weight filtration on the complex of nearby cocycles \Psi_f ({\cal L}) on Y. A comparison theorem shows that the filtration coincides with the weight defined by the logarithm of the monodromy and provides the link with various results on the subject.
