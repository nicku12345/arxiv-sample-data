Effective bounds for the finite number of surjective holomorphic maps between canonically polarized compact complex manifolds of any dimension with fixed domain are proven. Both the case of a fixed target and the case of varying targets are treated. In the case of varying targets, bounds on the complexity of Chow varieties are used.
