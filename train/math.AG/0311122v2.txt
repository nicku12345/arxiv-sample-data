In this paper, we study triples of the form (E, theta, phi) over a compact Riemann Surface, where (E, theta) is a Higgs bundle and phi is a global holomorphic section of the Higgs bundle. Our main result is a description of a birational equivalence which relates geometrically the moduli space of Higgs bundles of rank r and degree d to the moduli space of Higgs bundles of rank (r-1) and degree d.
