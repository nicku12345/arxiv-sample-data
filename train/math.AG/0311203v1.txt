Let r be an orbit of the quiver representation of type A_n (equioriented case). In this paper we study the Poincare dual of the closure of r (a.c.a. Thom polynomial/degeneracy loci formula) in equivariant cohomology. Using general Thom polynomial theory we prove the component formula and its stable version of [Knutson-Miller-Shimozono] as well as the positivity of the quiver coefficients of [Buch-Fulton]. We also show how the component formula follows from Grobner degeneration easily. In relation with the K-theory counterpart of the formula we give a new description of KMS factorizations based on transformations of lace diagrams.
