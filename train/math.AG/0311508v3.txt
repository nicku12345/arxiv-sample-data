We classify the minimal algebraic surfaces of general type with p_g=q=1, K^2=8 and bicanonical map of degree 2. It will turn out that they are isogenous to a product of curves, so that if S is such a surface then there exist two smooth curves C, F and a finite group G acting freely on C \times F such that S = (C \times F)/G. We describe the C, F and G that occur. In particular the curve C is a hyperelliptic-bielliptic curve of genus 3, and the bicanonical map \phi of S is composed with the involution \sigma induced on S by \tau \times id: C \times F \longrightarrow C \times F, where \tau is the hyperelliptic involution of C. In this way we obtain three families of surfaces with p_g=q=1, K^2=8 which yield the first known examples of surfaces with these invariants. We compute their dimension, and we show that they are three smooth and irreducible components of the moduli space \mathcal{M} of surfaces with p_g=q=1, K^2=8. For each of these families, an alternative description as a double cover of the plane is also given, and the index of the paracanonical system is computed.
