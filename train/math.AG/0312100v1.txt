Using a simple geometric argument, we obtain an infinite family of nontrivial relations in the tautological ring of M_g (and in fact that of M_{g,2}). One immediate consequence of these relations is that the classes \kappa_1,...,\kappa_{[g/3]} generate the tautological ring of M_g, which has been conjectured by Faber, and recently proven at the level of {\em cohomology} by Morita.
