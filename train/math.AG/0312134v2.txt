The projective coordinate ring of a projective Poisson scheme X does not usually admit a structure of a Poisson algebra. We show that when H^1(X,O_X)=H^2(X,O_X)=0, this can be corrected by embedding X into a canonical one-parameter deformation. The scheme X then becomes the Hamiltonian reduction of the spectrum of the deformed projective coordinate ring with respect to G_m. The projection into the base of the deformation is the moment map.
