We consider algebraic manifolds Y of dimension 3 over \Bbb{C} with H^i(Y, \Omega^j_Y)=0 for all j\geq 0 and i>0. Let X be a smooth completion of Y with D=X-Y, an effective divisor on X with normal crossings. If the D-dimension of X is not zero, then Y is a fibre space over a smooth affine curve C (i.e., we have a surjective morphism from Y to C such that general fibre is smooth and irreducible) such that every fibre satisfies the same vanishing condition. If an irreducible smooth fibre is not affine, then the Kodaira dimension of X is -\infty and the D-dimension of X is 1. We also discuss sufficient conditions from the behavior of fibres or higher direct images to guarantee the global vanishing of Hodge cohomology and the affineness of Y.
