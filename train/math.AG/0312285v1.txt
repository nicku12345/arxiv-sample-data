Let C be a curve of genus 2 and \psi_1:C \lar E_1 a map of degree n, from C to an elliptic curve E_1, both curves defined over \bC. This map induces a degree n map \phi_1:\bP^1 \lar \bP^1 which we call a Frey-Kani covering. We determine all possible ramifications for \phi_1. If \psi_1:C \lar E_1 is maximal then there exists a maximal map \psi_2:C\lar E_2, of degree n, to some elliptic curve E_2 such that there is an isogeny of degree n^2 from the Jacobian J_C to E_1 \times E_2. We say that J_C is (n,n)-decomposable. If the degree n is odd the pair (\psi_2, E_2) is canonically determined. For n=3, 5, and 7, we give arithmetic examples of curves whose Jacobians are (n,n)-decomposable.
