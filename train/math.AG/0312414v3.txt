For every odd prime number p, we give examples of non-constant smooth families of genus 2 curves over fields of characteristic p which have pro-Galois (pro-\'etale) covers of infinite degree with geometrically connected fibers. The Jacobians of the curves are isomorphic to products of elliptic curves.
