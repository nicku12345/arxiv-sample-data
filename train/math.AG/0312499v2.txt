Let X and Y be smooth projective varieties over \C. We say that X and Y are \emph{D-equivalent} (or, X is a \emph{Fourier--Mukai partner} of Y) if their derived categories of bounded complexes of coherent sheaves are equivalent as triangulated categories. The aim of this short note is to find an example of mutually D-equivalent but not isomorphic relatively minimal elliptic surfaces.
