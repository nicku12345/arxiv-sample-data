For a smooth projective variety X\subset \P^r embedded by the complete linear system, Property N_p has been studied for a long time. On the other hand, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity conjecture and related problems have been focused for a projective variety which is not necessarily linearly normal. This paper aims to explain the influence of Property N_p on higher normality and defining equations of a smooth variety embedded by sub-linear system. Also we prove a claim about Property N_p of surface scrolls which is a generalization of Green's work in \cite{Green} about Property N_p for curves.
