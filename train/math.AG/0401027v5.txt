For a vector bundle \mathcal{E} of rank n+1 over a smooth projective curve C of genus g, let X=\P_C (\mathcal{E}) with projection map \pi:X\to C. In this paper we investigate the minimal free resolution of homogeneous coordinate rings of X.   We first clarify the relations between higher syzygies of very ample line bundles on X and higher syzygies of Veronese embedding of fibres of \pi by the same line bundle. More precisely, letting H = \mathcal{O}_{\P_C (\mathcal{E})} (1) be the tautological line bundle, we prove that if (\P^n,\mathcal{O}_{\P^n} (a)) satisfies Property N_p, then (X,aH+\pi^*B) satisfies Property N_p for all B \in {Pic}C having sufficiently large degree(Theorem \ref{thm:positive}). And also the effective bound of {deg}(B) for Property N_p is obtained(Theorem \ref{thm:1}, \ref{thm:2}, \ref{thm:3} and \ref{thm:4}). For the converse, we get some partial answer(Corollary \ref{cor:negative}). Secondly, by using these results we prove some Mukai-type statements. In particular, Mukai's conjecture is true for X when {rank}(\mathcal{E}) \geq g and \mu^- (\mathcal{E}) is an integer(Corollary \ref{cor:Mukai}). Finally for all n, we construct an n-dimensional ruled variety X and an ample line bundle A \in {Pic}X which shows that the condition of Mukai's conjecture is optimal for every p \geq 0.
