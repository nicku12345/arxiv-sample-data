Let Y be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension N+1, L an invertible sufficiently ample sheaf, X\in |L| a smooth hypersurface and \lambda\in F^kH^N(X,C) a vanishing cohomology class, where F^{*} is the Hodge filtration and k\in\{1,...,[N/2]\}. Assume that L is sufficiently ample and that the codimension in |L| of the Hodge variety associated to \lambda (locally defined as the locus where the image of \lambda by flat transport over |L| remains in F^k) is sufficiently small.   I show that this forces N to be even and k=[N/2], and that the class \lambda is a linear combination with complex coefficients of classes of algebraic subvarieties of X of small degree. As a corollary, I obtain that the components of smallest codimensions of the Noether-Lefschetz locus are spanned by classes of algebraic subvarieties as predicted by Hodge conjecture.   The proof relies on an algebraic description of the infinitesimal neighboorghood of the Noether-Lefschetz locus at any order and on a (global) monodromy result.
