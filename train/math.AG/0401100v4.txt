We study higher syzygies of a ruled surface X over a curve of genus g with the numerical invariant e. Let L \in {Pic}X be a line bundle in the numerical class of aC_0 +bf. We prove that for 0 \leq e \leq g-3, L satisfies property N_p if a \geq p+2 and b-ae \geq 3g-1-e+p and for e \geq g-2, L satisfies property N_p if a \geq p+2 and b-ae\geq 2g+1+p. By using these facts, we obtain Mukai type results. For ample line bundles A_i, we show that K_X + A_1 + ... + A_q satisfies property N_p when 0 \leq e < \frac{g-3}{2} and q \geq g-2e+1 +p or when e \geq \frac{g-3}{2} and q \geq p+4. Therefore we prove Mukai's conjecture for ruled surface with e \geq \frac{g-3}{2}. Also we prove that when X is an elliptic ruled surface with e \geq 0, L satisfies property N_p if and only if a \geq 1 and b-ae\geq 3+p.
