Teichmueller curves are geodesic discs in Teichmueller space that project to an algebraic curve in the moduli space M_g. We show that for all g \geq 2 Teichmueller curves map to the locus of real multiplication in the moduli space of abelian varieties. Remark that McMullen has shown that precisely for g=2 the locus of real multiplication is stable under the \SL_2(\RR)-action on the tautological bundle \Omega\M_g.   We also show that Teichmueller curves are defined over number fields and we provide a completely algebraic description of Teichmueller curves in terms of Higgs bundles. As a consequence we show that the absolute Galois group acts on the set of Teichmueller curves.
