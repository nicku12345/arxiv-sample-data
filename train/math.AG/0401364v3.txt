This is a sequel to the paper "Frobenius amplitude and strong vanishing theorems for vector bundles" (math.AG/0202129). We introduce a more elementary variant of the notion of F-amplitude from the earlier paper which we call amplitude. This provides another measure of positivity of a vector bundle which is related to a number of preexisting positivity notions such as k-ampleness or q-convexity. We use this to refine the estimates of F-amplitude from the first paper, and to deduce some further vanishing theorems as a consequence. We also give some new proofs of some known vanishing theorems for Abelian and toric varieties by analogous methods. For technical reasons, we need to develop a theory of partial Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity which provides a rough measure of the cohomological complexity of a sheaf. Since this material may have independent interest, it is contained in a section which can be read on its own.
