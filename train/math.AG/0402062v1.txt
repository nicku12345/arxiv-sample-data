We introduce deformation theoretic methods for determining when a curve X in a non-hyperelliptic jacobian JC will deform with JC to a non-jacobian. We apply these methods to a particular class of curves in symmetric powers C^{(e)} of C where 3\leq e\leq g-3. More precisely, given a pencil g^1_d of degree d on C, let X be the curve parametrizing divisors of degree e in divisors of g^1_d (see the paper for the precise scheme-theoretical definition). Under certain genericity assumptions on the pair (C, g^1_d), we prove that if X deforms infinitesimally out of the jacobian locus with JC then either d=2e, dimH^0 (g^1_d) = e or d=2e+1, dimH^0 (g^1_d) = e+1. The analogous result in the case e=2 without genericity assumptions was proved earlier.
