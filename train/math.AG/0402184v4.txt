Let X be a smooth projective curve over a finite field F_q. Let \rho be a continuous representation \pi(X)\to GL_n(F), where F=F_l((t)) with F_l being another finite field of order prime to q.   Assume that \rho|_{\pi(\bar{X})} is irreducible. De Jong's conjecture says that in this case \rho(\pi(\bar{X})) is finite. As was shown in the original paper of de Jong, this conjecture follows from an existence of an F-valued automorphic form corresponding to \rho is the sense of Langlands. The latter follows, in turn, from a version of the Geometric Langlands conjecture.   In this paper we sketch a proof of the required version of the geometric conjecture, assuming that char(F)\neq 2, thereby proving de Jong's conjecture in this case.
