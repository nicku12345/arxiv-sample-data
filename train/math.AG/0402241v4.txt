We classify these threefolds, which are the ones such that their universal cover is not compact and not covered by positive-dimensional compact analytic subsets. We show that these threefolds have nonnegative Kodaira dimension, and that their Iitaka-Moishezon fibrations are, after a suitable finite etale cover, bimeromorphic to a submersion with fibres complex tori, and base of general type and \pi_1-general type.
