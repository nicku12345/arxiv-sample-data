The purpose of this paper is to provide a new account of multiplicity for finite morphisms between smooth projective varieties. Traditionally, this has been defined using commutative algebra in terms of the length of integral ring extensions. In model theory, a different approch to multiplicity was developed by Zilber using the techniques of non-standard analysis. Here, we first reformulate Zilber's method in the language of algebraic geometry and secondly show that, in classical projective situations, the two notions essentially coincide. As a consequence, we can recover intersection theory in all characteristics from the non-standard method and sketch further developments in connection with etale cohomology and deformation theory. The usefulness of this approach can be seen from the increasing interplay between Zariski structures and objects of non-commutative geometry.
