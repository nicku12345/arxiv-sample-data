A notion of the radial index of an isolated singular point of a 1-form on a singular (real or complex) variety is discussed. For the differential of a function it is related to the Euler characteristic of the Milnor fibre of the function. A connection between the radial index and the local Euler obstruction of a 1-form is described. This gives an expression for the local Euler obstruction of the differential of a function in terms of Euler characteristics of some Milnor fibres.
