Let Y be a smooth projective curve of genus g\ge 2 and let M_{r,d}(Y) be the moduli space of stable vector bundles of rank r and degree d on Y. A classical conjecture of Newstead and Ramanan states that  c_i(M_{2,1}(Y))=0 for i>2(g-1) i.e. the top 2g-1 Chern classes vanish.   The purpose of this paper is to generalize this vanishing result to the rank 3 case by generalizing Gieseker's degeneration method. More precisely, we prove that c_i(M_{3,1}(Y))=0 for i>6g-5. In other words, the top 3g-3 Chern classes vanish. Notice that we also have c_i(M_{3,2}(Y))=0 for i>6g-5.
