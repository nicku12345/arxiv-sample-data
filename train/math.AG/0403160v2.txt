We generalize the motivic incarnation morphism from the theory of arithmetic integration to the relative case, where we work over a base variety S over a field k of characteristic zero. We develop a theory of constructible effective Chow motives over S, and we show how to associate a motive to any S-variety.   We give a geometric proof of relative quantifier elimination for pseudo-finite fields, and we construct a morphism from the Grothendieck ring of the theory of pseudo-finite fields over S, to the tensor product of Q with the Grothendieck ring of constructible effective Chow motives. This morphism yields a motivic realization for the parametrized arithmetic motivic integrals of Cluckers-Loeser.   Finally, we define relative arc and jet spaces, and the three relative motivic generating series.
