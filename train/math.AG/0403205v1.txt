Fix integers a\geq 1, b and c. We prove that for certain projective varieties V\subset{\bold P}^r (e.g. certain possibly singular complete intersections), there are only finitely many components of the Hilbert scheme parametrizing irreducible, smooth, projective, low codimensional subvarieties X of V such that  h^0(X,\Cal O_X(aK_X-bH_X)) \leq \lambda d^{\epsilon_1}+c(\sum_{1\leq h < \epsilon_2}p_g(X^{(h)})),  where d, K_X and H_X denote the degree, the canonical divisor and the general hyperplane section of X, p_g(X^{(h)}) denotes the geometric genus of the general linear section of X of dimension h, and where \lambda, \epsilon_1 and \epsilon_2 are suitable positive real numbers depending only on the dimension of X, on a and on the ambient variety V. In particular, except for finitely many families of varieties, the canonical map of any irreducible, smooth, projective, low codimensional subvariety X of V, is birational.
