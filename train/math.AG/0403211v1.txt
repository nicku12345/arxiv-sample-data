We continue to study birational geometry of Fano fibrations \pi\colon V\to {\mathbb P}^1 the fibers of which are Fano double hypersurfaces of index 1. For a majority of families of this type, which do not satisfy the condition of sufficient twistedness over the base, we prove birational rigidity (in particular, it means that there are no other structures of a fibration into rationally connected varieties) and compute their groups of birational self-maps. We considerably improve the principal components of the method of maximal singularities, in the first place, the technique of counting multiplicities for the fibrations V/{\mathbb P}^1 into Fano varieties over the line.
