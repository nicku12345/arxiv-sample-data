In the present paper the small Quantum Cohomology ring of some Fano threefolds which are obtained as one- or two-curve blow-ups from P^3 or the quadric Q^3 is explicitely computed. Because of systematic usage of the associativity property of quantum product only a very small and enumerative subset of Gromov-Witten invariants is needed. Then, for these threefolds the Dubrovin conjecture on the semisimplicity of Quantum Cohomology is proven by checking the computed Quantum Cohomology rings and by showing that a smooth Fano threefold X with b_3(X)=0 admits a complete exceptional set of the appropriate length.
