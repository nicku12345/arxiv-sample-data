For a smooth projective variety X, let CH(X) be the Chow ring (with rational coefficients) of algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence. The conjectures of Bloch and Beilinson predict the existence of a functorial ring filtration of CH(X). We want to investigate for which varieties this filtration splits, that is, comes from a graduation on CH(X) -- this occurs for K3 surfaces and, conjecturally, for abelian varieties.   We observe that, though the Bloch-Beilinson filtration is only conjectural, the fact that it splits has some simple consequences which can be tested in concrete examples. Namely, for a regular variety X, it implies that the sub-Q-algebra of CH(X) spanned by divisor classes injects into the cohomology of X . We give examples of Calabi-Yau threefolds which do not satisfy this property. On the other hand we conjecture that the property does indeed hold for (holomorphic) symplectic manifolds, and we give some (weak) evidence in favour of this conjecture.
