Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring with residue characteristic p>0. In this note we give an example of a Galois cover f:Y\to X between flat and normal formal R-schemes of finite type which is \'etale above the generic fibre of X such that the special fibre of Y is reduced and such that f doesn't have the structure of a torsor under a finite and flat R group scheme. In the example R has equal characteristic p and the Galois group of the cover is cyclic of order p^2. In the example the formal scheme X is affine and can be choosen to be even smooth.
