A resolution Z \to X of a Poisson variety X is called {\em Poisson} if every Poisson structure on X lifts to a Poisson structure on Z. For symplectic varieties, we prove that Poisson resolutions coincide with symplectic resolutions. It is shown that for a Poisson surface S, the natural resolution S^{[n]} \to S^{(n)} is a Poisson resolution. Furthermore, if Bs|-K_S| = \emptyset, we prove that this is the unique projective Poisson resolution for S^{(n)}.
