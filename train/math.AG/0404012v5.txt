We study moduli spaces of vector bundles on a two-dimensional neighbourhood Z_k of an irreducible curve \ell = CP^1 with \ell^2 = -k and give an explicit construction of these moduli as stratified spaces. We give sharp bounds for the local holomorphic Euler characteristic of bundles on Z_k and prove existence of families of bundles with prescribed numerical invariants.   Our numerical calculations are performed using a Macaulay 2 algorithm, which is available for download at http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~s0571100/Instanton/ .
