Surfaces of general type with geometric genus p_g=0, which can be given as Galois covering of the projective plane branched over an arrangement of lines with Galois group G=(\mathbb Z/q\mathbb Z)^k, where k\geq 2 and q is a prime number, are investigated. The classical Godeaux surface, Campedelli surfaces, Burniat surfaces, and a new surface X with K_X^2=6 and (\mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z)^3\subset {Tors} (X) can be obtained as such coverings. It is proved that the group of automorphisms of a generic surface of the Campedelli type is isomorphic to (\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^3. The irreducible components of the moduli space containing the Burniat surfaces are described. It is shown that the Burniat surface S with K_S^2=2 has the torsion group {Tors} (S)\simeq (\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^3, (therefore, it belongs to the family of the Campedelli surfaces), i.e., the corresponding statement in the papers of C. Peters "On certain examples of surfaces with p_g=0" in Nagoya Math. J. {\bf 66} (1977), and I. Dolgachev "Algebraic surfaces with q=p_g=0" in {\it Algebraic surfaces}, Liguori, Napoli (1977), and in the book of W. Barth, C. Peters, A. Van de Ven "Compact complex surfaces", p. 237, about the torsion group of the Burniat surface S with K_S^2=2 is not correct.
