In this paper we prove the Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture for quasi-homogeneous linear systems of multiplicity 6 on P^2. For the proof we use the degeneration of the plane by Ciliberto and Miranda and results by Laface, Seibert, Ugaglia and Yang. As an application we derive a classification of the special systems of multiplicity 6.
