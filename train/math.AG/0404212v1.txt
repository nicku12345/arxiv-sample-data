We introduce the etale framework to study Igusa zeta functions in several variables, generalizing the machinery of vanishing cycles in the univariate case. We define the etale Alexander modules, associated to a morphism of varieties F from X to affine r-space, a geometric point of X, and an object in the derived category of constructible l-adic sheaves on the inverse image of the r-torus under F. The Alexander modules are sheaves of modules on the scheme of continuous characters of the tame fundamental group of the r-torus. We formulate Loeser's Monodromy and Holomorphy Conjectures for multivariate p-adic zeta functions, and prove them in the case where dim(X)=2, generalizing results from the univariate case. Furthermore, we prove a comparison theorem with the transcendent case, we study a formula of Denef's for the zeta function in terms of a simultaneous embedded resolution, and we generalize a result concerning the degree of the zeta function to our setting.
