We say that a complex analytic space, X, is an intersection cohomology manifold if and only if the shifted constant sheaf on X is isomorphic to intersection cohomology; this is quickly seen to be equivalent to X being a homology manifold. Given an analytic function f on an intersection cohomology manifold, we describe a simple relation between V(f) being an intersection cohomology manifold and the vanishing cycle Milnor monodromy of f. We then describe how the Sebastiani-Thom isomorphism allows us to easily produce intersection cohomology manifolds with arbitrary singular sets. Finally, as an easy application, we obtain restrictions on the cohomology of the Milnor fiber of a hypersurface with a special type of one-dimensional critical locus.
