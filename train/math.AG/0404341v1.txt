We study the homotopy groups of complements to reducible divisors on non-singular projective varieties with ample components and isolated non normal crossings. We prove a vanishing theorem generalizing conditions for commutativity of the fundamental groups. The calculation of supports of non vanishing homotopy groups as modules over the fundamental group in terms of the geometry of the locus of non-normal crossings is discussed. We review previous work on the local study of isolated non-normal crossings and relate the motivic zeta function to the local polytopes of quasiadjunction. As an application, we obtain information about the support loci of homotopy groups of arrangements of hyperplanes
