Let X be a projective K3 surface with generic polarization \cO_X(1) and let M_c=M(2,0,c) be the moduli space of semistable torsion-free sheaves on X of rank 2, with Chern classes c_1=0 and c_2=c. When c=2n\ge 4 is even, M_c is a singular projective variety. We show that there is no symplectic desingularization of M_{2n} if \frac{n a_n}{2n-3} is not an integer where a_n is the Euler number of the Hilbert scheme X^{[n]} of n points in X.
