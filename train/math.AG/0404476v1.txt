In this paper, we give explicit combinatorial descriptions for toric extremal contractions under the relative setting, where varieties do not need to be complete. Fujino's completion theorem is the key to the main result. As applications, we can generalize some of Mustata's results related to Fujita's conjecture on toric varieties for the relative case.
