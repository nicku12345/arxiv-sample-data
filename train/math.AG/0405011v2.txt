We prove birational superrigidity of direct products V=F_1\times...\times F_K of primitive Fano varieties of the following two types: either F_i\subset{\mathbb P}^M is a general hypersurface of degree M, M\geq 6, or F_i\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}{\mathbb P}^M is a general double space of index 1, M\geq 3. In particular, each structure of a rationally connected fiber space on V is given by a projection onto a direct factor. The proof is based on the connectedness principle of Shokurov and Koll\' ar and the technique of hypertangent divisors.
