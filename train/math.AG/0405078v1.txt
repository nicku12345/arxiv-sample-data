We will use flat divisors, and canonically associated singular holomorphic foliations, to investigate some of the geometry of compact complex manifolds. The paper is mainly concerned with three distinct problems: the existence of fibrations, the topology of smooth hypersurfaces and the topological closure of transcendental leaves of foliations.
