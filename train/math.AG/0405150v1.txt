The \mathbb{Q}-factoriality of a nodal quartic 3-fold implies its non-rationality. We prove that a nodal quartic 3-fold with at most 8 nodes is \mathbb{Q}-factorial, and we show that a nodal quartic 3-fold with 9 nodes is not \mathbb{Q}-factorial if and only if it contains a plane. However, there are non-rational non-\mathbb{Q}-factorial nodal quartic 3-folds in \mathbb{P}^4. In particular, we prove the non-rationality of a general non-\mathbb{Q}-factorial nodal quartic 3-fold that contains either a plane or a smooth del Pezzo surface of degree 4.
