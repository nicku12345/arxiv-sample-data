In this paper we study some new theories of characteristic homology classes for singular complex algebraic varieties. First we introduce a natural transformation T_{y}: K_{0}(var/X) -> H_{*}(X,Q)[y] commuting with proper pushdown, which generalizes the corresponding Hirzebruch characteristic. Here K_{0}(var/X) is the relative Grothendieck group of complex algebraic varieties over X as introduced and studied by Looijenga and Bittner in relation to motivic integration. T_{y} is a homology class version of the motivic measure corresponding to a suitable specialization of the well known Hodge polynomial. This transformation unifies the Chern class transformation of MacPherson and Schwartz (for y=-1) and the Todd class transformation in the singular Riemann-Roch theorem of Baum-Fulton-MacPherson (for y=0). In fact, T_{y} is the composition of a generalized version of this Todd class transformation due to Yokura, and a new motivic Chern class transformation mC_{*}: K_{0}(var/X)-> G_{0}(X)[y], which generalizes the total lambda-class of the cotangent bundle to singular spaces. Here G_{0}(X) is the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, and the construction of mC_{*} is based on some results from the theory of algebraic mixed Hodge modules due to M.Saito. In the final part of the paper we use the algebraic cobordism theory of Levine and Morel to lift mC_{*} further up to a natural transformation mC'_{*} from K_{0}(var/X) to a suitable universal Borel-Moore weak homology theory. Moreover, all our results can be extended to varieties over a base field k, which can be embedded into the complex numbers.
