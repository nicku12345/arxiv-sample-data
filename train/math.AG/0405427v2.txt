For a partition lambda=\{lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3 \} of non-negative integers, we calculate the Euler characteristic of the local system V_{\lambda} on the moduli space of genus 3 hyperelliptic curves using a suitable stratification. For some \lambda of low degree, we make a guess for the motivic Euler characteristic of V_{\lambda} using counting of curves over finite fields.
