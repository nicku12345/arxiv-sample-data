The distribution of the spectral numbers of an isolated hypersurface singularity is studied in terms of the Bernoulli moments. These are certain rational linear combinations of the higher moments of the spectral numbers. They are related to the generalized Bernoulli polynomials. We conjecture that their signs are alternating and prove this in many cases. One motivation for the Bernoulli moments comes from the comparison with compact complex manifolds.
