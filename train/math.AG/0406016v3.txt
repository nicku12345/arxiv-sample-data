Let M be a smooth and compact moduli space of stable coherent sheaves on a projective surface S with an effective (or trivial) anti-canonical line bundle. We find generators for the cohomology ring of M, with integral coefficients. When S is simply connected and a universal sheaf E exists over SxM, then its class [E] admits a Kunneth decomposition as a class in the tensor product of the topological K-rings K(S) and K(M). The generators are the Chern classes of the Kunneth factors of [E] in K(M). The general case is similar
