We prove that a normal affine surface V over \bf C admits an effective action of a maximal torus {\bf T}={\bf C}^{*n} (n\le 2) such that any other effective {\bf C}^*-action is conjugate to a subtorus of \bf T in Aut (V), in the following particular cases: (a) the Makar-Limanov invariant ML(V) is nontrivial, (b) V is a toric surface, (c) V={\bf P}^1\times {\bf P}^1\backslash \Delta, where \Delta is the diagonal, and (d) V={\bf P}^2\backslash Q, where Q is a nonsingular quadric. In case (a) this generalizes a result of Bertin for smooth surfaces, whereas (b) was previously known for the case of the affine plane (Gutwirth) and (d) is a result of Danilov-Gizatullin and Doebeli.
