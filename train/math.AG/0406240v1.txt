The Poincare series of a multi-index filtration on the ring of germs of functions can be written as a certain integral with respect to the Euler characteristic over the projectivization of the ring. Here this integral is considered with respect to the generalized Euler characteristic with values in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. For the filtration defined by orders of functions on the components of a plane curve singularity C and for the so called divisorial filtration for a modification of (\C^2,0) by a sequence of blowing-ups there are given formulae for this integral in terms of an embedded resolution of the germ C or in terms of the modification respectively. The generalized Euler characteristic of the extended semigroup corresponding to the divisorial filtration is computed.
