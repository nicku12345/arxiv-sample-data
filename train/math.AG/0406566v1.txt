Let R be a commutative noetherian ring and f_{1}, ..., f_{r} \in R. In this article we give (cf. the Theorem in \S2) a criterion for f_{1}, ..., f_{r} to be regular sequence for a finitely generated module over R which strengthens and generalises a result in \cite{2}. As an immediate consequence we deduce that if {\rm V}(g_{1}, ..., g_{r}) \subseteq {\rm V} (f_{1}, >..., f_{r}) in Spec R and if f_{1}, ..., f_{r} is a regular sequence in R, then g_{1}, ..., g_{r} is also a regular sequence in R.
