Let M_c=M(2,0,c) be the moduli space of O(1)-semistable rank 2 torsion-free sheaves with Chern classes c_1=0 and c_2=c on a K3 surface X where O(1) is a generic ample line bundle on X. When c=2n\geq4 is even, M_c is a singular projective variety equipped with a symplectic structure on the smooth locus. In this paper, we show that there is no crepant resolution of M_{2n} for n\geq 3. This implies that there is no symplectic desingularization.
