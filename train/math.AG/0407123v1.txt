Let X be a minuscule Schubert variety and \alpha a class of 1-cycle on X. In this article we describe the irreducible components of the scheme of morphisms of class \alpha from a rational curve to X.   The irreducible components are described in the following way : the class \alpha can be seen as an element of Pic(X)^* the dual of the Picard group. Because any Weil-divisor need not to be a Cartier-divisor, there is (only) a surjective map s:A^1(X)^*\to Pic(X)^* from the dual of the group of codimension 1 cycles to the dual of the Picard group. The irreducible components are given by the effective elements \beta in A^1(X)^* such that s(\beta)=\alpha.   The proof of the result uses the Bott-Samelson resolution Y of X. We prove that any curve on X can be lifted in Y (after deformation). This is because any divisor on minuscule Schubert variety is a moving one. Then we prove that any curve coming from X can be deformed so that it does not meet the contracted divisor of Y\to X. This is possible because for minuscule Schubert variety there are lines in the projectivised tangent space to a singularity. It is now sufficient to deal with the case of the orbit of Stab(X) the stabiliser of X and we can apply results of our previous paper math.AG/0003199.
