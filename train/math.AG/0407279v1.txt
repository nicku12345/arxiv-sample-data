We investigate the geometry of Legendrian complex projective manifolds X\subset\PP V. By definition, this means V is a complex vector space of dimension 2n+2, endowed with a symplectic form, and the affine tangent space to X at each point is a maximal isotropic subspace. We establish basic facts about their geometry and exhibit examples of inhomogeneous smooth Legendrian varieties, the first examples of such in dimension greater than one.
