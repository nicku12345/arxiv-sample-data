Let X be an irreducible projective variety of dimension n in a projective space and let x be a point of X. Denote by {\rm Curves}_d(X,x) the space of curves of degree d lying on X and passing through x. We will show that the number of components of {\rm Curves}_d(X,x) for any smooth point x outside a subvariety of codimension \geq 2 is bounded by a number depending only on n and d. An effective bound is given. A key ingredient of the proof is an argument from Ein-K\"uchle-Lazarsfeld's work on Seshadri numbers.
