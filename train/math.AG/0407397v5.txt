Let V be a smooth projective 3-fold of general type. Denote by K^3, a rational number, the self-intersection of the canonical sheaf of any minimal model of V. One defines K^3 as the canonical volume of V. Assume p_g\ge 2. We show that K^3\ge {1/3}, which is a sharp lower bound. Then we classify those V with small K^3 up to explicit tructure. We also give some new examples with p_g=2 which have maximal canonical stability index. Finally we give an application to certain algebraic 4-folds.
