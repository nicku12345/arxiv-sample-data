In this article, we analyze the connection between the Log De Rham Cohomology of an fs (not necessary log smooth) log scheme Y over \mathbb C (for Y admitting an exact closed immersion into an fs log smooth log scheme over \mathbb C), its Log Infinitesimal Cohomology H^{^.}(Y^{log}_{inf}, \mathcal O_{Y^{log}_{inf}}), and its Log Betti Cohomology, which is the Cohomology of its associated Kato-Nakayama topological space Y^{an}_{log}, and we prove that they are isomorphic. These results are the log scheme analogues of two classical comparison theorems.
