In this paper we shall study symplectic resolutions of a nilpotent orbit closure of a complex simple Lie algebra \g. We shall introduce an equivalence relation in the set of parabolic subgroups of G in terms of marked Dynkin diagrams. We start with a nilpotent orbit closure which admits a Springer resolution with a parabolic subgroup P_0 of G. Then we prove that all symplectic resolution of the nilpotent closure are Springer resolutions with P which are equivalent to P_0. Here all symplectic resolutions are connected by Mukai flops. We need three types of Mukai flops (types A, D and E_6) in connecting symplectic resolutions. In particular, Mukai flops of type E_6 are new.   All arguments of Part I : math.AG/0404072 which use flags, are replaced by those which use only Dynkin diagrams.
