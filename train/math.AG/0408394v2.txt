We investigate conditions for "simultaneous normalizability" of a family of reduced schemes, i.e., the normalization of the total space normalizes, fiber by fiber, each member of the family. The main result (under more general conditions) is that a flat family of reduced equidimensional projective complex varieties X_y with parameter y ranging over a normal space--algebraic or analytic--admits a simultaneous normalization if and only if the Hilbert polynomial of the integral closure of the structure sheaf O_{X_y} is locally independent of y. When the X_y are curves projectivity is not needed, and the statement reduces to the well known \delta-constant criterion of Teissier. Proofs are basically algebraic, analytic results being related via standard techniques (Stein compacta, etc.) to more abstract algebraic ones.
