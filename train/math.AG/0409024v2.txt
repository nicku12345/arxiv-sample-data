With every nontrivial connected algebraic group G we associate a positive integer {\rm gtd}(G) called the generic transitivity degree of G and equal to the maximal n such that there is a nontrivial action of G on an irreducible algebraic variety X for which the diagonal action of G on X^n admits an open orbit. We show that {\rm gtd}(G)\leqslant 2 (respectively, {\rm gtd}(G)=\nobreak 1) for all solvable (respectively, nilpotent) G, and we calculate {\rm gtd}(G) for all reductive G. We prove that if G is nonabelian reductive, then the above maximal n is attained for X=G/P where P is a proper maximal parabolic subgroup of G (but not only for such homogeneous spaces of G). For every reductive G and its proper maximal parabolic subgroup P, we find the maximal r such that the diagonal action of G (respectively, a Levi subgroup L of ~P) on (G/P)^r admits an open G-orbit (respectively, L-orbit). As an application, we obtain upper bounds for the multiplicities of trivial components in some tensor product decompositions. As another application, we classify all the pairs (G, P) such that the action of G on (G/P)^3 admits an open orbit, answering a question of {\sc M. Burger}.
