Let X be a four-dimensional projective variety defined over the field of complex numbers with only terminal singularities. We prove that if the intersection number of the canonical divisor K with every very general curve is positive (K is almost numerically positive) then every very general proper subvariety of X is of general type in the viewpoint of geometric Kodaira dimension. We note that the converse does not hold for simple abelian varieties.
