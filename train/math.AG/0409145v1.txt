We examine logarithmic connections with vanishing p-curvature on smooth curves by studying their kernels, describing them in terms of formal local decomposition. We then apply our results in the case of connections of rank 2 on P^1, classifying such connections in terms of self-maps of P^1 with prescribed ramification.
