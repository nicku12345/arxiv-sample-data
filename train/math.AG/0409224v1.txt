We prove the conjecture that two projective symplectic resolutions for a symplectic variety W are related by Mukai's elementary transformations over W in codimension 2 in the following cases: (i). nilpotent orbit closures in a classical simple complex Lie algebra; (ii). some quotient symplectic varieties.
