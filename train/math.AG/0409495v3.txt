For a pair of affine toric varieties X and Y defined by dual cones, we define an equivalence between two triangulated categories. The first is a mixed version of the equivariant derived category of X and the second is a mixed version of the derived category of sheaves on Y which are locally constant with unipotent monodromy on each orbit. This equivalence satisfies the Koszul duality formalism of Beilinson, Ginzburg, and Soergel. A similar duality was constructed in math.AG/0308216; this new approach is more canonical.
