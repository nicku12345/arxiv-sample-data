We study completely the Hilbert scheme and punctual Hilbert scheme of a nodal curve, and the relative Hilbert scheme of a family of curves acquiring a node. The results are then extended, less completely, to flag Hilbert schemes, parametrizing chains of subschemes. We find, notably, that if the total space X of a family X/B is smooth (over an algebraically closed field \k), then the relative Hilbert scheme Hilb_m(X/B) is smooth over \k and the flag Hilbert schemes are normal and locally complete intersection, but generally singular.
