Let \Cal U be an open neighborhood of the origin in \Bbb C^{n+1} and let f:(\Cal U, \bold 0)\to(\Bbb C, 0) be complex analytic. Let z_0 be a generic linear form on \Bbb C^{n+1}. If the relative polar curve \Gamma^1_{f, z_0} at the origin is irreducible and the intersection number \big(\Gamma^1_{f, z_0}\cdot V(f))_\bold 0 is prime, then there are severe restrictions on the possible degree n cohomology of the Milnor fiber at the origin. We also obtain some interesting, weaker, results when \big(\Gamma^1_{f, z_0}\cdot V(f))_\bold 0 is not prime.
