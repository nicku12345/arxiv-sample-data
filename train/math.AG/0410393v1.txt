For any projective curve X let \bar{M}^d(X) be the Simpson moduli space of pure dimension one rank 1 degree d sheaves that are semistable with respect to a fixed polarization H on X. When X is a reduced curve the connected component of \bar{M}^d(X) that contains semistable line bundles can be considered as the compactified Jacobian of X. In this paper we give explicitly the structure of this compactified Simpson Jacobian for the following projective curves: tree-like curves and all reduced and reducible curves that can appear as Kodaira singular fibers of an elliptic fibration, that is, the fibers of types III, IV and I_N with N\geq 2
