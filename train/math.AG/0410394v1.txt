We prove that if X and S are smooth varieties and f\colon X\to S is an elliptic fibration with singular fibers curves of types I_N with N\geq 1, II, III and IV, then the relative Jacobian \hat{f}\colon \bar{M}_{X/S}\to S of f, defined as the relative moduli space of semistable pure dimension one sheaves of rank 1 and degree 0 on the fibers of f, is an elliptic fibration such that all its fibers are irreducible. This extends known results when fibers are integral or of type I_2.
