The cohomology of the Hilbert schemes of points on smooth projective surfaces can be approached both with vertex algebra tools and equivariant tools. Using the first tool, we study the existence and the structure of universal formulas for the Chern classes of the tangent bundle over the Hilbert scheme of points on a projective surface. The second tool leads then to nice generating formulas in the particular case of the Hilbert scheme of points on the affine plane.
