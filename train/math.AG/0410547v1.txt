Let (X,o) be a germ of a 3-dimensional terminal singularity of index m\geq 2. If (X,o) has type cAx/4, cD/3-3, cD/2-2, or cE/2, then assume that the standard equation of X in \mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_m is non-degenerate with respect to its Newton diagram. Let \pi\colon Y\to X be a resolution. We show that there are not more than 2 non-rational divisors E_i, i=1,2, on Y such that \pi(E_i)=o and discrepancy a(E_i,X)\leq 1. When such divisors exist, we describe them as exceptional divisors of certain blowups of X and study their birational type.
