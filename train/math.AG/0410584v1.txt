In this paper we investigate complex uniruled varieties X whose rational curves of minimal degree satisfy a special property. Namely, we assume that the tangent directions to such curves at a general point x\in X form a linear subspace of T_xX. As an application of our main result, we give a unified geometric proof of Mori's, Wahl's, Campana-Peternell's and Andreatta-Wi\'sniewski's characterizations of {\mathbb P}^n.
