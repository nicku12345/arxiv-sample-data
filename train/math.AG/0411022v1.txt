In this article we we continue the study of property N_p of irrational ruled surfaces begun in \cite{ES}. Let X be a ruled surface over a curve of genus g \geq 1 with a minimal section C_0 and the numerical invariant e.   When X is an elliptic ruled surface with e = -1, there is an elliptic curve E \subset X such that E \equiv 2C_0 -f. And we prove that if L \in {Pic}X is in the numerical class of aC_0 +bf and satisfies property N_p, then (C,L|_{C_0}) and (E,L|_E) satisfy property N_p and hence a+b \geq 3+p and a+2b \geq 3+p. This gives a proof of the relevant part of Gallego-Purnaprajna' conjecture in \cite{GP2}.   When g \geq 2 and e \geq 0 we prove some effective results about property N_p. Let L \in {Pic}X be a line bundle in the numerical class of aC_0 +bf. Our main result is about the relation between higher syzygies of (X,L) and those of (C,L_{C}) where L_C is the restriction of L to C_0. In particular, we show the followings: (1) If e \geq g-2 and b-ae \geq 3g-2, then L satisfies property N_p if and only if b-ae \geq 2g+1+p. (2) When C is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g \geq 2, L is normally generated if and only if b-ae \geq 2g+1 and normally presented if and only if b-ae \geq 2g+2. Also if e \geq g-2, then L satisfies property N_p if and only if a \geq 1 and b-ae \geq 2g+1+p.
