In this paper we consider coherent systems (E,V) on an elliptic curve which are stable with respect to some value of a parameter \alpha. We show that the corresponding moduli spaces, if non-empty, are smooth and irreducible of the expected dimenson. Moreover we give precise conditions for non-emptiness of the moduli spaces. Finally we study the variation of the moduli spaces with \alpha.
