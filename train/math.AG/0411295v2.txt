Here we introduce the concept of special effect varieties in higher dimension and we generalize to the n-dimensional projective space, n>=3, the two conjectures given in AG/0410527 for the planar case. Finally, we propose some examples on the product of projective spaces and we show how these results fit with the ones of Catalisano, Geramita and Gimigliano.
