Suppose that f defines a singular, complex affine hypersurface. If the critical locus of f is one-dimensional, we obtain new general bounds on the ranks of the homology groups of the Milnor fiber of f. This result has an interesting implication on the structure of the vanishing cycles in the category of perverse sheaves.
