Let f be a degeneration of Kahler manifolds. The local invariant cycle theorem states that for a smooth fiber of the degeneration, any cohomology class, invariant under the monodromy action, rises from a global cohomology class. Instead of the classical cohomology, one may consider the non-abelian cohomology. This note demonstrates that the analogous non-abelian version of the local invariant cycle theorem does not hold if the first non-abelian cohomology is the moduli space (universal categorical quotient) of the representations of the fundamental group.
