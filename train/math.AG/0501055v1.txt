The Kleiman-Mori cone plays important roles in the birational geometry. In this paper, we construct complete varieties whose Kleiman-Mori cones have interesting properties. First, we construct a simple and explicit example of complete non-projective singular varieties for which Kleiman's ampleness criterion does not hold. More precisely, we construct a complete non-projective toric variety X and a line bundle L on X such that L is positive on \bar {NE}(X)\setminus \{0\}. Next, we construct complete singular varieties X with NE(X)=N_1(X)\simeq \mathbb R^k for any k. These explicit examples seem to be missing in the literature.
