We study functions on the class group of a toric variety measuring the rates of growth of the cohomology groups of multiples of divisors. We show that these functions are piecewise polynomial with respect to finite polyhedral chamber decompositions. As applications, we express the self-intersection number of a T-Cartier divisor as a linear combination of the volumes of the bounded regions in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement and prove an asymptotic converse to Serre vanishing.
