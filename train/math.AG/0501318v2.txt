This is the final paper in a series of four, concerning the surface T \times T embedded in \mathbb{CP}^8, where T is a the one dimensional torus. In this paper we compute the fundamental group of the Galois cover of the surface with respect to a generic projection onto \mathbb{CP}^2, and show that it is nilpotent of class 3. This is the first time such a group is presented as the fundamental group of a Galois cover of a surface.
