When the quotient of a symplectic vector space by the action of a finite subgroup of symplectic automorphisms admits as a crepant projective resolution of singularities the Hilbert scheme of regular orbits of Nakamura, then there is a natural isomorphism between the Grothendieck group of this resolution and the representation ring of the group, given by the Bridgeland-King-Reid map. However, this isomorphism is not compatible with the ring structures. For the Hilbert scheme of points on the affine plane, we study the multiplicative behavior of this map.
