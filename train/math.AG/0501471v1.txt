Let \Cal E be a very ample vector bundle of rank two on a smooth complex projective threefold X. An inequality about the third Segre class of \Cal E is provided when K_X+\det \Cal E is nef but not big, and when a suitable positive multiple of K_X+\det \Cal E defines a morphism X\to B with connected fibers onto a smooth projective curve B, where K_X is the canonical bundle of X. As an application, the case where the genus of B is positive and \Cal E has a global section whose zero locus is a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus \geq 2 is investigated, and our previous result is improved for threefolds.
