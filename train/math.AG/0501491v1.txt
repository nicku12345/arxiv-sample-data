In this paper we define certain analogues of the volume of a divisor - called asymptotic cohomological functions - and investigate their behaviour on the Neron--Severi space. We establish that asymptotic cohomological functions are invariant with respect to the numerical equivalence of divisors, and that they give rise to continuous functions on the real Neron--Severi space. To illustrate the theory, we work out these invariants for abelian varieties, smooth surfaces, and certain homogeneous spaces.
