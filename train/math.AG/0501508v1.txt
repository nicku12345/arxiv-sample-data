Let k be a non-archimedean complete valued field and let X be a smooth Berkovich analytic k-curve. Let F be a finite locally constant \'{e}tale sheaf on k whose torsion is prime to the residue characteristic. We denote by |X| the underlying topological space and by \pi the canonical map from the \'{e}tale site to |X|. In this text we define a triangulation of X, we show that it always exists and use it to compute H^{0}(|X|,R^{q}\pi\_{*}F) and H^{1}(|X|,R^{q}\pi\_{*}F). If X is the analytification of an algebraic curve we give sufficient conditions so that those groups are isomorphic to their algebraic counterparts ; if the cohomology of k has a dualizing sheaf in some degree d (e.g k is p-adic, or k=C((t))) then we prove a duality theorem between H^{0}(|X|,R^{q}\pi\_{*}F) and H^{1}\_ {c}(|X|,R^{d+1}\pi\_{*}G) where G is the tensor product of the dual sheaf of F with the dualizing sheaf and the sheaf of n-th roots of unity.
