Bosio generalized the construction by Meersseman of a family of non-algebraic compact complex manifolds of any dimension. We establish a link between Bosio's construction and GIT quotients. We show that his generalization parallels exactly the extension from Mumford's GIT to the more general GIT developed by Bialynicki-Birula and Swiecicka. This gives new insights into the relationship between the two non-algebraic families, from which we obtain new results on their geometry.
