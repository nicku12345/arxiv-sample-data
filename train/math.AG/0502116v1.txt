We prove that the ascending chain condition (ACC) for log canonical (lc) thresholds in dimension d and Special Termination in dimension d imply the termination of any sequence of log flips starting with a d-dimensional lc pair of nonnegative Kodaira dimension. In particular, in characteristic zero, the latter termination in dimension 4 follows from Alexeev-Borisov's conjecture in dimension 3.
