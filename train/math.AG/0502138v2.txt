Given an abelian variety X and a point a\in X we denote by <a> the closure of the subgroup of X generated by a. Let N=2^g-1. We denote by \kappa: X\to \kappa(X)\subset\mathbb P^N the map from X to its Kummer variety. We prove that an indecomposable abelian variety X is the Jacobian of a curve if and only if there exists a point a=2b\in X\setminus\{0\} such that <a> is irreducible and \kappa(b) is a flex of \kappa(X).
