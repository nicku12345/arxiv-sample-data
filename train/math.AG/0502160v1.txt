This is, mostly, a survey of results about the birational geometry of rationally connected manifolds, using rational curves analogous to lines in {\mathbb P}^n ({\it quasi-lines}). Various characterizations of a Zariski neighbourhood of a line in {\mathbb P}^n are obtained, some of them being new. Also, methods of formal geometry are applied for deducing results of birational nature.
