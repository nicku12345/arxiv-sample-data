In these notes we investigate the cone of nef curves of projective varieties, which is the dual cone to the cone of pseudo-effective divisors. We prove a structure theorem for the cone of nef curves of projective \mathbb Q-factorial klt pairs of arbitrary dimension from the point of view of the Minimal Model Program. This is a generalization of Batyrev's structure theorem for the cone of nef curves of projective terminal threefolds.
