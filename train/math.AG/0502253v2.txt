Let \mathcal{X} be a tame proper Deligne-Mumford stack of the form [M/G] where M is a scheme and G is an algebraic group. We prove that the stack \mathcal{K}_{g,n}(\mathcal{X},d) of twisted stable maps is a quotient stack and can be embedded into a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack. When G is finite, we give a more precise construction of \mathcal{K}_{g,n}(\mathcal{X},d) using Hilbert schemes and admissible G-covers.
