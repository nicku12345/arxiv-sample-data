We study the global structure of moduli spaces of quasi-isogenies of p-divisible groups introduced by Rapoport and Zink. We determine their dimensions and their sets of connected components and of irreducible components. If the isocrystals of the p-divisible groups are simple, we compute the cohomology of the moduli space. As an application we determine which moduli spaces are smooth.
