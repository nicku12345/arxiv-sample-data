Let X_P be a smooth projective toric variety of dimension n embedded in \PP^r using all of the lattice points of the polytope P. We compute the dimension and degree of the secant variety \Sec X_P. We also give explicit formulas in dimensions 2 and 3 and obtain partial results for the projective varieties X_A embedded using a set of lattice points A \subset P\cap\ZZ^n containing the vertices of P and their nearest neighbors.
