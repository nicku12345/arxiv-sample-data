A notion of Poincar\'e series was introduced by A.Campillo et al. It was developed by Delgado and Gusein-Zade for a multi-index filtration corresponding to the sequence of blow-ups. The present paper suggests the way to generalize the notion of Poincar\'e series to the case of arbitrary locally free sheaf on the modification of complex plane \mathbb{C}^2.   This series is expressed through the topological invariants of the sheaf. For the sheaf of holomorphic functions the answer coincides with the Poincar\'e series found before.
