Let k be a perfect field of characteristic p >0, U be a variety over k and F be a power of Frobenius.   We construct the category of overholonomic arithmetical (F-)\D-modules over U and the category of overholonomic (F-)complexes over U. We prove that overholonomic complexes over U are stables by direct images, inverse images, extraordinary inverse images, extraordinary direct images, dual functors. Moreover, in the smooth case, we check that unit-root overconvergent F-isocrystals are overholonomic. In particular, they are holonomic.
