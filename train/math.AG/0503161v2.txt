Using the \sharp-minimal model program of uniruled varieties we show that for any pair (X, \H) consisting of a reduced and irreducible variety X of dimension k \geq 3 and a globally generated big line bundle \H on X with d:= \H^k and n:= h^0(X, \H)-1 such that d<2(n-k)-4, then X is uniruled of \H-degree one, except if (k,d,n)=(3,27,19) and a {\sharp}-minimal model of (X, \H) is (\PP^3,\O_{\PP^3}(3)). We also show that the bound is optimal for threefolds.
