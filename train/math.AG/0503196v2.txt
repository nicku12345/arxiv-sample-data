Let G be a connected affine algebraic group and X a regular G-variety (in the sense of Bifet-De Concini-Procesi) with open orbit G/H and boundary divisor D. We show the vanishing of the G-equivariant Chern classes of the bundle of differential forms on X with logarithmic poles along D, in degrees larger than \dim(X) - \rk(G) + \rk(H). Our motivation comes from Gieseker's degeneration method to prove the Newstead-Ramanan conjecture on the vanishing of the top Chern classes of the moduli space of stable vector bundles on a curve.
