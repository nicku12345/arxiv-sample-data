To any dg-category T (over some base ring k), we define a D^{-}-stack \mathcal{M}_{T} in the sense of \cite{hagII}, classifying certain T^{op}-dg-modules. When T is saturated, \mathcal{M}_{T} classifies compact objects in the triangulated category [T] associated to T. The main result of this work states that under certain finiteness conditions on T (e.g. if it is saturated) the D^{-}-stack \mathcal{M}_{T} is locally geometric (i.e. union of open and geometric sub-stacks). As a consequence we prove the algebraicity of the group of auto-equivalences of a saturated dg-category. We also obtain the existence of reasonable moduli for perfect complexes on a smooth and proper scheme, as well as complexes of representations of a finite quiver.
