The moduli space \mathscr{M} of surfaces of general type with p_g=q=1, K^2=g=3 (where g is the genus of the Albanese fibration) was constructed by Catanese and Ciliberto in \cite{CaCi93}. In this paper we characterize the subvariety \mathscr{M}_2 \subset \mathscr{M} corresponding to surfaces containing a genus 2 pencil, and moreover we show that there exists a non-empty, dense subset \mathscr{M}^0 \subset \mathscr{M} which parametrizes isomorphism classes of surfaces with birational bicanonical map.
