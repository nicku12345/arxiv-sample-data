In the present paper we consider fibrations f: S \ra B of an algebraic surface onto a curve B, with general fibre a curve of genus g. Our main results are:   1) A structure theorem for such fibrations in the case g=2   2) A structure theorem for such fibrations in the case g=3 and general fibre nonhyperelliptic   3) A theorem giving a complete description of the moduli space of minimal surfaces of general type with  K^2_S = 3, p_g = q=1, showing in particular that it has four unirational connected components   4) some other applications of the two structure theorems.
