This is an expository paper on rationally connected varieties. The aim is to provide an introduction to the subject, as well as to discuss a recent result by T. Graber, J. Harris and J. Starr. The paper is based on the talk I gave at the 2004 Summer Research Conference on Algebraic Geometry at Snowbird.
