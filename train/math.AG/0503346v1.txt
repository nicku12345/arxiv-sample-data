In this paper we are interested in proving that the infinitesimal variations of Hodge structure of hypersurfaces of high enough degree lie in a proper subvariety of the variety of all infinitesimal variations. This is proved using a space of symmetrizers as defined by Donagi, to identify a geometric structure carried by the variety of all infinitesimal variations of Hodge structure.
