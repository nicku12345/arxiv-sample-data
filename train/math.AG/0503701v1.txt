The main goal of the paper is to find an effective estimation for the minimal number of generic points in \mathbb K^2 for which the basis for Hermite interpolation consists of the first \ell terms (with respect to total degree ordering). As a result we prove that the space of plane curves of degree d having generic singularities of multiplicity \leq m has the expected dimension if the number of low order singularities (of multiplicity k\leq12) is greater then some r(m,k). Additionally, the upper bounds for r(m,k) are given.
