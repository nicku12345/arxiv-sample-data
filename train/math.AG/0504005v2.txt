Let A subset R^n be a set-germ at 0 in R^n such that 0 is in the closure of A. Let D(A) denote the set of all directions of A at 0 in R^n. Let A, B subsets R^n be subanalytic set-germs at 0 in R^n such that 0 belongs to their closure. We study the problem of whether the dimension of the common direction set, called their kissing dimension, is preserved by a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. We show that in general it is not preserved. We prove that the kissing dimension is preserved if the images of the subanalytic sets under consideration are also subanalytic. In particular, if two subanalytic set-germs are bi-Lipschitz equivalent, then their direction sets must have the same dimension.
