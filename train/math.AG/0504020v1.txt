We develop in detail most of the theory of the Picard scheme that Grothendieck sketched in two Bourbaki talks and in commentaries on them. Also, we review in brief much of the rest of the theory developed by Grothendieck and by others. But we begin with a twelve-page historical introduction, which traces the development of the ideas from Bernoulli to Grothendieck, and which may appeal to a wider audience.
