We study the exterior product on 0-cycles modulo rational equivalence, and prove some nonvanishing results. The main tools used are higher cycle- and Abel-Jacobi- classes developed in articles of J. Lewis and the author. A theorem of Rosenschon-Saito (in the case of 0-cycles) is a special case of our results.
