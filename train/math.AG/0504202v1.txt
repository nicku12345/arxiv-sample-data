Moduli spaces of semistable sheaves on a K3 or abelian surface with respect to a general ample divisor are shown to be locally factorial, with the exception of symmetric products of a K3 or abelian surface and the class of moduli spaces found by O'Grady. Consequently, since singular moduli space that do not belong to these exceptional cases have singularities in codimension \geq4 they do no admit projective symplectic resolutions.
