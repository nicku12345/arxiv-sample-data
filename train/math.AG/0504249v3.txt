Motivated by several recent results on the geometry of the moduli spaces \bar{\Cal M}_{g,n} of stable curves of genus g with n marked points, here we determine their birational structure for small values of g and n by exploiting suitable plane models of the general curve. More precisely, we show that {\Cal M}_{g,n} is rational for g=2 and 1\le n\le 12, g=3 and 1\le n\le 14, g=4 and 1\le n\le 15, g=5 and 1\le n\le 12.
