Suppose that f defines a singular, complex affine hypersurface. If the critical locus of f is one-dimensional at the origin, we obtain new general bounds on the ranks of the homology groups of the Milnor fiber, F_{f, \mathbf 0}, of f at the origin, with either integral or \mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z coefficients. If the critical locus of f has arbitrary dimension, we show that the smallest possibly non-zero reduced Betti number of F_{f, \mathbf 0} completely determines if f defines a family of isolated singularities, over a smooth base, with constant Milnor number. This result has a nice interpretation in terms of the structure of the vanishing cycles as an object in the perverse category.
