We show that the number of tropical curves of given genus and degree through some given general points in the plane does not depend on the position of the points. In the case when the degree of the curves contains only primitive integral vectors this statement has been known for a while now, but the only known proof was indirect with the help of Mikhalkin's Correspondence Theorem that translates this question into the well-known fact that the numbers of complex curves in a toric surface through some given points do not depend on the position of the points. This paper presents a direct proof entirely within tropical geometry that is in addition applicable to arbitrary degree of the curves.
