Let M be the moduli space of SO(r)-bundles on a curve, and L the determinant bundle on M. We define an isomorphism of H^0(M,L) onto the dual of the space of r-th order theta functions on the Jacobian of C. This isomorphism identifies the map M -->|L|* defined by the linear system |L| with the map M -->|r Theta| which associates to a quadratic bundle (E,q) the Theta divisor of the vector bundle E . The two components M+ and M- of M are mapped into the subspaces of even and odd theta functions respectively. Finally we discuss the analogous question for Sp(2r)-bundles.
