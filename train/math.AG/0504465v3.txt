We compute the expected dimension of the moduli space of torsion-free rank 2 sheaves at a point corresponding to a stable reflexive sheaf and give conditions for the existence of a perfect tangent-obstruction complex on a class of smooth projective threefolds; this class includes Fano and Calabi-Yau threefolds. We also explore both local and global relationships between moduli spaces of reflexive rank 2 sheaves and the Hilbert scheme of curves.
