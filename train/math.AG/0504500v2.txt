Let X be a smooth proper genus 2 curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. The absolute Frobenius induces a rational map F on the the moduli space M\_X of semi-stable rank 2 vector bundles over X, which is isomorphic to a 3-dimensional projective space. Y. Laszlo and C. Pauly recently gave the equations of F for an ordinary X. Using deformation, we give these equations for a supersingular X and draw some consequences such as the base locus of F (one point), or the stability of the complementary Zariski open set.
