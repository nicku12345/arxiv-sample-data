We give a presentation for the Chow ring of the moduli space of degree two stable maps from two-pointed rational curves to P^1. Also, integrals of of all degree four monomials in the hyperplane pullbacks and boundary divisors of this ring are computed using equivariant intersection theory. Finally, the presentation is used to give a new computation of the (previously known) values of the genus zero, degree two, two-pointed gravitational correlators of P^1. This article is a sequel to math.AG/0501322, although the only information truly needed from that article is the Poincare polynomial of the moduli space under consideration.
