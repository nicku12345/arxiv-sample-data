Fix integers r,s_1,...,s_l such that 1\leq l\leq r-1 and s_l\geq r-l+1, and let \Cal C(r;s_1,...,s_l) be the set of all integral, projective and nondegenerate curves C of degree s_1 in the projective space \bold P^r, such that, for all i=2,...,l, C does not lie on any integral, projective and nondegenerate variety of dimension i and degree <s_i. We say that a curve C satisfies the {\it{flag condition}} (r;s_1,...,s_l) if C belongs to \Cal C(r;s_1,...,s_l). Define  G(r;s_1,...,s_l)=max\left\{p_a(C): C\in \Cal C(r;s_1,...,s_l)\right \},  where p_a(C) denotes the arithmetic genus of C. In the present paper, under the hypothesis s_1>>...>>s_l, we prove that a curve C satisfying the flag condition (r;s_1,...,s_l) and of maximal arithmetic genus p_a(C)=G(r;s_1,...,s_l) must lie on a unique flag such as C=V_{s_1}^{1}\subset V_{s_2}^{2}\subset ... \subset V_{s_l}^{l}\subset {\bold P^r}, where, for any i=1,...,l, V_{s_i}^i denotes an integral projective subvariety of {\bold P^r} of degree s_i and dimension i, such that its general linear curve section satisfies the flag condition (r-i+1;s_i,...,s_l) and has maximal arithmetic genus G(r-i+1;s_i,...,s_l). This proves the existence of a sort of a hierarchical structure of the family of curves with maximal genus verifying flag conditions.
