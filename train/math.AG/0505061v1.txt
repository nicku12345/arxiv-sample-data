Let X be a projective manifold. Let Y_1,...,Y_{p+1} be p+1 ample hypersurfaces in complete intersection position on X, each defined by the global section of an ample Cartier divisor. We show in this note that for i\le p+1, the cohomology groups H^i(\Omega^q) can be computed as the i-th cohomology groups of some complex of global sections of locally residual currents on X. We could also compute the cohomology of the subsheaves {\tilde\Omega}^q\subset \Omega^q of \partial-closed holomorphic forms by the corresponding subsheaves of \partial-closed locally residual currents. We deduce like this that any cohomology class of bidegree (i,i) has an element which is a d-closed locally residual current with support in Y_1\cap >...\cap Y_i. We also show that any locally residual current T of bidegree (q,i-1) with support in Y_1\cap ... Y_{i-1} can be written as a global residue T=Res_{Y_1,...,Y_{i-1}}{\Psi} of some meromorphic form with pole in Y_1\cup...\cup Y_{i}. We can avoid Y_{i} iff the current in \bar\partial-exact; we deduce as corollaries a theorem of Hererra-Dickenstein-Sessa. We give as a conclusion a new formulation of the Hodge conjecture.
