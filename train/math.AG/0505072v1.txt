Given a reductive algebraic group G and a finite dimensional algebraic G-module V, we study how close is the algebra of G-invariant polynomials on V^{\oplus n} to the subalgebra generated by polarizations of G-invariant polynomials on V. We address this problem in a more general setting of G-actions on arbitrary affine varieties.
