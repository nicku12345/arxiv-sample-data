Regarding the resolution of singularities for the differential equations of Painlev\'e type, there are important differences between the second-order Painlev\'e equations and those of higher order. Unlike the second-order case, in higher order cases there may exist some meromorphic solution spaces with codimension 2. In this paper, we will give an explicit global resolution of singularities for a 3-parameter family of third-order differential systems with meromorphic solution spaces of codimension 2.
