We find and study coupled Painlev\'e II systems in dimension 4, which can be obtained by a degeneration from the systems of type {A_4}^{(1)}. We compare these systems with other types of coupled Painlev\'e II systems from the viewpoint of the local index. We also give the phase spaces for these systems.
