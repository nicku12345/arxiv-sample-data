We study the monodromy of vanishing cycles for map-germs f:(C^{2n},0) \to (\CM^k,0) whose components are in involution. Although the singular fibres of such maps have non-isolated singularities, it is shown that the regular fibres are 2(n-k)-connected and that the vanishing homology group of rank 2(n-k)+1 is freely generated by the vanishing cycles. As corollaries, we get that the multiplicity of the discriminant is equal to the dimension of the vanishing homology group of rank 2(n-k)+1 and that the Variation operator is an isomorphism. These results are proved under two assumptions: 1. the pyramidality assumptions which states that the singular locus is propagated along the Hamilton flow of the components of f 2. the generic singular fibres should have transverse Morse singularities and their locus should be connected. It is conjectured that outside a set of infinite codimension the first condition holds and that there exists an involutive deformation of f which satisfies condition 2.
