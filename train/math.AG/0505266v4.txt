In this paper, we study the Brill-Noether theory of the normalizations of singular, irreducible curves on a K3 surface. We introduce a {\em singular} Brill-Noether number \rho_{sing} and show that if the Picard group of the K3 surface is {\mathbb Z} [L], there are no g^r_d's on the normalizations of irreducible curves in |L|, provided that \rho_{sing} <0.   We give examples showing the sharpness of this result. We then focus on the case of {\em hyperelliptic normalizations}, and classify linear systems |L| containing irreducible nodal curves with hyperelliptic normalizations, for \rho_{sing}<0, without any assumption on its Picard group.
