We are interested in those bundles C on \mathbb{P}^N which admit a resolution of the form  0 \to \mathbb{C}^s \otimes E \xrightarrow{\mu} \mathbb{C}^t \otimes F \to C \to 0. In this paper we prove that, under suitable conditions on (E,F), a generic bundle with this form is either simple or canonically decomposable. As applications we provide an easy criterion for the stability of such bundles on \mathbb{P}^2 and we prove the stability when E = \mathcal{O}, F = \mathcal{O}(1) and C is an exceptional bundle on \mathbb{P}^N for N \geq 2.
