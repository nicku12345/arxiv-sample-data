We introduce a smooth projective variety T_{d,n} which compactifies the space of configurations of n distinct points on affine d-space modulo translation and homothety. The points in the boundary correspond to n-pointed stable rooted trees of d-dimensional projective spaces, which for d = 1, are (n+1)-pointed stable rational curves. In particular, T_{1,n} is isomorphic to \bar{M}_{0,n+1}, the moduli space of such curves. The variety T_{d,n} shares many properties with \bar{M}_{0,n}. For example, as we prove, the boundary is a smooth normal crossings divisor whose components are products of T_{d,i} for i < n, it has an inductive construction analogous to but differing from Keel's for \bar{M}_{0,n} which can be used to describe its Chow groups, Chow motive and Poincar\'e polynomials, generalizing \cite{Keel,Man:GF}. We give a presentation of the Chow rings of T_{d,n}, exhibit explicit dual bases for the dimension 1 and codimension 1 cycles. The variety T_{d,n} is embedded in the Fulton-MacPherson spaces X[n] for \textit{any} smooth variety X and we use this connection in a number of ways. For example, to give a family of ample divisors on T_{d,n} and to give an inductive presentation of the Chow groups and the Chow motive of X[n] analogous to Keel's presentation for \bar{M}_{0,n}, solving a problem posed by Fulton and MacPherson.
