For the Galois closure \Xgal of a generic projection from a surface X, it is believed that \pi_1(\Xgal) gives rise to new invariants of X. However, in all examples this group is surprisingly simple. In this article, we offer an explanation for this phenomenon: We compute a quotient of \pi_1(\Xgal) that depends on \pi_1(X) and data from the generic projection only. In all known examples except one, this quotient is in fact isomorphic to \pi_1(\Xgal). As a byproduct, we simplify part of the computations of Moishezon, Teicher and others.
