Let Hilb P^3 denote the Hilbert scheme of smooth connected curves in P^3. We consider maximal irreducible closed subsets W \subset Hilb P^3 whose general member C is contained in a smooth cubic surface and investigate the conditions for W to be a component of (Hilb P^3)_{red}. We especially study the case where the dimension of the tangent space of Hilb P^3 at [C] is greater than \dim W by one. We compute obstructions to deforming C in P^3 and prove that for every W in this case, Hilb P^3 is non-reduced along W and W is a component of (Hilb P^3)_{red}.
