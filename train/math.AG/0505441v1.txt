In a previous paper, math.AG/0409419, we described six families of K3-surfaces with Picard-number 19, and we identified surfaces with Picard-number 20. In these notes we classify some of the surfaces by computing their transcendental lattices. Moreover we show that the surfaces with Picard-number 19 are birational to a Kummer surface which is the quotient of a non-product type abelian surface by an involution.
