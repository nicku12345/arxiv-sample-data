Let M_{d}(\P^r) be the space of (r+1)-tuples (f_0,...,f_r) modulo homothety, where f_0,...,f_r are homogeneous polynomials of degree d in two variables. Let M_{d}^{\circ}(\P^r) be the open subset of M_{d}(\P^r) such that f_0,...,f_r have no common zeros. Then M_{d}^{\circ}(\P^r) parametrizes the space of holomorphic maps of degree d from \P^1 into \P^r. In general the boundary divisor M_{d}(\P^r) \setminus M_{d}^{\circ}(\P^r) is not normal crossing. In this paper we will give a natural stratification of this boundary and show that we can process an iterated blow-ups along these strata (or its proper transformations) to obtain a compactification of M_{d}^{\circ}(\P^n) with normal crossing divisors.
