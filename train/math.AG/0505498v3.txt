In Asterisque 271 the authors introduced the notion of ind-sheaf, and defined the six Grothendieck operations in this framework. They defined subanalytic sheaves and they obtained the formalism of the six Grothendieck operations by including subanalytic sheaves into the category of ind-sheaves. The aim of this paper is to give a direct construction of the six Grothendieck operations in the framework of subanalytic sites avoiding the heavy theory of ind-sheaves. As an application we show how to recover the subanalytic sheaves of temperate and Whitney holomorphic functions.
