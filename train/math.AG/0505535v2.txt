We consider the natural action of a finite group on the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces which induces a duality defined by Mukai for surfaces of this type. We show that the group permutes polarized Fourier-Mukai partners of polarized K3 surfaces and we study the divisors in the fixed loci of the elements of this finite group.
