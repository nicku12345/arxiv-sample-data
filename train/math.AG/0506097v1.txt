The parametric degree of a rational surface is the degree of the polynomials in the smallest possible proper parametrization. An example shows that the parametric degree is not a geometric but an arithmetic concept, in the sense that it depends on the choice of the ground field. In this paper, we introduce two geometrical invariants of a rational surface, namely level and keel. These two numbers govern the parametric degree in the sense that there exist linear upper and lower bounds.
