It is known that the algebraic \deRham cohomology group \hDR{i}(X_0/\Q) of a nonsingular variety X_0/\Q has the same rank as the rational singular cohomology group \h^i\sing(\Xh;\Q) of the complex manifold \Xh associated to the base change X_0\times_{\Q}\C. However, we do not have a natural isomorphism \hDR{i}(X_0/\Q)\iso\h^i\sing(\Xh;\Q). Any choice of such an isomorphism produces certain integrals, so called periods, which reveal valuable information about X_0. The aim of this thesis is to explain these classical facts in detail. Based on an approach of Kontsevich, different definitions of a period are compared and their properties discussed. Finally, the theory is applied to some examples. These examples include a representation of \zeta(2) as a period and a variation of mixed Hodge structures used by Goncharov.
