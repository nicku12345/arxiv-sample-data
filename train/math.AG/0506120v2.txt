In this note we define moduli functors of (primitively) polarized K3 spaces. We show that they are representable by Deligne-Mumford stacks over Spec(Z). Further, we look at K3 spaces with a level structure. Our main result is that the moduli functors of K3 spaces with a primitive polarization of degree 2d and a level structure are representable by smooth algebraic spaces over open parts of Spec(Z). To do this we use ideas of Grothendieck, Deligne, Mumford, Artin and others.   These results are the starting point for the theory of complex multiplication for K3 surfaces and the definition of Kuga-Satake abelian varieties in positive characteristic given in our Ph.D. thesis.
