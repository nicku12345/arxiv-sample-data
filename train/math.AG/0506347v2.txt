This paper introduces a mathematical definition of the category of D-branes in Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds in terms of A_\infty-categories. Our categories coincide with the categories of (graded) matrix factorizations for quasi-homogeneous polynomials. After setting up the necessary definitions, we prove that our category for the polynomial x^{n+1} is equivalent to the derived category of representations of the Dynkin quiver of type A_{n}. We also construct a special stability condition for the triangulated category in the sense of T. Bridgeland, which should be the "origin" of the space of stability conditions.
