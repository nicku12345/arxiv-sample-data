We show that the equivariant Chow cohomology ring of a toric variety is naturally isomorphic to the ring of integral piecewise polynomial functions on the associated fan. This gives a large class of singular spaces for which localization holds in equivariant Chow cohomology with integer coefficients. We also compute the equivariant Chow cohomology of toric prevarieties and general complex hypertoric varieties in terms of piecewise polynomial functions.
