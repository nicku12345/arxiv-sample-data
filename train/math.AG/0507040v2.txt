We describe new autoequivalences of derived categories of coherent sheaves arising from what we call \mathbb P^n-objects of the category. Standard examples arise from holomorphic symplectic manifolds. Under mirror symmetry these autoequivalences should be mirror to Seidel's Dehn twists about lagrangian \mathbb P^n submanifolds.   We give various connections to spherical objects and spherical twists, and include a simple description of Atiyah and Kodaira-Spencer classes in an appendix.
