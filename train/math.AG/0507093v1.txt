We show that the log canonical bundle, \kappa, of \bar M_{0,n} is very ample, show the homogeneous coordinate ring is Koszul, and give a nice set of rank 4 quadratic generators for the homogeneous ideal: The embedding is equivariant for the symmetric group, and the image lies on many Segre embedded copies of P^1 \times P^2 \times ... \times P^{n-3}, permuted by the symmetric group. The homogeneous ideal of \bar M_{0,n} is the sum of the homogeneous ideals of these Segre embeddings.
