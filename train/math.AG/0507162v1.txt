Let C\subset \bold P^r be an integral projective curve. One defines the speciality index e(C) of C as the maximal integer t such that h^0(C,\omega_C(-t))>0, where \omega_C denotes the dualizing sheaf of C. Extending a classical result of Halphen concerning the speciality of a space curve, in the present paper we prove that if C\subset \bold P^5 is an integral degree d curve not contained in any surface of degree < s, in any threefold of degree <t, and in any fourfold of degree <u, and if d>>s>>t>>u\geq 1, then  e(C)\leq {\frac{d}{s}}+{\frac{s}{t}}+{\frac{t}{u}}+u-6.  Moreover equality holds if and only if C is a complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degrees u, {\frac{t}{u}}, {\frac{s}{t}} and {\frac{d}{s}}. We give also some partial results in the general case C\subset \bold P^r, r\geq 3.
