Let (X,x) be an isolated complete intersection singularity and let f : (X,x) \to (\CC,0) be the germ of an analytic function with an isolated singularity at x. An important topological invariant in this situation is the Picard-Lefschetz monodromy operator associated to f. We give a survey on what is known about this operator. In particular, we review methods of computation of the monodromy and its eigenvalues (zeta function), results on the Jordan normal form of it, definition and properties of the spectrum, and the relation between the monodromy and the topology of the singularity.
