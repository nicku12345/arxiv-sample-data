We generalize Givental's Theorem for complete intersections in smooth toric varieties in the Fano case. In particular, we find Gromov--Witten invariants of Fano varieties of dimension \geq 3, which are complete intersections in weighted projective spaces and singular toric varieties. We generalize the Riemann-Roch equations to weighted projective spaces. We compute counting matrices of smooth Fano threefolds with Picard group Z and anticanonical degrees 2, 8, and 16.
