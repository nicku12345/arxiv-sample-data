This paper provides some technical results needed in "Formalism for Relative Gromov-Witten Invariants." We study line-bundles on the moduli stacks of relative stable and rubber maps that are used to define relative Gromov-Witten invariants in the sense of J. Li. Relations between these line-bundles yield degeneration formulae. In addition we prove a technical result called the Trivial Cylinders Theorem.
