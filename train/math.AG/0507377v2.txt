The Shapiro conjecture in the real Schubert calculus, while likely true for Grassmannians, fails to hold for flag manifolds, but in a very interesting way. We give a refinement of the Shapiro conjecture for the flag manifold and present massive (15.76 gigahertz-years) computational experimentation in support of this refined conjecture.   We also prove the conjecture in some special cases using discriminants and establish relationships between different cases of the conjecture.
