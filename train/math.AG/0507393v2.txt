It is well-known that the intersection multiplicities of Schubert classes in the Grassmanian are Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We generalize this statement in the context of quiver representations. Here the intersection multiplicity of Schubert classes is replaced by the number of subrepresentations of a general quiver reprsentation, and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are replaced by the the dimension of a certain space of semiinvariants.
