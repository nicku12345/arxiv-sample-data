In this paper we study the problem of density in (1,3] for the Chern ratio of surfaces with ample cotangent bundle. In particular we prove density in (1,2) by constructing a family of complete intersection surfaces in a product of varieties with big cotangent bundle. We also analyse the case of complete intersections in a product of curves of genus at least 2.
