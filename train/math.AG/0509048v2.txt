We study the space of stability conditions \Stab(X) on the non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold X which is the total space of the canonical bundle of \PP^2. We give a combinatorial description of an open subset of \Stab(X) and state a conjecture relating \Stab(X) to the Frobenius manifold obtained from the quantum cohomology of \PP^2. We give some evidence from mirror symmetry for this conjecture.
