We generalize the Harnack-Thom theorem to relate the ranks of the Lawson homology groups with \Z_2-coefficients of a real quasiprojective variety with the ranks of its reduced real Lawson homology groups. In the case of zero-cycle group, we recover the classical Harnack-Thom theorem and generalize the classical version to include real quasiprojective varieties. We use Weil's construction of Picard varieties to construct reduced real Picard groups, and Milnor's construction of universal bundles to construct some weak models of classifying spaces of some cycle groups. These weak models are used to produce long exact sequences of homotopy groups which are the main tool in computing the homotopy groups of some cycle groups of divisors. We obtain some congruences involving the Picard number of a nonsingular real projective variety and the rank of its reduced real Lawson homology groups of divisors.
