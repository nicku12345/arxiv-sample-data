We apply the methods of C{\u{a}}ld{\u{a}}raru to construct a twisted Fourier-Mukai transform between a pair of holomorphic symplectic four-folds. More precisely, we obtain an equivalence between the derived category of coherent sheaves on a certain four-fold and the derived category of twisted sheaves on its `mirror' partner. As corollaries, we show that the two spaces are connected by a one-parameter family of deformations through Lagrangian fibrations, and we extend the original Fourier-Mukai transform to degenerations of abelian surfaces.
