Let X\to\P^n be a 2n-dimensional projective holomorphic symplectic manifold admitting a Lagrangian fibration over \P^n. Matsushita proved that the fibration can be deformed in a codimension one family in the moduli space \mathrm{Def}(X) of deformations of X. We extend his result by proving that if the Lagrangian fibration admits a section, then there is a codimension two family of deformations which also preserve the section.
