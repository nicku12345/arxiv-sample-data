Microlocal perverse sheaves form a stack on the cotangent bundle of a complex manifold that is the analogue of the stack of perverse sheaves on the manifold itself. We give an embedding of the stack of microlocal perverse sheaves into a simpler stack on the cotangent bundle which we call melded Morse systems. The category of melded Morse systems is elementary, in the sense that an object is a collection of vector spaces and a collection of linear maps between them satisfying certain composition relations.
