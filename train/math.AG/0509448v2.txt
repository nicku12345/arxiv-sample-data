Let \V be a mixed characteristic complete discrete valuation ring, let \X and \Y be two smooth formal \V-schemes, let f_0 : X \to Y be a projective morphism between their special fibers, let T be a divisor of Y such that T_X := f_0 ^{-1} (T)  is a divisor of X and let \M \in D ^\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{coh} (\D ^\dag_{\X} (\hdag T_X)_{\Q}). We construct the relative duality isomorphism  f_{0T +} \circ \DD_{\X, T_X} (\M) \riso \DD_{\Y, T} \circ f_{0T +} (\M). This generalizes the known case when there exists a lifting f : \X \to \Y of f_{0}. Moreover, when f_0 is a closed immersion, we prove that this isomorphism commutes with Frobenius.
