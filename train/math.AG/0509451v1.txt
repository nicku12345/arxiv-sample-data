We give the first (as far as we know) complete description of the boundary of the Milnor fiber for some non-isolated singular germs of surfaces in {\bf C}^3. We study irreducible (i.e. gcd (m,k,l) = 1) non-isolated (i.e. 1 \leq k < l) Hirzebruch hypersurface singularities in {\bf C}^3 given by the equation z^m - x^ky^l = 0. We show that the boundary L of the Milnor fiber is always a Seifert manifold and we give an explicit description of the Seifert structure. From it, we deduce that :   1) L is never diffeomorphic to the boundary of the normalization.   2) L is a lens space iff m = 2 and k = 1.   3) When L is not a lens space, it is never orientation preserving diffeomorphic to the boundary of a normal surface singularity.
