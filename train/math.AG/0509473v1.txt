A recollement of triangulated categories makes it possible to view one such category as being glued together from two others.   The prototypical example is that D(X), a suitable derived category of sheaves on the topological space X, has a recollement in terms of D(Z) and D(U) when Z is a closed subset of X and U is the open complement.   This note gives a different, "wrong way" recollement in the scheme case.
