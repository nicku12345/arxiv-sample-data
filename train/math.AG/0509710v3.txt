Let X \subset \P^r be a nondegenerate projective variety and let \nu_{\ell} : \P^r \to \P^N be the \ell-th Veronese embedding. In this paper we study the higher normality, defining equations and syzygies among them for the projective embedding \nu_{\ell} (X) \subset \P^N. We obtain that for a very ample line bundle L \in {Pic}X such that X \subset \P H^0 (X,L) is m-regular in the sense of Castelnuovo-Mumford, (X,L^{\ell}) satisfies property N_{\ell} for all \ell \geq m (Theorem \ref{thm:main1}). This is a generalization of M. Green's work that (\P^r,\mathcal{O}_{\P^r} (\ell)) satisfies property N_{\ell}. Also our result refines works of Ein-Lazarsfeld in \cite{EL}, Gallego-Purnaprajna in \cite{GP} and E. Rubei in \cite{Rubei1}, \cite{Rubei} and \cite{Ru1}.
