This is an introduction to topology of complement to plane curves and hypersurfaces in the projective space and is based on the lectures given in Lumini in February and in ICTP (Trieste) in August of 2005. We discuss key problems concerning the families of singular curves, the one variable Alexander polynomials and the module over ring of Laurent polynomials structure on the homotopy groups of the complements to hypersurfaces with isolated singularities. We also discuss multivariable generalizations of these invariants and the Hodge theory of infinite abelian covers used in calculations of multivariable invariants. A historical overview is included as the opening section
