This is a local version of math.AG/0506534. We shall deal with the deformation of a convex symplectic variety X instead of a projective one. The usual deformation does not work well in the convex case. Instead, we regard X as a Poisson scheme and study its Poisson deformation. One of the application is the following:   Let Y be an affine symplectic variety, and assume that Y has two Q-factorial crepant terminalizations X and X'. If X is non-singular, then X' is non-singular, too. Moreover, when Y has a good C^*-action, X and X' have the same kind of singularities.
