We investigate the existence of Lagrangian fibrations on the generalized Kummer varieties of Beauville. For a principally polarized abelian surface A of Picard number one we find the following: The Kummer variety K^n(A) is birationally equivalent to another irreducible symplectic variety admitting a Lagrangian fibration, if and only if n is a perfect square. And this is the case if and only if K^n(A) carries a divisor with vanishing Beauville-Bogomolov square.
