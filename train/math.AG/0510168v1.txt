We complete the study of birational geometry of Fano fiber spaces \pi\colon V\to {\mathbb P}^1, the fiber of which is a Fano double hypersurface of index 1. For each family of these varieties we either prove birational rigidity or produce explicitly non-trivial structures of Fano fiber spaces. A new linear method of studying movable systems on Fano fiber spaces V/{\mathbb P}^1 is developed.
