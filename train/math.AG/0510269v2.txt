We construct a locally geometric \infty-stack M_{Hod}(X,Perf) of perfect complexes with \lambda-connection structure on a smooth projective variety X. This maps to A ^1 / G_m, so it can be considered as the Hodge filtration of its fiber over 1 which is M_{DR}(X,Perf), parametrizing complexes of D_X-modules which are O_X-perfect. We apply the result of Toen-Vaquie that Perf(X) is locally geometric. The proof of geometricity of the map M_{Hod}(X,Perf) \to Perf(X) uses a Hochschild-like notion of weak complexes of modules over a sheaf of rings of differential operators. We prove a strictification result for these weak complexes, and also a strictification result for complexes of sheaves of O-modules over the big crystalline site.
