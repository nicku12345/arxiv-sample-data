Let \mathcal{V} be a mixed characteristic complete discrete valuation ring, \mathcal{P} a separated smooth formal scheme over \mathcal{V}, P its special fiber, X a smooth closed subscheme of P, T a divisor in P such that T_X = T \cap X is a divisor in X and \smash{\D}^\dag _{\mathcal{P}}(\hdag T) the weak completion of the sheaf of differential operators on \mathcal{P} with overconvergent singularities along T. We construct a fully faithful functor denoted by  \sp_{X \hookrightarrow \mathcal{P},T,+} from the category of isocrystal on X \setminus T_X overconvergent along T_X into the category of coherent \smash{\D}^\dag _{\mathcal{P}}(\hdag T) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q} -modules with support in X. Next, we prove the commutation of  \sp_{X \hookrightarrow \mathcal{P},T,+} with (extraordinary) inverse images and dual functors. These properties are compatible with Frobenius.
