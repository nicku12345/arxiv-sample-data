In this paper we introduce two versal S_4 coverings, and show that the two are birationaly distinct, i.e. there exists no S_4 equivariant birational map between them. We also introduce two versal A_5 coverings and show that the two are birationaly distinct also. As a corollary we obtain that there are at least three non-conjugate embbedings of S_4 (resp. A_5) into Cr_2(\mathbb{C}), the Cremona group.
