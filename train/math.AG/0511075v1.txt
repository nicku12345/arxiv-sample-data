The work of M. S. Liv\v{s}ic and his collaborators in operator theory associates to a system of commuting nonselfadjoint operators an algebraic curve. Guided by the notion of rational transformation of algebraic curves, we define the notion of a rational transformation of a system of commuting nonselfadjoint operators.
