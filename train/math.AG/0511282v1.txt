Following an approach of Dolgachev, Pinkham and Demazure, we classified in math.AG/0210153 normal affine surfaces with hyperbolic \C^{*}-actions in terms of pairs of \Q-divisors (D_+,D_-) on a smooth affine curve. In the present paper we show how to obtain from this description a natural equivariant completion of these \C^*-surfaces. Using elementary transformations we deduce also natural completions for which the boundary divisor is a standard graph in the sense of math.AG/0511063 and show in certain cases their uniqueness. This description is especially precise in the case of normal affine surfaces completable by a zigzag i.e., by a linear chain of smooth rational curves. As an application we classify all zigzags that appear as boundaries of smooth or normal \C^*-surfaces.
