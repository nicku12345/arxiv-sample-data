We show that the Mathieu groups M_{22} and M_{11} can act on the supersingular K3 surface with Artin invariant 1 in characteristic 11 as symplectic automorphisms. More generally we show that all maximal subgroups of the Mathieu group M_{23} with three orbits on 24 letters act on a supersingular K3 surface with Artin invariant 1 in a suitable characteristic.
