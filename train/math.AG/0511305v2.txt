This paper attempts to provide an analogue of the Novikov conjecture for algebraic (or K\"{a}hler) manifolds. Inter alia, we prove a conjecture of Rosenberg's on the birational invariance of higher Todd genera. We argue that in the algebraic geometric setting the Novikov philosophy naturally includes non-birational mappings.
