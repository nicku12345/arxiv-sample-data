This is the part II of our series of two papers, "Clemens' conjecture: part I", "Clemens' conjecture: part II". Continuing from part I, in this paper we turn our attention to general quintic threefolds. In a universal quintic threefold X, we construct a family of quasi-regular deformation B_b such that the generic member in this family is non-deviated, but some special member is deviated. By the result from part I, this is impossible unless there is no one parameter family of smooth rational curves in a generic quintic threefold.
