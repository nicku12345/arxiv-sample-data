The tropical variety of an ideal was introduced by D.Speyer and B.Sturmfels. In this paper, we will give an analogous definition of local tropical varieties and prove analogous theorems in the formal power series ring. We will also discuss about relations between the local Groebner fan and local tropical variety.
