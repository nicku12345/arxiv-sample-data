The main subject is the difference between the coarse moduli space and the stack of hyperelliptic curves. In particular, we compute their Picard groups, giving explicit description of the generators. We also study how many families of hyperelliptic curves may have the same modular map as well as the existence of the tautological family over the coarse moduli space of hyperelliptic curves.
