We study the functional codes C_2(X) defined on projective varieties X, in the case where X\subset \mathbb{P}^3 is a 1-degenerate quadric or a non-degenerate quadric (hyperbolic or elliptic). We find the minimum distance of these codes, the second weight, and the third weight. We also show the geometrical structure of the first weight and second weight codewords. One result states that the codes C_2(X) defined on the elliptic quadrics are good codes according to the table of A. E. Brouwer.
