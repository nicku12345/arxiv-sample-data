New birational invariants for a projective manifold are defined by using Lawson homology. These invariants can be highly nontrivial even for projective threefolds. Our techniques involve the weak factorization theorem of Wlodarczyk and tools developed by Friedlander, Lawson, Lima-Filho and others. A blowup formula for Lawson homology is given in a separate section. As an application, we show that for each n\geq 5, there is a smooth rational variety X of dimension n such that the Griffiths groups Griff}_p(X) are infinitely generated even modulo torsion for all p with 2\leq p\leq n-3.
