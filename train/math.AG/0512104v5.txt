Let X be a smooth scheme over a field of characteristic 0. Let \dd^{\bullet}(X) be the complex of polydifferential operators on X equipped with Hochschild co-boundary. Let L(\dd^1(X)) be the free Lie algebra generated over \strc by \dd^1(X) concentrated in degree 1 equipped with Hochschild co-boundary. We have a symmetrization map I: \oplus_k \sss^k(L(\dd^1(X))) \rar \dd^{\bullet}(X). Theorem 1 of this paper measures how the map I fails to commute with multiplication.   A consequence of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 is Corollary 1, a result "dual" to Theorem 1 of Markarian [3] that measures how the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg quasi-isomorphism fails to commute with multiplication.   In order to understand Theorem 1 conceptually, we prove a theorem (Theorem 3) stating that \dd^{\bullet}(X) is the universal enveloping algebra of T_X[-1] in \dcat. An easy consequence of Theorem 3 is Theorem 4, which interprets the Chern character E as the "character of the representation E of T_X[-1]" and gives a description of the big Chern classes of E.   Finally, Theorem 4 along with Theorem 1 is used to give an explicit formula (Theorem 5) expressing the big Chern classes of E in terms of the components of the Chern character of E.
