Let M be the moduli space of generalized parabolic bundles (GPBs) of rank r and degree d on a smooth curve X. Let M_{\bar L} be the closure of its subset consisting of GPBs with fixed determinant {\bar L}. We define a moduli functor for which M_{\bar L} is the coarse moduli scheme. Using the correspondence between GPBs on X and torsion-free sheaves on a nodal curve Y of which X is a desingularization, we show that M_{\bar L} can be regarded as the compactified moduli scheme of vector bundles on Y with fixed determinant. We get a natural scheme structure on the closure of the subset consisting of torsion-free sheaves with a fixed determinant in the moduli space of torsion-free sheaves on Y. The relation to Seshadri--Nagaraj conjecture is studied.
