Del Pezzo surfaces over C with log terminal singularities of index \le 2 were classified by Alekseev and Nikulin. In this paper, for each of these surfaces, we find an appropriate morphism to projective space. These morphisms enable us to describe del Pezzo surfaces of index \le 2 by equations in some weighted projective space. Obtained results are natural completions of similar results of Du Val, and Hidaka and Watanabe, describing del Pezzo surfaces of index 1.
