The local Donaldson-Thomas theory of curves is solved by localization and degeneration methods. The results complete a triangle of equivalences relating Gromov-Witten theory, Donaldson-Thomas theory, and the quantum cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of points of the plane.   The quantum differential equation of the Hilbert scheme of points of the plane has a natural interpretation in the local Donaldson-Thomas theory of curves. The solution determines the 1-legged equivariant vertex.
