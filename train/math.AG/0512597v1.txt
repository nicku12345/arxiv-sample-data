Let X be genus 2 curve defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p and let X\_1 be its p-twist. Let M\_X (resp. M\_{X\_1}) be the (coarse) moduli space of semi-stable rank 2 vector bundles with trivial determinant over X (resp. X\_1). The moduli space M\_X is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional projective space and is endowed with an action of the group J[2] of order 2 line bundles over X. When 3\leq p \leq 7, we show that the Verschiebung (i.e., the separable part of the action of Frobenius by pull-back) V : M\_{X\_1} \dashrightarrow M\_X is completely determined by its restrictions to the lines that are invariant under the action of a non zero element of J[2]. Those lines correspond to elliptic curves that appear as Prym varieties and the Verschiebung restricts to the morphism induced by multiplication by p. Therefore, we are able to compute the explicit equations of the Verschiebung when the base field has characteristic 3, 5 or 7.
