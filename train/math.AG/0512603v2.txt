In this paper we study the automorphisms group of some K3 surfaces which are double covers of the projective plane ramified over a smooth sextic plane curve. More precisely, we study the case of a K3 surface of Picard rank two such that there is a rational curve of degree d which is tangent to the sextic in d points.
