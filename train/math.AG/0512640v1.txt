Let G be a split connected semisimple group over a field. We give a conjectural formula for the motive of the stack of G-bundles over a curve C, in terms of special values of the motivic zeta function of C. The formula is true if C=\pp^1 or G=\sln. If k=\cc, upon applying the Poincar\'e or Serre characteristic, the formula reduces to results of Teleman and Atiyah-Bott on the gauge group. If k=\ffq, upon applying the counting measure, it reduces to the fact that the Tamagawa number of G over the function field of C is |\pi_1(G)|.
