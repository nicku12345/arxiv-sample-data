A smooth algebraic surface S is said to be \emph{isogenous to a product of unmixed type} if there exist two smooth curves C, F and a finite group G, acting faithfully on both C and F and freely on their product, so that S=(C \times F)/G. In this paper we classify the surfaces of general type with p_g=q=1 which are isogenous to an unmixed product, assuming that the group G is abelian. It turns out that they belong to four families, that we call surfaces of type I, II, III, IV. The moduli spaces \mathfrak{M}_{I},   \mathfrak{M}_{II}, \mathfrak{M}_{IV} are irreducible, whereas \mathfrak{M}_{III} is the disjoint union of two irreducible components. In the last section we start the analysis of the case where G is not abelian, by constructing several examples.
