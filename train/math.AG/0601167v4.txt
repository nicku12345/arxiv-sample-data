In this paper we derive some new Hodge integral identities by taking limits of the Marino-Vafa formula. These identities include the formula of lambda_{1}lambda_{g}-integral on M_{g,1}, the vanishing result of lambda_{g}ch_{2l}(E)-integral on M_{g,1} for l taking value between 1 and g-3. Finally, we give another simple proof of lambda_{g} conjecture and some examples of low genus integral.
