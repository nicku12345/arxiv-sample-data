Let H be a connected semisimple linear algebraic group defined over \mathbb C and X a compact connected Riemann surface of genus at least three. Let {\mathcal M}'_X(H) be the moduli space parametrising all topologically trivial stable principal H-bundles over X whose automorphism group coincides with the centre of H. It is a Zariski open dense subset of the moduli space of stable principal H-bundles. We prove that there is a universal principal H-bundle over X\times {\mathcal M}'_X(H) if and only if H is an adjoint group (that is, the centre of H is trivial).
