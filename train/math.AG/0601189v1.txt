Let L be a very ample line bundle on a smooth curve C of genus g with \frac{3g+3}{2}<\deg L\le 2g-5. Then L is normally generated if \deg L>\max\{2g+2-4h^1(C,L), 2g-\frac{g-1}{6}-2h^1(C,L)\}. Let C be a triple covering of genus p curve C' with C\stackrel{\phi}\to C' and D a divisor on C' with 4p<\deg D< \frac{g-1}{6}-2p. Then K_C(-\phi^*D) becomes a very ample line bundle which is normally generated. As an application, we characterize some smooth projective surfaces.
