We show that fiberwise stable vector bundles are preserved by relative Fourier-Mukai transforms between elliptic threefolds with relative Picard number one. Using these bundles we define new invariants of elliptic fibrations, and we relate the invariants of a space with those of a relative moduli space of stable sheaves on it. As a byproduct, we calculate the intersection form of a certain new example of an elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold.
