We consider a class of tautological top intersection products on the moduli space of stable pairs consisting of semistable vector bundles together with N sections on a smooth complex projective curve C. We show that when N is large, these intersection numbers can equally be computed on the Grothendieck Quot scheme of coherent sheaf quotients of the rank N trivial sheaf on C. The result has applications to the calculation of the intersection theory of the moduli space of semistable bundles on C.
