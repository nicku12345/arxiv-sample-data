Let C be a smooth curve of genus g\ge 4 and Clifford index c. In this paper, we prove that if C is neither hyperelliptic nor bielliptic with g\ge 2c+5 and \mathcal M computes the Clifford index of C, then either \deg \mathcal M\le \frac{3c}{2}+3 or |\mathcal M|=|g^1_{c+2}+h^1_{c+2}| and g=2c+5. This strengthens the Coppens and Martens' theorem (\cite{CM}, Corollary 3.2.5). Furthermore, for the latter case (1) \mathcal M is half-canonical unless C is a \frac{c+2}{2}-fold covering of an elliptic curve, (2) \mathcal M(F) fails to be normally generated with \cli(\mathcal M(F))=c, h^1(\mathcal M(F))=2 for F\in g^1_{c+2}. Such pairs (C,\mathcal M) can be found on a K3-surface whose Picard group is generated by a hyperplane section in \mathbb P^r. For such a (C, \mathcal M) on a K3-surface, \mathcal M is normally generated while \mathcal M(F) fails to be normally generated with \cli(\mathcal M)=\cli(\mathcal M(F))=c.
