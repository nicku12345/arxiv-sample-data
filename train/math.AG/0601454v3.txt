In this work we obtain presentations of fundamental groups of the complements of three families of quadric arrangements in \mathbb{P}^2. The first arrangement is a union of n quadrics, which are tangent to each other at two common points. The second arrangement is composed of n quadrics which are tangent to each other at one common point. The third arrangement is composed of n quadrics, n-1 of them are tangent to the n'th one and each one of the n-1 quadrics is transversal to the other n-2 ones.
