Let R be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field K. Let X be a flat R-scheme of finite type and G a finite flat group scheme acting on X so that G\_K is faithful on the generic fibre X\_K. We prove that there is an effective model of G i.e. a finite flat group scheme dominated by G, isomorphic to it on the generic fibre, and extending the action of G\_K on X\_K to an action on all of X that is faithful also on the special fibre. It is unique with these properties. We give examples and applications to degenerations of coverings of curves.
