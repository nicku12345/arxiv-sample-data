A result of Beauville states that with a few positive characterstic exceptions, the smooth hyperplane sections of hypersurfaces of degree d>2 in projective space are not all isomorphic. We address the question of whether these sections vary as much as possible. In arbitrary characteristic, we show that this is the case for a general hypersurface.
