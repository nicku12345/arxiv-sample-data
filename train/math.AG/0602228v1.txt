This is a draft of a monograph to appear in the Springer series "Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences", subseries "Invariant Theory and Algebraic Transformation Groups". The subject is homogeneous spaces of algebraic groups and their equivariant embeddings. The style of exposition is intermediate between survey and detailed monograph: some results are supplied with detailed proofs, while the other are cited without proofs but with references to the original papers.   The content is briefly as follows. Starting with basic properties of algebraic homogeneous spaces and related objects, such as induced representations, we focus the attention on homogeneous spaces of reductive groups and introduce two important invariants, called complexity and rank. For the embedding theory it is important that homogeneous spaces of small complexity admit a transparent combinatorial description of their equivariant embeddings. We consider the Luna-Vust theory of equivariant embeddings, paying special attention to the case of complexity not greater than one. A special chapter is devoted to spherical varieties (= embeddings of homogeneous spaces of complexity zero), due to their particular importance and ubiquity. A relation between equivariant embedding theory and equivariant symplectic geometry is also discussed. The book contains several classification results (homogeneous spaces of small complexity, etc).   The text presented here is not in a final form, and the author will be very grateful to any interested reader for his comments and/or remarks, which may be sent to the author by email.
