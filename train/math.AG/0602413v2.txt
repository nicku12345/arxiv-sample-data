Let Mod_{g} be the modular group of surfaces of genus g. Each element [h]\in Mod_{g} induces in the integer homology of a surface of genus g a symplectic automorphism H([h]) and Poincar\'{e} shown that H:Mod_{g}\to Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z}) is an epimorphism. The theory of real algebraic curves justify the definition of real Riemann surface as a Riemann surface S with an anticonformal involution \sigma. Let (S,\sigma) be a real Riemann surface, the subgroup Mod_{g}^{\sigma} of Mod_{g} that consists of the elements [h]\in Mod_{g} that have a representant h such that h\circ\sigma=\sigma\circ h, plays the r\^{o}le of the modular group in the theory of real Riemann surfaces. In this work we describe the image by H of Mod_{g}^{\sigma}. Such image depends on the topological type of the involution \sigma.
