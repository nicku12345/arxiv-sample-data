Let X be a complex manifold. In "Microlocal study of Ind-sheaves I: microsupport and regularity", M. Kashiwara e P. Schapira made the conjecture that a holonomic D-module \shm is regular holonomic if and only if R\mathcal{I}{hom}_{\beta_X\shd_X}(\beta_X\shm,\sho_X^t) is regular (in the sense of "Microlocal study of Ind-sheaves I: microsupport and regularity"), the "only if" part of this conjecture following immediately from "Microlocal study of Ind-sheaves I: microsupport and regularity". Our aim is to prove this conjecture in dimension one.
