We construct rational projective 4-dimensional varieties with the property that certain Lawson homology groups tensored with Q are infinite dimensional Q-vector spaces. More generally, each pair of integers p and k, with k\geq 0, p>0, we find a projective variety Y, such that L_pH_{2p+k}(Y) is infinitely generated. We also construct two singular rational projective 3-dimensional varieties Y and Y' with the same homeomorphism type but different Lawson homology groups, specifically L_1H_3(Y) is not isomorphic to L_1H_3(Y')even up to torsion.
