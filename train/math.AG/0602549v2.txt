L. Makar-Limanov computed the automorphisms groups of surfaces in \mathbb{C}^{3} defined by the equations x^{n}z-P(y)=0, where n\geq1 and P(y) is a nonzero polynomial. Similar results have been obtained by A. Crachiola for surfaces defined by the equations x^{n}z-y^{2}-h(x)y=0, where n\geq2 and h(0)\neq0, defined over an arbitrary base field. Here we consider the more general surfaces defined by the equations x^{n}z-Q(x,y)=0, where n\geq2 and Q(x,y) is a polynomial with coefficients in an arbitrary base field k. Among these surfaces, we characterize the ones which are Danielewski surfaces and we compute their automorphism groups. We study closed embeddings of these surfaces in affine 3-space. We show that in general their automorphisms do not extend to the ambient space. Finally, we give explicit examples of \mathbb{C}^{*}-actions on a surface in \mathbb{C}^{3} which can be extended holomorphically but not algebraically to a \mathbb{C}^{*}-action on \mathbb{C}^{3}.
