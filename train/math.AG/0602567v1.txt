Let X be a minimal projective Gorenstein 3-fold of general type. We give two applications of an inequality between \chi (\omega_X) and p_g(X):   1) Assume that the canonical map \Phi_{|K_X|} is of fiber type. Let F be a smooth model of a generic irreducible component in the general fiber of \Phi_{|K_X|}. Then the birational invariants of F are bounded from above.   2) If X is nonsingular, then c_1^3\leq {1/27} c_1c_2+{10/3} where c_1, c_2 are Chern invariants of X.
