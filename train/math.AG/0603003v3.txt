Let X be a complex analytic manifold, D\subset X a free divisor with jacobian ideal of linear type (e.g. a locally quasi-homogeneous free divisor), j: U=X-D \to X the corresponding open inclusion, E an integrable logarithmic connection with respect to D and L the local system of the horizontal sections of E on U. In this paper we prove that the canonical morphisms between the logarithmic de Rham complex of E(kD) and R j_* L (resp. the logarithmic de Rham complex of E(-kD) and j_!L) are isomorphisms in the derived category of sheaves of complex vector spaces for k\gg 0 (locally on X)
