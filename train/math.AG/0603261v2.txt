In this paper we give a survey about the classification of vector bundles and torsion free sheaves on degenerations of elliptic curves. Coherent sheaves on singular curves of arithmetic genus one can be studied using the technique of matrix problems or via Fourier-Mukai transforms, both methods are discussed here. Moreover, we include new proofs of some classical results about vector bundles on elliptic curves.
