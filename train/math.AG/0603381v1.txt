This is the second part of a work dedicated to the study of Bernstein-Sato polynomials for several analytic functions depending on parameters. In this part, we give constructive results generalizing previous ones obtained by the author in the case of one function. We also make an extensive study of an example for which we give an expression of a generic (and under some conditions, a relative) Bernstein-Sato polynomial.
