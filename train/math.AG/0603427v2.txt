A formula for the irregularity of a cyclic multiple plane associated to a branch curve that has arbitrary singularities and is transverse to the line at infinity is established. The irregularity is expressed as a sum of superabundances of linear systems associated to some multiplier ideals of the branch curve and the proof rests on the theory of standard cyclic coverings. Explicit computations of multiplier ideals are performed and some applications are presented.
