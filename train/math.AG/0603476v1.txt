We construct Abel maps for a stable curve X. Namely, for each one-parameter deformation of X with regular total space, and every integer d>0, we construct by specialization a map \alpha^d_X from the smooth locus of X^d to the moduli scheme of balanced line bundles on semistable curves over X. For d=1, we show that \alpha^1_X naturally extends over X, and does not depend on the choice of the deformation; we give a precise description of when it is injective.
