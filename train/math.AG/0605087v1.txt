Let a finite group G act on the complex plane ({\Bbb C}^2, 0). We consider multi-index filtrations on the spaces of germs of holomorphic functions of two variables equivariant with respect to 1-dimensional representations of the group G defined by components of a modification of the complex plane {\Bbb C}^2 at the origin or by branches of a G-invariant plane curve singularity (C,0)\subset({\Bbb C}^2,0). We give formulae for the Poincare series of these filtrations. In particular, this gives a new method to obtain the Poincare series of analogous filtrations on the rings of germs of functions on quotient surface singularities.
