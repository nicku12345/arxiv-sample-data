In this note we deal with rational curves in P^3 which are images of a line by means of a finite sequence of cubo-cubic Cremona transformations. We prove that these curves can always be obtained applying to the line a sequence of such transformations increasing at each step the degree of the curve. As a corollary we get a result about curves that can give speciality for linear systems of P^3.
