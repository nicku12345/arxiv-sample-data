We study Ruan's \textit{cohomological crepant resolution conjecture} for orbifolds with transversal ADE singularities. In the A_n-case we compute both the Chen-Ruan cohomology ring H^*_{\rm CR}([Y]) and the quantum corrected cohomology ring H^*(Z)(q_1,...,q_n). The former is achieved in general, the later up to some additional, technical assumptions. We construct an explicit isomorphism between H^*_{\rm CR}([Y]) and H^*(Z)(-1) in the A_1-case, verifying Ruan's conjecture. In the A_n-case, the family H^*(Z)(q_1,...,q_n) is not defined for q_1=...=q_n=-1. This implies that the conjecture should be slightly modified. We propose a new conjecture in the A_n-case which we prove in the A_2-case by constructing an explicit isomorphism.
