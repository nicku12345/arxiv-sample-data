We characterize algebras admitting two well agreeing near weights \rho and \sigma. We show that such an algebra R is an integral domain whose quotient field \mathbf K is an algebraic function field of one variable. It contains two places p, Q\in {\mathbb P}(\mathbf K) such that \rho and \sigma are derived from the valuations associated to P and Q. Furthermore \bar R= \cap_{S\in\{\mathbb P}(\mathbf F)\setminus\{P,Q\}}{\mathcal O}_S.
