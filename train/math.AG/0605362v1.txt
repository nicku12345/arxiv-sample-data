Let X be a K3 surface, and H its primitive polarization of the degree H^2=8. The moduli space of sheaves over X with the isotropic Mukai vector (2,H,2) is again a K3 surface, Y. In math.AG/0206158 we gave necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of Picard lattice of X when Y is isomorphic to X. The proof of sufficient condition in math.AG/0206158, when Y is isomorphic to X, used Global Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces, and it was not effective.   Here we give an effective variant of these results: its sufficient part gives an explicit isomorphism between Y and X.   We hope that our similar results in math.AG/0304415, math.AG/0307355, math.AG/0309348 for arbitrary primitive isotropic Mukai vector on a K3 surface also can be made effective.
