Toric varieties associated with root systems appeared very naturally in the theory of group compactifications. Here they are considered in a very different context.   We prove the vanishing of higher cohomology groups for certain line bundles on toric varieties associated to GL_n and G_2. This can be considered of general interest and it improves the previously known results for these varieties. We also show how these results give a simple proof of a converse to Mazur's inequality for GL_n and G_2 respectively. It is known that the latter imply the non-emptiness of some affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties.
