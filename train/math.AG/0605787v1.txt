Given a nonzero germ h of holomorphic function on (C^n,0), we study the condition: ``the ideal Ann\_D 1/h is generated by operators of order 1''. When h defines a generic arrangement of hypersurfaces with an isolated singularity, we show that it is verified if and only if h is weighted homogeneous and -1 is the only integral root of its Bernstein-Sato polynomial. When h is a product, we give a process to test this last condition. Finally, we study some other related conditions.
