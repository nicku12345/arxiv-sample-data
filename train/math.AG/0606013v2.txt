We generalize the construction given in math.AG/0309435 of a "constant" t-structure on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves D(X\times S) starting with a t-structure on D(X). Namely, we remove smoothness and quasiprojectivity assumptions on X and S and work with t-structures that are not necessarily Noetherian but are close to Noetherian in the appropriate sense. The main new tool is the construction of induced t-structures that uses unbounded derived categories of quasicoherent sheaves and relies on the results of \cite{AJS}. As an application of the "constant" t-structures techniques we prove that every bounded nondegenerate t-structure on D(X) with Noetherian heart is invariant under the action of a connected group of autoequivalences of D(X). Also, we show that if X is smooth then the only local t-structures on D(X), i.e., those for which there exist compatible t-structures on D(U) for all open U\subset X, are the perverse t-structures considered in math.AG/0005152.
