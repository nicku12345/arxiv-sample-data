For every smooth (irreducible) cubic surface S we give an explicit construction of a representative for each of the 72 equivalence classes of determinantal representations. Equivalence classes (under \GL_3\times \GL_3 action by left and right multiplication) of determinantal representations are in one to one correspondence with the sets of six mutually skew lines on S and with the 72 (two-dimensional) linear systems of twisted cubic curves on S. Moreover, if a determinantal representation M corresponds to lines (a_1,...,a_6) then its transpose M^t corresponds to lines (b_1,...,b_6) which together form a Schl\"{a}fli's double-six a_1... a_6 \choose b_1... b_6. We also discuss the existence of self-adjoint and definite determinantal representation for smooth real cubic surfaces. The number of these representations depends on the Segre type F_i. We show that a surface of type F_i, i=1,2,3,4 has exactly 2(i-1) nonequivalent self-adjoint determinantal representations none of which is definite, while a surface of type F_5 has 24 nonequivalent self-adjoint determinantal representations, 16 of which are definite.
