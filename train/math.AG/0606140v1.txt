We present relations between cycles with rational coefficients modulo algebraic equivalence on the Jacobian of a curve. These relations depend on the linear systems the curve admits. They are obtained in the tautological ring, the smallest subspace containing (an embedding of) the curve and closed under the basic operations of intersection, Pontryagin product and the pullback and pushdown induced by homotheties.
