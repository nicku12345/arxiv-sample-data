Let X be a K3 surface, and H its primitive polarization of the degree H^2=2rs, r,s\ge 1. The moduli space of sheaves over X with the isotropic Mukai vector (r,H,s) is again a K3 surface, Y. In math.AG/0206158, math.AG/0304415 and math.AG/0307355 (in general) we gave necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of Picard lattice N(X) of X when Y is isomorphic to X, under the additional condition H\cdot N(X)=\bz.   Here we show that these conditions imply existence of an isomorphism between Y and X which is a composition of some universal isomorphisms between moduli of sheaves over X, and Tyurin's isomorphsim between moduli of sheaves over X and X itself. It follows that for a general K3 surface X with H\cdot N(X)=\bz and Y\cong X, there exists an isomorphism Y\cong X which is a composition of the universal and the Tyurin's isomorphisms.   This generalizes our recent results math.AG/0605362 for r=s=2 on similar subject.
