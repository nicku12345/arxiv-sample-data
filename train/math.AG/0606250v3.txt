We consider categories of rational maps to algebraic groups and study existence and construction of universal objects for such categories, using the duality theory of Laumon 1-motives. In particular, we obtain functorial descriptions of the Albanese of a singular projective variety X over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, which is the universal regular quotient of a relative Chow group of points on X, and of its dual.
