We prove a formula for the orbifold Chow ring of semi-projective toric DM stacks, generalizing the orbifold Chow ring formula of projective toric DM stacks by Borisov-Chen-Smith. We also consider a special kind of semi-projective toric DM stacks, the Lawrence toric DM stacks. We prove that the orbifold Chow ring of a Lawrence toric DM stack is isomorphic to the orbifold Chow ring of its associated hypertoric DM stack studied in \cite{JT}.
