We show how to translate the task of computing the multiplicative structure of a Chow ring of a projective homogeneous variety into an easily understandable combinatorial task of calculating in the corresponding polynomial ring. The algorithms are also presented as a Maple package. Then we proceed to compute the multiplicative structure of the Chow rings for projective homogeneous varieties E6/P1, E7/P7, and E8/P8.
