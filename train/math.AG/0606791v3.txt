In most cases where it had been shown to exist the derived McKay correspondence D(Y) --> D^G(C^n) can be written as a Fourier-Mukai transform which sends point sheaves of the crepant resolution Y to pure sheaves in D^G(C^n). We give a sufficient condition for an object of D^G(Y x C^n) to be the defining object of such a transform. We use it to construct the first example of the derived McKay correspondence for a non-projective crepant resolution of C^3/G. Along the way we extract some more geometric sense out of the Intersection Theorem and learn to explicitly compute theta-stable families of G-constellations and their direct transforms.
