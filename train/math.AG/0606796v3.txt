The paper is motivated on the open problem of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. The aim is to present a form of induction which is different from that used by Hironaka. In characteristic zero induction is formulated by restriction to smooth hypersurfaces (hypersurfaces of maximal contact). Our alternative approach, introduced here, replaces restrictions to smooth sub-schemes by generic projections on smooth schemes of smaller dimension. We also introduce a generalization of the discriminant, and our result makes use of the elimination theory. In the case of fields of characteristic zero, elimination gives exactly the same information as the form of induction used by Hironaka.
