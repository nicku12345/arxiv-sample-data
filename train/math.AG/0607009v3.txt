This paper represents the main portion of the Ph.D. Thesis of the author, and is the first of the series of four papers, which is a joint work with K. Matsuki as a whole. We present a program toward constructing an algorithm for resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. We would like to emphasize, however, that the program is actually valid in all characteristics. As such, it leads in characteristic zero to a complete algorithm, which is slightly different from the existing ones. In positive characteristic, almost all the ingredients work nicely forming a perfect parallel to the case in characteristic zero, except for the problem of termination, which remains as the only missing piece toward the completion of our algorithm.
