Under a hypothesis on k, d and n that is almost the best possible, we prove that for every smooth degree d hypersurface in P^n, the k-plane sections dominate the moduli space of degree d hypersurface in P^k.   Using this we prove rational simple connectedness of every smooth degree d hypersurface in P^n, under a suitable hypothesis on d and n (previous results were only for general hypersurfaces).
