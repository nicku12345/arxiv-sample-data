In this paper, we initiate our investigation of log canonical models for the moduli space of curves with the boundary divisor \a \d as we decrease \a from 1 to 0. We prove that for the first critical value \a = 9/11, the log canonical model is isomorphic to the moduli space of pseudostable curves, which have nodes and cusps as singularities. We also show that \a = 7/10 is the next critical value, i.e., the log canonical model stays the same in the interval (7/10, 9/11]. In the appendix, we develop a theory of log canonical models of stacks that explains how these can be expressed in terms of the coarse moduli space.
