We study the quantum cohomology of (co)minuscule homogeneous varieties under a unified perspective. We show that three points Gromov-Witten invariants can always be interpreted as classical intersection numbers on auxiliary varieties. Our main combinatorial tools are certain quivers, in terms of which we obtain a quantum Chevalley formula and a higher quantum Poincar\'{e} duality. In particular we compute the quantum cohomology of the two exceptional minuscule homogeneous varieties.
