Let X\to\P^n be an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold of dimension 2n fibred over \P^n. Matsushita proved that the generic fibre is a holomorphic Lagrangian abelian variety. In this article we study the discriminant locus \Delta\subset\P^n parametrizing singular fibres. Our main result is a formula for the degree of \Delta, leading to bounds on the degree when X is a four-fold.
