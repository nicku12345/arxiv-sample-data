We extend B. Hassett's theory of weighted stable pointed curves ([Has03]) to weighted stable maps. The space of stability conditions is described explicitly, and the wall-crossing phenomenon studied. This can be considered as a non-linear analog of the theory of stability conditions in abelian and triangulated categories.   We introduce virtual fundamental classes and thus obtain weighted Gromov-Witten invariants. We show that by including gravitational descendants, one obtains an \LL-algebra as introduced in [LM04] as a generalization of a cohomological field theory.
