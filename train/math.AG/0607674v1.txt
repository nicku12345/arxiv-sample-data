The notion of microsupport and regularity for ind-sheaves was introduced by M. Kashiwara and P. Schapira in "Microlocal study of ind-sheaves I: microsupport and regularity". In this paper we study the behaviour of the microsupport under several functorial operations and characterize "microlocally" the ind-sheaves that are regular along involutive manifolds. As an application we prove that if a coherent D-module M is regular along an involutive manifold V (in the sense of "Systems of differential equations with regular singularities and their boundary value problems") then the ind-sheaf of temperate holomorphic solutions of M is regular along V. Another application is the notion of microsupport for sheaves on the subanalytic site, which can be given directly, without using the more complicated language of ind-sheaves.
