Denoting by {\mathcal L}_d(m_0,m_1,...,m_r) the linear system of plane curves passing through r+1 generic points p_0,p_1,...,p_r of the projective plane with multiplicity m_i (or larger) at each p_i, we prove the Harbourne-Hirschowitz Conjecture for linear systems {\mathcal L}_d(m_0,m_1,...,m_r) determined by a wide family of systems of multiplicities \bold{m}=(m_i)_{i=0}^r and arbitrary degree d. Moreover, we provide an algorithm for computing a bound of the regularity of an arbitrary system \bold{m} and we give its exact value when \bold{m} is in the above family. To do that, we prove an H^1-vanishing theorem for line bundles on surfaces associated with some pencils ``at infinity''.
