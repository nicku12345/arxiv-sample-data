The Minimal Model Program offers natural higher-dimensional analogues of stable n-pointed curves and maps: stable pairs consisting of a projective variety X of dimension \ge2 and a divisor B, that should satisfy a few simple conditions, and stable maps f:(X,B)\to Y. Although MMP remains conjectural in higher dimensions, in several important situations the moduli spaces of stable pairs, generalizing those of Deligne-Mumford, Knudsen and Kontsevich, can be constructed more directly, and in considerable generality. We review these constructions, with particular attention paid to varieties with group action, and list some open problems.
