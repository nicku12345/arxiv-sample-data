We study the intersection theory on the moduli spaces of maps of n-pointed curves f:(C,s_1,... s_n)\to V which are stable with respect to a weight data (a_1,..., a_n), 0\le a_i\le 1. After describing the structure of these moduli spaces, we prove a formula describing the way each descendant changes under a wall crossing. As a corollary, we compute the weighted descendants in terms of the usual ones, i.e. for the weight data (1,...,1), and vice versa.
