To construct a resulting model in LMMP is sufficient to prove existence of log flips and their termination for certain sequences. We prove that LMMP in dimension d-1 and termination of terminal log flips in dimension d imply, for any log pair of dimension d, the existence of a {\em resulting} log model: a strictly log minimal model or a strictly log terminal Mori log fibration, and imply existence of log flips in dimension d+1. As consequence, we prove existence of a resulting model of 4-fold log pairs, existence of log flips in dimension 5, and some fragments of Geography of log models in dimension 4.
