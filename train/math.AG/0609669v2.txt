Given a complete nonsingular algebraic variety X and a divisor D with normal crossings, we say that X is log homogeneous with boundary D if the logarithmic tangent bundle T_X(- \log D) is generated by its global sections. We then show that the Albanese morphism \alpha is a fibration with fibers being spherical (in particular, rational) varieties. It follows that all irreducible components of D are nonsingular, and any partial intersection of them is irreducible. Also, the image of X under the morphism \sigma associated with - K_X - D is a spherical variety, and the irreducible components of all fibers of \sigma are quasiabelian varieties. Generalizing the Borel-Remmert structure theorem for homogeneous varieties, we show that the product morphism \alpha \times \sigma is surjective, and the irreducible components of its fibers are toric varieties. We reduce the classification of log homogeneous varieties to a problem concerning automorphism groups of spherical varieties, that we solve under an additional assumption.
