We shall prove that the Poisson deformation functor of an affine (singular) symplectic variety is unobstructed. As a corollary, we prove the following result.   Theorem: For an affine symplectic variety X with a good C^*-action (where its natural Poisson structure is positively weighted), the following are equivalent   (1) X has a crepant projective resolution. (2) X has a smoothing by a Poisson deformation.
