For orbifolds admitting a crepant resolution and satisfying a hard Lefschetz condition, we formulate a conjectural equivalence between the Gromov-Witten theories of the orbifold and the resolution. We prove the conjecture for the equivariant Gromov-Witten theories of the nth symmetric product of the complex plane and the Hilbert scheme of n points in the plane.
