We propose an approach via Frobenius manifolds to the study (began in math.AG/0407254) of the relation between rational Gromov-Witten invariants of nonabelian quotients X//G and those of the corresponding ``abelianized'' quotients X//T, for T a maximal torus in G. The ensuing conjecture expresses the Gromov-Witten potential of X//G in terms of the potential of X//T. We prove this conjecture when the nonabelian quotients are partial flag manifolds.
