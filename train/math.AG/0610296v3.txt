If \Adot is a bounded, constructible complex of sheaves on a complex analytic space X, and f:X\to\C and g:X\to\C are complex analytic functions, then the iterated vanishing cycles \phi_g[-1](\phi_f[-1]\Adot) are important for a number of reasons. We give a formula for the stalk cohomology H^*(\phi_g[-1]\phi_f[-1]\Adot)_x in terms of relative polar curves, algebra, and the normal Morse data and micro-support of \Adot.
