We study Nahm transformation for parabolic Higgs bundles on the projective line \PP^1, with logarithmic singularities on a finite set P. Such a Higgs bundle can be given by its spectral data: a Hirzebruch surface Z together with a coherent sheaf M on Z, supported in dimension 1 and away from infinity. We describe the transform in terms of these data. The main technical tool is the notion of proper transform of a coherent sheaf with respect to a blow-up. Finally, we prove the main properties of the induced map on moduli spaces: involutibility and preservation of the hyper-Kaehler structure.
