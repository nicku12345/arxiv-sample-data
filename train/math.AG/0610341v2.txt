Let X be a non-singular projective threefold over an algebraically closed field of any characteristic, and let A^2(X) be the group of algebraically trivial codimension 2 algebraic cycles on X modulo rational equivalence with coefficients in \mathbb Q. Assume X is birationally equivalent to another threefold X' admitting a fibration over an integral curve C whose generic fiber X'_{\bar \eta}, where \bar \eta =Spec(\bar {k(C)}), satisfies the following three conditions: (i) the motive M(X'_{\bar \eta}) is finite-dimensional, (ii) H^1_{et}(X_{\bar \eta},\mathbb Q_l)=0 and (iii) H^2_{et}(X_{\bar \eta},\mathbb Q_l(1)) is spanned by divisors on X_{\bar \eta}. We prove that, provided these three assumptions, the group A^2(X) is representable in the weak sense: there exists a curve Y and a correspondence z on Y\times X, such that z induces an epimorphism A^1(Y)\to A^2(X), where A^1(Y) is isomorphic to Pic^0(Y) tensored with \mathbb Q. In particular, the result holds for threefolds birational to three-dimensional Del Pezzo fibrations over a curve.
