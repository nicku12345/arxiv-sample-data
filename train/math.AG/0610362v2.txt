Let f,g:\cc^2\ra\cc be two quasi-homogeneous polynomials. We compute the V-filtration of the restriction of f to any plane curve C_t=g^{-1}(t) and show that the Gorenstein generator dx\wedge dy/dg is a primitive form. Using results of A. Douai and C. Sabbah, we conclude that base space of the miniversal unfolding of f_t:=f|_{C_t} is a Frobenius manifold. At the singular fibre C_0 we obtain a non-massive Frobenius manifold.
