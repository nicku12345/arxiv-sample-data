We prove a formula for the geometric genus of splice-quotient singularities (in the sense of Neumann and Wahl). This formula enables us to compute the invariant from the resolution graph; in fact, it reduces the computation to that for splice-quotient singularities with smaller resolution graphs. We also discuss the dimension of the first cohomology groups of certain invertible sheaves on a resolution of a splice-quotient singularity.
