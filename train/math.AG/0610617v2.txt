We compare the Chen-Ruan cohomology ring of the weighted projective spaces \IP(1,3,4,4) and \IP(1,...,1,n) with the cohomology ring of their crepant resolutions. In both cases, we prove that the Chen-Ruan cohomology ring is isomorphic to the quantum corrected cohomology ring of the crepant resolution after suitable evaluation of the quantum parameters. For this, we prove a formula for the Gromov-Witten invariants of the resolution of a transversal {\rm A}_3 singularity.
