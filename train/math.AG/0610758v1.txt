In an earlier paper we conjectured a relation between the quantum \mathcal D-modules of a smooth variety X and the projectivisation of a direct sum of line bundles over it. In this paper we prove the conjecture when X is a complete intersection in a toric variety. We also use the conjecture to show that the relations of the small quantum cohomology ring of X that come from differential operators lift to the projective bundle. The basic cohomology relation of the projective bundle deforms to a relation in the small quantum cohomology.
