We give an introduction to a theory of b-functions, i.e. Bernstein-Sato polynomials. After reviewing some facts from D-modules, we introduce b-functions including the one for arbitrary ideals of the structure sheaf. We explain the relation with singularities, multiplier ideals, etc., and calculate the b-functions of monomial ideals and also of hyperplane arrangements in certain cases.
