We give an introduction to Tropical Geometry and prove some results in Tropical Intersection Theory. The first part of this paper is an introduction to tropical geometry aimed at researchers in Algebraic Geometry from the point of view of degenerations of varieties using projective not-necessarily-normal toric varieties. The second part is a foundational account of tropical intersection theory with proofs of some new theorems relating it to classical intersection theory.   Revised version includes many corrections, more examples, and improved exposition.
