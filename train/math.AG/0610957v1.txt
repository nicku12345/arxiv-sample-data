We show that homologically projectively dual varieties for Grassmannians Gr(2,6) and Gr(2,7) are given by certain noncommutative resolutions of singularities of the corresponding Pfaffian varieties. As an application we describe the derived categories of linear sections of these Grassmannians and Pfaffians. In particular, we show that   (1) the derived category of a Pfaffian cubic 4-fold admits a semiorthogonal decompositions consisting of 3 exceptional line bundles, and of the derived category of a K3-surface;   (2) mutually orthogonal Calabi-Yau linear sections of Gr(2,7) and of the corresponding Pfaffian variety are derived equivalent.   We also conjecture a rationality criterion for cubic 4-folds in terms of their derived categories.
