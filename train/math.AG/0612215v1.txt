The Calabi-Yau differential equations of degree 2 and 3 are listed. The idea is to bring some order into the "big table" into the "big table" (math. AG/0507430). The author has benefitted from an unpublished result by Yifan Yang, which reduces the degree of many equations. Also difference equations (giving rise to Calabi-Yau differential equations) of order 2 and 3 are studied.
