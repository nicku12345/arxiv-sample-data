Let (X,D) be a D-scheme in the sense of Beilinson and Bernstein, given by an algebraic variety X and a morphism O_X -> D of sheaves of rings on X. We consider noncommutative deformations of quasi-coherent sheaves of left D-modules on X, and show how to compute their pro-representing hulls. As an application, we compute the noncommutative deformations of the left D_X-module O_X when X is any elliptic curve.
