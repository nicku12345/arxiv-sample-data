We discuss the theory of generalized Weierstrass \sigma and \wp functions defined on a trigonal curve of genus four, following earlier work on the genus three case. The specific example of the "purely trigonal" (or "cyclic trigonal") curve y^3=x^5+\lambda_4 x^4 +\lambda_3 x^3+\lambda_2 x^2 +\lambda_1 x+\lambda_0 is discussed in detail, including a list of some of the associated partial differential equations satisfied by the \wp functions, and the derivation of an addition formulae.
