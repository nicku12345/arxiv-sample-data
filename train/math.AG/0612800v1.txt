In this paper we prove first a general theorem on semiorthogonal decompositions in derived categories of coherent sheaves for flat families over a smooth base. Based on the results of math.AG/0510670, we then show that the derived categories of coherent sheaves on flag varieties of classical type are generated by complete exceptional collections. Finally, we find complete exceptional collections in the derived categories of some homogeneous spaces of the symplectic groups of small rank.
