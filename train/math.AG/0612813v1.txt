We study the Saito-Ikeda infinitesimal invariant of the ccle defined by curves in their jacobians using rank (k+1) vector bundles and we give a criterion for which the higher cycle class map is not trivial. When k=2, this turns out to be strictly linked to the Petri map for vector bundles: an explicit construction on a curve of genus g>9 shows the existence of a non trivial element in the higher Griffiths group.
