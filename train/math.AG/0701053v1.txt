We prove a local duality for some schemes associated to a 2-dimensional complete local ring whose residue field is an n-dimensional local field in the sense of Kato-Parshin. Our results generalize the Saito works in the case n=0 and are applied to study the Bloch-Ogus complex for such rings in various cases.
