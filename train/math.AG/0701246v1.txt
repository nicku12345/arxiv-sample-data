Itenberg and Shustin's pseudoholomorphic curve patchworking is in principle more flexible than Viro's original algebraic one. It was natural to wonder if the former method allows one to construct non-algebraic objects. In this paper we construct the first examples of patchworked real pseudoholomorphic curves in \Sigma_n whose position with respect to the pencil of lines cannot be realised by any homologous real algebraic curve.
