Let X be a complex submanifold of dimension d of \mathbb P^m\times\mathbb P^n (m\geq n\geq 2) and denote by \alpha\colon\Pic(\mathbb P^m\times\mathbb P^n)\to \Pic(X) the restriction map of Picard groups, by N_{X|\mathbb P^m\times\mathbb P^n} the normal bundle of X in \mathbb P^m\times\mathbb P^n. Set t:=\max\{\dim\pi_1(X),\dim\pi_2(X)\}, where \pi_1 and \pi_2 are the two projections of \mathbb P^m\times\mathbb P^n. We prove a Barth-Lefschetz type result as follows: {\em Theorem.} {\it If d\geq \frac{m+n+t+1}{2} then X is algebraically simply connected, the map \alpha is injective and \Coker(\alpha) is torsion-free. Moreover \alpha is an isomorphism if d\geq\frac{m+n+t+2}{2}, or if d=\frac{m+n+t+1}{2} and N_{X|\mathbb P^m\times\mathbb P^n} is decomposable.} These bounds are optimal. The main technical ingredients in the proof are: the Kodaira-Le Potier vanishing theorem in the generalized form of Sommese (\cite{LP}, \cite{ShS}), the join construction and an algebraisation result of Faltings concerning small codimensional subvarieties in \mathbb P^N (see \cite{Fa}).
