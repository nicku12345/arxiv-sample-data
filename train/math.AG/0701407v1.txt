Let \Cal C,\Cal C' be curves over a base scheme S with g(\Cal C)\ge 2. Then the functor T\mapsto\{generically smooth T-morphisms T\times_S\Cal C'\to T\times_S\Cal C\} from ((S-schemes)) to ((sets)) is represented by a quasi-finite unramified S-scheme. From this one can deduce that for any two integers g\ge 2 and g', there is an integer M(g,g') such that for any two curves C,C' over any field k with g(C)=g, g(C')=g', there are at most M(g,g') separable k-morphisms C'\to C. It is conjectured that the arithmetic function M(g,g') is bounded by a linear function of g'.
