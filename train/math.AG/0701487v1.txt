Let X be a submanifold of dimension d\geq 2 of the complex projective space \mathbb P^n. We prove results of the following type. i) If X is irregular and n=2d then the normal bundle N_{X|\mathbb P^n} is indecomposable. ii) If X is irregular, d\geq 3 and n=2d+1 then N_{X|\mathbb P^n} is not the direct sum of two vector bundles of rank \geq 2. iii) If d\geq 3, n=2d-1 and N_{X|\mathbb P^n} is decomposable then the natural restriction map \Pic(\mathbb P^n)\to\Pic(X) is an isomorphism (and in particular, if X=\mathbb P^{d-1}\times\mathbb P^1 embedded Segre in \mathbb P^{2d-1} then N_{X|\mathbb P^{2d-1}} is indecomposable). iv) Let n\leq 2d and d\geq 3, and assume that N_{X|\mathbb P^n} is a direct sum of line bundles; if n=2d assume furthermore that X is simply connected and \mathscr O_X(1) is not divisible in \Pic(X). Then X is a complete intersection. These results follow from Theorem \ref{exact5} below together with Le Potier vanishing theorem. The last statement also uses a criterion of Faltings for complete intersection. In the case when n<2d this fact was proved by M. Schneider in 1990 in a completely different way.
