We give some examples of Calabi-Yau 3-folds with \rho=1, defined over \mathbb{Q} and constructed as 4-codimensional subvarieties of \mathbb{P}^7 via commutative algebra methods. We explain how to deduce their Hodge diamond and top Chern classes from computer based computations over some finite field \mathbb{F}_{p}. Three of our examples are new. These examples are built out of Gulliksen-Neg\r{a}rd and Kustin-Miller complexes of locally free sheaves. Finally, we give two new examples of Calabi-Yau 3-folds of \mathbb{P}^6 of degree 14 and 15 that are not deformation-equivalent to the previously known examples of these degrees in \mathbb{P}^6 (even though they share the same invariants (H^3, c_2\cdot H, c_3) and \rho=1).
