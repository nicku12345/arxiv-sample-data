We prove birational rigidity and calculate the group of birational automorphisms of a nodal Q-factorial double cover X of a smooth three-dimensional quadric branched over a quartic section. We also prove that X is Q-factorial provided that it has at most 11 singularities; moreover, we give an example of a non-Q-factorial variety of this type with 12 simple double singularities.
