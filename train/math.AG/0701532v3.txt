We give an informal introduction to formal and rigid geometry over complete discrete valuation rings, and we discuss some applications in algebraic and arithmetic geometry and singularity theory, with special emphasis on recent applications to the Milnor fibration and the motivic zeta function by J. Sebag and the author.
