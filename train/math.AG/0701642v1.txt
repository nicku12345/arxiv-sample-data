Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus g\geq 2 over the complex numbers. A holomorphic triple (E_1,E_2,\phi) on X consists of two holomorphic vector bundles E_{1} and E_{2} over X and a holomorphic map \phi \colon E_{2} \to E_{1}.   There is a concept of stability for triples which depends on a real parameter \sigma.   In this paper, we determine the Hodge polynomials of the moduli spaces of \sigma-stable triples with \mathrm{rk}(E_1)=\mathrm{rk}(E_2)=2, using the theory of mixed Hodge structures (in the cases that they are smooth and compact).   This gives in particular the Poincar{\'e} polynomials of these moduli spaces.   As a byproduct, we also give the Hodge polynomial of the moduli space of even degree rank 2 stable vector bundles.
