Let C be a general connected, smooth, projective curve of positive genus g. For each nonnegative integer i we give formulas for the number of pairs (P,Q) em C x C off the diagonal such that (g+i-1)Q-(i+1)P is linearly equivalent to an effective divisor, and the number of pairs (P,Q) em C x C off the diagonal such that (g+i+1)Q-(i+1)P is linearly equivalent to a moving effective divisor.
