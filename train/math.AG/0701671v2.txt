We partially prove and partially disprove Oka's conjecture on the fundamental group/Alexander polynomial of an irreducible plane sextic. Among other results, we enumerate all irreducible sextics with simple singularities admitting dihedral coverings and find examples of Alexander equivalent Zariski pairs of irreducible sextics.
