We construct a family of examples of Legendrian subvarieties in some projective spaces. Although most of them are singular, a new example of smooth Legendrian variety in dimension 8 is in this family. The 8-fold has interesting properties: it is a compactification of the special linear group, a Fano manifold of index 5 and Picard number 1.
