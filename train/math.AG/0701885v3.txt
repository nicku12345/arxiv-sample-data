We study a particular class of rationally connected manifolds, X\subset \p^N, such that two general points x,x' \in X may be joined by a conic contained in X. We prove that these manifolds are Fano, with b_2\leq 2. Moreover, a precise classification is obtained for b_2=2. Complete intersections of high dimension with respect to their multi-degree provide examples for the case b_2=1. The proof of the classification result uses a general characterization of rationality, in terms of suitable covering families of rational curves.
