Quadratic entry locus manifold of type \delta X\subset\mathbb P^N of dimension n\geq 1 are smooth projective varieties such that the locus described on X by the points spanning secant lines passing through a general point of the secant variety SX\subseteq\mathbb P^N is a smooth quadric hypersurface of dimension \delta=2n+1-\dim(SX) equal to the secant defect of X.   These manifolds appear widely and naturally among projective varieties having special geometric properties and/or extremal tangential behaviour. We prove that, letting \delta=2r_X +1\geq 3 or \delta=2r_X+2, then 2^{r_X} divides n-\delta. This is obtained by the study of the projective geometry of the Hilbert scheme Y_x\subset \mathbb(T_x^*) of lines passing through a general point x of X, allowing an inductive procedure.   The Divisibility Property described above allows unitary and simple proofs of many results on QEL-manifolds such as the complete classification of those of type \delta\geq n/2, of Cremona transformation of type (2,3), (2,5). In particular we propose a new and very short proof of the fact that Severi varieties have dimension 2,4, 8 or 16 and also an almost self contained half page proof of their classification due to Zak.
