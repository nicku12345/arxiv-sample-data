Let \pi: Z \ra X be a Galois covering of smooth projective curves with Galois group the Weyl group of a simple and simply-connected Lie group G. For any dominant weight \lambda consider the curve Y = Z/\Stab(\lambda). The Kanev correspondence defines an abelian subvariety P_\lambda of the Jacobian of Y. We compute the type of the polarization of the restriction of the canonical principal polarization of \Jac(Y) to P_\lambda in some cases. In particular, in the case of the group E_8 we obtain families of Prym-Tyurin varieties. The main idea is the use of an abelianization map of the Donagi-Prym variety to the moduli stack of principal G-bundles on the curve X.
