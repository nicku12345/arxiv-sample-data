Let {\cal L} be a variation of Hodge structures on the complement X^{*} of a normal crossing divisor (NCD)  Y in a smooth analytic variety X and let  j: X^{*} = X - Y \to X  denotes the open embedding. The purpose of this paper is to describe the weight filtration W on a combinatorial logarithmic complex computing the (higher) direct image {\bf j}_{*}{\cal L} , underlying a mixed Hodge complex when X is proper, proving in this way the results in the note [14] generalizing the constant coefficients case. When a morphism f: X \to D to a complex disc is given with Y = f^{-1}(0), the weight filtration on the complex of nearby cocycles \Psi_f ({\cal L}) on Y can be described by these logarithmic techniques and a comparison theorem shows that the filtration coincides with the weight defined by the logarithm of the monodromy which provides the link with various results on the subject.
