We define defect for hypersurfaces with A-D-E singularities in complex projective normal Cohen-Macaulay fourfolds having some vanishing properties of Bott-type and prove formulae for Hodge numbers of big resolutions of such hypersurfaces. We compute Hodge numbers of Calabi-Yau manifolds obtained as small resolutions of cuspidal triple sextics and double octics with higher A_j singularities.
