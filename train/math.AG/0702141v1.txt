We consider heights of horizontal irreducible divisors on an arithmetic surface with respect to some hermitian line bundle. We obtain both lower and upper bounds for these heights. The results are different and sometimes stronger that those of S.Zhang on the same question. The case of the relative dualizing sheaf with the Arakelov metric is made especially explicit.
