Let Y be a smooth curve embedded in a complex projective manifold X of dimension n\geq 2 with ample normal bundle N_{Y|X}. For every p\geq 0 let \alpha_p denote the natural restriction maps \Pic(X)\to\Pic(Y(p)), where Y(p) is the p-th infinitesimal neighbourhood of Y in X. First one proves that for every p\geq 1 there is an isomorphism of abelian groups \Coker(\gra_p)\cong\Coker(\gra_0)\oplus K_p(Y,X), where K_p(Y,X) is a quotient of the \mathbb C-vector space L_p(Y,X):=\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^p H^1(Y, {\bf S}^i(N_{Y|X})^*) by a free subgroup of L_p(Y,X) of rank strictly less than the Picard number of X. Then one shows that L_1(Y,X)=0 if and only if Y\cong\mathbb P^1 and N_{Y|X}\cong\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1}(1)^{\oplus n-1}. The special curves in question are by definition those for which \dim_{\mathbb C}L_1(Y,X)=1. This equality is closely related with a beautiful classical result of B. Segre. It turns out that Y is special if and only if either Y\cong\mathbb P^1 and N_{Y|X}\cong\sO_{\pn 1}(2)\oplus\sO_{\pn 1}(1)^{\oplus n-2}, or Y is elliptic and \deg(N_{Y|X})=1. After proving some general results on manifolds of dimension n\geq 2 carrying special rational curves (e.g. they form a subclass of the class of rationally connected manifolds which is stable under small projective deformations), a complete birational classification of pairs (X,Y) with X surface and Y special is given. Finally, one gives several examples of special rational curves in dimension n\geq 3.
