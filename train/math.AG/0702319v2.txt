We will generalize the projective model structure in the category of unbounded complexes of modules over a commutative ring to the category of unbounded complexes of quasi-coherent sheaves over the projective line. Concretely we will define a locally projective model structure in the category of complexes of quasi-coherent sheaves on the projective line. In this model structure the cofibrant objects are the dg-locally projective complexes. We also describe the fibrations of this model structure and show that the model structure is monoidal. We point out that this model structure is necessarily different from other known model structures such as the injective model structure and the locally free model structure.
