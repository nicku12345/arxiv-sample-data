Let C be a genus 2 curve and \su the moduli space of semi-stable rank 2 vector bundles on C with trivial determinant. In \cite{bol:wed} we described the parameter space of non stable extension classes (invariant with respect to the hyperelliptic involution) of the canonical sheaf \omega of C with \omega_C^{-1}. In this paper we study the classifying rational map \phi: \pr Ext^1(\omega,\omega^{-1})\cong \pr^4 \dashrightarrow \su\cong \pr^3 that sends an extension class on the corresponding rank two vector bundle. Moreover we prove that, if we blow up \pr^4 along a certain cubic surface S and \su at the point p corresponding to the bundle \OO \oplus \OO, then the induced morphism \tilde{\phi}: Bl_S \ra Bl_p\su defines a conic bundle that degenerates on the blow up (at p) of the Kummer surface naturally contained in \su. Furthermore we construct the \pr^2-bundle that contains the conic bundle and we discuss the stability and deformations of one of its components.
