Let X be any compact connected Riemann surface of genus g \geq 3. For any r\geq 2, let M_X denote the moduli space of holomorphic SL(r,C)-connections over X. It is known that the biholomorphism class of the complex variety M_X is independent of the complex structure of X. If g=3, then we assume that r\geq 3. We prove that the isomorphism class of the variety M_X determines the Riemann surface X uniquely up to isomorphism. A similar result is proved for the moduli space of holomorphic GL(r,C)-connections on X.   We also show that the Torelli theorem remains valid for the moduli spaces of connections, as well as those of stable vector bundles, on geometrically irreducible smooth projective curves defined over the field of real numbers.
