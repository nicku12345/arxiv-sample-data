Let C be a curve of genus two. We denote by SU_C(3) the moduli space of semi-stable vector bundles of rank 3 and trivial determinant over C, and by J^d the variety of line bundles of degree d on C. In particular, J^1 has a canonical theta divisor \Theta. The space SU_C(3) is a double cover of P^8=|3\Theta| branched along a sextic hypersurface, the Coble sextic. In the dual \check{P}^8=|3\Theta|^*, where J^1 is embedded, there is a unique cubic hypersurface singular along J^1, the Coble cubic. We prove that these two hypersurfaces are dual, inducing a non-abelian Torelli result. Moreover, by looking at some special linear sections of these hypersurfaces, we can observe and reinterpret some classical results of algebraic geometry in a context of vector bundles: the duality of the Segre-Igusa quartic with the Segre cubic, the symmetric configuration of 15 lines and 15 points, the Weddle quartic surface and the Kummer surface.
