Embedded principalization of ideals in smooth schemes, also known as Log-resolutions of ideals, play a central role in algebraic geometry. If two sheaves of ideals, say I_1 and I_2, over a smooth scheme V have the same integral closure, it is well known that Log-resolution of one of them induces a Log-resolution of the other. On the other hand, in case V is smooth over a field of characteristic zero, an algorithm of desingularization provides, for each sheaf of ideals, a unique Log-resolution.   In this paper we show that algorithms of desingularization define the same Log-resolution for two ideals having the same integral closure. We prove this result here by using the form of induction introduced by W{\l}odarczyk.   We extend the notion of Log-resolution of ideals over a smooth scheme V, to that of Rees algebras over V; and then we show that two Rees algebras with the same integral closure undergo the same constructive resolution. The key point is the interplay of integral closure with differential operators.
