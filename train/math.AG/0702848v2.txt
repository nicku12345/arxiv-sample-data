This is a systematic exposition of recent results which completely describe the group of automorphisms and the group of autoequivalences of generic analytic K3 surfaces. These groups, hard to determine in the algebraic case, admit a good description for generic analytic K3 surfaces, and are in fact seen to be closely interrelated.
