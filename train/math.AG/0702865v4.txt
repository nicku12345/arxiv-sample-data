We give upper bounds on the genus of a curve with general moduli assuming that it can be embedded in a projective nonsingular surface Y so that \dim(|C|) > 0. We find such bounds for all types of surfaces of intermediate Kodaira dimension and, under mild restrictions, for surfaces of general type whose minimal model Z satisfies the Castelnuovo inequality K_Z^2 \ge 3\chi(\O_Z) - 10. In this last case we obtain g \le 19. In the other cases considered the bounds are lower.
