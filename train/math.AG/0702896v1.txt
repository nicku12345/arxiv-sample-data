Clifford algebras are important structures in Geometric Algebra and Quantum Mechanics. They have allowed a formalization of the primitive operators in Quantum Theory. The algebras are built over vector spaces with dimension a power of 2 with addition and multiplication being effectively computable relative to the computability of their own spaces. Here we emphasize the algorithmic notions of the Clifford algebras. We recall the reduction of Clifford algebras into isomorphic structures also suitable for symbolic manipulation.
