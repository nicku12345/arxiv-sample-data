The subject of the present paper is Grothendieck's Lefschetz standard conjecture B(X). Our main result is that, if X is a projective smooth variety of dimension n and the conjecture B({\cal Y}) holds for the generic fibre {\cal Y} (of dimension n-1 over the field k(t)) of a suitable Lefschetz fibration of X, then the operator \Lambda_X-p^{n+1}_X is algebraic. If in addition p^{n+1}_X is algebraic, then B(X) is settled. Along the way we establish the algebraicity of the K\" unneth projectors \pi^i_X for i\neq n-1, n, n+1 under the above hypotheses.
