We assume that the existence and termination conjecture for flips holds. A complex projective manifold is said to be {\it of almost general type} if the intersection number of the canonical divisor with every very general curve is strictly positive. Let f be an algebraic fiber space from X to Y. Then the manifold X is of almost general type if every very general fiber F and the base space Y of f are of almost general type.
