Apart from math.AG/0608569, it contains the following applications of it. Let M be a simply connected, irreducible smooth complex projective variety of dimension n such that the Picard number of M is one. If the canonical line bundle K_M is ample, then the algebraic holonomy of TM is \text{GL}(n, {\mathbb C}). If K^{-1}_M is ample, \text{rank}(\text{NS}(M)) = 1, the biholomorphic automorphism group of M is finite, and M admits a K\"ahler--Einstein metric, then the algebraic holonomy of TM is {\rm GL}(n, {\mathbb C}).
