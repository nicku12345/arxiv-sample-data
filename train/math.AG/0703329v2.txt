We construct a space G^n_X and a rank n, generically etale family of closed subspaces in a separated ambient space X. The constructed pair satisfies a universal property of generically etale families of closed subspaces in X. This universal property is derived directly from the construction and does in particular not use the Hilbert scheme. The constructed space G^n_X is by its universal property canonically identified with a closed subspace of the Hilbert scheme.
