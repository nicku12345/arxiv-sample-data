In this paper we study ACM vector bundles \E of rank k \geq 3 on hypersurfaces X_r \subset\Pj^4 of degree r \geq 1. We consider here mainly the case of degree r = 4, which is the first unknown case in literature. Under some natural conditions for the bundle \E we derive a list of possible Chern classes (c_1,c_2,c_3) which may arise in the cases of rank k=3 and k=4, when r=4. For some cases among these we give the corresponding examples, the existence of all the other cases remaining under question.
