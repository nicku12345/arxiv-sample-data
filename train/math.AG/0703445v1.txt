Let T be a torus acting on \CC^n in such a way that, for all 1\leq k\leq n, the induced action on the grassmannian G(k,n) has only isolated fixed points. This paper proposes a natural, elementary, explicit description of the corresponding T-equivariant Schubert calculus. In a suitable natural basis of the T-equivariant cohomology, seen as a module over the T-equivariant cohomology of a point, it is formally the same as the ordinary cohomology of a grassmann bundle. The main result, useful for computational purposes, is that the T-equivariant cohomology of G(k,n) can be realized as the quotient of a ring generated by derivations on the exterior algebra of a free module of rank n over the T-equivariant cohomology of a point.
