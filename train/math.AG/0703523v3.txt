We study restrictions on cohomology algebras of Kaehler compact manifolds, not depending on the h^{p,q} numbers or the symplectic structure. To illustrate the effectiveness of these restrictions, we give a number of examples of compact symplectic manifolds satisfying the Lefschetz property but not having the cohomology algebra of a compact Kaehler manifold. We also prove the stability of these restrictions under products.
