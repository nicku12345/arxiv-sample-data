In this article we present a 3-dimensional analogue of a well-known theorem of E. Bombieri (in 1973) which characterizes the bi-canonical birationality of surfaces of general type. Let X be a projective minimal 3-fold of general type with \mathbb{Q}-factorial terminal singularities and the geometric genus p_g(X)\ge 5. We show that the 4-canonical map \phi_4 is {\it not} birational onto its image if and only if X is birationally fibred by a family \mathscr{C} of irreducible curves of geometric genus 2 with K_X\cdot C_0=1 where C_0 is a general irreducible member in \mathscr{C}.
