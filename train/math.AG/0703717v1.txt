Given an algebraic surface X, the Hilbert scheme X^{[n]} of n-points on X admits a contraction morphism to the n-fold symmetric product X^{(n)} with the extremal ray generated by a class \beta_n of a rational curve. We determine the two point extremal GW-invariants of X^{[n]} with respect to the class d\beta_n for a simply-connected projective surface X and the quantum first Chern class operator of the tautological bundle on X^{[n]}. The methods used are vertex algebraic description of H^*(X^{[n]}), the localization technique applied to X=\mathbb P^2, and a generalization of the reduction theorem of Kiem-J. Li to the case of meromorphic 2-forms.
