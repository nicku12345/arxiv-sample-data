We study the global structure of moduli spaces of quasi-isogenies of polarized p-divisible groups introduced by Rapoport and Zink. Using the corresponding results for non-polarized p-divisible groups from a previous paper, we determine their dimensions and their sets of connected components and of irreducible components.
