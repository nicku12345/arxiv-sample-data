Let X be an integral model at a prime p of a Shimura variety of PEL type having good reduction, associated to a reductive group G. To \mathbb{Z}_p reprsententations of the group G can be associated two kinds of sheaves : crystals on the special fiber of X, and locally constant \'etale sheaves on the generic fiber. We establish a comparison between the cohomology of these two kinds of sheaves.
