Let f,g be two algebraically independent regular functions from the smooth affine complex variety U to the affine line. The associated exponential Gauss-Manin systems on the affine line are defined to be the cohomology sheaves of the direct image of the exponential differential system \mathcal{O}_U e^g  with respect to f. We prove that its holomorphic solutions admit representations in terms of period integrals over topological chains with possibly closed support and with rapid decay condition.
