We present a four-parameter family of ordinary differential systems in dimension three with affine Weyl group symmetry of type D_4^{(1)}. By obtaining its first integral, we can reduce this system to the second-order non-linear ordinary differential equations of Painlev\'e type. We also study this system restricted its parameters. Each system can be obtained by connecting some invariant divisors in the system of type D_4^{(1)}. Each system admits affine Weyl group symmetry of types B_3^{(1)},G_2^{(1)},D_3^{(2)} and A_2^{(2)}, respectively. These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are new.
