We give a new approach to the symmetries of the Painlev\'e equations P_{V},P_{IV},P_{III} and P_{II}, respectively. Moreover, we make natural extensions to fourth-order analogues for each of the Painlev\'e equations P_{V} and P_{III}, respectively, which are natural in the sense that they preserve the symmetries.
