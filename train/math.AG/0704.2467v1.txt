We find and study four kinds of five-parameter family of six-dimensional coupled Painlev\'e III systems with affine Weyl group symmetry of types D_5^{(1)},B_5^{(1)} and D_6^{(2)}. We show that each system is equivalent by an explicit birational and symplectic transformation, respectively. We also show that we characterize each system from the viewpoint of holomorphy.
