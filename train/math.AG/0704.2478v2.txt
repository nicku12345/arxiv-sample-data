We find four kinds of six-parameter family of coupled Painlev\'e VI systems in dimension four with affine Weyl group symmetry of types B_6^{(1)}, D_6^{(1)} and D_7^{(2)}. Each system is the first example which gave higher-order Painlev\'e equations of types B_l^{(1)},D_l^{(1)} and D_l^{(2)}, respectively. Each system can be expressed as a polynomial Hamiltonian system. We show that these systems are equivalent by an explicit birational and symplectic transformation, respectively. By giving each holomorphy condition, we can recover each system. These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are new. We also give an explicit description of a confluence process from the system of type D_6^{(1)} to the system of type A_5^{(1)} by taking the coupling confluence process from the Painlev\'e VI system to the Painlev\'e V system.
