Let f: X -> Y be a smooth family of canonically polarized complex varieties over a smooth base. Generalizing the classical Shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture, Viehweg conjectured that Y is necessarily of log general type if the family has maximal variation. A somewhat stronger and more precise version of Viehweg's conjecture was shown by the authors in arXiv:math/0511378 in the case where Y is a quasi-projective surface. Assuming that the minimal model program holds, this very short paper proves the same result for projective base manifolds Y of arbitrary dimension.
