We prove that Nahm transform for integrable connections with a finite number of regular singularities and an irregular singularity of rank 1 on the Riemann sphere is equivalent -- up to considering integrable connections as holonomic \D-modules -- to minimal Laplace transform. We assume semi-simplicity and resonance-freeness conditions, and we work in the framework of objects with a parabolic structure. In particular, we describe the definition of the parabolic version of Laplace transform due to C. Sabbah. The proof of the main result relies on the study of a twisted de Rham complex.
