Let H and H' be two ample line bundles over a nonsingular projective surface X, and M(H) (resp. M(H')) the coarse moduli scheme of H-semistable (resp. H'-semistable) sheaves of fixed type (r=2,c_1,c_2). In a moduli-theoretic way that comes from elementary transforms, we connect M(H) and M(H') by a sequence of blowing-ups when walls separating H and H' are not necessarily good. As an application, we also consider the polarization change problem of Donaldson polynomials.
