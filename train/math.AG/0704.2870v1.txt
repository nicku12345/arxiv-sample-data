Let H and H' be two ample line bundles over a smooth projective surface X, and M(H) (resp. M(H')) the coarse moduli scheme of H-semistable (resp. H'-semistable) sheaves of fixed type (r,c_1,c_2). We construct a sequence of blowing-ups which describes how M(H) differs from M(H') not only when r=2 but also when r is arbitrary. Means we here utilize are elementary transforms and the notion of a sheaf with flag.
