We find and study a five-parameter family of four-dimensional coupled Painlev\'e V systems with affine Weyl group symmetry of type D_5^{(1)}. We then give an explicit description of a confluence from those systems to a four-parameter family of four-dimensional coupled Painlev\'e III systems with affine Weyl group symmetry of type B_4^{(1)}.
