Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus g\geq 2 over the complex numbers. A holomorphic triple (E_1,E_2,\phi) on X consists of two holomorphic vector bundles E_1 and E_2 over X and a holomorphic map \phi:E_2 \to E_1. There is a concept of stability for triples which depends on a real parameter \sigma. In this paper, we determine the Hodge polynomials of the moduli spaces of \sigma-stable triples with \rk(E_1)=3, \rk(E_2)=1, using the theory of mixed Hodge structures. This gives in particular the Poincar\'e polynomials of these moduli spaces. As a byproduct, we recover the Hodge polynomial of the moduli space of odd degree rank 3 stable vector bundles.
