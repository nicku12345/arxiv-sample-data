Thom (residual) polynomials in characteristic classes are used in the analysis of geometry of functional spaces. They serve as a tool in description of classes Poincar\'e dual to subvarieties of functions of prescribed types. We give explicit universal expressions for residual polynomials in spaces of functions on complex curves having isolated singularities and multisingularities, in terms of few characteristic classes. These expressions lead to a partial explicit description of a stratification of Hurwitz spaces.
