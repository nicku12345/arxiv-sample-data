In this paper, we prove that the log minimal model program in dimension d-1 implies the existence of log minimal models for effective lc pairs (eg of nonnegative Kodaira dimension) in dimension d. In fact, we prove that the same conclusion follows from a weaker assumption, namely, the log minimal model program with scaling in dimension d-1. This enables us to prove that effective lc pairs in dimension five have log minimal models. We also give new proofs of the existence of log minimal models for effective lc pairs in dimension four and the Shokurov reduction theorem. Other applications appear in a paper of Birkar-Paun.
