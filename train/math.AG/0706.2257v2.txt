In this note we apply Guillen-Navarro descent theorem, \cite{GN02}, to define a descent variant of the algebraic K-theory of varieties over a field of characteristic zero, \mathcal{KD}(X), which coincides with \mathcal{K}(X) for smooth varieties. After a result of Haesemeyer, this new theory is equivalent to the homotopy algebraic K-theory introduced by Weibel. We also prove that there is a natural weight filtration on the groups KH_\ast(X).
