A Gizatullin surface is a normal affine surface V over \bf C, which can be completed by a zigzag; that is, by a linear chain of smooth rational curves. In this paper we deal with the question of uniqueness of \bf C^*-actions and \bf A^1-fibrations on such a surface V up to automorphisms. The latter fibrations are in one to one correspondence with \bf C_+-actions on V considered up to a "speed change".   Non-Gizatullin surfaces are known to admit at most one \bf A^1-fibration V\to S up to an isomorphism of the base S. Moreover an effective \bf C^{*}-action on them, if it does exist, is unique up to conjugation and inversion t\mapsto t^{-1} of \bf C^*. Obviously uniqueness of \bf C^*-actions fails for affine toric surfaces; however we show in this case that there are at most two conjugacy classes of \bf A^1-fibrations. There is a further interesting family of non-toric Gizatullin surfaces, called the Danilov-Gizatullin surfaces, where there are in general several conjugacy classes of \bf C^*-actions and \bf A^1-fibrations.   In the present paper we obtain a criterion as to when \bf A^1-fibrations of Gizatullin surfaces are conjugate up to an automorphism of V and the base S. We exhibit as well a large subclasses of Gizatullin \bf C^{*}-surfaces for which a \bf C^*-action is essentially unique and for which there are at most two conjugacy classes of \bf A^1-fibrations over \bf A^1.
