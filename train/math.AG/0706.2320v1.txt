In his investigation on large K-automorphism groups of an algebraic curve, Stichtenoth obtained an upper bound on the order of the first ramification group of an algebraic curve \cX defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. Stichtenoth's bound has raised the problem of classifying all \K-automorphism groups G of \cX with the following property: There is a point P\in \cX for which \begin{equation} |G_P^{(1)}|>\frac{p}{p-1}g. \end{equation} Such a classification is obtained here by proving Theorem 1.3
