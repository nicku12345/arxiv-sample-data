For quasihomogeneous isolated hypersurface singularities, the logarithmic comparison theorem has been characterized explicitly by Holland and Mond. In the non quasihomogeneous case, we give a necessary condition for the logarithmic comparison theorem in terms of the Gauss-Manin system of the singularity. It shows in particular that the logarithmic comparison theorem can hold for a non quasihomogeneous singularity only if 1 is an eigenvalue of the monodromy.
