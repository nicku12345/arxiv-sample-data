We consider the Chow ring with rational coefficients of the Jacobian of a curve. Assume D is a divisor in a base point free g^r_d of the curve such that the canonical divisor K is a multiple of the divisor D. We find relations between tautological cycles. We give applications for curves having a degree d covering of P^1 whose ramification points are all of order d, and then for hyperelliptic curves.
