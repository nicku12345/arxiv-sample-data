Let V be a complex nonsingular projective 3-fold of general type. We prove P_{12}(V)>0 and P_{24}(V)>1 (which answers an open problem of J. Kollar and S. Mori). We also prove that the canonical volume has an universal lower bound \text{Vol}(V) \geq 1/2660 and that the pluri-canonical map \Phi_m is birational onto its image for all m\geq 77. As an application of our method, we prove Fletcher's conjecture on weighted hyper-surface 3-folds with terminal quotient singularities. Another featured result is the optimal lower bound \text{Vol}(V)\geq {1/420} among all those 3-folds V with \chi({\mathcal O}_V)\leq 1.
