It is now a classical result that an algebraic space locally of finite type over \mathbf{C} is analytifiable if and only if it is locally separated. In this paper we study non-archimedean analytifications of algebraic spaces. We construct a quotient for any etale non-archimedean analytic equivalence relation whose diagonal is a closed immersion, and deduce that any separated algebraic space locally of finite type over any non-archimedean field k is analytifiable in both the category of rigid spaces and the category of analytic spaces over k. Also, though local separatedness remains a necessary condition for analytifiability in either of these categories, we present many surprising examples of non-analytifiable locally separated smooth algebraic spaces over k that can even be defined over the prime field.
