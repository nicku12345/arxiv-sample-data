Let \{P_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq r} and \{Q_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq r} be two collections of Brauer Severi surfaces (resp. conics) over a field k. We show that the subgroup generated by the P_i's in Br(k) is the same as the subgroup generated by the Q_i's \iff \Pi P_i  is birational to \Pi Q_i. Moreover in this case \Pi P_i and \Pi Q_i represent the same class in M(k), the Grothendieck ring of k-varieties. The converse holds if char(k)=0. Some of the above implications also hold over a general noetherian base scheme.
