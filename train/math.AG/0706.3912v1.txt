Twisted ind-Grassmannians are ind-varieties \GG obtained as direct limits of Grassmannians G(r_m,V^{r_m}), for m\in\ZZ_{>0}, under embeddings \phi_m:G(r_m,V^{r_m})\to G(r_{m+1}, V^{r_{m+1}}) of degree greater than one. It has been conjectured in \cite{PT} and \cite{DP} that any vector bundle of finite rank on a twisted ind-Grassmannian is trivial. We prove this conjecture under the assumption that the ind-Grassmannian \GG is sufficiently twisted, i.e. that \lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{r_m}{\deg \phi_1...\deg\phi_m}=0.
