Given a vector bundle E of rank r and degree d on a curve C of genus g, one can associate to E in a natural way several other vector bundles. For example, one can take wedge powers of E. If E is generated by global sections, the kernel of the evaluation map of sections is again a vector bundle. Also, new vector bundles can be produced by taking elementary transformations centered at a fixed point. Under suitable conditions on degree and rank, these constructions can be carried out globally. While all this processes seem quite elementary, very little is known about the resulting maps. The purpose of this paper is to fill in this gap.
