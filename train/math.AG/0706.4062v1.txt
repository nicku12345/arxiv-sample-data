In previous papers, there were computed the Poincare series of some (multi-index) filtrations on the ring of germs of functions on a rational surface singularity. These Poincare series were written as the integer parts of certain fractional power series, an interpretation of whom was not given. Here we show that, up to a simple change of variables, these fractional power series are specializations of the equivariant Poincare series for filtrations on the ring of germs of functions on the universal abelian cover of the surface singularity. We compute these equivariant Poincare series.
