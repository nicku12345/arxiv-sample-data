D. Jaffe and D. Ruberman proved in 1997 that a sextic hypersurface in \mathbb{P}^3 has at most 65 nodes (the bound is sharp by Barth's construction).   Almost at the same time, J. Wahl proposed a much shorter proof of the same result, by proving that a linear code V\subset \F^{66} with weights in \{24,32,40\} has dimension \dim(V)\leq12.   He claimed that Jaffe-Ruberman's theorem follows as a corollary since the code associated to a sextic with n nodes has dimension at least n-53 and an incorrect result stated by Casnati and Catanese asserted that the possible cardinalities of an even set of nodes on a sextic were only 24, 32 and 40.   Recently Catanese and Tonoli showed that the possible cardinalities of an even set of nodes on a sextic are exactly 24, 32, 40, 56. According to the above cardinalities, the theorem of Jaffe and Ruberman reduces to the following:   Let V\subset \F^{66} be a code with weights in \{24,32,40,56\}. Then \dim(V)\leq12.   In this short note we give an elementary proof of this theorem using and integrating Wahl's ideas.
