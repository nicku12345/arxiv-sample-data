In this paper, we prove a generalization of Reznikov's theorem which says that the Chern-Simons classes and in particular the Deligne Chern classes (in degrees >1) are torsion, of a flat bundle on a smooth complex projective variety. We consider the case of a smooth quasi--projective variety with an irreducible smooth divisor at infinity. We define the Chern-Simons classes of Deligne's canonical extension of a flat vector bundle with unipotent monodromy at infinity, which lift the Deligne Chern classes and prove that these classes are torsion.
