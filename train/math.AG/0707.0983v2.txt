Let C be an algebraic curve of genus g\ge2. A coherent system on C consists of a pair (E,V), where E is an algebraic vector bundle over C of rank n and degree d and V is a subspace of dimension k of the space of sections of E. The stability of the coherent system depends on a parameter \alpha. We study the geometry of the moduli space of coherent systems for 0<d\le2n. We show that these spaces are irreducible whenever they are non-empty and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for non-emptiness.
