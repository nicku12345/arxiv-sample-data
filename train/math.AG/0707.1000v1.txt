Let O_X (resp. D_X) be the sheaf of holomorphic functions (resp. the sheaf of linear differential operators with holomorphic coefficients) on X (=the complex affine n-space). Let Y be a locally weakly quasi-homogeneous free divisor defined by a polynomial f. In this paper we prove that, locally, the annihilating ideal of 1/f^k over D_X is generated by linear differential operators of order 1 (for k big enough). For this purpose we prove a vanishing theorem for the extension groups of a certain logarithmic D_X--module with O_X. The logarithmic D_X--module is naturally associated with Y. This result is related to the so called Logarithmic Comparison Theorem.
