Statements analogous to the Hard Lefschetz Theorem (HLT) and the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations (HRR) hold in a variety of contexts: they impose restrictions on the cohomology algebra of a smooth compact K\"ahler manifold or on the intersection cohomology of a projective toric variety; they restrict the local monodromy of a polarized variation of Hodge structure; they impose conditions on the possible f-vectors of convex polytopes. While the statements of these theorems depend on the choice of a K\"ahler class, or its analog, there is usually a cone of possible K\"ahler classes. It is then natural to ask whether the HLT and HRR remain true in a mixed context. In this note we present a unified approach to proving the mixed HLT and HRR, generalizing the previously known results, and proving it in new cases such as the intersection cohomology of non-rational polytopes.
