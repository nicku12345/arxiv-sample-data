Going one step further in Zak's classification of Scorza varieties with secant defect equal to one, we characterize the Veronese embedding of \P^n given by the complete linear system of quadrics and its smooth projections from a point as the only smooth irreducible complex and non-degenerate projective subvarieties of \P^N that can be projected isomorphically into \P^{2n} when N\geq\binom{n+2}{2}-2.
