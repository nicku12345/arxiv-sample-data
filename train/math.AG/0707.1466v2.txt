In this paper we continue the investigation of coherent systems of type (n,d,k) on the projective line which are stable with respect to some value of a parameter \alpha. We consider the case k=1 and study the variation of the moduli spaces with \alpha. We determine inductively the first and last moduli spaces and the flip loci, and give an explicit description for ranks 2 and 3. We also determine the Hodge polynomials explicitly for ranks 2 and 3 and in certain cases for arbitrary rank.
