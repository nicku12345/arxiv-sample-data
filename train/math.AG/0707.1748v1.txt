In the dictionary between the language of (algebraic integrable) connections and that of (algebraic) \cD-modules, to compare the definitions of inverse images for connections and \cD-modules is easy. But the comparison between direct images for connections (the classical construction of the Gauss-Manin connection for smooth morphisms) and for \cD-modules, although known to specialists, has been explicitly proved only recently in a paper of Dimca, Maaref, Sabbah and Saito in 2000, where the authors' main technical tool was M. Saito's equivalence between the derived category of \cD-modules and a localized category of differential complexes. The aim of this short paper is to give a simplified summary of the [DMSS] argument, and to propose an alternative proof of this comparison which is simpler, in the sense that it does not use Saito equivalence. Moreover, our alternative strategy of comparison works in a context which is a precursor to the Gauss-Manin connection (at the level of f^{-1}\cD_Y-modules, for a morphism f:X\to Y), and may be of some intrinsic interest.
