We construct the coarse moduli space \cM_{qc}(\sigma) of quadratic line complexes with a fixed Segre symbol \sigma as well as the moduli space \cM_{ss}(\sigma) of the corresponding singular surfaces. We show that the map associating to a quadratic line complex its singular surface induces a morphism \pi: \cM_{qc}(\sigma) \ra \cM_{ss}(\sigma). Finally we deduce that the varieties of cosingular quadratic line complexes are almost always curves.
