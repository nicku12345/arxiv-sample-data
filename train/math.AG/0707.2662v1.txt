The Getzler's formula relates the S_n-equivariant Hodge-Deligne polynomial of the space of ordered tuples of distinct points on a given variety X with the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of X. We obtain the analogue of this formula for the case when X has a nontrivial automorphism group. Collecting together all strata of \mathcal{M}_2 with different automorphism groups, we derive a formula for the S_n-equivariant Euler characteristic of \mathcal{M}_{2,n}.
