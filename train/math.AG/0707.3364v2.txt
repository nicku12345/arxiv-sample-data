Let \cM_r denote the moduli space of semi-stable rank-r vector bundles with trivial determinant over a smooth projective curve C of genus g. In this paper we study the base locus \cB_r \subset \cM_r of the linear system of the determinant line bundle \cL over \cM_r, i.e., the set of semi-stable rank-r vector bundles without theta divisor. We construct base points in \cB_{g+2} over any curve C, and base points in \cB_4 over any hyperelliptic curve.
