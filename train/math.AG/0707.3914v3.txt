The paper is concerned with `geometrization' of smooth (i.e. with open stabilizers) representations of the automorphism group of universal domains, and with the properties of `geometric' representations of such groups. As an application, we calculate the cohomology groups of several classes of smooth representations of the automorphism group of an algebraically closed extension of infinite transcendence degree of an algebraically closed field.
