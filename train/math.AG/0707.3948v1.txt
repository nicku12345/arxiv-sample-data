We prove the potential density of rational points on the variety of lines of a sufficiently general cubic fourfold defined over a number field, where ``sufficiently general'' means that a condition of Terasoma type is satisfied. These varieties have trivial canonical bundle and have geometric Picard group equal to \mathbb{Z}.
