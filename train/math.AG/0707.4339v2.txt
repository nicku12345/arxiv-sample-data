In this paper we classify all free actions of finite groups on Calabi-Yau complete intersection of 4 quadrics in \PP^7, up to projective equivalence. We get some examples of smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds with large nonabelian fundamental groups. We also observe the relation between some of these examples and moduli of polarized abelian surfaces.
