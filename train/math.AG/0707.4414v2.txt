The purpose of this paper is to lay the foundations for the theory of higher rank b-divisorial algebras of Shokurov type. We develop techniques to deal with such objects and propose two natural conjectures regarding Shokurov algebras and adjoint algebras. We confirm these conjectures in the case of affine curves.
