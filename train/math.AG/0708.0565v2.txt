In this paper we study effective recursion formulae for computing intersection numbers of mixed \psi and \kappa classes on moduli spaces of curves. By using the celebrated Witten-Kontsevich theorem, we generalize Mulase-Safnuk form of Mirzakhani's recursion and prove a recursion formula of higher Weil-Petersson volumes. We also present recursion formulae to compute intersection pairings in the tautological rings of moduli spaces of curves.
