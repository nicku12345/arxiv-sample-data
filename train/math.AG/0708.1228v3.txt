We study the "generic" degenerations of curves with two singular points when the points merge. First, the notion of generic degeneration is defined precisely. Then a method to classify the possible results of generic degenerations is proposed in the case of linear singularity types.   We discuss possible bounds on the singularity invariants of the resulting type in terms of the initial types. In particular the strict upper bound on the resulting multiplicity is proved and a sufficient condition for \delta=const collision is given.
