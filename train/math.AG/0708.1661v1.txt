We provide the full classification of algebraic embeddings of \mathbb{C}^* into \mathbb{C}^2 satisfying certain regularity condition, which conjecturally holds for all algebraic maps from \mathbb{C}^* into \mathbb{C}^2. The resulting list comprises 1 smooth family, 18 discrete families and 4 special cases. Any embedding known to us can be reduced to one of this list by a de Jonqui\`ere transform and a suitable change of variables.   The classification uses in general tools from previous work "Complex algebraic curves via Poincare--Hopf formula. I. Parametric lines." (Pacific. J. Math. 229 (2007) No. 2, 307--338): we carefully estimate Milnor numbers of singularities that may appear in the embedding of \mathbb{C}^*. We use the regularity condition to bound the sum of so--called codimensions of singular points. The detailed discussion of this condition can be found in http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~mcboro/pliki/artykuly/curv4.pdf
