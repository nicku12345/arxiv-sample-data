Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, and G_0 be a Barsotti-Tate group (or p-divisible group) over k. We denote by S the "algebraic" local moduli in characteristic p of G_0, by G the universal deformation of G_0 over S, and by U\subset S the ordinary locus of G. The etale part of G over U gives rise to a monodromy representation \rho of the fundamental group of U on the Tate module of G. Motivated by a famous theorem of Igusa, we prove in this article that \rho is surjective if G_0 is connected and HW-cyclic. This latter condition is equivalent to that Oort's a-number of G_0 equals 1, and it is satisfied by all connected one-dimensional Barsotti-Tate groups over k.
