We give a natural family of Bridgeland stability conditions on the derived category of a smooth projective complex surface S and describe ``wall-crossing behavior'' for objects with the same invariants as \cO_C(H) when H generates Pic(S) and C \in |H|. If, in addition, S is a K3 or Abelian surface, we use this description to construct a sequence of fine moduli spaces of Bridgeland-stable objects via Mukai flops and generalized elementary modifications of the universal coherent sheaf. We also discover a natural generalization of Thaddeus' stable pairs for curves embedded in the moduli spaces.
