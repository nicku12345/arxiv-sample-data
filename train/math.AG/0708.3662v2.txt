We prove that there exists a universal constant r_3 such that if X is a smooth projective threefold over \mathbb{C} with non-negative Kodaira dimension, then the linear system |r K_X| admits a fibration that is birational to the Iitaka fibration as soon as r \geq r_3 and sufficiently divisible. This gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Hacon and McKernan in the case of threefolds. Viehweg and Zhang have posted a stronger result along these lines using different methods.
