Let X be a rational nonsingular compact connected real algebraic surface. Denote by Aut(X) the group of real algebraic automorphisms of X. We show that the group Aut(X) acts n-transitively on X, for all natural integers n. As an application we give a new and simpler proof of the fact that two rational nonsingular compact connected real algebraic surfaces are isomorphic if and only if they are homeomorphic as topological surfaces.
