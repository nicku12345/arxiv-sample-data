Let X be a complex projective algebraic variety with Gorenstein quotient singularities and \X a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack having X as its coarse moduli space. We show that the CSM class c^{SM}(X) coincides with the pushforward to X of the total Chern class c(T_{I\X}) of the inertia stack I\X. We also show that the stringy Chern class c_{str}(X) of X, whenever is defined, coincides with the pushforward to X of the total Chern class c(T_{II\X}) of the double inertia stack II\X. Some consequences concerning stringy/orbifold Hodge numbers are deduced.
