This work is inspired by conversations with Izzet Coskun and Joe Harris. We run the log minimal model program for the Kontsevich space of stable maps \bar{\mathcal M}_{0,0}(\mathbb P^{3}, 3) and give modular interpretations to all the intermediate spaces appearing in the process. In particular, we show that one component of the Hilbert scheme \mathcal H_{3,0,3} is the flip of \bar{\mathcal M}_{0,0}(\mathbb P^{3}, 3) over the Chow variety. Finally as an easy corollary we obtain that \bar{\mathcal M}_{0,0}(\mathbb P^{3}, 3) is a Mori dream space.
