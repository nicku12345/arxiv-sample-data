We describe the local structure of an irreducible algebraic monoid M at an idempotent element e. When e is minimal, we show that M is an induced variety over the kernel MeM (a homogeneous space) with fibre the two-sided stabilizer M_e (a connected affine monoid having a zero element and a dense unit group). This yields the irreducibility of stabilizers and centralizers of idempotents when M is normal, and criteria for normality and smoothness of an arbitrary M. Also, we show that M is an induced variety over an abelian variety, with fiber a connected affine monoid having a dense unit group.
