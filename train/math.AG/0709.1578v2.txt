Let X be a complex analytic manifold. Given a closed subspace Y\subset X of pure codimension p>0, we consider the sheaf of local algebraic cohomology H^p_{[Y]}({\cal O}_X), and {\cal L}(Y,X)\subset H^p_{[Y]}({\cal O}_X) the intersection homology D_X-Module of Brylinski-Kashiwara. We give here an algebraic characterization of the spaces Y such that L(Y,X) coincides with H^p_{[Y]}({\cal O}_X), in terms of Bernstein-Sato functional equations.
