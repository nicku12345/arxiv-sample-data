Let X be an irreducible smooth projective curve defined over complex numbers, S= {p_1, p_2,...,p_n} \subset X a finite set of closed points and N > 1 a fixed integer. For any pair (r,d) in Z X Z/N, there exists a parabolic vector bundle R_{r,d,*} on X, with parabolic structure over S and all parabolic weights in Z/N, that has the following property: Take any parabolic vector bundle E_* of rank r on X whose parabolic points are contained in S, all the parabolic weights are in Z/N and the parabolic degree is d. Then E_* is parabolic semistable if and only if there is no nonzero parabolic homomorphism from R_{r,d,*} to E_*.
