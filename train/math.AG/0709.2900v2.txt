The author wrote this note after being asked about the existence of compactifications of algebraic spaces. Subsequent to posting the article to the math arXiv, the author learned from Yutakaa Matsuura that the results of this paper had been proved by Raoult in 1971, using the same techniques. Since Raoult's article may be unknown to those working in the field, the author is keeping this preprint on the arXiv server. However, he makes no claim of originality.
