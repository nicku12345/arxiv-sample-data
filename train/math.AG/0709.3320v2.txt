Necessary and sufficient conditions are given (in terms of monodromy) for extending a family of smooth curves over an open subset U of S to a family of stable curves over S. More precisely, we introduce the abelian monodromy extension (AME) property and show that the standard Deligne-Mumford compactification is the unique, maximal AME compactification of the moduli space of curves. We also show that the Baily-Borel compactification is the unique, maximal projective AME compactification of the moduli space of abelian varieties.
