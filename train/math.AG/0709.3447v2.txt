v2: We improved a little bit according to the referee's wishes.   v1: On X projective smooth over a field k, Pink and Roessler conjecture that the dimension of the Hodge cohomology of an invertible n-torsion sheaf L is the same as the one of its a-th power L^a if a is prime to n, under the assumptions that X lifts to W_2(k) and dim X\le p, if k has characteristic p>0. They show this if k has characteristic 0 and if n is prime to p in characteristic p>0. We show the conjecture in characteristic p>0 if n=p assuming in addition that X is ordinary (in the sense of Bloch-Kato).
