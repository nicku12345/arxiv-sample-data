Working over C, we show that, apart possibly from a unique limit point, the possible values of multi-point Seshadri constant for general points on smooth projective surfaces form a discrete set. In addition to its theoretical interest, this result is of practical value, which we demonstrate by giving significantly improved explicit lower bounds for Seshadri constants on P^2 and new results about ample divisors on blow ups of P^2 at general points.
