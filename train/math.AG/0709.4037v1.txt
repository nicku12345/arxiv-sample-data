We study the log canonical models of the moduli space MBar_{0,n} of pointed stable genus zero curves with respect to the standard log canonical divisors K+aD, where D denotes the boundary. In particular we show that, as a formal consequence of a conjecture by Fulton regarding the ample cone of MBar_{0,n}, these log canonical models are equal to certain of Hassett's weighted pointed curve spaces.
