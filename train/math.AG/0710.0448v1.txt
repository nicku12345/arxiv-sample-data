In this paper we introduce the category of stratified Pro-modules and the notion of induced object in this category. We propose a translation of a Morihiko Saito equivalence result using the dual language of Pro-objects. So we prove an equivalence between the derived category of stratified Pro-modules and the category of Pro-differential complexes. We also supply a comparison with the notion of Crystal in Pro-module (introduced by P. Deligne in 1960).
