A \mathbb Q-conic bundle germ is a proper morphism from a threefold with only terminal singularities to the germ (Z \ni o) of a normal surface such that fibers are connected and the anti-canonical divisor is relatively ample. We obtain the complete classification of \mathbb Q-conic bundle germs when the base surface germ is singular. This is a generalization of our previous paper math/0603736, which further assumed that the fiber over o is irreducible.
