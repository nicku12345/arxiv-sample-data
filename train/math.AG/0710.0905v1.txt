The simplest example of an ind-Grassmannian is the infinite projective space \mathbf P^\infty. The Barth-Van de Ven-Tyurin (BVT) Theorem, proved more than 30 years ago \cite{BV}, \cite{T}, \cite{Sa} (see also a recent proof by A. Coand\u{a} and G. Trautmann, \cite{CT}), claims that any vector bundle of finite rank on \mathbf P^\infty is isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles. In the last decade natural examples of infinite flag varieties (or flag ind-varieties) have arisen as homogeneous spaces of locally linear ind-groups, \cite{DPW}, \cite{DiP}. In the present paper we concentrate our attention to the special case of ind-Grassmannians, i.e. to inductive limits of Grassmannians of growing dimension.
