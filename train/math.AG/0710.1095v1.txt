Given three natural numbers k,l,d such that k+l=d(d+3)/2, the Zeuthen number N_{d}(l) is the number of nonsingular complex algebraic curves of degree d passing through k points and tangent to l lines in \PP^2. It does not depend on the generic configuration C of points and lines chosen. If the points and lines are real, the corresponding number N_{d}^\RR(l,C) of real curves usually depends on the configuration chosen. We use Mikhalkin's tropical correspondence theorem to prove that for two lines the real Zeuthen problem is maximal: there exists a configuration C such that N_{d}^\RR(2,C)=N_{d}(2). The correspondence theorem reduces the computation to counting certain lattice paths with multiplicities.
