We prove that the quantum cohomology ring of any minuscule or cominuscule homogeneous space, specialized at q=1, is semisimple. This implies that complex conjugation defines an algebra automorphism of the quantum cohomology ring localized at the quantum parameter. We check that this involution coincides with the strange duality defined in a previous paper. We deduce Vafa-Intriligator type formulas for the Gromov-Witten invariants.
