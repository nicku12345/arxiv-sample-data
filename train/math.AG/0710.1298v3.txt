We study a relationship between two genus 2 curves whose jacobians are isogenous with kernel equal to a maximal isotropic subspace of p-torsion points with respect to the Weil pairing. For p = 3 we find an explicit relationship between the set of Weierstrass points of the two curves extending the classical results of F. Richelot (1837) and G. Humbert (1901) in the case p = 2.
