We study the Severi variety V_{d,g} of plane curves of degree d and geometric genus g. Corresponding to every such variety, there is a one-parameter family of genus g stable curves whose numerical invariants we compute. Building on the work of Caporaso and Harris, we derive a recursive formula for the degrees of the Hodge bundle on the families in question. For d large enough, these families induce moving curves in \bar{M}_g. We use this to derive lower bounds for the slopes of effective divisors on \bar{M}_g. Another application of our results is to various enumerative problems on V_{d,g}.
