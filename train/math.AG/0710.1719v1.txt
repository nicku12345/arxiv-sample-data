Let X be the blow-up of a smooth projective 4-fold Y along a smooth curve C and let E be the exceptional divisor. Assume that X is a Fano manifold and has an elementary extremal contraction \phi: X \to Z of (3,1)-type such that E is \phi-ample (recall that a contraction map for a 4-fold is called (3,1)-type if the exceptional locus is a divisor and its image is a curve). We show that if the exceptional divisor of \phi is smooth, then Y is isomorphic to \mathbb{P}^{4} and C is an elliptic curve of degree 4.
