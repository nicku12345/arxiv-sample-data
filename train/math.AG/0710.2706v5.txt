We prove that the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem holds on rational surfaces in positive characteristic by means of the lifting property to W_2(k) of certain log pairs on smooth rational surfaces. As a corollary, the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem holds on log del Pezzo surfaces in positive characteristic.
