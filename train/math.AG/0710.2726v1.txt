This is my PhD Thesis, part of it has published in Acta Mathematica Sinica. In this paper, a class of morphisms which have a kind of singularity weaker than normal crossing is considered. We construct the obstruction such that the so-called semi-stable log structures exists if and only if the obstruction vanishes. In the case of no power, if the obstruction vanishes, then the semi-stable log structure is unique up to a unique isomorphism. So we obtain a kind of canonical structures on this family of morphisms.
