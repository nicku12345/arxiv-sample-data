The twistor space of representations on an open variety maps to a weight two space of local monodromy transformations around a divisor component at infinty. The space of \sigma-invariant sections of this slope-two bundle over the twistor line is a real 3 dimensional space whose parameters correspond to the complex residue of the Higgs field, and the real parabolic weight of a harmonic bundle.
