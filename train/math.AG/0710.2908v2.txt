The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we survey known results about theta dualities on moduli spaces of sheaves on curves and surfaces. Secondly, we establish new such dualities in the surface case. Among others, the case of elliptic K3 surfaces is studied in detail; we propose further conjectures which are shown to imply strange duality.
