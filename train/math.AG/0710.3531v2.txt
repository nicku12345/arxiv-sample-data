Let X be a smooth Fano manifold equipped with a `` nice '' n-blocks collection in the sense of \cite{cm2} and \mathcal {F} a coherent sheaf on X. Assume that X is Fano and that all blocks are coherent sheaves. Here we prove that \mathcal {F} has regularity -\infty in the sense of \cite{cm2} if {Supp}(\mathcal {F}) is finite, the converse being true under mild assumptions. The corresponding result is also true when X has a geometric collection in the sense of \cite{cm1}.
