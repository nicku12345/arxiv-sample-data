In this note we give a numerical criterion that expresses the condition that an abelian variety be simple in terms of an invariant that is closely related to the s-invariant of Ein-Cutkosky-Lazarsfeld. The criterion yields new examples where s-invariants are irrational. It may also be viewed as a statement about the geometry of the ample cone.
