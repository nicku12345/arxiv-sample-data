In this paper, the Euler characteristic formula for projective logarithmic minimal degenerations of surfaces with Kodaira dimension zero over a 1-dimensional complex disk is proved under a reasonable assumption and as its application, the singularity of logarithmic minimal degenerations are determined in the abelian or hyperelliptic case. By globalizing this local analysis of singular fibres via generalized canonical bundle formulae due to Fujino-Mori, we bound the number of singular fibres of abelian fibred Calabi-Yau threefolds from above,which was previously done by Oguiso in the potentially good reduction case.
