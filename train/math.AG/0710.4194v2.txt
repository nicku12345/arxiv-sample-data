The notions Hodge-Newton decomposition and Hodge-Newton filtration for F-crystals are due to Katz and generalize Messing's result on the existence of the local-\'etale filtration for p-divisible groups. Recently, some of Katz's classical results have been generalized by Kottwitz to the context of F-crystals with additional structures and by Moonen to \mu-ordinary p-divisible groups. In this paper, we discuss further generalizations to the situation of crystals in characteristic p and of p-divisible groups with additional structure by endomorphisms.
