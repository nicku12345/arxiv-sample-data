Building on the work of Nogin \cite{Nogin}, we prove that the braid group B_4 acts transitively on full exceptional collections of vector bundles on Fano threefolds with b_2=1 and b_3=0. Equivalently, this group acts transitively on the set of simple helices (considered up to a shift in the derived category) on such a Fano threefold. We also prove that on threefolds with b_2=1 and very ample anticanonical class, every exceptional coherent sheaf is locally free.
