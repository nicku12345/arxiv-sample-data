The existence is proved of two new families of locally Cohen-Macaulay sextic threefolds in \mathbb{P}^5, which are not quadratically normal. These threefolds arise naturally in the realm of first order congruences of lines as focal loci and in the study of the completely exceptional Monge-Amp\`ere equations. One of these families comes from a smooth congruence of multidegree (1,3,3) which is a smooth Fano fourfold of index two and genus 9.
