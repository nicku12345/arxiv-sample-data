This article is based on a talk delivered at the RIMS--OCAMI Joint International Conference on Geometry Related to Integrable Systems in September, 2007. Its aim is to review a recent progress in the Hitchin integrable systems and character varieties of the fundamental groups of Riemann surfaces. A survey on geometric aspects of these character varieties is also provided as we develop the exposition from a simple case to more elaborate cases.
