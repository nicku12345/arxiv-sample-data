We prove that a complete family of linearly non-degenerate rational curves of degree e > 2 in \mathbb{P}^n has at most n-1 moduli. For e = 2 we prove that such a family has at most n moduli. It is unknown whether or not this is the best possible result. The general method involves exhibiting a map from the base of a family X to the Grassmaninian of e-planes in \mathbb{P}^n and analyzing the resulting map on cohomology.
