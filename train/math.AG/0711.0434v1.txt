Our purpose is to make a contribution to the foundation of the theory of formal scheme. We are interested particularly in non-Noetherian or non-adic formal schemes, which have been little studied. We redefine the formal scheme as a proringed space and study its basic properties. We also find several examples of non-adic formal schemes.
