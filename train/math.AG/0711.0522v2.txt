In this article, we first give some elementary proprieties of monoids and fans, then construct a toric scheme over an arbitrary ring, from a given fan. Using Valuative Criterion, we prove that this scheme is separated and give the sufficient and necessary condition when it is proper. We also study the regularity and logarithmic regularity of it. Finally we study the morphisms of toric schemes induced by the homomorphisms of fans.
