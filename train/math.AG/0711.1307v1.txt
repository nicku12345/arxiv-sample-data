Green and Griffiths have introduced several notions of singularities associated with normal functions, especially in connection with middle dimensional primitive Hodge classes. In this note, by using the more elementary aspects of the Decomposition Theorem, we define global and local singularities associated with primitive middle dimensional cohomology classes and by using the Relative Hard Lefschetz Theorem, we show that these singularities detect the global and local triviality of the primitive class. In a final section, we write-up a classical inductive argument relating the Hodge conjecture to the local non-vanishing of primitive classes.
