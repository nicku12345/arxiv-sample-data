Let F:\Cn \to \Cn be a polynomial mapping in Yagzhev's form,i.e. F(x_1,\ld,x_n)=(x_1+H_1(x_1,\ld,x_n),\ld,x_n+H_n(x_1,\ld,x_n)), where H_i are homogenous polynomials of degree 3. In this paper we show that if \Jac(F) \in \mathbb{C}^* and the Jacobian matrix of F is symmetric, then all the polynomials x_i+H_i(x_1,\ld,x_n) are irreducible as elements of the ring \mathbb{C}[x_1,\ld,x_n].
