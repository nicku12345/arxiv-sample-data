This paper studies the defect of terminal Gorenstein Fano 3 folds. I determine a bound on the defect of terminal Gorenstein Fano 3-folds of Picard rank 1 that do not contain a plane. I give a general bound for quartic 3-folds and indicate how to study the defect of terminal Gorenstein Fano 3-folds with Picard rank 1 that contain a plane.
