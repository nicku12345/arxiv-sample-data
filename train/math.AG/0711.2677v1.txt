In tropical geometry, given a curve in a toric variety, one defines a corresponding graph embedded in Euclidean space. We study the problem of reversing this process for curves of genus zero and one. Our methods focus on describing curves by parameterizations, not by their defining equations; we give parameterizations by rational functions in the genus zero case and by non-archimedean elliptic functions in the genus one case. For genus zero curves, those graphs which can be lifted can be characterized in a completely combinatorial manner. For genus one curves, show that certain conditions identified by Mikhalkin are sufficient and we also identify a new necessary condition.
