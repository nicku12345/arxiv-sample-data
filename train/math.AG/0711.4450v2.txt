We show some of the conjectures of Pappas and Rapoport concerning the moduli stack of \mathcal{G}-torsors on a curve C, where \mathcal{G} is a semisimple Bruhat-Tits group scheme on C. In particular we prove the analog of the uniformization theorem of Drinfeld-Simpson in this setting. Furthermore we apply this to compute the connected components of these moduli stacks and to calculate the Picard group of the stack of torsors in case \mathcal{G} is simply connected.
