It is shown that the map from the Jacobian of the spectral curve to the moduli of stable bundles of rank 2 is generically simply branched along an irreducible divisor. This observation falsifies the key step in the "abelianization of the SU(2) WZW connection" presented in a recent paper [Yoshida, Annals 2006]
