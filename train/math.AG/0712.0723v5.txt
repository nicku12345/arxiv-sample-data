We show the dominance of the restriction map from a moduli space of stable sheaves on the projective plane to the Coble quartic. With the dominance and the interpretation of a stable sheaf on the plane in terms of the hyperplane arrangements, we expect to investigate the geometry of the Coble quartic.
