A curve, that is, a connected, reduced, projective scheme of dimension 1 over an algebraically closed field, admits two types of compactifications of its (generalized) Jacobian: the moduli schemes of P-quasistable torsion-free, rank-1 sheaves and Seshadri's moduli schemes of S-equivalence classes of semistable torsion-free, rank-1 sheaves. Both are constructed with respect to a choice of polarization. The former are fine moduli spaces which were shown to be complete; here we show that they are actually projective. The latter are just coarse moduli spaces. Here we give a sufficient condition for when these two types of moduli spaces are equal.
