In this article, we define the l-adic homology for a morphism of schemes satisfying certain finiteness conditions. This homology has these functors similar to the Chow groups: proper push-forward, flat pull-back, base change, cap-product, etc. In particular on singular varieties, this kind of l-adic homology behaves much better that the classical l-adic cohomology. As an application, we give an much easier approach to construct the cycle maps for arbitrary algebraic schemes over fields of finite cohomology dimension. And we prove these cycle maps kill the algebraic equivalences and commute with the Chern action of locally free sheaves.
