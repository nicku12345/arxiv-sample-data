Let R be an integral domain of finite type over Z and let f:X --> Spec R be a smooth projective morphism of relative dimension d >= 1. We investigate, for a vector bundle E on the total space X, under what arithmetical properties of a sequence (p_n, e_n)_{n \in \NN}, consisting of closed points p_n in Spec R and Frobenius descent data E_{p_n} \cong F^{e_n}^*(F) on the closed fibers X_{p_n}, the bundle E_0 on the generic fiber X_0 is semistable.
