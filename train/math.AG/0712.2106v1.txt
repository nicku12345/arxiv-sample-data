In this paper we study the Brill-Noether theory of sub-line bundles of a general, stable rank-two vector bundle on a curve C with general moduli. We relate this theory to the geometry of unisecant curves on smooth, non-special scrolls with hyperplane sections isomorphic to C. Most of our results are based on degeneration techniques.
