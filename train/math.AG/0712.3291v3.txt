We define, for a regular scheme S and a given field of characteristic zero \KK, the notion of \KK-linear mixed Weil cohomology on smooth S-schemes by a simple set of properties, mainly: Nisnevich descent, homotopy invariance, stability (which means that the cohomology of \GG_{m} behaves correctly), and K\"unneth formula. We prove that any mixed Weil cohomology defined on smooth S-schemes induces a symmetric monoidal realization of some suitable triangulated category of motives over S to the derived category of the field \KK. This implies a finiteness theorem and a Poincar\'e duality theorem for such a cohomology with respect to smooth and projective S-schemes (which can be extended to smooth S-schemes when S is the spectrum of a perfect field). This formalism also provides a convenient tool to understand the comparison of such cohomology theories. Our main examples are algebraic de Rham cohomology and rigid cohomology, and the Berthelot-Ogus isomorphism relating them.
