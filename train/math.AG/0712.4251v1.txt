The moduli stack of Deligne-Mumford stable curves of genus g admits a stratification, so that the number of nodes of the curves belonging to one stratum is constant. The irreducible components of the stratum corresponding to curves with exactly 3g-4 nodes are one-dimensional substacks. We show how they can be related to moduli stacks of (permutation classes of) pointed stable curves. Using this, we construct all components of this stratum in a new way as quotient stacks.
