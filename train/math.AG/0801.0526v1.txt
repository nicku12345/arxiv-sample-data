For a binary quartic form \phi without multiple factors, we classify the quartic K3 surfaces \phi(x,y)=\phi(z,t) whose Neron-Severi group is (rationally) generated by lines. For generic binary forms \phi, \psi of prime degree without multiple factors, we prove that the Neron-Severi group of the surface \phi(x,y)=\psi(z,t) is rationally generated by lines.
