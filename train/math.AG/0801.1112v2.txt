In this paper we study the minimal surfaces of general type with p_g=q=1 and K^2=4 whose Albanese general fibre has genus 2, classifying those such that the direct image (under the Albanese morphism) of the bicanonical sheaf is sum of line bundles. We find 8 unirational families, all of dimension strictly bigger than the expected one. These families are pairwise disjoint irreducible components of the moduli space of minimal surfaces of general type.
