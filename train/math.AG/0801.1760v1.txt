Our fundamental result is the construction of new subvarieties in the varieties of power sums for the Scorza quartic of any general pairs of trigonal curves and non-effective theta characteristics. This is a generalization of Mukai's description of smooth prime Fano threefolds of genus twelve as the varieties of power sums for plane quartics. Among other applications, we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Dolgachev and Kanev on the existence of the Scorza quartic for any general pairs of curves and non-effective theta characteristics.
