In the case of two-dimensional cyclic quotient singularities, we classify all one-parameter toric deformations in terms of certain Minkowski decompositions. In particular, we describe to which components each such deformation maps, show how to induce each deformation from a versal family, give explicit equations for each deformation, describe the singularities in the general fibers, and construct the corresponding partial simultaneous resolutions.
