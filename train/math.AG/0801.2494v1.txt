We study the Chow motive (with rational coefficients) of a hypersurface X in the projective space by using the variety F(X) of l-dimensional planes contained in X. If the degree of X is sufficiently small we show that the primitive part of the motive of X is the tensor product of a direct summand in the motive of a suitable complete intersection in F(X) and the l-th twist Q(-l) of the Lefschetz motive.
