We prove that the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves with proper support is equivalent to the category of locally-finite, cohomological functors on the perfect derived category of a quasi-projective scheme over a field. We introduce the notions of pseudo-adjoints and Rouquier functors and study them. As an application of these ideas and results, we extend the reconstruction result of Bondal and Orlov to Gorenstein projective varieties.
