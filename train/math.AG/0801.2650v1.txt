For two variable real analytic function germs we compare the blow-analytic equivalence in the sense of Kuo to the other natural equivalence relations. Our main theorem states that C^1 equivalent germs are blow-analytically equivalent. This gives a negative answer to a conjecture of Kuo. In the proof we show that the Puiseux pairs of real Newton-Puiseux roots are preserved by the C^1 equivalence of function germs. The proof is achieved, being based on a combinatorial characterisation of blow-analytic equivalence in terms of the real tree model.   We also give several examples of bi-Lipschitz equivalent germs that are not blow-analytically equivalent.
