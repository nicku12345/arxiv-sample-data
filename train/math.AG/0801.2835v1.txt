Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a finite field. Balasubramanian and Koblitz have proved that if the l-th roots of unity m_l is not contained in the ground field, then a field extension of the ground field contains m_l if and only if the l-torsion points of E are rational over the same field extension. We generalize this result to Jacobians of genus two curves. In particular, we show that the Weil- and the Tate-pairing are non-degenerate over the same field extension of the ground field.   From this generalization we get a complete description of the l-torsion subgroups of Jacobians of supersingular genus two curves. In particular, we show that for l>3, the l-torsion points are rational over a field extension of degree at most 24.
