This paper is a continuation of our earlier development of a theory of tame Artin stacks. Our main goal here is the construction of an appropriate analogue of Kontsevich's space of stable maps in the case where the target is a tame Artin stack. When the target is a tame Deligne--Mumford stack, the theory was developed by Abramovich and Vistoli, and found a number of applications. The theory for arbitrary tame Artin stacks developed here is very similar, but it is necessary to overcome a number of technical hurdles and to generalize a few questions of foundation.
