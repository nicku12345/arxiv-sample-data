In this paper we study K3 surfaces with a non-symplectic automorphism of order 3. In particular, we classify the topological structure of the fixed locus of such automorphisms and we show that it determines the action on cohomology. This allows us to describe the structure of the moduli space and to show that it has three irreducible components.
