We generalize the construction of the category of 1-motives with torsion {}^tM_1 (introduced by Barbieri-Viale, Rosenschon and Saito) as well as the construction of the category of 1-motivic sheaves {\rm Shv}_1 (defined by Barbieri-Viale and Kahn) to perfect fields k (without inverting the exponential characteristic). For k transcendental over the prime field we extend a result of Barbieri-Viale and Kahn, showing that {}^tM and {\rm Shv}_1 have equivalent bounded derived categories.
