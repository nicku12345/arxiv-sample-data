A rank one local system \LL on a smooth complex algebraic variety M is admissible roughly speaking if the dimension of the cohomology groups H^m(M,\LL) can be computed directly from the cohomology algebra H^*(M,\C).   We say that a line arrangement \A is of type \CC_k if k \ge 0  is the minimal number of lines in \A containing all the points of multiplicity at least 3. We show that if \A is a line arrangement in the classes \CC_k for k\leq 2, then any rank one local system \LL on the line arrangement complement M is admissible. Partial results are obtained for the class \CC_3.
