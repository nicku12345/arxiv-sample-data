Let A be an Azumaya algebra over a field. If G is the group of automorphisms of A and X denotes a projective homogeneous variety under G, we construct in a very explicit way and under suitable hypotheses a bundle \mathcal{V} on S, where S is a (generalized) Severi-Brauer variety associated to A, and a canonical isomorphism between X and a flag bundle on \mathcal{V}. This allows to explicitely compute Chow groups of X in terms of the Chow groups of S.
