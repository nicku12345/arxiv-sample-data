We present results indicating that the decomposition of a Ricci-flat manifold in its irreducible factors is reflected by the derived category of coherent sheaves. More precisely, we prove that a smooth projective variety that is derived equivalent to an abelian variety resp. an irreducible symplectic variety is of the same type.   The paper also contains a proof of a conjecure of Caldararu for manifolds with trivial canonical bundle saying that the modified HKR isomorphism for Hochschild homology is compatible with the module structure.
