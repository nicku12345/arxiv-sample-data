Let f_1,...,f_n be n germs of holomorphic functions at the origin of \mathbb{C}^n such that f_i(0)=0, 1\leq i\leq n. We give a proof based on the J. Lipman's theory of residues via Hochschild Homology that the Jacobian of f_1,...,f_n belongs to the ideal generated by f_1,...,f_n belongs to the ideal generated by f_1,...,f_n if and only if the dimension ot the germ of common zeos of f_1,...,f_n is sttrictly positive. In fact we prove much more general results which are relatives versions of this result replacing the field \mathbb{C} by convenient noetherian rings \mathbf{A} (c.f. Th. 3.1 and Th. 3.3). We then show a \L ojasiewicz inequality for the jacobian analogous to the classical one by S. \L ojasiewicz for the gradient.
