Hesse claimed that an irreducible projective hypersurface in \PP^n defined by an equation with vanishing hessian determinant is necessarily a cone. Gordan and Noether proved that this is true for n\leq 3 and constructed counterexamples for every n\geq 4. Gordan and Noether and Franchetta gave classification of hypersurfaces in \PP^4 with vanishing hessian and which are not cones. Here we translate in geometric terms Gordan and Noether approach, providing direct geometrical proofs of these results.
