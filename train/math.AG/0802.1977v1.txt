Given a morphism X \to S of log schemes of characteristic p > 0 and a lifting of X' over S modulo p^2, we use Lorenzon's indexed algebras A_X^{gp} and B_{X/S} to construct an equivalence between O_X-modules with nilpotent integrable connection and indexed B_{X/S}-modules with nilpotent B_{X/S}-linear Higgs field. If either satisfies a stricter nilpotence condition, we find an isomorphism between the de Rham cohomology of the connection and the Higgs cohomology of the Higgs field.
