The classification problem for K3-surfaces equipped with finite groups H of symplectic symmetry centralized by an antisymplectic involution is considered. An approach via equivariant Mori-reduction is employed. This method, which has proved to be successful even for rather small groups, is exemplified here by giving a complete classification in the case H = C_3 \ltimes C_7. The consideration of this particular group is related to the study of K3-surfaces with maximal finite groups of symplectic automorphisms. Applications to the case L_2(7) are given.
