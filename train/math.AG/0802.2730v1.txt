In this article we consider surfaces that are general with respect to a 3- dimensional toric idealistic cluster. In particular, this means that blowing up a toric constellation provides an embedded resolution of singularities for these surfaces. First we give a formula for the topological zeta function directly in terms of the cluster. Then we study the eigenvalues of monodromy. In particular, we derive a useful criterion to be an eigenvalue. In a third part we prove the monodromy and the holomorphy conjecture for these surfaces.
