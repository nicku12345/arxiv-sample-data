Recently, Prasad and Yeung classified all possible fundamental groups of fake projective planes. According to their result, many fake projective planes admit a nontrivial group of automorphisms, and in that case it is isomorphic to \bbZ/3\bbZ, \bbZ/7\bbZ, 7:3, or (\bbZ/3\bbZ)^2, where 7:3 is the unique non-abelian group of order 21.   Let G be a group of automorphisms of a fake projective plane X. In this paper we classify all possible structures of the quotient surface X/G and its minimal resolution.
