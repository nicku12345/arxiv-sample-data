We prove in the case of minimal Fano threefolds a conjecture stated by Dubrovin at the ICM 1998 in Berlin. The conjecture predicts that the symmetrized/alternated Euler characteristic pairing on K_0 of a Fano variety with an exceptional collection expressed in the basis of the classes of the exceptional objects coincides with the intersection pairing of the vanishing cycles in Dubrovin's second connection. We show that the conjecture holds for V_{22}, a minimal Fano threefold of anticanonical degree~22, and for V_5, the minimal Fano threefold of anticanonical degree~40, by applying the modularity result for rank 1 Fano threefolds. The truth of the conjecture for \P ^3 and the three--dimensional quadric is known; we consider these cases for the sake of completeness.
