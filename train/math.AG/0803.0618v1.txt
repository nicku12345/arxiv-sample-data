For any separated algebraic space X/S we construct a separated algebraic space \Gamma^d(X/S) -- the space of divided powers -- which parameterizes zero cycles of degree d on X. The space of divided powers for an affine scheme is given by the spectrum of the algebra of divided powers. In characteristic zero or when X/S is flat, the constructed space coincides with the symmetric product Sym^d(X/S). We also prove several fundamental results on the kernels of multiplicative polynomial laws necessary for the construction of \Gamma^d(X/S).
