For projective varieties with a certain class of 'mild' isolated singularities and for projective threefolds with arbitrary Gorenstein canonical singularities, we show that the stringy Hodge numbers satisfy the Hard Lefschetz property. This result fits nicely with a 6-dimensional counterexample of Mustata and Payne for the Hard Lefschetz property for stringy Hodge numbers in general. We also give such an example, ours is a hypersurface singularity.
