Let k be a perfect field of characteristic p>0, \mathcal{V} a complete discrete valuation ring with residue field k and field of fractions K of characteristic 0, and S a separated k-scheme of finite type. When S is smooth over k, we partially prove here a conjecture of Berthelot about the overconvergence of the higher direct images of the structure sheaf under a proper smooth morphism f:X\to S; when k is perfect and \mathcal{V} is tamely ramified such direct images are always convergent, not only for the structure sheaf but also for (almost) every convergent F-isocrystals. More generally, we prove this overconvergence when f is liftable over \mathcal{V}, or when X is a relative complete intersection in some projective spaces over S, and taking as coefficients any overconvergent isocrystals. We then apply these results to L-functions with coefficients such direct images with Frobenius structure: we derive rationality or meromorphy for these L-functions (Dwork's conjecture), and we study their p-adic unit zeroes and poles (Katz's conjecture) ; and explicit case concerns the ordinary abelian schemes. A more precise presentation of results by chapters is given in the introduction.
