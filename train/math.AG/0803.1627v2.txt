Let Y be an (m+1)-dimensional irreducible smooth complex projective variety embedded in a projective space. Let Z be a closed subscheme of Y, and \delta be a positive integer such that \mathcal I_{Z,Y}(\delta) is generated by global sections. Fix an integer d\geq \delta +1, and assume the general divisor X \in |H^0(Y,\ic_{Z,Y}(d))| is smooth. Denote by H^m(X;\mathbb Q)_{\perp Z}^{\text{van}} the quotient of H^m(X;\mathbb Q) by the cohomology of Y and also by the cycle classes of the irreducible components of dimension m of Z. In the present paper we prove that the monodromy representation on H^m(X;\mathbb Q)_{\perp Z}^{\text{van}} for the family of smooth divisors X \in |H^0(Y,\ic_{Z,Y}(d))| is irreducible.
