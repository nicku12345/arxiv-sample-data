We treat two different topics on the log minimal model program, especially for four-dimensional log canonical pairs. (a) Finite generation of the log canonical ring in dimension four. (b) Abundance theorem for irregular fourfolds. We obtain (a) as a direct consequence of the existence of four-dimensional log minimal models by using Fukuda's theorem on the four-dimensional log abundance conjecture. We can prove (b) only by using traditional arguments. More precisely, we prove the abundance conjecture for irregular (n+1)-folds on the assumption that the minimal model conjecture and the abundance conjecture hold in dimension \leq n.
