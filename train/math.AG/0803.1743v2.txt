Earlier the authors considered and, in some cases, computed Poincare series of two sorts of multi-index filtrations on the ring of germs of functions on a complex (normal) surface singularity (in particular on the complex plane). A filtration from the first class was defined by a curve (with several branches) on the surface singularity. The other one (so called divisorial filtration) was defined by a set of components of the exceptional divisor of a modification of the surface singularity. Here we define a filtration corresponding to an ideal or to a set of ideals in the ring of germs of functions on a surface singularity and compute the corresponding Poincare series in some cases. For the complex plane this notion unites the two classes of filtrations described above.
