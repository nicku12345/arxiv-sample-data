In this paper, we introduce new enumerative invariants of curves on Calabi-Yau 3-folds via certain stable objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves. We introduce the notion of limit stability on the category of perverse coherent sheaves, a subcategory in the derived category, and construct the moduli spaces of limit stable objects. We then define the counting invariants of limit stable objects using Behrend's constructible functions on that moduli spaces. It will turn out that our invariants are generalizations of counting invariants of stable pairs introduced by Pandharipande and Thomas. We will also investigate the wall-crossing phenomena of our invariants under change of stability conditions.
