We prove the Hausdorff property of the Neron modle of the family of intermediate Jacobians which is recently defined by Green, Griffiths and Kerr assuming that the divisor at infinity is smooth. Using their result, this implies in this case the analyticity of the closure of the zero locus of an admissible normal function. The last assertion is also obtained by Brosnan and Pearlstein generalizing their method in the curve case.
