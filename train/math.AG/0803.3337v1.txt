We give refined statements and modern proofs of Rosenlicht's results about the canonical model C' of an arbitrary complete integral curve C. Notably, we prove that C and C' are birationally equivalent if and only if C is nonhyperelliptic, and that, if C is nonhyperelliptic, then C' is equal to the blowup of C with respect to the canonical sheaf \omega. We also prove some new results: we determine just when C' is rational normal, arithmetically normal, projectively normal, and linearly normal.
