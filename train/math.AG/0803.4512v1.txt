We study the relative Hilbert scheme of a family of nodal (or smooth) curves, over a base of arbitrary dimension, via its (birational) cycle map, going to the relative symmetric product. We show the cycle map is the blowing up of the discriminant locus, which consists of cycles with multiple points. We work out the action of the blowup or 'discriminant' polarization on some natural cycles in the Hilbert scheme, including generalized diagonals and cycles, called 'node scrolls', parametrizing schemes supported on singular points. We derive an intersection calculus for Chern classes of tautological vector bundles, which are closely related to enumerative geometry.
