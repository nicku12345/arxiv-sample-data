Here we consider the product of varieties with n-blocks collections . We give some cohomological splitting conditions for rank 2 bundles. A cohomological characterization for vector bundles is also provided. The tools are Beilinson's type spectral sequences generalized by Costa and Mir\'o-Roig. Moreover we introduce a notion of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity on a product of finitely many projective spaces and smooth quadric hypersurfaces in order to prove two splitting criteria for vector bundle with arbitrary rank.
