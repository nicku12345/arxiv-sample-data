Desingularized fiber products of semi-stable, non-isotrivial jacobian elliptic surfaces with vanishing third Betti number are classified. Such varieties may play a role in the study of supersingular threefolds, of the deformation theory of varieties with trivial canonical bundle, and of the arithmetic degenerations of rigid Calabi-Yau threefolds.
