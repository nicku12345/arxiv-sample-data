Let S be a {\em Todorov surface}, {\it i.e.}, a minimal smooth surface of general type with q=0 and p_g=1 having an involution i such that S/i is birational to a K3 surface and such that the bicanonical map of S is composed with i.   The main result of this paper is that, if P is the minimal smooth model of S/i, then P is the minimal desingularization of a double cover of \mathbb P^2 ramified over two cubics. Furthermore it is also shown that, given a Todorov surface S, it is possible to construct Todorov surfaces S_j with K^2=1,...,K_S^2-1 and such that P is also the smooth minimal model of S_j/i_j, where i_j is the involution of S_j. Some examples are also given, namely an example different from the examples presented by Todorov in \cite{To2}.
