We define and study Gysin morphisms on mixed motives over a perfect field. Our construction extends the case of closed immersions, already known from results of Voevodsky, to arbitrary projective morphisms. We prove several classical formulas in this context, such as the projection and excess intersection formulas, and some more original ones involving residues. Finally, we give an application of this construction to duality and motive with compact support.
