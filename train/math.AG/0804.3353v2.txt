A non-classical Godeaux surface is a minimal surface of general type with \chi=K^2=1 but with h^{01}\neq0. We prove that such surfaces fulfill h^{01}=1 and they can exist only over fields of positive characteristic at most 5. Like non-classical Enriques surfaces they fall into two classes: the singular and the supersingular ones. We give a complete classification in characteristic 5 and compute their Hodge-, Hodge--Witt- and crystalline cohomology (including torsion). Finally, we give an example of a supersingular Godeaux surface in characteristic 5.
