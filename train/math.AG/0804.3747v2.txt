Let A be an abelian variety over {\bf C}_p (p a prime number) and V\hookrightarrow A a closed subvariety. The conjecture of Tate-Voloch predicts that the p-adic distance from a torsion point T\not\in V({\bf C}_p) to the variety V is bounded below by a strictly positive constant. This conjecture is proven by Hrushovski and Scanlon, when A has a model over \bar{{\bf C}}_p. We give an explicit formula for this constant, in the case where V is a curve embedded into its Jacobian and V has a model over a number field. This explicit formula involves analytic and arakelovian invariants of the curve.
