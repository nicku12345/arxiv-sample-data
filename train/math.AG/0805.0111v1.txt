The aim of this paper is to describe the geometry of the generic Kummer surface associated to a (1,2)-polarized abelian surface. We show that it is the double cover of a weak del Pezzo surface and that it inherits from the del Pezzo surface an elliptic fibration with twelve singular fibers of type I_2.
