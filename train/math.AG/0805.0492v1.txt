This article deals with the quotient category of the category of coherent sheaves on an irreducible smooth projective variety by the full subcategory of sheaves supported in codimension greater than c. It turns out that this category has homological dimension c. As an application of this, we will describe the space of stability conditions on its derived category in the case c=1. Moreover, we describe all exact equivalences between these quotient categories in this particular case which is closely related to classification problems in birational geometry.
