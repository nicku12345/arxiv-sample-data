The Picard scheme of a smooth curve and a smooth complex variety is reduced. In this note we discuss which classes of surfaces in terms of the Enriques-Kodaira classification can have non-reduced Picard schemes and whether there are restrictions on the characteristic of the ground field. It turns out that non-reduced Picard schemes are uncommon in Kodaira dimension \kappa\leq0, that this phenomenon can be bounded for \kappa=2 (general type) and that it is as bad as can be in \kappa=1.
