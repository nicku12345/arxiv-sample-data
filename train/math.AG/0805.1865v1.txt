We study an example of a Teichmueller curve in the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 2 coming from an origami S. It is particular in that its points admit the Klein four group as a subgroup of the automorphism group. We give an explicit description of its points in terms of affine plane curves, we show that the Teichmueller curve is a nonsingular, affine curve of genus 0 and we determine the number of cusps in the boundary of the moduli space.
