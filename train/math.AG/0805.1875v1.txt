The holomorphy conjecture predicts that the local Igusa zeta function associated to a hypersurface and a character is holomorphic on \mathbb{C} whenever the order of the character does not divide the order of any eigenvalue of the local monodromy of the hypersurface. In this note we propose the holomorphy conjecture for arbitrary subschemes at the level of the topological zeta function and we prove this conjecture for subschemes defined by an ideal that is generated by a finite number of complex polynomials in two variables.
