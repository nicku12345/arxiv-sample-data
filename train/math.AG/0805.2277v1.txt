We study the moduli spaces and compute the fundamental groups of plane sextics of torus type with the set of inner singularities 2\bold{A}_8 or \bold{A}_{17}. We also compute the fundamental groups of a number of other sextics, both of and not of torus type. The groups found are simplest possible, i.e., \Bbb{Z}_2*\Bbb{Z}_3 and \Bbb{Z}_6, respectively.
