We present algorithms for parametrizing by radicals an irreducible curve, not necessarily plane, when the genus is less o equal to 4 and they are defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In addition, we also present an algorithm for parametrizing by radicals any irreducible plane curve of degree d having at least a point of multiplicity d-r, with 1\leq r \leq 4 and, as a consequence, every irreducible plane curve of degree d \leq 5 and every irreducible singular plane curve of degree 6.
