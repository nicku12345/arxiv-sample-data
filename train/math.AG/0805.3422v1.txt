We study the second Gaussian map for a curve X of genus g, in relation with the second fundamental form of the period map. We exhibit a class of infinitely many curves with surjective second Gaussian map. We compute its rank on the hyperelliptic and trigonal locus and show global generation of its image for X not hyperelliptic nor trigonal.
