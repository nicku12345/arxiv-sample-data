We prove an analogue of Fujino and Mori's ``bounding the denominators'' in the log canonical bundle formula (see also Prokhorov and Shokurov) for Kawamata log terminal pairs of relative dimension one. As an application we prove that for a klt pair (X,\Delta) of Kodaira codimension one and dimension at most three such that the coefficients of \Delta are in a DCC set \mathcal{A}, there is a natural number N that depends only on \mathcal{A} for which the round down of \N(K_X+\Delta) induces the Iitaka fibration. We also prove a birational boundedness result for klt surfaces of general type.
