Let C be a curve over a non-singular base variety S. We study algebraic cycles on the symmetric powers C^[n] and on the Jacobian J. The Chow homology of C^[*], the sum of all C^[n], is a ring using the Pontryagin product. We prove that this ring is isomorphic to CH(J)[t]<u>, the PD-polynomial algebra (variable: u) over the usual polynomial ring (variable: t) over the Chow ring CH(J). We give two such isomorphisms that over a general base are different. Further we give some precise results on how CH(J) sits embedded in CH(C^[*]) and we give an explicit geometric description of how the derivations with regard to t and u act.   Our results give rise to a new grading on the Chow ring of the Jacobian. After tensoring with Q the associated descending filtration coincides with the one coming from Beauville's decomposition. The grading we obtain is in general different from Beauville's.   Finally we give a version of our main result for tautological classes, and we show how our methods give a very simple and geometric proof of some relations obtained by Herbaut and van der Geer-Kouvidakis.
