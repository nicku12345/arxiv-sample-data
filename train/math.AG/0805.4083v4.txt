We study a specific class of deformations of curve singularities: the case when the singular point splits to several ones, such that the total \delta invariant is preserved. These are also known as equi-normalizable or equi-generic deformations. We restrict primarily to the deformations of singularities with smooth branches.   A natural invariant of the singular type is introduced: the dual graph. It imposes severe restrictions on the possible collisions/deformations. And allows to prove some bounds on the variation of classical invariants in equi-normalizable families.   We consider in details deformations of ordinary multiple points, the deformations of a singularity into the collections of ordinary multiple points and deformations of the type x^p+y^{pk} into the collections of A_k's.
