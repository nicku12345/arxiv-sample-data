Let X be an irreducible smooth projective curve of genus g\ge3 defined over the complex numbers and let {\mathcal M}_\xi denote the moduli space of stable vector bundles on X of rank n and determinant \xi, where \xi is a fixed line bundle of degree d. If n and d have a common divisor, there is no universal vector bundle on X\times {\mathcal M}_\xi. We prove that there is a projective bundle on X\times {\mathcal M}_\xi with the property that its restriction to X\times\{E\} is isomorphic to P(E) for all E\in\mathcal{M}_\xi and that this bundle (called the projective Poincar\'e bundle) is stable with respect to any polarization; moreover its restriction to \{x\}\times\mathcal{M}_\xi is also stable for any x\in X. We prove also stability results for bundles induced from the projective Poincar\'e bundle by homomorphisms \text{PGL}(n)\to H for any reductive H. We show further that there is a projective Picard bundle on a certain open subset \mathcal{M}' of \mathcal{M}_\xi for any d>n(g-1) and that this bundle is also stable. We obtain new results on the stability of the Picard bundle even when n and d are coprime.
