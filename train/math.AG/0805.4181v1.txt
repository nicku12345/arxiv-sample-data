We obtain a sharp bound on the degree of a globally generated vector bundle over a reduced irreducible projective variety defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. As an application, we obtain a Del Pezzo-Bertini type theorem on varieties of minimal degree for subvarieties of Grassmannians.
