In this paper we characterize, in two different ways, the Newton polygons which are jacobian Newton polygons of a branch. These characterizations give in particular combinatorial criteria of irreducibility for complex series in two variables and necessary conditions which a complex curve has to satisfy in order to be the discriminant of a complex plane branch.
