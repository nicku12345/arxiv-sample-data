Let G denote a finite group and \pi: Z \to Y a Galois covering of smooth projective curves with Galois group G. For every subgroup H of G there is a canonical action of the corresponding Hecke algebra \mathbb{Q}[H \backslash G/H] on the Jacobian of the curve X = Z/H. To each rational irreducible representation \mathcal{W} of G we associate an idempotent in the Hecke algebra, which induces a correspondence of the curve X and thus an abelian subvariety P of the Jacobian JX. We give sufficient conditions on \mathcal{W}, H, and the action of G on Z, which imply P to be a Prym-Tyurin variety. We obtain many new families of Prym-Tyurin varieties of arbitrary exponent in this way.
