Given Prym-Tyurin varieties of exponent q with respect to a finite group G, a subgroup H and a set of rational irreducible representations of G satisfying some additional properties, we construct a Prym-Tyurin variety of exponent [G:H]q in a natural way. We study an example of this result, starting from the dihedral group \mathbf{D}_p for any odd prime p. This generalizes the construction of arXiv:math/0412103v2[math.AG] for p=3. Finally, we compute the isogeny decomposition of the Jacobian of the curve underlying the above mentioned example.
