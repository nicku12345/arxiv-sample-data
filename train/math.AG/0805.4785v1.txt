Let X_1, ..., X_m denote smooth projective curves of genus g_i \geq 2 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and let n denote any integer at least equal to 1+\max_{i=1}^m g_i. We show that the product JX_1 \times ... \times JX_m of the corresponding Jacobian varieties admits the structure of a Prym-Tyurin variety of exponent n^{m-1}. This exponent is considerably smaller than the exponent of the structure of a Prym-Tyurin variety known to exist for an arbitrary principally polarized abelian variety. Moreover it is given by explicit correspondences.
