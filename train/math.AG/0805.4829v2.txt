Simple boundary expressions for the k-th power of the cotangent line class on the moduli space of stable 1-pointed genus g curves are found for k >= 2g. The method is by virtual localization on the moduli space of maps to the projective line. As a consequence, nontrivial tautological classes in the kernel of the push-forward map associated to the irreducible boundary divisor of the moduli space of stable g+1 curves are constructed. The geometry of genus g+1 curves then provides universal equations in genus g Gromov-Witten theory. As an application, we prove all the Gromov-Witten identities conjectured recently by K. Liu and H. Xu.
