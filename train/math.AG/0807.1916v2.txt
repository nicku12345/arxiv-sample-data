We introduce a Lie algebra of initial terms of logarithmic vector fields along a hypersurface singularity. Extending the formal structure theorem in [GS06, Thm. 5.4], we show that the completely reducible part of its linear projection lifts formally to a linear Lie algebra of logarithmic vector fields. For quasihomogeneous singularities, we prove convergence of this linearization. We relate our construction to the work of Hauser and M"uller [M"ul86, HM89] on Levi subgroups of automorphism groups of singularities, which proves convergence even for algebraic singularities. Based on the initial Lie algebra, we introduce a notion of reductive hypersurface singularity and show that any reductive free divisor is linear. As an application, we describe a lower bound for the dimension of hypersurface singularities in terms of the semisimple part of their initial Lie algebra.
