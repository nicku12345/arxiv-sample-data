Following ideas of V. Batyrev, we prove an analogue of the Cone Theorem for the closed cone of nef curves: an enlargement of the cone of nef curves is the closure of the sum of a K_X-non-negative portion and countably many K_X-negative coextremal rays. An example shows that this enlargement is necessary. We also describe the relationship between K_X-negative faces of this cone and the possible outcomes of the minimal model program.
