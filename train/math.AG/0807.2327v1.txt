For a G-variety X with an open orbit, we define its boundary \partial X as the complement of the open orbit. The action sheaf S_X is the subsheaf of the tangent sheaf made of vector fields tangent to \partial X. We prove, for a large family of smooth spherical varieties, the vanishing of the cohomology groups H^i(X,S_X) for i>0, extending results of F. Bien and M. Brion.   We apply these results to study the local rigidity of the smooth projective varieties with Picard number one classified in a previous paper of the first author.
