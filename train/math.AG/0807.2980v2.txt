The dominant rational maps of finite degree from a fixed variety to varieties of general type, up to birational isomorphisms, form a finite set. This has been known as the Iitaka-Severi conjecture, and is nowdays an established result, in virtue of some recent advances in the theory of pluricanonical maps. We study the question of finding some effective estimate for the finite number of maps, and to this aim we provide some update and refinement of the classical treatment of the subject.
