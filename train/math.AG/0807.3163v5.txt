We give explicit formulas for the dimensions and the degrees of A-discriminant varieties introduced by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky. Our formulas can be applied also to the case where the A-discriminant varieties are higher-codimensional and their degrees are described by the geometry of the configurations A. Moreover combinatorial formulas for the Euler obstructions of general (not necessarily normal) toric varieties will be also given.
