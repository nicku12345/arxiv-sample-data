Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n and let H be an ample line bundle on X. Let M_{X,H}(r;c_1, ..., c_{s}) be the moduli space of H-stable vector bundles E on X of rank r and Chern classes c_i(E)=c_i for i=1, ..., s:=min\{r,n\}. We define the Brill-Noether filtration on M_{X,H}(r;c_1, ..., c_{s}) as W_{H}^{k}(r;c_1,..., c_{s})= \{E \in M_{X,H}(r;c_1, ..., c_{s}) | h^0(X,E) \geq k \} and we realize W_{H}^{k}(r;c_1,..., c_{s}) as the kth determinantal variety of a morphism of vector bundles on M_{X,H}(r;c_1, ..., c_{s}), provided H^i(E)=0 for i \geq 2 and E \in M_{X,H}(r;c_1, ..., c_{s}). We also compute the expected dimension of W_{H}^{k}(r;c_1,..., c_{s}). Very surprisingly we will see that the Brill-Noether stratification allow us to compare moduli spaces of vector bundles on Hirzebruch surfaces stables with respect to different polarizations. We will also study the Brill-Noether loci of the moduli space of instanton bundles and we will see that they have the expected dimension.
