In this paper, we introduce the notion of representation of Bol algebra. We prove an analogue of the classical Engel's theorem and the ex- tension of Ado-Iwasawa theorem for Bol Algebras. We study the category of representations of Bol algebras and show that it is a tensor category. In the case of regular representations of Bol algebras, we give a complete classification of them for all two-dimensional Bol algebras.
