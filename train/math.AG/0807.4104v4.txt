The aim of the present paper is on the one hand to produce examples supporting the conclusion of Y. Namikawa in Remark 2.8 of \cite{N} and improving considerations of Example 1.11 of the same paper. On the other hand, it is intended to give a geometric interpretation of the rigidity properties of some trees of exceptional rational curves, as observed by Namikawa, which can be obtained by factorizing small resolutions through nodal threefolds.
