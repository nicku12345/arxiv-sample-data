In this paper we study complete linear series on a hyperelliptic curve C of arithmetic genus g. Let A be the unique line bundle on C such that |A| is a g^1_2, and let \mathcal{L} be a line bundle on C of degree d. Then \mathcal{L} can be factorized as \mathcal{L} = A^m \otimes B where m is the largest integer satisfying H^0 (C,\mathcal{L} \otimes A^{-m}) \neq 0. Let b = {deg}(B). We say that \textit{the factorization type of} \mathcal{L} is (m,b). Our main results in this paper assert that (m,b) gives a precise answer for many natural questions about \mathcal{L}.
