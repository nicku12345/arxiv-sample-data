We analyze the expansions in terms of the approximate roots of a Weierstrass polynomial f defining a plane branch (C,0), in the light of the toric embedded resolution of the branch. This leads to the definition of a class of (non equisingular) deformations of a plane branch (C,0) supported on certain monomials in the approximate roots of f. As a consequence we find out a Kouchnirenko type formula for the Milnor number (C,0). Our results provide a geometrical approach to Abhyankar's straight line conditions and its consequences. As an application we give an equisingularity criterion for a family of plane curves to be equisingular to a plane branch and we express it algorithmically.
