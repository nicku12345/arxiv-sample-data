The goal of this article is to give an elementary proof of the double shuffle relations directly for the Goncharov and Manin motivic multiple zeta values. The shuffle relation is straightforward, but for the stuffle we use a modification of a method first introduced by P. Cartier for the purpose of proving stuffle for the real multiple zeta values via integrals and blow-up sequences.
