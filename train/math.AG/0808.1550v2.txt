We give a complete classification of del Pezzo surfaces with quotient singularities and Picard rank 1 which admit a Q-Gorenstein smoothing.   There are 14 infinite families of toric examples. The surfaces in each family correspond to solutions of a Markov-type equation. The remaining surfaces are obtained as deformations of the toric surfaces or belong to a finite list of sporadic surfaces.
