Let I be the ideal of relations between the leading terms of the polynomials defining an automorphism of K^n. In this paper, we prove the existence of a locally nilpotent derivation which preserves I. Moreover, if I is principal, i.e. I=(R), we compute an upper bound for \deg_2(R) for some degree function \deg_2 defined by the automorphism. As applications, we determine all the principal ideals of relations for automorphisms of K^3 and deduce two elementary proofs of the Jung-van der Kulk Theorem about the tameness of automorphisms of K^{2}.
