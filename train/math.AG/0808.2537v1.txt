We study the moduli space A_g of g-dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties in positive characteristic, and its variant A_I with Iwahori level structure. Both supersingular Ekedahl-Oort strata and supersingular Kottwitz-Rapoport strata are isomorphic to disjoint unions of Deligne-Lusztig varieties (see [Hoeve 2008] and [Goertz, Yu 2008], resp.). Here we compare these isomorphisms. We also give an explicit description of Kottwitz-Rapoport strata contained in the supersingular locus in the general parahoric case. Finally, we show that every Ekedahl-Oort stratum is isomorphic to a parahoric Kottwitz-Rapoport stratum.
