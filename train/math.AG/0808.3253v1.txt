This text is my thesis, defended in June 2007, in the status it was at this time. The most important results are contained in the article "Foncteur de Picard d'un champ alg\'ebrique" to appear in "Mathematische Annalen" (see the preprint arXiv:0711.4545). In the article, some results have been added, and some previous results have been strengthened. However, the proofs of the results contained in the appendix (concerning the smooth-\'etale cohomology on an algebraic stack) have been removed. The thesis is only put on the ArXiv to provide a more lasting reference than my webpage for these proofs.
