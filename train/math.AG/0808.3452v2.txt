There is an equation relating numbers of curves on F_0 satisfying incidence conditions and numbers of curves on F_2 satisfying incidence conditions. The purpose of this paper is to give a tropical proof of this equation in the case of rational curves. We use induction on the degree and two Kontsevich-type formulas for curves on F_0 and on F_2. The formula for F_2 was not known before and is proved using tropical geometry.
