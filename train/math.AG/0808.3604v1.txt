Consider a component of the Hilbert scheme whose general point corresponds to a degree d genus g smooth irreducible and nondegenerate curve in a projective variety X. We give lower bounds for the dimension of such a component when X is P^3, P^4 or a smooth quadric threefold in P^4 respectively. Those bounds make sense from the asymptotic viewpoint if we fix d and let g vary. Some examples are constructed using determinantal varieties to show the sharpness of the bounds for d and g in a certain range. The results can also be applied to study rigid curves.
