We give a complete proof of the so called 8n^2-inequality, a local inequality for the self-intersection of a movable linear system at an isolated centre of a non canonical singularity. The inequality was suggested and several times published by I.Cheltsov but some of his arguments are faulty. We explain the mistake and replace the faulty piece by a correct argument.
