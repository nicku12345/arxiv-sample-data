Let H be an ample line bundle on a non-singular projective surface X, and M(H) the coarse moduli scheme of rank-two H-semistable sheaves with fixed Chern classes on X. We show that if H changes and passes through walls to get closer to K_X, then M(H) undergoes natural flips with respect to canonical divisors. When X is minimal and its Kodaira dimension is positive, this sequence of flips terminates in M(H_X); H_X is an ample line bundle lying so closely to K_X that the canonical divisor of M(H_X) is nef. Remark that so-called Thaddeus-type flips somewhat differ from flips with respect to canonical divisors.
