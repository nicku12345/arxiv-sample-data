For a complex manifold X the ring of microdifferential operators \E_X acts on the microlocalization \mu hom(F,\O_X), for F in the derived category of sheaves on X. Kashiwara, Schapira, Ivorra, Waschkies proved, as a byproduct of their new microlocalization functor for ind-sheaves, \mu_X, that \mu hom(F,\O_X) can in fact be defined as an object of the derived category of \E_X-modules: this follows from the fact that \mu_X \O_X is concentrated in one degree. In this paper we prove that the tempered microlocalization also is an object of the derived category of \E_X-modules. Since we don't know whether the tempered version of \mu_X \O_X is concentrated in one degree, we introduce a method to build suitable resolutions for which the action of \E_X is realized in the category of complexes. We define a version of the de Rham algebra on the subanalytic site which is quasi-injective and we work in the category of dg-modules over this de Rham algebra instead of the derived category of sheaves.
