Updated version. Includes comments on the advances in the field from the Kyoto workshop on Resolution of Singularities in Positive Characteristic, December 2008.   The article surveys the theory of kangaroo points as they appear in the resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. They represent one of the main obstructions for transcribing the characteristic zero proof of resolution to positive characteristic. Kangaroo points are classified through the concept of oblique polynomials. The results of the article are used in Hironaka's recent program towards the resolution of singularities in positive characteristic.
