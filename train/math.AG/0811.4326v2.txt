We study semistable pairs on elliptic K3 surfaces with a section: we construct a family of moduli spaces of pairs, related by wall crossing phenomena, which can be studied to describe the birational correspondence between moduli spaces of sheaves of rank 2 and Hilbert schemes on the surface. In the 4-dimensional case, this can be used to get the isomorphism between the moduli space and the Hilbert scheme described by Friedman.
