This paper contains a proof of a conjecture of Braverman concerning Laumon quasiflag spaces. We consider the generating function Z(m), whose coefficients are the integrals of the equivariant Chern polynomial (with variable m) of the tangent bundles of the Laumon spaces. We prove Braverman's conjecture, which states that Z(m) coincides with the eigenfunction of the Calogero-Sutherland hamiltonian, up to a simple factor which we specify. This conjecture was inspired by the work of Nekrasov in the affine \hat{sl}_n setting, where a similar conjecture is still open.
