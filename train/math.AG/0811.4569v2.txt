By Hironaka Desingularization Theorem, any real analytic function has only normal crossing singularities after a suitable modification. We focus on the analytic equivalence of such functions with only normal crossing singularities. We prove that for such functions C^{\infty} right equivalence implies analytic equivalence. We prove moreover that the cardinality of the set of equivalence classes is zero or countable.
