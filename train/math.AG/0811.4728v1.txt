In this note we give a brief review of the construction of a toric variety \mathcal{V} coming from a genus g \geq 2 Riemann surface \Sigma^g equipped with a trinion, or pair of pants, decomposition. This was outlined by J. Hurtubise and L. C. Jeffrey in \cite{JH1}. In \cite{T1} A. Tyurin used this construction on a certain collection of trinion decomposed surfaces to produce a variety DM_g -- the so-called Delzant model of moduli space -- for each genus g. We conclude this note with some basic facts about the moment polytopes of the varieties \mathcal{V}. In particular, we show that the varieties DM_g constructed by Tyurin, and claimed to be smooth, are in fact singular for g \geq 3.
