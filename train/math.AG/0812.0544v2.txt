A relatively fast algorithm for evaluating Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of complex algebraic curves is proposed. On the basis of numerical data, a conjectural large genus asymptotics of the Weil-Petersson volumes is computed. Asymptotic formulas for the intersection numbers involving \psi-classes are conjectured as well. The accuracy of the formulas is high enough to believe that they are exact.
