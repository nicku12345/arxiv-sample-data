We introduce and study the GIT CONE of \bar{M}_{0,n}, which is generated by the pullbacks of the natural ample line bundles on the GIT quotients (\mathbb P^1)^n//SL(2). We give an explicit formula for these line bundles and prove a number of basic results about the GIT cone.   As one application, we prove unconditionally that the log canonical models of \bar{M}_{0,n} with a symmetric boundary divisor coincide with the moduli spaces of weighted curves or with the symmetric GIT quotient, extending the result of Matt Simpson arXiv:0709.4037. (Cf. also a different proof by Fedorchuk and Smyth arXiv:0810.1677)
