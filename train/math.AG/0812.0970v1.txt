Let X be a symplectic or odd orthogonal Grassmannian which parametrizes isotropic subspaces in a vector space equipped with a nondegenerate (skew) symmetric form. We prove quantum Giambelli formulas which express an arbitrary Schubert class in the small quantum cohomology ring of X as a polynomial in certain special Schubert classes, extending the cohomological Giambelli formulas of arXiv:0811.2781.
