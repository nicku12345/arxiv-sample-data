The dimension of spaces of global sections for line bundles on semistable curves parametrized by the compactified Picard scheme is studied. The theorem of Riemann is shown to hold. The theorem of Clifford is shown to hold in the following cases: the curve has two components; the curve is any semistable curve and the degree is either 0 or 2g-2; the curve is stable, free from separating nodes, and the degree is at most 4. These results are all shown to be sharp. Applications to the Clifford index, to the combinatorial description of hyperelliptic curves, and to plane quintics are given.
