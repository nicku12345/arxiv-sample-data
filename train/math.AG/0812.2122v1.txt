Consider a partial flag variety X which is not a grassmaninan. Consider also its cohomology ring {\rm H}^*(X,\ZZ) endowed with the base formed by the Poincar\'e dual classes of the Schubert varieties. In \cite{Richmond:recursion}, E. Richmond showed that some coefficient structure of the product in {\rm H}^*(X,\ZZ) are products of two such coefficients for smaller flag varieties. Consider now a quiver without oriented cycle. If \alpha and \beta denote two dimension-vectors, \alpha\circ\beta denotes the number of \alpha-dimensional subrepresentations of a general \alpha+\beta-dimensional representation. In \cite{DW:comb}, H. Derksen and J. Weyman expressed some numbers \alpha\circ\beta as products of two smaller such numbers. The aim of this work is to prove two generalisations of the two above results by the same way.
