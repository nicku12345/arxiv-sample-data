In this paper, we study double structures supported on rational normal curves. After recalling the general construction of double structures supported on a smooth curve described in \cite{fer}, we specialize it to double structures on rational normal curves. To every double structure we associate a triple of integers  (2r,g,n)  where  r  is the degree of the support,  n \geq r  is the dimension of the projective space containing the double curve, and  g  is the arithmetic genus of the double curve. We compute also some numerical invariants of the constructed curves, and we show that the family of double structures with a given triple  (2r,g,n)  is irreducible. Furthermore, we prove that the general double curve in the families associated to  (2r,r+1,r)  and  (2r,1,2r-1)  is arithmetically Gorenstein. Finally, we prove that the closure of the locus containing double conics of genus  g \leq -2  form an irreducible component of the corresponding Hilbert scheme, and that the general double conic is a smooth point of that component. Moreover, we prove that the general double conic in  \mathbb{P}^3  of arbitrary genus is a smooth point of the corresponding Hilbert scheme.
