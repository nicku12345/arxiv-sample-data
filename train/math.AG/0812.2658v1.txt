We consider a complete nonsingular variety X over \bC, having a normal crossing divisor D such that the associated logarithmic tangent bundle is generated by its global sections. We show that H^i\big(X, L^{-1} \otimes \Omega_X^j(\log D)\big) = 0 for any nef line bundle L on X and all i < j - c, where c is an explicit function of (X,D,L). This implies e.g. the vanishing of H^i(X, L \otimes \Omega_X^j) for L ample and i > j, and gives back a vanishing theorem of Broer when X is a flag variety.
