This paper was inspired by work by T. Peternell, M. Schneider and A.J. Sommese on the Kodaira dimension of subvarieties. In it I find a relation between the Kodaira-Iitaka dimension of a divisor on a normal variety and that of related divisors on an irreducible normal subvariety of codimension one. The main result may be stated in a simplified form as: For X a complete normal variety, Y \sub X an irreducible complete normal divisor and \sL an invertible sheaf on X, there exist integers n_1 > 0, n_2 \geq 0 for which \kappa(X,\sL) - 1 \leq \kappa(Y,\sL^{n_1}(-n_2Y)|_Y), where, if Y is not a fixed component of large tensor powers of \sL, we may take n_1 >> n_2. This has implications for Kodaira-Iitaka dimension on a subvariety of any codimension.
