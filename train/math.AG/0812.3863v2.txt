We study birational geometry of Fano varieties, realized as double covers \sigma\colon V\to {\mathbb P}^M, M\geq 5, branched over generic hypersurfaces W=W_{2(M-1)} of degree 2(M-1). We prove that the only structures of a rationally connected fiber space on V are the pencils-subsystems of the free linear system |-\frac12 K_V|. The groups of birational and biregular self-maps of the variety V coincide.
