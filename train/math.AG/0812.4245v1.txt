Polar varieties have in recent years been used by Bank, Giusti, Heintz, Mbakop, and Pardo, and by Safey El Din and Schost, to find efficient procedures for determining points on all real components of a given non-singular algebraic variety. In this note we review the classical notion of polars and polar varieties, as well as the construction of what we here call reciprocal polar varieties. In particular we consider the case of real affine plane curves, and we give conditions for when the polar varieties of singular curves contain points on all real components.
