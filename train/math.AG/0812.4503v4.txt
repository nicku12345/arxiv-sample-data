We prove two existing conjectures which describe the geometrical McKay correspondence for a finite abelian G in SL3(C) such that C^3/G has a single isolated singularity. We do it by studying the relation between the derived category mechanics of computing a certain Fourier-Mukai transform and a piece of toric combinatorics known as `Reid's recipe', effectively providing a categorification of the latter.
