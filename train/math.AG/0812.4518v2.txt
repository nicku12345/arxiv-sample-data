We prove that if a K3 surface X admits \Z/5\Z as group of symplectic automorphisms, then it actually admits \Dh_5 as group of symplectic automorphisms. The orthogonal complement to the \Dh_5-invariants in the second cohomology group of X is a rank 16 lattice, L. It is known that L does not depend on X: we prove that it is isometric to a lattice recently described by R. L. Griess Jr. and C. H. Lam. We also give an elementary construction of L.
