The well-known Bernstein-Kushnirenko theorem from the theory of Newton polyhedra relates algebraic geometry and the theory of mixed volumes. Recently the authors have found a far-reaching generalization of this theorem to generic systems of algebraic equations on any quasi-projective variety. In the present note we review these results and their applications to algebraic geometry and convex geometry.
