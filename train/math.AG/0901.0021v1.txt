Fix integers g\geq 3 and r\geq 2, with r\geq 3 if g=3. Given a compact connected Riemann surface X of genus g, let \MDH(X) denote the corresponding \text{SL}(r, {\mathbb C}) Deligne--Hitchin moduli space. We prove that the complex analytic space \MDH(X) determines (up to an isomorphism) the unordered pair \{X, \overline{X}\}, where \overline{X} is the Riemann surface defined by the opposite almost complex structure on X.
