It is well known that an irreducible algebraic curve is rational (i.e. parametric) if and only if its genus is zero. In this paper, given a tolerance \epsilon>0 and an \epsilon-irreducible algebraic affine plane curve \mathcal C of proper degree d, we introduce the notion of \epsilon-rationality, and we provide an algorithm to parametrize approximately affine \epsilon-rational plane curves, without exact singularities at infinity, by means of linear systems of (d-2)-degree curves. The algorithm outputs a rational parametrization of a rational curve \bar{\mathcal C} of degree at most d which has the same points at infinity as \mathcal C. Moreover, although we do not provide a theoretical analysis, our empirical analysis shows that \bar{\mathcal C} and \mathcal C are close in practice.
