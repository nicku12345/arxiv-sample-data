We study Cox rings of K3-surfaces. A first result is that a K3-surface has a finitely generated Cox ring if and only if its effective cone is polyhedral. Moreover, we investigate degrees of generators and relations for Cox rings of K3-surfaces of Picard number two, and explicitly compute the Cox rings of generic K3-surfaces with a non-symplectic involution that have Picard number 2 to 5 or occur as double covers of del Pezzo surfaces.
