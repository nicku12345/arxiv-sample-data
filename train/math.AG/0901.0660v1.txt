We describe the standard and Leray filtrations on the cohomology groups with compact supports of a quasi projective variety with coefficients in a constructible complex using flags of hyperplane sections on a partial compactification of a related variety. One of the key ingredients of the proof is the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for perverse sheaves and, in an appendix, we discuss the base change maps for constructible sheaves on algebraic varieties and their role in a proof, due to Beilinson, of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.
