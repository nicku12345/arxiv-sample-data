We study a trace formula for tamely ramified abelian varieties A over a complete discretely valued field, which expresses the Euler characteristic of the special fiber of the N\'eron model of A in terms of the Galois action on the \ell-adic cohomology of A. If A has purely additive reduction, the trace formula yields a cohomological interpretation for the number of connected components of the special fiber of the N\'eron model.
