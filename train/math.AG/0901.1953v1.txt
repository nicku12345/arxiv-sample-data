In order to describe the asymptotic behaviour of a vanishing period in a one parameter family we introduce and use a very simple algebraic structure : regular geometric (a,b)-modules generated (as left \A-modules) by one element. The idea is to use not the full Brieskorn module associated to the Gauss-Manin connection but a minimal (regular) differential equation satisfied by the period integral we are interested in. We show that the Bernstein polynomial associated is quite simple to compute for such (a,b)-modules and give a precise description of the exponents which appears in the asymptotic expansion which avoids integral shifts. We show a couple of explicit computations in some classical (but not so easy) examples.
