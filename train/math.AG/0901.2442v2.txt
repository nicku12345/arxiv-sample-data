On June 5, 2007 the second author delivered a talk at the Journees de l'Institut Elie Cartan entitled "Finite symmetry groups in complex geometry". This paper begins with an expanded version of that talk which, in the spirit of the Journees, is intended for a wide audience. The later paragraphs are devoted both to the exposition of basic methods, in particular an equivariant minimal model program for surfaces, as well as an outline of recent work of the authors on the classification of K3-surfaces with special symmetry.
