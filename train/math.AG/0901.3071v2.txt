We study the spaces of stable real and quaternionic vector bundles on a real algebraic curve. The basic relationship is established with unitary representations of an extension Z/2 by the fundamental group. By comparison with the space of real or quaternionic connections, some of the basic topological invariants of these spaces are calculated.
