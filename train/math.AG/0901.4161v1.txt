We consider all complex projective manifolds X that satisfy at least one of the following three conditions:   1. There exists a pair (C ,\varphi), where C is a compact connected Riemann surface and \varphi : C\to X a holomorphic map, such that the pull back \varphi^*TX is not semistable.   2. The variety X admits an \'etale covering by an abelian variety.   3. The dimension \dim X \leq 1.   We conjecture that all complex projective manifolds are of the above type, and prove that the following classes are among those that are of the above type. i) All X with a finite fundamental group. ii) All X such that there is a nonconstant morphism from the projective line to X. iii) All X such that the canonical line bundle K_X is either positive or negative or c_1(K_X) \in H^2(X, {\mathbb Q}) vanishes. iv) All projective surfaces.
