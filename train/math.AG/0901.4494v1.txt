It is well known that a smooth projective Fano variety is rationally connected. Recently Zhang (and later Hacon and McKernan as a special case of their work on the Shokurov RC-conjecture) proved that the same conclusion holds for a klt pair (X,\D) such that -(K_X+\D) is big and nef. We prove here a natural generalization of the above result by dropping the nefness assumption. Namely we show that a klt pair (X,\D) such that -(K_X+\D) is big is rationally connected modulo the non-nef locus of -(K_X+\D). This result is a consequence of a more general structure theorem for arbitrary pairs (X,\D) with -(K_X+\D) pseff.
