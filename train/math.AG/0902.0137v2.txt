Let G be an affine algebraic group and let X be an affine algebraic variety. An action G\times X \to X is called observable if for any G-invariant, proper, closed subset Y of X there is a nonzero invariant f\in K[X]^G such that f(Y) =0. We characterize this condition geometrically as follows. The action G\times X \to X is observable if and only if (1) there is a nonempty open subset U\subseteq X consisting of closed orbits, and (2) the field K(X)^G of G-invariant rational functions on X is equal to the quotient field of K[X]^G. In case G is reductive, we conclude that there exists a unique, maximal, G-stable, closed subset X_{\soc} of X such that G\times X_{\soc} \to X_{\soc} is observable. Furthermore, the canonical map X_{\soc}// G \to X//G is finite and bijective.
