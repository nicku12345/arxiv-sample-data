We define and study a gluing procedure for Bridgeland stability conditions in the situation when a triangulated category has a semiorthogonal decomposition. As an application we construct stability conditions on the derived categories of {\mathbb{Z}}_2-equivariant sheaves associated with ramified double coverings of {\mathbb{P}}^3. Also, we study the stability space for the derived category of {\mathbb{Z}}_2-equivariant coherent sheaves on a smooth curve X, associated with a degree 2 map X\to Y, where Y is another smooth curve. In the case when the genus of Y is \geq 1 we give a complete description of the stability space.
