We define and construct the real analytic moduli stack of pluriharmonic bundles on a compact Kaehler manifold X, and show how this is equipped with Hodge and quaternionic structures. This stack maps to the de Rham moduli stack, giving rise to preferred sections of the Deligne-Hitchin twistor stack. We then show how the non-abelian mixed Hodge structures on Malcev homotopy types X can be extended to objects over the pluriharmonic moduli stack.
