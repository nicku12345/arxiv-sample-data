We consider fibrations of genus 2 over complex surfaces. The purpose of this paper is primarily to provide a geometric description of the possible structures of the fibration on a neighborhood of a singular fiber. In particular it is shown that the "geometric data" of the singular fiber determines the fibration on its neighborhood up to a transversely holomorphic C^{\infty}-diffeomorphism. The method employed is quite flexible and it applies to good extent to fibrations of arbitrary genus.
