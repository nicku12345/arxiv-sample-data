In this paper, we determine the stable base locus decomposition of the Kontsevich moduli spaces of degree two and three stable maps to Grassmannians. This gives new examples of the decomposition for varieties with Picard rank three. We also discuss the birational models that correspond to the chambers in the decomposition.
