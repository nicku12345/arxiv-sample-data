We construct explicit geometric models for and compute the fundamental groups of all plane sextics with simple singularities only and with at least one type \bold E_8 singular point. In particular, we discover four new sextics with nonabelian fundamental groups; two of them are irreducible. The groups of the two irreducible sextics found are finite. The principal tool used is the reduction to trigonal curves and Grothendieck's {\it dessins d'enfants}
