Given a big divisor D on a normal complex projective variety X, we show that the restricted volume of D along a very general complete-intersection curve C\subset X can be read off from the Okounkov body of D with respect to an admissible flag containing C. From this we deduce that if two big divisors D_1 and D_2 on X have the same Okounkov body with respect to every admissible flag, then D_1 and D_2 are numerically equivalent.
