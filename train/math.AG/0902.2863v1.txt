In this paper we explore the connection between Seshadri constants and the generation of jets. It is well-known that one way to view Seshadri constants is to consider them as measuring the rate of growth of the number of jets that multiples of a line bundle generate. Here we ask, conversely, what we can say about the number of jets once the Seshadri constant is known. As an application of our results, we prove a characterization of projective space among all Fano varieties in terms of Seshadri constants.
