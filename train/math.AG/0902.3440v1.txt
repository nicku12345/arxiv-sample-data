Working over a field \kk of characteristic zero, this paper studies line embeddings of the form \phi = (T_i,T_j,T_k):\A^1\to\A^3, where T_n denotes the degree n Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. In {\it Section 4}, it is shown that (1) \phi is an embedding if and only if the pairwise greatest common divisor of i,j,k is 1, and (2) for a fixed pair i,j of relatively prime positive integers, the embeddings of the form (T_i,T_j,T_k) represent a finite number of algebraic equivalence classes. {\it Section 2} gives an algebraic definition of the Chebyshev polynomials, where their basic identities are established, and {\it Section 3} studies the plane curves (T_i,T_j). {\it Section 5} establishes the Parity Property for Nodal Curves, and uses this to parametrize the family of alternating (i,j)-knots over the real numbers.
