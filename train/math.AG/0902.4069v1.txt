We study surfaces of general type S whose cotangent sheaf is generated by its global sections. We define a map called the cotangent map of S that enables us to understand the obstructions to the ampleness of the cotangent sheaf of S. These obstructions are curves on S that we call "non-ample". We classify surfaces with an infinite number of non-ample curves and we partly classify the non-ample curves.
