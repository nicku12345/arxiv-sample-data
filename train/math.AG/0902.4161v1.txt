Let C be a curve of genus g\geqslant 2 defined over the fraction field K of a complete discrete valuation ring R with algebraically closed residue field. Suppose that \char(K)=0 and that the characteristic of the residue field is not 2. Suppose that the Jacobian \Jac(C) has semi-stable reduction over R. Embed C in \Jac(C) using a K-rational point.   We show that the coordinates of the torsion points lying on C lie in the unique moderately ramified quadratic extension of the field generated over K by the coordinates of the p-torsion points on \Jac(C).
