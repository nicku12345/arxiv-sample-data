In this paper, we explore a notion of nonabelian Hodge structure on the fundamental group of an algebraic variety. This is approach is compared to some alternative approaches due to Morgan, Hain and others. We also give criteria for a variety to be a Hodge theoretic K(pi,1), which roughly means that the cohomology of variations of mixed Hodge structure can be determined from the group.
