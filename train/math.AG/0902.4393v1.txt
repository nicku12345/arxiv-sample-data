We give a bound on embedding dimensions of geometric generic fibers in terms of the dimension of the base, for fibrations in positive characteristic. This generalizes the well-known fact that for fibrations over curves, the geometric generic fiber is reduced. We illustrate our results with Fermat hypersurfaces and genus one curves.
