We suggest to endow Mumford's GIT quotient scheme with a stack structure, by replacing Proj(-) of the invariant ring with its stack theoretic analogue. We analyse the stacks resulting in this way from classically studied invariant rings, and in particular for binary forms of low degree. Our viewpoint is that the stack structure carries interesting geometric information that is intrinsically present in the invariant ring, but lost when passing to its Proj(-).
