Suppose S is an affine, noetherian scheme, X is a separated, noetherian S-scheme, \mathcal{E} is a coherent {\mathcal{O}}_{X}-bimodule and \mathcal{I} \subset T(\mathcal{E}) is a graded ideal. We study the geometry of the functor \Gamma_{n} of flat families of truncated \mathcal{B}=T(\mathcal{E})/\mathcal{I}-point modules of length n+1. We then use the results of our study to show that the point modules over \mathcal{B} are parameterized by the closed points of {\mathbb{P}}_{X^{2}}(\mathcal{E}). When X={\mathbb{P}}^{1}, we construct, for any \mathcal{B}-point module, a graded {\mathcal{O}}_{X}-\mathcal{B}-bimodule resolution.
