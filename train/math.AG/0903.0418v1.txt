We introduce an approach of Riemann--Roch theorem to the boundedness problem of minimal log discrepancies in fixed dimension. After reducing it to the case of a Gorenstein terminal singularity, firstly we prove that its minimal log discrepancy is bounded if either multiplicity or embedding dimension is bounded. Secondly we recover the characterisation of a Gorenstein terminal three-fold singularity by Reid, and the precise boundary of its minimal log discrepancy by Markushevich, without explicit classification. Finally we provide the precise boundary for a special four-fold singularity, whose general hyperplane section has a terminal piece.
