In math.AG/0207233, Okounkov and Pandharipande gave an operator formalism for computing the equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of the projective line. This thesis extends their result to orbifold lines. In the effective case the theory is again governed by the 2-Toda hierarchy. In the ineffective case the decomposition conjecture of hep-th/0606034 is verified.
