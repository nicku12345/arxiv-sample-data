Let G be a connected reductive subgroup of a complex connected reductive group \hat{G}. Fix maximal tori and Borel subgroups of G and \hat{G}. Consider the cone LR^\circ(\hat{G},G) generated by the pairs (\nu,\hat{\nu}) of strictly dominant characters such that V_\nu is a submodule of V_{\hat\nu}. The main result of this article is a bijective parametrisation of the faces of LR^\circ(\hat G,G). We also explain when such a face is contained in another one. In way, we obtain results about the faces of the Dolgachev-Hu's G-ample cone. We also apply our results to reprove known results about the moment polytopes.
