This paper constructs cospecialization homomorphisms between the (p') versions of the tempered fundamental group of the fibers of a smooth morphism with polystable reduction (the tempered fundamental group is a sort of analog of the topological fundamental group of complex algebraic varieties in the p-adic world). We studied the question for families of curves in another paper. To construct them, we will start by describing the pro-(p') tempered fundamental group of a smooth and proper variety with polystable reduction in terms of the reduction endowed with its log structure, thus defining tempered fundamental groups for log polystable varieties.
