We construct monads for framed torsion-free sheaves on blow-ups of the complex projective plane at finitely many distinct points. Using these monads we prove that the moduli space of such sheaves is a smooth algebraic variety. Moreover we construct monads for families of such sheaves parameterized by a noetherian scheme S of finite type. A universal monad on the moduli space is introduced and used to prove that the moduli space is fine.
