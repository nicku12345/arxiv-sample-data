We relate Fubini's theorem for Euler characteristics to Riemann-Hurwtiz formulae, and reprove a classical result of Iversen. The techniques used include algebraic geometry, complex geometry, and model theory. Possible applications to the study of wild ramification in finite characteristic are discussed.
