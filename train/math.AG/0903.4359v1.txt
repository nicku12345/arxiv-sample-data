We compute the deformations in the sense of generalized complex structures of the standard classical complex structure on a primary Kodaira surface and we prove that the obtained family of deformations is a smooth locally complete family depending on four complex parameters. This family is the same as the extended deformations (in the sense of Kontsevich and Barannikov) in degree two, obtained by Poon using differential Gerstenhaber algebras.
