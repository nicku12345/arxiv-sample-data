We study the GIT quotients for the diagonal action of the algebraic group SL_3(\mathbb{C}) on the n-fold product of \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C}): in particular we determine a strategy in order to determine the (intersection) Poincar\'{e} polynomial of any quotient variety. In the special case n=6 we determine an explicit formula for the (intersection) Betti numbers of a quotient variety, depending only on the combinatorics of the weights of the polarization m\in \mathbb{Z}^6_{>0}.
