Let SU_C(2) be the moduli space of rank 2 semistable vector bundles with trivial de terminant on a smooth complex algebraic curve C of genus g > 1, we assume C non-hyperellptic if g > 2. In this paper we construct large families of pointed rational normal curves over certain linear sections of SU_C(2). This allows us to give an interpretation of these subvarieties of SUC(2) in terms of the moduli space of curves M_{0,2g}. In fact, there exists a natural linear map SU_C(2) -> P^g with modular meaning, whose fibers are birational to M_{0,2g}, the moduli space of 2g-pointed genus zero curves. If g < 4, these modular fibers are even isomorphic to the GIT compactification M^{GIT}_{0,2g}. The families of pointed rational normal curves are recovered as the fibers of the maps that classify extensions of line bundles associated to some effective divisors.
