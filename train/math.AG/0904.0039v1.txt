Recently, the first Abel map for a stable curve of genus g>1 has been constructed. Fix an integer d>0 and let C be a stable curve of compact type of genus g>1. We construct two d-th Abel maps for C, having different targets, and we compare the fibers of the two maps. As an application, we get a characterization of hyperelliptic stable curves of compact type with two components via the 2-nd Abel map.
