Four-folds with trivial canonical bundles are divided into six classes according to their holonomy group. We consider examples that are fibred by abelian surfaces over the projective plane. We construct such fibrations in five of the six classes, and prove that there is no such fibration in the sixth class. We classify all such fibrations whose generic fibre is the Jacobian of a genus two curve.
