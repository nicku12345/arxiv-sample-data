We describe methods for calculation of polytopes of quasiadjunction for plane curve singularities which are invariants giving a Hodge theoretical refinement of the zero sets of multivariable Alexander polynomials. In particular we identify some hyperplanes on which all polynomials in multivariable Bernstein ideal vanish.
