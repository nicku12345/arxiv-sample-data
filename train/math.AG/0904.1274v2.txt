We study stable rank 2 vector bundles with trivial determinant whose Frobenius pull back is non stable over a general curve of genus g>1. In genus 2, we apply recent results about the theta divisor associated to the bundle B of locally exact differential forms and we derive a scheme-theoretic description of the Frobenius inverse image of the semi-stable boundary of the moduli space.
