An isotrivially fibred surface is a smooth projective surface endowed with a morphism onto a curve such that all the smooth fibres are isomorphic to each other. The first goal of this paper is to classify the isotrivially fibred surfaces with p_g=q=2 completing and extending a result of Zucconi. As an important byproduct, we provide new examples of minimal surfaces of general type with p_g=q=2 and K^2=4,5 and a first example with K^2=6.
