We present some (unfortunately not all) known properties on the Cremona group; when it's possible we mentioned links with the most known group of polynomial automorphisms of the affine plane. The mentioned properties are essentially algebraic properties: generators, relations, finite subgroups, subgroups of finite type, automorphisms of the Cremona group, Tits alternative... but also dynamical properties: classification of birational maps, centralizer, dynamic of an Heisenberg subgroup... We deal with the construction of entropic automorphisms on rational surfaces.
