Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus g\geq 2 over the complex numbers. Fix n\geq 2, and an integer d. A pair (E,\phi) over X consists of an algebraic vector bundle E of rank n and degree d over X and a section \phi. There is a concept of stability for pairs which depends on a real parameter \tau. Let M_\tau(n,d) be the moduli space of \tau-semistable pairs of rank n and degree d over X. We prove that the cohomology groups of M_\tau(n,d) are Hodge structures isomorphic to direct summands of tensor products of the Hodge structure H^1(X). This implies a similar result for the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles over X.
