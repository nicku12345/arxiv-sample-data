Patchworking theorems serve as a basic element of the correspondence between tropical and algebraic curves, which is a core of the tropical enumerative geometry. We present a new version of a patchworking theorem which relates plane tropical curves with complex and real algebraic curves having prescribed multiple points. It can be used to compute Welschinger invariants of non-toric Del Pezzo surfaces.
