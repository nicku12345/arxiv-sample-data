This is the sequel to arXiv:math/0001089. In this paper, we complete the promised description of moduli of abelian surfaces of low degree, covering the cases of degree (1,12), (1,14), (1,16), (1,18) and (1,20). In each case, we describe birational models for the moduli space of abelian surfaces with polarization of the given degree and either a level structure, or what we call a partial level structure. In every case, the moduli space is rational or unirational. In additional, several new Calabi-Yau threefolds fibred in abelian surfaces are described.
