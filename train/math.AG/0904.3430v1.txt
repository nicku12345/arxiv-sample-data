We introduce a notion of a connection on a coherent sheaf on a weighted projective line (in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing). Using a theorem of Huebner and Lenzing we show, under a mild hypothesis, that if one considers coherent sheaves equipped with such a connection, and one passes to the perpendicular category to a nonzero vector bundle without self-extensions, then the resulting category is equivalent to the category of representations of a deformed preprojective algebra.
