We establish a relationship between the graded quotients of a filtered holonomic D-module, their sheaf-theoretic duals, and the characteristic variety, in case the filtered D-module underlies a polarized Hodge module on a smooth algebraic variety. The proof is based on Saito's result that the associated graded module is Cohen-Macaulay, and on local duality on the cotangent bundle.
