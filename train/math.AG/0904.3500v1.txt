Bridgeland stability conditions allow for a new generalization of Thaddeus pairs to surfaces and a new interpretation of Reider's theorem as a consequence of "Schur's lemma" for stable objects (Hom(E,F) = 0 if E,F are stable objects and the slope of E exceeds the slope of F). One improvement of Reider's theorem results (Proposition 3.8/Corollary 3.9), and wall-crossings for the new Thaddeus pairs are discussed. This paper was submitted to the CMI conference proceedings celebrating the 65th birthday of Peter Newstead.
