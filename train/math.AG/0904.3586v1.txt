We construct new subvarieties in the varieties of power sums for certain quartic hypersurfaces. This provides a generalization of Mukai's description of smooth prime Fano threefolds of genus twelve as the varieties of power sums for plane quartics. In fact, in our second paper, we show that these quartics are exactly the Scorza quartics associated to general pairs of trigonal curves and ineffective theta characteristics and this enables us to prove there the main cojecture of Dolgachev and Kanev.
