We prove that for any monoid scheme M over a field with proper multiplication maps from M x M to M, we have a natural PD-structure on the ideal CH_{>0}(M) of CH(M) with regard to the Pontryagin ring structure. Further we investigate to what extent it is possible to define a Fourier transform on the motive with integral coefficients of the Jacobian of a curve. For a hyperelliptic curve of genus g with sufficiently many k-rational Weierstrass points, we construct such an integral Fourier transform with all the usual properties up to 2^N-torsion, where N is the integral part of 1 + log_2(3g). As a consequence we obtain, over an algebraically closed field, a PD-structure (for the intersection product) on 2^N A, where A is the augmentation ideal of CH(J). We show that a factor 2 in the properties of an integral Fourier transform cannot be eliminated even for elliptic curves over an algebraically closed field.
