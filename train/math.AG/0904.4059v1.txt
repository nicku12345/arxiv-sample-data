This is the first article in an upcoming series of papers. They have arisen through an attempt to answer open questions of Deligne proposed in "Le determinant de la cohomologie", Contemp. Mathematics 67 (1987). It amounts to functorial and metrized versions of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, as well as a Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formula in the sense of Thomason, cf. "Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorem and coherent trace formula" Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm. Sup. 18 (1985), Theorem 3.5. In this article we treat various preliminary results on virtual categories which are the categories where the Deligne-Riemann-Roch theorem is originally formulated. Finally we compare our constructions to constructions of Franke on Chern intersection functors and Chow categories.
