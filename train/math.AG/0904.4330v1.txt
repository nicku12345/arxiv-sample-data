We investigate Hochschild cohomology and homology of admissible subcategories of derived categories of coherent sheaves on smooth projective varieties. We show that the Hochschild cohomology of an admissible subcategory is isomorphic to the derived endomorphisms of the kernel giving the corresponding projection functor, and the Hochschild homology is isomorphic to derived morphisms from this kernel to its convolution with the kernel of the Serre functor. We investigate some basic properties of Hochschild homology and cohomology of admissible subcategories. In particular, we check that the Hochschild homology is additive with respect to semiorthogonal decompositions and construct some long exact sequences relating the Hochschild cohomology of a category and its semiorthogonal components. We also compute Hochschild homology and cohomology of some interesting admissible subcategories, in particular of the nontrivial components of derived categories of some Fano threefolds and of the nontrivial components of the derived categories of conic bundles.
