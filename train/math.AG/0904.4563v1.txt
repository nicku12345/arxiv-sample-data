Let \pi : Z \to X be Galois cover of smooth projective curves with Galois group W a Weyl group of a simple Lie group G. For a dominant weight \lambda, we consider the intermediate curve Y_\lambda= Z/\Stab(\lambda). One can realise a Prym variety P_\lambda \subset \Jac(Y_\lambda) and we denote \varphi_\lambda the restriction of the principal polarisation of \Jac(Y_\lambda) upon P_\lambda. For two dominant weights \lambda and \mu, we construct a correspondence \Delta_{\lambda \mu} on Y_\lambda \times Y_\mu and calculate the pull-back of \varphi_\mu by \Delta_{\lambda \mu} in terms of \varphi_\lambda.
