We show a combinatorial formula for a lower bound of the dimension of the non-unipotent monodromy part of the first Milnor cohomology of a hyperplane arrangement satisfying some combinatorial conditions. This gives exactly its dimension if a stronger combinatorial condition is satisfied. We also prove a non-combinatorial formula for the dimension of the non-unipotent part of the first Milnor cohomology, which apparently depends on the position of the singular points. The latter generalizes a formula previously obtained by the second named author.
