By using row convex tableaux, we study the section rings of Bott-Samelson varieties of type A. We obtain flat deformations and standard monomial type bases of the section rings. In a separate section, we investigate a three dimensional Bott-Samelson variety in detail and compute its Hilbert polynomial and toric degenerations.
