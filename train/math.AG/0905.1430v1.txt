In this paper, we prove that: For any given finitely many distinct points P_1,...,P_r and a closed subvariety S of codimension \geq 2 in a complete toric variety over a uncountable (characteristic 0) algebraically closed field, there exists a rational curve f:\mathbb{P}^1\to X passing through P_1,...,P_r, disjoint from S\setminus \{P_1,...,P_r\} (see Main Theorem). As a corollary, we prove that the smooth loci of complete toric varieties are strongly rationally connected.
