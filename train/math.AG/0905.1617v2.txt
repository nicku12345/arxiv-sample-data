Let {\mathcal B}_u be the Springer fiber over a nilpotent endomorphism u\in End(\mathbb{C}^n). Let J(u) be the Jordan form of u regarded as a partition of n. The irreducible components of {\mathcal B}_u are all of the same dimension. They are labelled by Young tableaux of shape J(u). We study the question of singularity of the components of {\mathcal B}_u and show that all the components of {\mathcal B}_u are nonsingular if and only if J(u)\in\{(\lambda,1,1,...), (\lambda_1,\lambda_2), (\lambda_1,\lambda_2,1), (2,2,2)\}.
