We study the relation among the genus 0 Gromov-Witten theories of the three spaces \mathcal{X}\leftarrow\mathcal{Z}\leftarrow Y, where \mathcal{X}=[\c^2/\z_3], \mathcal{Z} is obtained by a weighted blowup at the stacky point of \mathcal{X}, and Y is the crepant resolution of the A_2 singularity. We formulate and verify a statement similar to the Crepant Resolution Conjecture of Bryan and Graber.b
