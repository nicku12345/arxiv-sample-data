In previous papers the authors gave formulae for generating series of classes (in the Grothendieck ring of complex quasi-projective varieties) of Hilbert schemes of zero-dimensional subschemes on smooth varieties and on orbifolds in terms of certain local data and the, so called, power structure over the corresponding ring. Here we give an analogue of these formulae for equivariant (with respect to an action of a finite group on a smooth variety) Hilbert schemes of zero-dimensional subschemes and compute some local generating series for an action of the cyclic group on a smooth surface.
