Let C be a projective Gorenstein curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. A generalized linear system on C is a pair (I,f) consisting of a torsion-free, rank-1 sheaf I on C and a map of vector spaces f to the space of global sections of I. If the system is nondegenerate on every irreducible component of C, we associate to it a 0-cycle W, its Weierstrass cycle. Then we show that for each one-parameter family of curves C(t) degenerating to C, and each family of linear systems (L(t),f(t)) along C(t), with L(t) invertible, degenerating to (I,f), the corresponding Weierstrass divisors degenerate to a subscheme whose associated 0-cycle is W. We show that the limit subscheme contains always an "intrinsic" subscheme, canonically associated to (I,f), but the limit itself depends on the family L(t).
