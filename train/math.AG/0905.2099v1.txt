In [1] some quotients of one-parameter families of Calabi-Yau varieties are related to the family of Mirror Quintics by using a construction due to Shioda. In this paper, we generalize this construction to a wider class of varieties. More specifically, let A be an invertible matrix with non-negative integer entries. We introduce varieties X_A and \overline{M}_A in weighted projective space and in {\mathbb P}^n, respectively. The variety \overline{M}_A turns out to be a quotient of a Fermat variety by a finite group. As a by-product, X_A is a quotient of a Fermat variety and \overline{M}_A is a quotient of X_A by a finite group. We apply this construction to some families of Calabi-Yau manifolds in order to show their birationality.
