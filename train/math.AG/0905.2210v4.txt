Let K be a mixed characteristic complete discrete valuation field with perfect residue field k. Let X be a variety over k, Y be an open of X, Y' be an open of Y dense in X. We extend Kedlaya's full faithfulness as follows (we do not suppose Y to be smooth): the canonical functor F\text{-}\mathrm{Isoc} ^{\dag} (Y,X/K) \to F\text{-}\mathrm{Isoc} ^{\dag} (Y,Y/K)  is fully faithfull.   Suppose now Y smooth. We construct the category of partially overcoherent isocrystals over (Y,X) denoted by \mathrm{Isoc} ^{\dag\dag} (Y,X/K)  whose objects are some particular arithmetic \D-modules. Furthermore, we check the equivalence of categories \sp_{(Y,X),+} : \mathrm{Isoc} ^{\dag} (Y,X/K) \cong \mathrm{Isoc} ^{\dag\dag} (Y,X/K).
