For X a complete, reduced, geometrically connected scheme over a perfect field of characteristic p>0, we analyze the decomposition of Nori's fundamental group scheme into its local and \'etale parts and raise the question of the relation between the geometry and the splitting of the group scheme. We also describe in categorial terms the functor which corresponds to the inclusion of the maximal reduced subgroup scheme.
