Shokurov conjectured that the set of all log canonical thresholds on varieties of bounded dimension satisfies the ascending chain condition. In this paper we prove that the conjecture holds for log canonical thresholds on smooth varieties and, more generally, on locally complete intersection varieties and on varieties with quotient singularities.
