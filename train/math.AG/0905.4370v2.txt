We give a necessary and sufficient condition for an automorphism of the Hilbert scheme of points on a K3 surface (non necessarily algebraic) to be induced by an automorphism of the surface. We prove furthermore that the group of birational transformations of a projective irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold is finitely generated.
