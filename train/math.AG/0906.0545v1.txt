Ross and Thomas have shown that subschemes can K-destabilise polarised varieties, yielding a notion known as slope (in)stability for varieties. Here we describe a special situation in which slope instability for varieties (for example of general type) corresponds to a slope instability type condition for certain bundles, making the computations almost trivial.
