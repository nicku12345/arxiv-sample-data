K3-surfaces with antisymplectic involution and compatible symplectic actions of finite groups are considered. In this situation actions of large finite groups of symplectic transformations are shown to arise via double covers of Del Pezzo surfaces. A complete classification of K3-surfaces with maximal symplectic symmetry is obtained.
