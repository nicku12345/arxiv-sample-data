We describe a general framework for large-scale computational experiments in mathematics using computer resources that are available in most mathematics departments. This framework was developed for an experiment that is helping to formulate and test conjectures in the real Schubert calculus. Largely using machines in instructional computer labs during off-hours and University breaks, it consumed in excess of 350 GigaHertz-years of computing in its first six months of operation, solving over 1.1 billion polynomial systems.
