It is known that the moduli space of plane quartic curves is birational to an arithmetic quotient of a 6-dimensional complex ball. In this paper, we shall show that there exists a 15-dimensional space of meromorphic automorphic forms on the complex ball which gives a birational embedding of the moduli space of plane quartics with level 2 structure into 14-dimensional projective space. This map coincides with the one given by Coble by using Gopel invariants.
