The subalgebra of the tautological ring of the moduli of curves of compact type generated by the kappa classes is studied. Relations, constructed via the virtual geometry of the moduli of stable maps, are used to prove universality results relating the kappa rings in genus 0 to higher genus. Predictions for kappa classes of the Gorenstein conjecture are proven.
