Given a smooth toric variety X, the action of the torus T lifts to the moduli space \mathcal{M} of stable sheaves on X. Using the pioneering work of Klyacho, a fairly explicit combinatorial description of the fixed point locus \mathcal{M}^T can be given (as shown by earlier work of the author). In this paper, we apply this description to the case of torsion free sheaves on a smooth toric surface S. A general expression for the generating function of the Euler characteristics of such moduli spaces is obtained. The generating function is expressed in terms of Euler characteristics of certain moduli spaces of stable configurations of linear subspaces appearing in classical GIT. The expression holds for any choice of S, polarization, rank, and first Chern class. Specializing to various examples allows us to compute some new as well as known generating functions.
