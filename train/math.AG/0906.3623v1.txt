We develop technics of birational geometry to study automorphisms of affine surfaces admitting many distinct rational fibrations, with a particular focus on the interactions between automorphisms and these fibrations. In particular, we associate to each surface S of this type a graph encoding equivalence classes of rational fibrations from which it is possible to decide for instance if the automorphism group of S is generated by automorphisms preserving these fibrations.
