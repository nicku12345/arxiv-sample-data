It is well-known that del Pezzo surfaces of degree 9-n one-to-one correspond to flat E_n bundles over an elliptic curve. In this paper, we construct ADE bundles over a broader class of rational surfaces which we call ADE surfaces, and extend the above correspondence to all flat G bundles over an elliptic curve, where G is any simply laced, simple, compact and simply-connected Lie group. In the sequel, we will construct G bundles for non-simply laced Lie group G over these rational surfaces, and extend the above correspondence to non-simply laced cases.
