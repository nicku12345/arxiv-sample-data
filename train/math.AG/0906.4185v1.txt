We construct and study two series of curves whose Jacobians admit complex multiplication. The curves arise as quotients of Galois coverings of the projective line with Galois group metacyclic groups G_{q,3} of order 3q with q \equiv 1 \mod 3 an odd prime, and G_m of order 2^{m+1}. The complex multiplications arise as quotients of double coset algebras of the Galois groups of these coverings. We work out the CM-types and show that the Jacobians are simple abelian varieties.
