Let X be a smooth genus g curve equipped with a simple morphism f: X -> C, where C is either the projective line or more generally any smooth curve whose gonality is computed by finitely many pencils. Here we apply a method developed by Aprodu to prove that if g is big enough then X satisfies both Green and Green-Lazarsfeld conjectures. We also partially address the case in which the gonality of C is computed by infinitely many pencils.
