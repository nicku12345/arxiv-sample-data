In this paper we consider the birational classification of pairs (S,L), with S a rational surfaces and L a linear system on S. We give a classification theorem for such pairs and we determine, for each irreducible plane curve B, its "Cremona minimal" models, i.e. those plane curves which are equivalent to B via a Cremona transformation, and have minimal degree under this condition.
