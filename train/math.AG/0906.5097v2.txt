There are two well known tasks, related to Newton polyhedra: to study invariants of singularities in terms of their Newton polyhedra, and to describe Newton polyhedra of resultants and discriminants. We introduce so called resultantal singularities, whose study in terms of Newton polyhedra unifies these two tasks to a certain extent. As an application, we study topological invariants of determinantal singularities and (co)vector fields on singular varieties in terms of Newton polyhedra, and provide new formulations and proofs for a number of well known results. The computations are based on certain relative versions of the mixed volume and the Kouchnirenko--Bernstein--Khovanskii formula. For the most part, this is a significantly updated exposition of material from four recent papers by the author.
