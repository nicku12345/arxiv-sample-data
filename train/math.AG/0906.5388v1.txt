In this paper we investigate Fano manifolds X whose Chern characters ch_k(X) satisfy some positivity conditions. Our approach is via the study of polarized minimal families of rational curves (H_x,L_x) through a general point x\in X. First we translate positivity properties of the Chern characters of X into properties of the pair (H_x,L_x). This allows us to classify polarized minimal families of rational curves associated to Fano manifolds X satisfying ch_2(X)\geq0 and ch_3(X)\geq0. As a first application, we provide sufficient conditions for these manifolds to be covered by subvarieties isomorphic to \mathbb P^2 and \mathbb P^3. Moreover, this classification enables us to find new examples of Fano manifolds satisfying ch_2(X)\geq0.
