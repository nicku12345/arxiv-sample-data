The \textit{Enriched Riemann Sphere} \C P_*^1 is \C P^1 plus a set of \textit{infinitesimals}, having the Newton-Puiseux field \F as coordinates. Complex Analysis is extended to the \F-\textit{Analysis} (\textit{Newton-Puiseux Analysis}). The classical \textit{Morse Stability Theorem} is also extended; the \textit{stability idea} is used to formulate an \textit{equi-singular deformation theorem} in \C\{x,y\}(=\mathcal{O}_2).
