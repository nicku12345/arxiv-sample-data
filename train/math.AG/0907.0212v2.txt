We prove results generalizing the classical Riemann Singularity Theorem to the case of integral, singular curves. The main result is a computation of the multiplicity of the theta divisor of an integral, nodal curve at an arbitrary point. We also conjecture a general formula for the multiplicity of points on the theta divisor of a singular integral curve and present some evidence for this conjecture. Our results give a partial answer to a question posed by Lucia Caporaso in a recent paper.
