In the paper a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for \textit{v-}sufficiency (equiv. \textit{sv-}sufficiency) of jets of map-germs f:(\mathbb{R}^{n},0)\to (\mathbb{R}^{m},0) is proved which generalize both the Kuiper-Kuo and the Thom conditions in the function case (m=1) so as the Kuo conditions in the general map case (m>1). Contrary to the Kuo conditions the conditions proved in the paper do not require to verify any inequalities in a so-called horn-neighborhood of the (a'priori unknown) set f^{-1}(0). Instead, the proposed conditions reduce the problem on \textit{v-}sufficiency of jets to evaluating the local {\L}ojasiewicz exponents for some constructively built polynomial functions.
