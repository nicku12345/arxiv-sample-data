We give many examples in which there exist infinitely many divisorial conditions on the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces (S,H) of degree H^2=2g-2, g \geq 3, and Picard number rk N(S)=\rho(S)=2 such that for a general K3 surface S satisfying these conditions the moduli space of sheaves M_S(r,H,s) is birationally equivalent to the Hilbert scheme S[g-rs] of zero-dimensional subschemes of S of lenght equal to g-rs. This result generalizes the main result of \cite{Nik1} when g=rs+1 and of \cite{Monat} when r=s=2, g \geq 5.
