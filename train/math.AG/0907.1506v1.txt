We describe the foundation of the log minimal model program for log canonical pairs according to Ambro's idea. We generalize Koll\'ar's vanishing and torsion-free theorems for embedded simple normal crossing pairs. Then we prove the cone and contraction theorems for quasi-log varieties, especially, for log canonical pairs.
