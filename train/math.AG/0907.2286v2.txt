We obtain a complete description of the effective cone of C_{g-2} when C is a general curve of genus g \geq 6, as well as a new bound in the case where C is a smooth plane quintic. In addition, we obtain a new virtual bound for the effective cone of C_{g-2m} which is a genuine bound when m=2, and we also characterize certain natural divisors on C_{g-2} as subordinate loci associated to adjunctions of kernel bundles.
