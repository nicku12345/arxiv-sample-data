We investigate the manifold \cal{M} of (real) quadratic forms in n > 1 variables having a multiple eigenvalue. In addition to known facts, we prove that 1) \cal{M} is irreducible, 2) in the case of n = 3, scalar matrices and only them are singular points on \cal{M}.   For n = 3, \cal{M} is also described as the straight cylinder over \cal{M}_0, where \cal{M}_0 is the cone over the orbit of the diagonal matrix \diag(1,1,-2) by the orthogonal changes of coordinates. We analyze certain properties of this orbit, which occurs a diffeomorphic image of the projective plane.
