We develop a mixed-characteristic version of the Mori-Mukai technique for producing rational curves on K3 surfaces. We reduce modulo p, produce rational curves on the resulting K3 surface over a finite field, and lift to characteristic zero. As an application, we prove that all complex K3 surfaces with Picard group generated by a class of degree two have an infinite number of rational curves.
