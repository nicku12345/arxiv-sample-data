We give examples of stable rank 2 vector bundles on principally polarized abelian threefolds, and study their deformations. The starting point is the Serre construction, which gives a source of examples, and which we rephrase in terms of Barth--Hulek like monads. Using the monad description, we compute the dimension of the space of first order infinitesimal deformations of these bundles. Moreover, we obtain a birational description of a 13-dimensional component of the moduli space for stable vector bundles.
