Let X and Y be two smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks and consider a function f, resp. g, on X, resp. Y. Assume that there exists a complex F of sheaves on the fiber product of X and Y over A^1 (induced by f and g), such that the Fourier-Mukai transform with the kernel F gives an equivalence between the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on X and Y. If X_0 Y_0 are the fibers of f and g over zero, respectively, we show that the singular derived categories of X_0 and Y_0 are also equivalent. We apply this statement in the setting of McKay correspondence, and generalize a result of Orlov on the derived category of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a weighted projective space, to products of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in simplicial toric varieties with nef anticanonical class.
