We study Galois points for a hypersurface X with \dim {\rm Sing}(X) \le \dim X-2. The purpose of this article is to determine the set \Delta(X) of Galois points in characteristic zero: Indeed, we give a sharp upper bound of the number of Galois points in terms of \dim X and \dim {\rm Sing}(X) if \Delta(X) is a finite set, and prove that X is a cone if \Delta(X) is infinite. To achieve our purpose, we need a certain hyperplane section theorem on Galois point. We prove this theorem in arbitrary characteristic. On the other hand, the hyperplane section theorem has other important applications: For example, we can classify the Galois group induced from a Galois point in arbitrary characteristic and determine the distribution of Galois points for a Fermat hypersurface of degree p^e+1 in characteristic p>0.
