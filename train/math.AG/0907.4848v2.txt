Let X be a projective manifold containing a quasi-line l. An important difference between quasi-lines and lines in the projective space is that in general there is more than one quasi-line passing through two given general points. In this paper we use this feature to construct an algebraic foliation associated to a family of quasi-lines. We prove that if the singular locus of this foliation is not too large, it induces a rational fibration on X that maps the general leaf of the foliation onto a quasi-line in a rational variety.
