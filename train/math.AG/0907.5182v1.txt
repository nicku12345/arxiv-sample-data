We first introduce a weak type of Zariski decomposition in higher dimensions: an \R-Cartier divisor has a weak Zariski decomposition if birationally and in a numerical sense it can be written as the sum of a nef and an effective \R-Cartier divisor. We then prove that there is a very basic relation between Zariski decompositions and log minimal models which has long been expected: we prove that assuming the log minimal model program in dimension d-1, a lc pair (X/Z,B) of dimension d has a log minimal model if and only if K_X+B has a weak Zariski decomposition/Z.
