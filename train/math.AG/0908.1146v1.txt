If two schemes are isomorphic, then their m-jet schemes are isomorphic for all m. In this paper we consider the converse problem. We prove that if an isomorphism of the m-jet schemes is induced from a morphism of the base schemes, then the morphism of the base schemes is an isomorphism. But we also prove that just the existence of isomorphisms between m-jet schemes does not yield the existence of an isomorphism between the base schemes.
