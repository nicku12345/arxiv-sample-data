For any non-simply laced Lie group G and elliptic curve \Sigma, we show that the moduli space of flat G bundles over \Sigma can be identified with the moduli space of rational surfaces with G-configurations which contain \Sigma as an anti-canonical curve. We also construct Lie(G)-bundles over these surfaces. The corresponding results for simply laced groups were obtained by the authors in another paper. Thus we have established a natural identification for these two kinds of moduli spaces for any Lie group G.
