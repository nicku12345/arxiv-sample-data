The paper is a generalization of a result of I. Dolgachev, M. Mendes Lopes, and R. Pardini.   We prove that a smooth projective complex surface X, not necessarily minimal, contains h^{1,1}(X)-1 disjoint (-2)-curves if and only if X is isomorphic to a minimal rational ruled surface {\bf F}_2 or {\bf P}^2 or a fake projective plane.   We also describe smooth projective complex surfaces X with h^{1,1}(X)-2 disjoint (-2)-curves.
