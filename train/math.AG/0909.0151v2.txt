Let \cM_{0,n} the moduli space of n-pointed rational curves. The aim of this note is to give a new, geometric construction of \cM_{0,2n}^{GIT}, the GIT compacification of \cM_{0,2n}, in terms of linear systems on \PP^{2n-2} that contract all the rational normal curves passing by the points of a projective base. These linear systems are a projective analogue of the forgetful maps between \bar{\cM}_{0,2n+1} and \bar{\cM}_{0,2n}. The construction is performed via a study of the so-called \textit{contraction} maps from the Knudsen-Mumford compactification \bar{\cM}_{0,2n} to \cM_{0,2n}^{GIT} and of the canonical forgetful maps. As a side result we also find a linear system on \bar{\cM}_{0,2n} whose associated map is the contraction map c_{2n}.
