Let G be a complex connected reductive algebraic group and G/B denote the flag variety of G. A G-homogeneous space G/H is said to be {\it spherical} if H acts on G/B with finitely many orbits. A class of spherical homogeneous spaces containing the tori, the complete homogeneous spaces and the group G (viewed as a G\times G-homogeneous space) has particularly nice proterties. Namely, the pair (G,H) is called a {\it spherical pair of minimal rank} if there exists x in G/B such that the orbit H.x of x by H is open in G/B and the stabilizer H_x of x in H contains a maximal torus of H. In this article, we study and classify the spherical pairs of minimal rank.
