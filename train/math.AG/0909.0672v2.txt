We classify the minimal surfaces of general type with K^2 \leq 4\chi-8 whose canonical map is composed with a pencil, up to a finite number of families.   More precisely we prove that there is exactly one irreducible family for each value of \chi \gg 0, 4\chi-10 \leq K^2 \leq 4\chi-8. All these surfaces are complete intersections in a toric 4-fold and bidouble covers of Hirzebruch surfaces. The surfaces with K^2=4\chi-8 were previously constructed by Catanese as bidouble covers of \PP^1 \times \PP^1.
