We explore the theory of connected Gromov-Witten invariants of the symmetric product stack [Sym^n(A_r)]. We derive closed-form expressions for all equivariant invariants with two insertions and reveal a natural correspondence between the theory and the relative Gromov-Witten theory of the threefold A_r x P^1. When n is less than or equal to 3, we determine 3-point (usual) Gromov-Witten invariants of [Sym^n(A_1)].
