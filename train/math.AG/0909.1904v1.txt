Mixed functions are analytic functions in variables z_1,..., z_n and their conjugates \bar z_1,..., \bar z_n. We introduce the notion of Newton non-degeneracy for mixed functions and develop a basic tool for the study of mixed hypersurface singularities. We show the existence of a canonical resolution of the singularity, and the existence of the Milnor fibration under the strong non-degeneracy condition.
