We consider exceptional APN functions on {\bf F}_{2^m}, which by definition are functions that are not APN on infinitely many extensions of {\bf F}_{2^m}. Our main result is that polynomial functions of odd degree are not exceptional, provided the degree is not a Gold member (2^k+1) or a Kasami-Welch number (4^k-2^k+1). We also have partial results on functions of even degree, and functions that have degree 2^k+1.
