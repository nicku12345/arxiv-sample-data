The study of the projective coordinate ring of the (geometric invariant theory) moduli space of n ordered points on P^1 up to automorphisms began with Kempe in 1894, who proved that the ring is generated in degree one in the main (n even, unit weight) case. We describe the relations among the invariants for all possible weights. In the main case, we show that up to the symmetric group symmetry, there is a single equation. For n not 6, it is a simple quadratic binomial relation. (For n=6, it is the classical Segre cubic relation.) For general weights, the ideal of relations is generated by quadratics inherited from the case of 8 points. This paper completes the program set out in [HMSV1].
