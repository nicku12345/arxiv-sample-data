Consider the projective coordinate ring of the GIT quotient (P^1)^n//SL(2), with the usual linearization, where n is even. In 1894, Kempe proved that this ring is generated in degree one. In [HMSV2] we showed that, over the rationals, the relations between degree one invariants are generated by a class of quadratic relations -- the simplest binomial relations -- with the exception of n=6, where there is a single cubic relation. The purpose of this paper is to show that these results hold over Z[1/12!], and to suggest why they may be true over Z[1/6].
