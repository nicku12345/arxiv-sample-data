We first describe a canonical mirror partner (B-model) of the small quantum orbifold cohomology of weighted projective spaces (A-model) in the framework of differential equations: we attach to the A-model (resp. B-model) a D-module on the torus and we show that these two D-modules are isomorphic. This makes the A and B-models mirror partners and yields, in this situation, an explicit and finer version of a recent result of Iritani. Then we study, using the theory of the Kashiwara-Malgrange filtration, their degenerations at the origin and we apply our results to the construction of (classical, limit, logarithmic) Frobenius manifolds.
