Let f_{{\bf a},\{bf b}}({\bf z},\bar{\bf z})=z_1^{a_1+b_1}\bar z_1^{b_1}+...+z_n^{a_n+b_n}\bar z_n^{b_n} be a polar weighted homogeneous mixed polynomial with a_j>0,b_j\ge 0, j=1,..., n and let f_{{\bf a}}({\bf z})=z_1^{a_1}+...+z_n^{a_n} be the associated weighted homogeneous polynomial. Consider the corresponding link variety K_{{\bf a},{\bf b}}=f_{{\bf a},{\bf b}}\inv(0)\cap S^{2n-1} and K_{{\bf a}}=f_{{\bf a}}\inv(0)\cap S^{2n-1}. Ruas-Seade-Verjovsky \cite{R-S-V} proved that the Milnor fibrations of f_{{\bf a},{\bf b}} and f_{{\bf a}} are topologically equivalent and the mixed link K_{{\bf a},{\bf b}} is homeomorphic to the complex link K_{{\bf a}}. We will prove that they are C^\infty equivalent and two links are diffeomorphic. We show the same assertion for  f({\bf z},\bar{\bf z})=z_1^{a_1+b_1}\bar z_1^{b_1}z_2+...+z_{n-1}^{a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}}\bar z_{n-1}^{b_{n-1}}z_n+z_n^{a_n+b_n}\bar z_n^{b_n} and its associated polynomial  g({\bf z})=z_1^{a_1}z_2+...+ z_{n-1}^{a_{n-1}}z_n+z_n^{a_n}.
