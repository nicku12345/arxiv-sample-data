Let f: X\to Y be a surjective morphism of smooth n-dimensional projective varieties, with Y of maximal Albanese dimension. Hacon and Pardini studied the structure of f assuming P_m(X)=P_m(Y) for some m\geq 2. We extend their result by showing that, under the above assumtions, f is birationally equivalent to a quotient by a finite abelian group. We also study the pluricanonical map of varieties of maximal Albanese dimesnion. The main result is that the linear series |5K_X| incuces the Iitaka model of X.
