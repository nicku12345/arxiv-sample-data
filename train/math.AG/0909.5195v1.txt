We give an overview of results on irregular complex surfaces of general type, discussing in particular the distribution of the numerical invariants self-intersection of a canonical divisor and holomorphic Euler characteristic for the minimal ones. This is an expanded version of the talk given by the second author at the workshop "Classical Algebraic Geometry Today", M.S.R.I., January 26--30, 2009.
