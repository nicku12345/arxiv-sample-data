Consider the formal power series \sum [C_{p, \alpha}(X)]t^{\alpha} (called Motivic Chow Series), where C_p(X)=\disjoint C_{p, \alpha}(X) is the Chow variety of X parametrizing the p-dimensional effective cycles on X with C_{p, \alpha}(X) its connected components, and [C_{p, \alpha}(X)] its class in K(ChM)_{A^1}, the K-ring of Chow motives modulo A^1 homotopy. Using Picard product formula and Torus action, we will show that the Motivic Chow Series is rational in many cases. We have added the computation of the motivic zeta series in some of our examples so the reader can compare both series in each case.
