We give an explicit construction for the extension of a symmetric determinantal quartic K3 surface to a Fano 6-fold. Remarkably, the moduli of the 6-fold extension are in one-to-one correspondence with the moduli of the quartic surface. As a consequence, we determine a 16-parameter family of surfaces of general type with p_g=1 and K^2=2 as weighted complete intersections inside Fano 6-folds.
