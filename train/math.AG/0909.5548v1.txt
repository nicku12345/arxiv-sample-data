We study the extension of a hyperelliptic K3 surface to a Fano 6-fold. This determines a family of surfaces of general type with p_g=1, K^2=2 and hyperelliptic canonical curve, where each surface is a weighted complete intersection inside a Fano 6-fold. Finally, we use these hyperelliptic surfaces to determine an 8-parameter family of Godeaux surfaces with torsion Z/2.
