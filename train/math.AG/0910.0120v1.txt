For n\geq 3, let \mathcal{M}_{0,n} denote the moduli space of genus 0 curves with n marked points, and \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n} its smooth compactification. A theorem due to Ginzburg, Kapranov and Getzler states that the inverse of the exponential generating series for the Poincar\'e polynomial of H^{\bullet}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n}) is given by the corresponding series for H^{\bullet}(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}). In this paper, we prove that the inverse of the ordinary generating series for the Poincar\'e polynomial of H^{\bullet}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n}) is given by the corresponding series for H^{\bullet}(\mathcal{M}^{\delta}_{0,n}), where \mathcal{M}_{0,n}\subset \mathcal{M}^{\delta}_{0,n} \subset \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n} is a certain smooth affine scheme.
