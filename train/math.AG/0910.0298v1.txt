Let C \subseteq \P^d denote the rational normal curve of order d. Its homogeneous defining ideal I_C \subseteq \QQ[a_0,...,a_d] admits an SL_2-stable filtration J_2 \subseteq J_4 \subseteq ... \subseteq I_C by sub-ideals such that the saturation of each J_{2q} equals I_C. Hence, one can associate to d a sequence of integers (\alpha_1,\alpha_2,...) which encodes the degrees in which the successive inclusions in this filtration become trivial. In this paper we establish several lower and upper bounds on the \alpha_q, using \emph{inter alia} the methods of classical invariant theory.
