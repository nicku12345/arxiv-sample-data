Given a fibre space X/S with the generic geometric fibre of Kodaira dimension \geq 0, we shall construct a variety Y ramified over X along such a horizontal hyperplane with respect to X/S that Koll\'ar and Kawamata had proved Viehweg conjecture for Y/S with the generic geometric fibre of general type or of the abundant canonical invertible sheaf where Viehweg dimensions of X/S and Y/S are equal, respectively. We shall show that Viehweg dimension of X/S is not greater than that of Y/S by Mochizuki's Galois theory.
