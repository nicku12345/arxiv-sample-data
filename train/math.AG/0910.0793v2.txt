We show that the dual of the Cayley cone, associated to a Minkowski sum decomposition of a reflexive polytope, contains a reflexive polytope admitting a nef-partition. This nef-partition corresponds to a Calabi-Yau complete intersection in a Gorenstein Fano toric variety degenerating to an ample Calabi-Yau hypersurface in another Fano toric variety. Using the Batyrev-Borisov mirror symmetry construction, we found the mirror contraction of a Calabi-Yau complete intersection to the mirror of the ample Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
