The aim of this note is to use the concept of algebra husks to prove an analog of the flattening decomposition theorem for simultaneous normalizations. Other applications improve earlier flatness criteria. Parts of this note were contained in the first version of "Hulls and Husks" (arXiv:0805.0576).   Dec. 16: new references added.
