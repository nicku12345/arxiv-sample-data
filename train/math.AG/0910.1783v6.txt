We propose a new method to study birational maps between Fano varieties based on multiplier ideal sheaves. Using this method, we prove equivariant birational rigidity of four Fano threefolds acted on by the group A6. As an application, we obtain that the Cremona group of rank 3 has at least five non-conjugate subgroups isomorphic to A6.
