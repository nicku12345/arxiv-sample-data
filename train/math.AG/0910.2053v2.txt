We investigate the jumping conics of stable vector bundles E of rank 2 on a smooth quadric surface Q with the first Chern class c_1=\Oo_Q(-1,-1) with respect to the ample line bundle \Oo_Q(1,1). We show that the set of jumping conics of E is a hypersurface of degree c_2(E)-1 in \PP_3^*. Using these hypersurfaces, we describe moduli spaces of stable vector bundles of rank 2 on Q in the cases of lower c_2(E).
