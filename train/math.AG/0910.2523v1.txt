Let f(\bfz,\bar\bfz) be a mixed polar homogeneous polynomial of n variables \bfz=(z_1,..., z_n). It defines a projective real algebraic variety V:=\{[\bfz]\in \BC\BP^{n-1} | f(\bfz,\bar\bfz)=0 \} in the projective space \BC\BP^{n-1}. The behavior is different from that of the projective hypersurface. The topology is not uniquely determined by the degree of the variety even if V is non-singular. We study a basic property of such a variety.
