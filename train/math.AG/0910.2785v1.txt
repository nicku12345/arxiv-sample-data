Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension three and let L be an ample line bundle on X. In this paper, we provide a lower bound of the dimension of the global sections of m(K_{X}+L) under the assumption that \kappa(K_{X}+L) is non-negative. In particular, we get the following: (1) if \kappa(K_{X}+L) is greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to two, then h^{0}(K_{X}+L) is positive. (2) If \kappa(K_{X}+L) is equal to three, then h^{0}(2(K_{X}+L)) is greater than or equal to three. Moreover we get a classification of (X,L) such that \kappa(K_{X}+L) is equal to three and h^{0}(2(K_{X}+L)) is equal to three or four.
