Generalizing work done by Miyaoka and others in the case of divisors and of curves, we compute the cones of effective cycles of arbitrary dimension on a projective bundle over a complex projective curve in terms of the numerical data in an associated Harder-Narasimhan filtration. An application to cycles on projective bundles over a smooth complex projective base of arbitrary dimension is also given.
