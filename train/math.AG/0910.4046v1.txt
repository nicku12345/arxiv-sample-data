In this paper we study properties of numbers K_n^l of connected components of bifurcation diagrams for multiboundary singularities B_n^l. These numbers generalize classic Bernoulli-Euler numbers. We prove a recurrent relation on the numbers K_n^l. As it was known before, K^1_n is (n{+}1)-th Bernoulli-Euler number, this gives us a necessary boundary condition to calculate K_n^l. We also find the generating functions for K_n^l with small fixed l and write partial differential equations for the general case. The recurrent relations lead to numerous relations between Bernoulli-Euler numbers. We show them in the last section of the paper.
