This article is the first one of a series of three articles devoted to direct images of isocrystals: here we consider isocrystals without Frobenius structure; in the second one (resp. the third one), we will introduce a Frobenius structure in the convergent (resp. overconvergent) context. For a liftable proper smooth morphism we establish the overconvergence of direct images, owing to a base change theorem for a proper morphism between rigid analytic spaces. This result partially answers a conjecture of Berthelot on the overconvergence of direct images under a proper smooth morphism.
