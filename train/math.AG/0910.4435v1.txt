This article is the third one of a series of three articles devoted to direct images of isocrystals: here we consider overconvergent isocrystals with Frobenius structure. For a liftable proper smooth morphism we establish the overconvergence of direct images, owing to the first article and the existence of lifts of Frobenius. This result partially answers a conjecture of Berthelot on the overconvergence of direct images of overconvergent F-isocrystals under a proper smooth morphism.
