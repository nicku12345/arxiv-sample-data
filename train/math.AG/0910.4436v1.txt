Syntomic cohomology here defined yields a link between rigid cohomology and etale cohomology, viewing the last one as the fixed points under Frobenius of the former one. Let V be a complete discrete valuation ring, with perfect residue field k = V/m of characteristic p > 0 and fraction field K of characteristic 0. Having defined syntomic cohomology with compact supports of an abelian sheaf G on a k-scheme X, we show that it coincides with etale cohomology with compact supports when G is a lisse sheaf. If moreover the convergent F-isocrystal associated to G comes from an overconvergent isocrystal E, then the rigid cohomology of E expresses as a limit of syntomic cohomologies: then the etale cohomology with compact supports of G is the fixed points of Frobenius acting on the rigid cohomology of E.
