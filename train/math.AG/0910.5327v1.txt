We decompose each moduli space of semistable sheaves on the complex projective plane with support of dimension one and degree four into locally closed subvarieties, each subvariety being the good or geometric quotient of a set of morphisms of locally free sheaves modulo a reductive or a nonreductive group. We find locally free resolutions of length one of all these sheaves and describe them.
