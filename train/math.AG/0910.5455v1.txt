Ellingsrud and Peskine (1989) proved that there exists a bound on the degree of smooth non general type surfaces in P^4. The latest proven bound is 52 by Decker and Schreyer in 2000.   In this paper we consider bounds on the degree of a quasismooth non-general type surface in weighted projective 4-space. We show that such a bound in terms of the weights exists, and compute an explicit bound in simple cases.
