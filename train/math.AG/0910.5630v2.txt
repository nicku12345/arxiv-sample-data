In this paper we introduce the elementary notion of Pl\"ucker form of a pair (E,S), where E is a vector bundle of rank r on a smooth, irreducible, complex projective variety X and S \subset H^0(E) is a subspace of dimension rm. We apply this notion to the study of theta map \theta_r on the moduli space SU_X(r,0) of semistable vector bundles of rank r and trivial determinant on a curve X of genus g. We prove that \theta_r is generically injective if X is general and g >> r.
