We verify the Morrison--Kawamata conjecture for a certain class of rational threefolds, namely blowups of P^3 in the base locus of a net of quadrics with no reducible members. This seems to be the first verified case of the conjecture for klt Calabi--Yau pairs in dimension 3 with non-zero boundary divisor.
