We describe polarized complexity-one T-varieties combinatorially in terms of so-called divisorial polytopes, and show how geometric properties of such a variety can be read off the corresponding divisorial polytope. We compare our description with other possible descriptions of polarized complexity-one T-varieties. We also describe how to explicitly find generators of affine complexity-one T-varieties.
