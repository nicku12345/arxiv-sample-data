Following an idea of Totaro, we prove that the classical integral cycle class map from algebraic cycles to \'etale cohomology factors through a quotient of \ell-adic \'etale cobordism over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. This shows that there is a strong topological obstruction for cohomology classes to be algebraic and that examples of Atiyah, Hirzebruch and Totaro also work in positive characteristic.
