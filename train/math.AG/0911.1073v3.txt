Let f:X\to Y be a surjective morphism of integral schemes. Then X is said to be quasi-galois closed over Y by f if X has a unique conjugate over Y in an algebraically closed field. Such a notion has been applied to the computation of \'etale fundamental groups.   In this paper we will use affine coverings with values in a fixed field to discuss quasi-galois closed and then give a sufficient and essential condition for quasi-galois closed. Here, we will avoid using affine structures on a scheme since their definition looks copious and fussy.
