We give a definition of tropical orbit spaces and their morphisms. We show that, under certain conditions, the weighted number of preimages of a point in the target of such a morphism does not depend on the choice of this point. We equip the moduli spaces of elliptic tropical curves with a structure of tropical orbit space and, using our results on tropical orbit spaces, simplify the known proof of the fact that the weighted number of plane elliptic tropical curves of degree d with fixed j-invariant which pass through 3d-1 points in general position in \RR^2 is independent of the choice of a configuration of points.
