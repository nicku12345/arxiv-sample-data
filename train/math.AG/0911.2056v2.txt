We prove that the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence for smooth proper tame Artin stacks in characteristic p (as defined by Abramovich, Olsson, and Vistoli) which lift mod p^2 degenerates. We push the result to the coarse spaces of such stacks, thereby obtaining a degeneracy result for schemes which are etale locally the quotient of a smooth scheme by a finite linearly reductive group scheme.
