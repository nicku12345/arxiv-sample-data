We generalize the classical Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem to the case of finite linearly reductive group schemes. As an application, we prove that every scheme X which is etale locally the quotient of a smooth scheme by a finite linearly reductive group scheme is the coarse space of a smooth tame Artin stack (as defined by Abramovich, Olsson, and Vistoli) whose stacky structure is supported on the singular locus of X.
