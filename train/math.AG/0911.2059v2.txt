We develop a theory of toric Artin stacks extending the theories of toric Deligne-Mumford stacks developed by Borisov-Chen-Smith, Fantechi-Mann-Nironi, and Iwanari. We also generalize the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem to the case of diagonalizable group schemes. These are both applications of our main theorem which shows that a toroidal embedding X is canonically the good moduli space (in the sense of Alper) of a smooth log smooth Artin stack whose stacky structure is supported on the singular locus of X.
