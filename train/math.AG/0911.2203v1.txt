This basic introduction to tropical geometry is hopefully accessible to a first years student in mathematics. The topics discussed here are basic tropical algebra, tropical plane curves, some tropical intersections, and Viro's patchworking.   I tried as much as possible to illustrate each new definition with concrete examples and nice pictures.   As the title suggests, this text is in French. A Portuguese (Brazil) version, as well as correction of exercises, can be found at http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~brugalle/largerpubli.html
