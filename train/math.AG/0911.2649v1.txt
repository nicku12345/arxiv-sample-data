In the first section of this article, we recall Keel's well-known presentation of Pic(\overline{\mathfrak{M}}_{0,n}) using irreducible boundary divisors of \overline{\mathfrak{M}}_{0,n} as generators, and describe a basis for Pic(\overline{\mathfrak{M}}_{0,n}) recently discovered by Keel and Gibney. In the second section, we present a theorem which gives an explicit and very simple expression for every boundary divisor in terms of this basis, thereby yielding a new presentation with a minimal set of relations.
