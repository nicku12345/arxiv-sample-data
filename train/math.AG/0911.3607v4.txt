A root system R of rank n defines an n-dimensional smooth projective toric variety X(R) associated with its fan of Weyl chambers. We give a simple description of the functor of X(R) in terms of the root system R and apply this result in the case of root systems of type A to give a new proof of the fact that the toric variety X(A_n) is the fine moduli space \bar{L}_{n+1} of stable (n+1)-pointed chains of projective lines investigated by Losev and Manin.
