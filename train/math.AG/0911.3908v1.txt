We consider the holomorphic unramified mapping of two arbitrary finite bordered Riemann surfaces. Extending the map to the doubles X_1 and X_2 of Riemann surfaces we define the vector bundle on the second double as a direct image of the vector bundle on first double. %% We choose line bundles of half-order differentials \Delta_1 and \Delta_2 so that the vector bundle V^{X_2}_{\chi_\ad} \otimes \Delta_2 on X_2 would be the direct image of the vector bundle V^{X_1}_{\chi_\ao} \otimes \Delta_1. We then show that the Hardy spaces H_{2, J_1(p)} (S_1,V_{\chi_\ao} \otimes \Delta_1) and H_{2,J_2(p)} (S_2,V_{\chi_\ad} \otimes \Delta_2) are isometrically isomorphic. Proving that we construct an explicit isometric isomorphism and a matrix representation \chi_\ad of the fundamental group \piod(X_2, p_0) given a matrix representation \chi_\ao of the fundamental group \piod(X_1, p'_0). %% On the basis of the results of \cite{vin} and Theorem \ref{theorem_1} proven in the present work we then conjecture that there exists a covariant functor from the category {\cal RH} of finite bordered surfaces with vector bundle and signature matrices to the category of Kre\u{\i}n spaces and isomorphisms which are ramified covering of Riemann surfaces.
