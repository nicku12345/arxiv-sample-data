We study the intersection of two particular Fermat hypersurfaces in \mathbb{P}^3 over a finite field. Using the Kani-Rosen decomposition we study arithmetic properties of this curve in terms of its quotients. Explicit computation of the quotients is done using a Gr\"obner basis algorithm. We also study the p-rank, zeta function, and number of rational points, of the modulo p reduction of the curve. We show that the Jacobian of the genus 2 quotient is (4,4)-split.
