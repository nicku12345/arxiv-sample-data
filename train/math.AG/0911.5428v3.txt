For each smooth Fano threefold X with Picard number 1 we consider a weak Landau--Ginzburg model, that is a fibration over \mathbb C^1 given by a certain Laurent polynomial. In the spirit of L. Katzarkov's program we prove that the number of irreducible components of the central fiber of its compactification is h^{1,2}(X)+1. In particular, it does not depend on the compactification. The question of dependence on the model is open; however we produce examples of different weak Landau--Ginzburg models for the same variety with the same number of components of the central fiber.
