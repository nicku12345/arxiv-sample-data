In this paper we partially address two issues:   - The first is a rigidity property for pairs (S,C) consisting of a general projective K3 surface S, and a curve C obtained as the normalization of a nodal, hyperplane section of S. We prove that a non-trivial deformation of such a pair (S,C) induces a non-trivial deformation of C;   - The second question concerns the Wahl map of curves C as above. We prove that the Wahl map of the normalization of a nodal curve contained in a general projective K3 surface is non-surjective.   In both cases, we impose upper bounds on the number of nodes of the hyperplane section.
