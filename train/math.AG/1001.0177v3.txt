Given a relatively minimal fibration f: S \to \Bbb P^1 on a rational surface S with general fiber C of genus g, we investigate under what conditions the inequality 6(g-1)\le K_f^2 occurs, where K_f is the canonical relative sheaf of f. We give sufficient conditions for having such inequality, depending on the genus and gonality of C and the number of certain exceptional curves on S. We illustrate how these results can be used for constructing fibrations with the desired property. For fibrations of genus 11\le g\le 49 we prove the inequality:  6(g-1) +4 -4\sqrt g \le K_f^2.
