We study a generalization of Lian-Liu-Yau's notion of Euler data in genus zero and show that certain sequences of multiplicative equivariant characteristic classes on Kontsevich's stable map moduli with markings induce data satisfying the generalization. In the case of one or two markings, this data is explicitly identified in terms of hypergeometric type classes, constituting a complete extension of Lian-Liu-Yau's mirror principle in genus zero to the case of two marked points and establishing a program for the general case. We give several applications involving the Euler class of obstruction bundles induced by a concavex bundle on P^n.
