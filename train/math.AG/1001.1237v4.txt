Effective reconstruction formulas of a curve from its theta hyperplanes are known classically in genus 2 (where the theta hyperplanes are Weierstrass points), and 3 (where, for a generic curve, the theta hyperplanes are bitangents to a plane quartic). However, for higher genera, no formula or algorithm are known. In this paper we give an explicit (and simple) algorithm for computing a generic genus 4 curve from it's theta hyperplanes.
