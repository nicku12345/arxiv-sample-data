We describe an efficient algorithm for the computation of separable isogenies between abelian varieties represented in the coordinate system given by algebraic theta functions. Let A be an abelian variety of dimension g defined over a field of odd characteristic. Our algorithm decomposes in two principal steps. First, given a theta null point for A and a subgroup K isotropic for the Weil pairing, we explain how to compute the theta null point corresponding to the quotient abelian variety A/K. Then, from the knowledge of a theta null point of A/K, we give an algorithm to obtain a rational expression for an isogeny from A to A/K. The algorithm resulting as the combination of these two steps can be viewed as a higher dimensional analog of the well known algorithm of V\'elu to compute isogenies between elliptic curves. In the case that K is isomorphic to (\Z / \ell \Z)^g for \ell \in \N^*, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is equivalent to O(\log \ell) additions in A and a constant number of \ell^{th} root extractions in the base field of A. In order to improve the efficiency of our algorithms, we introduce a compressed representation that allows to encode a point of level 4\ell of a g dimensional abelian variety using only g(g+1)/2\cdot 4^g coordinates. We also give formulas to compute the Weil and commutator pairings given input points in theta coordinates.
