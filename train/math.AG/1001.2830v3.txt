We study GIT quotients parametrizing n-pointed conics that generalize the GIT quotients (\mathbb{P}^1)^n//SL2. Our main result is that \overline{M}_{0,n} admits a morphism to each such GIT quotient, analogous to the well-known result of Kapranov for the simpler (\mathbb{P}^1)^n quotients. Moreover, these morphisms factor through Hassett's moduli spaces of weighted pointed rational curves, where the weight data comes from the GIT linearization data.
