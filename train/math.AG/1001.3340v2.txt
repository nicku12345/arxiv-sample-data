We explicitly find lower bounds on the volume of threefolds and fourfolds of general type in order to have nonvanishing of pluricanonical systems and birationality of pluricanonical maps. In the case of threefolds of large volume, we also give necessary and sufficient conditions for the fourth canonical map to be birational.
