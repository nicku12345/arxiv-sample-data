We classify six-dimensional exceptional quotient singularities and show that seven-dimensional exceptional quotient singularities do not exist. Inter alia we prove that the irreducible six-dimensional projective representation of the sporadic simple Hall--Janko group gives rise to an exceptional quotient singularity.
