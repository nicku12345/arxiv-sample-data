We define Enriques varieties as a higher dimensional generalization of Enriques surfaces and construct examples by using fixed point free automorphisms on generalized Kummer varieties. We also classify all automorphisms of generalized Kummer varieties that come from an automorphism of the underlying abelian surface.
