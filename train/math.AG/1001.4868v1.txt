In this paper, we define a generalized arithmetic-geometric mean \mu_g among 2^g terms motivated by 2\tau-formulas of theta constants. By using Thomae's formula, we give two expressions of \mu_g when initial terms satisfy some conditions. One is given in terms of period integrals of a hyperelliptic curve C of genus g. The other is by a period integral of a certain Calabi-Yau g-fold given as a double cover of the g-dimensional projective space \mathbf{P}^g.
