We discuss some properties of the extremal rays of the cone of effective curves of surfaces that are obtained by blowing up the projective plane at points in very general position. The main motivation is to rectify an incorrect interpretation, in terms of the geometry of this cone, of the Segre--Harbourne--Gimigliano--Hirschowitz conjecture. Even though the arguments are based on elementary computations, the point of view leads to observe some other properties of the Mori cone, among which the fact that in the case of ten or more points the cone is not countably generated.
