We present a survey on the recent progress with desingularization of quasi-excellent schemes of characteristic zero. Due to expository goals of the paper we concentrate on giving examples and outlining main ideas, and we refer to other sources for detailed proofs and technical details. This survey will be published in the proceedings of the conference "Motivic integration and its interactions with model theory and non-archimedean geometry" (ICMS, May 2008).
