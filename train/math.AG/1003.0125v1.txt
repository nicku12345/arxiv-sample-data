The theory of relative logarithmic jet spaces is developed for log schemes. With this theory the existence of bounds of intersection multiplicities of curves and divisors on certain log schemes is established. This result extends those of Noguchi and Winkelmann by replacing the semi-abelian condition by a differential one.
