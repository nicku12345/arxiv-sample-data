We study the Chow group of zero-cycles on singular varieties using the cdh topology. We define the cdh versions of the zero-cycles and albanese maps. We prove results comparing these groups for a singular variety with the similar groups on the resolution of singularities. We use these to prove some results about the known Chow group of zero-cycles on surfaces and threefolds and some cases of arbitrary dimension.
