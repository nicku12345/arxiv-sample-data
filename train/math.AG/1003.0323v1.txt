The classical polynomial interpolation problem in several variables can be generalized to the case of points with greater multiplicities. What is known, as yet, is essentially concentrated in the Alexander-Hirschowitz Theorem which says that a general collection of double points in P^r gives independent conditions on the linear system L of the hypersurfaces of degree d, with a well known list of exceptions. We present a new proof of this theorem which consists in performing degenerations of P^r and analyzing how L degenerates.
