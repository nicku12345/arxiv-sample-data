We call a local homeomorphism f: (R^n,0)\to(R^n,0) blow-analytic if it becomes real analytic after composing with a finite number blowings-up with smooth nowhere dense centers. If the graph of f is semi-algebraic then, by a theorem of Bierstone and Milman, f is blow-analytic if and only if it is arc-analytic: the image by f of a parametrized real analytic arc is again a real analytic arc.   For a semialgebraic homeomorphism f we show that if f is blow-analytic and the inverse of f is Lipschitz, then f is Lipschitz and the inverse of f is blow-analytic. The proof is by a motivic integration argument, using additive invariants on the spaces of arcs.
