This paper studies Artin-Tate motives over number rings. As a subcategory of geometric motives, the triangulated category of Artin-Tate motives DATM(S) is generated by motives of schemes that are finite over the base S. After establishing stability of these subcategories under pullback and pushforward along open and closed immersions, a motivic t-structure is constructed. Exactness properties of these functors familiar from perverse sheaves are shown to hold in this context. The cohomological dimension of mixed Artin-Tate motives is two, and there is an equivalence of the triangulated category of Artin-Tate motives with the derived category of mixed Artin-Tate motives.   Update in second version: a functorial and strict weight filtration for mixed Artin-Tate motives is established. Moreover, two minor corrections have been performed: first, the category of Artin-Tate motives is now defined to be the triangulated category generated by direct factors of f_* \mathbf 1(n)---as opposed to the thick category generated by these generators. Secondly, the exactness of f^* for a finite map is only stated for etale maps f.
