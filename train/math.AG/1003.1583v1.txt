Let N a compact complex submanifold of a compact complex manifold M. We say N splits in M, if the holomorphic tangent bundle sequence splits holomorphically. By a result of Mok a splitting submanifold of a Kaehler Einstein manifold with a projective structure is totally geodesic. The classification of all splitting submanifolds of families of fake elliptic curves given here completes the case of threefolds M with a projective structure by a previous result of the authors.
