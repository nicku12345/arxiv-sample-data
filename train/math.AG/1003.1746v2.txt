We study holomorphic function germs under equivalence relations that preserve an analytic variety. We show that two quasihomogeneous polynomials, not necessarily with isolated singularities, having isomorphic relative Milnor algebras are relative right equivalent. Under the condition that the module of vector fields tangent to the variety is finitely generated, we also show that the relative Tjurina algebra is a complete invariant for the classification of arbitrary function germs with respect to the relative contact equivalence. This is the relative version of a well known result by Mather and Yau.
