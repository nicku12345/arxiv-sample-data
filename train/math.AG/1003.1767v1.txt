In a family of curves, the Chern numbers of a singular fiber are the local contributions to the Chern numbers of the total space. We will give some inequalities between the Chern numbers of a singular fiber as well as their lower and upper bounds. We introduce the dual fiber of a singular fiber, and prove a duality theorem. As an application, we will classify singular fibers with large or small Chern numbers.
