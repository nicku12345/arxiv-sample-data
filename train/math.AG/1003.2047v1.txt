We investigate full strongly exceptional collections on smooth, com- plete toric varieties. We obtain explicit results for a large family of varieties with Picard number three, containing many of the families already known. We also describe the relations between the collections and the split of the push forward of the trivial line bundle by the toric Frobenius morphism.
