Floor diagrams are combinatorial objects which organize the count of tropical plane curves satisfying point conditions. In this paper we introduce Psi-floor diagrams which count tropical curves satisfying not only point conditions but also conditions given by Psi-classes (together with points). We then generalize our definition to relative Psi-floor diagrams and prove a Caporaso-Harris type formula for the corresponding numbers. This formula is shown to coincide with the classical Caporaso-Harris formula for relative plane descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. As a consequence, we can conclude that in our case relative descendant Gromov-Witten invariants equal their tropical counterparts.
