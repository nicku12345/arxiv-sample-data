We study perverse coherent sheaves on the resolution of rational double points. As examples, we consider rational double points on 2-dimensional moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 and elliptic surfaces. Then we show that perverse coherent sheaves appears in the theory of Fourier-Mukai transforms. As an application, we generalize the Fourier-Mukai duality for K3 surfaces to our situation.
