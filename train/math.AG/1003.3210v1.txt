We review some recent results and conjectures saying that, roughly speaking, periodic cyclic homology of a smooth non-commutative algebraic variety should carry all the additional "motivic" structures possessed by the usual de Rham cohomology of a smooth algebraic variety (specifically, an R-Hodge structure for varieties over R, and a filtered Dieudonne module structure for varieties over Z_p).
