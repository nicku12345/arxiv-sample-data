ACM rank 1 bundles on del Pezzo surfaces are classified in terms of the rational normal curves that they contain. A complete list of ACM line bundles is provided. Moreover, for any del Pezzo surface X of degree less or equal than six and for any n\geq 2 we construct a family of dimension \geq n-1 of non-isomorphic simple ACM bundles of rank n on X.
