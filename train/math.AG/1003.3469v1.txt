This note describes minimal surfaces S of general type satisfying p_g\geq 5 and K^2=2p_g. For p_g\geq 8 the canonical map of such surfaces is generically finite of degree 2 and the bulk of the paper is a complete characterization of such surfaces with non birational canonical map. It turns out that if p_g\geq 13, S has always an (unique) genus 2 fibration, whose non 2-connected fibres can be characterized, whilst for p_g\leq 12 there are two other classes of such surfaces with non birational canonical map.
