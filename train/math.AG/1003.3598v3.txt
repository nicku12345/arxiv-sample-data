Let A be an Artinian local ring with algebraically closed residue field k, and let \mathbf{G} be an affine smooth group scheme over A. The Greenberg functor \mathcal{F} associates to \mathbf{G} a linear algebraic group G:=(\mathcal{F}\mathbf{G})(k) over k, such that G\cong\mathbf{G}(A). We prove that if \mathbf{G} is a reductive group scheme over A, and \mathbf{T} is a maximal torus of \mathbf{G}, then T is a Cartan subgroup of G, and every Cartan subgroup of G is obtained uniquely in this way. The proof is based on establishing a Nullstellensatz analogue for smooth affine schemes with reduced fibre over A, and that the Greenberg functor preserves certain normaliser group schemes over A. Moreover, we prove that if \mathbf{G} is reductive and \mathbf{P} is a parabolic subgroup of \mathbf{G}, then P is a self-normalising subgroup of G, and if \mathbf{B} and \mathbf{B}' are two Borel subgroups of \mathbf{G}, then the corresponding subgroups B and B' are conjugate in G.
