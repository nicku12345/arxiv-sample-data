We show that for \alpha \in (2/3, 7/10), the log canonical model \bar M_4(\alpha) of the pair (\bar M_4, \alpha \delta) is isomorphic to the moduli space \bar M_4^{hs} of h-semistable curves, and that there is a birational morphism \Xi: \bar M_4^{hs} \to \bar M_4(2/3) that contracts the locus of curves C_1\cup_p C_2 consisting of genus two curves meeting in a node p such that p is a Weierstrass point of C_1 or C_2. To obtain this morphism, we construct a compact moduli space \bar M_{2,1}^{hs} of pointed genus two curves that have nodes, ordinary cusps and tacnodes as singularity, and prove that it is isomorphic to Rulla's flip constructed in his thesis.
