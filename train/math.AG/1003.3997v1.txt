It is known after Jouanolou that a general holomorphic foliation of degree \geq2 in projective space has no algebraic leaf. We give formulas for the degrees of the subvarieties of the parameter space of one-dimensional foliations that correspond to foliations endowed with some invariant subvariety of degree 1 or 2 and dimension \geq1.
