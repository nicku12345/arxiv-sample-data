Let F be a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in m+1 variables defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and suppose that F belongs to the s-th secant varieties of the standard Veronese variety X_{m,d}\subset \mathbb{P}^{{m+d\choose d}-1} but that its minimal decomposition as a sum of d-th powers of linear forms M_1, ..., M_r is F=M_1^d+... + M_r^d with r>s. We show that if s+r\leq 2d+1 then such a decomposition of F can be split in two parts: one of them is made by linear forms that can be written using only two variables, the other part is uniquely determined once one has fixed the first part. We also obtain a uniqueness theorem for the minimal decomposition of F if the rank is at most d and a mild condition is satisfied.
