Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and let H_G(d,N) be the open locus of the Hilbert scheme H(d,N) corresponding to Gorenstein subschemes of degree d in the projective N-space. We proved in a previous paper that H_G(d,N) is irreducible for d\le9 and N\ge1. In the present paper we prove that also H_G(10,N) is irreducible for each N\ge1, giving also a complete description of its singular locus.
