In our previous papers, we investigated a lower bound for the second sectional geometric genus g_{2}(X,L) of n-dimensional polarized manifolds (X,L) and by using these, we studied the dimension of global sections of K_{X}+tL with t\geq 2. In this paper, we consider the case where (X,L) is a quasi-polarized manifold. First we will prove g_{2}(X,L)\geq h^{1}(\mathcal{O}_{X}) for the following cases: (a) n=3, \kappa(X)=-\infty and \kappa(K_{X}+L)\geq 0. (b) n\geq 3 and \kappa(X)\geq 0. Moreover, by using this inequality, we will study h^{0}(K_{X}+tL) for the case where (X,L) is a quasi-polarized 3-fold.
