We describe some one-dimensional moduli spaces of rank 2 Gieseker semistable sheaves on an Enriques surface improving earlier results of H. Kim. In case of a nodal Enriques surface the obtained moduli spaces are reducible for general polarizations. For unnodal Enriques surfaces we show how to reduce the study of moduli spaces of high even rank Gieseker semistable sheaves to low ranks. To prove this we use the method of K. Yoshioka who showed that in the odd rank one can reduce to rank 1.
