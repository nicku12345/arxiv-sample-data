We give formulas for the degrees of the spaces of foliations in P2 with a dicritical singularity of prescribed order. Blowing up such singularity induces, generically, a foliation with all but finitely many leaves transversal to the exceptional line; we also find the degree of the locus defined by imposing a leaf of total contact with the exceptional line.
