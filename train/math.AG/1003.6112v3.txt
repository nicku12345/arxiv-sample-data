Special kinds of rank 2 vector bundles with (possibly irregular) connections on P^1 are considered. We construct an equivalence between the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of such bundles and the derived category of modules over a TDO ring on certain non-separated curve. We identify this curve with the coarse moduli space of some parabolic bundles on P^1. Then our equivalence becomes an example of the categorical Langlands correspondence.
