The original Fujita approximation theorem states that the volume of a big divisor D on a projective variety X can always be approximated arbitrarily closely by the self-intersection number of an ample divisor on a birational modification of X. One can also formulate it in terms of graded linear series as follows: let W_{\bullet} = \{W_k \} be the complete graded linear series associated to a big divisor D: \[   W_k = H^0\big(X,\mathcal{O}_X(kD)\big). \] For each fixed positive integer p, define W^{(p)}_{\bullet} to be the graded linear subseries of W_{\bullet} generated by W_p: \[   W^{(p)}_{m}={cases}   0, &\text{if p\nmid m;}   \mathrm{Image} \big(S^k W_p \rightarrow W_{kp} \big), &\text{if m=kp.}   {cases} \] Then the volume of W^{(p)}_{\bullet} approaches the volume of W_{\bullet} as p\to\infty. We will show that, under this formulation, the Fujita approximation theorem can be generalized to the case of multigraded linear series.
