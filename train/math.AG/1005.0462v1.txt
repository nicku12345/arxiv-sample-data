This article concerns the geometry of torsors under an elliptic curve. Let \OO_K be a complete discrete valuation ring with algebraically closed residue field and function field K. Let \pi be a generator of the maximal ideal of \OO_K, and S=\mathrm{Spec}(\OO_K). Suppose that we are given J_K an elliptic curve over K, with J the connected component of the S-N?ron model of J_K. Given X_K/K a torsor of order d under J_K, let X be the S-minimal regular proper model. Then there is an invertible id?al \mathcal{I}\subset \OO_K such that \mathcal{I}^{d}=\pi\OO_X\subset \OO_X. Moreover, there exists a canonical morphism q:\Pic^{\circ}_{X/S}\rightarrow J which induces a surjective map q(S):\Pic^{\circ}(X)\rightarrow J(S). The purpose of the article is to prove this last morphism q(S) is compatible with respect to the \mathcal{I}-adic filtration on \Pic^{\circ}(X), and the \pi-adic filtration on J(S). As a byproduct, we obtain {\textquotedblleft Herbrand functions\textquotedblright}, similar to those Serre used in his description of local class fields (\cite{Serre})
