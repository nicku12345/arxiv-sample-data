This paper obtains criteria for a Fano variety X with normal crossing singularities defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, to be smoothable. The difference with the original version is that the theory of logarithmic structures and deformations is used in order to prove that X is smoothable by a smooth variety, if and only if T^1(X)=O_D, where D is the singular locus of X.
