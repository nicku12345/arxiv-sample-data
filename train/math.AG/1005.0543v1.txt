For an embedding of sufficiently high degree of a smooth projective variety X into projective space, we use residues to define a filtered holonomic D-module (M, F) on the dual projective space. This gives a concrete description of the intermediate extension to a Hodge module on P of the variation of Hodge structure on the middle-dimensional cohomology of the hyperplane sections of X. We also establish many results about the sheaves F_k M, such as positivity, vanishing theorems, or reflexivity.
