Given a morphism between smooth projective varieties f: W \to X, we study whether f-relatively free rational curves imply the existence of f-relatively very free rational curves. The answer is shown to be positive when the fibers of the map f have Picard number 1 and a further smoothness assumption is imposed. The main application is when X \subset \PP^n is a smooth complete intersection of type (d_1, ..., d_c) and \sum d_i^2 \leq n. In this case, we take W to be the space of pointed lines contained in X and the positive answer to the question implies that X contains very twisting ruled surfaces and is strongly rationally simply connected. If the fibers of a smooth family of varieties over a 2-dimensional base satisfy these conditions and the Brauer obstruction vanishes, then the family has a rational section (see \cite{dJHS})
