Let f(\bfz,\bar\bfz) be a mixed strongly polar homogeneous polynomial of 3 variables \bfz=(z_1,z_2, z_3). It defines a Riemann surface V:=\{[\bfz]\in \BP^{2}\,|\,f(\bfz,\bar\bfz)=0 \} in the complex projective space \BP^{2}. We will show that for an arbitrary given g\ge 0, there exists a mixed polar homogeneous polynomial with polar degree 1 which defines a projective surface of genus g. For the construction, we introduce a new type of weighted homogeneous polynomials which we call {\em polar weighted homogeneous polynomials of twisted join type}.
