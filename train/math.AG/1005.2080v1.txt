The paper investigates the non-vanishing of H^1(E(n)), where E is a (normalized) rank two vector bundle over any smooth irreducible threefold X of degree d such that Pic(X) \cong \ZZ. If \epsilon is the integer defined by the equality \omega_X = O_X(\epsilon), and \alpha is the least integer t such that H^0(E(t)) \ne 0, then, for a non-stable E (\alpha \le 0) the first cohomology module does not vanish at least between the endpoints \frac{\epsilon-c_1}{2} and -\alpha-c_1-1. The paper also shows that there are other non-vanishing intervals, whose endpoints depend on \alpha and also on the second Chern class c_2 of E. If E is stable the first cohomology module does not vanish at least between the endpoints \frac{\epsilon-c_1}{2} and \alpha-2. The paper considers also the case of a threefold X with Pic(X) \ne \ZZ but Num(X) \cong \ZZ and gives similar non-vanishing results.
