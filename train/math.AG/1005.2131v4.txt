It has long been known that to a complex cubic surface or threefold one can canonically associate a principally polarized abelian variety. We give a construction which works for cubics over an arithmetic base. This answers, away from the prime 2, an old question of Deligne and a recent question of Kudla and Rapoport. We further classify the Mumford-Tate groups of the abelian varieties which arise, and give additional arithmetic applications.
