Let {\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}^\alpha_s be a moduli space of stable parabolic vector bundles of rank n \geq 2 and fixed determinant of degree d over a compact connected Riemann surface X of genus g(X) \geq 2. If g(X) = 2, then we assume that n > 2. Let m denote the greatest common divisor of d, n and the dimensions of all the successive quotients of the quasi-parabolic filtrations. We prove that the cohomological Brauer group {\rm Br}({\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}^\alpha_s) is isomorphic to the cyclic group {\mathbb Z}/ m{\mathbb Z}. We also show that {\rm Br}({\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}^\alpha_s) is generated by the Brauer class of the projective bundle over {\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}^\alpha_s obtained by restricting the universal projective bundle over X\times {\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}^\alpha_s. We also prove that there is a universal vector bundle over X\times {\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}^\alpha_s if and only if m=1.
