Let \mhu be the moduli space of semi-stable pure sheaves of class u on a smooth complex projective surface X. We specify u=(0,L,\chi(u)=0), i.e. sheaves in u are of dimension 1. There is a natural morphism \pi from the moduli space \mhu to the linear system \ls. We study a series of determinant line bundles \lcn on \mhu via \pi. Denote g_L the arithmetic genus of curves in \ls. For any X and g_L\leq0, we compute the generating function Z^r(t)=\sum_{n}h^0(\mhu,\lcn)t^n. For X being \mathbb{P}^2 or \mathbb{P}(\mo_{\pone}\oplus\mo_{\pone}(-e)) with e=0,1, we compute Z^1(t) for g_L>0 and Z^r(t) for all r and g_L=1,2. Our results provide a numerical check to Strange Duality in these specified situations, together with G\"ottsche's computation. And in addition, we get an interesting corollary in the theory of compactified Jacobian of integral curves.
