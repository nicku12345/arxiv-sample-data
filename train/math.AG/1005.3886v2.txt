This note aims to improve known numerical bounds proved earlier by Chen \cite{PAMS} and Chen-Hacon \cite{Chen-Hacon} and to present some new examples of smooth minimal 3-folds canonically fibred by surfaces (resp. curves) of geometric genus as large as 19 (resp. 13). As an interesting by-product, we present a new class of general type surfaces which are canonically fibred by curves of genus 13.
