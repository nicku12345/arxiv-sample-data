We show that for a smooth hypersurface X\subset \bbP^n of degree at least 2, there exist arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM) codimension two subvarieties Y\subset X which are not an intersection X\cap{S} for a codimension two subvariety S\subset\bbP^n. We also show there exist Y\subset X as above for which the normal bundle sequence for the inclusion Y\subset X\subset\bbP^n does not split.
