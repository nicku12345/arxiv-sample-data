Let X be a surface of degree n, projected onto \mathbb{CP}^2. The surface has a natural Galois cover with Galois group S_n. It is possible to determine the fundamental group of a Galois cover from that of the complement of the branch curve of X. In this paper we survey the fundamental groups of Galois covers of all surfaces of small degree n \leq 4, that degenerate to a nice plane arrangement, namely a union of n planes such that no three planes meet in a line. We include the already classical examples of the quadric, the Hirzebruch and the Veronese surfaces and the degree 4 embedding of \mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{CP}^1, and also add new computations for the remaining cases: the cubic embedding of the Hirzebruch surface F_1, the Cayley cubic (or a smooth surface in the same family), for a quartic surface that degenerates to the union of a triple point and a plane not through the triple point, and for a quartic 4-point. In an appendix, we also include the degree 8 surface \mathbb{CP}^1\times \mathbb{CP}^1 embedded by the (2,2) embedding, and the degree 2n surface embedded by the (1,n) embedding, in order to complete the classification of all embeddings of \mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{CP}^1, which was begun in \cite{15}.
