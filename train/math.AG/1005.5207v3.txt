We show that the compatibility of the relative canonical sheaf with base change fails generally in families of normal varieties. Furthermore, it always fails if the general fiber of a family of pure dimension n is Cohen-Macaulay and the special fiber contains a strictly S_{n-1} point. In particular, in moduli spaces with functorial relative canonical sheaves Cohen-Macaulay schemes can not degenerate to S_{n-1} schemes. Another, less immediate consequence is that the canonical sheaf of an S_{n-1}, G_2 scheme of pure dimension n is not S_3.
