In [DW05] and [DW07], C. Deninger and A. Werner developed a partial p-adic analogue of the classical Narasimhan-Seshadri correspondence between vector bundles and representations of the fundamental group. We will investigate the various monodromy groups that occur in this theory, that is the image of these representations and their Zariski closure as well as the Tannaka dual group of these vector bundles.
