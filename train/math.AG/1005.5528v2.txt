In this note we describe a unique linear embedding of a prime Fano 4-fold F of genus 10 into the Grassmannian G(3,6). We use this to construct some moduli spaces of bundles on linear sections of F. In particular the moduli space of bundles with Mukai vector (3,L,3) on a generic polarized K3 surface (S,L) of genus 10 is constructed as a double cover of the projective plane branched over a smooth sextic.
