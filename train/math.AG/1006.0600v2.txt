In this article, we study the topology of real analytic germs F \colon (\C^3,0) \to (\C,0) given by F(x,y,z)=\overline{xy}(x^p+y^q)+z^r with p,q,r \in \N, p,q,r \geq 2 and (p,q)=1. Such a germ gives rise to a Milnor fibration \frac{F}{\mid F \mid} \colon \Sp^5\setminus L_F \to \Sp^1. We describe the link L_F as a Seifert manifold and we show that in many cases the open-book decomposition of \Sp^5 given by the Milnor fibration of F cannot come from the Milnor fibration of a complex singularity in \C^3.
