In this paper we investigate when the generic member of a family of K3 surfaces admitting a non--symplectic automorphism of finite order admits also a symplectic automorphism of the same order. We give a complete answer to this question if the order of the automorphism is a prime number and we provide several examples and partial results otherwise. Moreover we prove that, under certain conditions, a K3 surface admitting a non--symplectic automorphism of prime odd order, p, also admits a non--symplectic automorphism of order 2p. This generalizes a previous result by J. Dillies for p=3.
