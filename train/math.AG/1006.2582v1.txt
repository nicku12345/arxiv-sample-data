The perverse filtration in cohomology and in cohomology with compact supports is interpreted in terms of kernels of restrictions maps to suitable subvarieties by using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and spectral objects. Various mixed-Hodge-theoretic consequences for intersection cohomology and for the decomposition theorem are derived.
