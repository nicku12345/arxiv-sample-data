Suppose that g > 2, that n > 0 and that m > 0. In this paper we show that if E is an irreducible smooth variety which dominates a divisor D in M_{g,n}[m], the moduli space of n-pointed, smooth curves of genus g with a level m structure, then the closure of the image of the monodromy representation pi_1(E,e)--> Sp_g(Zhat) has finite index in Sp_g(Zhat). A similar result is proved for codimension 1 families of the universal principally polarized abelian variety of dimension g > 2. Both results are deduced from a general "non-abelian strictness theorem". The first result is used in arXiv:1001.5008 to control the Galois cohomology of the function field of M_{g,n}[m] in degrees 1 and 2.
