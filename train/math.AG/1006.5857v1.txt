We consider complex projective schemes X\subset\Bbb{P}^{r} defined by quadratic equations and satisfying a technical hypothesis on the fibres of the rational map associated to the linear system of quadrics defining X. Our assumption is related to the syzygies of the defining equations and, in particular, it is weaker than properties N_2, N_{2,2} and K_2. In this setting, we show that the degree, d, of X\subset\Bbb{P}^{r} is bounded by a function of its codimension, c, whose asymptotic behaviour is given by {2^c}/{\sqrt[4]{\pi c}}, thus improving the obvious bound d\leq 2^c. More precisely, we get the bound \binom{d}{2}\leq\binom{2c-1}{c-1}. Furthermore, if X satisfies property N_p or N_{2,p} we obtain the better bound \binom{d+2-p}{2}\leq\binom{2c+3-2p}{c+1-p}. Some classification results are also given when equality holds.
