Let A be an abelian variety over a finite field k. The k-isogeny class of A is uniquely determined by the Weil polynomial f_A. We assume that f_A is separable. For a given prime number \ell\neq\mathrm{char}\, k we give a classification of group schemes B[\ell], where B runs through the isogeny class, in terms of certain Newton polygons associated to f_A. As an application we classify zeta functions of Kummer surfaces over k.
