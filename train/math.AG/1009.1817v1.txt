It is well-known that the Eulerian polynomials, which count permutations in S_n by their number of descents, give the h-polynomial/h-vector of the simple polytopes known as permutohedra, the convex hull of the S_n-orbit for a generic weight in the weight lattice of S_n. Therefore the Eulerian polynomials give the Betti numbers for certain smooth toric varieties associated with the permutohedra.   In this paper we derive recurrences for the h-vectors of a family of polytopes generalizing this. The simple polytopes we consider arise as the orbit of a non-generic weight, namely a weight fixed by only the simple reflections J=\{s_{n},s_{n-1},s_{n-2} \cdots,s_{n-k+2},s_{n-k+1}\} for some k with respect to the A_n root lattice. Furthermore, they give rise to certain rationally smooth toric varieties X(J) that come naturally from the theory of algebraic monoids. Using effectively the theory of reductive algebraic monoids and the combinatorics of simple polytopes, we obtain a recurrence formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial of X(J) in terms of the Eulerian polynomials.
