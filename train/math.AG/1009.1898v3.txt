We construct the Kuranishi spaces, or in other words, the versal deformations, for the following classes of connections with fixed divisor of poles D: all such connections, as well as for its subclasses of integrable, integrable logarithmic and integrable logarithmic connections with a parabolic structure over D . The tangent and obstruction spaces of deformation theory are defined as the hypercohomology of an appropriate complex of sheaves, and the Kuranishi space is a fiber of the formal obstruction map.
