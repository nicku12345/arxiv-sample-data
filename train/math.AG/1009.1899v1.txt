We provide a sketch of the GIT construction of the moduli spaces for the three classes of connections: the class of meromorphic connections with fixed divisor of poles D and its subclasses of integrable and integrable logarithmic connections. We use the Luna Slice Theorem to represent the germ of the moduli space as the quotient of the Kuranishi space by the automorphism group of the central fiber. This method is used to determine the singularities of the moduli space of connections in some examples.
