Let X be an irreducible smooth complex projective curve of genus at least 3. Fix a line bundle L on X. Let M_{Sp}(L) be the moduli space of symplectic bundles (E, ExE ---> L) on X, with the symplectic form taking values in L. We show that the automorphism group of M_{Sp}(L) is generated by automorphisms sending E to ExM, where M is a 2-torsion line bundle, and automorphisms induced by automorphisms of X.
