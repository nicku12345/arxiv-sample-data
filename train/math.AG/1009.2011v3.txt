Let X be a Hilbert modular variety and \mathbb{V} a non-trivial local system over X with infinite monodromy. In this paper we study Saito's mixed Hodge structure (MHS) on the cohomology group H^k(X,\mathbb{V}) using the method of Higgs bundles. Among other results we prove the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism, give a dimension formula for the Hodge numbers and show that the mixed Hodge structure is split over \mathbb{R}. These results are analogous to Matsushima-Shimura [Annals of Mathematics 78, 1963] in the cocompact case and complement the results in Freitag [Book: Hilbert modular forms, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1990] for constant coefficients.
