Some of the 95 families of weighted K3 hypersurfaces have been known to have the isometric lattice polarizations. It is shown that weighted K3 hypersurfaces in such families are to one-to-one correspond by explicitly constructing the monomial birational morphisms among the weighted projective spaces. All the weight systems having the isometric Picard lattices commonly possess an anticanonical sublinear system, being confirmed that the Picard lattice of the sublinear system we obtained is the same as those of the complete linear systems.
