It is well known that the Hodge conjecture with rational coefficients holds for degree 2n-2 classes on complex projective n-folds. In this paper we study the more precise question if on a rationally connected complex projective n-fold the integral Hodge classes of degree 2n-2 are generated over \mathbb Z by classes of curves. We combine techniques from the theory of singularities of pairs on the one hand and infinitesimal variation of Hodge structures on the other hand to give an affirmative answer to this question for a large class of manifolds including Fano fourfolds. In the last case, one step in the proof is the following result of independent interest: There exist anticanonical divisors with isolated canonical singularities on a smooth Fano fourfold.
