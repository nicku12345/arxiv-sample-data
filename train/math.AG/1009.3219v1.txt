In this paper, we develop the theory of flashes of an algebraic curve. We show that the theory is birationally invariant in a sense which we will make more precise below. We also show how the theory provides a foundation for the method of asymptotic degenerations, a particular class of degenerations of plane projective algebraic curves. In particular, we consider the geometrical technique in relation to the Severi problem of degenerating nodal curves to lines in general position, and correct Severi's original proof of his conjecture.
