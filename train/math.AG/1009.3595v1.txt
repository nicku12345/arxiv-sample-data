We work over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic zero. A G-cover of {\mathbb P}^1 ramified at three points allows one to assign to each finite dimensional representation V of G a vector bundle \oplus \mathscr{O}(s_i) on {\mathbb P}^1 with parabolic structure at the ramification points. This produces a tensor functor from representation of G to vector bundles with parabolic structure that characterises the original cover. This work attempts to describe this tensor functor in terms of group theoretic data. More precisely, we construct a pullback functor on vector bundles with parabolic structure and describe the parabolic pullback of the previously described tensor functor.
