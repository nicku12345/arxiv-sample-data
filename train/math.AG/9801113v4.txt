Let X be a complete algebraic variety over {\bf C}. We consider a log variety (X,\Delta) that is weakly Kawamata log terminal. We assume that K_X+\Delta is a {\bf Q}-Cartier {\bf Q}-divisor and that every irreducible component of \lfloor \Delta \rfloor is {\bf Q}-Cartier. A nef and big Cartier divisor H on X is called {\it nef and log big} on (X,\Delta) if H |_B is nef and big for every center B of non-"Kawamata log terminal" singularities for (X,\Delta). We prove that, if L is a nef Cartier divisor such that aL-(K_X+\Delta) is nef and log big on (X,\Delta) for some a \in {\bf N}, then the complete linear system | mL | is base point free for m \gg 0.
