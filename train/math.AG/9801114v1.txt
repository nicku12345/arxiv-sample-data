We give an algorithm to compute the following cohomology groups on U = \C^n \setminus V(f) for any non-zero polynomial f \in \Q[x_1, ..., x_n]; 1. H^k(U, \C_U), \C_U is the constant sheaf on U with stalk \C. 2. H^k(U, \Vsc), \Vsc is a locally constant sheaf of rank 1 on U. We also give partial results on computation of cohomology groups on U for a locally constant sheaf of general rank and on computation of H^k(\C^n \setminus Z, \C) where Z is a general algebraic set. Our algorithm is based on computations of Gr\"obner bases in the ring of differential operators with polynomial coefficients.
