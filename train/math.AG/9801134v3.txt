The aim of this note is a combinatorial description of a category of D-modules over an affine space, smooth along the stratification defined by an arrangement of hyperplanes. These D-modules are assumed to satisfy certain non-resonance condition. The main result, see Theorem 4.1, generalizes [S.Khoroshkin, D-modules over arrangements of hyperplanes, Comm. in Alg. 23(9) (1995), 3481-3504].
