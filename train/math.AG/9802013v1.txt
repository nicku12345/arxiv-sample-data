Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is an important invariant of projective algebraic varieties. A well known conjecture due to Eisenbud and Goto gives a bound for regularity in terms of the codimension and degree. This conjecture is known to be true for curves (Gruson-Lazarsfeld-Peskine) and smooth surfaces (Pinkham, Lazarsfeld), but not in general.   The purpose of this paper is to give new bounds for the regularity of smooth varieties in dimensions 3 and 4 that are only slightly worse than the optimal ones suggested by the conjecture. Our method yields new bounds up to dimension 14, but as they get progressively worse for higher dimensions, we have not written them down here.
