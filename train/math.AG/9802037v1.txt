We describe the Hilbert scheme components parametrizing lines and conics on the space of determinantal nets of conics, N. As an application, we use the quantum Lefschetz hyperplane principle to compute the instanton numbers of rational curves on a complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefold in N. We also compute the number of lines and conics on some Calabi-Yau sections of non-decomposable vector bundles on N. The paper contains a brief summary of the A-model theory leading up to Givental-Kim's quantum Lefschetz hyperplane principle.
