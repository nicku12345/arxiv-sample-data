This note is a continuation of our paper with E. Zaslow "Categorical mirror symmetry: the elliptic curve", math.AG/9801119. We compare some triple Massey products on elliptic curve with the corresponding Fukaya products on the symplectic torus and recover the classical identity due to Kronecker. We also compute some triple Fukaya products such that the corresponding Massey products are not correctly defined.
