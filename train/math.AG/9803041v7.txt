The aim of this note is to define certain sheaves of vertex algebras on smooth manifolds. For each smooth complex algebraic (or analytic) manifold X, we construct a sheaf \Omega^{ch}_X, called the {\bf chiral de Rham complex} of X. It is a sheaf of vertex algebras in the Zarisky (or classical) topology, It comes equipped with a \BZ-grading by {\it fermionic charge}, and the {\it chiral de Rham differential} d_{DR}^{ch}, which is an endomorphism of degree 1 such that (d_{DR}^{ch})^2=0. One has a canonical embedding of the usual de Rham complex (\Omega_X, d_{DR})\hra (\Omega_X^{ch}, d_{DR}^{ch}) which is a quasiisomorphism.   If X is Calabi-Yau then this sheaf admits an N=2 supersymmetry. For some X (for example, for curves or for the flag spaces G/B), one can construct also a purely even analogue of this sheaf, a {\it chiral structure sheaf} \CO^{ch}_X. For the projective line, the space of global sections of the last sheaf is the irreducible vacuum \hsl(2)-module on the critical level.
