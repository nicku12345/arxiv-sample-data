We introduce motivic analogues of p-adic exponential integrals. We prove a basic multiplicativity property from which we deduce a motivic analogue of the Thom-Sebastiani Theorem. In particular, we obtain a new proof of the Thom-Sebastiani Theorem for the Hodge spectrum of (non isolated) singularities of functions.
