In this note, we would like to propose a suitable extension of the arithmetic Chow group of codimension one, in which the Hodge index theorem holds. We also prove an arithmetic analogue of Bogomolov's instability theorem for rank 2 vector bundles on arbitrary regular projective arithmetic varieties.
