In this paper we prove that the Gorenstein cyclic quotient singularities of type \frac 1l (1,..., 1,l-(r-1)) with l\geq r\geq 2, have a \textit{unique}torus-equivariant projective, crepant, partial resolution, which is ``full'' iff either l\equiv 0 mod % (r-1)  or l\equiv 1 mod (r-1) . As it turns out, if one of these two conditions is fulfilled, then the exceptional locus of the full desingularization consists of \lfloor \frac{l}{r-1} \rfloor prime divisors, \lfloor \frac{l}{r-1}\rfloor - 1 of which are isomorphic to the total spaces of \Bbb{P}_{\Bbb{C}}^1-bundles over \Bbb{P}_{\Bbb{C}%}^{r-2}. Moreover, it is shown that intersection numbers are computable explicitly and that the resolution morphism can be viewed as a composite of successive (normalized) blow-ups. Obviously, the monoparametrized singularity-series of the above type contains (as its ``first member'') the well-known Gorenstein singularity defined by the origin of the affine cone which lies over the r-tuple Veronese embedding of \Bbb{P}_{\Bbb{C}}^{r-1}.
