In this paper we propose and discuss a mirror construction for complete intersections in partial flag manifolds F(n_1, ..., n_l, n). This construction includes our previous mirror construction for complete intersection in Grassmannians and the mirror construction of Givental for complete flag manifolds. The key idea of our construction is a degeneration of F(n_1, ..., n_l, n) to a certain Gorenstein toric Fano variety P(n_1, ..., n_l, n) which has been investigated by Gonciulea and Lakshmibai. We describe a natural small crepant desingularization of P(n_1, ..., n_l, n) and prove a generalized version of a conjecture of Gonciulea and Lakshmibai on the singular locus of P(n_1, ..., n_l, n).
