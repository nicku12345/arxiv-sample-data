Let A be a noetherian ring and R_A be the graded ring A[X,Y,Z,T]. In this article we introduce the notion of a triad, which is a generalization to families of curves in {\bf P}^3_A of the notion of Rao module. A triad is a complex of graded R_A-modules (L_1 \to L_0 \to L_{-1}) with certain finiteness hypotheses on its cohomology modules.   A pseudo-isomorphism between two triads is a morphism of complexes which induces an isomorphism on the functors  h_0 (L\otimes .) and a monomorphism on the functors h_{-1} (L\otimes .). One says that two triads are pseudo-isomorphic if they are connected by a chain of pseudo-isomorphisms.   We show that to each family of curves is associated a triad, unique up to pseudo-isomorphism, and we show that the map \{\hbox{families of curves}\}\to \{\hbox{triads}\} has almost all the good properties of the map \{\hbox{curves}\}\to \{\hbox{Rao modules}\}.   In a section of examples, we show how to construct triads and families of curves systematically starting from a graded module and a sub-quotient (that is a submodule of a quotient module), and we apply these results to show the connectedness of H_{4,0}.
