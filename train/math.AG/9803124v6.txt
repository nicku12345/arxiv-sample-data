Let G be a semisimple complex Lie group with a Borel subgroup B. Let X=G/B be the flag manifold of G. Let C=P^1\ni\infty be the projective line. Let \alpha\in H_2(X,{\Bbb Z}). The moduli space of G-monopoles of topological charge \alpha (see e.g. [Jarvis]) is naturally identified with the space M_b(X,\alpha) of based maps from (C,\infty) to (X,B) of degree \alpha. The moduli space of G-monopoles carries a natural hyperk\"ahler structure, and hence a holomorphic symplectic structure. We propose a simple explicit formula for the symplectic structure on M_b(X,\alpha). It generalizes the well known formula for G=SL_2 (see e.g. [Atiyah-Hitchin]). Let P\supset B be a parabolic subgroup. The construction of the Poisson structure on M_b(X,\alpha) generalizes verbatim to the space of based maps M=M_b(G/P,\beta). In most cases the corresponding map T^*M\to TM is not an isomorphism, i.e. M splits into nontrivial symplectic leaves. These leaves are explicilty described.
