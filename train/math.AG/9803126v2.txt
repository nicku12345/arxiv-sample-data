The recent two proofs for the (weak) factorization theorem for birational maps, one by W{\l}odarczyk and the other by Abramovich-Karu-Matsuki-W{\l}odarczyk rely on the results of Morelli. The former uses the process for \pi-desingularization (the most subtle part of Morelli's combinatorial algorithm), while the latter uses the strong factorization of toric (toroidal) birational maps directly. This paper provides a coherent account of Morelli's work (and its toroidal extension) clarifying some discrepancies in the original argument.
