Chisini's conjecture asserts that for a cuspidal curve B\subset \mathbb P^2 a generic morphism f of a smooth projective surface onto \mathbb P^2 of degree \geq 5, branched along B, is unique up to isomorphism. We prove that if \deg f is greater than the value of some function depending on the degree, genus, and number of cusps of B, then the Chisini conjecture holds for B. This inequality holds for many different generic morphisms. In particular, it holds for a generic morphism given by a linear subsystem of the mth canonical class for almost all surfaces with ample canonical class.
