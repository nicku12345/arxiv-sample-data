In this article we address the problem of computing the dimension of the space of plane curves of degree d with n general points of multiplicity m. A conjecture of Harbourne and Hirschowitz implies that when d \geq 3m, the dimension is equal to the expected dimension given by the Riemann-Roch Theorem. Also, systems for which the dimension is larger than expected should have a fixed part containing a multiple (-1)-curve. We reformulate this conjecture by explicitly listing those systems which have unexpected dimension. Then we use a degeneration technique developed in a previous article ("Degenerations of Planar Linear Systems", alg-geom/9702015) to show that the conjecture holds for all m \leq 12.
