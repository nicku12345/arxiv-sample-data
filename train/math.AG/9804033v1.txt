We study the vector bundles without intermediate cohomology on Fano threefolds of index two, degree d=3,4,5 and Betti number one. We obtain a complete characterization in the case of rank-two vector bundles. For arbitrary rank, we give all possible Chern classes of such vector bundles, under some general condition.
