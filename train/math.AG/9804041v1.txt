In this paper a formula is proved for the general degeneracy locus associated to an oriented quiver of type A_n. Given a finite sequence of vector bundles with maps between them, these loci are described by putting rank conditions on arbitrary composites of the maps. Our answer is a polynomial in Chern classes of the bundles involved, depending on the given rank conditions. It can be expressed as a linear combination of products of Schur polynomials in the differences of the bundles. The coefficients are interesting generalizations of Littlewood-Richardson numbers. These polynomials specialize to give new formulas for Schubert polynomials.
