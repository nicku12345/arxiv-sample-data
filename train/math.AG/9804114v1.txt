Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is an important invariant of projective algebraic varieties. A well known conjecture due to Eisenbud and Goto gives a bound for regularity in terms of the codimension and degree,i.e., Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a given variety X is less than or equal to deg(X)-codimension(X)+1. Generic projection methods proved to be effective for the study of regularity of smooth projevtive varieties of dimension at most four(cf.[BM},[K2],[L],[Pi] and [R1]) because there are nice vanishing theorems for cohomology of vector bundles (e.g. the Kodaira-Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem) and detailed information about the fibers ofgeneric projections from X to a hypersurface of the same dimension. Here we show by using methods similar to those used in [K2] that \reg{X}\le(deg(X)-codimension(X)+1)+10 for any smooth fivefold and \reg{X}\le(deg(X)-codimension(X)+1)+20 for any smooth sixfold.   Furthermore, using similar methods we give a bound for the regularity of an arbitrary (not necessarily locally Cohen-Macaulay) projective surface X in P^N. To wit, we show that \reg{X}\le(d-e+1)d-(2e+1), where d=deg(X) and e=codimension(X). This is the first bound for surfaces which does not depend on smoothness.
