Let f: X \to S be flat morphism over an algebraically closed field k with a relative normal crossings divisor Y\subset X, (E, \nabla) be a bundle with a connection with log poles along Y and curvature with values in f^*\Omega^2_{k(S)}. Then the Gau\ss-Manin sheaf R^if_*(\Omega^*_{X/S}({\rm log} Y)\otimes E) carries a Gau\ss-Manin connection GM^i(\nabla). We establish a Riemann-Roch formula relating the algebraic Chern-Simons invariants of \nabla, GM^i(\nabla) and the top Chern class of \Omega^1_{X/S}({\rm log}Y).
