In 1988 S. Mori, D. Morrison, and I. Morrison gave a computer-based conjectural classification of four-dimensional cyclic quotient singularities of prime index. It was partially proven in 1990 by G. Sankaran. In 1991 Jim Lawrence basically proved this and much more, been unaware of algebro-geometric meaning of what he did. In this short note I just bring this all together to prove that all n-dimensional toric singularities with log-discrepancy greater than (or equal to) \epsilon form finitely many "series".
