We complete the proof of the fact that the moduli space of rank two bundles with trivial determinant embeds into the linear system of divisors on Pic^{g-1}C which are linearly equivalent to 2\Theta. The embedded tangent space at a semi-stable non-stable bundle \xi\oplus\xi^{-1}, where \xi is a degree zero line bundle, is shown to consist of those divisors in |2\Theta| which contain Sing(\Theta_{\xi}) where \Theta_{\xi} is the translate of \Theta by \xi. We also obtain geometrical results on the structure of this tangent space.
