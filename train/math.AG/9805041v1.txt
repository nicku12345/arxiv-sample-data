Let X be a projective complex 3-fold, quasihomogeneous with respect to an action of a linear algebraic group. We show that X is a compactification of SL_2/G, G a discrete subgroup, or that X can be equivariantly transformed into the 3-dim. projective space, the quadric Q_3, or into certain quasihomogeneous bundles with very simple structure.
