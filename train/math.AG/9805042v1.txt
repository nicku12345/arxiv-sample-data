In the present work we classify the relatively minimal 3-dimensional quasihomogeneous complex projective varieties under the assumption that the automorphism group is not solvable. By relatively minimal we understand varieties X having at most Q-factorial terminal singularities and allowing an extremal contraction X to Y, where dim Y <3.
