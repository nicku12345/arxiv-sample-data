This is the first part of two papers. In this part, we prove the blowup formulae for virtual Hodge polynomials of Gieseker moduli spaces of rank-2 stable sheaves and Uhlenbeck compactification spaces over algebraic surfaces. In particular, we verify the blowup formulae for the S-duality conjecture of Vafa-Witten, i.e. the blowup formulae for the Euler numbers of instanton moduli spaces over algebraic surfaces.
