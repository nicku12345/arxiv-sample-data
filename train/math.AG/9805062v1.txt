This is a report on some recent work by Gaffney, Massey, and the author, characterizing the conditions A_f and W_f for a family of ICIS germs equipped with a function. First we introduce the work informally. Then we review the formal definitions of A_f and W_f, and state the theorems that characterize them by the constancy of Milnor numbers. Next we review the definition of the Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity, and reformulate the theorems by the constancy of certain Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicities. Finally, we review the theory of integral dependence of elements on submodules of free modules, and apply it to prove the reformulated theorems.
