We consider an equisingularity problem for polynomial families of affine hypersurfaces X_\tau \subset \mathbb C^n with (at worst) isolated singularities. We show that the constancy of the global polar invariants \gamma^* (X_\tau) is equivalent to the t-equisingularity at infinity, an asymptotic-type equisingularity that we introduce. We prove that \gamma^*-constancy implies C^\infty-triviality in the neighbourhood of infinity. We show how the invariants \gamma^* enter in the description of a CW-complex model of a hypersurface X_\tau and therefore provide in particular new invariants at infinity for polynomial functions f: \mathbb C^n \to \mathbb C.
