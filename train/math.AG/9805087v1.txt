We show that, given a projective regular function f on a smooth quasi-projective variety over C, the corresponding cohomology groups of the algebraic de Rham complex with twisted differential d-df and of the complex of algebraic forms with differential df have the same dimension (a result announced by Barannikov and Kontsevitch). We generalize the result to de Rham complexes with coefficients in a mixed Hodge Module.
