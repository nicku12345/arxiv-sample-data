Let f_i be polynomials in n variables without a common zero. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that there are polynomials g_i such that \sum g_if_i=1. The effective versions of this result bound the degrees of the g_i in terms of the degrees of the f_j. The aim of this paper is to generalize this to the case when the f_i are replaced by arbitrary ideals. Applications to the B\'ezout theorem, to \L ojasiewicz--type inequialities and to deformation theory are also discussed.
