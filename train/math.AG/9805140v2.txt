In this paper we give for all n \geq 2, d>0, g \geq 0 necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a pair (X,C), where X is a K3 surface of degree 2n in \matbf{P}^{n+1} and C is a smooth (reduced and irreducible) curve of degree d and genus g on X. The surfaces constructed have Picard group of minimal rank possible (being either 1 or 2), and in each case we specify a set of generators. For n \geq 4 we also determine when X can be chosen to be an intersection of quadrics (in all other cases X has to be an intersection of both quadrics and cubics). Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for \O_C (k) to be non-special, for any integer k \geq 1.
