We introduce the operation of forming the tensor product in the theory of analytic Frobenius manifolds. Building on the results for formal Frobenius manifolds which we extend to the additional structures of Euler fields and flat identities, we prove that the tensor product of pointed germs of Frobenius manifolds exists. Furthermore, we define the notion of a tensor product diagram of Frobenius manifolds with factorizable flat identity and prove the existence such a diagram and hence a tensor product Frobenius manifold. These diagrams and manifolds are unique up to equivalence. Finally, we derive the special initial conditions for a tensor product of semi--simple Frobenius manifolds in terms of the special initial conditions of the factors.
