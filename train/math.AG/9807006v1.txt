We classify completely the surfaces of general type whose canonical map is 3-to-1 onto a surface of minimal degree in projective space. These surfaces fall into 5 distinct classes and we give explicit examples belonging to each of these classes. As far as we know, one of the examples thus constructed was unknown and it is a surface whose canonical system has two infinitely near base points.
