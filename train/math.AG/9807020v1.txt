On a real regular elliptic surface without multiple fiber, the Betti number h_1 and the Hodge number h^{1,1} are related by h_1\leq h^{1,1}. We prove that it's always possible to deform such algebraic surface to obtain h_1=h^{1,1}. Furthermore, we can impose that each homology class can be represented by a real algebraic curve. We use a real version of the modular construction of elliptic surfaces.
