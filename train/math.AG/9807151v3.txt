In this paper we construct arithmetic analogs of the Riemann-Roch theorem and Serre's duality for line bundles. This improves on the works of Tate and van der Geer - Schoof. We define H^0(L) and H^1(L) as some convolution of measures structures. The H^1 is defined by a procedure very similar to the usual Cech cohomology. We get Serre's duality as Pontryagin duality of convolution structures. We get separately Riemann-Roch formula and Serre's duality. Instead of using the Poisson summation formula, we basically reprove it. The whole theory is pretty much parallel to the geometric case.
