We classify, up to isomorphism, maximal curves covered by the Hermitian curve \mathcal H by a prime degree Galois covering. We also compute the genus of maximal curves obtained by the quotient of \mathcal H by several automorphisms groups. Finally we discuss the value for the third largest genus that a maximal curve can have.
