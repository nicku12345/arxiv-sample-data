Let X=\C^n. In this paper we present an algorithm that computes the de Rham cohomology groups H^i_{dR}(U,\C) where U is the complement of an arbitrary Zariski-closed set Y in X. Our algorithm is a merger of the algorithm given by T.~Oaku and N.~Takayama (\cite{O-T2}), who considered the case where Y is a hypersurface, and our methods from \cite{W-1} for the computation of local cohomology. We further extend the algorithm to compute de Rham cohomology groups with support H^i_{dR,Z}(U,\C) where again U is an arbitrary Zariski-open subset of X and Z is an arbitrary Zariski-closed subset of U. Our main tool is the generalization of the restriction process from \cite{O-T1} to complexes of modules over the Weyl algebra. All presented algorithms are based on Gr\"obner basis computations in the Weyl algebra.
