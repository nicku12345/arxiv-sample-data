Let (S,H) be a rational algebraic surface with an ample divisor. We compute generating functions for the Hodge numbers of the moduli spaces of H-stable rank 2 sheaves on S in terms of certain theta functions for indefinite lattices that were introduced in the paper alg-geom/9612020 written jointly with Don Zagier. If H lies in the closure of the ample cone and has self-intersection 0, it follows that the generating functions are Jacobi forms. In particular the generating functions for the Euler numbers have a similar transformation behaviour under SL(2,Z) as that predicted in Vafa and Witten: A strong coupling test of S-duality. In addition we get that also the generating functions for the signatures can be expressed in terms of modular forms. Finally it turns out that the generating function for the signatures is also (with respect to another developping parameter) the generating function for the Donaldson invariants of S evaluated on all powers of the point class. The paper is related to the recent papers math.AG/9805003 by Yoshioka, math.AG/9805054 and math.AG/9805055 by Qin and Li and hep-th/9802168 by Minahan, Nemeschansky, Vafa and Warner.
