Let X be a smooth complex projective curve of genus g bigger or equal to 1. If g is bigger than 1 assume further that X is either bielliptic or with general moduli. Under a natural condition on slopes, we prove that there exists a short exact sequence of semistable vector bundles with given ranks and degrees. The importance of the paper consists of the new method adopted for the proves.
