In this paper we study the \'etale cohomology groups associated to abelian varieties. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for an abelian variety to have semistable reduction (or purely additive reduction which becomes semistable over a quadratic extension) in terms of the action of the absolute inertia group on the \'etale cohomology groups with finite coefficients.
