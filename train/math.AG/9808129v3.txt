This is the abstruct of the revised paper. We study the equivariant analytic torsion for K3 surfaces with an anti-symplectic involution with the invariant lattice M (such a surface is called a 2-elementary K3 surface of type M in this paper), and show that it (together with the analytic torsion of the fixed curves) can be identified with the automorphic form on the moduli space characterizing the discriminant locus. Three lattices A_1, II_{1,1}(2), II_{1,9}(2) are of particular interest, because they consist of the building blocks of 2-elementary lattices. An explicit formula is given for them. In particular, if M is twice the Enriques lattice, the automorphic form coincides with Borcherds's Phi-function which confirms an observation by Jorgenson-Todorov and Harvey-Moore. Some other examples are shown to be related to Borcherds's product and generalized Kac-Moody algebras.
