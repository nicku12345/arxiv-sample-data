Using toric geometry, lattice theory, and elliptic surface techniques, we compute the Picard Lattice of certain K3 surfaces. In particular, we examine the generic member of each of M. Reid's list of 95 families of Gorenstein K3 surfaces which occur as hypersurfaces in weighted projective 3-spaces. The results appear in a multipage table near the end of the paper. As an application, we are able to determine whether the mirror family (in the sense of mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces) for each one is also on Reid's list.
