We characterize the subscheme of the moduli space of torsion-free sheaves on an elliptic surface which are stable of relative degree zeero (with respect to a polarization of type aH+bf, H being the section and f the elliptic fibre) which is isomorphic, via the relative Fourier-Mukai transform, with the relative compactified Simpson Jacobian of the family of those curves D in the surface which are flat over the base of the elliptic fibration. This generalizes and completes earlier constructions due to Friedman, Morgan and Witten. We also study the relative moduli scheme of sheaves whose restriction to each fibre is torsion-free and semistable of rank n and degree zero for higher dimensional elliptic fibrations. The relative Fourier-Mukai transform induces an isomorphic between this relative moduli space and the relative n-th symmetric product of the fibration.
