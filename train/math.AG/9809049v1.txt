In this paper, we contribute toward a classification of two-variable polynomials by classifying (up to an automorphism of C^2) polynomials whose Newton polygon is either a triangle or a line segment. Our classification has several applications to the study of embeddings of algebraic curves in the plane. In particular, we show that for any k \ge 2, there is an irreducible curve with one place at infinity, which has at least k inequivalent embeddings in C^2. Also, upon combining our method with a well-known theorem of Zaidenberg and Lin, we show that one can decide "almost" just by inspection whether or not a polynomial fiber is an irreducible simply connected curve.
