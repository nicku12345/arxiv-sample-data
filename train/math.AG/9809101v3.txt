Nagata has conjectured that the following statement (N_r) holds for all r\geq 10: (N_r) if P_1,...P_r \in {\mathbb P}^2 are generic points then any plane curve C satisfies \sum_1^r mult_{P_i}(C)\leq \sqrt{r} deg(C). Nagata proved (N_r) whenever r is a perfect square. Here we prove (N_r) provided r=k^2+\alpha,1\leq\alpha\leq2k,k\geq 3 and either (i) \alpha is odd and \alpha\geq \sqrt{2k} or (ii) \alpha is even and at lest 6, and the fractional part of \sqrt{r} is at most 2(\sqrt{2}-1).
