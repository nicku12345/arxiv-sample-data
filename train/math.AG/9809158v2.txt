For a double solid V\to P_3(C) branched over a surface B\subset P_3(C) with only ordinary nodes as singularities, we give a set of generators of the divisor class group Pic(\tilde{V}}) in terms of contact surfaces of B with only superisolated singularities in the nodes of B. As an application we give a condition when the integral cohomology of \tilde{V} has no 2-torsion. All possible cases are listed if B is a quartic surface. Furthermore we give a new lower bound for the dimension of the code of B.
