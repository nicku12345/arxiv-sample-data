This paper gives a canonical construction, in terms of additive cohomological functors, of the universal formal deformation of a compact complex manifold without vector fields (more generally of a faithful g-module, where g is a sheaf of Lie algebras without sections). The construction is based on a certain (multivariate) Jacobi complex J(g) associatd to g: indeed {\mathbb C}\oplus {\mathbb H}^0(J(g))^* is precisely the base ring of the universal deformation.
