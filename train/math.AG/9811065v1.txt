Let X be a smooth compact projective variety over \mathbb C.   Let H^2(\pi_1(X),\mathbb R)^{1,1} be the intersection of H^{1,1}(X,{\mathbb R}) with the image of the map H^2(\pi_1(X),{\mathbb R})\to H^2(X) induced by the classifying map X\to B\pi_1(X). Let NS(X) be the N\'eron-Severi group of X.   Let [\omega]\in H^2(\pi_1(X),\mathbb R)^{1,1}+ NS(X)\otimes {\mathbb R}. In this note, we prove that [\omega] is the cohomology class of a K\"ahler metric if and only if for every d-dimensional reduced closed algebraic subvariety Z\subset X, [\omega]^d.Z>0.
