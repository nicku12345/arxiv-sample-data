We give a criterion for a continuous family of curves on a nodal K-trivial threefold X_0 to contribute geometrically rigid curves to a general smoothing of X_0. As an application, we prove the existence of geometrically rigid curves of arbitrary degree and explicitly bounded genus on general complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds.
