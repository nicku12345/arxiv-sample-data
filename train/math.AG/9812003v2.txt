We work out the notion of mirror symmetry for abelian varieties and study its properties. Our construction are based on the correspondence between two Q--algebraic groups. One is the Hodge (or special Mumford--Tate) group. The second group \bar{Spin(A)} is defined as follows: the group of autoequivalences of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves acts on the total cohomology H(A,Q) of an abelian variety A via algebraic correspondences. The group \bar{Spin(A)} is now the Zariski closure of its image in GL(H(A,Q)). Our constructions are compatible with the picture of mirror symmetry sketched by Kontsevich, Morrison, and others.
