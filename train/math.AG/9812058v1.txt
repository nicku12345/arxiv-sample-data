Given a smooth projective variety X over a field k of characteristic zero, we consider the composition of the de Rham cohomology cycle class map over k from the Chow group CH^q(X\times_kK), where K is the field of fractions of henselization A^h of the local ring of a smooth closed point of a variety over the field k with an appropriate projection: CH^q(X\times_kK)\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{p=1}^qgr_F^{q-p}N^{q-p} H^{2q-p}_{dR/k}(X)\otimes_k\Omega^p_{A^h/k,{\rm closed}}, where F^{\bullet} and N^{\bullet} are the Hodge and the coniveau filtrations on the de Rham cohomology, respectively. The classical Abel--Jacobi map corresponds to the composition of this homomorphism with the projection to the summand p=1.   This homomorphism is not injective, however, its composition with the embedding into the space \bigoplus_{p=1}^qgr_F^{q-p}N^{q-p}H^{2q-p}_{dR/k}(X)\otimes_k \lim_{\longleftarrow_M}d(\Omega^{p-1}_{A_M/k}), where A_M=A^h/{\frak m}^M and {\frak m} is the maximal ideal, is dominant for any q for which the inverse Lefschetz operator H^{2\dim X-q}(X)(\dim X)\stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow}H^q(X)(q) is induced by a correspondence.
