We study the geometry and cohomology of semiample hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Such hypersurfaces generalize the MPCP-desingularizations of Calabi-Yau ample hypersurfaces in the Batyrev mirror construction. We study the topological cup product on the middle cohomology of semiample hypersurfaces. In particular, we obtain a complete algebraic description of the middle cohomology of regular semiample hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional simplicial toric varieties what would be interesting for physics.
