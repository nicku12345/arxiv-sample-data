We consider K_X-negative extremal contractions f\colon X\to (Z,o), where X is an algebraic threefold with only \epsilon-log terminal Q-factorial singularities and (Z,o) is a two (resp., one)-dimensional germ. The main result is that K_X is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6-complementary or we have, so called, exceptional case and then the singularity (Z\in o) is bounded (resp., the multiplicity of the central fiber f^{-1}(o) is bounded).
