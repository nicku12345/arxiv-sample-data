We construct a version of Fourier transform for a class of non-commutative algebras over abelian varieties which include algebras of twisted differential operators generalizing the previous construction of Laumon (alg-geom/9603004) and of the second author (alg-geom/9602023). We also construct the microlocal version of this transform and its etale localization in the framework of Kapranov's theory of NC-schemes (see math.AG/9802041).
