We construct an A_{\infty}-structure on the Ext-groups of hermitian holomorphic vector bundles on a compact complex manifold. We propose a generalization of the homological mirror conjecture due to Kontsevich. Namely, we conjecture that for mirror dual Calabi-Yau manifolds M and X there exists an A_{\infty}-functor from Fukaya's symplectic A_{\infty}-category of M to the A_{\infty}-derived category of X which is a homotopy equivalence on morphisms. We verify the part of this conjecture concering triple products for elliptic curves.
