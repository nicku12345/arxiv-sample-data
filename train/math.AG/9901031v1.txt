This paper proves that the 5-canonical map of a smooth minimal 3-fold is birational when the geometric genus is bigger than 2. A combination of the results in this paper and that of Ein-Lazarsfeld-Lee, the possible exceptional cases are very limited. Unfortunately, no counter examples have been found up to now.
