In this paper, we will list up all the cases for the ray contractions of divisorial and fiber types for smooth projective varieties of dimension five. These are obtained as a corollary from the lists of n-dimensional k-th adjoint contractions f: X -> Y of the same types for k=1,2,3 and 4 (n> or =5). The lists for k=1,2 and 3 have previously been obtained in [Na], Proposition 1.2 and Theorem 1.3. The main task will be to have such a list for k=4, where one case in the list fails to show that a positive-dimensional general fiber F of f is irreducible when n>5. This assertion will, however, be proven when n=5 with an essential aid of 3-dimensional Minimal Model Program in [Mo2]. (We do not show the existence of cases.)
