Using the data schemes developed by Arrondo-Sols-Speiser, we give a rigorous definition of algebraic differential equations on the complex projective space P^n. For an algebraic subvariety S \subseteq P^n, we present an explicit formula for the degree of the divisor of solutions of a differential equation on S and give some examples of applications. We extend the technique and result to the real case.
