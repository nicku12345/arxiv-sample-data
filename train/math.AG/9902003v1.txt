Given a compact Riemann surface \bar{X} of genus g and a point q on \bar{X}, we consider X:=\bar{X}\setminus\{q\} with a basepoint p\in X. The extension of mixed Hodge structures, given by the weights -1 and -2, of the mixed Hodge structure on the fundamental group (in the sense of Hain) is studied. We show that it naturally corresponds on the one hand to the element (2g q-2 p-K) in \Pic^0(\bar{X}), where K represents the canonical divisor, and on the other hand to the respective extension of \bar{X}. Finally, we prove a pointed Torelli theorem for punctured Riemann surfaces.
