On a space of stable maps, the psi classes are modified by subtracting certain boundary divisors. The top products of modified psi classes, usual psi classes, and classes pulled back along the evaluation maps are called twisted descendants; it is shown that in genus 0, they admit a complete recursion and are determined by the Gromov-Witten invariants. One motivation for this construction is that all characteristic numbers (of rational curves) can be interpreted as twisted descendants; this is explained in the second part, using pointed tangency classes. As an example, some of Schubert's numbers of twisted cubics are verified.
