Compactifications of moduli spaces of (1,p)-polarized abelian surfaces with level structures of canonical type have been described in great detail by Hulek, Kahn and Weintraub. The aim of this paper is to determine some invariants of smooth models of these moduli spaces. In particular, a geometric description of their canonical divisors is given and their Chern numbers are computed.
