Equivariant compactifications of reductive groups can be described by combinatorial data. On the other hand, equivariant compactifications of the additive group G^n_a are more complicated in at least two respects. First, they often admit moduli. Second, even simple varieties (like projective spaces) admit many different structures as equivariant compactifications of the additive group. We give a dictionary relating Artinian local rings, certain systems of partial differential equations, and equivariant compactifications of G^n_a. As an application, we classify the structures on varieties like projective spaces, ruled surfaces, and certain threefolds. We consider these results as a first step in a systematic study of G^n_a-equivariant birational geometry.
