In this paper we construct 206 examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds with different Euler numbers. All constructed examples are smooth models of double coverings of P^3 branched along an octic surface. We allow 11 types of (not necessary isolated) singularities in the branch locus. Thus we broaden the class of examples studied in math.AG/9902057. For every considered example we compute the Euler number and give a precise description of a resolution of singularities.
