Let \cMx be the moduli space of stable vector bundles of rank n\geq 3 and determinant \xi over a connected Riemann surface X, with n and d(\xi) coprime. Let D be a Calabi-Yau hypersurface of \cMx. Denote by U_D the restriction of the universal bundle to X\times D. It is shown that the restriction (U_D)_x to x\times D is stable, for any x\in X. Furthermore, for a general curve the connected component of the moduli space of semistable sheaves over D, containing (U_D)_x, is isomorphic to X. It is also shown that U_D is stable for any polarisation, and the connected component of the moduli space of semistable sheaves over X\times D, containing U_D, is isomorphic to the Jacobian. Moreover, this is an isomorphism of polarised varieties, and hence such a moduli spaces determine the Reimann surface.
