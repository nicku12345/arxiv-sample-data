Seshadri constants are local invariants, introduced by Demailly, which measure the local positivity of ample line bundles. Recent interest in Seshadri constants stems on the one hand from the fact that bounds on Seshadri constants yield, via vanishing theorems, bounds on the number of points and jets that adjoint linear series separate. On the other hand it has become increasingly clear by now that Seshadri constants are highly interesting invariants quite in their own right. Except in the simplest cases, however, they are already in the case of surfaces very hard to control or to compute explicitly---hardly any explicit values of Seshadri constants are known so far. The purpose of the present paper is to study these invariants on algebraic surfaces. On the one hand, we prove a number of explicit bounds for Seshadri constants and Seshadri submaximal curves, and on the other hand, we give complete results for abelian surfaces of Picard number one. A nice feature of this result is that it allows to explicitly compute the Seshadri constants---as well as the unique irreducible curve that accounts for it---for a whole class of surfaces. It also shows that Seshadri constants have an intriguing number-theoretic flavor in this case.
