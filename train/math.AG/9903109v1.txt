An effective divisor D on a smooth (compact complex) surface X is called even, if its class [D] \in H^2(X,\Z) is divisible by 2. D may be assumed reduced w.l.o.g. Then D being even is equivalent to the existence of a double cover Y \to X branched exactly over D.   The aim of this note is to study arrangements of n \leq 10 distinct lines on a smooth quartic surface X \subset \P_3, which form an even divisor in this sense. The result is that for n \leq 8 there are no unexpected ones (one type of six lines, four types of eight lines). And for n=10 a partial classification is given in the following sense: Each even set of ten lines on a smooth quartic surface is of one of eleven different types. At the moment I do not know which of these types do actually occur. The proof for these facts is messy, essentially checking cases.
