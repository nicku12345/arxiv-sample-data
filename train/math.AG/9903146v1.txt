This paper gives an introduction to Kuga-Satake varieties and discusses some aspects of the Hodge conjecture related to them. Kuga-Satake varieties are abelian varieties associated to certain weight two Hodge structures, for example the second cohomology group of a K3 surface. We give a detailed account of the construction of Kuga-Satake varieties and of their decomposition in simple subvarieties. We recall the Hodge conjecture and we point out a connection between the Hodge conjecture for abelian fourfolds and Kuga-Satake varieties. We discuss the implications of the Hodge conjecture on the geometry of surfaces whose second cohomology group has a Kuga-Satake variety. We conclude with some recent results on Kuga-Satake varieties of Hodge structures on which an imaginary quadratic field acts.
