Let V be a complex vector space on which a finite group G acts by linear transformations. Let W = V \oplus V^* be the sum of V with its dual V^*. We prove that if the quotient W/G admits a smooth crepant resolution, then the subgroup G \subset Aut V is generated by complex reflections. We also obtain some results on the structure of smooth crepant resolutions of the quotients W/G, where W is a symplectic vector space, and G \subset Aut W is a finite group of symplectic linear transformations of the vector space W.
