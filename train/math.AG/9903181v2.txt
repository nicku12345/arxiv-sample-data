We give an example of geometric construction (via Hecke correspondences) of certain representations of the affine Lie algebra \hat{gl}_n. The construction is similar to the one of [FK] for the Lie algebra sl_n. Given a surface with a smooth embedded curve C we consider the moduli spaces K_\alpha of rank n parabolic sheaves satisfying certain conditions. The top dimensional irreducible components of K_\alpha are numbered by the isomorphism classes of \alpha-dimensional nilpotent representations of the cyclic quiver \tilde{A}_{n-1}. Summing up over all \alpha\in{\Bbb N}[{\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z}] we obtain a vector space M with a basis of fundamental classes of top dimensional components of K_\alpha. The natural correspondences give rise to the action of Chevalley generators e_i,f_i\in\hat{sl}_n on M. We compute explicitly the matrix coefficients of e_i,f_i in the above basis. The central charge of M depends on the genus of the curve C and the degree of its normal bundle.
