We study the higher Abel-Jacobi invariant defined recently by M. Green. We first construct a counterexample to the injectivity of Green's higher Abel-Jacobi map.   On the other hand, we prove that the higher Abel-Jacobi map governs Mumford's pull-back of holomorphic forms. We deduce from this that if a surface has holomorphic 2-forms, the image of the higher Abel-Jacobi map, defined on its group of zero-cycles Albanese equivalent to 0, has infinite dimensional image.
