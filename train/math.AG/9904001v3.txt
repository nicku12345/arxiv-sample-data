Let P \cup P' be the two component Prym variety associated to an \'etale double cover \tilde{C} \to C of a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus g \geq 6 and let |2\Xi_0| and |2\Xi_0'| be the linear systems of second order theta divisors on P and P' respectively. The component P' contains canonically the Prym curve \tilde{C}. We show that the base locus of the subseries of divisors containing \tilde{C} \subset P' is scheme-theoretically the curve \tilde{C}. We also prove canonical isomorphisms between some subseries of |2\Xi_0| and |2\Xi_0'| and some subseries of second order theta divisors on the Jacobian of C.
