We compute the cohomology spaces for the tautological bundle tensor the determinant bundle on the punctual Hilbert scheme H of subschemes of length n of a smooth projective surface X. We show that for L and A invertible vector bundles on X, and w the canonical bundle of X, if w^{-1}\otimes L, w^{-1}\otimes A and A are ample vector bundles, then the higher cohomology spaces on H of the tautological bundle associated to L tensor the determinant bundle associated to A vanish, and the space of global sections is computed in terms of H^0(A) and H^0(L\otimes A). This result is motivated by the computation of the space of global sections of the determinant bundle on the moduli space of rank 2 semi-stable sheaves on the projective plane, supporting Le Potier's Strange duality conjecture on the projective plane.
