Let X be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus g, with g\geq 2, and {\cal M}_{\xi} a smooth moduli space of fixed determinant semistable vector bundles of rank n, with n\geq 2, over X. Take a smooth anticanonical divisor D on {\cal M}_{\xi}. So D is a Calabi-Yau variety. We compute the number of moduli of D, namely \dim H^1(D, T_D), to be 3g-4 + \dim H^0({\cal M}_{\xi}, K^{-1}_{{\cal M}_{\xi}}). Denote by \cal N the moduli space of all such pairs (X',D'), namely D' is a smooth anticanonical divisor on a smooth moduli space of semistable vector bundles over the Riemann surface X'. It turns out that the Kodaira-Spencer map from the tangent space to \cal N, at the point represented by the pair (X,D), to H^1(D, T_D) is an isomorphism. This is proved under the assumption that if g =2, then n\neq 2,3, and if g=3, then n\neq 2.
