We define a new class of holomorphic (n-1)-bundles on the n-dimensional complex projective space, that contains the Tango bundles and their stable Horrock's pull-backs; we show that these bundles are invariant under small deformations and that their isomorphism classes correspond to smooth points of moduli spaces.
