Let S be a smooth projective surfaces and S^[n] the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional subschemes of S of length n. We proof that the class of S^[n] in the complex cobordism ring depends only on the class of the surface itself. Moreover, we compute the cohomology and holomorphic Euler characterisitcs of certain tautological sheaves on S^[n] and prove results on the general structure of certain integrals over polynomials in Chern classes of tautological sheaves.
