Let d,m_1,...,m_r be (r+1) positive integers, and P_1,...,P_r be r general points in the projective plane ; let m be a positive integer. We prove that there exists a bound d_0(m) such that :   If m_i < m (0<i<r+1), and d > d_0(m) then the linear system L of plane curves of degree d having a multiplicity at least m_i at each point P_i has the expected dimension ; moreover, if L is not empty, there exists an irreducible plane curve of degree d, smooth away from the r points P_i, and having an ordinary singularity of the prescribed multiplicity m_i at each point P_i. This curve may be isolated in L.
