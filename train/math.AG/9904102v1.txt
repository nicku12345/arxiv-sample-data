Let X be a smooth variety defined over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic and \O_X(H) be a very ample line bundle on X. We show that for a semistable X-bundle E of rank two, there exists an integer m depending only on \Delta(E).H^{\dim(X)-2} and H^{\dim(X)} such that the restriction of E to a general divisor in |mH| is again semistable. As corollaries we obtain boundedness results, and weak versions of Bogomolov's theorem and Kodaira's vanishing theorem for surfaces in arbitrary characteristic.
