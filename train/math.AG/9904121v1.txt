We deduce the Riemann-Roch type formula expressing the microlocal Euler class of a perfect complex of D-modules in terms of the Chern character of the associated symbol complex and the Todd class of the manifold from the Riemann-Roch type theorem for periodic cyclic cocycles of a symplectic deformation quantization. The proof of the latter is contained in the sequel to this paper.
