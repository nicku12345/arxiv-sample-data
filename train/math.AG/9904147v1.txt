Let X be a non-singular algebraic curve of genus g. We prove that the Brill-Noether locus \bns  is non-empty if d= nd' +d''  with 0< d'' <2n, 1\le s\le g, d'\geq (s-1)(s+g)/s , n\leq d''+(n-k)g, (d'',k)\ne(n,n). These results hold for an arbitrary curve of genus \ge 2, and allow us to construct a region in the associated ``Brill-Noether \pa-map'' of points for which the Brill-Noether loci are non-empty. Even for the generic case, the region so constructed extends beyond that defined by the so-called ``Teixidor parallelograms.'' For hyperelliptic curves, the same methods give more extensive and precise results.
