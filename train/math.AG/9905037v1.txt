An approach for the computation of upper bounds on the size of large complete arcs is presented. We obtain in particular geometrical properties of irreducible envelopes associated to a second largest complete arc provided that the order of the underlying field is large enough. We use Stoehr-Voloch's approach to the Hasse-Weil bound for rational points of curves defined over finite fields
