I prove the existence, and describe the structure, of moduli space of pairs (p,\Theta) consisting of a projective variety P with semiabelian group action and an ample Cartier divisor on it satisfying a few simple conditions. Every connected component of this moduli space is proper. A component containing a projective toric variety is described by a configuration of several polytopes, the main one of which is the secondary polytope. On the other hand, the component containing a principally polarized abelian variety provides a moduli compactification of A_g. The main irreducible component of this compactification is described by an "infinite periodic" analog of the secondary polytope and coincides with the toroidal compactification of A_g for the second Voronoi decomposition.
