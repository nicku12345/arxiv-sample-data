In a previous paper the authors elaborated notions and technique which could be applied to compute such invariants of polynomials as Euler characteristics of fibres and zeta-functions of monodromy transformations associated with a polynomial. Some crucial basic properties of the notions related to the topology of meromorphic germs were not discussed there. This has produced some lack of understanding of the general constructions. The aim of this note is to partially fill in this gap. At the same time we describe connections with some previous results and generalizations of them.
