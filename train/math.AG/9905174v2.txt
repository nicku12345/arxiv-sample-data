Realizing a part of the Derived Deformation Theory program, we construct a "derived" analog of the Grothendieck's Quot scheme parametrizing subsheaves in a given coherent sheaf F on a smooth projective variety X. This analog is a differential graded manifold RQuot_h(F) (so it is always smooth in an appropriate sense) whose tangent space at a point represented by a subsheaf K in F, is a cochain complex quasiisomorphic to RHom(K, F/K).
