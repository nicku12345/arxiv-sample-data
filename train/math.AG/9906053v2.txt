Interpreting the number of ramified covering of a Riemann surface by Riemann surfaces as the relative Gromov-Witten invariants and applying a gluing formula, we derive a recursive formula for the number of ramified covering of a Riemann surface by Riemann surface with elementary branch points and prescribed ramification type over a special point.
