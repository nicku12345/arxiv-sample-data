In this note we compute the cohomological obstruction to the existence of certain sheaves of vertex algebras on smooth varieties. These sheaves have been introduced and studied in the previous work by A.Vaintrob and two of the authors. Hopefully our result clarifies to some extent the constructions of the above work.
