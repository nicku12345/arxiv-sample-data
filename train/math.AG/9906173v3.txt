In this paper we consider the analogue of the Sato's functional equation for the prehomogeneous vector spaces over finite fields. The corresponding character sums depend on a relative invariant on such a space and an irreducible representation of the group of components of the stabilizer of a generic point. The proof is based on the Picard-Lefschetz formula in l-adique cohomology.
