We suggest an effective procedure to calculate numerical invariants for rank two bundles over blown-up surfaces. We study the moduli spaces M_j of bundles on the blown-up plane splitting over the exceptional divisor as O(j)+O(-j). We use the numerical invariants to give a topological decomposition of M_j.
