This is an announcement of a long paper in progress. On a locally compact space, we introduce the stack of ind-sheaves (ind-objects of the category of sheaves with compact support) and construct the analogous of the usual six operations on sheaves. As an application, we treat, in the formalism of ind-sheaves, functions with growth conditions such as the ``tempered holomorphic functions'' on a complex manifold. We also construct a microlocalization functor from the category of sheaves on a manifold to that of ind-sheaves on the cotangent bundle.
