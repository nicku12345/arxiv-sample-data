This is a comment on the Kuranishi method of constructing analytic deformation spaces. It is based on a simple observation that the Kuranishi map can always be inverted in the category of L_{\infty}-algebras. The L_{\infty}-structure obtained by this inversion is used to define an ''unobstructed'' deformation functor which is always representable by a smooth pointed moduli space.   The singular nature of the original Kuranishi deformation space emerges in this setting merely as a result of the truncation of this ``naive'' L_{\infty}-algebra controlling the deformations to a usual differential Lie algebra.
