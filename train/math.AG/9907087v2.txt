We consider the quotients X = V/G of a symplectic complex vector space V by a finite subgroup G \subset Sp(V) which admit a smooth crepant resolution Y \to X. For such quotients, we prove the homological McKay correspondence conjectured by M. Reid. Namely, we construct a natural basis in the homology space H_\cdot(Y,\Q) whose elements are numbered by the conjugacy classes in the finite group G.
