We give a formalism of arithmetic mixed sheaves including the case of arithmetic mixed Hodge structures, and show the nonvanishing of certain higher extension groups, and also the nontriviality of the second Abel-Jacobi map for zero cycles on a smooth proper complex variety of any dimension under the existence of a nontrivial global two-form. For two codimensional cycles, the injectivity of the cycle map is reduced to that of the Abel-Jacobi map for smooth projective varieties over number fields. (This shows that Asakura's additional hypothesis is unnecessary). Here it is also possible to use the systems of realizations in the definition of the cycle map and the Abel-Jacobi map. Some arguments can be extended to higher Chow groups, and we get evidence for a conjecture of C. Voisin on the countability of indecomposable higher cycles.
