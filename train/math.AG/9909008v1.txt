Let Y be a normal crossing divisor in the smooth projective algebraic variety X (defined over {\mathbb C}) and let U be a tubular neighbourhood of Y in X. We construct homological cycles generating H_*(A,B), where (A,B) is one of the following pairs (Y,\emptyset), (X,Y), (X,X-Y), (X-Y,\emptyset) and (\partial U,\emptyset). The construction is compatible with the weights in H_*(A,B,{\mathbb Q}) of Deligne's mixed Hodge structure.
