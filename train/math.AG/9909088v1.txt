For an irreducible subvariety Z in an algebraic group G we define a nonnegative integer gdeg(Z) as the degree, in a certain sense, of the Gauss map of Z. It can be regarded as a substitution for the intersection index of the conormal bundle to Z with the zero section of T^*G, even though G may be non-compact. For G a semiabelian variety (in particular, an algebraic torus (C^*)^n) we prove a Riemann-Roch-type formula for constructible sheaves on G, which involves our substitutions for the intersection indices. As a corollary, we get that a perverse sheaf on such a G has nonnegative Euler characteristic, generalizing a theorem of Loeser-Sabbah.
