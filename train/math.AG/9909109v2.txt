This is an attempt towards the understanding of the (birational) Kaehler cone of a compact hyperkaehler manifold in terms of the Beauville-Bogomolov form on its second cohomology. We discuss birational correspondences between hyperkaehler manifolds and their effects on the cohomology. Many of the results are conjectural in as much as they depend on a projectivity criterion for compact hyperkaehler manifolds contained in this paper's predecessor, but in which a serious mistake has oocured. An erratum is given in Sect. 6 and a way to rescue the approach is proposed in Sect. 7.
