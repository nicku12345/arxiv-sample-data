We use stable maps, and their stable lifts to the Semple bundle variety of second-order curvilinear data, to calculate certain characteristic numbers for rational plane curves. These characteristic numbers involve first-order (tangency) and second-order (inflectional) conditions. Although they may be virtual, they may be used as inputs in an enumeratively significant formula for the number of rational curves having a triple contact with a specified plane curve and passing through 3d-3 general points.
