We explore the role played by the spectral curves associated with Higgs pairs in the context of the Nahm transform of doubly-periodic instantons defined in "Construction of doubly-periodic instantons" (math.DG/9909069) and "Nahm transform for doubly-periodic instantons" (math.DG/9910120). More precisely, we show how to construct a triple consisting of an algebraic curve plus a line bundle with connection over it from a doubly-periodic instanton, and that these coincide with the Hitchin's spectral data associated with the Nahm transformed Higgs bundle.
