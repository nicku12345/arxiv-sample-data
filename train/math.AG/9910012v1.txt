Let S be a minimal surface of general type with p_g(S)=0 and such that the bicanonical map \phi:S\to \pp^{K^2_S} is a morphism: then the degree of \phi is at most 4 and if it is equal to 4 then K^2_S\le 6. Here we prove that if K^2_S=6 and \deg \phi=4 then S is a so-called {\em Burniat surface}.   In addition we show that minimal surfaces with p_g=0, K^2=6 and bicanonical map of degree 4 form a 4-dimensional irreducible connected component of the moduli space of surfaces of general type.
