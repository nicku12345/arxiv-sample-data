For a compact Riemann surface X of genus g > 1, \Hom(\pi_1(X), U(p,1))/U(p,1) is the moduli space of flat \U(p,1)-connections on X. There is an integer invariant, \tau, the Toledo invariant associated with each element in \Hom(\pi_1(X), U(p,1))/U(p,1). If q = 1, then -2(g-1) \le \tau \le 2(g-1). This paper shows that \Hom(\pi_1(X), U(p,1))/U(p,1) has one connected component corresponding to each \tau \in 2Z with -2(g-1) \le \tau \le 2(g-1). Therefore the total number of connected components is 2(g-1) + 1.
