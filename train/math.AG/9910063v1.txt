A 10-dimensional symplectic moduli space of torsion sheaves on the cubic 4-fold is constructed. It parametrizes the stable rank 2 vector bundles on the hypeplane sections of the cubic 4-fold which are obtained by Serre's construction from normal elliptic quintics. The natural projection to the dual projective 5-space parametrizing the hyperplane sections is a Lagrangian fibration. The symplectic structure is closely related (and conjecturally, is equal) to the quasi-symplectic one, induced by the Yoneda pairing on the moduli space.
