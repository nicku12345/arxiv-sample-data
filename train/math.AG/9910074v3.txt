A minimal surface of general type with p_g(S)=0 satisfies 1\le K^2\le 9 and it is known that the image of the bicanonical map \fie is a surface for K_S^2\geq 2, whilst for K^2_S\geq 5, the bicanonical map is always a morphism. In this paper it is shown that \fie is birational if K_S^2=9 and that the degree of \fie is at most 2 if K_S^2=7 or K_S^2=8.   By presenting two examples of surfaces S with K_S^2=7 and 8 and bicanonical map of degree 2, it is also shown that this result is sharp. The example with K_S^2=8 is, to our knowledge, a new example of a surface of general type with p_g=0.
