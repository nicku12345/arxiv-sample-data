This paper studies hypersurface exceptional singularities in \mathbb C^n defined by non-degenerate function. For each canonical hypersurface singularity, there exists a weighted homogeneous singularity such that the former is exceptional if and only if the latter is exceptional. So we study the weighted homogeneous case and prove that the number of weights of weighted homogeneous exceptional singularities are finite. Then we determine all exceptional singularities of the Brieskorn type of dimension 3.
