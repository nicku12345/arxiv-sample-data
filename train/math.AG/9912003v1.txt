Let X be as smooth complex projective variety with Neron-Severi group isomorphic to Z, and D an irreducible divisor with normal crossing singularities. Assume r is equal to 2 or 3. We prove that if the fundamental group of X doesn't have irreducible PU(r) representations, then the fundamental group of X-D doesn't have irreducible U(r) representations. The proof uses the non-existence of certain stable parabolic bundles. We also obtain a similar result for GL(2) when D is smooth and X is a complex surface.
