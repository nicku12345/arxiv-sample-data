Let f: X \to S be a smooth morphism in characteristic 0, and let (E, \nabla_{X/S}) be a relative regular connection. We define a cohomology of relative differential characters on X which receives classes of (E, \nabla_{X/S}). It says in particular that the partial vanishing of the trace of the iterated Atiyah classs can be made canonical. While applied to a family of curves and c_2, the construction yields a connection of f_*c_2(E). This one has been constructed analytically by A. Beilinson. We also relate our construction to the trace complex of Beilinson of Schechtman.
