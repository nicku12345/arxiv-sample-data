Let \mathcal N be the moduli space of sextics with 3 (3,4)-cusps. The quotient moduli space {\mathcal N}/G is one-dimensional and consists of two components, {\mathcal N}_{torus}/G and {\mathcal N}_{gen}/G. By quadratic transformations, they are transformed into one-parameter families C_s and D_s of cubic curves respectively. We study the Mordell-Weil torsion groups of cubic curves C_s over \bfQ and D_s over \bfQ(\sqrt{-3}) respectively. We show that C_{s} has the torsion group \bf Z/3\bf Z for a generic s\in \bf Q and it also contains subfamilies which coincide with the universal families given by Kubert with the torsion groups   \bf Z/6\bf Z, \bf Z/6\bf Z+\bf Z/2\bf Z, \bf Z/9\bf Z or \bf Z/12\bf Z. The cubic curves D_s has torsion \bf Z/3\bf Z+\bf Z/3\bf Z generically but also \bf Z/3\bf Z+\bf Z/6\bf Z for a subfamily which is parametrized by  \bf Q(\sqrt{-3}) .
