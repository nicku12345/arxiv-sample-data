For any odd n, we describe a smooth minimal (i.e. obtained by adding an irreducible hypersurface) compactification \tilde S_n of the quasi-projective homogeneous variety S_{n}=PGL(n+1)/SL(2) that parameterizes the rational normal curves in P^n. We show that \tilde S_{n} is isomorphic to a component of the Maruyama scheme of the semi-stable sheaves on P^n of rank n and Chern polynomial (1+t)^{n+2} and we compute its Betti numbers.   In particular \tilde S_{3} is isomorphic to the variety of nets of quadrics defining twisted cubics, studied by G. Ellinsgrud, R. Piene and S. Str{\o}mme (Space curves, Proc. Conf., LNM 1266).
