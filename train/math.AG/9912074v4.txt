Let G be a reductive group, let Gr=G((t))/G[[t]] be the corresponding affine Grassmannian and let Fl=G((t))/I be the affine flag variety. We construct, following an idea of Belinson, a 1-parametric deformation of the product Gr\times G/B to Fl. We use this construction to produce perverse sheaves on Fl which are central with respect to the convolution product from spherical perverse sheaves on Gr.
