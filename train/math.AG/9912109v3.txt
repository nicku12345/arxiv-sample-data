We study aspects related to Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture in the case of Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties. In a 1996 lecture at Rutgers University, Kontsevich indicated how his proposal implies that the groups of automorphisms of the two types of categories involved in the homological mirror symmetry conjecture should also be identified. Our main results provide an explicit geometric construction of the correspondence between the automorphisms of the two types of categories.
