We introduce symmetrizing operators of the polynomial ring A[x] in the varible x over a ring A. When A is an algebra over a field k these operators are used to characterize the monic polynomials F(x) of degree n in A[x] such that A\otimes_k k[x]_{(x)}/(F(x)) is a free A-module of rank n. We use the characterization to determine the Hilbert scheme parameterizing subschemes of length n of k[x]_{(x)}.
