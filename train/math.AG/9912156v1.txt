The "peak reduction" method is a powerful combinatorial technique with applications in many different areas of mathematics as well as theoretical computer science. It was introduced by Whitehead, a famous topologist and group theorist, who used it to solve an important algorithmic problem concerning automorphisms of a free group. Since then, this method was used to solve numerous problems in group theory, topology, combinatorics, and probably in some other areas as well.   In this paper, we give a survey of what seems to be the first applications of the peak reduction technique in commutative algebra and affine algebraic geometry.
