We construct inductively an equivariant compactification of the algebraic group {\mathbb W}_n of Witt vectors of finite length over a field of characteristic p>0. We obtain smooth projective rational varieties \bar{\mathbb W}_n, defined over \mathbf F_p; the boundary is a divisor whose reduced subscheme has normal crossings.   The Artin-Schreier-Witt isogeny F-1:{\mathbb W}_n\to {\mathbb W}_n extends to a finite cyclic cover {\mathbf\Psi}_n:\bar{\mathbb W}_n\to \bar{\mathbb W}_n of degree p^n ramified at the boundary. This is used to give an extrinsic description of the local behavior of a separable cover of curves in char. p at a wildly ramified point whose inertia group is cyclic.   In an appendix, we give an elementary computation of the conductor of such a covering, which can otherwise be determined using class field theory.
