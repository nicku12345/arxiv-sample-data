Consequences of the Toda equations arising from the conjectural matrix model for the Riemann sphere are investigated. The Toda equations determine the Gromov-Witten descendent potential (including all genera) of the Riemann sphere from the degree 0 part. Degree 0 series computations via Hodge integrals then lead to higher degree predictions by the Toda equations. First, closed series forms for all 1-point invariants of all genera and degrees are given. Second, degree 1 invariants are investigated with new applications to Hodge integrals. Third, a differential equation for the generating function of the classical simple Hurwitz numbers (in all genera and degrees) is found -- the first such equation. All these results depend upon the conjectural Toda equations. Finally, proofs of the Toda equations in genus 0 and 1 are given.
