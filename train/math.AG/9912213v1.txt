For a finite set A of integral vectors, Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinskii defined a system of differential equations with a parameter vector as a D-module, which system is called an A-hypergeometric (or a GKZ hypergeometric) system. Classifying the parameters according to the D-isomorphism classes of their corresponding A-hypergeometric systems is one of the most fundamental problems in the theory. In this paper we give a combinatorial answer for the problem under the assumption that the finite set A lies in a hyperplane off the origin, and illustrate it in two particularly simple cases: the normal case and the monomial curve case.
