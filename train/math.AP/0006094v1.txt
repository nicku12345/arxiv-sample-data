We consider a hyperbolic system of conservation laws u_t + f(u)_x = 0 and u(0,\cdot) = u_0, where each characteristic field is either linearly degenerate or genuinely nonlinear. Under the assumption of coinciding shock and rarefaction curves and the existence of a set of Riemann coordinates w, we prove that there exists a semigroup of solutions u(t) = \mathcal{S}_t u_0, defined on initial data u_0 \in L^\infty. The semigroup \mathcal{S} is continuous w.r.t. time and the initial data u_0 in the L^1_{\text{loc}} topology. Moreover \mathcal{S} is unique and its trajectories are obtained as limits of wave front tracking approximations.
