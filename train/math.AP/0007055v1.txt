We consider the dependence of the entropic solution of a hyperbolic system of conservation laws \[ \{\{array}{c} u_t + f(u)_x = 0 u(0,\cdot) = u_0 \{array} \] on the flux function f. We prove that the solution in Lipschitz continuous w.r.t.~the C^0 norm of the derivative of the perturbation of f. We apply this result to prove the convergence of the solution of the relativistic Euler equation to the classical limit.
