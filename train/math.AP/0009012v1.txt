In this note we consider two different singular limits to hyperbolic system of conservation laws, namely the standard backward schemes for non linear semigroups and the semidiscrete scheme.   Under the assumption that the rarefaction curve of the corresponding hyperbolic system are straight lines, we prove the stability of the solution and the convergence to the perturbed system to the unique solution of the limit system for initial data with small total variation.
