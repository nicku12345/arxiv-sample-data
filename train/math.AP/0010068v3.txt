We show that wave maps from Minkowski space R^{1+n} to a sphere are globally smooth if the initial data is smooth and has small norm in the critical Sobolev space \dot H^{n/2} in the high dimensional case n \geq 5. A major difficulty, not present in the earlier results, is that the \dot H^{n/2} norm barely fails to control L^\infty, potentially causing a logarithmic divergence in the nonlinearity; however, this can be overcome by using co-ordinate frames adapted to the wave map by approximate parallel transport. In the sequel of this paper we address the more interesting two-dimensional case, which is energy-critical.
