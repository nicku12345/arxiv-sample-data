We show that wave maps from Minkowski space \R^{1+n} to a sphere S^{m-1} are globally smooth if the initial data is smooth and has small norm in the critical Sobolev space \dot H^{n/2}, in all dimensions n \geq 2. This generalizes the results in the prequel [math.AP/0010068] of this paper, which addressed the high-dimensional case n \geq 5. In particular, in two dimensions we have global regularity whenever the energy is small, and global regularity for large data is thus reduced to demonstrating non-concentration of energy.
