We consider the 2D quasi-geostrophic model and its two different regularizations. Global regularity results are established for the regularized models with subcritical or critical indices. The proof of Onsager's conjecture concerning weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations and the notion of dissipative solutions of Duchon and Robert are extended to weak solutions of the quasi-geostrophic equation.
