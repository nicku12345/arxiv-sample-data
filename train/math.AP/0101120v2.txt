We prove that the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations on \R^{1+4} relative to the Coulomb gauge are locally well-posed for initial data in H^{1+\epsilon} for all \epsilon > 0. This builds on previous work by Klainerman and Machedon who proved the corresponding result for a model problem derived from the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system by ignoring the elliptic features of the system, as well as cubic terms.
