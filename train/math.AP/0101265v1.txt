In this paper we study homogenization of quasi-linear partial differential equations of the form -\mbox{div}\left( a\left( x,x/\varepsilon _h,Du_h\right) \right) =f_h on \Omega  with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Here the sequence \left( \varepsilon _h\right)  tends to 0 as h\rightarrow \infty  and the map a\left( x,y,\xi \right)  is periodic in y, monotone in \xi  and satisfies suitable continuity conditions. We prove that u_h\rightarrow u weakly in W_0^{1,p}\left( \Omega \right)  as h\rightarrow \infty , where u is the solution of a homogenized problem of the form -\mbox{div}\left( b\left( x,Du\right) \right) =f on \Omega . We also derive an explicit expression for the homogenized operator b and prove some corrector results, i.e. we find \left( P_h\right)  such that Du_h-P_h\left( Du\right) \rightarrow 0 in L^p\left( \Omega, \mathbf{R}^n\right).
