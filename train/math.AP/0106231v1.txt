We present several Liouville type results for the p-Laplacian in \R^N. Suppose that   h is a nonnegative regular function such that  h(x) = a|x|^\gamma\ {\rm for}\ |x|\ {\rm large},\ a>0\ {\rm and}\ \gamma> -p.  We obtain the following non -existence result:   1) Suppose that N>p>1, and u\in W^{1,p}_{loc} (\R^N)\cap {\cal C} (\R^N) is a nonnegative weak solution of  - {\rm div} (|\nabla u|^{p-2 }\nabla u) \geq h(x) u^q \;\;\mbox{in }\; \R^N  . Suppose that p-1< q\leq {(N+\gamma)(p-1)\over N-p} then u\equiv 0.   2) Let N\leq p. If u\in W^{1,p}_{loc} (\R^N)\cap {\cal C} (\R^N) is a weak solution bounded below of -{\rm div} (|\nabla u|^{p-2 }\nabla u)\geq 0 in \R^N then u is constant.   3) Let N>p if u is bounded from below and -{\rm div} (|\nabla u|^{p-2 }\nabla u)=0 in \R^N then u is constant.   4)If  -\Delta_p u+h(x) u^q\leq 0, . If q> p-1, then u\equiv 0.
