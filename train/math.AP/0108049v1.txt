We extend to the case of a system involving p-Laplacians, the monotonicity and symmetry results of Damascelli and Pacella obtained in the case of a scalar p-Laplace equation with 1<p<2. For this purpose, we use the moving hyperplanes method and we suppose that the right hand sides are increasing and locally Lipschitz continuous.
