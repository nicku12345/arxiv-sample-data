In this paper we prove that the 1D Schr\"odinger equation with derivative in the nonlinear term is globally well-posed in H^{s}, for s>\frac12 for data small in L^{2}. To understand the strength of this result one should recall that for s<\frac12 the Cauchy problem is ill-posed, in the sense that uniform continuity with respect to the initial data fails. The result follows from the method of almost conserved energies, an evolution of the ``I-method'' used by the same authors to obtain global well-posedness for s>\frac23. The same argument can be used to prove that any quintic nonlinear defocusing Schr\"odinger equation on the line is globally well-posed for large data in H^{s}, for s>\frac12.
