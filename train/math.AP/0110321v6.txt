We prove almost global existence for multiple speed quasilinear wave equations with quadratic nonlinearities in three spatial dimensions. We prove new results both for Minkowski space and also for nonlinear Dirichlet-wave equations outside of star shaped obstacles. The results for Minkowski space generalize a classical theorem of John and Klainerman. Our techniques only uses the classical invariance of the wave operator under translations, spatial rotations, and scaling. We exploit the O(|x|^{-1}) decay of solutions of the wave equation as opposed to the more difficult O(|t|^{-1}) decay. Accordingly, a key step in our approach is to prove a pointwise estimate of solutions of the wave equations that gives O(1/t) decay of solutions of the inhomomogeneous linear wave equation based in terms of O(1/|x|) estimates for the forcing term.
