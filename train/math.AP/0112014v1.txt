We present a preliminary study of a new phenomena associated with the Euler-Poisson equations -- the so called critical threshold phenomena, where the answer to questions of global smoothness vs. finite time breakdown depends on whether the initial configuration crosses an intrinsic, {O}(1) critical threshold.   We investigate a class of Euler-Poisson equations, ranging from one-dimensional problem with or without various forcing mechanisms to multi-dimensional isotropic models with geometrical symmetry. These models are shown to admit a critical threshold which is reminiscent of the conditional breakdown of waves on the beach; only waves above certain initial critical threshold experience finite-time breakdown, but otherwise they propagate smoothly. At the same time,the asymptotic long time behavior of the solutions remains the same, independent of crossing these initial thresholds.   A case in point is the simple one-dimensional problem where the unforced inviscid Burgers' solution always forms a shock discontinuity except for the non-generic case of increasing initial profile, u_0' \geq 0. In contrast, we show that the corresponding one dimensional Euler-Poisson equation with zero background has global smooth solutions as long as its initial (\rho_0,u_0)- configuration satisfies u_0'\geq -\sqrt{2k\rho_0}, allowing a finite, critical negative velocity gradient. As is typical for such nonlinear convection problems one is led to a Ricatti equation which is balanced here by a forcing acting as a 'nonlinear resonance', and which in turn is responsible for this critical threshold phenomena.
