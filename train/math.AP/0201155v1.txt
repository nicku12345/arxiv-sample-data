Based on the concepts of a generalized critical point and the corresponding generalized P.S. condition introduced by Duong Minh Duc[1], we have proved a new Z_2 index theorem and get a result on multiplicity of generalized critical points. Using the result and a quite standard variational method, it is found that the equation  -\Delta_{H^n} u=|u|^{p-1} u ~ x\in H^n  has infinite positive solutions. Our approach can also be applied to study more general nonlinear problems.
