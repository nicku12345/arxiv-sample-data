We shall be concerned with the Cauchy problem for quasilinear systems in three space dimensions of the form \label{i.1} \partial^2_tu^I-c^2_I\Delta u^I = C^{IJK}_{abc}\partial_c u^J\partial_a\partial_b u^K + B^{IJK}_{ab}\partial_a u^J\partial_b u^K, \quad I=1,..., D.   Here we are using the convention of summing repeated indices, and \partial u denotes the space-time gradient, \partial u=(\partial_0 u, \partial_1 u, \partial_2 u, \partial_3u), with \partial_0=\partial_t, and \partial_j=\partial_{x_j}, j=1,2,3. We shall be in the nonrelativistic case where we assume that the wave speeds c_k are all positive but not necessarily equal.   Using a new pointwise estimate of the M. Keel, H. Smith and the author we shall prove global existence of small amplitude solutions for such equations satisfying a null condition. This generalizes the earlier result of Christodoulou and Klainerman where all the wave speeds are the same. Our approach is related to that of Klainerman; however, since we are in the non-relativistic case we cannot use the Lorentz boost vector fields or the Morawetz vector fields. Instead we exploit both the 1/t decay of linear solutions as well as the much easier to prove 1/|x| decay.
