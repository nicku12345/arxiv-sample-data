Spatial regularity properties of certain global-in-time solutions of the Zakharov system are established. In particular, the evolving solution u(t) is shown to satisfy an estimate \Hsup s {u(t)} \leq C {{|t|}^{(s-1)+}}, where H^s is the standard spatial Sobolev norm. The proof is an adaptation of earlier work on the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation which reduces matters to bilinear estimates.
