We study the long-time behaviour of the focusing cubic NLS on \R in the Sobolev norms H^s for 0 < s < 1. We obtain polynomial growth-type upper bounds on the H^s norms, and also limit any orbital H^s instability of the ground state to polynomial growth at worst; this is a partial analogue of the H^1 orbital stability result of Weinstein. In the sequel to this paper we generalize this result to other nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. Our arguments are based on the ``I-method'' from our earlier papers, which pushes down from the energy norm, as well as an ``upside-down I-method'' which pushes up from the L^2 norm.
