A sufficient condition is derived for a finite-time L_2 singularity of the 3d incompressible Euler equations, making appropriate assumptions on eigenvalues of the Hessian of pressure. Under this condition \lim_{t \to T_*} \sup | \frac{D \o} {Dt} |_{L_2(\vO)} = \infty, where ~ \vO \subset \R3 moves with the fluid. In particular, |{\o}|, |\S_{ij}| , and |\P_{ij}| all become unbounded at one point (x_1,T_1), T_1 being the first blow-up time in L_2.
