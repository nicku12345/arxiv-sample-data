The aim of this short note is to reconsider and to extend a former result of K. Mochizuki on the existence of the scattering operator for wave equations with small dissipative terms.   Contrary to the approach used by Mochizuki we construct the wave operator explicitly in terms of the parametrix construction obtained by a (simplified) diagonalization procedure. The method is based on ODE techniques.
