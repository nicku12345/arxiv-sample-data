In this paper, we show global existence, in spatial dimensions greater than or equal to four, for semilinear wave equations with quadratic nonlinearities exterior to a nontrapping obstacle. This extends the previous work of Shibata-Tsutsumi and Hayashi. Shibata-Tsutsumi showed the result for spatial dimensions greater than or equal to 6, and Hayashi proved the result exterior to a ball.
