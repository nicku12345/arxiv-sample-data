We continue the study (initiated in \cite{ckstt:7}) of the orbital stability of the ground state cylinder for focussing non-linear Schr\"odinger equations in the H^s(\R^n) norm for 1-\eps < s < 1, for small \eps. In the L^2-subcritical case we obtain a polynomial bound for the time required to move away from the ground state cylinder. If one is only in the H^1-subcritical case then we cannot show this, but for defocussing equations we obtain global well-posedness and polynomial growth of H^s norms for s sufficiently close to 1.
