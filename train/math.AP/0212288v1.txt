We study the validity of geometric optics in L^\infty for nonlinear wave equations in three space dimensions whose solutions, pulse like, focus at a point. If the amplitude of the initial data is subcritical, then no nonlinear effect occurs at leading order. If the amplitude of the initial data is sufficiently big, strong nonlinear effects occur; we study the cases where the equation is either dissipative or accretive. When the equation is dissipative, pulses are absorbed before reaching the focal point. When the equation is accretive, the family of pulses becomes unbounded.
