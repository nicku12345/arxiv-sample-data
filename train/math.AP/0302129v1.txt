We study a dissipative nonlinear equation modelling certain features of the Navier-Stokes equations. We prove that the evolution of radially symmetric compactly supported initial data does not lead to singularities in dimensions n\leq 4. For dimensions n>4 we present strong numerical evidence supporting existence of blow-up solutions. Moreover, using the same techniques we numerically confirm a conjecture of Lepin regarding existence of self-similar singular solutions to a semi-linear heat equation.
