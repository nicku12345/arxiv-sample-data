By means of a penalization argument due to del Pino and Felmer, we prove the existence of multi-spike solutions for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations under natural growth conditions. Compared with the semilinear case some difficulties arise, mainly concerning the properties of the limit equation. The study of concentration of the solutions requires a somewhat involved analysis in which a Pucci-Serrin type identity plays an important role.
