We show that all smooth solutions of model non-linear sums of squares of vector fields are locally real analytic. A global result for more general operators is presented in a paper by Makhlouf Derridj and the first author under the title "Global Analytic Hypoellipticity for a Class of Quasilinear Sums of Squares of Vector Fields".
