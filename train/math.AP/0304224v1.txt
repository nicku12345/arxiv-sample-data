We propose a discontinuous finite element approximation for a model of quasi-static growth of brittle fractures in linearly elastic bodies formulated by Francfort and Marigo, and based on the classical Griffith's criterion. We restrict our analysis to the case of anti-planar shear and we consider discontinuous displacements which are piecewise affine with respect to a regular triangulation.
