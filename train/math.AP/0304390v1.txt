In this text, we shall give an outline of some recent results (see \ccite{bahourichemin2} \ccite{bahourichemin3} and \ccite{bahourichemin4}) of local wellposedness for two types of quasilinear wave equations for initial data less regular than what is required by the energy method. To go below the regularity prescribed by the classical theory of strictly hyperbolic equations, we have to use the particular properties of the wave equation. The result concerning the first kind of equations must be understood as a Strichartz estimate for wave operators whose coefficients are only Lipschitz while the result concerning the second type of equations is reduced to the proof of a bilinear estimate for the product of two solutions for wave operators whose coefficients are not very regular. The purpose of this talk is to emphasise the importance of ideas coming from microlocal analysis to prove such results.
