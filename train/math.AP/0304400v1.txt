Resonances, or scattering poles, are complex numbers which mathematically describe meta-stable states: the real part of a resonance gives the rest energy, and its imaginary part, the rate of decay of a meta-stable state. This description emphasizes the quantum mechanical aspects of this concept but similar models appear in many branches of physics, chemistry and mathematics, from molecular dynamics to automorphic forms. In this article we will will describe the recent progress in the study of resonances based on the theory of partial differential equations.
