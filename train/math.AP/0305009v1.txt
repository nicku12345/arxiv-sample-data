We discuss several geometric PDEs and their relationship with Hydrodynamics and classical Electrodynamics. We start from the Euler equations of ideal incompressible fluids that, geometrically speaking, describe geodesics on groups of measure preserving maps with respect to the L^2 metric. Then, we introduce a geometric approximation of the Euler equation, which involves the Monge-Amp\`ere equation and the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transportation theory. This equation can be interpreted as a fully nonlinear correction of the Vlasov-Poisson system that describes the motion of electrons in a uniform neutralizing background through Coulomb interactions. Finally we briefly discuss an equation for generalized extremal surfaces in the 5 dimensional Minkowski space, related to the Born-Infeld equations, from which the Vlasov-Maxwell system of classical Electrodynamics can be formally derived.
