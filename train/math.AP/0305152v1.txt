The primary goal of this paper is to characterize solutions to coupled reaction-diffusion systems. Indeed, we use operators theory to show that under suitable assumptions, then the solutions to the reaction-diffusion equations exist. As applications, we consider a mathematical model arising in Biology and in Chemistry.
