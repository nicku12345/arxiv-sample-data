In this paper a fourth order equation involving critical growth is considered under Navier boundary condition. We give some topological conditions on a given function to ensure the existence of solutions. Our methods involve the study of the critical points at infinity and their contribution to the topology of the level sets of the associated Euler Lagrange functional
