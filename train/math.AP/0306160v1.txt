We bound the difference between solutions u and v of u_t = a\Delta u+\Div_x f+h and v_t = b\Delta v+\Div_x g+k with initial data \phi and  \psi, respectively, by \Vert u(t,\cdot)-v(t,\cdot)\Vert_{L^p(E)}\le A_E(t)\Vert \phi-\psi\Vert_{L^\infty(\R^n)}^{2\rho_p}+ B(t)(\Vert a-b\Vert_{\infty}+ \Vert \nabla_x\cdot f-\nabla_x\cdot g\Vert_{\infty}+ \Vert f_u-g_u\Vert_{\infty} + \Vert h-k\Vert_{\infty})^{\rho_p} \abs{E}^{\eta_p}. Here all functions a, f, and h are smooth and bounded, and may depend on u, x\in\R^n, and t. The functions a and h may in addition depend on \nabla u. Identical assumptions hold for the functions that determine the solutions v. Furthermore, E\subset\R^n is assumed to be a bounded set, and \rho_p and \eta_p are fractions that depend on n and p. The diffusion coefficients a and b are assumed to be strictly positive and the initial data are smooth.
