This paper is concerned with the solvability of some abstract differential equation of type \dot u(t) + Au(t) + Bu(t) \ni f(t), t \in (0,T], u(0) = 0, where A is a linear selfadjoint operator and B is a nonlinear(possibly multi-valued)maximal monotone operator in a (real) Hilbert space {\mathbb H} with the normalization 0 \in B (0). We use the concept of variational sum introduced by H. Attouch, J.-B. Baillon, and M. Th\'era, to investigate solutions to the given abstract differential equation. Several applications will be discussed, among them the case where B = \subdifferential \phi, the subdifferential of a convex semicontinuous proper function \phi.
