We consider the polar factorization of vector valued mappings introduced by Y. Brenier. In the case of a family of mappings depending on a parameter. We investigate the regularity with respect to this parameter of the terms of the polar factorization by constructing some a priori bounds. To do so, we consider the linearization of the associated Monge-Ampere equation which we view as a conservation law.
