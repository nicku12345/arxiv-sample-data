We study the long-time stability of soliton solutions to the Korteweg-deVries equation. We consider solutions u to the KdV with initial data in H^s, 0 \leq s < 1, that are initially close in H^s norm to a soliton. We prove that the possible orbital instability of these ground states is at most polynomial in time. This is an analogue to the H^s orbital instability result of \cite{CKSTT3}, and obtains the same maximal growth rate in t. Our argument is based on the {``}I-method{\rq\rq} used in \cite{CKSTT3} and other papers of Colliander, Keel, Staffilani, Takaoka and Tao, which pushes these H^s functions to the H^1 norm.
