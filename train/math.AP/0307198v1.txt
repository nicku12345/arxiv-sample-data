Given a Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric space (R^n, d_{\hbox{cc}}) generated by vector fields \{X_i\}_{i=1}^m satisfying H\"ormander's condition, we prove in theorem A that any absolute minimizer u\in W^{1,\infty}_{\hbox{cc}}(\Om) to F(v,\Om)=\sup_{x\in\Om}f(x,Xv(x)) is a viscosity solution to the Aronsson equation (1.6), under suitable conditions on f. In particular, any AMLE is a viscosity solution to the subelliptic \infty-Laplacian equation (1.7). If the Carnot-Carath\'edory space is a Carnot group {\bf G} and f is independent of x-variable, we establish in theorem C the uniquness of viscosity solutions to the Aronsson equation (1.13) under suitable conditions on f. As a consequence, the uniqueness of both AMLE and viscosity solutions to the subelliptic \infty-Laplacian equation is established in {\bf G}
