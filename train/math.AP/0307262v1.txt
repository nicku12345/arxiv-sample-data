Let n be a positive integer and let 0 < \alpha < n. In this paper, we continue our study of the integral equation  u(x) = \int_{R^{n}} \frac{u(y)^{(n+\alpha)(n-\alpha)}{|x - y|^{n-\alpha}}dy. We mainly consider singular solutions in subcritical, critical, and super critical cases, and obtain qualitative properties, such as radial symmetry, monotonicity, and upper bounds for the solutions.
