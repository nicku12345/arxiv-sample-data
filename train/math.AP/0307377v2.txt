We study Poincar\'e problem for a linear uniformly parabolic operator \P in a cylinder Q=\Omega\times (0,T). The boundary operator \B is defined by an oblique derivative with respect to a tangential vector field \l defined on the lateral boundary S. The coefficients of \P are supposed to be VMO away from the set of tangency E and to possess higher regularity in x near to E. A unique strong solvability result is obtained in W^{2,1}_p(Q) for all p\in (1,\infty).
