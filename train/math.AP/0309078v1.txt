For any Carnot group \bf G and a bounded domain \Omega\subset \bf G, we prove that viscosity solutions in C(\bar\Om) of the fully nonlinear subelliptic equation F(u,\nabla_h u, \nabla^2_h u)=0 are unique when F\in C(R\times R^m\times {\Cal S}(m)) satisfies (i) F is degenerate subelliptic and decreasing in u or (ii) F is uniformly subelliptic and nonincreasing in u. This extends Jensen's uniqueness theorem from the Euclidean space to the sub-Riemannian setting of the Carnot group.
