In this work, we explain in what sense the generic level set of the constants of motion for the periodic nonlinear Schrodinger equation is an infinite dimensional torus on which each generalized nonlinear Schrodinger flow is reduced to straight line almost periodic motion, and describe how neighboring generic infinite dimensional tori are connected.
