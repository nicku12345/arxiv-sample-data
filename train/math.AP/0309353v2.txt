We show that in dimensions n \geq 6 that one has global regularity for the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations in the Coulomb gauge provided that the critical Sobolev norm \dot H^{n/2-1} \times \dot H^{n/2-2} of the initial data is sufficiently small. These results are analogous to those recently obtained for the high-dimensional wave map equation but unlike the wave map equation, the Coulomb gauge non-linearity cannot be iterated away directly. We shall use a different approach, proving Strichartz estimates for the covariant wave equation. This in turn will be achieved by use of Littlewood-Paley multipliers, and a global parametrix for the covariant wave equation constructed using a truncated, microlocalized Cronstrom gauge.
