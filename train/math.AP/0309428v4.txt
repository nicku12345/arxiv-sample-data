We study the asymptotic behavior of large data radial solutions to the focusing Schr\"odinger equation i u_t + \Delta u = -|u|^2 u in \R^3, assuming globally bounded H^1(\R^3) norm (i.e. no blowup in the energy space). We show that as t \to \pm \infty, these solutions split into the sum of three terms: a radiation term that evolves according to the linear Schr\"odinger equation, a smooth function localized near the origin, and an error that goes to zero in the \dot H^1(\R^3) norm. Furthermore, the smooth function near the origin is either zero (in which case one has scattering to a free solution), or has mass and energy bounded strictly away from zero, and obeys an asymptotic Pohozaev identity. These results are consistent with the conjecture of soliton resolution.
