The Volterra calculus is a simple and powerful pseudodifferential tool for inverting parabolic equations and it has also found many applications in geometric analysis. On the other hand, an important property in the theory of pseudodifferential operators is the asymptotic completeness, which allows us to construct parametrices modulo smoothing operators. In this paper we present new and fairly elementary proofs the asymptotic completeness of the Volterra calculus.
