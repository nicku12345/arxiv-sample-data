We are interested in the life span and the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions to a system governing the motion of a pressureless gas, submitted to a strong, inhomogeneous magnetic field  \e^{-1} B(x), of variable amplitude but fixed direction -- this is a first step in the direction of the study of rotating Euler equations. This leads to the study of a multi--dimensional Burgers type system on the velocity field  u_\e, penalized by a rotating term  \e^{-1} u_\e \wedge B(x). We prove that the unique, smooth solution of this Burgers system exists on a uniform time interval  [0,T]. We also prove that the phase of oscillation of  u_\e is an order one perturbation of the phase obtained in the case of a pure rotation (with no nonlinear transport term),  \e^{-1}B(x)t. Finally going back to the pressureless gas system, we obtain the asymptotics of the density as  \e goes to zero.
