We obtain an L^4 space-time Strichartz inequality for any smooth three-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M,g) which is asymptotically conic at infinity and non-trapping, where u is a solution to the Schr\"odinger equation iu_t + {1/2} \Delta_M u = 0. The exponent H^{1/4}(M) is sharp, by scaling considerations. In particular our result covers asymptotically flat non-trapping manifolds. Our argument is based on the interaction Morawetz inequality introduced by Colliander et al., interpreted here as a positive commutator inequality for the tensor product U(t,z',z'') := u(t,z') u(t,z'') of the solution with itself. We also use smoothing estimates for Schr\"odinger solutions including a new one proved here with weight r^{-1} at infinity and with the gradient term involving only one angular derivative.
