We look for the optimal range of Lebesque exponents for which inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates are valid. We show that it is larger than the one given by admissible exponents for homogeneous estimates. We prove inhomogeneous estimates adopting the abstract setting and interpolation techniques already used by Keel and Tao for the endpoint case of the homogenenous estimates. Applications to Schrodinger equations are given, which extend previous work by Kato.
