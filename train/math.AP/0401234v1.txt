The aim of these notes is to describe some recent results concerning dispersive estimates for principally normal pseudodifferential operators. The main motivation for this comes from unique continuation problems. Such estimates can be used to prove Carleman inequalities, which in turn yield unique continuation results for various partial differential operators with rough potentials.
