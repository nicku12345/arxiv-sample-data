In this paper, we study the existence of multiple solutions to a Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type equation with asymptotically linear term at infinity. In this case, the well-known Ambrosetti-Rabinowtz type condition doesn't hold, hence it is difficult to verify the classical (PS)_c condition. To overcome this difficulty, we use an equivalent version of Cerami's condition, which allows the more general existence result.
