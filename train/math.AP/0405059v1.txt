For n\ge 5 and k\ge 4, we show that any minimizing biharmonic map from \Omega\subset R^n to S^k is smooth off a closed set whose Hausdorff dimension is at most n-5. When n=5 and k=4, for a parameter \lambda\in [0,1] we introduce a \lambda-relaxed energy \H_\lambda for the Hessian energy for maps in W^{2,2}(\Omega,S^4) so that each minimizer u_\lambda of \H_\lambda is also a biharmonic map. We also estabilish the existence and partial regularity of a minimizer of \H_\lambda for \lambda\in [0,1).
