We prove that no finite time blow up can occur for nonlinear Schroedinger equations with quadratic potentials, provided that the potential has a sufficiently strong repulsive component. This is not obvious in general, since the energy associated to the linear equation is not positive. The proof relies essentially on two arguments: global in time Strichartz estimates, and a refined analysis of the linear equation, which makes it possible to use continuity arguments and to control the nonlinear effects.
