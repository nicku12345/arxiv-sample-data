In this paper we describe the propagation of smooth (C^\infty) and Sobolev singularities for the wave equation on smooth manifolds with corners M equipped with a Riemannian metric g. That is, for X=MxR, P=D_t^2-\Delta_M, and u locally in H^1 solving Pu=0 with homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, we show that the wave front set of u is a union of maximally extended generalized broken bicharacteristics. This result is a smooth counterpart of Lebeau's results for the propagation of analytic singularities on real analytic manifolds with appropriately stratified boundary. Our methods rely on b-microlocal positive commutator estimates, thus providing a new proof for the propagation of singularities at hyperbolic points even if M has a smooth boundary (and no corners).
