An explicit formula is given for a fundamental solution for a class of semielliptic operators. The fundamental solution is used to investigate properties of these operators as mappings between weighted function spaces. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for such a mapping to be an isomorphism. Results apply, for example, to elliptic, parabolic, and generalized p-parabolic operators.
