It was shown in 1994, in Oberguggenberger & Rosinger, that very large classes of nonlinear PDEs have solutions which can be assimilated with usual measurable functions on the Euclidean domains of definition of the respective equations. In this paper the regularity of these solutions is significantly improved by showing that they can in fact be assimilated with Hausdorff continuous functions. The method of solution of PDEs is based on the Dedekind order completion of spaces of smooth functions which are defined on the domains of the given equations.
