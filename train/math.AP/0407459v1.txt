We study the asymptotic behavior of the solution of an anisotropic, heterogeneous, linearized elasticity problem in a cylinder whose diameter \epsilon tends to zero. The cylinder is assumed to be fixed (homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition) on the whole of one of its extremities, but only on a small part (of size \epsilon r^\epsilon) of the second one; the Neumann boundary condition is assumed on the remainder of the boundary. We show that the result depends on r^\epsilon, and that there are 3 critical sizes, namely r^\epsilon=\epsilon^3, r^\epsilon=\epsilon, and r^\epsilon=\epsilon^{1/3}, and in total 7 different regimes. We also prove a corrector result for each behavior of r^\epsilon.
