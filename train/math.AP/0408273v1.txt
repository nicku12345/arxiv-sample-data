We obtain the Strichartz inequalities  \| u \|_{L^q_t L^r_x([0,1] \times M)} \leq C \| u(0) \|_{L^2(M)} for any smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M which is asymptotically conic at infinity (with either short-range or long-range metric perturbation) and non-trapping, where u is a solution to the Schr\"odinger equation iu_t + {1/2} \Delta_M u = 0, and 2 < q, r \leq \infty are admissible Strichartz exponents (\frac{2}{q} + \frac{n}{r} = \frac{n}{2}). This corresponds with the estimates available for Euclidean space (except for the endpoint (q,r) = (2, \frac{2n}{n-2}) when n > 2). These estimates imply existence theorems for semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations on M, by adapting arguments from Cazenave and Weissler \cite{cwI} and Kato \cite{kato}.   This result improves on our previous result in \cite{HTW}, which was an L^4_{t,x} Strichartz estimate in three dimensions. It is closely related to the results of Staffilani-Tataru, Burq, Tataru, and Robbiano-Zuily, who consider the case of asymptotically flat manifolds.
