We study nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, posed on a three dimensional Riemannian manifold M. We prove global existence of strong H^1 solutions on M=S^3 and M=S^2\times S^1 as far as the nonlinearity is defocusing and sub-quintic and thus we extend the results of Ginibre-Velo and Bourgain who treated the cases of the Euclidean space \R^3 and the flat torus \T^3 respectively. The main ingredient in our argument is a new set of multilinear estimates for spherical harmonics.
