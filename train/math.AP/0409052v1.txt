We prove existence of small amplitude, 2 pi/omega -periodic in time solutions of completely resonant nonlinear wave equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions for any frequency omega belonging to a Cantor-like set of positive measure and for a generic set of nonlinearities. The proof relies on a suitable Lyapunov-Schmidt decomposition and a variant of the Nash-Moser Implicit Function Theorem.
