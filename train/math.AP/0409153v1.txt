We construct positive solutions of the semilinear elliptic problem \Delta u+ \lambda u + u^p = 0 with Dirichet boundary conditions, in a bounded smooth domain \Omega \subset \R^N (N\geq 4), when the exponent p is supercritical and close enough to \frac{N+2}{N-2} and the parameter \lambda\in\R is small enough. As p\to \frac{N+2}{N-2}, the solutions have multiple blow up at finitely many points which are the critical points of a function whose definition involves Green's function. Our result extends the result of Del Pino, Dolbeault and Musso \cite{DDM} when \Omega is a ball and the solutions are radially symmetric.
