In this paper, the results of Burq and Zworski are further developed to study nonconcentration of eigenfunctions for billiards which have rectangular components: these include the Buminovich billiard, the Sinai billiard, and certain pseudointegrable billiards. The results presented are an application of using a "black box" point of view as presented by the same authors.
