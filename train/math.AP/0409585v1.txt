We consider finite time blowup solutions of the L^2-critical cubic focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on \R^2. Such functions, when in H^1, are known to concentrate a fixed L^2-mass (the mass of the ground state) at the point of blowup. Blowup solutions from initial data that is only in L^2 are known to concentrate at least a small amount of mass. In this paper we consider the intermediate case of blowup solutions from initial data in H^s, with 1 > s > s_Q, where s_Q \le \sQ. Our main result is that such solutions, when radially symmetric, concentrate at least the mass of the ground state at the origin at blowup time.
