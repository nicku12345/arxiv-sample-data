In this paper, we consider radial symmetry property of positive solutions of an integral equation arising from some higher order semi-linear elliptic equations on the whole space \mathbf{R}^n. We do not use the usual way to get symmetric result by using moving plane method. The nice thing in our argument is that we only need a Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type inequality. Our main result is Theorem 1 below.
