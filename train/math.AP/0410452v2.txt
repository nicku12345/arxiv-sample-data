Equation (-\Delta+k^2)u+f(u)=0 in D, u\mid_{\partial D}=0, where k=\const>0 and D\subset\R^3 is a bounded domain, has a solution if f:\R\to\R is a continuous function in the region |u|\geq a, piecewise-continuous in the region |u|\leq a, with finitely many discontinuity points u_j such that f(u_j\pm 0) exist, and   uf(y)\geq 0 for |u|\geq a, where a\geq 0 is an arbitrary fixed number.
