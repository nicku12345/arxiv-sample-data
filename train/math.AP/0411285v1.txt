In this paper we study the problem of bifurcation from the origin of solutions of elliptic Dirichlet problems involving critical Sobolev exponent, defined on a bounded domain \Omega in \mathbb{R} ^N: we prove that the first critical case are N=3, 4 (not only N=3, as just proved by Brezis and Nirenberg), exhibiting two nonexistence results for a class of elliptic problem in these dimensions.
