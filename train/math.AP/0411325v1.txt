We construct the space of solutions to the elliptic Monge-Ampere equation det(D^2 u)=1 in the plane R^2 with n points removed. We show that, modulo equiaffine transformations and for n>1, this space can be seen as an open subset of R^{3n-4}, where the coordinates are described by the conformal equivalence classes of once punctured bounded domains in the complex plane of connectivity n-1. This approach actually provides a constructive procedure that recovers all such solutions to the Monge-Ampere equation, and generalizes a theorem by K. Jorgens.
