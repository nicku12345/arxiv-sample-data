In this paper,we show that spherical bounded energy solution of the defocusing 3D energy critical Schr\"odinger equation with harmonic potential, (i\partial_t + \frac {\Delta}2+\frac {|x|^2}2)u=|u|^4u, exits globally and scatters to free solution in the space \Sigma=H^1\bigcap\mathcal F H^1. We preclude the concentration of energy in finite time by combining the energy decay estimates.
