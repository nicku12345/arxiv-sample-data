These notes are devoted to the notion of well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for nonlinear dispersive equations. We present recent methods for proving ill-posedness type results for dispersive PDE's. The common feature in the analysis is that the proof of such results requires the construction of high frequency approximate solutions on small time intervals (possibly depending on the frequency).
