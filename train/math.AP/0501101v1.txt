An approximation Ansatz for the operator solution, U(z',z), of a hyperbolic first-order pseudodifferential equation, \d_z + a(z,x,D_x) with \Re (a) \geq 0, is constructed as the composition of global Fourier integral operators with complex phases. An estimate of the operator norm in L(H^{(s)},H^{(s)}) of these operators is provided which allows to prove a convergence result for the Ansatz to U(z',z) in some Sobolev space as the number of operators in the composition goes to \infty.
