We are interested in the homogenization of energy like quantities for electromagnetic waves in the high frequency limit for Maxwell's equations with various boundary conditions. We use a scaled variant of H-measures known as semi classical measures or Wigner measures. Firstly, we consider this system in the half space of \R^3 in the time harmonic and with conductor boundary condition at the flat boundary x_3=0. Secondly we consider the same system but with Calderon boundary condition. Thirdly, we consider this system in the curved interface case.
