We are interested in the homogenization of energy like quantities in electromagnetism. We prove a general propagation Theorem for H-measures associated to Maxwell's system, in the full space \Omega =\R^{3}, without boundary conditions. We shall distinguish between two cases: constant coefficient case, and non coefficient-scalar case. In the two cases we give the behaviour of the H-measures associated to this system.
