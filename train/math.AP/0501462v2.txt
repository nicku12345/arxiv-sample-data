We obtain global well-posedness, scattering, uniform regularity, and global L^6_{t,x} spacetime bounds for energy-space solutions to the defocusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in \R\times\R^4. Our arguments closely follow those of Colliander-Keel-Staffilani-Takaoka-Tao, though our derivation of the frequency-localized interaction Morawetz estimate is somewhat simpler. As a consequence, our method yields a better bound on the L^6_{t,x}-norm.
