We consider the Cauchy problem for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations u_t+u\nabla_xu-\Delta u+\nabla p=0, div u=0 in R^d \times R^+ with initial data a\in L^d(R^d), and study in some detail the smoothing effect of the equation. We prove that for T<\infty and for any positive integers n and m we have t^{m+n/2}D^m_tD^{n}_x u\in L^{d+2}(R^d\times (0,T)), as long as the \|u\|_{L^{d+2}_{x,t}(R^d\times (0,T))} stays finite.
