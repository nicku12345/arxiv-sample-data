Let f be a continuous and non-decreasing function such that f>0 on (0,\infty), f(0)=0, \sup \_{s\geq 1}f(s)/s< \infty and let p be a non-negative continuous function. We study the existence and nonexistence of explosive solutions to the equation \Delta u+|\nabla u|=p(x)f(u) in \Omega, where \Omega is either a smooth bounded domain or \Omega=\RR^N. If \Omega is bounded we prove that the above problem has never a blow-up boundary solution. Since f does not satisfy the Keller-Osserman growth condition at infinity, we supply in the case \Omega=\RR^N a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a positive solution that blows up at infinity.
