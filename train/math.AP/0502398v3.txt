In this paper, the scattering and spectral theory of H=\Delta_g+V is developed, where \Delta_g is the Laplacian with respect to a scattering metric g on a compact manifold X with boundary and V\in C^\infty(X) is real; this extends our earlier results in the two-dimensional case. Included in this class of operators are perturbations of the Laplacian on Euclidean space by potentials homogeneous of degree zero near infinity. Much of the particular structure of geometric scattering theory can be traced to the occurrence of radial points for the underlying classical system; a general framework for microlocal analysis at these points forms the main part of the paper.
