We study the semi-classical behavior of the spectral function of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator with short range potential. We prove that the spectral function is a semi-classical Fourier integral operator quantizing the forward and backward flow relations of the system. Under a certain geometric condition we explicitly compute the phase in an oscillatory integral representation of the spectral function.
