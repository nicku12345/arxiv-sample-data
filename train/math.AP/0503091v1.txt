In this article, the operator \Diamond_{B}^{k} is introduced and named as the Bessel diamond operator iterated k times and is defined by  \Diamond_{B}^{k} = [ (B_{x_{1}} + B_{x_{2}} + ... + B_{x_{p}})^{2} - (B_{x_{p + 1}} + ... + B_{x_{p + q}})^{2} ]^{k}, where  p + q = n, B_{x_{i}} = \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{i}^{2}} + \frac{2v_{i}}{x_{i}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}},  where 2v_{i} = 2\alpha_{i} + 1,  \alpha_{i} > - {1/2}  [8], x_{i} > 0, i = 1, 2, ..., n, k is a non-negative integer and n is the dimension of \mathbb{R}_{n}^{+}. In this work we study the elementary solution of the Bessel diamond operator and the elementary solution of the operator \Diamond_{B}^{k} is called the Bessel diamond kernel of Riesz. Then, we study the Fourier--Bessel transform of the elementary solution and also the Fourier--Bessel transform of their convolution.
