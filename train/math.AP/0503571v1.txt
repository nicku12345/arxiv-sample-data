We develop the concept and the calculus of anti-self dual (ASD) Lagrangians which seems inherent to many questions in mathematical physics, geometry, and differential equations. They are natural extensions of gradients of convex functions --hence of self-adjoint positive operators-- which usually drive dissipative systems, but also rich enough to provide representations for the superposition of such gradients with skew-symmetric operators which normally generate unitary flows. They yield variational formulations and resolutions for large classes of non-potential boundary value problems and initial-value parabolic equations. Solutions are minima of functionals of the form I(u)=L(u, \Lambda u) (resp. I(u)=\int_{0}^{T}L(t, u(t), \dot u (t)+\Lambda_{t}u(t))dt) where L is an anti-self dual Lagrangian and where \Lambda_{t} are essentially skew-adjoint operators. However, and just like the self (and antiself) dual equations of quantum field theory (e.g. Yang-Mills) the equations associated to such minima are not derived from the fact they are critical points of the functional I, but because they are also zeroes of the Lagrangian L itself.
