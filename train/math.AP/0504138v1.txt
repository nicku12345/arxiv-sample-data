This work gathers new results concerning the semi-geostrophic equations: existence and stability of measure valued solutions, existence and uniqueness of solutions under certain continuity conditions for the density, convergence to the incompressible Euler equations. Meanwhile, a general technique to prove uniqueness of sufficiently smooth solutions to non-linearly coupled system is introduced, using optimal transportation.
