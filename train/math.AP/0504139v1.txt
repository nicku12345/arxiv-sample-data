We consider in this paper a plasma subject to a strong deterministic magnetic field and we investigate the effect on this plasma of a stochastic electric field. We show that the limit behavior, which corresponds to the transfer of energy from the electric wave to the particles (Landau phenomena), is described by a Spherical Harmonics Expansion (SHE) model.
