We consider the reaction-diffusion equation \[ T_t = T_{xx} + f(T) \] on \bbR with T_0(x) \equiv \chi_{[-L,L]} (x) and f(0)=f(1)=0. In 1964 Kanel' proved that if f is an ignition non-linearity, then T\to 0 as t\to\infty when L<L_0, and T\to 1 when L>L_1. We answer the open question of relation of L_0 and L_1 by showing that L_0=L_1. We also determine the large time limit of T in the critical case L=L_0, thus providing the phase portrait for the above PDE with respect to a 1-parameter family of initial data. Analogous results for combustion and bistable non-linearities are proved as well.
