In this paper we construct a global, continuous flow of solutions to the Camassa-Holm equation on the entire space H^1. Our solutions are conservative, in the sense that the total energy \int (u^2+u_x^2) dx remains a.e. constant in time. Our new approach is based on a distance functional J(u,v), defined in terms of an optimal transportation problem, which satisfies {d\over dt} J(u(t), v(t))\leq \kappa\cdot J(u(t),v(t)) for every couple of solutions. Using this new distance functional, we can construct arbitrary solutions as the uniform limit of multi-peakon solutions, and prove a general uniqueness result.
