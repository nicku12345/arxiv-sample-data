We present some new regularity criteria for ``suitable weak solutions'' of the Navier-Stokes equations near the boundary in dimension three. We prove that suitable weak solutions are H\"older continuous up to the boundary provided that the scaled mixed norm L^{p,q}_{x,t} with 3/p+2/q\leq 2, 2<q\le \infty, (p,q) \not = (3/2,\infty), is small near the boundary. Our methods yield new results in the interior case as well. Partial regularity of weak solutions is also analyzed under some conditions of the Prodi-Serrin type.
