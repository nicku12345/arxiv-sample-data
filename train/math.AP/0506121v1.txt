We establish the uniqueness of the positive solution for equations of the form -\Delta u=au-b(x)f(u) in \Omega, u|\_{\partial\Omega}=\infty. The special feature is to consider nonlinearities f whose variation at infinity is \emph{not regular} (e.g., \exp(u)-1, \sinh(u), \cosh(u)-1, \exp(u)\log(u+1), u^\beta \exp(u^\gamma), \beta\in {\mathbb R}, \gamma>0 or \exp(\exp(u))-e) and functions b\geq 0 in \Omega vanishing on \partial\Omega. The main innovation consists of using Karamata's theory not only in the statement/proof of the main result but also to link the non-regular variation of f at infinity with the blow-up rate of the solution near \partial\Omega.
