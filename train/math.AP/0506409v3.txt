This article is devoted to obtain the \Gamma-limit, as \epsilon tends to zero, of the family of functionals F_{\epsilon}(u)=\int_{\Omega}f\Bigl(x,\frac{x}{\epsilon},..., \frac{x}{\epsilon^n},\nabla u(x)\Bigr)dx, where f=f(x,y^1,...,y^n,z) is periodic in y^1,...,y^n, convex in z and satisfies a very weak regularity assumption with respect to x,y^1,...,y^n. We approach the problem using the multiscale Young measures.
