This paper deals with a class of nonlinear elliptic equations involving a critical power-nonlinearity as well as a potential featuring multiple inverse square singularities. When the poles form a symmetric structure, it is natural we wonder how the symmetry affects such mutual interaction. The present paper means to study this aspect from the point of view of the existence of solutions inheriting the same symmetry properties as the set of singularities.
