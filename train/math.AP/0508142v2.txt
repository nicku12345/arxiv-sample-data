We consider the 2 \times 2 parabolic systems \begin{equation*} u^{\epsilon}_t + A(u^{\epsilon}) u^{\epsilon}_x = \epsilon u^{\epsilon}_{xx} \end{equation*} on a domain (t, x) \in ]0, + \infty[ \times ]0, l[ with Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed at x=0 and at x=l. The matrix A is assumed to be in triangular form and strictly hyperbolic, and the boundary is not characteristic, i.e. the eigenvalues of A are different from 0. We show that, if the initial and boundary data have sufficiently small total variation, then the solution u^{\epsilon} exists for all t \geq 0 and depends Lipschitz continuously in L^1 on the initial and boundary data. Moreover, as \epsilon \to 0^+, the solutions u^{\epsilon}(t) converge in L^1 to a unique limit u(t), which can be seen as the vanishing viscosity solution of the quasilinear hyperbolic system \begin{equation*} u_t + A(u)u_x = 0, \quad x \in ]0, l[. \end{equation*} This solution u(t) depends Lipschitz continuously in L^1 w.r.t the initial and boundary data. We also characterize precisely in which sense the boundary data are assumed by the solution of the hyperbolic system. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 35L65.
