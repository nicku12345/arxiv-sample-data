We establish that the quadratic non-linear Schr\"odinger equation  iu_t + u_{xx} = u^2 where u: \R \times \R \to \C, is locally well-posed in H^s(\R) when s \geq -1 and ill-posed when s < -1. Previous work of Kenig, Ponce and Vega had established local well-posedness for s > -3/4. The local well-posedness is achieved by an iteration using a modification of the standard X^{s,b} spaces. The ill-posedness uses an abstract and general argument relying on the high-to-low frequency cascade present in the non-linearity, and a computation of the first non-linear iterate.
