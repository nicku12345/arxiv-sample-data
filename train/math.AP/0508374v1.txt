We give a condition for the periodic, three dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to be globally wellposed. This condition is not a smallness condition on the initial data, as the data is allowed to be arbitrarily large in the scale invariant space  B^{-1}\_{\infty,\infty}, which contains all the known spaces in which there is a global solution for small data. The smallness condition is rather a nonlinear type condition on the initial data; an explicit example of such initial data is constructed, which is arbitrarily large and yet gives rise to a global, smooth solution.
