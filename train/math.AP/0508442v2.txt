We consider the spectral semi-Galerkin method applied to the nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations. Under certain conditions it is known that the approximate solutions constructed through this method converge to a global strong solution of these equations. Here, we derive an optimal uniform in time error estimate in the H^1 norm for the velocity. We also derive an error estimate for the density in some spaces L^r.
