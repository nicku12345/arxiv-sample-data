We prove existence of solutions for the Benjamin-Ono equation with data in H^s(\R), s>0. Thanks to conservation laws, this yields global solutions for H^\frac 1 2(\R) data, which is the natural ``finite energy'' class. Moreover, inconditional uniqueness is obtained in L^\infty_t(H^\frac 1 2(\R)), which includes weak solutions, while for s>\frac 3 {20}, uniqueness holds in a natural space which includes the obtained solutions.
