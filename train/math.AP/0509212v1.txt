We consider solutions to linear parabolic equations with initial data decaying at spatial infinity. For a class of advection-diffusion equations with a spatially dependent velocity field, we study the behavior of solutions as time tends to infinity. We characterize velocity fields, so that positive solutions decay or lift-off at spatial infinity as time tends to infinity. This addresses the question of stability of the zero solution for decaying perturbations.
