We investigate nonlinear dynamics near an unstable constant equilibrium in the classical Keller-Segel model. Given any general perturbation of magnitude \delta, we prove that its nonlinear evolution is dominated by the corresponding linear dynamics along a fixed finite number of fastest growing modes, over a time period of ln(1/\delta). Our result can be interpreted as a rigourous mathematical characterization for early pattern formation in the Keller-Segel model.
