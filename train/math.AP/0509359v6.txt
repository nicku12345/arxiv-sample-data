We study nonlinear dispersive wave systems described by hyperbolic PDE's in R^{d} and difference equations on the lattice Z^{d}. The systems involve two small parameters: one is the ratio of the slow and the fast time scales, and another one is the ratio of the small and the large space scales. We show that a wide class of such systems, including nonlinear Schrodinger and Maxwell equations, Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model and many other not completely integrable systems, satisfy a superposition principle. The principle essentially states that if a nonlinear evolution of a wave starts initially as a sum of generic wavepackets (defined as almost monochromatic waves), then this wave with a high accuracy remains a sum of separate wavepacket waves undergoing independent nonlinear evolution. The time intervals for which the evolution is considered are long enough to observe fully developed nonlinear phenomena for involved wavepackets. In particular, our approach provides a simple justification for numerically observed effect of almost non-interaction of solitons passing through each other without any recourse to the complete integrability. Our analysis does not rely on any ansatz or common asymptotic expansions with respect to the two small parameters but it uses rather explicit and constructive representation for solutions as functions of the initial data in the form of functional analytic series.
