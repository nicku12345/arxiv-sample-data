With derive sharp spectral asymptotics (with the remainder estimate O(\mu ^{-1}h^{1-d}+\mu ^{\frac{d} {2}-1}h^{1-\frac{d}{2}}) for d-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with a strong magnetic field; here h and \mu are Plank and binding constants respectively and magnetic intensity matrix has full rank at each point.   In comparison with version 1 of 4.5 year ago this version contains more results (we also study some degenerations), improvements and some minor corrections.
