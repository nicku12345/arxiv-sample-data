This paper provides an extension for a function u \in BV_H(\Omega) to a function u_0 \in BV_H(G) when \Omega is ``H-admissible,'' and G is a step 2 Carnot group. It is shown that H-admissible domains include non-characteristic domains and domains in groups of Heisenberg type which have a partial symmetry about characteristic points. An example is given of a domain that is C^{1,\alpha}, \alpha <1, that is not H-admissible. Further, when \Omega is H-admissible a trace theorem is proved for u \in BV_H(\Omega).
