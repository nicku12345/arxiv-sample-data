We obtain an estimate for the H\"older continuity exponent for weak solutions to the following elliptic equation in divergence form: \[ \mathrm{div}(A(x)\nabla u)=0 \qquad\mathrm{in\}\Omega, \] where \Omega is a bounded open subset of \R^2 and, for every x\in\Omega, A(x) is a matrix with bounded measurable coefficients. Such an estimate "interpolates" between the well-known estimate of Piccinini and Spagnolo in the isotropic case A(x)=a(x)I, where a is a bounded measurable function, and our previous result in the unit determinant case \det A(x)\equiv1. Furthermore, we show that our estimate is sharp. Indeed, for every \tau\in[0,1] we construct coefficient matrices A_\tau such that A_0 is isotropic and A_1 has unit determinant, and such that our estimate for A_\tau reduces to an equality, for every \tau\in[0,1].
