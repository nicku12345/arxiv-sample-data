Let \Omega be a domain in \mathbb{R}^d, d\geq 2, and 1<p<\infty. Fix V\in L_{\mathrm{loc}}^\infty(\Omega). Consider the functional Q and its G\^{a}teaux derivative Q^\prime given by Q(u):=\int_\Omega (|\nabla u|^p+V|u|^p)\dx, \frac{1}{p}Q^\prime (u):=-\nabla\cdot(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)+V|u|^{p-2}u. If Q\ge 0 on C_0^{\infty}(\Omega), then either there is a positive continuous function W such that \int W|u|^p \mathrm{d}x\leq Q(u) for all u\in C_0^{\infty}(\Omega), or there is a sequence u_k\in C_0^{\infty}(\Omega) and a function v>0 satisfying Q^\prime (v)=0, such that Q(u_k)\to 0, and u_k\to v in L^p_\mathrm{loc}(\Omega). In the latter case, v is (up to a multiplicative constant) the unique positive supersolution of the equation Q^\prime (u)=0 in \Omega, and one has for Q an inequality of Poincar\'e type: there exists a positive continuous function W such that for every \psi\in C_0^\infty(\Omega) satisfying \int \psi v \mathrm{d}x \neq 0 there exists a constant C>0 such that C^{-1}\int W|u|^p \mathrm{d}x\le Q(u)+C|\int u \psi \mathrm{d}x|^p for all u\in C_0^\infty(\Omega). As a consequence, we prove positivity properties for the quasilinear operator Q^\prime that are known to hold for general subcritical resp. critical second-order linear elliptic operators.
