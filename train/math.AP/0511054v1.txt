We prove new velocity averaging results for second-order multidimensional equations of the general form, \op(\nabla_x,v)f(x,v)=g(x,v) where \op(\nabla_x,v):=\bba(v)\cdot\nabla_x-\nabla_x^\top\cdot\bbb(v)\nabla_x. These results quantify the Sobolev regularity of the averages, \int_vf(x,v)\phi(v)dv, in terms of the non-degeneracy of the set \{v: |\op(\ixi,v)|\leq \delta\} and the mere integrability of the data, (f,g)\in (L^p_{x,v},L^q_{x,v}). Velocity averaging is then used to study the \emph{regularizing effect} in quasilinear second-order equations, \op(\nabla_x,\rho)\rho=S(\rho) using their underlying kinetic formulations, \op(\nabla_x,v)\chi_\rho=g_{{}_S}. In particular, we improve previous regularity statements for nonlinear conservation laws, and we derive completely new regularity results for convection-diffusion and elliptic equations driven by degenerate, non-isotropic diffusion.
