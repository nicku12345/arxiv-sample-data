We undertake a comprehensive study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation  i u_t +\Delta u = \lambda_1|u|^{p_1} u+ \lambda_2 |u|^{p_2} u,  where u(t,x) is a complex-valued function in spacetime \R_t\times\R^n_x, \lambda_1 and \lambda_2 are nonzero real constants, and 0<p_1<p_2\le \frac 4{n-2}. We address questions related to local and global well-posedness, finite time blowup, and asymptotic behaviour. Scattering is considered both in the energy space H^1(\R^n) and in the pseudoconformal space \Sigma:=\{f\in H^1(\R^n); xf\in L^2(\R^n)\}. Of particular interest is the case when both nonlinearities are defocusing and correspond to the L_x^2-critical, respectively \dot H^1_x-critical NLS, that is, \lambda_1, \lambda_2>0 and p_1=\frac{4}{n}, p_2=\frac{4}{n-2}. The results at the endpoint p_1 = \frac{4}{n} are conditional on a conjectured global existence and spacetime estimate for the L^2_x-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.   As an off-shoot of our analysis, we also obtain a new, simpler proof of scattering in H^1_x for solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation  i u_t +\Delta u = |u|^{p} u,  with \frac{4}{n}<p<\frac{4}{n-2}, which was first obtained by J. Ginibre and G. Velo, \cite{gv:scatter}.
