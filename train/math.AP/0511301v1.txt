The paper is devoted to the study of quasi-static brittle crack evolution. We work under the following assumptions: a linear elastic body, with or without initial cracks inside, evolves in a quasi-static manner under an imposed path of boundary displacements. During its evolution cracks with unprescribed geometry may appear and/or grow.   This is an alternative version of the published article [Bu3], containing an improved Mumford-Shah model based on the functional K2, a generalization of the integral J of Rice.
