We prove that the Cauchy problem of the Schr\"odinger - Korteweg - deVries (NLS-KdV) system on \mathbb{T} is globally well-posed for initial data (u_0,v_0) below the energy space H^1\times H^1. More precisely, we show that the non-resonant NLS-KdV is globally well-posed for initial data (u_0,v_0)\in H^s(\mathbb{T})\times H^s(\mathbb{T}) with s>11/13 and the resonant NLS-KdV is globally well-posed for initial data (u_0,v_0)\in H^s(\mathbb{T})\times H^s(\mathbb{T}) with s>8/9. The idea of the proof of this theorem is to apply the I-method of Colliander, Keel, Staffilani, Takaoka and Tao in order to improve the results of Arbieto, Corcho and Matheus concerning the global well-posedness of the NLS-KdV on \mathbb{T} in the energy space H^1\times H^1.
