We study a reaction-diffusion equation with an integral term describing nonlocal consumption of resources. We show that a homogeneous equilibrium can lose its stability resulting in appearance of stationary spatial structures. It is a new mechanism of pattern formation in population dynamics that can explain emergence of biological species due to intra-specific competition and random mutations.Travelling waves connecting an unstable homogeneous equilibrium and a periodic in space stationary solution are studied numerically.
