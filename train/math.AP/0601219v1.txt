In this paper we are interested with a strongly coupled system of partial differential equations that modelizes free convection in a two-dimensional bounded domain filled with a fluid saturated porous medium. This model is inspired by the one of free convection near a semi-infinite impermeable vertical flat plate embedded in a fluid saturated porous medium. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for small data in some unusual spaces.
