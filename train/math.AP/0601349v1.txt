It is shown that the theory of real symmetric second-order elliptic operators in divergence form on \Ri^d can be formulated in terms of a regular strongly local Dirichlet form irregardless of the order of degeneracy. The behaviour of the corresponding evolution semigroup S_t can be described in terms of a function (A,B) \mapsto d(A ;B)\in[0,\infty] over pairs of measurable subsets of \Ri^d. Then \[ |(\phi_A,S_t\phi_B)|\leq e^{-d(A;B)^2(4t)^{-1}}\|\phi_A\|_2\|\phi_B\|_2 \] for all t>0 and all \phi_A\in L_2(A), \phi_B\in L_2(B). Moreover S_tL_2(A)\subseteq L_2(A) for all t>0 if and only if d(A ;A^c)=\infty where A^c denotes the complement of A.
