In the paper, G. Alessandrini and L. Rondi, ``Determining a sound-soft polyhedral scatterer by a single far-field measurement'', Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 133 (2005), pp. 1685-1691, on the determination of a sound-soft polyhedral scatterer by a single far-field measurement, the proof of Proposition 3.2 is incomplete. In this corrigendum we provide a new proof of the same proposition which fills the previous gap.
