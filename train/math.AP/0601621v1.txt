In this paper we study uniqueness properties of solutions of the k-generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation.   Our goal is to obtain sufficient conditions on the behavior of the difference u_1-u_2 of two solutions u_1, u_2 of the equation at two different times t_0=0 and t_1=1 which guarantee that u_1\equiv u_2.
