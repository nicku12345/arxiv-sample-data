We consider a class of stationary viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations as  \left\{\begin{array}{l} \la u-{\rm div}(A(x) \nabla u)=H(x,\nabla u)\mbox{in }\Omega, u=0{on}\partial\Omega\end{array} \right.  where \la\geq 0, A(x) is a bounded and uniformly elliptic matrix and H(x,\xi) is convex in \xi and grows at most like |\xi|^q+f(x), with 1 < q < 2 and f \in \elle {\frac N{q'}}. Under such growth conditions solutions are in general unbounded, and there is not uniqueness of usual weak solutions. We prove that uniqueness holds in the restricted class of solutions satisfying a suitable energy--type estimate, i.e. (1+|u|)^{\bar q-1} u\in \acca, for a certain (optimal) exponent \bar q. This completes the recent results in \cite{GMP}, where the existence of at least one solution in this class has been proved.
