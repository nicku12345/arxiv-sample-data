Asymptotic formulae for Green's kernels G_\epsilon({\bf x}, {\bf y}) of various boundary value problems for the Laplace operator are obtained in regularly perturbed domains and certain domains with small singular perturbations of the boundary, as \epsilon \to 0. The main new feature of these asymptotic formulae is their uniformity with respect to the independent variables {\bf x} and {\bf y}.
