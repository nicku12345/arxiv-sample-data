In this paper we establish a log log-type estimate which shows that in dimension n\geq 3 the magnetic field and the electric potential of the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation depends stably on the Dirichlet to Neumann (DN) map even when the boundary measurement is taken only on a subset that is slightly larger than half of the boundary \partial\Omega. Furthermore, we prove that in the case when the measurement is taken on all of \partial\Omega one can establish a better estimate that is of log-type. The proofs involve the use of the complex geometric optics (CGO) solutions of the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation constructed in \cite{sun uhlmann} then follow a similar line of argument as in \cite{alessandrini}. In the partial data estimate we follow the general strategy of \cite{hw} by using the Carleman estimate established in \cite{FKSU} and a continuous dependence result for analytic continuation developed in \cite{vessella}.
