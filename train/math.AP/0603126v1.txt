We prove the nonexistence of local self-similar solutions of the three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The local self-similar solutions we consider here are different from the global self-similar solutions. The self-similar scaling is only valid in an inner core region which shrinks to a point dynamically as the time, t, approaches the singularity time, T. The solution outside the inner core region is assumed to be regular. Under the assumption that the local self-similar velocity profile converges to a limiting profile as t \to T in L^p for some p \in (3,\infty), we prove that such local self-similar blow-up is not possible for any finite time.
