We describe a variant of the dressing method giving alternative representation of multidimensional nonlinear PDE as a system of   Integro-Differential Equations (IDEs) for spectral and dressing functions. In particular, it becomes single linear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) with potentials expressed through the field of the nonlinear PDE. The absence of linear overdetermined system associated with nonlinear PDE creates an obstacle to obtain evolution of the spectral data (or dressing functions): evolution is defined by nonlinear IDE (or PDE in particular case). As an example, we consider generalization of the dressing method applicable to integrable (2+1)-dimensional N-wave and Davey-Stewartson equations. Although represented algorithm does not supply an analytic particular solutions, this approach may have a perspective development.
