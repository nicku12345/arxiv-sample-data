We consider a second order operator with analytic coefficients whose principal symbol vanishes exactly to order two on a symplectic real analytic manifold. We assume that the first (non degenerate) eigenvalue vanishes on a symplectic submanifold of the characteristic manifold. In the C^\infty framework this situation would mean a loss of 3/2 derivatives. We prove that this operator is analytic hypoelliptic. The main tool is the FBI transform. A case in which C^\infty hypoellipticity fails is also discussed.
