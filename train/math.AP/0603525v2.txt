We provide the classification of eternal (or ancient) solutions of the two-dimensional Ricci flow, which is equivalent to the fast diffusion equation  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \Delta \log u  on  \R^2 \times \R. We show that, under the necessary assumption that for every t \in \R, the solution u(\cdot, t) defines a complete metric of bounded curvature and bounded width, u is a gradient soliton of the form  U(x,t) = \frac{2}{\beta (|x-x_0|^2 + \delta e^{2\beta t})}, for some x_0 \in \R^2 and some constants \beta >0 and \delta >0.
