We prove low-regularity global well-posedness for the 1d Zakharov system and 3d Klein-Gordon-Schr\"odinger system, which are systems in two variables u:\mathbb{R}_x^d\times \mathbb{R}_t \to \mathbb{C} and n:\mathbb{R}^d_x\times \mathbb{R}_t\to \mathbb{R}. The Zakharov system is known to be locally well-posed in (u,n)\in L^2\times H^{-1/2} and the Klein-Gordon-Schr\"odinger system is known to be locally well-posed in (u,n)\in L^2\times L^2. Here, we show that the Zakharov and Klein-Gordon-Schr\"odinger systems are globally well-posed in these spaces, respectively, by using an available conservation law for the L^2 norm of u and controlling the growth of n via the estimates in the local theory.
