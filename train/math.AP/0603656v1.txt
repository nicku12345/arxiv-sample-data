We study the global existence and space-time asymptotics of solutions for a class of nonlocal parabolic semilinear equations. Our models include the Nernst-Planck and the Debye-Hukel drift-diffusion systems as well as parabolic-elliptic systems of chemotaxis. In the case of a model of self-gravitating particles, we also give a result on the finite time blow up of solutions with localized and oscillating complex-valued initial data, using a method by S. Montgomery-Smith.
