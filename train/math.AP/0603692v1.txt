We consider the L^{2}-critical quintic focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on {\bf R}. It is well known that H^{1} solutions of the aforementioned equation blow up in finite time. In higher dimensions, for H^{1} spherically symmetric blow-up solutions of the L^{2}-critical focusing NLS, there is a minimal amount of concentration of the L^{2}-norm (the mass of the ground state) at the origin. In this paper we prove the existence of a similar phenomenon for the one-dimensional case and rougher initial data, (u_{0}\in H^{s}, s<1), without any additional assumption.
