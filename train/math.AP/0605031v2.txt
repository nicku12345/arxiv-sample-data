We consider asymptotic stability of a small solitary wave to supercritical 1-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations  iu_t+u_{xx}=Vu\pm |u|^{p-1}u \quad\text{for (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R},} in the energy class. This problem was studied by Gustafson-Nakanishi-Tsai \cite{GNT} in the 3-dimensional case using the endpoint Strichartz estimate.   To prove asymptotic stability of solitary waves, we need to show that a dispersive part v(t,x) of a solution belongs to L^2_t(0,\infty;X) for some space X. In the 1-dimensional case, this property does not follow from the Strichartz estimate alone.   In this paper, we prove that the local smoothing effect of Kato type holds global in time and combine this estimate with the Strichartz estimate to show \|(1+x^2)^{-3/4}v\|_{L^\infty_xL^2_t}<\infty, which implies the asymptotic stability of a solitary wave.
