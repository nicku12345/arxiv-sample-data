We study instability of a vortex soliton e^{i(m\theta+\omega t)}\phi_{\omega,m}(r) to iu_t+\Delta u+|u|^{p-1}u=0,\quad\text{for x\in\R^n, t>0,} where n=2, m\in\N and (r,\theta) are polar coordinates in \R^2. Grillakis \cite{Gr} proved that every radially standing wave solutions are unstable if p>1+4/n. However, we do not have any examples of unstable standing wave solutions in the subcritical case (p<1+n/4).   Suppose \phi_{\omega,m} is nonnegative. We investigate a limiting profile of \phi_{\omega,m} as m\to\infty and prove that for every p>1, there exists an m_*\in \N such that for m\ge m_*, a vortex soliton e^{i(m\theta+\omega t)}\phi_{\omega,m}(r) becomes unstable to the perturbations of the form e^{i(m+j)\theta}v(r) with 1\ll j\ll m.
