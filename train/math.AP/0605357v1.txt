We show that the quartic generalised KdV equation  u_t + u_{xxx} + (u^4)_x = 0 is globally wellposed for data in the critical (scale-invariant) space \dot H^{-1/6}_x(\R) with small norm (and locally wellposed for large norm), improving a result of Gr\"unrock. As an application we obtain scattering results in H^1_x(\R) \cap \dot H^{-1/6}_x(\R) for the radiation component of a perturbed soliton for this equation, improving the asymptotic stability results of Martel and Merle.
