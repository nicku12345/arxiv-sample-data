We address the decay of the norm of weak solutions to the 2D dissipative quasi-geostrophic equation. When the initial data is in L^2 only, we prove that the L^2 norm tends to zero but with no uniform rate, that is, there are solutions with arbitrarily slow decay. For the initial data in L^p \cap L^2, with 1 \leq p < 2, we are able to obtain a uniform decay rate in L^2. We also prove that when the L^{\frac{2}{2 \alpha -1}} norm of the initial data is small enough, the L^q norms, for q > \frac{2}{2 \alpha -1} have uniform decay rates. This result allows us to prove decay for the L^q norms, for q \geq \frac{2}{2 \alpha -1}, when the initial data is in L^2 \cap L^{\frac{2}{2 \alpha -1}}.
