Nonlinear elliptic system for generating adaptive quadrilateral meshes in curved domains is presented. Presented technique has been implemented in the C++ language. The included software package can write the converged meshes in the GMV and Matlab formats. Since, grid adaptation is required for numerically capturing important characteristics of a process such as boundary layers. So, the presented technique and the software package can be a useful tool.
