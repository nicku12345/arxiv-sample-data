We use microlocal and paradifferential techniques to obtain L^8 norm bounds for spectral clusters associated to elliptic second order operators on two-dimensional manifolds with boundary. The result leads to optimal L^q bounds, in the range 2\le q\le\infty, for L^2-normalized spectral clusters on bounded domains in the plane and, more generally, for two-dimensional compact manifolds with boundary. We also establish new sharp L^q estimates in higher dimensions for a range of exponents \bar{q}_n\le q\le \infty.
