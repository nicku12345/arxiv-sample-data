We perform a multiscale analysis for the elastic energy of a n-dimensional bilayer thin film of thickness 2\delta whose layers are connected through an \epsilon-periodically distributed contact zone. Describing the contact zone as a union of (n-1)-dimensional balls of radius r\ll \epsilon (the holes of the sieve) and assuming that \delta \ll \epsilon, we show that the asymptotic memory of the sieve (as \epsilon \to 0) is witnessed by the presence of an extra interfacial energy term. Moreover we find three different limit behaviors (or regimes) depending on the mutual vanishing rate of \delta and r. We also give an explicit nonlinear capacitary-type formula for the interfacial energy density in each regime.
