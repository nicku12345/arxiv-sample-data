In this paper, we consider the Klein-Gordon-Schr\"{o}dinger system with the higher order Yukawa coupling in  \mathbb{R}^{1+1} , and prove the local and global wellposedness in L^2\times H^{1/2}. The method to be used is adapted from the scheme originally by Colliander J., Holmer J., Tzirakis N. \cite{CoHT06} to use the available L^2 conservation law of u and control the growth of n via the estimates in the local theory.
