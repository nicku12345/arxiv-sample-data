We establish global regularity for the logarithmically energy-supercritical wave equation \Box u = u^5 \log(2+u^2) in three spatial dimensions for spherically symmetric initial data, by modifying an argument of Ginibre, Soffer and Velo \cite{gsv} for the energy-critical equation. This example demonstrates that critical regularity arguments can penetrate very slightly into the supercritical regime.
