Let u_t=\nabla^2 u-q(x)u:=Lu in D\times [0,\infty), where D\subset R^3 is a bounded domain with a smooth connected boundary S, and q(x)\in L^2(S) is a real-valued function with compact support in D. Assume that u(x,0)=0, u=0 on S_1\subset S, u=a(s,t) on S_2=S\setminus S_1, where a(s,t)=0 for t>T, a(s,t)\not\equiv 0, a\in C([0,T];H^{3/2}(S_2)) is arbitrary.   Given the extra data u_N|_{S_2}=b(s,t), for each a\in C([0,T];H^{3/2}(S_2)), where N is the outer normal to S, one can find q(x) uniquely. A similar result is obtained for the heat equation u_t=\mathcal{L} u:=%\triangledown \nabla \cdot (a \nabla u).   These results are based on new versions of Property C.
