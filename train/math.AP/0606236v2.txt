We make two observations concerning the generalised Korteweg de Vries equation u_t + u_{xxx} = \mu (|u|^{p-1} u)_x. Firstly we give a scaling argument that shows, roughly speaking, that any quantitative scattering result for L^2-critical equation (p=5) automatically implies an analogous scattering result for the L^2-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation iu_t + u_{xx} = \mu |u|^4 u. Secondly, in the defocusing case \mu > 0 we present a new dispersion estimate which asserts, roughly speaking, that energy moves to the left faster than the mass, and hence strongly localised soliton-like behaviour at a fixed scale cannot persist for arbitrarily long times.
