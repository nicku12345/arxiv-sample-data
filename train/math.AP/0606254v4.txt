We interpret the lens transformation (a variant of the pseudoconformal transformation) as a pseudoconformal compactification of spacetime, which converts the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) without potential with a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with attractive harmonic potential. We then discuss how several existing results about NLS can be placed in this compactified setting, thus offering a new perspective to view this theory.
