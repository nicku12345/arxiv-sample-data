n a number of papers it was shown that there are one-dimensional systems such that they contain solutions with, so called, overcompressive singular shock waves besides the usual elementary waves (shock and rarefaction ones as well as contact discontinuities). One can see their definition for a general 2 \times 2 system with fluxes linear in one of dependent variables in \cite{Ned1}. This paper is devoted to examining their interactions with themselves and elementary waves. After a discussion of systems given in a general form, a complete analysis will be given for the ion-acoustic system.
