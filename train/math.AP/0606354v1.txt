The present paper deals with the following hyperbolic--elliptic coupled system, modelling dynamics of a gas in presence of radiation, u_{t}+ f(u)_{x} +Lq_{x}=0, -q_{xx} + Rq +G\cdot u_{x}=0, where u\in\R^{n}, q\in\R and R>0, G, L\in\R^{n}. The flux function f : \R^n\to\R^n is smooth and such that \nabla f has n distinct real eigenvalues for any u. The problem of existence of admissible radiative shock wave is considered, i.e. existence of a solution of the form (u,q)(x,t):=(U,Q)(x-st), such that (U,Q)(\pm\infty)=(u_\pm,0), and u_\pm\in\R^n, s\in\R define a shock wave for the reduced hyperbolic system, obtained by formally putting L=0. It is proved that, if u_- is such that \nabla\lambda_{k}(u_-)\cdot r_{k}(u_-)\neq 0,(where \lambda_k denotes the k-th eigenvalue of \nabla f and r_k a corresponding right eigenvector) and (\ell_{k}(u_{-})\cdot L) (G\cdot r_{k}(u_{-})) >0, then there exists a neighborhood \mathcal U of u_- such that for any u_+\in{\mathcal U}, s\in\R such that the triple (u_{-},u_{+};s) defines a shock wave for the reduced hyperbolic system, there exists a (unique up to shift) admissible radiative shock wave for the complete hyperbolic--elliptic system. Additionally, we are able to prove that the profile (U,Q) gains smoothness when the size of the shock |u_+-u_-| is small enough, as previously proved for the Burgers' flux case. Finally, the general case of nonconvex fluxes is also treated, showing similar results of existence and regularity for the profiles.
