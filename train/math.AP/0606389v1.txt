The Vlasov-Poisson system describes interacting systems of collisionless particles. For solutions with small initial data in three dimensions it is known that the spatial density of particles decays like t^{-3} at late times. In this paper this statement is refined to show that each derivative of the density which is taken leads to an extra power of decay so that in N dimensions for N\ge 3 the derivative of the density of order k decays like t^{-N-k}. An asymptotic formula for the solution at late times is also obtained.
