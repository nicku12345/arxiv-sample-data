We prove global well-posedness and scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power-type nonlinearity \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} i u_t +\Delta u = |u|^p u, \quad \frac{4}{n}<p<\frac{4}{n-2}, u(0,x) = u_0(x)\in H^s(\R^n), \quad n\geq 3, \end{cases} \end{equation*} below the energy space, i.e., for s<1. In \cite{ckstt:low7}, J. Colliander, M. Keel, G. Staffilani, H. Takaoka, and T. Tao established polynomial growth of the H^s_x-norm of the solution, and hence global well-posedness for initial data in H^s_x, provided s is sufficiently close to 1. However, their bounds are insufficient to yield scattering. In this paper, we use the \emph{a priori} interaction Morawetz inequality to show that scattering holds in H^s(\R^n) whenever s is larger than some value 0<s_0(n,p)<1.
