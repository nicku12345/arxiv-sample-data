We consider the focusing mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and prove that blowup solutions to this equation with initial data in H^s(\R^d), s > s_0(d) and d\geq 3, concentrate at least the mass of the ground state at the blowup time. This extends recent work by J. Colliander, S. Raynor, C. Sulem, and J. D. Wright, \cite{crsw}, T. Hmidi and S. Keraani, \cite{hk}, and N. Tzirakis, \cite{tzirakis}, on the blowup of the two-dimensional and one-dimensional mass-critical focusing NLS below the energy space to all dimensions d\ge 3.
