In the Dirac operator framework we characterize and estimate the ground state energy of relativistic hydrogenic atoms in a constant magnetic field and describe the asymptotic regime corresponding to a large field strength using relativistic Landau levels. We also define and estimate a critical magnetic field beyond which stability is lost.
