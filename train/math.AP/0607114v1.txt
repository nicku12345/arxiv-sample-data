We present new interior regularity criteria for suitable weak solutions of the 3-D Navier-Stokes equations: a suitable weak solution is regular near an interior point z if either the scaled L^{p,q}_{x,t}-norm of the velocity with 3/p+2/q\leq 2, 1\leq q\leq \infty, or the L^{p,q}_{x,t}-norm of the vorticity with 3/p+2/q\leq 3, 1 \leq q < \infty, or the L^{p,q}_{x,t}-norm of the gradient of the vorticity with 3/p+2/q\leq 4, 1 \leq q, 1 \leq p, is sufficiently small near z.
