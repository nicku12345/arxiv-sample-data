We derive a mathematical model for eddy currents in two dimensional geometries where the conductors are thin domains. We assume that the current flows in the x\_3-direction and the inductors are domains with small diameters of order O(\epsilon). The model is derived by taking the limit \epsilon\to 0. A convergence rate of O(\epsilon^\alpha) with 0<\alpha<1/2 in the L^2--norm is shown as well as weak convergence in the W^{1,p} spaces for 1< p <2.
