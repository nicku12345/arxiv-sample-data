Let {\cal A}(x;D_x) be a second-order linear differential operator in divergence form. We prove that the operator {\l}I- {\cal A}(x;D_x), where \l\in\csp and I stands for the identity operator, is closed and injective when {\rm Re}\l is large enough and the domain of {\cal A}(x;D_x) consists of a special class of weighted Sobolev function spaces related to conical open bounded sets of \rsp^n, n \ge 1.
