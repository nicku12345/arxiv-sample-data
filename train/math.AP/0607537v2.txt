A class of sufficient conditions of local regularity for suitable weak solutions to the nonstationary three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are discussed. The corresponding results are formulated in terms of functionals which are invariant with respect to the Navier-Stokes equations scaling. The famous Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg condition is contained in that class as a particular case.
