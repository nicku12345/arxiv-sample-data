Let \Omega be a bounded C^{2,\alpha} domain in \R^n (n\geq 1, 0<\alpha<1), \Omega^{\ast} be the open Euclidean ball centered at 0 having the same Lebesgue measure as \Omega, \tau\geq 0 and v\in L^{\infty}(\Omega,\R^n) with \left\Vert v\right\Vert\_{\infty}\leq \tau. If \lambda\_{1}(\Omega,\tau) denotes the principal eigenvalue of the operator -\Delta+v\cdot\nabla in \Omega with Dirichlet boundary condition, we establish that \lambda\_{1}(\Omega,v)\geq \lambda\_{1}(\Omega^{\ast},\tau e\_{r}) where e\_{r}(x)=x/| x|. Moreover, equality holds only when, up to translation, \Omega=\Omega^{\ast} and v=\tau e\_{r}. This result can be viewed as an isoperimetric inequality for the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian with drift. It generalizes the celebrated Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality for the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian.
