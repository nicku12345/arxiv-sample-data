The caustics of Fourier integral operators are defined as caustics of the corresponding Schwartz kernels (Lagrangian distributions on X\times Y). The caustic set \Sigma(C) of the canonical relation C is characterized as the set of points where the rank of the projection \pi:C\to X\times Y is smaller than its maximal value, dim(X\times Y)-1. We derive the L\sp p(Y)\to L\sp q(X) estimates on Fourier integral operators with caustics of corank 1 (such as caustics of type A\sb{m+1}, m\in\N). For the values of p and q outside of certain neighborhood of the line of duality, q=p', the L\sp p\to L\sp q estimates are proved to be caustics-insensitive.   We apply our results to the analysis of the blow-up of the estimates on the half-wave operator just before the geodesic flow forms caustics.
