We obtain optimal continuity in Sobolev spaces for the Fourier integral operators associated to singular canonical relations, when one of the two projections is a Whitney fold. The regularity depends on the type, k, of the other projection from the canonical relation (k=1 for a Whitney fold). We prove that one loses (4+\frac{2}{k})^{-1} of a derivative in the regularity properties.   The proof is based on the L^2 estimates for oscillatory integral operators.
