We prove a regularity result for the Poisson problem -\Delta u = f, u |\_{\pa \PP} = g on a polyhedral domain \PP \subset \RR^3 using the \BK\ spaces \Kond{m}{a}(\PP). These are weighted Sobolev spaces in which the weight is given by the distance to the set of edges \cite{Babu70, Kondratiev67}. In particular, we show that there is no loss of \Kond{m}{a}--regularity for solutions of strongly elliptic systems with smooth coefficients. We also establish a "trace theorem" for the restriction to the boundary of the functions in \Kond{m}{a}(\PP).
