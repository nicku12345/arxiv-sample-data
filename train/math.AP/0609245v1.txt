We consider the equation - \Delta u+V(x)u- k(\Del(|u|^{2}))u=g(x,u), u>0, x \in {\BR}^2, where V:{\BR}^2\to {\BR} and g:{\BR}^2 \times {\BR}\to {\BR} are two continuous 1-periodic functions. Also, we assume g behaves like \exp (\beta |u|^4) as |u|\to \infty. We prove the existence of at least one weak solution u \in H^1({\BR}^2) with u^2 \in H^1({\BR}^2). Mountain pass in a suitable Orlicz space together with Moser-Trudinger are employed to establish this result. Such equations arise when one seeks for standing wave solutions for the corresponding quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. Schr\"{o}dinger equations of this type have been studied as models of several physical phenomena. The nonlinearity here corresponds to the superfluid film equation in plasma physics.
