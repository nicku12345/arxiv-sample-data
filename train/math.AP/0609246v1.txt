Mountain pass in a suitable Orlicz space is employed to prove the existence of soliton solutions for a quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation involving critical exponent in {\BR}^N. These equations contain strongly singular nonlinearities which include derivatives of the second order. Such equations have been studied as models of several physical phenomena. The nonlinearity here corresponds to the superfluid film equation in plasma physics.
