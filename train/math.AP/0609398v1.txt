We study the permanent regimes of the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell system for laser-plasma interaction. A non-relativistic and two different relativistic models are investigated. We prove the existence of solutions where the distribution function is Boltzmannian and the electromagnetic variables are time-harmonic and circularly polarized.
