We study the extinction behavior of solutions to the fast diffusion equation u_t = \Delta u^m on \R^N\times (0,T), in the range of exponents m \in (0, \frac{N-2}{N}), N > 2. We show that if the initial data u_0 is trapped in between two Barenblatt solutions vanishing at time T, then the vanishing behaviour of u at T is given by a Barenblatt solution. We also give an example showing that for such a behavior the bound from above by a Barenblatt solution B (vanishing at T) is crucial: we construct a class of solutions u with initial data u_0 = B (1 + o(1)), near  |x| >> 1, which live longer than B and change behaviour at T. The behavior of such solutions is governed by B(\cdot,t) up to T, while for t >T the solutions become integrable and exhibit a different vanishing profile. For the Yamabe flow (m = \frac{N-2}{N+2}) the above means that these solutions u develop a singularity at time T, when the Barenblatt solution disappears, and at t >T they immediately smoothen up and exhibit the vanishing profile of a sphere.   In the appendix we show how to remove the assumption on the bound on u_0 from below by a Barenblatt.
