We establish global well-posedness and scattering for solutions to the defocusing mass-critical (pseudoconformal) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation iu_t + \Delta u = |u|^{4/n} u for large spherically symmetric L^2_x(\R^n) initial data in dimensions n\geq 3. After using the reductions in \cite{compact} to reduce to eliminating blowup solutions which are almost periodic modulo scaling, we obtain a frequency-localized Morawetz estimate and exclude a mass evacuation scenario (somewhat analogously to \cite{ckstt:gwp}, \cite{RV}, \cite{thesis:art}) in order to conclude the argument.
