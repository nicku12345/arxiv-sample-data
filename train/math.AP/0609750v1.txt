The large time behavior of non-negative solutions to the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation u_t - \Delta u + |\nabla u|^q = 0 in the whole space R^N is investigated for the critical exponent q = (N+2)/(N+1). Convergence towards a rescaled self-similar solution of the linear heat equation is shown, the rescaling factor being (\log(t))^{-(N+1)}. The proof relies on the construction of a one-dimensional invariant manifold for a suitable truncation of the equation written in self-similar variables.
