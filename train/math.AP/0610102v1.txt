We construct the precise boundary trace of positive solutions of \Delta u=u^q in a smooth bounded domain in R^N, for q in the super-critical range q\geq (N+1)/(N-1). The construction is performed in the framework of the fine topology associated with the Bessel capacity C_{2/q,q'} on the boundary of the domain. We prove that the boundary trace is a Borel measure (in general unbounded), which is outer regular relative to this capacity. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for such measures to be the boundary trace of a positive solution and prove that the corresponding generalized boundary value problem is well-posed in the class of \sigma-moderate solutions.
