We study the dispersive properties of the Schr\"odinger equation. Precisely, we look for estimates which give a control of the local regularity and decay at infinity {\it separately}. The Banach spaces that allow such a treatment are the Wiener amalgam spaces, and Strichartz-type estimates are proved in this framework. These estimates improve some of the classical ones in the case of large time.
