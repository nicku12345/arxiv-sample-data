If L is a selfdual Lagrangian L on a reflexive phase space X\times X^*, then the vector field x\to \bar\partial L(x):=\{p\in X^*; (p,x)\in \partial L(x,p)\} is maximal monotone. Conversely, any maximal monotone operator T on X is derived from such a potential on phase space, that is there exists a selfdual Lagrangian L on X\times X^* (i.e, L^*(p, x) =L(x, p)) such that T=\bar\partial L.   This solution to problems raised by Fitzpatrick can be seen as an extension of a celebrated result of Rockafellar stating that maximal cyclically monotone operators are actually of the form T=\partial \phi for some convex lower semi-continuous function on X. This representation allows for the application of the selfdual variational theory --recently developed by the author-- to the equations driven by maximal monotone vector fields. Consequently, solutions to equations of the form \Lambda x\in Tx for a given map \Lambda: D(\Lambda)\subset X\to X^*, can now be obtained by minimizing functionals of the form I(x)=L(x,\Lambda x)-< x, \Lambda x>.
