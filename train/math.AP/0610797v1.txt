A general class of singular abstract Cauchy problems is considered which naturally arises in applications to certain Free Boundary Problems. Existence of an associated evolution operator characterizing its solutions is established and is subsequently used to derive optimal regularity results. The latter are well known to be important basic tools needed to deal with corresponding nonlinear Cauchy Problems such as those associated to Free Boundary Problems.
