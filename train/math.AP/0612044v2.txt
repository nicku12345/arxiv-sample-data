Extending our previous results for artificial viscosity systems, we show, under suitable spectral hypotheses, that shock wave solutions of compressible Navier--Stokes (cNS) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations undergo Hopf bifurcation to nearby time-periodic solutions. The main new difficulty associated with physical viscosity and the corresponding absence of parabolic smoothing is the need to show that the difference between nonlinear and linearized solution operators is quadratically small in H^s for data in H^s. We accomplish this by a novel energy estimate carried out in Lagrangian coordinates; interestingly, this estimate is false in Eulerian coordinates. At the same time, we greatly sharpen and simplify the analysis of the previous work.
