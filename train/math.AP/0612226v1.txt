Let the space \mathbb{R}^n be endowed with a Minkowski structure M (that is M\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to [0,+\infty) is the gauge function of a compact convex set having the origin as an interior point, and with boundary of class C^2), and let d^M(x,y) be the (asymmetric) distance associated to M. Given an open domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n of class C^2, let d_{\Omega}(x) := \inf\{d^M(x,y); y\in\partial\Omega\} be the Minkowski distance of a point x\in\Omega from the boundary of \Omega. We prove that a suitable extension of d_{\Omega} to \mathbb{R}^n (which plays the r\"ole of a signed Minkowski distance to \partial \Omega) is of class C^2 in a tubular neighborhood of \partial \Omega, and that d_{\Omega} is of class C^2 outside the cut locus of \partial\Omega (that is the closure of the set of points of non--differentiability of d_{\Omega} in \Omega). In addition, we prove that the cut locus of \partial \Omega has Lebesgue measure zero, and that \Omega can be decomposed, up to this set of vanishing measure, into geodesics starting from \partial\Omega and going into \Omega along the normal direction (with respect to the Minkowski distance). We compute explicitly the Jacobian determinant of the change of variables that associates to every point x\in \Omega outside the cut locus the pair (p(x), d_{\Omega}(x)), where p(x) denotes the (unique) projection of x on \partial\Omega, and we apply these techniques to the analysis of PDEs of Monge-Kantorovich type arising from problems in optimal transportation theory and shape optimization.
