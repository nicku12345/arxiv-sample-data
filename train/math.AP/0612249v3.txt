By using the Strichartz esitmate and Picard iteration, we prove the subcritical(critical in some cases) global solution in C_t H_x^s\cap C_t^1 H^{s-1}_x with small data for semilinear wave equation with nonlinearity of type (\partial u)^k(k\ge 1+\frac{4}{n-1}\vee 2 and (n,k)\neq (3,3)). For (n,k)=(3,3), we get the almost global existence. In addition, we give the global existence with radial data when k> 1+\frac{2}{n-1}\vee 2.
