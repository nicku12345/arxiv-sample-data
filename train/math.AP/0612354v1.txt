In this paper we find estimates for the optimal constant in the critical Sobolev trace inequality S\|u\|^p_{L^{p_*}(\partial\Omega) \hookrightarrow \|u\|^p_{W^{1,p}(\Omega)} that are independent of \Omega. This estimates generalized those of [3] for general p. Here p_* := p(N-1)/(N-p) is the critical exponent for the immersion and N is the space dimension. Then we apply our results first to prove existence of positive solutions to a nonlinear elliptic problem with a nonlinear boundary condition with critical growth on the boundary, generalizing the results of [16]. Finally, we study an optimal design problem with critical exponent.
