We provide estimates for the H\"older exponent of solutions to the Beltrami equation \dbar f=\mu\de f+\nu\bar{\de f}, where the Beltrami coefficients \mu,\nu satisfy \||\mu|+|\nu|\|_\infty<1 and \Im(\nu)=0. Our estimates depend on the arguments of the Beltrami coefficients as well as on their moduli. Furthermore, we exhibit a class of mappings of the ``angular stretching" type, on which our estimates are actually attained, and we discuss the main properties of such mappings.
