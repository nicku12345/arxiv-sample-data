Solutions to the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the real line are studied in Sobolev spaces H^s, for s negative but close to 0. For smooth solutions there is an {\em a priori} upper bound for the H^s norm of the solution, in terms of the H^s norm of the datum, for arbitrarily large data, for sufficiently short time. Weak solutions are constructed for arbitrary initial data in H^s.
