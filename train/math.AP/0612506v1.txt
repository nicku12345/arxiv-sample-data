We show that the 1d viscous Burgers equation considered for complex valued functions develops finite-time singularities from compactly supported smooth data. By means of the Cole-Hopf transformation, the singularities of the solutions are related to zeros of complex-valued solutions of the heat equation. We prove that such zeros are isolated if they are not present in the initial data.
