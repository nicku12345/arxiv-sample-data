We establish two global subellipticity properties of positive symmetric second-order partial differential operators on L_2(\Ri^d). First, if m \in \Ni then we consider operators H_0 with coefficients in W^{m+1,\infty}(\Ri^d) and domain D(H_0)=W^{\infty,2}(\Ri^d) satisfying the subellipticity property \[ c (\phi, (I+H_0)\phi)\geq \|\Delta^{\gamma/2} \phi\|_2^2 \] for some c>0 and \gamma\in<0,1], uniformly for all \phi\in W^{\infty,2}(\Ri^d), where \Delta denotes the usual Laplacian. Then we prove that D(H^\alpha) \subseteq D(\Delta^{\alpha \gamma}) for all \alpha \in [0,2^{-1} (m + 1 + \gamma^{-1})>. Hence there is a c>0 such that the norm estimate \[ c \|(I+H)^\alpha \phi\|_2\geq \|\Delta^{\alpha \gamma} \phi\|_2 \] is valid for all \phi\in D(H^\alpha) where H denotes the self-adjoint closure of H_0. In particular, if the coefficients of H_0 are in C_b^\infty(\Ri^d) then the conclusion is valid for all \alpha\geq0.   Secondly, we prove that if \[ H_0=\sum^N_{i=1}X_i^* X_i, \] where the X_i are vector fields on \Ri^d with coefficients in C_b^\infty(\Ri^d) satisfying a uniform version of H\"ormander's criterion for hypoellipticity, then H_0 satisfies the subellipticity condition for \gamma=r^{-1} where r is the rank of the set of vector fields. Consequently D(H^n) \subseteq D(\Delta^{n/r}) for all n \in \Ni, where H is the closure of H_0.
