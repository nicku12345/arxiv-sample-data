An explicit series solution is proposed for the inversion of the spherical mean Radon transform. Such an inversion is required in problems of thermo- and photo- acoustic tomography. Closed-form inversion formulae are currently known only for the case when the centers of the integration spheres lie on a sphere surrounding the support of the unknown function, or on certain unbounded surfaces. Our approach results in an explicit series solution for any closed measuring surface surrounding a region for which the eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet Laplacian are explicitly known - such as, for example, cube, finite cylinder, half-sphere etc. In addition, we present a fast reconstruction algorithm applicable in the case when the detectors (the centers of the integration spheres) lie on a surface of a cube. This algorithm reconsrtucts 3-D images thousands times faster than backprojection-type methods.
