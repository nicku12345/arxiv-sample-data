Current theoretical results for the three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations only guarantee that solutions remain regular for all time when the initial enstrophy (\|Du_0\|^2:=\int|{\rm curl} u_0|^2) is sufficiently small,   \|Du_0\|^2\le\chi_0. In fact, this smallness condition is such that the enstrophy is always non-increasing. In this paper we provide a numerical procedure that will verify regularity of solutions for any bounded set of initial conditions,   \|Du_0\|^2\le\chi_1. Under the assumption that the equations are in fact regular we show that this procedure can be guaranteed to terminate after a finite time.
