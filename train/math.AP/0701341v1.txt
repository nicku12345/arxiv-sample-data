In their 2006 paper, Chernyshenko et al prove that a sufficiently smooth strong solution of the 3d Navier-Stokes equations is robust with respect to small enough changes in initial conditions and forcing function. They also show that if a regular enough strong solution exists then Galerkin approximations converge to it. They then use these results to conclude that the existence of a sufficiently regular strong solution can be verified using sufficiently refined numerical computations. In this paper we study the solutions with minimal required regularity to be strong, which are less regular than those considered in Chernyshenko et al (2006). We prove a similar robustness result and show the validity of the results relating convergent numerical computations and the existence of the strong solutions.
