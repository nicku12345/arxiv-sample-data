In this article we introduce the notion of fundamental solution in the Colombeau context as an element of the dual \LL(\Gc(\R^n),\wt{\C}). After having proved the existence of a fundamental solution for a large class of partial differential operators with constant Colombeau coefficients, we investigate the relationships between fundamental solutions in \LL(\Gc(\R^n),\wt{\C}), Colombeau solvability and \G- and \Ginf-hypoellipticity respectively.
