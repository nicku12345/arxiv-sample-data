We consider the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for {\em inelastic hard spheres}, in the framework of so-called {\em constant normal restitution coefficients} \alpha \in [0,1]. In the physical regime of a small inelasticity (that is \alpha \in [\alpha_*,1) for some constructive \alpha_*>0) we prove uniqueness of the self-similar profile for given values of the restitution coefficient \alpha \in [\alpha_*,1), the mass and the momentum; therefore we deduce the uniqueness of the self-similar solution (up to a time translation). Moreover, if the initial datum lies in L^1_3, and under some smallness condition on (1-\alpha_*) depending on the mass, energy and L^1_3 norm of this initial datum, we prove time asymptotic convergence (with polynomial rate) of the solution towards the self-similar solution (the so-called {\em homogeneous cooling state}). These uniqueness, stability and convergence results are expressed in the self-similar variables and then translate into corresponding results for the original Boltzmann equation. The proofs are based on the identification of a suitable elastic limit rescaling, and the construction of a smooth path of self-similar profiles connecting to a particular Maxwellian equilibrium in the elastic limit, together with tools from perturbative theory of linear operators. Some universal quantities, such as the "quasi-elastic self-similar temperature" and the rate of convergence towards self-similarity at first order in terms of (1-\alpha), are obtained from our study. These results provide a positive answer and a mathematical proof of the Ernst-Brito conjecture [16] in the case of inelastic hard spheres with small inelasticity.
