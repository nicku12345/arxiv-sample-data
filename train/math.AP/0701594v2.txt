We examine the regularity of weak solutions of quasi-geostrophic (QG) type equations with supercritical (\alpha <1/2) dissipation (-\Delta)^\alpha. This study is motivated by a recent work of Caffarelli and Vasseur, in which they study the global regularity issue for the critical (\alpha = 1/2) QG equation \cite{CV}. Their approach successively increases the regularity levels of Leray-Hopf weak solutions: from L^2 to L^\infty, from L^\infty to H\"{o}lder (C^{\delta}, \delta>0), and from H\"{o}lder to classical solutions. In the supercritical case, Leray-Hopf weak solutions can still be shown to be L^\infty, but it does not appear that their approach can be easily extended to establish the H\"{o}lder continuity of L^\infty solutions. In order for their approach to work, we require the velocity to be in the H\"{o}lder space C^{1-2\alpha}. Higher regularity starting from C^\delta with \delta>1-2\alpha can be established through Besov space techniques and will be presented elsewhere \cite{CW6}.
