In this paper we consider the nonlinear equation involving differential forms on a compact Riemannian manifold \delta d \xi = f'(<\xi,\xi>)\xi. This equation is a generalization of the semilinear Maxwell equations recently introduced in a paper by Benci and Fortunato. We obtain a multiplicity result both in the positive mass case (i.e. f'(t)\geq\epsilon>0 uniformly) and in the zero mass case (f'(t)\geq 0 and f'(0)=0) where a strong convexity hypothesis on the nonlinearity is assumed.
