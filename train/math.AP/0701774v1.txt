In this paper we study a simple non-local semilinear parabolic equation with Neumann boundary condition. We give local existence result and prove global existence for small initial data. A natural non increasing in time energy is associated to this equation. We prove that the solution blows up at finite time T if and only if its energy is negative at some time before T. The proof of this result is based on a Gamma-convergence technique.
