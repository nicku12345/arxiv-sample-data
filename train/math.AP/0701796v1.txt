Consider axisymmetric strong solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in \R^3 with non-trivial swirl. Such solutions are not known to be globally defined, but it is shown in \cite{MR673830} that they could only blow up on the axis of symmetry.   Let z denote the axis of symmetry and r measure the distance to the z-axis. Suppose the solution satisfies the pointwise scale invariant bound |v (x,t)| \le C_*{(r^2 -t)^{-1/2}}  for -T_0\le t < 0 and 0<C_*<\infty allowed to be large, we then prove that v is regular at time zero.
