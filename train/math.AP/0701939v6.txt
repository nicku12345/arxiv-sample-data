Sharp error estimates in terms of the fractional Laplacian and a weighted Besov norm are obtained for Pitt's inequality by using the spectral representation with weights for the fractional Laplacian due to Frank, Lieb and Seiringer and the sharp Stein-Weiss inequality. Dilation invariance, group symmetry on a non-unimodular group and a nonlinear Stein-Weiss lemma are used to provide short proofs of the Frank-Seiringer "Hardy inequalities" where fractional smoothness is measured by a Besov norm.
