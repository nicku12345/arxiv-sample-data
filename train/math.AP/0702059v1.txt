We study the homogenization of a linear kinetic equation which models the evolution of the density of charged particles submitted to a highly oscillating electric field. The electric field and the initial density are assumed to be random and stationary. We identify the asymptotic microscopic and macroscopic profiles of the density, and we derive formulas for these profiles when the space dimension is equal to one.
