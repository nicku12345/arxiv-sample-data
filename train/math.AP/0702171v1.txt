Let x_0\in\Omega\subset\Bbb{R}^n, n\ge 2, be a domain and let m\ge 2. We will prove that a solution u of the polyharmonic equation \Delta^mu=0 in \Omega\setminus\{x_0\} has a removable singularity at x_0 if and only if |\Delta^ku(x)|=o(|x-x_0|^{2-n})\quad\forall k=0,1,2,...,m-1 as |x-x_0|\to 0 for n\ge 3 and =o(\log (|x-x_0|^{-1}))\quad\forall k=0,1,2,...,m-1 as |x-x_0|\to 0 for n=2. For m\ge 2 we will also prove that u has a removable singularity at x_0 if |u(x)|=o(|x-x_0|^{2m-n}) as |x-x_0|\to 0 for n\ge 3 and |u(x)| =o(|x-x_0|^{2m-2}\log (|x-x_0|^{-1})) as |x-x_0|\to 0 for n=2.
