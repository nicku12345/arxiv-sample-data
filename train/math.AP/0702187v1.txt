In this paper we consider the nonexistence of global solutions of a Klein-Gordon equation of the form \begin{eqnarray*} u_{tt}-\Delta u+m^2u=f(u)& (t,x)\in [0,T)\times\R^n. \end{eqnarray*} Here m\neq 0 and the nonlinear power f(u) satisfies some assumptions which will be stated later. We give a sufficient condition on the initial datum with arbitrarily high initial energy such that the solution of the above Klein-Gordon equation blows up in a finite time.
