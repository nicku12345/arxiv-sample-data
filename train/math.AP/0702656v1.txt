Solutions of semi-classical Schrodinger equation with isotropic harmonic potential focus periodically in time. We study the perturbation of this equation by a nonlinear term. If the scaling of this perturbation is critical, each focus crossing is described by a nonlinear scattering operator, which is therefore iterated as many times as the solution passes through a focus. The study of this nonlinear problem is made possible by the introduction of two operators well adapted to Schrodinger equations with harmonic potential, and by suitable Strichartz inequalities.
