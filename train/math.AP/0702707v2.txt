We prove global well-posedness for low regularity data for the one dimensional quintic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Precisely we show that a unique and global solution exists for initial data in the Sobolev space H^{s}(\mathbb R) for any s>{1/3}. This improves the result in \cite{tz}, where global well-posedness was established for any s>{4/9}. We use the I-method to take advantage of the conservation laws of the equation. The new ingredient in our proof is an interaction Morawetz estimate for the smoothed out solution Iu. As a byproduct of our proof we also obtain that the H^{s} norm of the solution obeys polynomial-in-time bounds.
