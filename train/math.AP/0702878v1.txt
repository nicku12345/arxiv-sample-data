We consider the equation \e^{2}\Delta u=(u-a(x))(u^2-1) in \Omega, \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} =0 on \partial \Omega, where \Omega is a smooth and bounded domain in \R^n, \nu the outer unit normal to \pa\Omega, and a a smooth function satisfying -1<a(x)<1 in \ov{\Omega}. We set K, \Omega_+ and \Omega_- to be respectively the zero-level set of a, {a>0} and {a<0}. Assuming \nabla a \neq 0 on K and a\ne 0 on \partial \Omega, we show that there exists a sequence \e_j \to 0 such that the above equation has a solution u_{\e_j} which converges uniformly to \pm 1 on the compact sets of \O_{\pm} as j \to + \infty.
