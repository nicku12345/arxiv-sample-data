We consider the vorticity formulation of the 2-D viscous Camassa-Holm equations in the whole space. We establish global existence for solutions corresponding to initial data in L^1 and describe the large time behavior of solutions with sufficiently small and localized initial data. We calculate the rate at which such solutions approach an ``un-filtered'' Oseen vortex by computing the rate at which the solution of a scaled vorticity problem approaches the solution to a corresponding linearized equation.
