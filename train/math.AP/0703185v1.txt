Dirac-Schr\"{o}dinger systems play a central role when modeling Dirac bundles and Dirac-Schr\"{o}dinger operators near the boundary, along ends or near other singularities of Riemannian manifolds. In this article we develop the Fredholm theory of Dirac-Schr\"{o}dinger systems with Lipschitz coefficients.
