The 1D Cauchy problem for the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system is shown to be locally well-posed for low regularity Dirac data in \hat{H^{s,p}} and wave data in \hat{H^{r,p}} \times \hat{H^{r-1,p}} for 1<p\le 2 under certain assumptions on the parameters r and s, where \|f\|_{\hat{H^{s,p}}} := \| < \xi >^s \hat{f}\|_{L^{p'}}, generalizing the results for p=2 by Selberg and Tesfahun. Especially we are able to improve the results from the scaling point of view with respect to the Dirac part.
