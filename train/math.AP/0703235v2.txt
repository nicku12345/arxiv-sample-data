We consider the problem of identifying sharp criteria under which radial H^1 (finite energy) solutions to the focusing 3d cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) i\partial_t u + \Delta u + |u|^2u=0 scatter, i.e. approach the solution to a linear Schr\"odinger equation as t\to \pm \infty. The criteria is expressed in terms of the scale-invariant quantities \|u_0\|_{L^2}\|\nabla u_0\|_{L^2} and M[u]E[u], where u_0 denotes the initial data, and M[u] and E[u] denote the (conserved in time) mass and energy of the corresponding solution u(t). The focusing NLS possesses a soliton solution e^{it}Q(x), where Q is the ground-state solution to a nonlinear elliptic equation, and we prove that if M[u]E[u]<M[Q]E[Q] and \|u_0\|_{L^2}\|\nabla u_0\|_{L^2} < \|Q\|_{L^2}\|\nabla Q\|_{L^2}, then the solution u(t) is globally well-posed and scatters. This condition is sharp in the sense that the soliton solution e^{it}Q(x), for which equality in these conditions is obtained, is global but does not scatter. We further show that if M[u]E[u]<M[Q]E[Q] and \|u_0\|_{L^2}\|\nabla u_0\|_{L^2} > \|Q\|_{L^2}\|\nabla Q\|_{L^2}, then the solution blows-up in finite time. The technique employed is parallel to that employed by Kenig-Merle \cite{KM06a} in their study of the energy-critical NLS.
