For a certain class of genuinely nonlinear two-by-two planar hyperbolic systems we show that any classical solution on a smoothly bounded domain has nontangential boundary limits except on a set whose Hausdorff dimension is bounded by some system-dependent constant which is strictly less than 1 and, on the other hand, that for any system of the kind considered there is in fact a solution on a half-plane which fails to have nontangential limits at a set of boundary points of positive Hausdorff dimension.
