This article is devoted to characterize all possible effective behaviors of composite materials by means of periodic homogenization. This is known as a G-closure problem. Under convexity and p-growth conditions (p>1), it is proved that all such possible effective energy densities obtained by a \Gamma-convergence analysis, can be locally recovered by the pointwise limit of a sequence of periodic homogenized energy densities with prescribed volume fractions. A weaker locality result is also provided without any kind of convexity assumption and the zero level set of effective energy densities is characterized in terms of Young measures. A similar result is given for cell integrands which enables to propose new counter-examples to the validity of the cell formula in the nonconvex case and to the continuity of the determinant with respect to the two-scale convergence.
