In this paper we present an approximation result concerning the first eigenvalue of the 1-Laplacian operator. More precisely, for \Omega a bounded regular open domain, we consider a minimisation of the functional {\ds \int_\Omega}|\nabla u|+n({\ds \int_\Omega} |u|-1)^2  over the space W_0^{1,1}(\Omega). For n large enough, the infimum is achieved in some sense on BV(\Omega), and letting n go to infinity this provides an approximation of the first eigenfunction for the first eigenvalue, since the term n({\ds \int_\Omega} |u|^2-1)^2 "tends" to the constraint \|u\|_1=1.
