In this paper, the existence and asymptotic behavior of C^1 solutions to the multidimensional compressible Euler equations with damping on the framework of Besov space are considered. We weaken the regularity requirement of the initial data, and improve the well-posedness results of Sideris-Thomases-Wang (Comm.P.D.E. 28 (2003) 953). The global existence lies on a crucial a-priori estimate which is proved by the spectral localization method. The main analytic tools are the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and Bony's para-product formula.
