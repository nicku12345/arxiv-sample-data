We establish the local well-posedness of the generalized Benjamin-Ono equation \partial_tu+\mathcal{H}\partial_x^2u\pm u^k\partial_xu=0 in H^s(\R), s>1/2-1/k for k\geq 12 and without smallness assumption on the initial data. The condition s>1/2-1/k is known to be sharp since the solution map u_0\mapsto u is not of class \mathcal{C}^{k+1} on H^s(\R) for s<1/2-1/k. On the other hand, in the particular case of the cubic Benjamin-Ono equation, we prove the ill-posedness in H^s(\R), s<1/3.
