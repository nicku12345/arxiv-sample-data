We consider some nonlinear elliptic equations on {\mathbb R}^n and {\mathbb S}^n. By the method of moving spheres, we obtain the symmetry properties of solutions and some nonexistence results. Moreover, by the global bifurcation theory, we obtain a multiplicity result for a class of semilinear elliptic equations.
