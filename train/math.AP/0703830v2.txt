We are concerned on the possibility of finite time singularity in a partially viscous magnetohydrodynamic equations in \Bbb R^n, n=2,3, namely the MHD with positive viscosity and zero resistivity. In the special case of zero magnetic field the system reduces to the Navier-Stokes equations in \Bbb R^n.   In this paper we exclude the scenario of finite time singularity in the form of self-similarity, under suitable integrability conditions on the velocity and the magnetic field. We also prove the nonexistence of asymptotically self-similar singularity. This provides us information on the behavior of solutions near possible singularity of general type as described in Corollary 1.1 below.
