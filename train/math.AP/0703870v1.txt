We construct a family of singular solutions to some nonlinear partial differential equations which have resonances in the sense of a paper due to T. Kobayashi. The leading term of a solution in our family contains a logarithm, possibly multiplied by a monomial. As an application, we study nonlinear wave equations with quadratic nonlinearities. The proof is by the reduction to a Fuchsian equation with singular coefficients.
