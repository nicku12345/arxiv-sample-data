The large time behavior of zero mass solutions to the Cauchy problem for a convection-diffusion equation. We provide conditions on the size and shape of the initial datum such that the large time asymptotics of solutions is given either by the derivative of the Guass-Weierstrass kernel or by a self-similar solution or by a hyperbolic N-wave
