We establish existence and pointwise estimates of fundamental solutions and Green's matrices for divergence form, second order strongly elliptic systems in a domain \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 3, under the assumption that solutions of the system satisfy De Giorgi-Nash type local H\"{o}lder continuity estimates. In particular, our results apply to perturbations of diagonal systems, and thus especially to complex perturbations of a single real equation.
