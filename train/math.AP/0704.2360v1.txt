The object of the present paper is to show the existence and the uniqueness of a reproductive strong solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. the solution \boldsymbol{u}  belongs to \text{}\mathbf{L}% ^{\infty}(0,T;V) \cap \mathbf{L}^{2}(0,T;\mathbf{H}% ^{2}(\Omega)) and satisfies the property \boldsymbol{u}% (\boldsymbol{x,}T) =\boldsymbol{u}% (\boldsymbol{x,}0) =\boldsymbol{u}_{0}(\boldsymbol{x}). One considers the case of an incompressible fluid in two dimensions with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, and external forces are neglected.
