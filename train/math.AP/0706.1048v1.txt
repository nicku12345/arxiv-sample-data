In this paper we find estimates for the optimal constant in the critical Sobolev trace inequality \lambda_1(\Omega)\|u\|_{L^1(\partial\Omega)} \le \|u\|_{W^{1,1}(\Omega)} that are independent of \Omega. This estimates generalize those of \cite{BS} concerning the p-Laplacian to the case p=1.   We apply our results to prove existence of an extremal for this embedding. We then study an optimal design problem related to \lambda_1, and eventually compute the shape derivative of the functional \Omega\to\lambda_1(\Omega). As a consequence, we obtain that a ball of \R^n of radius n is critical for volume-preserving deformations.
