We consider the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation   \partial_t u + \partial_x (\partial_x^2 u + f(u))=0, \quad (t,x)\in [0,T)\times \mathbb{R}, (1)   with general C^3 nonlinearity f. Under an explicit condition on f and c>0, there exists a solution in the energy space H^1 of (1) of the type u(t,x)=Q_c(x-x_0-ct), called soliton.   In this paper, under general assumptions on f and Q_c, we prove that the family of soliton solutions around Q_c is asymptotically stable in some local sense in H^1, i.e. if u(t) is close to Q_{c} (for all t\geq 0), then u(t) locally converges in the energy space to some Q_{c_+} as t\to +\infty. Note in particular that we do not assume the stability of Q_{c}. This result is based on a rigidity property of equation (1) around Q_{c} in the energy space whose proof relies on the introduction of a dual problem. These results extend the main results in previous works devoted to the pure power case.
