We are interested in the cost-convex potentials in optimal mass transport theory, and we show by direct and geometric arguments the equivalence between cost-subdifferentials and ordinary subdifferentials of cost-convex functions, under the assumptions A0, A1, A2, and A3W on cost functions introduced by Ma, Trudinger, and Wang. The connectivity of contact sets of optimal transport maps follows as a direct corollary. Our approach is quite different from the previous result of Loeper which he obtained as the first step toward his Hoelder regularity theory of potential functions, and which was based upon approximation using the regularity theory of Ma, Trudinger, and Wang. The result in this paper improves his result, by relaxing certain geometrical assumptions on the domains and targets; it also completes his Hoelder regularity theory of potential functions on the round sphere, by making it self-contained.
