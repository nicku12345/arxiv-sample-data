The aim of this article is to present an elementary proof of a global existence result for nonlinear wave equations satifying the null condition in an exterior domain. The novelty of our proof is to avoid completely the scaling operator which would make the argument complicated in the mixed problem, by using a new weighted pointwise estimates of a tangential derivative to the light cone.
