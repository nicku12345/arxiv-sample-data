In this paper we study the magneto-micropolar fluid equations in \R^3, prove the existence of the strong solution with initial data in H^s(\R^3) for s> {3/2}, and set up its blow-up criterion. The tool we mainly use is Littlewood-Paley decomposition, by which we obtain a Beale-Kato-Majda type blow-up criterion for smooth solution (u,\omega,b) which relies on the vorticity of velocity \nabla\times u only.
