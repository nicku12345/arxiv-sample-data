This paper shows how abstract resolvent estimates imply local smoothing for solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation. If the resolvent estimate has a loss when compared to the optimal, non-trapping estimate, there is a corresponding loss in regularity in the local smoothing estimate. As an application, we apply well-known techniques to obtain well-posedness results for the semi-linear Schr\"odinger equation.
