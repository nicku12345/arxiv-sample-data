In this paper we establish the nonlinear stability of solitary traveling-wave solutions for the Kawahara-KdV equation u_t+uu_x+u_{xxx}-\gamma_1 u_{xxxxx}=0, and the modified Kawahara-KdV equation u_t+3u^2u_x+u_{xxx}-\gamma_2 u_{xxxxx}=0, where \gamma_i\in\mathbb{R} is a positive number when i=1,2. The main approach used to determine the stability of solitary traveling-waves will be the theory developed by Albert
