In this paper, we study a linear system related to the 2d system of Euler equations with thermal conduction in the quasi-isobaric approximation of Kull-Anisimov [14]. This model is used for the study of the ablation front instability, which appears in the problem of inertial confinement fusion. This physical system contains a mixing region, in which the density of the gaz varies quickly, and one denotes by L0 an associated characteristic length. The system of equations is linearized around a stationary solution, and each perturbed quantity is written using the normal modes method. The resulting linear system is not self-adjoint, of order 5, with coefficients depending on x and on physical parameters \alpha, \beta. We calculate Evans function associated with this linear system, using rigorous constructions of decreasing at \pm \infty solutions of systems of ODE. We prove that for \alpha small, there is no bounded solution of the linearized system.
