We prove the uniqueness of solutions of the Maxwell-Schr"odinger system with given asymptotic behaviour at infinity in time. The assumptions include suitable restrictions on the growth of solutions for large time and on the accuracy of their asymptotics, but no restriction on their size. The result applies to the solutions with prescribed asymptotics constructed in a previous paper.
