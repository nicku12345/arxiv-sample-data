We study the local existence of strong solutions for the cubic nonlinear wave equation with data in H^s(M), s<1/2, where M is a three dimensional compact riemannian manifold. This problem is supercritical and can be shown to be strongly ill-posed (in the Hadamard sense). However, after a suitable randomization, we are able to construct local strong solution for a large set of initial data in H^s(M), where s\geq 1/4 in the case of a boundary less manifold and s\geq 8/21 in the case of a manifold with boundary.
