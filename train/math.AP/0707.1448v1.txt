We prove that the subquartic wave equation on the three dimensional ball \Theta, with Dirichlet boundary conditions admits global strong solutions for a large set of random supercritical initial data in \cap_{s<1/2} H^s(\Theta). We obtain this result as a consequence of a general random data Cauchy theory for supercritical wave equations developed in our previous work \cite{BT2} and invariant measure considerations which allow us to obtain also precise large time dynamical informations on our solutions.
