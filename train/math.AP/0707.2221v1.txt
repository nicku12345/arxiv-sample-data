We prove that for a large class of vorticity functions the crest of a corresponding travelling water wave is necessarily a point of maximal horizontal velocity. We also show that for waves with nonpositive vorticity the pressure in the flow is everywhere larger than the atmospheric pressure. A related a priori estimate for waves with nonnegative vorticity is also given.
