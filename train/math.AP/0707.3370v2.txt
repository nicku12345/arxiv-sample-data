We prove global weighted Strichartz estimates for radial solutions of linear Schr\"odinger equation on a class of rotationally symmetric noncompact manifolds, generalizing the known results on hyperbolic and Damek-Ricci spaces. This yields classical Strichartz estimates with a larger class of exponents than in the Euclidian case and improvements for the scattering theory. The manifolds, whose volume element grows polynomially or exponentially at infinity, are characterized essentially by negativity conditions on the curvature, which shows in particular that the rich algebraic structure of the Hyperbolic and Damek-Ricci spaces is not the cause of the improved dispersive properties of the equation. The proofs are based on known dispersive results for the equation with potential on the Euclidean space, and on a new one, valid for C^1 potentials decaying like 1/r^2 at infinity.
