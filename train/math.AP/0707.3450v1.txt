We study the positive, regular, radially symmetric solutions to the nonlinear biharmonic equation \Delta^2 \phi = \phi^p. First, we show that there exists a critical value p_c, depending on the space dimension, such that the solutions are linearly unstable if p<p_c and linearly stable if p\geq p_c. Then, we focus on the supercritical case p\geq p_c and we show that the graphs of no two solutions intersect one another.
