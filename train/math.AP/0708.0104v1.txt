We prove existence of a special class of solutions to the (elliptic) Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation - \epsilon^2 \Delta \psi + V(x) \psi = |\psi|^{p-1} \psi on a manifold or in the Euclidean space. Here V represents the potential, p is an exponent greater than 1 and \epsilon a small parameter corresponding to the Planck constant. As \epsilon tends to zero (namely in the semiclassical limit) we prove existence of complex-valued solutions which concentrate along closed curves, and whose phase in highly oscillatory. Physically, these solutions carry quantum-mechanical momentum along the limit curves. In the first part of this work we identified the limit set and constructed approximate solutions, while here we give the complete proof of our main existence result.
