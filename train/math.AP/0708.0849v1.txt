We establish global well-posedness and scattering for solutions to the mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation iu_t + \Delta u = \pm |u|^{4/d} u for large spherically symmetric L^2_x(R^d) initial data in dimensions d\geq 3. In the focusing case we require that the mass is strictly less than that of the ground state. As a consequence, we obtain that in the focusing case, any spherically symmetric blowup solution must concentrate at least the mass of the ground state at the blowup time.
