In this paper we study the smoothness properties of solutions to the KP-I equation. We show that the equation's dispersive nature leads to a gain in regularity for the solution. In particular, if the initial data \phi possesses certain regularity and sufficient decay as x \to \infty, then the solution u(t) will be smoother than \phi for 0 < t \leq T where T is the existence time of the solution.
