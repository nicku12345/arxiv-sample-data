We show that if a Leray-Hopf solution u to the 3D Navier-Stokes equation belongs to C((0,T]; B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}) or its jumps in the B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}-norm do not exceed a constant multiple of viscosity, then u is regular on (0,T]. Our method uses frequency local estimates on the nonlinear term, and yields an extension of the classical Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin criterion.
