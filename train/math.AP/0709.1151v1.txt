We completely solve the equivalence problem for Euler-Bernoulli equation using Lie symmetry analysis. We show that the quotient of the symmetry Lie algebra of the Bernoulli equation by the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by solution symmetries is a representation of one of the following Lie algebras: 2A_1, A_1\oplus A_2, 3A_1, or A_{3,3}\oplus A_1. Each quotient symmetry Lie algebra determines an equivalence class of Euler-Bernoulli equations. Save for the generic case corresponding to arbitrary lineal mass density and flexural rigidity, we characterize the elements of each class by giving a determined set of differential equations satisfied by physical parameters (lineal mass density and flexural rigidity). For each class, we provide a simple representative and we explicitly construct transformations that maps a class member to its representative. The maximally symmetric class described by the four-dimensional quotient symmetry Lie algebra A_{3,3}\oplus A_1 corresponds to Euler-Bernoulli equations homeomorphic to the uniform one (constant lineal mass density and flexural rigidity) . We rigorously derive some non-trivial and non-uniform Euler-Bernoulli equations reducible to the uniform unit beam. Our models extend and emphasize the symmetry flavor of Gottlieb's iso-spectral beams (Proceedings of the Royal Society London A 413 (1987) 235-250)
