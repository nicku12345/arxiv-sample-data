We study the large-time behaviour of the solutions u of the evolution equation involving nonlinear diffusion and gradient absorption \partial_t u - \Delta_p u + |\nabla u|^q=0. We consider the problem posed for x\in {\mathbb R}^N  and t>0 with non-negative and compactly supported initial data. We take the exponent p>2 which corresponds to slow p-Laplacian diffusion, and the exponent q in the superlinear range 1<q<p-1. In this range the influence of the Hamilton-Jacobi term  |\nabla u|^q is determinant, and gives rise to the phenomenon of localization. The large time behaviour is described in terms of a suitable self-similar solution that solves a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The shape of the corresponding spatial pattern is rather conical instead of bell-shaped or parabolic.
