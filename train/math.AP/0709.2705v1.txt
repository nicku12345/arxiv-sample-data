For a given semilinear parabolic equation with polynomial nonlinearity, many solutions blow up in finite time. For a certain large class of these equations, we show that some of the solutions which do not blow up actually tend to equilibria. The characterizing property of such solutions is a finite energy constraint, which comes about from the fact that this class of equations can be written as the L^2 gradient of a certain functional.
