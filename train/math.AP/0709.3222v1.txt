We describe the asymptotic behavior as time goes to infinity of solutions of the 2 dimensional corotational wave map system and of solutions to the 4 dimensional, radially symmetric Yang-Mills equation, in the critical energy space, with data of energy smaller than or equal to a harmonic map of minimal energy. An alternative holds: either the data is the harmonic map and the soltuion is constant in time, or the solution scatters in infinite time.
