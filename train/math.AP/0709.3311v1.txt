Let f be a function on a bounded domain \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n and \delta be a positive function on \Omega such that B(x,\delta(x))\subseteq \Omega. Let \sigma(f)(x) be the average of f over the ball B(x,\delta(x)). The restricted mean-value theorems discuss the conditions on f,\delta, and \Omega under which \sigma(f)=f implies that f is harmonic. In this paper, we study the stability of harmonic functions with respect to the map \sigma. One expects that, in general, the sequence \sigma^n(f) converges to a harmonic function. Among our results, we show that if \Omega is strongly convex (respectively C^{2,\alpha}-smooth for some \alpha\in [0,1]), the function \delta(x) is continuous, and f\in C^0(\bar \Omega) (respectively, f\in C^{2,\alpha}(\bar \Omega)), then \sigma^n(f) converges to a harmonic function uniformly on \bar \Omega.
