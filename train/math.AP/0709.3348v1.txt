In this paper we find a closed form of the solution for the factored inhomogeneous linear equation \begin{equation*} \prod_{j=1}^{n}(\frac{\hbox{d}}{\hbox{d}t}-A_{j}) u(t) =f(t). \end{equation*} Under the hypothesis A_{1},A_{2}, ..., A_{n} are infinitesimal generators of mutually commuting strongly continuous semigroups of bounded linear operators on a Banach space X. Here we do not assume that A_{j}s are distinct and we offer the computational method to get explicit solutions of certain partial differential equations.
