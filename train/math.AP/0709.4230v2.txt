Consider axisymmetric strong solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in \R^3 with non-trivial swirl. Let z denote the axis of symmetry and r measure the distance to the z-axis. Suppose the solution satisfies either |v (x,t)| \le C_*{|t|^{-1/2}}  or, for some \e > 0, |v (x,t)| \le C_* r^{-1+\epsilon} |t|^{-\epsilon /2} for -T_0\le t < 0 and 0<C_*<\infty allowed to be large. We prove that v is regular at time zero.
