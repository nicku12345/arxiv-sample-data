We present an alpha-regularization of the Birkhoff-Rott equation, induced by the two-dimensional Euler-alpha equations, for the vortex sheet dynamics. We show that initially smooth self-avoiding vortex sheet remains smooth for all times under the alpha-regularized dynamics, provided the initial density of vorticity is an integrable function over the curve with respect to the arc-length measure.
