We show the obstacle version of the Strauss conjecture holds when the spatial dimension is equal to 4. We also show that an almost global existence theorem of H\"ormander for (4+1)-dimensional Minkowski space holds in the obstacle setting. We use weighed space-time variants of the energy inequality and a variant of the classical Hardy inequality.
