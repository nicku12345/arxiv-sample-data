We present a variational principle governing the quasistatic evolution of a linearized elastoplastic material. In case of linear hardening, the novel characterization allows to recover and partly extend some known results and proves itself to be especially well-suited for discussing general approximation and convergence issues. In particular, the variational principle is exploited in order to prove in a novel setting the convergence of time and space-time discretizations as well as to provide some possible a posteriori error control.
