In the work we consider the magnetic NLS equation   (\frac{\hbar}{i} \nabla -A(x))^2 u + V(x)u - f(|u|^2)u = 0 \quad {in} \R^N where N \geq 3, A \colon \R^N \to \R^N is a magnetic potential, possibly unbounded, V \colon \R^N \to \R is a multi-well electric potential, which can vanish somewhere, f is a subcritical nonlinear term. We prove the existence of a semiclassical multi-peak solution u\colon \R^N \to \C, under conditions on the nonlinearity which are nearly optimal.
