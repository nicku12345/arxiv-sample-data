Scattering of radial H^1 solutions to the 3D focusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation below a mass-energy threshold M[u]E[u] < M[Q]E[Q] and satisfying an initial mass-gradient bound \|u_0\|_{L^2} \|\nabla u_0 \|_{L^2} < \|Q\|_{L^2} \|\nabla Q\|_{L^2}, where Q is the ground state, was established in Holmer-Roudenko (2007). In this note, we extend the result in Holmer-Roudenko (2007) to non-radial H^1 data. For this, we prove a non-radial profile decomposition involving a spatial translation parameter. Then, in the spirit of Kenig-Merle (2006), we control via momentum conservation the rate of divergence of the spatial translation parameter and by a convexity argument based on a local virial identity deduce scattering. An application to the defocusing case is also mentioned.
