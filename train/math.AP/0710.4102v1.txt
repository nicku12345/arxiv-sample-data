We study solutions of the decoupled Maxwell equations in the exterior region of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stationary regions, where the Schwarzschild coordinate r ranges over 2M < r_1 < r < r_2, we obtain a decay rate of t^{-1} for all components of the Maxwell field. We use vector field methods and do not require a spherical harmonic decomposition.   In outgoing regions, where the Regge-Wheeler tortoise coordinate is large, r_*>\epsilon t, we obtain decay for the null components with rates of |\phi_+| \sim |\alpha| < C r^{-5/2}, |\phi_0| \sim |\rho| + |\sigma| < C r^{-2} |t-r_*|^{-1/2}, and |\phi_{-1}| \sim |\underline{\alpha}| < C r^{-1} |t-r_*|^{-1}. Along the event horizon and in ingoing regions, where r_*<0, and when t+r_*1, all components (normalized with respect to an ingoing null basis) decay at a rate of C \uout^{-1} with \uout=t+r_* in the exterior region.
