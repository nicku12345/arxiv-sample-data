In this paper, we investigate the characteristic structure of the full equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and show that it satisfies the hypotheses of a general variable-multiplicity stability frame- work introduced by Metivier and Zumbrun, thereby extending to the general case various results obtained by Metivier and Zumbrun for the isentropic equations of MHD.
