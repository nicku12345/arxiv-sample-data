We give a simple proof of the uniqueness of fluid particle trajectories corresponding to: 1) the solution of the two-dimensional Navier Stokes equations with an initial condition that is only square integrable, and 2) the local strong solution of the three-dimensional equations with an H^{1/2}-regular initial condition i.e.\ with the minimal Sobolev regularity known to guarantee uniqueness. This result was proved by Chemin & Lerner (J Diff Eq 121 (1995) 314-328) using the Littlewood-Paley theory for the flow in the whole space \R^d, d\ge 2. We first show that the solutions of the differential equation \dot{X}=u(X,t) are unique if u\in L^p(0,T;H^{(d/2)-1}) for some p>1 and \sqrt{t}\,u\in L^2(0,T;H^{(d/2)+1}). We then prove, using standard energy methods, that the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with initial condition in H^{(d/2)-1} satisfies these conditions. This proof is also valid for the more physically relevant case of bounded domains.
