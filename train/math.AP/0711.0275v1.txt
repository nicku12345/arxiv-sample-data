We prove that the defocusing quintic wave equation, with Neumann boundary conditions, is globally wellposed on H^1_N(\Omega) \times L^2(\Omega) for any smooth (compact) domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3. The proof relies on one hand on L^p estimates for the spectral projector by Smith and Sogge, and on the other hand on a precise analysis of the boundary value problem, which turns out to be much more delicate than in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions.
