We consider the initial value problem of the fifth order modified KdV equation on the Sobolev spaces. \partial_t u - \partial_x^5u + c_1\partial_x^3(u^3) + c_2u\partial_x u\partial_x^2 u + c_3uu\partial_x^3 u =0, u(x,0)= u_0(x) where  u:R\timesR \to R  and c_j's are real. We show the local well-posedness in H^s(R) for s \geq 3/4 via the contraction principle on X^{s,b} space. Also, we show that the solution map from data to the solutions fails to be uniformly continuous below H^{3/4}(R). The counter example is obtained by approximating the fifth order mKdV equation by the cubic NLS equation.
