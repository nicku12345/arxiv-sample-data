Let L = -1/4 (\sum_{j=1}^n(X_j^2+Y_j^2)+i\gamma T) where \gamma is a complex number, X_j, Y_j, and T are the left invariant vector fields of the Heisenberg group structure for R^n \times R^n \times R. We explicitly compute the Fourier transform (in the spatial variables) of the fundamental solution of the Heat Equation \partial_s\rho = -L\rho. As a consequence, we have a simplified computation of the Fourier transform of the fundamental solution of the \Box_b-heat equation on the Heisenberg group and an explicit kernel of the heat equation associated to the weighted dbar-operator in C^n with weight \exp(-\tau P(z_1,...,z_n)) where P(z_1,...,z_n) = 1/2(x_1^2 + >... x_n^2), z_j=x_j+iy_j, and \tau\in R.
