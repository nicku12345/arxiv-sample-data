We consider the steady-state Navier-Stokes equation in the whole space \mathbb{R}^3 driven by a forcing function f. The class of source functions f under consideration yield the existence of at least one solution with finite Dirichlet integral (\|\nabla U\|_2<\infty). Under the additional assumptions that f is absent of low modes and the ratio of f to viscosity is sufficiently small in a natural norm we construct solutions which have finite energy (finite L^2 norm). These solutions are unique among all solutions with finite energy and finite Dirichlet integral. The constructed solutions are also shown to be stable in the following sense: If U is such a solution then any viscous, incompressible flow in the whole space, driven by f and starting with finite energy, will return to U.
