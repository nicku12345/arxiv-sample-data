We consider nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in dimension 3 or higher. We prove that symmetric finite energy solutions close to orbitally stable ground states converge asymptotically to a sum of a ground state and a dispersive wave assuming the so called Fermi Golden Rule (FGR) hypothesis. We improve the sign condition required in a recent paper by Gang Zhou and I.M.Sigal
