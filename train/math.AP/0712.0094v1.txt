We consider solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws regularized with vanishing diffusion and dispersion terms. Following a pioneering work by Schonbek, we establish the convergence of the regularized solutions toward discontinuous solutions of the hyperbolic conservation law. The proof relies on the method of compensated compactness in the L^2 setting. Our result improves upon Schonbek's earlier results and provides an optimal condition on the balance between the relative sizes of the diffusion and the dispersion parameters. A convergence result is also established for multi-dimensional conservation laws by relying on DiPerna's uniqueness theorem for entropy measure-valued solutions.
