We consider a space-homogeneous gas of {\it inelastic hard spheres}, with a {\it diffusive term} representing a random background forcing (in the framework of so-called {\em constant normal restitution coefficients} \alpha \in [0,1] for the inelasticity). In the physical regime of a small inelasticity (that is \alpha \in [\alpha_*,1) for some constructive \alpha_* \in [0,1)) we prove uniqueness of the stationary solution for given values of the restitution coefficient \alpha \in [\alpha_*,1), the mass and the momentum, and we give various results on the linear stability and nonlinear stability of this stationary solution.
