In this paper we deal with existence and uniqueness of solution to super-linear problems for the Pucci operator:  -\M^+(D^2u)+|u|^{s-1}u=f(x) \quad {in} \RR^n,  where s>1 and f satisfies only local integrability conditions. This result is well known when, instead of the Pucci operator, the Laplacian or a divergence form operator is considered. Our existence results use the Alexandroff-Bakelman-Pucci inequality since we cannot use any variational formulation. For radially symmetric f we can prove our results under less local integrability assumptions, taking advantage of an appropriate variational formulation. We also obtain an existence result with boundary explosion in smooth domains.
