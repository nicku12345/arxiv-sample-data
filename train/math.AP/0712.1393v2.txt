The space-time monopole equation on \R^{2+1} can be derived by a dimensional reduction of the anti-self-dual Yang Mills equations on \R^{2+2}. It can be also viewed as the hyperbolic analog of Bogomolny equations. We uncover null forms in the nonlinearities and employ optimal bilinear estimates in the framework of Wave-Sobolev spaces. As a result, we show the equation is locally wellposed in the Coulomb gauge for initial data sufficiently small in H^s for s>{1/4}.
