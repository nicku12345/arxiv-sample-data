We consider semi-stable, radially symmetric, and decreasing solutions of a reaction equation involving the p-Laplacian, where the reaction term is a locally Lipschitz function, and the domain is the unit ball. For this class of radial solutions, which includes local minimizers, we establish pointwise and Sobolev estimates which are optimal and do not depend on the specific nonlinear reaction term. Under standard assumptions we also prove the regularity of the corresponding extremal solution.
