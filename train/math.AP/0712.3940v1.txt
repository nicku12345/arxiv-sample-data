We derive various approximations for the solutions of nonlinear hyperbolic systems with fastly oscillating initial data. We first provide error estimates for the so-called slowly varying envelope, full dispersion, and Schr\"odinger approximations in a Wiener algebra; this functional framework allows us to give precise conditions on the validity of these models; we give in particular a rigorous proof of the ``practical rule'' which serves as a criterion for the use of the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA). We also discuss the extension of these models to short pulses and more generally to large spectrum waves, such as chirped pulses. We then derive and justify rigorously a modified Schr\"odinger equation with improved frequency dispersion. Numerical computations are then presented, which confirm the theoretical predictions.
