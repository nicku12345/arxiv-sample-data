We consider a non relativistic charged particle in a 1-dimensional infinite square potential well. This quantum system is subjected to a control, which is a uniform (in space) time depending electric field. It is represented by a complex probability amplitude solution of a Schrodinger equation on a 1-dimensional bounded domain, with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove the almost global approximate stabilization of the eigenstates by explicit feedback laws.
