he equation -\Delta u = \lambda e^u posed in the unit ball B \subseteq \R^N, with homogeneous Dirichlet condition u|_{\partial B} = 0, has the singular solution U=\log\frac1{|x|^2} when \lambda = 2(N-2). If N\ge 4 we show that under small deformations of the ball there is a singular solution (u,\lambda) close to (U,2(N-2)). In dimension N\ge 11 it corresponds to the extremal solution -- the one associated to the largest \lambda for which existence holds. In contrast, we prove that if the deformation is sufficiently large then even when N\ge 10, the extremal solution remains bounded in many cases.
