It is proved that a general polyhedral perfect conducting obstacle in \mathbb{R}^3, possibly consisting of finitely many solid polyhedra, is uniquely determined by the far-field pattern corresponding to a single incident wave. This improves earlier results in the literature to the formally determined case.
