We establish elements of a new approch to ellipticity and parametrices within operator algebras on a manifold with higher singularities, only based on some general axiomatic requirements on parameter-dependent operators in suitable scales of spaces. The idea is to model an iterative process with new generations of parameter-dependent operator theories, together with new scales of spaces that satisfy analogous requirements as the original ones, now on a corresponding higher level.   The "full" calculus is voluminous; so we content ourselves here with some typical aspects such as symbols in terms of order reducing families, classes of relevant examples, and operators near a corner point.
