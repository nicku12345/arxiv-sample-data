We prove global well-posedness and scattering in H^1 for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} &(i\partial_t+\Delta_\g)u=u|u|^{2\sigma}; &u(0)=\phi, \end{cases} \end{equation*} on the hyperbolic spaces \H^d, d\geq 2, for exponents \sigma\in(0,2/(d-2)). The main unexpected conclusion is scattering to linear solutions in the case of small exponents \sigma; for comparison, on Euclidean spaces scattering in H^1 is not known for any exponent \sigma\in(1/d,2/d] and is known to fail for \sigma\in(0,1/d]. Our main ingredients are certain noneuclidean global in time Strichartz estimates and noneuclidean Morawetz inequalities.
