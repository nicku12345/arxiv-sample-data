We study the existence and instability properties of saddle-shaped solutions of the semilinear elliptic equation -\Delta u = f(u) in the whole \R^{2m}, where f is of bistable type. It is known that in dimension 2m=2 there exists a saddle-shaped solution. This is a solution which changes sign in \R^2 and vanishes only on \{|x_1|=|x_2|\}. It is also known that this solution is unstable.   In this article we prove the existence of saddle-shaped solutions in every even dimension, as well as their instability in the case of dimension 2m=4. More precisely, our main result establishes that if 2m=4, every solution vanishing on the Simons cone \{(x^1,x^2)\in\R^m\times\R^m : |x^1|=|x^2|\} is unstable outside of every compact set and, as a consequence, has infinite Morse index. These results are relevant in connection with a conjecture of De Giorgi extensively studied in recent years and for which the existence of a counter-example in high dimensions is still an open problem.
