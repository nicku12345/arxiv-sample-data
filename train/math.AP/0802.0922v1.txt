Let \Gamma be a graph endowed with a reversible Markov kernel p, and P the associated operator, defined by Pf(x)=\sum_y p(x,y)f(y). Denote by \nabla the discrete gradient. We give necessary and/or sufficient conditions on \Gamma in order to compare \Vert \nabla f \Vert_{p} and \Vert (I-P)^{1/2}f \Vert_{p} uniformly in f for 1<p<+\infty. These conditions are different for p<2 and p>2. The proofs rely on recent techniques developed to handle operators beyond the class of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators. For our purpose, we also prove Littlewood-Paley inequalities and interpolation results for Sobolev spaces in this context, which are of independent interest.
