We derive a quantitative rigidity estimate for a multiwell problem in nonlinear elasticity. Precisely, we show that if a gradient field is L^1-close to a set of the form SO(n)U_1 \cup ... \cup SO(n)U_l, and an appropriate bound on the length of the interfaces holds, then the gradient field is actually close to only one of the wells SO(n)U_i. The estimate holds for any connected subdomain, and has the optimal scaling.
