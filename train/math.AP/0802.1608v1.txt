We prove the logarithmic convexity of certain quantities, which measure the quadratic exponential decay at infinity and within two characteristic hyperplanes of solutions of Schr\"odinger evolutions. As a consequence we obtain some uniqueness results that generalize (a weak form of) Hardy's version of the uncertainty principle. We also obtain corresponding results for heat evolutions.
