In this paper we address the question of the singular vortex dynamics exhibited in [15], which generates a corner in finite time. The purpose is to prove that under some appropriate small regular perturbation the corner still remains. Our approach uses the Hasimoto transform and deals with the long range scattering properties of a Gross-Pitaevski equation with time-variable coefficients.
