In this paper we establish the local Lyapunov property of certain L^p and Besov norms of the vorticity fields. We have resolved in part, a certain open problem posed by Tosio Kato for the three dimensional Navier Stokes equation by studying the vorticity equation. The local dissipativity of the sum of linear and non-linear operators of the vorticity equation is established. One of the main techniques used here is Littlewood-Paley analysis.
