We are interested here in describing the linear response of the ocean to some wind forcing, which admits fast time oscillations and may be resonant with the Coriolis force. In addition to the usual Ekman layer, we exhibit another - much larger - boundary layer, and some global vertical profile. That means in particular that the wind effect is no longer localized in the vicinity of the surface. From a mathematical point of view, the main novelty here is to introduce some systematic approach for the study of boundary effects.
