Wiegerinck has shown that a separately subharmonic function need not be subharmonic. Improving previous results of Lelong, of Avanissian, of Arsove and of us, Armitage and Gardiner gave an almost sharp integrability condition which ensures a separately subharmonic function to be subharmonic. Completing now our recent counterparts to the cited results of Lelong, Avanissian and Arsove for so called quasi-nearly subharmonic functions, we present a counterpart to the cited result of Armitage and Gardiner for separately quasi-nearly subharmonic functions. This counterpart enables us to slightly improve Armitage's and Gardiner's original result, too. The method we use is a rather straightforward and technical, but still by no means easy, modification of Armitage's and Gardiner's argument combined with an old argument of Domar.
