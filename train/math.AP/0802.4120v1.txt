We present abstract inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates for dispersive operators, extending previous work by M. Keel and T. Tao on the one hand, and generalising results of D. Foschi, M. Vilela, M. Nakamura and T. Ozawa on the other hand. It is shown that these abstract estimates imply new inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates for the wave equation and some Schr\"odinger equations involving potentials.
