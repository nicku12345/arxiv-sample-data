The aim of this paper is to propose methods that enable us to build new numerical schemes, which preserve the Lie symmetries of the original differential equations. To this purpose, the compound Burgers-Korteweg-de Vries (\textit{CBKDV}) equation is considered. The particular case of the Burgers equation is taken as a numerical example, and the resulting semi-invariant scheme is exposed.
