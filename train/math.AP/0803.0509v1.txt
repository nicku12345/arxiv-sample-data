We consider a class of non-trivial perturbations {\mathscr A} of the degenerate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator in {\mathbb R}^N. In fact we perturb both the diffusion and the drift part of the operator (say Q and B) allowing the diffusion part to be unbounded in {\mathbb R}^N. Assuming that the kernel of the matrix Q(x) is invariant with respect to x\in {\mathbb R}^N and the Kalman rank condition is satisfied at any x\in{\mathbb R}^N by the same m<N, and developing a revised version of Bernstein's method we prove that we can associate a semigroup \{T(t)\} of bounded operators (in the space of bounded and continuous functions) with the operator {\mathscr A}. Moreover, we provide several uniform estimates for the spatial derivatives of the semigroup \{T(t)\} both in isotropic and anisotropic spaces of (H\"older-) continuous functions. Finally, we prove Schauder estimates for some elliptic and parabolic problems associated with the operator {\mathscr A}.
