Following the work of Duistermaat-Singer \cite{DS} on isomorphisms of algebras of global pseudodifferential operators, we classify isomorphisms of algebras of microlocally defined semiclassical pseudodifferential operators. Specifically, we show that any such isomorphism is given by conjugation by A = BF, where B is a microlocally elliptic semiclassical pseudodifferential operator, and F is a microlocal h-FIO associated to the graph of a local symplectic transformation.
