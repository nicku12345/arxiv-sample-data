We show that for a quantum completely integrable system in two dimensions,the L^{2}-normalized joint eigenfunctions of the commuting semiclassical pseudodifferential operators satisfy restriction bounds ofthe form  \int_{\gamma} |\phi_{j}^{\hbar}|^2 ds = {\mathcal O}(|\log \hbar|) for generic curves \gamma on the surface. We also prove that the maximal restriction bounds of Burq-Gerard-Tzvetkov are always attained for certain exceptional subsequences of eigenfunctions.
