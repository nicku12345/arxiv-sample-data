In this paper, we consider the modified quasi-geostrophic equation \begin{gather*} \del_t \theta + (u \cdot \grad) \theta + \kappa \Lambda^\alpha \theta = 0 u = \Lambda^{\alpha - 1} R^{\perp}\theta. \end{gather*} with \kappa > 0, \alpha \in (0,1] and \theta_0 \in \lp{2}(\R^2). We remark that the extra \Lambda^{\alpha - 1} is introduced in order to make the scaling invariance of this system similar to the scaling invariance of the critical quasi-geostrophic equations. In this paper, we use Besov space techniques to prove global existence and regularity of strong solutions to this system.
