Considering the Cauchy problem for the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation \begin{eqnarray*} u_t+u_{xxx}+\epsilon |\partial_x|^{2\alpha}u+(u^2)_x=0, \ u(0)=\phi, \end{eqnarray*} where 0<\epsilon,\alpha\leq 1 and u is a real-valued function, we show that it is globally well-posed in H^s\ (s>s_\alpha), and uniformly globally well-posed in H^s (s>-3/4) for all \epsilon \in (0,1). Moreover, we prove that for any T>0, its solution converges in C([0,T]; H^s) to that of the KdV equation if \epsilon tends to 0.
