In this paper we study the maximum principle, the existence of eigenvalue and the existence of solution for the Dirichlet problem for operators which are fully-nonlinear, elliptic but presenting some singularity or degeneracy which are similar to those of the p-Laplacian, the novelty resides in the fact that we consider the equations in bounded domains which only satisfy the exterior cone condition.
