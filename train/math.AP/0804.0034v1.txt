We prove Strichartz estimates for the absolutely continuous evolution of a Schr\"odinger operator H = (i\nabla + A)^2 + V in \R^n, n > 2. Both the magnetic and electric potentials are time-independent and satisfy pointwise polynomial decay bounds. The vector potential A(x) is assumed to be continuous but need not possess any Sobolev regularity. This work is a refinement of previous methods, which required extra conditions on {\rm div} A or |\nabla|^{\frac12}A in order to place the first order part of the perturbation within a suitable class of pseudo-differential operators.
