Let d\geq 4 and let u be a global solution to the focusing mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation iu_t+\Delta u=-|u|^{\frac 4d}u with spherically symmetric H_x^1 initial data and mass equal to that of the ground state Q. We prove that if u does not scatter then, up to phase rotation and scaling, u is the solitary wave e^{it}Q. Combining this result with that of Merle \cite{merle2}, we obtain that in dimensions d\geq 4, the only spherically symmetric minimal-mass blowup solutions are, up to phase rotation and scaling, the pseudo-conformal ground state and the solitary wave.
