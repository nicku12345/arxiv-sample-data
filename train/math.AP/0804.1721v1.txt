We apply robust control technics to an adaptive optics system including a dynamic model of the deformable mirror. The dynamic model of the mirror is a modification of the usual plate equation. We propose also a state-space approach to model the turbulent phase. A continuous time control of our model is suggested taking into account the frequential behavior of the turbulent phase. An H_\infty controller is designed in an infinite dimensional setting. Due to the multivariable nature of the control problem involved in adaptive optics systems, a significant improvement is obtained with respect to traditional single input single output methods.
