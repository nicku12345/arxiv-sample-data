We consider a nonlinear plate equation with thermal memory effects due to non-Fourier heat flux laws. First we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions as well as the existence of a global attractor. Then we use a suitable Lojasiewicz--Simon type inequality to show the convergence of global solutions to single steady states as time goes to infinity under the assumption that the nonlinear term f is real analytic. Moreover, we provide an estimate on the convergence rate.
