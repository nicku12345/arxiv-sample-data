A new sufficient condition is proved for the existence of stochastic semigroups generated by the sum of two unbounded operators. It is applied to one-dimensional piecewise deterministic Markov processes, where we also discuss the existence of a unique stationary density and give sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability.
