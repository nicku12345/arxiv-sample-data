We consider various types of Hardy-Sobolev inequalities on a Carnot-Carath\'eodory space (\Om, d) associated to a system of smooth vector fields X=\{X_1, X_2,...,X_m\} on \RR^n satisfying the H\"ormander's finite rank condition rank Lie[X_1,...,X_m] \equiv n. One of our main concerns is the trace inequality   \int_{\Om}|\phi(x)|^{p}V(x)dx\leq C\int_{\Om}|X\phi|^{p}dx,\qquad \phi\in C^{\infty}_{0}(\Om),   where V is a general weight, i.e., a nonnegative locally integrable function on \Om, and 1<p<+\infty. Under sharp geometric assumptions on the domain \Om\subset \Rn that can be measured equivalently in terms of subelliptic capacities or Hausdorff contents, we establish various forms of Hardy-Sobolev type inequalities.
