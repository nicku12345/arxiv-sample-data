In this paper we present integral conductor inequalities connecting the Lorentz p,q-(quasi)norm of a gradient of a function to a one-dimensional integral of the p,q-capacitance of the conductor between two level surfaces of the same function. These inequalities generalize an inequality obtained by the second author in the case of the Sobolev norm. Such conductor inequalities lead to necessary and sufficient conditions for Sobolev-Lorentz type inequalities involving two arbitrary measures.
