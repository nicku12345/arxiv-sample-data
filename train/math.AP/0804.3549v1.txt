The paper is a comprehensive study of the existence, uniqueness, blow up and regularity properties of solutions of the Burgers equation with fractional dissipation. We prove existence of the finite time blow up for the power of Laplacian \alpha < 1/2, and global existence as well as analyticity of solution for \alpha \geq 1/2. We also prove the existence of solutions with very rough initial data u_0 \in L^p, 1 < p < \infty. Many of the results can be extended to a more general class of equations, including the surface quasi-geostrophic equation.
