We consider the following nonlinear problem in \R^N \label{eq} - \Delta u +V(|y|)u=u^{p},\quad u>0 {in} \R^N, u \in H^1(\R^N)  where V(r) is a positive function, 1<p <\frac{N+2}{N-2}. We show that if V(r) has the following expansion: There are constants a>0, m>1, \theta>0, and V_0>0, such that \[ V(r)= V_0+\frac a {r^m} +O\bigl(\frac1{r^{m+\theta}}\bigr),\quad \text{as r\to +\infty,} \] then \eqref{eq} has {\bf infinitely many non-radial positive} solutions, whose energy can be made arbitrarily large.
