We obtain optimal generalized versions of Hardy inequalities, which as special cases contain Hardy's inequality and Hardy's inequality involving the distance function to the boundary of  \Omega. In addition we obtain neccesary and sufficient conditions to add improvements in the form of non negative potentials.
