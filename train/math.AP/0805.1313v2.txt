Consider the equation   u_t=\Delta u-Vu +au^p \text{in} R^n\times (0,T);   u(x,0)=\phi(x)\gneq0, \text{in} R^n,   where p>1, n\ge2, T\in(0,\infty], V(x)\sim\frac\omega{|x|^2} as |x|\to\infty, for some \omega\neq0, and a(x) is on the order |x|^m as |x|\to\infty, for some m\in (-\infty,\infty). A solution to the above equation is called global if T=\infty. Under some additional technical conditions, we calculate a critical exponent p^* such that global solutions exist for p>p^*, while for 1<p\le p^*, all solutions blow up in finite time. We also show that when V\equiv0, the blow-up/global solution dichotomy for \eqref{abstract} coincides with that for the corresponding problem in an exterior domain with the Dirichlet boundary condition, including the case in which p is equal to the critical exponent.
