We study the asymptotic behavior of large data solutions in the energy space H := H^1(\R^d) in very high dimension d \geq 11 to defocusing Schr\"odinger equations i u_t + \Delta u = |u|^{p-1} u + Vu in \R^d, where V \in C^\infty_0(\R^d) is a real potential (which could contain bound states), and 1+\frac{4}{d} < p < 1+\frac{4}{d-2} is an exponent which is energy-subcritical and mass-supercritical. In the spherically symmetric case, we show that as t \to +\infty, these solutions split into a radiation term that evolves according to the linear Schr\"odinger equation, and a remainder which converges in H to a compact attractor K, which consists of the union of spherically symmetric almost periodic orbits of the NLS flow in H. The main novelty of this result is that K is a \emph{global} attractor, being independent of the initial energy of the initial data; in particular, no matter how large the initial data is, all but a bounded amount of energy is radiated away in the limit.
