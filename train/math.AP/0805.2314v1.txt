We study the long time behaviour of solutions of semi-linear parabolic equation of the following type \partial_t u-\Delta u+a_0(x)u^q=0 where a_0(x) \geq d_0 \exp(\frac{\omega(|x|)}{|x|^2}), d_0>0, 1>q>0 and \omega a positive continuous radial function. We give a Dini-like condition on the function \omega by two different method which implies that any solution of the above equation vanishes in a finite time. The first one is a variant of a local energy method and the second one is derived from semi-classical limits of some Schr\"odinger operators.
