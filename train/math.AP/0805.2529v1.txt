We study the existence of a maximal solution of -\Gd u+g(u)=f(x) in a domain \Gw\subset \BBR^N with compact boundary, assuming that f\in (L^1_{loc}(\Gw))_+ and that g is nondecreasing, g(0)\geq 0 and g satisfies the Keller-Osserman condition. We show that if the boundary satisfies the classical C_{1,2} Wiener criterion then the maximal solution is a large solution, i.e., it blows up everywhere on the boundary. In addition we discuss the question of uniqueness of large solutions.
