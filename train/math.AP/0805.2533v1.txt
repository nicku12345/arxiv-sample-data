If h is a nondecreasing real valued function and 0\leq q\leq 2, we analyse the boundary behaviour of the gradient of any solution u of -\Delta u+h(u)+\abs {\nabla u}^q=f in a smooth N-dimensional domain \Omega with the condition that u tends to infinity when x tends to \partial\Omega. We give precise expressions of the blow-up which, in particular, point out the fact that the phenomenon occurs essentially in the normal direction to \partial\Omega. Motivated by the blow--up argument in our proof, we also give in Appendix a symmetry result for some related problems in the half space.
