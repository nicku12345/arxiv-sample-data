In this note we prove that appropriately scaled threshold dynamics-type algorithms corresponding to the fractional Laplacian of order \alpha \in (0,2) converge to moving fronts. When \alpha \geqq 1 the resulting interface moves by weighted mean curvature, while for \alpha <1 the normal velocity is nonlocal of ``fractional-type.'' The results easily extend to general nonlocal anisotropic threshold dynamics schemes.
