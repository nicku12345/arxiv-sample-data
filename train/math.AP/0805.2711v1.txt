In this paper, we study the following semilinear Schr\"odinger equation with periodic coefficient: -\triangle u +V(x)u=f(x,u), u\in H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{N}). The functional corresponding to this equation possesses strongly indefinite structure. The nonlinear term f(x,t) satisfies some superlinear growth conditions and need not be odd or increasing strictly in t. Using a new variational reduction method and a generalized Morse theory, we proved that this equation has infinitely many geometrically different solutions. Furthermore, if the solutions of this equation under some energy level are isolated, then we can show that this equation has infinitely many m-bump solutions for any positive integer m\geq 2.
