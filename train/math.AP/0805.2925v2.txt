In the 2-d setting, given an H^1 solution v(t) to the linear Schr\"odinger equation i\partial_t v +\Delta v =0, we prove the existence (but not uniqueness) of an H^1 solution u(t) to the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation i\partial_t u + \Delta u -|u|^{p-1}u=0 for nonlinear powers 2<p<3 and the existence of an H^1 solution u(t) to the defocusing Hartree equation i\partial_t u + \Delta u -(|x|^{-\gamma}\star|u|^{2})u=0 for interaction powers 1<\gamma<2, such that \|u(t)-v(t)\|_{H^1} \to 0 as t\to +\infty. This is a partial result toward the existence of well-defined continuous wave operators H^1 \to H^1 for these equations. For NLS in 2-d, such wave operators are known to exist for p\geq 3, while for p\leq 2 it is known that they cannot exist. The Hartree equation in 2-d only makes sense for 0<\gamma<2, and it was previously known that wave operators cannot exist for 0<\gamma\leq 1, while no result was previously known in the range 1<\gamma<2. Our proof in the case of NLS applies a new estimate of Colliander-Grillakis-Tzirakis (2008) to a strategy devised by Nakanishi (2001). For the Hartree equation, we prove a new correlation estimate following the method of Colliander-Grillakis-Tzirakis (2008).
