The long-time asymptotics is analyzed for finite energy solutions of the 1D discrete Schr\"odinger equation coupled to a nonlinear oscillator. The coupled system is invariant with respect to the phase rotation group. For initial states close to a solitary wave, the solution converges to a sum of another solitary wave and dispersive wave which is a solution to the free Schr\"odinger equation. The proofs use the strategy of Buslaev-Perelman: the linerization of the dynamics on the solitary manifold, the symplectic orthogonal projection, method of majorants, etc.
