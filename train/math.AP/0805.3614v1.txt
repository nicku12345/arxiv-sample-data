We study the asymptotic time behavior of global smooth solutions to general entropy dissipative hyperbolic systems of balance law in m space dimensions, under the Shizuta-Kawashima condition. We show that these solutions approach constant equilibrium state in the Lp-norm at a rate O(t^(-m/2(1-1/p))), as t tends to \infty, for p in [min (m,2),+ \infty]. Moreover, we can show that we can approximate, with a faster order of convergence, theconservative part of the solution in terms of the linearized hyperbolic operator for m >= 2, and by a parabolic equation in the spirit of Chapman-Enskog expansion. The main tool is given by a detailed analysis of the Green function for the linearized problem.
