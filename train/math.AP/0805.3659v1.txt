We study the limit, when k\to\infty, of the solutions u=u_{k} of (E) \prt_{t}u-\Delta u+ h(t)u^q=0 in \BBR^N\ti (0,\infty), u_{k}(.,0)=k\delta_{0}, with q>1, h(t)>0. If h(t)=e^{-\gw(t)/t} where \gw>0 satisfies to \int_{0}^1\sqrt{\gw(t)}t^{-1}dt<\infty, the limit function u_{\infty} is a solution of (E) with a single singularity at (0,0), while if \gw(t)\equiv 1, u_{\infty} is the maximal solution of (E). We examine similar questions for equations such as \prt_{t}u-\Gd u^m+ h(t)u^q=0 with m>1 and \prt_{t}u-\Gd u+ h(t)e^{u}=0.
