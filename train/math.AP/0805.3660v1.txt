We give a global bilateral estimate on the maximal solution \bar u_F of  \prt_tu-\Delta u+u^q=0 in \BBR^N\times (0,\infty), q>1, N\geq 1, which vanishes at t=0  on the complement of a closed subset F\subset \BBR^N. This estimate is expressed by a Wiener test involving the Bessel capacity C_{2/q,q'}. We deduce from this estimate that \bar {u}_F is \sigma-moderate in Dynkin's sense.
