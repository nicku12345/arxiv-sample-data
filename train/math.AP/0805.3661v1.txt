We study the boundary behaviour of solutions u of -\Delta_{N}u+ |u|^{q-1}u=0 in a bounded smooth domain \Omega\subset\mathbb R^{N} subject to the boundary condition u=0 except at one point, in the range q>N-1. We prove that if q\geq 2N-1 such a u is identically zero, while, if N-1<q<2N-1, u inherits a boundary behaviour which either corresponds to a weak singularity, or to a strong singularity. Such singularities are effectively constructed.
