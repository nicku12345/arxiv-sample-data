We prove bilateral capacitary estimates for the maximal solution U_F of -\Delta u+u^q=0 in the complement of an arbitrary closed set F\subset\mathbb R^N, involving the Bessel capacity C_{2,q'}, for q in the supercritical range q\geq q_{c}:=N/(N-2). We derive a pointwise necessary and sufficient condition, via a Wiener type criterion, in order that U_F(x)\to\infty as x\to y for given y\in\prt F. Finally we prove a general uniqueness result for large solutions.
