Let h:[0,\infty)\mapsto [0,\infty) be continuous and nondecreasing, h(t)>0 if t>0, and m,q be positive real numbers. We investigate the behavior when k\to\infty of the fundamental solutions u=u_{k} of \prt_{t} u-\Delta u^m+h(t)u^q=0 in \Omega\ti (0,T) satisfying u_{k}(x,0)=k\delta_0. The main question is wether the limit is still a solution of the above equation with an isolated singularity at (0,0), or a solution of the associated ordinary differential equation  u'+h(t)u^q=0 which blows-up at t=0.
