In this note, we extend the results on eigenfunction concentration in billiards as proved by the third author in \cite{M1}. There, the methods developed in Burq-Zworski \cite{BZ3} to study eigenfunctions for billiards which have rectangular components were applied. Here we take an arbitrary polygonal billiard B and show that eigenfunction mass cannot concentrate away from the vertices; in other words, given any neighbourhood U of the vertices, there is a lower bound  \int_U |u|^2 \geq c \int_B |u|^2  for some c = c(U) > 0 and any eigenfunction u.
