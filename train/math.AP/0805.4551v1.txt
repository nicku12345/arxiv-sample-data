In this paper, we present a bootstrap procedure for general elliptic systems with n(\geq 3) components. Combining with the L^p-L^q-estimates, it yields the optimal L^\infty-regularity conditions for the three well-known types of weak solutions: H_0^1-solutions, L^1-solutions and L^1_\delta-solutions. Thanks to the linear theory in L^p_\delta(\Omega), it also yields the optimal conditions for a priori estimates for L^1_\delta-solutions. Based on the a priori estimates, we improve known existence theorems for some classes of elliptic systems.
