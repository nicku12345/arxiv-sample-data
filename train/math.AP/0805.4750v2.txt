We consider the asymptotic behaviour of positive solutions u(t,x) of the fast diffusion equation u_t=\Delta (u^{m}/m)={\rm div} (u^{m-1}\nabla u) posed for x\in\RR^d, t>0, with a precise value for the exponent m=(d-4)/(d-2). The space dimension is d\ge 3 so that m<1, and even m=-1 for d=3. This case had been left open in the general study \cite{BBDGV} since it requires quite different functional analytic methods, due in particular to the absence of a spectral gap for the operator generating the linearized evolution.   The linearization of this flow is interpreted here as the heat flow of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of a suitable Riemannian Manifold (\RR^d,{\bf g}), with a metric {\bf g} which is conformal to the standard \RR^d metric. Studying the pointwise heat kernel behaviour allows to prove {suitable Gagliardo-Nirenberg} inequalities associated to the generator. Such inequalities in turn allow to study the nonlinear evolution as well, and to determine its asymptotics, which is identical to the one satisfied by the linearization. In terms of the rescaled representation, which is a nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation, the convergence rate turns out to be polynomial in time. This result is in contrast with the known exponential decay of such representation for all other values of m.
