We investigate qualitative properties of local solutions u(t,x)\ge 0 to the fast diffusion equation, \partial_t u =\Delta (u^m)/m with m<1, corresponding to general nonnegative initial data. Our main results are quantitative positivity and boundedness estimates for locally defined solutions in domains of the form [0,T]\times\RR^d. They combine into forms of new Harnack inequalities that are typical of fast diffusion equations. Such results are new for low m in the so-called very fast diffusion range, precisely for all m\le m_c=(d-2)/d. The boundedness statements are true even for m\le 0, while the positivity ones cannot be true in that range.
