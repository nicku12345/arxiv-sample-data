We prove that the Cauchy problem for the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is ill posed in \dot{B}^{-1,\infty}_{\infty} in the sense that a ``norm inflation'' happens in finite time. More precisely, we show that initial data in the Schwartz class \mathcal{S} that are arbitrarily small in \dot{B}^{-1, \infty}_{\infty} can produce solutions arbitrarily large in \dot{B}^{-1, \infty}_{\infty} after an arbitrarily short time. Such a result implies that the solution map itself is discontinuous in \dot{B}^{-1, \infty}_{\infty} at the origin.
