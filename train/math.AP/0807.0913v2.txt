Using the Mountain--Pass Theorem of Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz we prove that -\Delta_p u-\mu|x|^{-p}{u^{p-1}}=|x|^{-s}{u^{\crits-1}}+u^{\crit-1} admits a positive weak solution in \rn of class \dunp\cap C^1(\rn\setminus\{0\}), whenever \mu<\mu_1, and \mu_1=[(n-p)/p]^p. The technique is based on the existence of extremals of some Hardy--Sobolev type embeddings of independent interest. We also show that if u\in\dunp is a weak solution in \rn of -\Delta_p u-\mu|x|^{-p}{|u|^{p-2}u}=|x|^{-s}{|u|^{\crits-2}u}+|u|^{q-2}u, then u\equiv0 when either 1<q<\crit, or q>\crit and u is also of class L^\infty_\text{\scriptsize{loc}}(\rn\setminus\{0\}).
