For smooth bounded open sets in euclidean space, we construct corresponding contractive linear extension operators for the space of continuous functions which preserve regularity of functions in the domain of the Robin Laplacian. We also prove a Trotter-like approximation for the semigroup generated by the Laplacian subject to Robin boundary conditions in terms of these extension operators. The limiting case of Dirichlet boundary conditions is treated separately.
