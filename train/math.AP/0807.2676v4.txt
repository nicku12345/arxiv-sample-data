We consider the focusing mass-critical NLS iu_t + \Delta u = - |u|^{4/d} u in high dimensions d \geq 4, with initial data u(0) = u_0 having finite mass M(u_0) = \int_{\R^d} |u_0(x)|^2 dx < \infty. It is well known that this problem admits unique (but not global) strong solutions in the Strichartz class C^0_{t,\loc} L^2_x \cap L^2_{t,\loc} L^{2d/(d-2)}_x, and also admits global (but not unique) weak solutions in L^\infty_t L^2_x. In this paper we introduce an intermediate class of solution, which we call a \emph{semi-Strichartz class solution}, for which one does have global existence and uniqueness in dimensions d \geq 4. In dimensions d \geq 5 and assuming spherical symmetry, we also show the equivalence of the Strichartz class and the strong solution class (and also of the semi-Strichartz class and the semi-strong solution class), thus establishing ``unconditional'' uniqueness results in the strong and semi-strong classes. With these assumptions we also characterise these solutions in terms of the continuity properties of the mass function t \mapsto M(u(t)).
