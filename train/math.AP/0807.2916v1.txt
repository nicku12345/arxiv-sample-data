We consider the energy-critical semilinear focusing wave equation in dimension N=3,4,5. An explicit solution W of this equation is known. By the work of C. Kenig and F. Merle, any solution of initial condition (u_0,u_1) such that E(u_0,u_1)<E(W,0) and \|\nabla u_0\|_{L^2}<\|\nabla W\|_{L^2} is defined globally and has finite L^{\frac{2(N+1)}{N-2}}_{t,x}-norm, which implies that it scatters. In this note, we show that the supremum of the L^{\frac{2(N+1)}{N-2}}_{t,x}-norm taken on all scattering solutions at a certain level of energy below E(W,0) blows-up logarithmically as this level approaches the critical value E(W,0). We also give a similar result in the case of the radial energy-critical focusing semilinear Schr\"odinger equation. The proofs rely on the compactness argument of C. Kenig and F. Merle, on a classification result, due to the authors, at the energy level E(W,0), and on the analysis of the linearized equation around W.
