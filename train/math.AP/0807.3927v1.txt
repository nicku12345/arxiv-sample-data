We study behaviors of scalar quantities near the possible blow-up time, which is made of smooth solutions of the Euler equations, Navier-Stokes equations and the surface quasi-geostrophic equations. Integrating the dynamical equations of the scaling invariant norms, we derive the possible blow-up behaviors of the above quantities, from which we obtain new type of blow-up criteria and some necessary conditions for the blow-up.
