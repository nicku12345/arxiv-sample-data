We consider a class of degenerate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators in \mathbb{R}^{N}, of the kind \[ \mathcal{A}\equiv\sum_{i,j=1}^{p_{0}}a_{ij}\partial_{x_{i}x_{j}}^{2} +\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}b_{ij}x_{i}\partial_{x_{j}}% \] where (a_{ij}) ,(b_{ij})  are constant matrices, (a_{ij})  is symmetric positive definite on \mathbb{R} ^{p_{0}} (p_{0}\leq N), and (b_{ij})  is such that \mathcal{A} is hypoelliptic. For this class of operators we prove global L^{p} estimates (1<p<\infty) of the kind:% \[ \Vert \partial_{x_{i}x_{j}}^{2}u\Vert_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}% ^{N})}\leq c\{\Vert \mathcal{A}u\Vert_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})}+\Vert u\Vert_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}% ^{N})}\} \text{for}i,j=1,2,...,p_{0}% \] and corresponding weak (1,1) estimates. This result seems to be the first case of global estimates, in Lebesgue L^{p} spaces, for complete H\"{o}rmander's operators  \sum X_{i}^{2}+X_{0}, proved in absence of a structure of homogeneous group. We obtain the previous estimates as a byproduct of the following one, which is of interest in its own:% \[ \Vert \partial_{x_{i}x_{j}}^{2}u\Vert_{L^{p}(S)}\leq c\Vert Lu\Vert_{L^{p}(S)}% \] for any u\in C_{0}^{\infty}(S) , where S is the strip \mathbb{R}^{N}\times[ -1,1]  and L is the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck operator \mathcal{A}-\partial_{t}.
