The convergence to non-diffusive self-similar solutions is investigated for non-negative solutions to the Cauchy problem \partial_t u = \Delta_p u + |\nabla u|^q when the initial data converge to zero at infinity. Sufficient conditions on the exponents p>2 and q>1 are given that guarantee that the diffusion becomes negligible for large times and the L^\infty-norm of u(t) converges to a positive value as t\to\infty.
