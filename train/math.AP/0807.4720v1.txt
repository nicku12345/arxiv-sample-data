We introduce the Colombeau Quaternio Algebra and study its algebraic structure. We also study the dense ideal, dense in the algebraic sense, of the algebra of Colombeau generalized numbers and use this show the existence of a maximal ting of quotions which is Von Neumann regular. Recall that it is already known that then algebra of COlombeau generalized numbers is not Von Neumann regular. We also use the study of the dense ideals to give a criteria for a generalized holomorphic function to satisfy the identity theorem.   Aragona-Fernadez-Juriaans showed that a generalized holomorphic function has a power series. This is one of the ingredients use to prove the identity theorem.
