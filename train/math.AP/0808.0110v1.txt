We prove the local and global existence of solutions of the generalized micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) equation u_t =\Delta u+\lambda f(x)/g(u), u<1, in \Omega\times (0,\infty), u(x,t)=0 on \partial\Omega\times (0,\infty), u(x,0)=u_0 in \Omega, where \Omega\subset\Bbb{R}^n is a bounded domain, \lambda >0 is a constant, 0\le f\in C^{\alpha}(\overline{\Omega}), f\not\equiv 0, for some constant 0<\alpha<1, 0<g\in C^2((-\infty,1)) such that g'(s)\le 0 for any s<1 and u_0\in L^1(\Omega) with u_0\le a<1 for some constant a. We prove that there exists a constant \lambda^{\ast}=\lambda^{\ast}(\Omega, f,g)>0 such that the associated stationary problem has a solution for any 0\le\lambda<\lambda^* and has no solution for any \lambda>\lambda^*. We obtain comparison theorems for the generalized MEMS equation. Under a mild assumption on the initial value we prove the convergence of global solutions to the solution of the corresponding stationary elliptic equation as t\to\infty for any 0\le\lambda<\lambda^*. We also obtain various conditions for the existence of a touchdown time T>0 for the solution u. That is a time T>0 such that \lim_{t\nearrow T}\sup_{\Omega}u(\cdot,t)=1.
