We prove a contraction in L^1 property for the solutions of a nonlinear reaction--diffusion system whose special cases include intercellular transport as well as reversible chemical reactions. Assuming the existence of stationary solutions we show that the solutions stabilize as t tends to infinity. Moreover, in the special case of linear reaction terms, we prove the existence and the uniqueness (up to a multiplicative constant) of the stationary solution.
