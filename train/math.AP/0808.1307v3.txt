We establish long-time stability of multi-dimensional viscous shocks of a general class of symmetric hyperbolic--parabolic systems with variable multiplicities, notably including the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in dimensions d\ge 2. This extends the existing result established by K. Zumbrun for systems with characteristics of constant multiplicity to the ones with variable multiplicity, yielding the first such a stability result for (fast) MHD shocks. At the same time, we are able to drop a technical assumption on structure of the so--called glancing set that was necessarily used in previous analyses. The key idea to the improvements is to introduce a new simple argument for obtaining a L^1\to L^p resolvent bound in low--frequency regimes by employing the recent construction of degenerate Kreiss' symmetrizers by O. Gu\`es, G. M\'etivier, M. Williams, and K. Zumbrun. Thus, at the low-frequency resolvent bound level, our analysis gives an alternative to the earlier pointwise Green's function approach of K. Zumbrun. High--frequency solution operator bounds have been previously established entirely by nonlinear energy estimates.
