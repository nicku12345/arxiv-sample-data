We prove an analogue of a classical asymptotic stability result of standing waves of the Schr\"odinger equation originating in work by Soffer and Weinstein. Specifically, our result is a transposition on the lattice Z of a result by Mizumachi and it involves a discrete Schr\"odinger operator H. The decay rates on the potential are less stringent than in Mizumachi, since we require for the potential q\in \ell ^{1,1}. We also prove |e^{itH}(n,m)|\le C < t > ^{-1/3} for a fixed C requiring, in analogy to Goldberg and Schlag only q\in \ell ^{1,1} if H has no resonances and q\in \ell ^{1,2} if it has resonances. In this way we ease the hypotheses on H contained in Pelinovsky and Stefanov, which have a similar dispersion estimate.
