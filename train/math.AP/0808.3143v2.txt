In this note we show the existence of at least three nontrivial solutions to the following quasilinear elliptic equation -\Delta_p u = |u|^{p^*-2}u + \lambda f(x,u) in a smooth bounded domain \Omega of \R^N with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on \partial\Omega, where p^*=Np/(N-p) is the critical Sobolev exponent and \Delta_p u =div(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u) is the p-laplacian. The proof is based on variational arguments and the classical concentrated compactness method.
