A shell-type model of an inviscid fluid, previously considered in the literature, is investigated in absence of external force. Energy dissipation of positive solutions is proved and decay of energy like t^{-2} is established. Self-similar decaying positive solutions are introduced and proved to exist and classified. Coalescence and blow-up are obtained as a consequence, in the class of arbitrary sign solutions.
