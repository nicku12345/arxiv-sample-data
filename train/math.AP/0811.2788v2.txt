Motivated by the study of conditional stability of traveling waves, we give an elementary H^2 center stable manifold construction for quasilinear parabolic PDE, sidestepping apparently delicate regularity issues by the combination of a carefully chosen implicit fixed-point scheme and "damping-type" H^s energy estimates of a type familiar from the study of hyperbolic--parabolic and relaxation systems. An important feature of these methods is that they generalize to situations such as the hyperbolic--parabolic or relaxation case for which parabolic-type smoothing estimates are unavailable. As an application, we show conditional stability of Lax- or undercompressive shock waves of general quasilinear parabolic systems of conservation laws by a pointwise stability analysis on the center stable manifold.
