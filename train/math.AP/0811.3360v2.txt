The purpose of this paper is to study the parabolic system u_t^i-D_\alpha(a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}D_\beta u^j)=-div f^i in the generalized Morrey Space L_{\phi}^{2,\lambda} . We would like to understand the regularity of the solutions of this system. It will be shown that 1: if a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}\in C(\bar{Q_{T}}) then Du\in L_\phi^{2,\lambda}, and 2: if a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}\in VMO(Q_{T}) then Du\in L_\phi^{2,\lambda}. Moreover we will be able to obtain estimates on the gradient of the solutions to the system, which will tell us about the regularity of the solutions.
