The endpoint Strichartz estimates for two-dimensional Schrodinger equations were recovered by averaging the solutions in L^2 in the angular variable by Tao. For Schrodinger equations with defocusing inverse square potential, we proved that the homogeneous endpoint estimates hold under this setting. In particular, the original versions of endpoint estimates hold for radial data.
