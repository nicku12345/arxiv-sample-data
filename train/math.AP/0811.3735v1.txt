It is a classical result that every subharmonic function, defined and {\mathcal{L}}^p-integrable for some p, 0<p<+\infty, on the unit disk \mathbb{D} of the complex plane {\mathbb{C}} is for almost all \theta of the form o((1-| z|)^{-1/p}), uniformly as z\to e^{i\theta} in any Stolz domain. Recently Pavlovi\'c gave a related integral inequality for absolute values of harmonic functions, also defined on the unit disk in the complex plane. We generalize Pavlovi\'c's result to so called quasi-nearly subharmonic functions defined on rather general domains in {\mathbb {R}}^n, n\geq 2.
