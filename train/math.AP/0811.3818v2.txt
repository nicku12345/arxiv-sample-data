The Navier-Stokes systems for compressible fluids with density-dependent viscosities are considered in the present paper. These equations, in particular, include the ones which are rigorously derived recently as the Saint-Venant system for the motion of shallow water, from the Navier-Stokes system for incompressible flows with a moving free surface [14]. These compressible systems are degenerate when vacuum state appears. We study initial-boundary-value problems for such systems for both bounded spatial domains or periodic domains. The dynamics of weak solutions and vacuum states are investigated rigorously.   First, it is proved that the entropy weak solutions for general large initial data satisfying finite initial entropy exist globally in time. Next, for more regular initial data, there is a global entropy weak solution which is unique and regular with well-defined velocity field for short time, and the interface of initial vacuum propagates along particle path during this time period. Then, it is shown that for any global entropy weak solution, any (possibly existing) vacuum state must vanish within finite time. The velocity (even if regular enough and well-defined) blows up in finite time as the vacuum states vanish. Furthermore, after the vanishing of vacuum states, the global entropy weak solution becomes a strong solution and tends to the non-vacuum equilibrium state exponentially in time.
