We consider the semilinear wave equation with power nonlinearity in one space dimension. We first show the existence of a blow-up solution with a characteristic point. Then, we consider an arbitrary blow-up solution u(x,t), the graph x\mapsto T(x) of its blow-up points and \SS\subset  the set of all characteristic points, and show that the \SS has an empty interior. Finally, given x_0\in \SS, we show that in selfsimilar variables, the solution decomposes into a decoupled sum of (at least two) solitons with alternate signs and that T(x) forms a corner of angle \frac \pi 2 at x_0.
