We obtain several averaging lemmas for transport operator with a force term. These lemmas improve the regularity yet known by not considering the force term as part of an arbitrary right-hand side. Two methods are used: local variable changes or stationary phase. These new results are subjected to two non degeneracy assumptions. We characterize the optimal conditions of these assumptions to compare the obtained regularities according to the space and velocity variables. Our results are mainly in L^2, and for constant force, in L^p for 1<p \leq 2.
