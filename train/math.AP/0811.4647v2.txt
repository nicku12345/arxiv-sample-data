We study Liouville type of theorems for the Navier-Stokes and the Euler equations on \Bbb R^N, N\geq 2. Specifically, we prove that if a weak solution (v,p) satisfies |v|^2 +|p| \in L^1 (0,T; L^1(\Bbb R^N, w_1(x)dx)) and \int_{\Bbb R^N} p(x,t)w_2 (x)dx \geq0 for some weight functions w_1(x) and w_2 (x), then the solution is trivial, namely v=0 almost everywhere on \Bbb R^N \times (0, T). Similar results hold for the MHD Equations on \Bbb R^N, N\geq3.
