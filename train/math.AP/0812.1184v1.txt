We are concerned with viscous profiles (travelling waves and steady solutions) for mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems in one space variable. For a class of systems including the compressible Navier Stokes equation, these profiles satisfy a singular ordinary differential equation in the form \label{e:ab} dU / dt = F(U)/ z (U) . Here U takes values in R^d and F: R^d \to R^d is a regular function. The real valued function z (U) is as well regular, but the equation is singular because z (U) can attain the value 0. We focus on a small enough neighbourhood of a point \bar U satisfying F(\bar U) = \vec 0, z (\bar U) =0. From the point of view of the applications to the study of hyperbolic-parabolic systems this means restricting to systems with small total variation. We discuss how to extend the notions of center manifold and of uniformly stable manifold. Also, we give conditions ensuring that if z (U) \neq 0 at t=0 then z (U) \neq 0 at every t. We provide an example showing that if z(U) becomes zero in finite time then in general the solution U of equation \eqref{e:ab} is not continuously differentiable.
