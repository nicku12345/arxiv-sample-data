This paper is concerned with the stability of stationary solutions of the conservation law \partial_t u + \mathrm{div}_y A(y,u) -\Delta_y u=0, where the flux A is periodic with respect to its first variable. Essentially two kinds of asymptotic behaviours are studied here: the case when the equation is set on \R, and the case when it is endowed with periodic boundary conditions. In the whole space case, we first prove the existence of viscous stationary shocks - also called standing shocks - which connect two different periodic stationary solutions to one another. We prove that standing shocks are stable in L^1, provided the initial disturbance satisfies some appropriate boundedness conditions. We also extend this result to arbitrary initial data, but with some restrictions on the flux A. In the periodic case, we prove that periodic stationary solutions are always stable. The proof of this result relies on the derivation of uniform L^\infty bounds on the solution of the conservation law, and on sub- and super-solution techniques.
