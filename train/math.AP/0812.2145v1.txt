We deal with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, in two and three dimensions, when some vortex patches are prescribed as initial data i.e. when there is an internal boundary across which the vorticity is discontinuous. We show -thanks to an asymptotic expansion- that there is a sharp but smooth variation of the fluid vorticity into a internal layer moving with the flow of the Euler equations; as long as this later exists and as t * nu is small, where nu is the viscosity coefficient.
