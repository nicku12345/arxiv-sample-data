Following Fr\'enod and Sonnendr\"ucker, we consider the finite Larmor radius regime for a plasma submitted to a large magnetic field and take into account both the quasineutrality and the local thermodynamic equilibrium of the electrons. We then rigorously establish the asymptotic gyrokinetic limit of the rescaled and modified Vlasov-Poisson system in a three-dimensional setting with the help of an averaging lemma.
