An inequality of Hardy type is established for quadratic forms involving Dirac operator and a weight r^{-b} for functions in \R^n. The exact Hardy constant c_b=c_b(n) is found and generalized minimizers are given. The constant c_b vanishes on a countable set of b, which extends the known case n=2, b=0 which corresponds to the trivial Hardy inequality in \R^2. Analogous inequalities are proved in the case c_b=0 under constraints and, with error terms, for a bounded domain.
