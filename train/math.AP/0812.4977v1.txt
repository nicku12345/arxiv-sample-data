The large time behavior of nonnegative solutions to the reaction-diffusion equation \partial_t u=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u - u^p, (\alpha\in(0,2], p>1) posed on \mathbb{R}^N and supplemented with an integrable initial condition is studied. We show that the anomalous diffusion term determines the large time asymptotics for p>1+{\alpha}/{N}, while nonlinear effects win if p\leq1+{\alpha}/{N}.
