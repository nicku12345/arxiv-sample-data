We prove under general assumptions that solutions of the thin obstacle or Signorini problem in any space dimension achieve the optimal regularity C^{1,1/2}. This improves the known optimal regularity results by allowing the thin obstacle to be defined in an arbitrary C^{1,\beta} hypersurface, \beta>1/2, additionally, our proof covers any linear elliptic operator in divergence form with smooth coefficients. The main ingredients of the proof are a version of Almgren's monotonicity formula and the optimal regularity of global solutions.
