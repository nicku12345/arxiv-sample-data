Global existence and long-time behavior of solutions to a family of nonlinear fourth order evolution equations on R^d are studied. These equations constitute gradient flows for the perturbed information functionals F[u] = 1/(2\alpha) \int | D (u^\alpha) |^2 dx + \lambda/2 \int |x|^2 u dx with respect to the L^2-Wasserstein metric. The value of \alpha ranges from \alpha=1/2, corresponding to a simplified quantum drift diffusion model, to \alpha=1, corresponding to a thin film type equation.
