Let \Omega be a domain in \mathbb{R}^d, d\geq 2, and 1<p<\infty. Fix V\in L_{\mathrm{loc}}^\infty(\Omega). Consider the functional Q and its G\^{a}teaux derivative Q^\prime given by Q(u):= \frac{1}{p}\int_\Omega. (|\nabla u|^p+V|u|^p) \dx, Q^\prime (u):= -\nabla\cdot(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)+V|u|^{p-2} u. In this paper we discuss a few aspects of relations between functional-analytic properties of the functional Q and properties of positive solutions of the equation Q^\prime (u)=0.
