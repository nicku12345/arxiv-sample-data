A bilinear estimate in terms of Bourgain spaces associated with a linearised Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-type equation on the three-dimensional torus is shown. As a consequence, time localized linear and bilinear space time estimates for this equation are obtained. Applications to the local and global well-posedness of dispersion generalised KP-II equations are discussed. Especially it is proved that the periodic boundary value problem for the original KP-II equation is locally well-posed for data in the anisotropic Sobolev spaces H^s_xH^{\e}_y(\T^3), if s \ge \frac12 and \e > 0.
