Spatially periodic complex-valued solutions of the Burgers and KdV-Burgers equations are studied in this paper. It is shown that for any sufficiently large time T, there exists an explicit initial data such that its corresponding solution of the Burgers equation blows up at T. In addition, the global convergence and regularity of series solutions is established for initial data satisfying mild conditions.
