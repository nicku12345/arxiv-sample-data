We consider uniqueness of positive solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with double power nonlinearities. The condition to assure the existence of positive solutions to these types of equations has long been known. On the other hand for uniqueness, quite technical additional condition is proposed by Ouyang and Shi in 1998. In the present paper we remark that this additional condition is unnecessary.
