In this paper we derive a criterion for the breakdown of classical solutions to the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with zero viscosity and positive resistivity in \mathbb{R}^3. This result is analogous to the celebrated Beale-Kato-Majda's breakdown criterion for the inviscid Eluer equations of incompressible fluids. In \mathbb{R}^2 we establish global weak solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic equations with zero viscosity and positive resistivity for initial data in Sobolev space H^1(\mathbb{R}^2).
