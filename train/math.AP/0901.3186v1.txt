In this paper, we study the 3D Lam\'e system and establish its weighted positive definiteness for a certain range of elastic constants. By modifying the general theory developed in Maz'ya (2002), we then show, under the assumption of weighted positive definiteness, that the divergence of the classical Wiener integral for a boundary point guarantees the continuity of solutions to the Lam\'e system at this point.
