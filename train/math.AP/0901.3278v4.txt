In this paper we prove the nonexistence of global weak solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the isentropic gas in \Bbb R^N, N\geq 3, where the pressure law given by p(\rho)=a\rho^{\gamma},  a>0, 1<\gamma \leq \frac{N}{4}+\frac12. In this case if the initial data satisfies \int_{\Bbb R^N} \rho_0 (x)v_0 (x)\cdot x dx >0, then there exists no finite energy global weak solution which satisfies the integrability conditions  \rho |x|^2 \in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}} (0, \infty; L^1 (\Bbb R^N)) and  v\in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}} (0, \infty; L^{\frac{N}{N-1}} (\Bbb R^N)).
