In this paper, we study the 3D axi-symmetric Navier-Stokes Equations with swirl. We prove the global regularity of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for a family of large anisotropic initial data. Moreover, we obtain a global bound of the solution in terms of its initial data in some L^p norm. Our results also reveal some interesting dynamic growth behavior of the solution due to the interaction between the angular velocity and the angular vorticity fields.
