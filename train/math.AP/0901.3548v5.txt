We investigate the behaviour of solutions \phi = \phi^{(p)} to the one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation -\phi_{tt} + \phi_{xx} = -|\phi|^{p-1} \phi with initial data \phi(0,x) = \phi_0(x), \phi_t(0,x) = \phi_1(x), in the high exponent limit p \to \infty (holding \phi_0, \phi_1 fixed). We show that if the initial data \phi_0, \phi_1 are smooth with \phi_0 taking values in (-1,1) and obey a mild non-degeneracy condition, then \phi converges locally uniformly to a piecewise limit \phi^{(\infty)} taking values in the interval [-1,1], which can in principle be computed explicitly.
