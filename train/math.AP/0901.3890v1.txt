In [1], Cullen and Feldman proved existence of Lagrangian solutions for the semigeostrophic system in physical variables with initial potential vorticity in L^p, p>1. Here, we show that a subsequence of the Lagrangian solutions corresponding to a strongly convergent sequence of initial potential vorticities in L^1 converges strongly in L^q, q<\infty, to a Lagrangian solution, in particular extending the existence result of Cullen and Feldman to the case p=1. We also present a counterexample for Lagrangian solutions corresponding to a sequence of initial potential vorticities converging in \mathcal{BM}. The analytical tools used include techniques from optimal transportation, Ambrosio's results on transport by BV vector fields, and Orlicz spaces.   [1] M. Cullen and M.
