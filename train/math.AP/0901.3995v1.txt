It is shown that the fourth-order parabolic thin film equation with critical absorption admits the large time behaviour, where special logarithmic perturbations enter the standard source-type asymptotics. Such asymptpotic phenomena on existence of logarithmic factors are known for semilinear heat equation with absorption since the 1980s.
