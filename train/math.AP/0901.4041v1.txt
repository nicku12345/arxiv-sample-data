The asymptotic behaviour of the equilibrium configurations of a thin elastic plate is studied, as the thickness h of the plate goes to zero. More precisely, it is shown that critical points of the nonlinear elastic functional \mathcal E^h, whose energies (per unit thickness) are bounded by Ch^4, converge to critical points of the \Gamma-limit of h^{-4}\mathcal E^h. This is proved under the physical assumption that the energy density W(F) blows up as \det F\to0.
