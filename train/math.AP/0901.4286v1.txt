Various formal blow-up scenarious for the Navier--Stokes equaitons in 3D are discussed. A particular interest is payed to "twistor mechanisms" based on angular logarithmic blow-up travelling waves, and to a formation of "blow-up tornado" about the singular stationary Slezkin--Landau solutions (1934--44) of a submerged jet. A survey on various related aspects of singularity analysis for nonlinear parabolic PDEs is enclosed.
