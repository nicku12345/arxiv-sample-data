Five types of blow-up patterns that can occur for the 4th-order semilinear parabolic equation of reaction-diffusion type    u_t= -\Delta^2 u + |u|^{p-1} u \quad {in} \quad \ren \times (0,T), p>1, \quad \lim_{t \to T^-}\sup_{x \in \ren} |u(x,t)|= +\iy,  are discussed. For the semilinear heat equation u_t= \Delta u+ u^p, various blow-up patterns were under scrutiny since 1980s, while the case of higher-order diffusion was studied much less, regardless a wide range of its application.
