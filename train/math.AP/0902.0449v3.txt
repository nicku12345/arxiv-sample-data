Given a smooth domain \Omega\subset\RR^N such that 0 \in \partial\Omega and given a nonnegative smooth function \zeta on \partial\Omega, we study the behavior near 0 of positive solutions of -\Delta u=u^q in \Omega such that u = \zeta on \partial\Omega\setminus\{0\}. We prove that if \frac{N+1}{N-1} < q < \frac{N+2}{N-2}, then u(x)\leq C \abs{x}^{-\frac{2}{q-1}} and we compute the limit of \abs{x}^{\frac{2}{q-1}} u(x) as x \to 0. We also investigate the case q= \frac{N+1}{N-1}. The proofs rely on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of related equations on spherical domains.
