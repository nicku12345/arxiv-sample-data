We provide sufficient conditions of local solvability for partial differential operators with variable Colombeau coefficients. We mainly concentrate on operators which admit a right generalized pseudodifferential parametrix and on operators which are a bounded perturbation of a differential operator with constant Colombeau coefficients. The local solutions are intended in the Colombeau algebra \G(\Om) as well as in the dual \LL(\Gc(\Om),\wt{\C}).
