For the focusing mass-critical NLS iu_t+\Delta u=-|u|^{\frac 4d}u, it is conjectured that the only global non-scattering solution with ground state mass must be a solitary wave up to symmetries of the equation. In this paper, we settle the conjecture for H^1_x initial data in dimensions d=2,3 with spherical symmetry and d\ge 4 with certain splitting-spherically symmetric initial data.
