In \cite{duck-merle}, T. Duyckaerts and F. Merle studied the variational structure near the ground state solution W of the energy critical NLS and classified the solutions with the threshold energy E(W) in dimensions d=3,4,5 under the radial assumption. In this paper, we extend the results to all dimensions d\ge 6. The main issue in high dimensions is the non-Lipschitz continuity of the nonlinearity which we get around by making full use of the decay property of W.
