This work is devoted to prove existence of global weak solutions for a general isothermal model of capillary fluids derived by J.- E Dunn and J. Serrin (1985) [6], which can be used as a phase transition model. We improve the results of [5] by showing the existence of global weak solution in dimension two for initial data in the energy space, close to a stable equilibrium and with specific choices on the capillary coefficients. In particular we are interested in capillary coefficients approximating a constant capillarity coefficient. To finish we show the existence of global weak solution in dimension one for a specific type of capillary coefficients with large initial data in the energy space.
