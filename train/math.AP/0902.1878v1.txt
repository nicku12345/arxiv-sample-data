We consider the following Keller-Segel system of degenerate type:   \partial u / \partial t = \partial / \partial x (\partial u^m / \partial x - u^{q-1} \cdot \partial v / \partial x), x \in \R, t>0,   \partial^2 v / \partial x^2 - \gamma v + u, x \in \R, t>0, u(x,0) = u_0(x), x \in \R, where m>1, \gamma > 0, q \ge 2m. We shall first construct a weak solution u(x,t) of (KS) such that u^{m-1} is Lipschitz continuous and such that \displaystyle u^{m-1+\delta} for \delta>0 is of class C^1 with respect to the space variable x. As a by-product, we prove the property of finite speed of propagation of a weak solution u(x,t) of (KS), {\it i.e.,} that a weak solution u(x,t) of (KS) has a compact support in x for all t>0 if the initial data u_0(x) has a compact support in \R. We also give both upper and lower bounds of the interface of the weak solution u of (KS).
