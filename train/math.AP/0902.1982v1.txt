This paper is dedicated to the study of the initial value problem for density dependent incompressible viscous fluids in \R^{N} with N\geq2. We address the question of well-posedness for {\it large} data having critical Besov regularity and we aim at stating well-posedness in functional spaces as close as possible to the ones imposed in the incompressible Navier Stokes system by Cannone, Meyer and Planchon where u_{0}\in B^{\NN-1}_{p,\infty} with 1\leq p<+\infty. This improves the analysis of H. Abidi, R. Danchin and M. Paicu where u_{0} is considered belonging to B^{\NN-1}_{p,1} with 1\leq p<2N. Our result relies on a new a priori estimate for transport equation introduce by Bahouri, Chemin and Danchin when the velocity u is not considered Lipschitz.
