Extending our previous work in the strictly parabolic case, we show that a linearly unstable Lax-type viscous shock solution of a general quasilinear hyperbolic--parabolic system of conservation laws possesses a translation-invariant center stable manifold within which it is nonlinearly orbitally stable with respect to small L^1\cap H^3 perturbations, converging time-asymptotically to a translate of the unperturbed wave. That is, for a shock with p unstable eigenvalues, we establish conditional stability on a codimension-p manifold of initial data, with sharp rates of decay in all L^p. For p=0, we recover the result of unconditional stability obtained by Mascia and Zumbrun. The main new difficulty in the hyperbolic--parabolic case is to construct an invariant manifold in the absence of parabolic smoothing.
