We study the self-similar solutions of the equation \[ u_{t}-div(| \nabla u| ^{p-2}\nabla u)=0, \] in \mathbb{R}^{N}, when p>2. We make a complete study of the existence and possible uniqueness of solutions of the form \[ u(x,t)=(\pm t)^{-\alpha/\beta}w((\pm t)^{-1/\beta}| x|) \] of any sign, regular or singular at x=0. Among them we find solutions with an expanding compact support or a shrinking hole (for t>0), or a spreading compact support or a focussing hole (for t<0). When t<0, we show the existence of positive solutions oscillating around the particular solution U(x,t)=C_{N,p}(| x| ^{p}/(-t))^{1/(p-2)}.
