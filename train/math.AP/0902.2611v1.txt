We consider a pattern-forming system in two space dimensions defined by an energy G_e. The functional G_e models strong phase separation in AB diblock copolymer melts, and patterns are represented by {0,1}-valued functions; the values 0 and 1 correspond to the A and B phases. The parameter e is the ratio between the intrinsic, material length scale and the scale of the domain. We show that in the limit (as e goes to 0) any sequence u_e of patterns with uniformly bounded energy G_e(u_e) becomes stripe-like: the pattern becomes locally one-dimensional and resembles a periodic stripe pattern of periodicity O(e). In the limit the stripes become uniform in width and increasingly straight.   Our results are formulated as a convergence theorem, which states that the functional G_e Gamma-converges to a limit functional G_0. This limit functional is defined on fields of rank-one projections, which represent the local direction of the stripe pattern. The functional G_0 is only finite if the projection field solves a version of the Eikonal equation, and in that case it is the L^2-norm of the divergence of the projection field, or equivalently the L^2-norm of the curvature of the field.   At the level of patterns the converging objects are the jump measures |grad(u_e)| combined with the projection fields corresponding to the tangents to the jump set. The central inequality from Peletier & Roeger, (Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, to appear), provides the initial estimate and leads to weak measure-function-pair convergence. We obtain strong convergence by exploiting the non-intersection property of the jump set.
