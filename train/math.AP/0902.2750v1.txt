We study qualitative and quantitative properties of local weak solutions of the fast p-Laplacian equation, \partial_t u=\Delta_{p}u, with 1<p<2. Our main results are quantitative positivity and boundedness estimates for locally defined solutions in domains of \RR^n\times [0,T]. We combine these lower and upper bounds in different forms of intrinsic Harnack inequalities, which are new in the very fast diffusion range, that is when 1<p \le 2n/(n+1). The boundedness results may be also extended to the limit case p=1, while the positivity estimates cannot.   We prove the existence as well as sharp asymptotic estimates for the so-called large solutions for any 1<p<2, and point out their main properties.   We also prove a new local energy inequality for suitable norms of the gradients of the solutions. As a consequence, we prove that bounded local weak solutions are indeed local strong solutions, more precisely \partial_t u\in L^2_{\rm loc}.
