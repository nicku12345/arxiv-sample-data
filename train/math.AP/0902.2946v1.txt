The existence of positive equilibrium solutions to age-dependent population equations with nonlinear diffusion is studied in an abstract setting. By introducing a bifurcation parameter measuring the intensity of the fertility it is shown that a branch of (positive) equilibria bifurcates from the trivial equilibrium. In some cases the direction of bifurcation is analyzed.
