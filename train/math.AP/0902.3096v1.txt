We prove that the singularities of a potential in the two and three dimensional Schr\"odinger equation are the same as the singularities of the Born approximation (Diffraction Tomography), obtained from backscattering inverse data, with an accuracy of 1/2^- derivative in the scale of L^2-based Sobolev spaces. The key point is the study of the smoothing properties of the quartic term in the Neumann-Born expansion of the scattering amplitude in 3D, together with a Leibniz formula for multiple scattering valid in any dimension.
