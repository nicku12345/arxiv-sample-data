The configurational distribution function, solution of an evolution (diffusion) equation of the Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski type, is (at least part of) the corner stone of polymer dynamics: it is the key to calculating the stress tensor components. This can be reckoned from \cite{bird2}, where a wealth of calculation details is presented regarding various polymer chain models and their ability to accurately predict viscoelastic flows. One of the simplest polymer chain idealization is the Bird and Warner's model of finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) chains. In this work we offer a proof that the steady state configurational distribution equation has unique solutions irrespective of the (outer) flow velocity gradients (i.e. for both slow and fast flows).
