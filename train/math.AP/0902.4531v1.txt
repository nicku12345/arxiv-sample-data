In this paper we will focus on a parabolic degenerate system with respect to unknown functions u and w on a bounded domain of the two-dimensional Euclidean space. This system appears as a mathematical model for some biological processes. Global existence and uniqueness of a nonnegative classical H\"older continuous solution are proved. The last part of the paper is devoted to the study of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions.
