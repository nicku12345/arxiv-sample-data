The goal of this paper is to set up a framework designed to take into account the characteristics of sediment particles when transported by water. Our protocol consists in describing the characteristics of sediment particles via an additional variable, and to build operators involving this new variable, modeling the evolution of the particle characteristics. Several such operators are proposed, some based on principles of relaxation toward an equilibrium, and others on a description of the particles' aggregation and fragmentation process. A discrete version of the latter is also offered for numerical settings.
