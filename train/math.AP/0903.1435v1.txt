We study a strongly coupled system consisting of a parabolic equation and a singular Hamilton-Jacobi equation in one space dimension. This system describes the dynamics of dislocation densities in a material submitted to an exterior applied stress. The equations are written on a bounded interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions and require special attention to the boundary. We prove a result of global existence of a solution. The method of the proof consists in considering first a parabolic regularization of the full system, and then passing to the limit. We show some uniform bounds on this solution which uses in particular an entropy estimate for the densities.
