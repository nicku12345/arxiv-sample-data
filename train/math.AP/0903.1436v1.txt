In order to extend the blow-up criterion of solutions to the Euler equations, Kozono and Taniuchi have proved a logarithmic Sobolev inequality by means of isotropic (elliptic) BMO norm. In this paper, we show a parabolic version of the Kozono-Taniuchi inequality by means of anisotropic (parabolic) BMO norm. More precisely we give an upper bound for the L^{\infty} norm of a function in terms of its parabolic BMO norm, up to a logarithmic correction involving its norm in some Sobolev space. As an application, we also explain how to apply this inequality in order to establish a long-time existence result for a class of nonlinear parabolic problems.
