In this paper, we study the rate of convergence in periodic homogenization of scalar ordinary differential equations. We provide a quantitative error estimate between the solutions of a first-order ordinary differential equation with rapidly oscillating coefficients and the limiting homogenized solution. As an application of our result, we obtain an error estimate for the solution of some particular linear transport equations.
