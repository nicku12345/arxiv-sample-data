We study regularity criteria for the d-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We prove in this paper that if u\in L_\infty^tL_{d}^x((0,T)\times {\mathbb R}^d) is a Leray-Hopf weak solution, then u is smooth and unique in (0,T)\times \bR^d. This generalizes a result by Escauriaza, Seregin and \v{S}ver\'ak. Additionally, we show that if T=\infty then u goes to zero as t goes to infinity.
