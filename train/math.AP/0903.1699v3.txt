In this paper, we study fully non-linear elliptic equations in non-divergence form which can be degenerate when "the gradient is small". Typical examples are either equations involving the m-Laplace operator or Bellman-Isaacs equations from stochastic control problems. We establish an Alexandroff-Bakelman-Pucci estimate and we prove a Harnack inequality for viscosity solutions of such degenerate elliptic equations.
