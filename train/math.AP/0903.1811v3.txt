This work is devoted to the study of a Liouville comparison principle for entire weak solutions of quasilinear differential inequalities of the form A(u) + |u|^{q-1}u \leq A(v) + |v|^{q-1}v on {\Bbb R}^n, where n\geq 1, q is positive, and the operator A(w) belongs to a class of the so-called \alpha-monotone operators. Typical examples of such operators are the p-Laplacian and its well-known modifications. The results improve and supplement those in [1].
