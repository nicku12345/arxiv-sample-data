We study the behavior of p-Dirichlet optimal design problem with volume constraint for p large. As the limit as p goes to infinity, we find a limiting free boundary problem governed by the infinity-Laplacian operator. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for uniqueness of the limiting problem and, under such a condition, we determine precisely the optimal configuration for the limiting problem. Finally, we establish convergence results for the free boundaries.
