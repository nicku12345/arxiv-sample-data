We study the long-time asymptotics of solutions of the uniformly parabolic equation \[ u_t + F(D^2u) = 0 \quad {in} \R^n\times \R_+, \] for a positively homogeneous operator F, subject to the initial condition u(x,0) = g(x), under the assumption that g does not change sign and possesses sufficient decay at infinity. We prove the existence of a unique positive solution \Phi^+ and negative solution \Phi^-, which satisfy the self-similarity relations \[ \Phi^\pm (x,t) = \lambda^{\alpha^\pm} \Phi^\pm (\lambda^{1/2} x, \lambda t). \] We prove that the rescaled limit of the solution of the Cauchy problem with nonnegative (nonpositive) initial data converges to \Phi^+ (\Phi^-) locally uniformly in \R^n \times \R_+. The anomalous exponents \alpha^+ and \alpha^- are identified as the principal half-eigenvalues of a certain elliptic operator associated to F in \R^n.
