The Cauchy problem for the classical Dirac-Klein-Gordon system in two space dimensions is globally well-posed for L^2 Schoedinger data and wave data in H^{1/2} \times H^{-1/2}. In the case of smooth data there exists a global smooth (classical) solution. The proof uses function spaces of Bourgain type based on Besov spaces - previously applied by Colliander, Kenig and Staffilani for generalized Benjamin-Ono equations and also by Bejenaru, Herr, Holmer and Tataru for the 2D Zakharov system - and the null structure of the system detected by d'Ancona, Foschi and Selberg, and a refined bilinear Strichartz estimate due to Selberg. The global existence proof uses an idea of Colliander, Holmer and Tzirakis for the 1D Zakharov system.
