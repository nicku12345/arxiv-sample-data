Motivated by certain mathematical models for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), we give upper and lower L^\infty estimates for the minimal solutions of nonlinear eigenvalue problems of the form -\Delta u = \lambda f(x) F(u) on a smooth bounded domain  \Omega in \IR^N. We are mainly interested in the {\it pull-in distance}, that is the L^\infty-norm of the extremal solution u^* and how it depends on the geometry of the domain, the dimension of the space, and the so-called {\it permittivity profile} f. In particular, our results provide mathematical proofs for various observed phenomena, as well as rigorous derivations for several estimates obtained numerically by Pelesko \cite{P}, Guo-Pan-Ward \cite{GPW} and others in the case of the MEMS non-linearity F(u)=\frac{1}{(1-u)^2} and for power-law permittivity profiles f(x)=|x|^\alpha.
