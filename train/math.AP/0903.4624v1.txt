Let M be an N-function satisfying the \Delta_2- condition, let \omega, \vp be two other functions, \omega\ge 0. We study Hardy-type inequalities \[ \int_{\rp} M(\omega (x)|u(x)|) {\rm exp}(-\vp (x))dx \le C\int_{\rp} M(|u'(x)|) {\rm exp}(-\vp (x))dx, \] where u belongs to some dilation invariant set {\cal R} contained in the space of locally absolutely continuous functions. We give sufficient conditions the triple (\omega,\vp,M) must satisfy in order to have such inequalities valid for u from a given set {\cal R}. The set {\cal R} can be smaller than the set of Hardy transforms. Bounds for constants, retrieving classical Hardy inequalities with best constants, are also given.
