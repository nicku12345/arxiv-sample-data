Let {\cal E} be a Dirichlet form on L_2(X) and \Omega an open subset of X. Then one can define Dirichlet forms {\cal E}_D, or {\cal E}_N, corresponding to {\cal E} but with Dirichlet, or Neumann, boundary conditions imposed on the boundary \partial\Omega of \Omega. If S, S^D and S^N are the associated submarkovian semigroups we prove, under general assumptions of regularity and locality, that S_t\phi = S^D_t\phi for all \phi\in L_2(\Omega) and t>0 if and only if the capacity {\mathop{\rm cap}}_\Omega(\partial\Omega) of \partial \Omega relative to \Omega is zero. Moreover, if S is conservative, i.e. stochastically complete, then {\mathop{\rm cap}}_\Omega(\partial\Omega)=0 if and only if S^D is conservative on L_2(\Omega). Under slightly more stringent assumptions we also prove that the vanishing of the relative capacity is equivalent to S^D_t \phi = S^N_t \phi for all \phi\in L_2(\Omega) and t>0.
