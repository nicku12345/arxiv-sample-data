We study a class of mean curvature equations -\mathcal Mu=H+\lambda u^p where \mathcal M denotes the mean curvature operator and for p\geq 1. We show that there exists an extremal parameter \lambda^* such that this equation admits a minimal weak solutions for all \lambda \in [0,\lambda^*], while no weak solutions exists for \lambda >\lambda^* (weak solutions will be defined as critical points of a suitable functional). In the radially symmetric case, we then show that minimal weak solutions are classical solutions for all \lambda\in [0,\lambda^*] and that another branch of classical solutions exists in a neighborhood (\lambda_*-\eta,\lambda^*) of \lambda^*.
