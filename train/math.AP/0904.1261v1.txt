We consider the singular perturbation problem  \Delta u_\epsilon=\beta_\epsilon(u_\epsilon),  where \beta_\epsilon(s)=\frac{1}{\epsilon}\beta(\frac{s}{\epsilon}), \beta is a Lipschitz continuous function such that \beta>0 in (0, 1), \beta\equiv 0 outside (0, 1) and \int_0^1\beta(s) ds={1/2}.   We construct an example exhibiting a {\em degenerate singularity} as \epsilon_k\searrow 0. More precisely, there is a sequence of solutions u_{\epsilon_k}\to u as k\to \infty, and there exists x^0\in\partial\{u>0\} such that  \frac{u(x^0+r\cdot)}{r} \to 0 \textrm{as} r\to 0. Known results suggest that this singularity must be {\em unstable}, which makes it hard to capture analytically and numerically. Our result answers a question raised by Jean-Michel Roquejoffre at the FBP'08 in Stockholm.
