This paper is dedicated to the study of viscous compressible barotropic fluids in dimension N\geq2. We address the question of well-posedness for {\it large} data having critical Besov regularity. Our result improve the analysis of R. Danchin and of B. Haspot, by the fact that we choose initial density more general in B^{\NN}_{p,1} with 1\leq p<+\infty. Our result relies on a new a priori estimate for the velocity, where we introduce a new structure to \textit{kill} the coupling between the density and the velocity. In particular our result is the first where we obtain uniqueness without imposing hypothesis on the gradient of the density.
