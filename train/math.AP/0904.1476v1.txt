The aim of this paper is to show an existence theorem for a kinetic model of coagulation-fragmentation with initial data satisfying the natural physical bounds, and assumptions of finite number of particles and finite L^p-norm. We use the notion of renormalized solutions introduced dy DiPerna and Lions, because of the lack of \textit{a priori} estimates. The proof is based on weak-compactness methods in L^1, allowed by L^p-norms propagation.
