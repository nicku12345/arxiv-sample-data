We construct a function u \in W^{1,1}_{\mathrm{loc}} (B(0,1)) which is a solution to \Div (A \nabla u)=0 in the sense of distributions, where A is continuous and u \not \in W^{1,p}_{\mathrm{loc}} (B(0,1)) for p > 1. We also give a function u \in W^{1,1}_{\mathrm{loc}} (B(0,1)) such that u \in W^{1,p}_{\mathrm{loc}}(B(0,1)) for every p < \infty, u satisfies \Div (A \nabla u)=0 with A continuous but u \not \in W^{1, \infty}_{\mathrm{loc}}(B(0,1)).
