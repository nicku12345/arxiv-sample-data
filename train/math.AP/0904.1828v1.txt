We investigate, on a bounded domain \Omega of \R^2 with fixed S^1-valued boundary condition g of degree d>0, the asymptotic behaviour of solutions u_{\varepsilon,\delta} of a class of Ginzburg-Landau equations driven by two parameter : the usual Ginzburg-Landau parameter, denoted \varepsilon, and the scale parameter \delta of a geometry provided by a field of 2\times 2 positive definite matrices x\to A(\frac{x}{\delta}). The field \R^2\ni x\to A(x) is of class W^{2,\infty} and periodic. We show, for a suitable choice of the \varepsilon's depending on \delta, the existence of a limit configuration u_\infty\in H^1_g(\Omega,S^1), which, out of a finite set of singular points, is a weak solution of the equation of S^1-valued harmonic functions for the geometry related to the usual homogenized matrix A^0.
