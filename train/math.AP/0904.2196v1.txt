We give a construction of a divergence-free vector field u_0 \in H^s \cap B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}, for all s<1/2, such that any Leray-Hopf solution to the Navier-Stokes equation starting from u_0 is discontinuous at t=0 in the metric of B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}. For the Euler equation a similar result is proved in all Besov spaces B^s_{r,\infty} where s>0 if r>2, and s>n(2/r-1) if 1 \leq r \leq 2.
