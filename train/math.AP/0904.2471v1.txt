This paper analyses a nonlinear age-maturity structured system which arises as a model of the blood cellular production in the bone marrow. The resulting model is a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation in which there is a distributed temporal delay and a retardation in the maturation variable. We prove that uniqueness of solutions depends only on small maturity cells (stem cells) and we give a result of invariance.
