In this paper, we investigate a nonlinear partial differential equation, arising from a model of cellular proliferation. This model describes the production of blood cells in the bone marrow. It is represented by a partial differential equation with a retardation of the maturation variable and a distributed temporal delay. Our aim is to prove that the behaviour of primitive cells influences the global behaviour of the population.
