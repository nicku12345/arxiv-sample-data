This article investigates the long-time behaviour of parabolic scalar conservation laws of the type \partial_t u + \mathrm{div}_yA(y,u) - \Delta_y u=0, where y\in\mathbb R^N and the flux A is periodic in y. More specifically, we consider the case when the initial data is an L^1 disturbance of a stationary periodic solution. We show, under polynomial growth assumptions on the flux, that the difference between u and the stationary solution vanishes for large times in L^1 norm. The proof uses a self-similar change of variables which is well-suited for the analysis of the long time behaviour of parabolic equations. Then, convergence in self-similar variables follows from arguments from dynamical systems theory. One crucial point is to obtain compactness in L^1 on the family of rescaled solutions; this is achieved by deriving uniform bounds in weighted L^2 spaces.
