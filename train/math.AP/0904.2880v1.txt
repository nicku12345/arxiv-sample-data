A standard bilinear L^2 Strichartz estimate for the wave equation, which underlies the theory of X^{s,b} spaces of Bourgain and Klainerman-Machedon, asserts (roughly speaking) that if two finite-energy solutions to the wave equation are supported in transverse regions of the light cone in frequency space, then their product lies in spacetime L^2 with a quantitative bound. In this paper we consider the \emph{inverse problem} for this estimate: if the product of two waves has large L^2 norm, what does this tell us about the waves themselves? The main result, roughly speaking, is that the lower-frequency wave is dispersed away from a bounded number of light rays. This result will be used in a forthcoming paper \cite{tao:heatwave4} of the author on the global regularity problem for wave maps.
