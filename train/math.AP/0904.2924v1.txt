This paper is motivated by the study of a version of the so-called Schrodinger-Poisson-Slater problem:  - \Delta u + \omega u + \lambda (u^2 \star \frac{1}{|x|}) u=|u|^{p-2}u, where u \in H^1(\R^3). We are concerned mostly with p \in (2,3). The behavior of radial minimizers motivates the study of the static case \omega=0. Among other things, we obtain a general lower bound for the Coulomb energy, that could be useful in other frameworks. The radial and nonradial cases turn out to yield essentially different situations.
