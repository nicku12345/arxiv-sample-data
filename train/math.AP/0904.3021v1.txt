We consider the mass concentration phenomenon for the L^2-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of higher orders. We show that any solution u to iu_{t} + (-\Delta)^{\frac\alpha 2} u =\pm |u|^\frac{2\alpha}{d}u, u(0,\cdot)\in L^2 for \alpha >2, which blows up in a finite time, satisfies a mass concentration phenomenon near the blow-up time. We verify that as \alpha increases, the size of region capturing a mass concentration gets wider due to the stronger dispersive effect.
