We study the well-posedness and regularity of the generalized Navier-Stokes equations with initial data in a new critical space   Q_{\alpha;\infty}^{\beta,-1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=\nabla\cdot(Q_{\alpha}^{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{n}))^{n}, \beta\in({1/2},1) which is larger than some known critical homogeneous Besov spaces. Here Q_{\alpha}^{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) is a space defined as the set of all measurable functions with \sup(l(I))^{2(\alpha+\beta-1)-n}\int_{I}\int_{I}\frac{|f(x)-f(y)|^{2}}{|x-y|^{n+2(\alpha-\beta+1)}}dxdy<\infty where the supremum is taken over all cubes I with the edge length l(I) and the edges parallel to the coordinate axes in \mathbb{R}^{n}. In order to study the well-posedness and regularity, we give a Carleson measure characterization of Q_{\alpha}^{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) by investigating a new type of tent spaces and an atomic decomposition of the predual for Q_{\alpha}^{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{n}). In addition, our regularity results apply to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with initial data in Q_{\alpha;\infty}^{1,-1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}).
