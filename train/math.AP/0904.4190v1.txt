We prove that rank-(n-1) convexity does not imply {\mathcal S}-quasiconvexity (i.e., quasiconvexity with respect to divergence free fields) in {\mathbb M}^{m\times n} for m>n, by adapting the well-known Sverak's counterexample [5] to the solenoidal setting. On the other hand, we also remark that rank-(n-1) convexity and {\mathcal S}-quasiconvexity turn out to be equivalent in the space of n\times n diagonal matrices. This follows by a generalization of Mueller's work [4].
