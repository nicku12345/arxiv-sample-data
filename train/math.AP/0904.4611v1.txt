We study the following Schr\"odinger-Poisson system (P_\lambda){ll}   -\Delta u + V(x)u+\lambda \phi (x) u =Q(x)u^{p}, x\in \mathbb{R}^3 \\   -\Delta\phi = u^2, \lim\limits_{|x|\to +\infty}\phi(x)=0, u>0, where \lambda\geqslant0 is a parameter, 1 < p < +\infty, V(x) and Q(x) are sign-changing or non-positive functions in  L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3). When V(x)\equiv Q(x)\equiv1, D.Ruiz \cite{RuizD-JFA} proved that (P_\lambda) with p\in(2,5) has always a positive radial solution, but (P_\lambda) with p\in(1,2] has solution only if \lambda>0 small enough and no any nontrivial solution if \lambda\geqslant{1/4}. By using sub-supersolution method, we prove that there exists \lambda_0>0 such that (P_\lambda) with p\in(1,+\infty) has always a bound state (H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) solution) for \lambda\in[0,\lambda_0) and certain functions V(x) and Q(x) in  L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3). Moreover, for every \lambda\in[0,\lambda_0), the solutions u_\lambda of \rm (P_\lambda) converges, along a subsequence, to a solution of (P_0) in H^1 as \lambda \to 0.
