In this paper we show a general Strichartz estimate for certain perturbed wave equation, and here we can drop the nontrapping hypothesis and handle trapping obstacles with some loss of derivatives for data in the local energy decay estimates. Then we give the obstacle version of sharp life span for semilinear wave equations when n=3,p<p_c, by using a real interpolation method, and by getting a corresponding finite time Strichartz estimates(see section 3). Finally, as an application of the general Strichartz estimates we have gained, we get the Strauss conjecture for semilinear wave equations with several convex obstacles when n=3,4(see Section 4).
