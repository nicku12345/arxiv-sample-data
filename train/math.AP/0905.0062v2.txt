In this paper we study the stability of the self-similar solutions of the binormal flow, which is a model for the dynamics of vortex filaments in fluids and super-fluids. These particular solutions \chi_a(t,x) form a family of evolving regular curves of \mathbb R^3 that develop a singularity in finite time, indexed by a parameter a>0. We consider curves that are small regular perturbations of \chi_a(t_0,x) for a fixed time t_0. In particular, their curvature is not vanishing at infinity, so we are not in the context of known results of local existence for the binormal flow. Nevertheless, we construct in this article solutions of the binormal flow with these initial data. Moreover, these solutions become also singular in finite time. Our approach uses the Hasimoto transform what leads us to study the long-time behavior of a 1D cubic NLS equation with time-depending coefficients and small regular perturbations of the constant solution as initial data. We prove asymptotic completeness for this equation in appropriate function spaces.
