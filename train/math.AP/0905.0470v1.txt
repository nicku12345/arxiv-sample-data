Multi-soliton solutions, i.e. solutions behaving as the sum of N given solitons as t\to +\infty, were constructed in previous works for the L2 critical and subcritical (NLS) and (gKdV) equations.   In this paper, we extend the construction of multi-soliton solutions to the L2 supercritical case both for (gKdV) and (NLS) equations, using a topological argument to control the direction of instability.
