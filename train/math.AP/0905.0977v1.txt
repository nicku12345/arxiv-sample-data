We give a brief survey on some new developments on elliptic operators on manifolds with polyhedral singularities. The material essentially corresponds to a talk given by the author during the Conference "Elliptic and Hyperbolic Equations on Singular Spaces", October 27 - 31, 2008, at the MSRI, University of Berkeley.
