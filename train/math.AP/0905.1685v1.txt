We study interior C^{1, \al} regularity of viscosity solutions of the parabolic Monge-Amp\'ere equation u_t = b(x,t) \ddua, with exponent p >0 and with coefficients b which are bounded and measurable. We show that when p is less than the critical power \frac{1}{n-2} then solutions become instantly C^{1, \al} in the interior. Also, we prove the same result for any power p>0 at those points where either the solution separates from the initial data, or where the initial data is C^{1, \beta}.
