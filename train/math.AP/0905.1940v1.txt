We study the regularity of the extremal solution of the semilinear biharmonic equation \beta \Delta^2 u-\tau \Delta u=\frac{\lambda}{(1-u)^2} on a ball B \subset \R^N, under Navier boundary conditions u=\Delta u=0 on \partial B, where \lambda >0 is a parameter, while \tau>0, \beta>0 are fixed constants. It is known that there exists a \lambda^{*} such that for \lambda>\lambda^{*} there is no solution while for \lambda<\lambda^{*} there is a branch of minimal solutions. Our main result asserts that the extremal solution u^{*} is regular (\sup_{B}u^{*}<1) for N\leq 8 and \beta, \tau>0 and it is singular (\sup_{B}u^{*}=1) for N\geq 9, \beta>0, and \tau>0 with \frac{\tau}{\beta} small. Our proof for the singularity of extremal solutions in dimensions N\geq 9 is based on certain improved Hardy-Rellich inequalities.
