We consider nonnegative solutions of a parabolic equation in a cylinder D \timesI, where D is a noncompact domain of a Riemannian manifold and I =(0,T) with 0 < T \le \infty or I=(-\infty,0). Under the assumption [SSP] (i.e., the constant function 1 is a semismall perturbation of the associated elliptic operator on D), we establish an integral representation theorem of nonnegative solutions: In the case I =(0,T), any nonnegative solution is represented uniquely by an integral on (D \times \{0 \}) \cup (\partial_M D \times [0,T)), where \partial_M D is the Martin boundary of D for the elliptic operator; and in the case I=(-\infty,0), any nonnegative solution is represented uniquely by the sum of an integral on \partial_M D \times (-\infty,0) and a constant multiple of a particular solution. We also show that [SSP] implies the condition [SIU] (i.e., the associated heat kernel is semi-intrinsically ultracontractive).
