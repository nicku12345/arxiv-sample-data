We consider solutions u(t) to the 3d NLS equation i\partial_t u + \Delta u + |u|^2u=0 such that \|xu(t)\|_{L^2} = \infty and u(t) is nonradial. Denoting by M[u] and E[u], the mass and energy, respectively, of a solution u, and by Q(x) the ground state solution to -Q+\Delta Q+|Q|^2Q=0, we prove the following: if M[u]E[u]<M[Q]E[Q] and \|u_0\|_{L^2}\|\nabla u_0\|_{L^2}>\|Q\|_{L^2}\|\nabla Q\|_{L^2}, then either u(t) blows-up in finite positive time or u(t) exists globally for all positive time and there exists a sequence of times t_n\to +\infty such that \|\nabla u(t_n)\|_{L^2} \to \infty. Similar statements hold for negative time.
