Let A_H be the Aronsson operator associated with a Hamiltonian H(x,z,p). Aronsson operators arise from L^\infty variational problems, two person game theory, control problems, etc. In this paper, we prove, under suitable conditions, that if u\in W^{1,\infty}_{\rm loc}(\Omega) is simultaneously a viscosity solution of both of the equations A_H(u)=f(x) and A_H(u)=g(x) in \Omega, where f, g\in C(\Omega), then f=g. The assumption u\in W_{loc}^{1,\infty}(\Omega) can be relaxed to u\in C(\Omega) in many interesting situations. Also, we prove that if f,g,u\in C(\Omega) and u is simultaneously a viscosity solution of the equations {\Delta_\infty u\over |Du|^2}=-f(x) and {\Delta_{\infty}u\over |Du|^2}=-g(x) in \Omega then f=g. This answers a question posed in Peres, Schramm, Scheffield and Wilson [PSSW] concerning whether or not the value function uniquely determines the running cost in the "tug-of-war" game.
