If \Omega is a bounded domain in \mathbb R^N and f a continuous increasing function satisfying a super linear growth condition at infinity, we study the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the problem (P): \partial_tu-\Delta u+f(u)=0 in Q_\infty^\Omega:=\Omega\times (0,\infty), u=\infty on the parabolic boundary \partial_{p}Q. We prove that in most cases, the existence and uniqueness is reduced to the same property for the associated stationary equation in \Omega.
