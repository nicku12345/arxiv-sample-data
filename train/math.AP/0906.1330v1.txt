We investigate the behavior, as a small parameter tends to zero, of a nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation. Given a rather general initial data, we perform a rigorous analysis of both the generation and the motion of interface, and obtain a new estimate for its thickness. The limit problem involves motion by mean curvature together with a nonlocal effect (which allows the possibility of nontrivial stationary state).
