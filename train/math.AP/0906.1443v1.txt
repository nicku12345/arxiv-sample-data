This paper is devoted to the study of semi-stable radial solutions u\in H^1(B_1) of -\Delta u=g(u) {in} B_1\setminus \{0\}, where g\in C^1(R) is a general nonlinearity and B_1 is the unit ball of R^N. We establish sharp pointwise estimates for such solutions. As an application of these results, we obtain optimal pointwise estimates for the extremal solution and its derivatives (up to order three) of the semilinear elliptic equation -\Delta u=\lambda f(u), posed in B_1, with Dirichlet data u|_{\partial B_1}=0, and a continuous, positive, nondecreasing and convex function f on [0,\infty) such that f(s)/s\to\infty as s\to\infty.
