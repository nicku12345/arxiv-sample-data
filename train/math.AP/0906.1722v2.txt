We consider systems of ODEs that describe the dynamics of particles. Each particle satisfies a Newton law (including the acceleration term) where the force is created by the interactions with the other particles and with a periodic potential. The presence of a damping term allows the system to be monotone. Our study takes into account the fact that the particles can be different. After a proper hyperbolic rescaling, we show that the solutions to this system of ODEs converge to the solution of a macroscopic homogenized Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
