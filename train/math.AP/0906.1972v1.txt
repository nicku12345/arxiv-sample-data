In this note we give a shorter proof of recent regularity results by Riviere and Riviere-Struwe. We differ from the mentioned articles only in using the direct method of Helein's moving frame to construct a suitable gauge transformation. Though this is neither new nor surprising, it enables us to describe a proof of regularity using besides the duality of Hardy- and BMO-space only elementary arguments of calculus of variations and algebraic identities. Moreover, we remark that in order to prove Hildebrandt's conjecture one can avoid the Nash-Moser imbedding theorem. There are no new results presented here, nor are there any techniques we could claim originality for.
