In this paper we study the maximal regularity property for non-autonomous evolution equations \partial_t u(t)+A(t)u(t)=f(t), u(0)=0. If the equation is considered on a Hilbert space H and the operators A(t) are defined by sesquilinear forms  a(t,.,.) we prove the maximal regularity under a Holder continuity assumption of t \to a(t,.,.). In the non-Hilbert space situation we focus on Schrodinger type operators A(t):= -\Delta + m(t, .) and prove L^p-L^q estimates for a wide class of time and space dependent potentials m.
