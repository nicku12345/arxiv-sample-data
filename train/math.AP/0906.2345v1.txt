We consider the 2m-th order elliptic boundary value problem Lu=f(x,u) on a bounded smooth domain \Omega\subset\R^N with Dirichlet boundary conditions on \partial\Omega. The operator L is a uniformly elliptic linear operator of order 2m whose principle part is of the form \big(-\sum_{i,j=1}^N a_{ij}(x) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}\big)^m. We assume that f is superlinear at the origin and satisfies \lim \limits_{s\to\infty}\frac{f(x,s)}{s^q}=h(x), \lim \limits_{s\to-\infty}\frac{f(x,s)}{|s|^q}=k(x), where h,k\in C(\overline{\Omega}) are positive functions and q>1 is subcritical. By combining degree theory with new and recently established a priori estimates, we prove the existence of a nontrivial solution.
