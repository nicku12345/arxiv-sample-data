The object of this paper is twofold: In the first part, we unify and extend the recent developments on honesty theory of perturbed substochastic semigroups (on L^{1}(\mu)-spaces or noncommutative L^{1} spaces) to general state spaces; this allows us to capture for instance a honesty theory in preduals of abstract von Neumann algebras or subspaces of duals of abstract C^{\ast }-algebras. In the second part of the paper, we provide another honesty theory (a semigroup-perturbation approach) independent of the previous resolvent-perturbation approach and show the equivalence of the two approaches. This second viewpoint on honesty is new even in L^{1}(\mu) spaces. Several fine properties of Dyson-Phillips expansions are given and a classical generation theorem by T. Kato is revisited.
