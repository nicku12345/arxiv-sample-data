Let d \geq 3. We consider the global Cauchy problem for the generalised Navier-Stokes system \partial_t u + (u \cdot \nabla) u &= - D^2 u - \nabla p \nabla \cdot u &= 0 u(0,x) &= u_0(x) for u: \R^+ \times \R^d \to \R^d and p: \R^+ \times \R^d \to \R, where u_0: \R^d \to \R^d is smooth and divergence free, and D is a Fourier multiplier whose symbol m: \R^d \to \R^+ is non-negative; the case m(\xi) = |\xi| is essentially Navier-Stokes. It is folklore (see e.g. \cite{kp}) that one has global regularity in the critical and subcritical hyperdissipation regimes m(\xi) = |\xi|^\alpha for \alpha \geq \frac{d+2}{4}. We improve this slightly by establishing global regularity under the slightly weaker condition that m(\xi) \geq |\xi|^{(d+2)/4}/g(|\xi|) for all sufficiently large \xi and some non-decreasing function g: \R^+ \to \R^+ such that \int_1^\infty \frac{ds}{sg(s)^4} = +\infty. In particular, the results apply for the logarithmically supercritical dissipation m(\xi) := |\xi|^{\frac{d+2}{4}} / \log(2 + |\xi|)^{1/4}.
