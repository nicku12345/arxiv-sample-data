This paper is devoted to the study of a coupled system consisting in a wave and heat equations coupled through transmission condition along a steady interface. This system is a linearized model for fluid-structure interaction introduced by Rauch, Zhang and Zuazua for a simple transmission condition and by Zhang and Zuazua for a natural transmission condition. Using an abstract Theorem of Burq and a new Carleman estimate shown near the interface, we complete the results obtained by Zhang and Zuazua and by Duyckaerts. We show, without any geometric restriction, a logarithmic decay result.
