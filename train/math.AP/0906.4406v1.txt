The purpose of this article is to clarify the Cauchy theory of the water waves equations as well in terms of regularity indexes for the initial conditions as for the smoothness of the bottom of the domain (namely no regularity assumption is assumed on the bottom). Our main result is that, following the approach developped by T. Alazard and G. M\'etivier in [1], after suitable paralinearizations, the system can be arranged into an explicit symmetric system of Schr\"odinger type. We then show that the smoothing effect for the (one dimensional) surface tension water waves proved by H. Christianson, V. M. Hur, and G. Staffilani in [9], is in fact a rather direct consequence of this reduction, which allows also to lower the regularity indexes of the initial data, and to obtain the natural weights in the estimates.
