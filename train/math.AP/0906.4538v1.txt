We investigate the one-dimensional Keller-Segel model where the diffusion is replaced by a non-local operator, namely the fractional diffusion with exponent 0<\alpha\leq 2. We prove some features related to the classical two-dimensional Keller-Segel system: blow-up may or may not occur depending on the initial data. More precisely a singularity appears in finite time when \alpha<1 and the initial configuration of cells is sufficiently concentrated. On the opposite, global existence holds true for \alpha\leq1 if the initial density is small enough in the sense of the L^{1/\alpha} norm.
