The aim of this work is to prove by a perturbation method the existence of solutions of the coupled Einstein-Dirac equations for a static, spherically symmetric system of two fermions in a singlet spinor state. We relate the solutions of our equations to those of the nonlinear Choquard equation and we show that the nondegenerate solution of Choquard's equation generates solutions for Einstein-Dirac equations.
