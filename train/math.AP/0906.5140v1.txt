In this paper, we prove the well-posedness for the fractional Navier-Stokes equations in critical spaces G^{-(2\beta-1)}_{n}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) and BMO^{-(2\beta-1)}(\mathbb{R}^{n}). Both of them are close to the largest critical space \dot{B}^{-(2\beta-1)}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n}). In G^{-(2\beta-1)}_{n}(\mathbb{R}^{n}), we establish the well-posedness based on a priori estimates for the fractional Navier-Stokes equations in Besov spaces. To obtain the well-posedness in BMO^{-(2\beta-1)}(\mathbb{R}^{n}), we find a relationship between Q_{\alpha;\infty}^{\beta,-1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) and BMO(\mathbb{R}^{n}) by giving an equivalent characterization of BMO^{-\zeta}(\mathbb{R}^{n}).
