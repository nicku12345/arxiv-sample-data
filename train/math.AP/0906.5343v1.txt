We show existence of global solutions for the gravity water waves equation in dimension 3, in the case of small data. The proof combines energy estimates, which yield control of L^2 related norms, with dispersive estimates, which give decay in L^\infty. To obtain these dispersive estimates, we use an analysis in Fourier space; the study of space and time resonances is then the crucial point.
