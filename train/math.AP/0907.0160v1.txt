By virtue of a weak comparison principle in small domains we prove axial symmetry in convex and symmetric smooth bounded domains as well as radial symmetry in balls for regular solutions of a class of quasi-linear elliptic systems in non-variational form. Moreover, in the two dimensional case, we study the system when set in a half-space.
