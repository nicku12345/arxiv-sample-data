It is shown that u_k \cdot v_k converges weakly to u\cdot v if u_k\weakto u weakly in L^p and v_k\weakly v weakly in L^q with p, q\in (1,\infty), 1/p+1/q=1, under the additional assumptions that the sequences \Div u_k and \curl v_k are compact in the dual space of W^{1,\infty}_0 and that u_k\cdot v_k is equi-integrable. The main point is that we only require equi-integrability of the scalar product u_k\cdot v_k and not of the individual sequences.
