In this paper we study the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations on a smooth, bounded domain \Omega \subset \Rn{2}, subject to an electrical current applied on the boundary. The dynamics with an applied current are non-dissipative, but via the identification of a special structure in an interaction energy, we are able to derive a precise upper bound for the energy growth. We then turn to the study of the dynamics of the vortices of the solutions in the limit \ep \to 0. We first consider the original time scale, in which the vortices do not move and the solutions undergo a "phase relaxation." Then we study an accelerated time scale in which the vortices move according to a derived dynamical law. In the dynamical law, we identify a novel Lorentz force term induced by the applied boundary current.
