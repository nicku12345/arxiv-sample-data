We study the generalized boundary value problem for nonnegative solutions of -\Delta u+g(u)=0 in a bounded Lipschitz domain \Gw, when g is continuous and nondecreasing. Using the harmonic measure of \Gw, we define a trace in the class of outer regular Borel measures. We amphasize the case where g(u)=|u|^{q-1}u, q>1. When \Gw is (locally) a cone with vertex y, we prove sharp results of removability and characterization of singular behavior. In the general case, assuming that \Gw possesses a tangent cone at every boundary point and q is subcritical, we prove an existence and uniqueness result for positive solutions with arbitrary boundary trace. We obtain sharp results involving Besov spaces with negative index on k-dimensional edges and apply our results to the characterization of removable sets and good measures on the boundary of a polyhedron.
