We prove that the critical points of the 3d nonlinear elasticity functional on shells of small thickness h and around the mid-surface S of arbitrary geometry, converge as h\to 0 to the critical points of the von K\'arm\'an functional on S, recently derived in \cite{lemopa1}. This result extends the statement in \cite{MuPa}, derived for the case of plates when S\subset\mathbb{R}^2. We further prove the same convergence result for the weak solutions to the static equilibrium equations (formally the Euler- Lagrange equations associated to the elasticity functional). The convergences hold provided the elastic energy of the 3d deformations scale like h^4 and the external body forces scale like h^3.
