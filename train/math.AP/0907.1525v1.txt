Using a weighted H^s-contraction mapping argument based on the macro-micro decomposition of Liu and Yu, we give an elementary proof of existence, with sharp rates of decay and distance from the Chapman--Enskog approximation, of small-amplitude shock profiles of the Boltzmann equation with hard-sphere potential, recovering and slightly sharpening results obtained by Caflisch and Nicolaenko using different techniques. A key technical point in both analyses is that the linearized collision operator L is negative definite on its range, not only in the standard square-root Maxwellian weighted norm for which it is self-adjoint, but also in norms with nearby weights. Exploring this issue further, we show that L is negative definite on its range in a much wider class of norms including norms with weights asymptotic nearly to a full Maxwellian rather than its square root. This yields sharp localization in velocity at near-Maxwellian rate, rather than the square-root rate obtained in previous analyses
