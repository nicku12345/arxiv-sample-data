We summarize some recent results of the authors and their collaborators, regarding the derivation of thin elastic shell models (for shells with mid-surface of arbitrary geometry) from the variational theory of 3d nonlinear elasticity. We also formulate a conjecture on the form and validity of infinitely many limiting 2d models, each corresponding to its proper scaling range of the body forces in terms of the shell thickness.
