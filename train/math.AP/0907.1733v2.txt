We consider an initial boundary value problem for a 2x2 system of conservation laws modeling heatless adsorption of a gaseous mixture with two species and instantaneous exchange kinetics, close to the system of Chromatography. In this model the velocity is not constant because the sorption effect is taken into account. Exchanging the roles of the x, t variables we obtain a strictly hyperbolic system with a zero eigenvalue. Our aim is to construct a solution with a velocity which blows up at the corresponding characteristic "hyperbolic boundary" {t = 0}.
