The goal of this note is to state the optimal decay rate for solutions of the nonlinear fast diffusion equation and, in self-similar variables, the optimal convergence rates to Barenblatt self-similar profiles and their generalizations. It relies on the identification of the optimal constants in some related Hardy-Poincar\'e inequalities and concludes a long series of papers devoted to generalized entropies, functional inequalities and rates for nonlinear diffusion equations.
