We consider the elliptic equation -\Delta u = f(u) in the whole \R^{2m}, where f is of bistable type. It is known that there exists a saddle-shaped solution in \R^{2m}. This is a solution which changes sign in \R^{2m} and vanishes only on the Simons cone {\mathcal C}=\{(x^1,x^2)\in\R^m\times\R^m: |x^1|=|x^2|\}. It is also known that these solutions are unstable in dimensions 2 and 4.   In this article we establish that when 2m=6 every saddle-shaped solution is unstable outside of every compact set and, as a consequence has infinite Morse index. For this we establish the asymptotic behavior of saddle-shaped solutions at infinity. Moreover we prove the existence of a minimal and a maximal saddle-shaped solutions and derive monotonicity properties for the maximal solution.   These results are relevant in connection with a conjecture of De Giorgi on 1D symmetry of certain solutions. Saddle-shaped solutions are the simplest candidates, besides 1D solutions, to be global minimizers in high dimensions, a property not yet established.
