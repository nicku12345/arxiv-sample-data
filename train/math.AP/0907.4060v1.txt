The present paper is devoted to the study of the well-posedness issue for the density-dependent Euler equations in the whole space. We establish local-in-time results for the Cauchy problem pertaining to data in the Besov spaces embedded in the set of Lipschitz functions, including the borderline case B^{\frac Np+1}_{p,1}(\R^N). A continuation criterion in the spirit of the celebrated one by Beale-Kato-Majda for the classical Euler equations, is also proved. In contrast with the previous work dedicated to this system in the whole space, our approach is not restricted to the L^2 framework or to small perturbations of a constant density state: we just need the density to be bounded away from zero. The key to that improvement is a new a priori estimate in Besov spaces for an elliptic equation with nonconstant coefficients.
