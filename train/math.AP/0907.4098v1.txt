We consider the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations i\partial_t u+\Delta u +u|u|^{p-1}=0 in dimension 1\leq N\leq 5 and for slightly L^2 supercritical nonlinearities p_c<p<(1+\e)p_c with p_c=1+\frac{4}{N} and 0<\e\ll 1. We prove the existence and stability in the energy space H^1 of a self similar finite time blow up dynamics and provide a qualitative description of the singularity formation near the blow up time
