In this article we prove weighted norm inequalities and pointwise estimates between the multilinear fractional integral operator and the multilinear fractional maximal. As a consequence of these estimations we obtain weighted weak and strong inequalities for the multilinear fractional integral operator. In particular, we extend some results given in \cite{CPSS} to the multilinear context. On the other hand we prove weighted pointwise estimates between the multilinear fractional maximal operator {\cal M}_{\alpha,B} associated to a Young function B and the multilinear maximal operators {\cal M}_{\psi}={\cal M}_{0,\psi}, \psi(t)=B(t^{1-\alpha/(nm)})^{{nm}/{(nm-\alpha)}}. As an application of these estimate we obtain a direct proof of the L^p-L^q boundedness results of {\cal M}_{\alpha,B} for the case B(t)=t and B_k(t)=t(1+\log^+t)^k when 1/q=1/p-\alpha/n. We also give sufficient conditions on the weights involved in the boundedness results of {\cal M}_{\alpha,B} that generalizes those given in \cite{M} for B(t)=t. Finally, we prove some boundedness results in Banach function spaces for a generalized version of the multilinear fractional maximal operator.
