We study the Gross-Pitaevskii equation involving a nonlocal interaction potential. Our aim is to give sufficient conditions that cover a variety of nonlocal interactions such that the associated Cauchy problem is globally well-posed with non-zero boundary condition at infinity, in any dimension. We focus on even potentials that are positive definite or positive tempered distributions.
