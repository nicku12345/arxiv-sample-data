In this paper the regularity of weak solutions and the blow-up criteria of smooth solutions to the micropolar fluid equations on three dimension space are studied in the Lorentz space L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3). We obtain that if u\in L^q(0,T;L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)) for \frac2q+\frac3p\le 1 with 3<p\le \infty; or \nabla u\in L^q(0,T;L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)) for \frac2q+\frac3p\le 2 with \frac32<p\le \infty; or the pressure P\in L^q(0,T;L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)) for \frac2q+\frac3p\le 2 with \frac32<p\le \infty; or \nabla P\in L^q(0,T;L^{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)) for \frac2q+\frac3p\le 3 with 1<p\le \infty, then the weak solution (u,\omega) satisfying the energy inequality is a smooth solution on [0,T).
