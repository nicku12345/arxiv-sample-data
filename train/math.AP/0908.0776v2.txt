This is the final paper in the series \cite{tao:heatwave}, \cite{tao:heatwave2}, \cite{tao:heatwave3}, \cite{tao:heatwave4} that establishes global regularity for two-dimensional wave maps into hyperbolic targets. In this paper we establish the remaining claims required for this statement, namely a divisible perturbation theory, and a means of synthesising solutions for frequency-delocalised, spatially-dispersed, or spatially-delocalised data out of solutions of strictly smaller energy.   As a consequence of the perturbation theory here and the results obtained earlier in the series, we also establish spacetime bounds and scattering properties of wave maps into hyperbolic space.
