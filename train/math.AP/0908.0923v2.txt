Recently, using DiGiorgi-type techniques, Caffarelli and Vasseur showed that a certain class of weak solutions to the drift diffusion equation with initial data in L^2 gain H\"older continuity provided that the BMO norm of the drift velocity is bounded uniformly in time. We show a related result: a uniform bound on BMO norm of a smooth velocity implies uniform bound on the C^\beta norm of the solution for some \beta >0. We use elementary tools involving control of H\"older norms using test functions. In particular, our approach offers a third proof of the global regularity for the critical surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation.
