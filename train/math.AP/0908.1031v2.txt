We consider Stokes' conjecture concerning the shape of the extremal two-dimensional water wave. By new geometric methods including a nonlinear frequency formula, we prove Stokes' conjecture in the original variables. Our results do not rely on structural assumptions needed in previous results such as isolated singularities, symmetry and monotonicity. Part of our results extends to the mathematical problem in higher dimensions.
