We obtain upper bounds for the quenching time of the solutions of the nonlocal parabolic MEMS equation u_t=\Delta u+\lam/(1-u)^2(1+\chi\int_{\Omega}1/(1-u) dx)^2 in \Omega\times (0,\infty), u=0 on \1\Omega\times (0,\infty), u(x,0)=u_0 in \Omega, when \lambda is large. We prove the compactness of the quenching set under a mild condition on the initial data. When \Omega=B_R and u_0 is radially symmetric and monotone decreasing in 0\le r\le R, we prove that the point x=0 is the only possible quenching set. When u_0 also satisfies some strict concavity assumption, we prove that for any \beta\in (2,3) the solution satisfies 1-u(x,t)\ge C|x|^{\frac{2}{\beta}} for some constant C>0 and we also obtain the quenching time estimate in this case.
