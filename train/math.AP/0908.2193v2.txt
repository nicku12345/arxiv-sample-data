We study the traveling wave solutions to a reaction diffusion system modeling the public goods game with altruistic behaviors. The existence of the waves is derived through monotone iteration of a pair of classical upper- and lower solutions. The waves are shown to be unique and strictly monotonic. A similar KPP wave like asymptotic behaviors are obtained by comparison principle and exponential dichotomy. The stability of the traveling waves with non-critical speed is investigate by spectral analysis in the weighted Banach spaces.
