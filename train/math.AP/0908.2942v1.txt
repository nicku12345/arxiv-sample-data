Consider a family of bounded domains \Omega_{t} in the plane (or more generally any Euclidean space) that depend analytically on the parameter t, and consider the ordinary Neumann Laplacian \Delta_{t} on each of them. Then we can organize all the eigenfunctions into continuous families u_{t}^{(j)} with eigenvalues \lambda_{t}^{(j)} also varying continuously with t, although the relative sizes of the eigenvalues will change with t at crossings where \lambda_{t}^{(j)}=\lambda_{t}^{(k)}. We call these families homotopies of eigenfunctions. We study two explicit examples. The first example has \Omega_{0} equal to a square and \Omega_{1} equal to a circle; in both cases the eigenfunctions are known explicitly, so our homotopies connect these two explicit families. In the second example we approximate the Sierpinski carpet starting with a square, and we continuously delete subsquares of varying sizes. (Data available in full at www.math.cornell.edu/~smh82)
