We prove the existence of solutions for the singularly perturbed Schr\"odinger--Newton system   {ll}   \hbar^2 \Delta \psi - V(x) \psi + U \psi =0   \hbar^2 \Delta U + 4\pi \gamma |\psi|^2 =0 . \hbox{in \mathbb{R}^3} with an electric potential (V) that decays polynomially fast at infinity. The solution \psi concentrates, as \hbar \to 0, around (structurally stable) critical points of the electric potential. As a particular case, isolated strict extrema of (V) are allowed.
