The existence of proper weak solutions of the Dirichlet-Cauchy problem constituted by the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system which characterizes the incompressible homogeneous Newtonian fluids under thermal effects is studied. We call proper weak solutions such weak solutions that verify some local energy inequalities in analogy with the suitable weak solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, we deal with some regularity for the temperature.
