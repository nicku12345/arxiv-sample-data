This paper is concerned with the analysis of blow-up solutions to the elliptic-elliptic Davey-Stewartson system, which appears in the description of the evolution of surface water waves. We prove a mass concentration property for H^{1}-solutions, analogous to the one known for the L^{2}-critical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We also prove a mass concentration result for L^{2}-solutions.
