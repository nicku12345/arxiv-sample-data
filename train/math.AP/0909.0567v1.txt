Let H be the symmetric second-order differential operator on L_2(\Ri) with domain C_c^\infty(\Ri) and action H\varphi=-(c \varphi')' where  c\in W^{1,2}_{\rm loc}(\Ri) is a real function which is strictly positive on \Ri\backslash\{0\} but with c(0)=0. We give a complete characterization of the self-adjoint extensions and the submarkovian extensions of H. In particular if \nu=\nu_+\vee\nu_- where \nu_\pm(x)=\pm\int^{\pm 1}_{\pm x} c^{-1} then H has a unique self-adjoint extension if and only if \nu\not\in L_2(0,1) and a unique submarkovian extension if and only if \nu\not\in L_\infty(0,1). In both cases the corresponding semigroup leaves L_2(0,\infty) and L_2(-\infty,0) invariant.   In addition we prove that for a general non-negative  c\in W^{1,\infty}_{\rm loc}(\Ri) the corresponding operator H has a unique submarkovian extension.
