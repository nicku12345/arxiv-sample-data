This paper is concerned with some nonlinear propagation phenomena for reaction-advection-diffusion equations in a periodic framework. It deals with travelling wave solutions of the equation u_t =\nabla\cdot(A(z)\nabla u) +q(z)\cdot\nabla u+ f(z,u), t \in \mathbb{R}, z \in \Omega, propagating with a speed c. In the case of a "combustion" nonlinearity, the speed c exists and it is unique, while the front u is unique up to a translation in t. We give a \min-\max and a \max-\min formula for this speed c. On the other hand, in the case of a "ZFK" or a "KPP" nonlinearity, there exists a minimal speed of propagation c^{*}. In this situation, we give a \min-\max formula for c^{*}. Finally, we apply this \min-\max formula to prove a variational formula involving eigenvalue problems for the minimal speed c^{*} in the "KPP" case.
