Large deviation estimates for the following linear parabolic equation are studied: \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\tr\Big(a(x)D^2u\Big) + b(x)\cdot D u + \int_{\R^N} \Big\{(u(x+y)-u(x)-(D u(x)\cdot y)\ind{|y|<1}(y)\Big\}\d\mu(y), \] where \mu is a L\'evy measure (which may be singular at the origin). Assuming only that some negative exponential integrates with respect to the tail of \mu, it is shown that given an initial data, solutions defined in a bounded domain converge exponentially fast to the solution of the problem defined in the whole space. The exact rate, which depends strongly on the decay of \mu at infinity, is also estimated.
