In this paper we give a proof of the existence of global regular solutions to the Fourier transformed Navier-Stokes system with small initial data in \Phi(2) via an iteration argument. The proof of the regularity theorem is a minor modification of the proof given in the paper "Some elementary estimates for the Navier-Stokes system". So this paper is intended to be just a complement to the afore mentioned paper.
