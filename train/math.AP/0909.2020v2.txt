Studied here is the generalized Benjamin-Ono--Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation u_t+u^pu_x+\alpha\mathscr{H}u_{xx}+\varepsilon u_{xyy}=0, \quad (x,y)\in\rr^2\!,\;\;t\in \rr^+\! in two space dimensions. Here, \mathscr{H} is the Hilbert transform and subscripts denote partial differentiation. We classify when equation (1) possesses solitary-wave solutions in terms of the signs of the constants \alpha and \varepsilon appearing in the dispersive terms and the strength of the nonlinearity. Regularity and decay properties of these solitary wave are determined and their stability is studied.
