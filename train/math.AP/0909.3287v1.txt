We prove unique continuation properties for solutions of evolution Schr\"odinger equation with time dependent potentials. In the case of the free solution these correspond to uncertainly principles referred to as being of Morgan type. As an application of our method we also obtain results concerning the possible concentration profiles of solutions of semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations.
