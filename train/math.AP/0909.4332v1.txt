In this paper, we consider the global well-posedness of the defocusing, L^{2} - critical nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation in dimensions n \geq 3. Using the I-method, we show the problem is globally well-posed in n = 3 when s > {2/5}, and when n \geq 4, for s > \frac{n - 2}{n}. We combine energy increments for the I-method, interaction Morawetz estimates, and almost Morawetz estimates to prove the result.
