We consider the class of semi-stable solutions to semilinear equations -\Delta u=f(u) in a bounded smooth domain \Omega of R^n (with \Omega convex in some results). This class includes all local minimizers, minimal, and extremal solutions. In dimensions n \leq 4, we establish an priori L^\infty bound which holds for every positive semi-stable solution and every nonlinearity f. This estimate leads to the boundedness of all extremal solutions when n=4 and \Omega is convex. This result was previously known only in dimensions n\leq 3 by a result of G. Nedev. In dimensions 5 \leq n \leq 9 the boundedness of all extremal solutions remains an open question. It is only known to hold in the radial case \Omega=B_R by a result of A. Capella and the author.
