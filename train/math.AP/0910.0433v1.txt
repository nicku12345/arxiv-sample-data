We study long time existence for high dimensional quasilinear wave equations exterior to star-shaped obstacles. In particular, we obtain exterior domain analogs of the four dimensional results of H\"ormander where the nonlinearity is permitted to depend on the solution not just its first and second derivatives. Previous proofs in exterior domains omitted this dependence as it did not mesh well with the energy methods in use.
