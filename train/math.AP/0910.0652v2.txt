We introduce a family {\cal F} of normal Tricomi domains \Om_{\a,\b}, \a>0>\b, and we show that its elements are D-star-shaped with respect to the vector field D=-3x\partial_x-2y\partial_y if and only if \a\ge1/2. Provided that the underlying domain \Om belongs to {\cal F} for some \a\ge1/2, we then establish L^2 estimates for the eigenfunctions corresponding to real eigenvalues of the Tricomi operator. In particular, our result highlights a dependency of these estimates on the values of \a and \b and the parabolic diameter of \Om.
