Let S^2 be the 2-dimensional unit sphere and let J_\alpha  denote the nonlinear functional on the Sobolev space H^{1,2}(S^2) defined by  J_\alpha(u) = \frac{\alpha}{4}\int_{S^2}|\nabla u|^2 d\omega + \int_{S^2} u d\omega -\ln \int_{S^2} e^{u} d\omega,  where d\omega denotes Lebesgue measure on S^2, normalized so that \int_{S^2} d\omega = 1. Onofri had established that J_\alpha is non-negative on H^1(S^2) provided \alpha \geq 1. In this note, we show that if J_\alpha is restricted to those u\in H^1(S^2) that satisfy the Aubin condition: \int_{S^2}e^u x_j dw=0\quad\text{for all}1\leq j\leq 3, then the same inequality continues to hold (i.e., J_\alpha (u)\geq0) whenever \alpha \geq {2/3}-\epsilon_0 for some \epsilon_0>0. The question of Chang-Yang on whether this remains true for all \alpha \geq {1/2} remains open.
