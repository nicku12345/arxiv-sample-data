In this remark, we give another approach to the local well-posedness of quadratic Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinearity u\bar u in H^{-1/4}, which was already proved by Kishimoto \cite{kis}. Our resolution space is l^1-analogue of X^{s,b} space with low frequency part in a weaker space L^{\infty}_{t}L^2_x. Such type spaces was developed by Guo. \cite{G} to deal the KdV endpoint H^{-3/4} regularity.
