In this paper, we consider the following modified quasi-geostrophic equations \partial_t\theta +\Lambda^\alpha\theta +u\vec\nabla\theta =0, u=\Lambda ^{\alpha-1}\mathcal{R}^\perp(\theta) where \alpha \in ]0,1[ is a fixed parameter. This equation was recently introduced by P. Constantin, G. Iyer and J. Wu in \cite{CIW} as a modification of the classical quasi-geostrophic equation. In this paper, we prove that for any initial data \theta_\ast in the Sobolev space H^1(\mathbb{R}^2), the equation (MQG) has a global and smooth solution \theta  in C(\mathbb{R}^{+},H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)) .
