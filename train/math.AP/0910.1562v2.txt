We establish a new type of local asymptotic formula for the Green's function {\mathcal G}_t(x,y) of a uniformly parabolic linear operator \partial_t - L with non-constant coefficients using dilations and Taylor expansions at a point z=z(x,y), for a function z with bounded derivatives such that z(x,x)=x \in {\mathbb R}^N. For z(x,y) =x, we recover the known, classical expansion obtained via pseudo-differential calculus. Our method is based on dilation at z, Dyson and Taylor series expansions, and the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff commutator formula. Our procedure leads to an elementary, algorithmic construction of approximate solutions to parabolic equations which are accurate to arbitrary prescribed order in the short-time limit. We establish mapping properties and precise error estimates in the exponentially weighted, L^{p}-type Sobolev spaces W^{s,p}_a({\mathbb R}^N) that appear in practice.
