The free-boundary compressible 1-D Euler equations with moving physical vacuum boundary are a system of hyperbolic conservation laws which are both characteristic and degenerate. The physical vacuum singularity (or rate-of-degeneracy) requires the sound speed c= \gamma \rho^{\gamma -1} to scale as the square-root of the distance to the vacuum boundary, and has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. We establish the existence of unique solutions to this system on a short time-interval, which are smooth (in Sobolev spaces) all the way to the moving boundary. The proof is founded on a new higher-order Hardy-type inequality in conjunction with an approximation of the Euler equations consisting of a particular degenerate parabolic regularization. Our regular solutions can be viewed as degenerate viscosity solutions.
