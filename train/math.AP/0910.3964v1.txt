In this paper, we prove global well-posedness for low regularity data for the one dimensional quintic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We show that a unique solution exists for u_{0} \in H^{s}(\mathbf{R}), s > {8/29}. This improves the result in [13], which proved global well-posedness for s > {1/3}. The main new argument is that we obtain almost Morawetz estimates with improved error.
