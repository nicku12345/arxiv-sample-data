In this paper we consider the initial value problem of the Benjamin equation  \partial_{t}u+\nu \H(\partial^2_xu)   +\mu\partial_{x}^{3}u+\partial_xu^2=0,  where u:\R\times [0,T]\mapsto \R, and the constants \nu,\mu\in \R,\mu\neq0. We use the I-method to show that it is globally well-posed in Sobolev spaces H^s(\R) for s>-3/4. Moreover, we use some argument to obtain a good estimative for the lifetime of the local solution, and employ some multiplier decomposition argument to construct the almost conserved quantities.
