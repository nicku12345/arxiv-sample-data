We study the initial value problem of the quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation  iu_t+u_{xx}=u\bar{u},  where u:\R\times \R\to \C. We prove that it's locally well-posed in H^s(\R) when s\geq -\dfrac{1}{4} and ill-posed when s< -\dfrac{1}{4}, which improve the previous work in \cite{KPV}. Moreover, we consider the problem in the following space,  H^{s,a}(\R)={u:\|u\|_{H^{s,a}}\triangleq (\displaystyle\int (|\xi|^s\chi_{\{|\xi|>1\}}+|\xi|^a\chi_{\{|\xi|\leq 1\}})^2|\hat{u}(\xi)|^2 d\xi)^{{1/2}}<\infty}  for s\leq 0, a\geq 0. We establish the local well-posedness in H^{s,a}(\R) when s\geq -\dfrac{1}{4}-\dfrac{1}{2}a and a<\dfrac{1}{2}. Also we prove that it's ill-posed in H^{s,a}(\R) when s<-\dfrac{1}{4}-\dfrac{1}{2}a or a>\dfrac{1}{2}. It remains the cases on the line segment: a=\dfrac{1}{2}, -\dfrac{1}{2}\leq s\leq 0 open in this paper.
