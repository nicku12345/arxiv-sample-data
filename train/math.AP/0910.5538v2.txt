We prove the asymptotic stability of the moving kinks for the nonlinear relativistic wave equations in one space dimension with a Ginzburg-Landau potential: starting in a small neighborhood of the kink, the solution, asymptotically in time, is the sum of a uniformly moving kink and dispersive part described by the free Klein-Gordon equation. The remainder decays in a global energy norm. Crucial role in the proofs play our recent results on the weighted energy decay for the Klein-Gordon equations.
