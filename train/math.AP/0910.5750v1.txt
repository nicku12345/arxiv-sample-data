Let \Phi be a real valued function of one real variable, let L denote an elliptic second order formally self-adjoint differential operator with bounded measurable coefficients, and let P stand for the Poisson operator for L. A necessary and sufficient condition on \Phi ensuring the equivalence of the Dirichlet integrals of \Phi\circ Ph and P(\Phi\circ h) is obtained. We illustrate this result by some sharp inequalities for harmonic functions.
