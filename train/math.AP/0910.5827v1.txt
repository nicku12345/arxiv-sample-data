In this paper we prove existence of ground state solutions of the modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation:  -\Delta u+V(x)u-{1/2}u \Delta u^{2}=|u|^{p-1}u, x \in \R^N, N \geq 3,  under some hypotheses on V(x). This model has been proposed in the theory of superfluid films in plasma physics. As a main novelty with respect to some previous results, we are able to deal with exponents p\in(1,3). The proof is accomplished by minimization under a convenient constraint.
