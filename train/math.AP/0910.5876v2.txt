In two dimensions every weak solution to a nonlinear elliptic system \rm{div} a(x,u,Du)=0 has H\"older continuous first derivatives provided that standard continuity, ellipticity and growth assumptions hold with a growth exponent p \geq 2. We give an example showing that this result cannot be extended to the subquadratic case, i.e. that weak solutions are not necessarily continuous if 1< p <2. Furthermore, we discuss related results for variational integrals.
