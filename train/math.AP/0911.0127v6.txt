We prove scattering of \tilde{H}^{k}  solutions of the loglog energy-supercritical Schrodinger equation i \partial_{t} u + \triangle u = |u|^{\frac{4}{n-2}} u \log^{c} {(\log{(10+|u|^{2})})}, 0 < c < c_{n}, n={3,4}, with radial data u(0):=u_{0} \in \tilde{H}^{k} , k>n/2. This is achieved, roughly speaking, by extending Bourgain's argument (see also Grillakis) and Tao's argument in high dimensions.
