We consider ballistic aggregation equation for gases in which each particle is iden- ti?ed either by its mass and impulsion or by its sole impulsion. For the constant aggregation rate we prove existence of self-similar solutions as well as convergence to the self-similarity for generic solutions. For some classes of mass and/or impulsion dependent rates we are also able to estimate the large time decay of some moments of generic solutions or to build some new classes of self-similar solutions.
