In this paper, we regularize the nonlinear inverse time heat problem in the unbounded region by Fourier method. Some new convergence rates are obtained. Meanwhile, some quite sharp error estimates between the approximate solution and exact solution are provided. Especially, the optimal convergence of the approximate solution at t = 0 is also proved. This work extends to many earlier results in (f2,f3, hao1,Quan,tau1, tau2, Trong3,x1).
