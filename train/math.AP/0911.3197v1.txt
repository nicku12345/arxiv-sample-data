We prove that the Cauchy problem for the Schr\"odinger-Korteweg-de Vries system is locally well-posed for the initial data belonging to the Sovolev spaces L^2(\R)\times H^{-{3/4}}(\R). The new ingredient is that we use the \bar{F}^s type space, introduced by the first author in \cite{G}, to deal with the KdV part of the system and the coupling terms. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the lack of scaling invariance, we prove uniform estimates for the multiplier. This result improves the previous one by Corcho and Linares.
