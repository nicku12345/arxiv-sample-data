In this paper, we study the following degenerate critical elliptic equations with anisotropic coefficients  -div(|x_{N}|^{2\alpha}\nabla u)=K(x)|x_{N}|^{\alpha\cdot 2^{*}(s)-s}|u|^{2^{*}(s)-2}u {in} \mathbb{R}^{N}  where x=(x_{1},...,x_{N})\in\mathbb{R}^{N}, N\geq 3, \alpha>1/2, 0\leq s\leq 2 and 2^{*}(s)=2(N-s)/(N-2). Some basic properties of the degenerate elliptic operator -div(|x_{N}|^{2\alpha}\nabla u) are investigated and some regularity, symmetry and uniqueness results for entire solutions of this equation are obtained. We also get some variational identities for solutions of this equation. As a consequence, we obtain some nonexistence results for solutions of this equation.
