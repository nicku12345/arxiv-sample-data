We consider solutions u to the 3d nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation i\partial_t u + \Delta u + |u|^2u=0. In particular, we are interested in finding criteria on the initial data u_0 that predict the asymptotic behavior of u(t), e.g., whether u(t) blows-up in finite time, exists globally in time but behaves like a linear solution for large times (scatters), or exists globally in time but does not scatter. This question has been resolved (at least for H^1 data) if M[u]E[u]\leq M[Q]E[Q], where M[u] and E[u] denote the mass and energy of u, and Q denotes the ground state solution to -Q+\Delta Q +|Q|^2Q=0. Here, we prove a new sufficient condition for blow-up using an interpolation type inequality and the virial identity that is applicable to certain initial data satisfying M[u]E[u]>M[Q]E[Q]. Our condition is similar to one obtained by Lushnikov (1995) but our method allows for an adaptation to radial, infinite-variance initial data that can be stated conceptually: for real initial data, if a certain fraction of the mass is contained in the unit ball, then blow-up occurs. We also show analytically (if one takes the numerically computed value of \|Q\|_{\dot H^{1/2}}) that there exist Gaussian initial data u_0 with negative quadratic phase such that \|u_0\|_{\dot H^{1/2}} < \|Q\|_{\dot H^{1/2}} but the solution u(t) blows-up. We conclude with several numerically computed examples.
