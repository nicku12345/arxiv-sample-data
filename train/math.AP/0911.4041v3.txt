In this paper we build models for short-term, mean-term and long-term dynamics of dune and megariple morphodynamics. They are models that are degenerated parabolic equations which are, moreover, singularly perturbed. We, then give an existence and uniqueness result for the short-term and mean-term models. This result is based on a time-space periodic solution existence result for degenerated parabolic equation that we set out. Finally the short-term model is homogenized.
