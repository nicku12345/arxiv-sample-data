Given a real valued function on R^n we study the problem of recovering the function from its spherical means over spheres centered on a hyperplane. An old paper of Bukhgeim and Kardakov derived an inversion formula for the odd n case with great simplicity and economy. We apply their method to derive an inversion formula for the even n case. A feature of our inversion formula, for the even n case, is that it does not require the Fourier transform of the mean values or the use of the Hilbert transform, unlike the previously known inversion formulas for the even n case. Along the way, we extend the isometry identity of Bukhgeim and Kardakov for odd n, for solutions of the wave equation, to the even n case.
