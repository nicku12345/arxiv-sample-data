This paper is concerned with the large time behavior of solutions to the Lifschitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) system of equations. Point-wise in time upper and lower bounds on the rate of coarsening are obtained for solutions with fairly general initial data. These bounds complement the time averaged upper bounds obtained by Dai and Pego, and the point-wise in time upper and lower bounds obtained by Niethammer and Velasquez for solutions with initial data close to a self-similar solution.
