We prove that the Hamilton Jacobi equation for an arbitrary Hamiltonian H (locally Lipschitz but not necessarily convex) and fractional diffusion of order one (critical) has classical C^{1,\alpha} solutions. The proof is achieved using a new H\"older estimate for solutions of advection diffusion equations of order one with bounded vector fields that are not necessarily divergence free.
