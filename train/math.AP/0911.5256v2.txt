We complete the known results on the local Cauchy problem in Sobolev spaces for the KdV-Burgers equation by proving that this equation is well-posed in  H^{-1}(\R)  with a solution-map that is analytic from H^{-1}(\R)  to C([0,T];H^{-1}(\R)) whereas it is ill-posed in  H^s(\R) , as soon as  s<-1 , in the sense that the flow-map u_0\mapsto u(t)  cannot be continuous from  H^s(\R)  to even {\cal D}'(\R)  at any fixed  t>0  small enough. As far as we know, this is the first result of this type for a dispersive-dissipative equation. The framework we develop here should be very useful to prove similar results for other dispersive-dissipative models
