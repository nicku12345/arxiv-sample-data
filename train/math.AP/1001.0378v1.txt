L^{\infty} estimates in the integrability by compensation result of H. Wente fail in dimension larger than two when Sobolev spaces are replaced by the ad-hoc Morrey spaces. However, in this paper we prove that L^{\infty} estimates hold in arbitrary dimension when Morrey spaces are replaced by their Littlewood Paley counterparts: Besov-Morrey spaces. As an application we prove the existence of conservation laws to solution of elliptic systems of the form -\Delta u= \Omega \cdot \nabla u where \Omega is antisymmetric and both \nabla u and \Omega belong to these Besov-Morrey spaces for which the system is critical.
