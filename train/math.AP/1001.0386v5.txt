We regularized the 3D Navier-Stokes equations by adding a fourth-order viscosity term. We study the upper semicontinuity, of the global attractors of the Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the regularized 3D Navier-Stokes equations, as the artificial dissipation goes to 0. We also consider applications of obtained results to the regularized problem by allowing the family of forcing functions to vary with epsilon, for epsilon >0.
