We give a new approach on general systems of the form \[(G){[c]{c}% -\Delta_{p}u=\operatorname{div}(|\nabla u| ^{p-2}\nabla u)=\epsilon_{1}|x| ^{a}u^{s}v^{\delta}, -\Delta_{q}v=\operatorname{div}(|\nabla v|^{q-2}\nabla u)=\epsilon_{2}|x|^{b}u^{\mu}v^{m},\] where Q,p,q,\delta,\mu,s,m, a,b are real parameters, Q,p,q\neq1, and \epsilon_{1}=\pm1, \epsilon_{2}=\pm1. In the radial case we reduce the problem to a quadratic system of order 4, of Kolmogorov type. Then we obtain new local and global existence or nonexistence results. In the case \epsilon_{1}=\epsilon_{2}=1, we also describe the behaviour of the ground states in two cases where the system is variational. We give an important result on existence of ground states for a nonvariational system with p=q=2 and s=m>0. In the nonradial case we solve a conjecture of nonexistence of ground states for the system with p=q=2 and \delta=m+1 and \mu=s+1.
