Regularity and uniqueness of weak solution of the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations is proven for small time in dimension N=2,3 under periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, the initial density is not required to have a positive lower bound and the pressure law is assumed to satisfy a condition that reduces to \gamma>1 when N=2,3 and P(\rho)=a\rho^{\gamma}. In a second part we prove a condition of blow-up in slightly subcritical initial data when \rho\in L^{\infty}. We finish by proving that weak solutions in \T^{N} turn out to be smooth as long as the density remains bounded in L^{\infty}(L^{(N+1+\e)\gamma}) with \e>0 arbitrary small.
