We consider the 2-dimensional focusing mass critical NLS with an inhomogeneous nonlinearity: i\partial_tu+\Delta u+k(x)|u|^{2}u=0. From standard argument, there exists a threshold M_k>0 such that H^1 solutions with \|u\|_{L^2}<M_k are global in time while a finite time blow up singularity formation may occur for \|u\|_{L^2}>M_k. In this paper, we consider the dynamics at threshold \|u_0\|_{L^2}=M_k and give a necessary and sufficient condition on k to ensure the existence of critical mass finite time blow up elements. Moreover, we give a complete classification in the energy class of the minimal finite time blow up elements at a non degenerate point, hence extending the pioneering work by Merle who treated the pseudo conformal invariant case k\equiv 1.
