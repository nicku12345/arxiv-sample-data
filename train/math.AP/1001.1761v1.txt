We consider the defocusing nonlinear wave equation u_{tt}-\Delta u + |u|^p u=0 in the energy-supercritical regime p>4. For even values of the power p, we show that blowup (or failure to scatter) must be accompanied by blowup of the critical Sobolev norm. An equivalent formulation is that solutions with bounded critical Sobolev norm are global and scatter. The impetus to consider this problem comes from recent work of Kenig and Merle who treated the case of spherically-symmetric solutions.
