In this paper, we consider the relation between p > 1 and critical dimension of the extremal solution of the semilinear equation \{\begin{array}{lllllll} \beta \Delta^{2}u-\tau \Delta u=\frac{\lambda}{(1-u)^{p}} & in\ \ B, 0<u\leq 1 & in\ \ B, u=\Delta u=0 & on\ \ \partial B, \end{array} .  where B is the unit ball in R^{n}, \lambda>0 is a parameter, \tau>0, \beta>0,p>1 are fixed constants. By Hardy-Rellich inequality, we find that when p is large enough, the critical dimension is 13.}
