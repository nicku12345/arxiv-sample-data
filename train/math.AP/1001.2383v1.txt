We develop a theory of existence, uniqueness and regularity for a porous medium equation with fractional diffusion, \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + (-\Delta)^{1/2} (|u|^{m-1}u)=0 in \mathbb{R}^N, with m>m_*=(N-1)/N, N\ge1 and f\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N). An L^1-contraction semigroup is constructed and the continuous dependence on data and exponent is established. Nonnegative solutions are proved to be continuous and strictly positive for all x\in\mathbb{R}^N, t>0.
