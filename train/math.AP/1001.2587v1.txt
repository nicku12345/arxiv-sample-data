We will investigate the asymptotic behavior of positive solutions of the elliptic equation \Delta u+|x|^{l_{1}}u^{p}+|x|^{l_{2}}u^{q}=0 {in} R^{n}. We establish that for n\geq 3 and q>p>1, any positive radial solution of (0.1) has the following property: \lim_{r\to\infty}r^{\frac{2+l_{1}}{p-1}}u and \lim_{r\to0}r^{\frac{2+l_{2}}{q-1}}u always exist if \frac{n+l_{1}}{n-2}<p<q, p\neq\frac{n+2+2l_{1}}{n-2}, q \neq\frac{n+2+2l_{2}}{n-2}. In addition, we prove that the singular solution of (0.1) is unique under a certain condition
