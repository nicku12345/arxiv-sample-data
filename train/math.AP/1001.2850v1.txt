We derive here a variant of the 2D Green-Naghdi equations that model the propagation of two-directional, nonlinear dispersive waves in shallow water. This new model has the same accuracy as the standard 2D  Green-Naghdi equations. Its mathematical interest is that it allows a control of the rotational part of the (vertically averaged) horizontal velocity, which is not the case for the usual Green-Naghdi equations. Using this property, we show that the solution of these new equations can be constructed by a standard Picard iterative scheme so that there is no loss of regularity of the solution with respect to the initial condition. Finally, we prove that the new Green-Naghdi equations conserve the almost irrotationality of the vertically averaged horizontal component of the velocity.
