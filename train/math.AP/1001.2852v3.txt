In this paper, we modified the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations by adding a l-Laplacian. We provide upper bounds on the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure the level sets of the vorticity of solutions. We express them in terms of the Kolmogorov length-scale and the Landau-Lifschitz estimates of the number of degrees of freedom in turbulent flow. We also, under certain hypothesis recover the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure estimates for the usual 3D Navier-Stokes equations with potential force. Moreover, we show that the estimates depend on l, this result suggests that the modified Navier Stokes system is successful model of turbulence and the size of the nodal set leads the way for developing the turbulence theory.
