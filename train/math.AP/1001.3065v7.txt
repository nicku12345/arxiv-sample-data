The solution of the Dirac - Klein - Gordon system in two space dimensions with Dirac data in H^s and wave data in H^{s+1/2} x H^{s-1/2} is uniquely determined in the natural solution space C^0([0,T],H^s) x C^0([0,T],H^{s+\frac1/2}), provided s > 1/30 . This improves the uniqueness part of the global well-posedness result by A. Gruenrock and the author, where uniqueness was proven in (smaller) spaces of Bourgain type. Local well-posedness is also proven for Dirac data in L^2 and wave data in H^{3/5}+} x H^{-2/5+} in the solution space C^0([0,T],L^2) x C^0([0,T],H^{3/5+}) and also for more regular data.
