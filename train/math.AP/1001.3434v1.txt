We use the theory of selfdual Lagrangians to give a variational approach to the homogenization of equations in divergence form, that are driven by a periodic family of maximal monotone vector fields. The approach has the advantage of using \Gamma-convergence methods for corresponding functionals just as in the classical case of convex potentials, as opposed to the graph convergence methods used in the absence of potentials. A new variational formulation for the homogenized equation is also given.
