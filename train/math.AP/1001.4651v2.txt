If \Omega \subset \R^n is a smooth bounded domain and q \in (0, \frac{n}{n-1}) we consider the Poincare-Sobolev inequality \[ c \Bigl(\int_{\Omega} \abs{u}^\frac{n}{n-1}\Bigr)^{1-\frac{1}{n}} \le \int_{\Omega} \abs{Du}, \] for every u \in \mathrm{BV}(\Omega) such that \int_{\Omega} \abs{u}^{q-1} u = 0. We show that the sharp constant is achieved. We also consider the same inequality on an n--dimensional compact Riemannian manifold M. When n \ge 3 and the scalar curvature is positive at some point, then the sharp constant is achieved. In the case n \ge 2, we need the maximal scalar curvature to satisfy some strict inequality.
