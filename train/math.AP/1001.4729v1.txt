We establish the uniqueness of the higher radial bound state solutions of  \Delta u +f(u)=0,\quad x\in \RR^n. \leqno(P)  We assume that the nonlinearity f\in C(-\infty,\infty) is an odd function satisfying some convexity and growth conditions, and either has one zero at b>0, is non positive and not identically 0 in (0,b), and is differentiable and positive [b,\infty), or is positive and differentiable in [0,\infty).
