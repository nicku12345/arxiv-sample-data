In general the composition of Fourier integral operators (FIOs) need not be an FIO. Motivated by the problem of linearized seismic inversion in the presence of cusp caustics for the background sound speed, we consider FIOs whose canonical relations have certain two-sided cusp degeneracies, and show that the resulting compositions have wave-front relations in the union of the diagonal and an open umbrella, the simplest type of singular Lagrangian manifold.
