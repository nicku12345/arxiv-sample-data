We study a three dimensional continuous model of gravitating matter rotating at constant angular velocity. In the rotating reference frame, by a finite dimensional reduction, we prove the existence of non radial stationary solutions whose supports are made of an arbitrarily large number of disjoint compact sets, in the low angular velocity and large scale limit. At first order, the solutions behave like point particles, thus making the link with the relative equilibria} in N-body dynamics.
