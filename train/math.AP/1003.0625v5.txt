Following our previous paper in the radial case, we consider blow-up type II solutions to the energy-critical focusing wave equation. Let W be the unique radial positive stationary solution of the equation. Up to the symmetries of the equation, under an appropriate smallness assumption, any type II blow-up solution is asymptotically a regular solution plus a rescaled Lorentz transform of W concentrating at the origin.
