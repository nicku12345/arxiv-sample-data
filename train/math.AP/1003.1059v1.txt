We prove existence of a solution for a polymer crystal growth model describing the movement of a front (\Gamma(t)) evolving with a nonlocal velocity. In this model the nonlocal velocity is linked to the solution of a heat equation with source \delta_\Gamma. The proof relies on new regularity results for the eikonal equation, in which the velocity is positive but merely measurable in time and with H\"{o}lder bounds in space. From this result, we deduce \textit{a priori} regularity for the front. On the other hand, under this regularity assumption, we prove bounds and regularity estimates for the solution of the heat equation.
