The purpose of this paper is to obtain microlocal analogues of results by L. H \"ormander about inclusion relations between the ranges of first order differential operators with coefficients in C^\infty which fail to be locally solvable. Using similar techniques, we shall study the properties of the range of classical pseudo-differential operators of principal type which fail to satisfy condition (\Psi).
