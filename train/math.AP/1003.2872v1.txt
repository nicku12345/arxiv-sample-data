We find a continuum of extinction rates for solutions u(y,\tau)\ge 0 of the fast diffusion equation u_\tau=\Delta u^m in a subrange of exponents m\in (0,1). The equation is posed in \ren for times up to the extinction time T>0. The rates take the form \|u(\cdot,\tau)\|_\infty\sim (T-\tau)^\theta \ for a whole interval of \theta>0. These extinction rates depend explicitly on the spatial decay rates of initial data.
