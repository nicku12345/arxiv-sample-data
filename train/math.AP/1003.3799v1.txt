We obtain a dispersive long-time decay in weighted energy norms for solutions of the 3D Klein-Gordon equation with generic potential. The decay extends the results obtained by Jensen and Kato for the 3D Schredinger equation. For the proof we modify the spectral approach of Jensen and Kato to make it applicable to relativistic equations.
