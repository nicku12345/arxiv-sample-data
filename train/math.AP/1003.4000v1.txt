We discuss compactness, blow-up and quantization phenomena for the prescribed Q-curvature equation (-\Delta)^m u_k=V_ke^{2mu_k} on open domains of \R{2m}. Under natural integral assumptions we show that when blow-up occurs, up to a subsequence \lim_{k\to \infty}\int_{\Omega_0} V_ke^{2mu_k}dx=L\Lambda_1, where \Omega_0\subset\subset\Omega is open and contains the blow-up points, L\in\mathbb{N} and \Lambda_1:=(2m-1)!\vol(S^{2m}) is the total Q-curvature of the round sphere S^{2m}. Moreover, under suitable assumptions, the blow-up points are isolated. We do not assume that V is positive.
