In this paper we study the asymptotic behaviour of a nonlocal nonlinear parabolic equation governed by a parameter. After giving the existence of unique branch of solutions composed by stable solutions in stationary case, we gives for the parabolic problem L^\infty  estimates of solution based on using the Moser iterations and existence of global attractor. We finish our study by the issue of asymptotic behaviour in some cases when t\to \infty.
