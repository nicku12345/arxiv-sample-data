This paper is devoted to the analysis of the classical Keller-Segel system over \mathbb{R}^d, d\geq 3. We describe as much as possible the dynamics of the system characterized by various criteria, both in the parabolic-elliptic case and in the fully parabolic case. The main results when dealing with the parabolic-elliptic case are: local existence without smallness assumption on the initial density, global existence under an improved smallness condition and comparison of blow-up criteria. A new concentration phenomenon criteria for the fully parabolic case is also given. The analysis is completed by a visualization tool based on the reduction of the parabolic-elliptic system to a finite-dimensional dynamical system of gradient flow type, sharing features similar to the infinite-dimensional system.
