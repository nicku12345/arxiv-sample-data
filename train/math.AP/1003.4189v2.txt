In this article we study the positive solutions of the parabolic semilinear system of competitive type \[ \left\{\begin{array} [c]{c}% u_{t}-\Delta u+v^{p}=0, v_{t}-\Delta v+u^{q}=0, \end{array} \right. \] in \Omega\times\left(0,T\right) , where \Omega is a domain of \mathbb{R}^{N}, and p,q>0, pq\neq1. Despite of the lack of comparison principles, we prove local upper estimates in the superlinear case pq>1 of the form \[ u(x,t)\leqq Ct^{-(p+1)/(pq-1)},\qquad v(x,t)\leqq Ct^{-(q+1)/(pq-1)}% \] in \omega\times\left(0,T_{1}\right) , for any domain \omega \subset\subset\Omega and T_{1}\in\left(0,T\right) , and C=C(N,p,q,T_{1}% ,\omega). For p,q>1, we prove the existence of an initial trace at time 0, which is a Borel measure on \Omega. Finally we prove that the punctual singularities at time 0 are removable when p,q\geqq1+2/N.
