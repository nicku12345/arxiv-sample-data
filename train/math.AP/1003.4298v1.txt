We show the existence and uniqueness of solutions (either local or global for small data) for an equation arising in different aspects of surface growth. Following the work of Koch and Tataru we consider spaces critical with respect to scaling and we prove our results in the largest possible critical space such that weak solutions are defined. The uniqueness of global weak solutions remains unfortunately open, unless the initial conditions are sufficiently small.
