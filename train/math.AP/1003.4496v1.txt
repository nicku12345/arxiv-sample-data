In this paper, we provide new results about an invariance of p-harmonic functions under boundary perturbations by using tug-of-war with noise; a probabilistic interpretation of p-harmonic functions introduced by Peres-Sheffield in \cite{ps}. As a main result, when E\subset\bo  is countable and f\in C(\bo), we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for E to guarantee that H_g=H_f whenever g=f on \bo\setminus E. Here H_f and H_g denote the Perron solutions of f and g. It turns out that E should be of p-harmonic measure zero with respect to \Omega. As a consequence, we analyze a structure of a countable set of p-harmonic measure zero. In particular, we give some results for the subadditivity of p-harmonic measures and an invariance result for p-harmonic measures. In addition, the results in this paper solve the problem regarding a perturbation point Bj\"orn \cite{Bjorn} suggested for the case of unweighted \R^n.
