The paper focuses on positive solutions to a coupled system of parabolic equations with nonlocal initial conditions. Such equations arise as steady-state equations in an age-structured predator-prey model with diffusion. By using global bifurcation techniques, we describe the structure of the set of positive solutions with respect to two parameters measuring the intensities of the fertility of the species. In particular, we establish co-existence steady-states, i.e. solutions which are nonnegative and nontrivial in both components.
