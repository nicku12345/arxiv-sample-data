We prove global in time existence of solutions of the Euler compressible equations for a Van der Waals gas when the density is small enough in \H{m}, for m large enough. To do so, we introduce a specific symmetrisation allowing areas of null density. Next, we make estimates in \H{m}, using for some terms the estimates done by M. Grassin, who proved the same theorem in the easier case of a perfect polytropic gas. We treat the remaining terms separately, due to their non-linearity.
