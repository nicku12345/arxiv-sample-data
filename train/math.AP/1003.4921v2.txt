In this paper we analyze the decay and the growth for large time of weak and strong solutions to the three-dimensional viscous Boussinesq system. We show that generic solutions blow up as t\to\infty in the sense that the energy and the L^p-norms of the velocity field grow to infinity for large time, for 1\le p<3. In the case of strong solutions we provide sharp estimates both from above and from below and explicit asymptotic profiles. We also show that solutions arising from (u_0,\theta_0) with zero-mean for the initial temperature \theta_0 have a special behavior as |x| or t tends to infinity: contrarily to the generic case, their energy dissipates to zero for large time.
