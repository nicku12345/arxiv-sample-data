We consider a reaction-diffusion-advection equation arising from a biological model of migrating species. The qualitative properties of the globally attracting solution are studied and in some cases the limiting profile is determined. In particular, a conjecture of Cantrell, Cosner and Lou on concentration phenomena is resolved under mild conditions. Applications to a related parabolic competition system is also discussed.
