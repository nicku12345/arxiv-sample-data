We consider Nonlinear Schrodinger type equations on S^1. In this paper, we obtain polynomial bounds on the growth in time of high Sobolev norms of their solutions. The key is to derive an iteration bound based on a frequency decomposition of the solution. This iteration bound is different than the one used earlier in the work of Bourgain, and is less dependent on the structure of the nonlinearity. We first look at the defocusing NLS equation with nonlinearity of degree \geq 5. For the quintic NLS, Bourgain derives stronger bounds using different techniques. However, our approach works for higher nonlinearities, where the techniques of Bourgain don't seem to apply. Furthermore, we study variants of the defocusing cubic NLS in which the complete integrability is broken. Among this class of equations, we consider in particular the Hartree Equation, with sufficiently regular convolution potential. For most of the equations that come from modifying the defocusing cubic NLS, we obtain better bounds than for the other equations due to the fact that we can use higher modified energies as in the work of the I-Team.
