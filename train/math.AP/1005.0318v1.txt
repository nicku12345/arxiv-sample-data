In this article we seek stability estimates in the inverse problem of determining the potential or the velocity in a wave equation in an anisotropic medium from measured Neumann boundary observations. This information is enclosed in the dynamical Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the wave equation. We prove in dimension n\geq 2 that the knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the wave equation uniquely determines the electric potential and we prove H\"older-type stability in determining the potential.
