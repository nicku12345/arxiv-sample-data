This paper concerns n\times n linear one-dimensional hyperbolic systems of the type  \partial_tu_j + a_j(x)\partial_xu_j + \sum\limits_{k=1}^nb_{jk}(x)u_k = f_j(x,t),\; j=1,...,n,  with periodicity conditions in time and reflection boundary conditions in space. We state conditions on the data a_j and b_{jk} and the reflection coefficients such that the system is Fredholm solvable. Moreover, we state conditions on the data such that for any right hand side there exists exactly one solution, that the solution survives under small perturbations of the data, and that the corresponding data-to-solution-map is smooth with respect to appropriate function space norms. In particular, those conditions imply that no small denominator effects occur.   We show that perturbations of the coefficients a_j lead to essentially different results than perturbations of the coefficients b_{jk}, in general. Our results cover cases of non-strictly hyperbolic systems as well as systems with discontinuous coefficients a_j and b_{jk}, but they are new even in the case of strict hyperbolicity and of smooth coefficients.
