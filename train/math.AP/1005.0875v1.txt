We consider a bounded connected open set \Omega \subset {\rm R}^d whose boundary \Gamma has a finite (d-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Then we define the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator D_0 on L_2(\Gamma) by form methods. The operator -D_0 is self-adjoint and generates a contractive C_0-semigroup S = (S_t)_{t > 0} on L_2(\Gamma). We show that the asymptotic behaviour of S_t as t \to \infty is related to properties of the trace of functions in H^1(\Omega) which \Omega may or may not have.
