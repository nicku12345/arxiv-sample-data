For the p-harmonic function with strictly convex level sets, we find a test function which comes from the combination of the norm of gradient of the p-harmonic function and the smallest principal curvature of the level sets of p-harmonic function. We prove that this curvature function is convex with respect to the height of the p-harmonic function. This test function is an affine function of the height when the p-harmonic function is the p-Green function on the ball. For the minimal graph, we obtain a similar results.
