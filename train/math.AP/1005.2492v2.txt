This paper is devoted to the study of time-dependent hyperbolic systems and the derivation of dispersive estimates for their solutions. It is based on a diagonalisation of the full symbol within adapted symbol classes in order to extract the essential information about representations of solutions. This is combined with a multi-dimensional van der Corput lemma to derive dispersive estimates.
