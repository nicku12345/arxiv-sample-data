In this paper we prove a quantitative form of the strong unique continuation property for the Lam\'e system when the Lam\'e coefficients \mu is Lipschitz and \lambda is essentially bounded in dimension n\ge 2. This result is an improvement of our earlier result \cite{lin5} in which both \mu and \lambda were assumed to be Lipschitz.
