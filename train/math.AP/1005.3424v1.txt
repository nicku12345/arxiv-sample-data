We give a detailed study of the infinite-energy solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in the 3D cylindrical domains in uniformly local phase space. In particular, we establish the well-posedness and dissipativity for the case of regular potentials of arbitrary polynomial growth as well as for the case of sufficiently strong singular potentials. For these cases, we prove the further regularity of solutions and the existence of a global attractor. For the cases where we have failed to prove the uniqueness (e.g., for the logarithmic potentials), we establish the existence of the trajectory attractor and study its properties.
