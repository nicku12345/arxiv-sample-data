We prove a superposition principle for Riesz potentials of nonnegative continuous functions on Lie groups of Heisenberg type. More precisely, we show that the Riesz potential  R_\alpha(\rho)(g) = \int_{\G} N(g^{-1} g')^{\alpha-Q} \rho(g') dg', \qquad 0<\alpha<Q,  of a nonnegative function \rho\in C_0(\G) on a group \G of Heisenberg type is necessarily either p-subharmonic or p-superharmonic, depending on p and \alpha. Here N denotes the non-isotropic homogeneous norm on such groups, as introduced by Kaplan. This result extends to a wide class of nonabelian stratified Lie groups a recent remarkable superposition result of Lindqvist and Manfredi.
