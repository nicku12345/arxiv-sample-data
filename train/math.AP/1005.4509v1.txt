In this paper, we generalize the Kirchhoff-Sobolev parametrix of Klainerman and Rodnianski to systems of tensor wave equations with additional first-order terms. We also present a different derivation, which better highlights that such representation formulas are supported entirely on past null cones. This generalization is a key component for extending Klainerman and Rodnianski's breakdown criterion result for Einstein-vacuum spacetimes to Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-Yang-Mills spacetimes.
