We consider a linear Schr\"odinger equation, on a bounded domain, with bilinear control, representing a quantum particle in an electric field (the control). Recently, Nersesyan proposed explicit feedback laws and proved the existence of a sequence of times (t_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} for which the values of the solution of the closed loop system converge weakly in H^2 to the ground state. Here, we prove the convergence of the whole solution, as t \rightarrow + \infty. The proof relies on control Lyapunov functions and an adaptation of the LaSalle invariance principle to PDEs.
