We prove that the KdV-Burgers is globally well-posed in  H^{-1}(\T)  with a solution-map that is analytic from H^{-1}(\T)  to C([0,T];H^{-1}(\T)) whereas it is ill-posed in  H^s(\T) , as soon as  s<-1 , in the sense that the flow-map u_0\mapsto u(t)  cannot be continuous from  H^s(\T)  to even {\cal D}'(\T)  at any fixed  t>0  small enough. In view of the result of Kappeler and Topalov for KdV it thus appears that even if the dissipation part of the KdV-Burgers equation allows to lower the  C^\infty  critical index with respect to the KdV equation, it does not permit to improve the  C^0 critical index .
