The \beta-generalized quasi-geostrophic equation is studied in the range of \alpha \in (0, 1), \beta \in (1/2, 1), 1/2 < \alpha + \beta < 3/2. When \alpha \in (1/2, 1), \beta \in (1/2, 1) such that 1 \leq \alpha + \beta < 3/2, using the method introduced in [12] and [9], we prove global regularity of the unique and analytic solution and when \alpha \in (0, 1/2), \beta \in (1/2, 1) such that 1/2 < \alpha + \beta < 1, that there exists a constant such that \lVert \nabla\theta_{0}\rVert_{L^{\infty}}^{2-2\alpha-2\beta}\lVert\theta_{0}\rVert_{L^{\infty}}^{2\alpha + 2\beta - 1} \leq c_{\alpha,\beta} implies global regularity.
