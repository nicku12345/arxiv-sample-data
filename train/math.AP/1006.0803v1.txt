We consider a integro-differential nonlinear model that describes the evolution of a population structured by a quantitative trait. The interactions between traits occur from competition for resources whose concentrations depend on the current state of the population. Following the formalism of\cite{DJMP}, we study a concentration phenomenon arising in the limit of strong selection and small mutations. We prove that the population density converges to a sum of Dirac masses characterized by the solution \phi of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation which depends on resource concentrations that we fully characterize in terms of the function \phi.
