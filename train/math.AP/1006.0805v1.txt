This paper is devoted to the analysis of some uniqueness properties of a classical reaction-diffusion equation of Fisher-KPP type, coming from population dynamics in heterogeneous environments. We work in a one-dimensional interval (a,b) and we assume a nonlinear term of the form u \, (\mu(x)-\gamma u) where \mu belongs to a fixed subset of C^{0}([a,b]). We prove that the knowledge of u at t=0 and of u, u_x at a single point x_0 and for small times t\in (0,\varepsilon) is sufficient to completely determine the couple (u(t,x),\mu(x)) provided \gamma is known. Additionally, if u_{xx}(t,x_0) is also measured for t\in (0,\varepsilon), the triplet (u(t,x),\mu(x),\gamma) is also completely determined. Those analytical results are completed with numerical simulations which show that, in practice, measurements of u and u_x at a single point x_0 (and for t\in (0,\varepsilon)) are sufficient to obtain a good approximation of the coefficient \mu(x). These numerical simulations also show that the measurement of the derivative u_x is essential in order to accurately determine \mu(x).
