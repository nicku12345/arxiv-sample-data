In this work we consider viscosity solutions to second order parabolic PDEs u_{t}+F(t,x,u,du,d^{2}u)=0 defined on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary conditions. We prove comparison, uniqueness and existence results for the solutions. Under the assumption that the manifold M has nonnegative sectional curvature, we get the finest results. If one additionally requires F to depend on d^{2}u in a uniformly continuous manner, the assumptions on curvature can be thrown away.
