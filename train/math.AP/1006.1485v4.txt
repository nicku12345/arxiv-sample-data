We consider L^{2}-supercritical and H^{1}-subcritical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We introduce a subset PW of H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) for d\ge 1, and investigate behavior of the solutions with initial data in this set. For this end, we divide PW into two disjoint components PW_{+} and PW_{-}. Then, it turns out that any solution starting from a datum in PW_{+} behaves asymptotically free, and solution starting from a datum in PW_{-} blows up or grows up, from which we find that the ground state has two unstable directions. We also investigate some properties of generic global and blowup solutions.
