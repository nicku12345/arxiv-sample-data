We consider a class of second order linear nonautonomous parabolic equations in R^d with time periodic unbounded coefficients. We give sufficient conditions for the evolution operator G(t,s) be compact in C_b(R^d) for t>s, and describe the asymptotic behavior of G(t,s)f as t-s goes to infinity in terms of a family of measures mu_s, s in R, solution of the associated Fokker-Planck equation.
