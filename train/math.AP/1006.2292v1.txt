In this work, we prove global existence of solutions for second order differential problems in a general framework. More precisely, we consider second order differential inclusions involving proximal normal cone to a set-valued map. This set-valued map is supposed to take admissible values (so in particular uniformly prox-regular values, which may be non-smooth and non-convex). Moreover we require the solution to satisfy an impact law, appearing in the description of mechanical systems with inelastic shocks.
