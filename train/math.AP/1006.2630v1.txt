We consider here a problem of finding the sharp estimate for the boundedness of an arbitrary Calder\'on-Zygmund operator in L^2(w), w\in A_2. We first prove that for A_2 weight w one has that the norm a Calderon--Zygmund operator T in L^2(w) is bounded by the sum of its weak norm, the weak norm of its adjoint, and the A_2 norm of the weight. From this result we derive that \|T\|_{L^2(w)\rightarrow L^2(w)} \le C\,[w]_{A_2}\log (1+[w]_{A_2}). We believe that the logarithmic factor is superflous. The approach is based on 2-weight estimates technique and, hence, on non-homogeneous harmonic analysis.
