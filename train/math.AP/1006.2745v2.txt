We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation   iu_t+ \Delta u+ \lambda |u|^\alpha u=0 in \R^N , in the H^s-subcritical and critical cases 0<\alpha \le 4/(N-2s), where 0<s<N/2. Local existence of solutions in H^s is well known. However, even though the solution is constructed by a fixed-point technique, continuous dependence in H^s does not follow from the contraction mapping argument. In this paper, assuming furthermore s<1, we show that the solution depends continuously on the initial value in the sense that the local flow is continuous H^s \to H^s. If, in addition, \alpha \ge 1 then the flow is Lipschitz. This completes previously known results concerning the cases s=0,1,2.
