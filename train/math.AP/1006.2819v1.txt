We consider the Navier-Stokes equation on \mathbb{H}^{2}(-a^{2}), the two dimensional hyperbolic space with constant sectional curvature -a^{2}. We prove an ill-posedness result in the sense that the uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down on \mathbb{H}^{2}(-a^{2}). We also obtain a corresponding result on a more general negatively curved manifold for a modified geometric version of the Navier-Stokes equation. Finally, as a corollary we also show a lack of the Liouville theorem in the hyperbolic setting both in two and three dimensions.
