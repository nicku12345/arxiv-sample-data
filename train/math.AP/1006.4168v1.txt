In this paper, we consider the defocusing cubic nonlinear wave equation u_{tt}-\Delta u+|u|^2u=0 in the energy-supercritical regime, in dimensions d\geq 6, with no radial assumption on the initial data. We prove that if a solution satisfies an a priori bound in the critical homogeneous Sobolev space throughout its maximal interval of existence, that is, u\in L_t^\infty(\dot{H}_x^{s_c}\times\dot{H}_x^{s_c-1}), then the solution is global and it scatters. Our analysis is based on the methods of the recent works of Kenig-Merle \cite{KenigMerleSupercritical} and Killip-Visan \cite{KillipVisanSupercriticalNLS,KillipVisanSupercriticalNLW3D} treating the energy-supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger and wave equations.
