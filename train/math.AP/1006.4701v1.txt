We study the interaction of (slowly modulated) high frequency waves for multi-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equations with gauge invariant power-law nonlinearities and non-local perturbations. The model includes the Davey--Stewartson system in its elliptic-elliptic and hyperbolic-elliptic variant. Our analysis reveals a new localization phenomenon for non-local perturbations in the high frequency regime and allows us to infer strong instability results on the Cauchy problem in negative order Sobolev spaces, where we prove norm inflation with infinite loss of regularity by a constructive approach.
