We study a class of Landau-de Gennes energy functionals in the asymptotic regime of small elastic constant L>0. We revisit and sharpen the results in [18] on the convergence to the limit Oseen-Frank functional. We examine how the Landau-de Gennes global minimizers are approximated by the Oseen-Frank ones by determining the first order term in their asymptotic expansion as L\to 0. We identify the appropriate functional setting in which the asymptotic expansion holds, the sharp rate of convergence to the limit and determine the equation for the first order term. We find that the equation has a ``normal component'' given by an algebraic relation and a ``tangential component'' given by a linear system.
