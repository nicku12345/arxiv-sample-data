This paper introduces a one-dimensional NPZD-model developed to simulate biological activity in a turbulent ocean water column. The model consists of a system of coupled semilinear parabolic equations. An initial-boundary value problem is formulated and the existence of a unique positive weak solution to it is proved. The existence result is derived using a variational formulation, an approximate model and a fixed-point method. It is shown that the qualitative analysis performed still applies if different parameterizations of several biological processes found in the biogeochemical modeling literature are used.
