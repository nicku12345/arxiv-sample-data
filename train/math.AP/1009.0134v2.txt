We investigate the long time behavior of the critical mass Patlak-Keller-Segel equation. This equation has a one parameter family of steady-state solutions \rho_\lambda, \lambda>0, with thick tails whose second moment is not bounded. We show that these steady state solutions are stable, and find basins of attraction for them using an entropy functional {\mathcal H}_\lambda coming from the critical fast diffusion equation in \R^2. We construct solutions of Patlak-Keller-Segel equation satisfying an entropy-entropy dissipation inequality for {\mathcal H}_\lambda. While the entropy dissipation for {\mathcal H}_\lambda is strictly positive, it turns out to be a difference of two terms, neither of which need to be small when the dissipation is small. We introduce a strategy of "controlled concentration" to deal with this issue, and then use the regularity obtained from the entropy-entropy dissipation inequality to prove the existence of basins of attraction for each stationary state composed by certain initial data converging towards \rho_\lambda. In the present paper, we do not provide any estimate of the rate of convergence, but we discuss how this would result from a stability result for a certain sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality.
