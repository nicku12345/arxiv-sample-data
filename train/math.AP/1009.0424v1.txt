We prove existence of solution of a p-curl type evolutionary system arising in electromagnetism with a power nonlinearity of order p, 1<p<\infty, assuming natural tangential boundary conditions. We consider also the asymptotic behaviour in the power obtaining, when p tends to infinity, a variational inequality with a curl constraint. We also discuss the existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the data of the solutions to general variational inequalities with curl constraints dependent on time, as well as the asymptotic stabilization in time towards the stationary solution with and without constraint.
