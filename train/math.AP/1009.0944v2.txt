We establish local well-posedness results in weak periodic function spaces for the Cauchy problem of the Benney system. The Sobolev space H^{1/2}\times L^2 is the lowest regularity attained and also we cover the energy space H^{1}\times L^2, where global well-posedness follows from the conservation laws of the system. Moreover, we show the existence of smooth explicit family of periodic travelling waves of \emph{dnoidal} type and we prove, under certain conditions, that this family is orbitally stable in the energy space.
