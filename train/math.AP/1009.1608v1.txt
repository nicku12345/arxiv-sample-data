We consider the Schr\"odinger Map equation in 2+1 dimensions, with values into \S^2. This admits a lowest energy steady state Q, namely the stereographic projection, which extends to a two dimensional family of steady states by scaling and rotation. We prove that Q is unstable in the energy space \dot H^1. However, in the process of proving this we also show that within the equivariant class Q is stable in a stronger topology X \subset \dot H^1.
