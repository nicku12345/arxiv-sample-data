We consider the generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equation   \partial_t u+\partial_x^3u+\mu\partial_x(u^{k+1})=0, where k\geq5 is an integer number and \mu=\pm1. In the focusing case (\mu=1), we show that if the initial data u_0 belongs to H^1(\R) and satisfies E(u_0)^{s_k} M(u_0)^{1-s_k} < E(Q)^{s_k} M(Q)^{1-s_k}, E(u_0)\geq0, and \|\partial_x u_0\|_{L^2}^{s_k}\|u_0\|_{L^2}^{1-s_k} < \|\partial_x Q\|_{L^2}^{s_k}\|Q\|_{L^2}^{1-s_k}, where M(u) and E(u) are the mass and energy, then the corresponding solution is global in H^1(\R). Here, s_k=\frac{(k-4)}{2k} and Q is the ground state solution corresponding to the gKdV equation. In the defocusing case (\mu=-1), if k is even, we prove that the Cauchy problem is globally well-posed in the Sobolev spaces H^s(\mathbb{R}), s>\frac{4(k-1)}{5k}.
