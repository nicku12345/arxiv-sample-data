We investigate existence and qualitative behaviour of solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with critical exponent and singular electromagnetic potentials. We are concerned with magnetic vector potentials which are homogeneous of degree -1, including the Aharonov-Bohm class. In particular, by variational arguments we prove a result of multiplicity of solutions distinguished by symmetry properties.
