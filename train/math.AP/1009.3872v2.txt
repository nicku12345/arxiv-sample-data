We study the equation -\Delta u+u^q=0, q>1, in a bounded C^2 domain \Omega\subset R^N. A positive solution of the equation is moderate if it is dominated by a harmonic function and \sigma-moderate if it is the limit of an increasing sequence of moderate solutions. It is known that in the sub-critical case, 1<q<q_c=(N+1)/(N-1), every positive solution is \sigma-moderate [31]. More recently Dynkin proved, by probabilistic methods, that this remains valid in the super-critical case for q\le2, [15]. The question remained open for q>2. In this paper we prove that, for all q\ge q_c, every positive solution is \sigma-moderate. We use purely analytic techniques which apply to the full super-critical range. The main tools come from linear and non-linear potential theory. Combined with previous results, this establishes a 1-1 correspondence between positive solutions and their boundary traces in the sense of [35].
