We show that, given a sufficiently regular forcing, the solution of the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations on the periodic \beta-plane (i.e.\ with the Coriolis force varying as f_0+\beta y) will become nearly zonal: with the vorticity \omega(x,y,t)=\wb(y,t)+\wt(x,y,t), one has |\wt|_{H^s}^2\le\beta^{-1} M_s(\...) as t\to\infty. We use this show that, for sufficiently large \beta, the global attractor of this system reduces to a point.
