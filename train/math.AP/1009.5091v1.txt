In this paper, we are interested in the L^p-estimates of the Boltzmann equation in the case that the distribution function stays around a travelling local Maxwellian. For this, we divide both sides of the Boltzmann equation by the velocity distribution function with a fractional exponent and reformulate the Boltzmann equation into a regularized one. This amounts to endowing additional integrability on the collision kernel, which in turn enables us to apply simple H\"{o}lder type inequalities. Our results cover the whole range of Lebesgue exponents: 0<p\leq \infty.
