This study explores the reconstruction of a signal using spectral quantities associated with some self-adjoint realization of an h-dependent Schr\"odinger operator when the parameter h tends to 0. Theoretical results in semi-classical analysis are proved. Some numerical results are also presented. We first consider as a toy model the sech^2 function. Then we study a real signal given by arterial blood pressure measurements. This approach seems to be very promising in signal analysis. Indeed it provides new spectral quantities that can give relevant information on some signals as it is the case for arterial blood pressure signal.
