By using some recent results for divergence form equations, we study the L_p-solvability of second-order elliptic and parabolic equations in nondivergence form for any p\in (1,\infty). The leading coefficients are assumed to be in locally BMO spaces with suitably small BMO seminorms. We not only extend several previous results by Krylov and Kim [14]-[18] to the full range of p, but also deal with equations with more general coefficients.
