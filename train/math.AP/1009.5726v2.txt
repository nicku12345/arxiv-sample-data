We show that the Cauchy problem for the defocusing generalized Boussinesq equation u_{tt}-u_{xx}+u_{xxxx}-(|u|^{2k}u)_{xx}=0, k\geq1, on the real line is globally well-posed in H^{s}(\R) for s>1-({1}/{3k}). We use the "I-method" to define a modification of the energy functional that is "almost conserved" in time. Our result extends the previous one obtained by Farah and Linares (2010 \textit{J. London Math. Soc.} \textbf{81} 241-254) when k=1.
