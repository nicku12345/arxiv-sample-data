In this article we consider the physical justification of the Vortex-Wave equation introduced by Marchioro and Pulvirenti in the case of a single point vortex moving in an ambient vorticity. We consider a sequence of solutions for the Euler equation in the plane corresponding to initial data consisting of an ambient vorticity in L^1\cap L^\infty and a sequence of concentrated blobs which approach the Dirac distribution. We introduce a notion of a weak solution of the Vortex-Wave equation in terms of velocity (or primitive variables) and then show, for a subsequence of the blobs, the solutions of the Euler equation converge in velocity to a weak solution of the Vortex-Wave equation.
