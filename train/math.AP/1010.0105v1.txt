We are concerned with fully nonlinear possibly degenerate elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with superlinear terms with respect to Du. We prove several comparison principles among viscosity solutions which may be unbounded under some polynomial-type growth conditions. Our main result applies to PDEs with convex superlinear terms but we also obtain some results in nonconvex cases. Applications to monotone systems of PDEs are given.
