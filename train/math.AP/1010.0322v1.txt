We prove Harnack inequality and local regularity results for weak solutions of a quasilinear degenerate equation in divergence form under natural growth conditions. The degeneracy is given by a suitable power of a strong A_\infty weight. Regularity results are achieved under minimal assumptions on the coefficients and, as an application, we prove C^{1,\alpha} local estimates for solutions of a degenerate equation in non divergence form.
