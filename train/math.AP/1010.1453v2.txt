We study operators on a singular manifold, here of conical or edge type, and develop a new general approach of representing asymptotics of solutions to elliptic equations close to the singularities. The idea is to construct so-called asymptotic parametrices with flat left -over terms. Our structures are motivated by models of particle physics with singular potentials that contribute embedded singularities in \R^N of higher order, according to the number of particles.
