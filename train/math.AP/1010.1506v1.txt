Any classical solution of the 2D incompressible Euler equation is global in time. However, it remains an outstanding open problem whether classical solutions of the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation preserve their regularity for all time. This paper studies solutions of a family of active scalar equations in which each component u_j of the velocity field u is determined by the scalar \theta through u_j =\mathcal{R} \Lambda^{-1} P(\Lambda) \theta where \mathcal{R} is a Riesz transform and \Lambda=(-\Delta)^{1/2}. The 2D Euler vorticity equation corresponds to the special case P(\Lambda)=I while the SQG equation to the case P(\Lambda) =\Lambda. We develop tools to bound \|\nabla u||_{L^\infty} for a general class of operators P and establish the global regularity for the Loglog-Euler equation for which P(\Lambda)= (\log(I+\log(I-\Delta)))^\gamma with 0\le \gamma\le 1. In addition, a regularity criterion for the model corresponding to P(\Lambda)=\Lambda^\beta with 0\le \beta\le 1 is also obtained.
