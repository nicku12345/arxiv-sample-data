This paper deals with two separate but related results. First we consider weak solutions to a parabolic operator with H\"ormander vector fields. Adapting the iteration scheme of J\"urgen Moser for elliptic and parabolic equations in \mathbb{R}^n we show a parabolic Harnack inequality. Then, after proving the Harnack inequality for weak solutions to equations of the form u_t = \sum X_i (a_{ij} X_j u) we use this to show H\"older continuity. We assume the coefficients are bounded and elliptic. The iteration scheme is a tool that may be adapted to many settings and we extend this to nonlinear parabolic equations of the form u_t = -X_i^* A_j(X_j u). With this we show both a Harnack inequality and H\"older continuity of weak solutions.
