We study the propagation of time-harmonic acoustic or transverse magnetic (TM) polarized electromagnetic waves in a periodic waveguide lying in the semi-strip (0,\infty)\times(0,L). It is shown that there exists a Riesz basis of the space of solutions to the time-harmonic wave equation such that the translation operator shifting a function by one periodicity length to the left is represented by an infinite Jordan matrix which contains at most a finite number of Jordan blocks of size > 1. Moreover, the Dirichlet-, Neumann- and mixed traces of this Riesz basis on the left boundary also form a Riesz basis. Both the cases of frequencies in a band gap and frequencies in the spectrum and a variety of boundary conditions on the top and bottom are considered.
