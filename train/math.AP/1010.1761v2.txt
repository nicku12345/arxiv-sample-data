We present a reduced basis offline/online procedure for viscous Burgers initial boundary value problem, enabling efficient approximate computation of the solutions of this equation for parametrized viscosity and initial and boundary value data. This procedure comes with a fast-evaluated rigorous error bound certifying the approximation procedure. Our numerical experiments show significant computational savings, as well as efficiency of the error bound.
