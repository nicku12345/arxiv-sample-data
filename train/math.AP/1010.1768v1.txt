We exhibit \mathcal C^{\infty} type II blow up solutions to the focusing energy critical wave equation in dimension N=4. These solutions admit near blow up time a decomposiiton u(t,x)=1/l(t)(Q+e(t))(x/l(t)}} with |e(t),\pa_t e(t)|_{\dot{H}^1\times L^2}<<1 where Q is the extremizing profile of the Sobolev embedding \dot{H}^1\subset L^{2^*}, and a blow up speed l(t)=(T-t)e^{-\sqrt{|\log (T-t)|}(1+o(1))} as t\to T.
