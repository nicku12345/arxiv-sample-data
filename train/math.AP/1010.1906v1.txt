We prove unique continuation properties for solutions of the evolution Schr\"odinger equation with time dependent potentials. As an application of our method we also obtain results concerning the possible concentration profiles of blow up solutions and the possible profiles of the traveling waves solutions of semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations.
