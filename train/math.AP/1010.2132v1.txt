In this paper, we study a vector conservation law that models the growth and selection of ovarian follicles. During each ovarian cycle, only a definite number of follicles ovulate, while the others undergo a degeneration process called atresia. This work is motivated by a multiscale mathematical model starting on the cellular scale, where ovulation or atresia result from a hormonally controlled selection process. A two-dimensional conservation law describes the age and maturity structuration of the follicular cell populations. The densities intersect through a coupled hyperbolic system between different follicles and cell phases, which results in a vector conservation law and coupling boundary conditions. The maturity velocity functions possess both a local and nonlocal character. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to the Cauchy problem with bounded initial and boundary data.
