In this paper, we study rank-1 projector solutions to the completely integrable Euclidean CP^{N-1} sigma model in two dimension and their associated surfaces immersed in the su(N) Lie algebra. We reinterpret and generalize the proof of A.M. Din and W.J. Zakzrewski [1980] that any solution for the CP^{N-1} sigma model defined on the Riemann sphere with finite action can be written as a raising operator acting on a holomorphic one, or a lowering operator acting on a antiholomorphic one. Our proof is formulated in terms of rank-1 Hermitian projectors so it is explicitly gauge invariant and gives new results on the structure of the corresponding sequence of rank-1 projectors. Next, we analyze surfaces associated with the CP^{N-1} models defined using the Generalized Weierstrass Formula for immersion, introduced by B. Konopelchenko [1996]. We show that the surfaces are conformally parameterized by the Lagrangian density with finite area equal to the action of the model and express several other geometrical characteristics of the surface in terms of the Lagrangian density and topological charge density of the model. We demonstrate that any such surface must be orthogonal to the sequence of projectors defined by repeated application of the raising and lowering operators. Finally, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that a surface be related to a CP^{N-1} sigma model.
