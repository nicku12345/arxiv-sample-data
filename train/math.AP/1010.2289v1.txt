We consider the following semilinear elliptic equation on a strip: \[ \left\{{array}{l} \Delta u-u + u^p=0 \ {in} \ \R^{N-1} \times (0, L), u>0, \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=0 \ {on} \ \partial (\R^{N-1} \times (0, L)) {array} \right.\] where  1< p\leq \frac{N+2}{N-2}. When  1<p <\frac{N+2}{N-2}, it is shown that there exists a unique L_{*} >0 such that for L \leq L_{*}, the least energy solution is trivial, i.e., doesn't depend on x_N, and for L >L_{*}, the least energy solution is nontrivial. When N \geq 4, p=\frac{N+2}{N-2}, it is shown that there are two numbers L_{*}<L_{**} such that the least energy solution is trivial when L \leq L_{*}, the least energy solution is nontrivial when L \in (L_{*}, L_{**}], and the least energy solution does not exist when L >L_{**}. A connection with Delaunay surfaces in CMC theory is also made.
