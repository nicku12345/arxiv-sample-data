Parametric factorizations of linear partial operators on the plane are considered for operators of orders two, three and four. The operators are assumed to have a completely factorable symbol. It is proved that ``irreducible'' parametric factorizations may exist only for a few certain types of factorizations. Examples are given of the parametric families for each of the possible types. For the operators of orders two and three, it is shown that any factorization family is parameterized by a single univariate function   (which can be a constant function).
