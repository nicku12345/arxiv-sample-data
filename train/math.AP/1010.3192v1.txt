The work analyzes a one-dimensional viscoelastic model of blood vessel growth under nonlinear friction with surroundings, and provides numerical simulations for various growing cases. For the nonlinear differential equations, two sufficient conditions are proven to guarantee the global existence of biologically meaningful solutions. Examples with breakdown solutions are captured by numerical approximations. Numerical simulations demonstrate this model can reproduce angiogenesis experiments under various biological conditions including blood vessel extension without proliferation and blood vessel regression.
