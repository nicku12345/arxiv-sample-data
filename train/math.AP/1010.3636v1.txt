In this paper we characterize the output feedback stabilization of some coupled systems with delay. The proof of the main result uses the method introduced in Ammari and Tucsnak \cite{at} where the exponential stability for the closed loop system is reduced to an observability estimate for the corresponding conservative adjoint system, under a boundedness condition of the transfer function of the associated open loop system.
