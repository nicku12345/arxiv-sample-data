In this paper, under Acquistpace-Terreni conditions, we make extensive use of interpolation spaces and exponential dichotomy techniques to obtain the existence of weighted pseudo almost periodic solutions to some classes of nonautonomous partial evolution equations. Applications include the existence of weighted pseudo almost periodic solutions to a nonautonomous heat equation with gradient coefficients.
