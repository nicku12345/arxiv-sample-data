Motivated by transverse stability issues, we address the time evolution under the KP-II flow of perturbations of a solution which does not decay in all directions, for instance the KdV-line soliton. We study two different types of perturbations : perturbations that are square integrable in  \R\times \T  and perturbations that are square integrable in  \R^2 . In both cases we prove the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem associated with such initial data.
