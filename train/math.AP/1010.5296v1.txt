This paper is concerned with the incompressible limit of the compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with periodic boundary conditions. It is rigorously shown that the weak solutions of the compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations converge to the strong solution of the viscous or inviscid incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations as long as the latter exists both for the well-prepared initial data and general initial data. Furthermore, the convergence rates are also obtained in the case of the well-prepared initial data.
