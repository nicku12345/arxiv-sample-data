In present note we establish the following inequality for the the Leray-Hopf solutions of the 3-D \Omega-periodic Navier-Stokes Equations: \[\phi(|u(t)|^2)-\phi(|u(t_0)|^2)\le 2\int_{t_0}^{t}\phi'(|u(\tau)|^2) [-\nu|A^{1/2}u(\tau)|^2+(g(\tau),u(\tau))]\,d\tau\] for all t_0 Leray-Hopf points, t\ge t_0, and \phi:\mathbb{R}_{+}\to\mathbb{R} is an absolutely continouos non-decreasing function with bounded derivative. %with \phi'(\xi)\ge0 for all \xi>0. Here (\cdot,\cdot) and |\cdot| is correspondingly the L^2 inner product and the L^2 norm on \Omega, and A is the Stokes operator.
