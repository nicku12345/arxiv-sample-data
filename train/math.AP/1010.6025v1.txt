We investigate the validity and failure of Liouville theorems and Harnack inequalities for parabolic and elliptic operators with low regularity coefficients. We are particularly interested in operators of the form \partial_t - \Delta +b\cdot\nabla and -\Delta +b\cdot\nabla with a divergence-free drift b. We prove the Liouville theorem and Harnack inequality when b\in L_\infty(BMO^{-1}) resp. b\in BMO^{-1} and provide a counterexample to such results demonstrating sharpness of our conditions on the drift. Our results generalize to divergence-form operators with an elliptic symmetric part and a BMO skew-symmetric part. We also prove the existence of a modulus of continuity for solutions to the elliptic problem in two dimensions, depending on the non-scale-invariant norm \|b\|_{L_1}. In three dimensions, on the other hand, bounded solutions with L_1 drifts may be discontinuous.
