The main purpose of this work is to study uniform regularity estimates for a family of elliptic operators \{\mathcal{L}_\varepsilon, \varepsilon>0\}, arising in the theory of homogenization, with rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients. We establish sharp W^{1,p} estimates, Lipschitz estimates, and nontangential maximal function estimates, which are uniform in the parameter \varepsilon, on solutions with Neumann boundary conditions in C^{1,\alpha} domains.
