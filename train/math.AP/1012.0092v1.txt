We consider the nonlinear magnetic Schr\"odinger equation for  u: \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C} , \[ iu_t = (i \nabla + A)^2 u + V u + g(u), u(x,0) = u_0(x),\] where  A :\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3  is the magnetic potential,  V : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}  is the electric potential, and  g = \pm | u |^2 u  is the nonlinear term. We show that under suitable assumptions on the electric and magnetic potentials, if the initial data is small enough in  H^1 , then the solution of the above equation decomposes uniquely into a standing wave part, which converges as t \to \infty and a dispersive part, which scatters.
