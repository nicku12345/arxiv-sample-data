We show that smooth, radially symmetric wave maps U from \mathbb R^{2+1} to a compact target manifold N, where \partial_r U and \partial_t U have compact support for any fixed time, scatter. The result will follow from the work of Christodoulou and Tahvildar-Zadeh, and Struwe, upon proving that for \lambda' \in (0,1), energy does not concentrate in the set K_{5/8T,7/8T}^{\lambda'} = {(x,t) \in \mathbb R^{2+1} | {5pt} |x| \leq \lambda' t, t \in [(5/8)T,(7/8)T]}.
