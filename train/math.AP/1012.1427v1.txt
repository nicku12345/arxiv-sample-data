We prove the existence of quasi-periodic solutions for Schroedinger equations with a multiplicative potential on T^d, d \geq 1, merely differentiable nonlinearities, and tangential frequencies constrained along a pre-assigned direction. The solutions have only Sobolev regularity both in time and space. If the nonlinearity and the potential are infinitely many times differentiable so are the solutions. The proofs are based on an improved Nash-Moser iterative scheme, which assumes the weakest tame estimates for the inverse linearized operators ("Green functions") along scales of Sobolev spaces. The key off-diagonal decay estimates of the Green functions are proved via a new multiscale inductive analysis. The main novelty concerns the measure and "complexity" estimates.
