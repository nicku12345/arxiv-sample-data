Let u be the solution of u_t=\Delta\log u in \R^N\times (0,T), N=3 or N\ge 5, with initial value u_0 satisfying B_{k_1}(x,0)\le u_0\le B_{k_2}(x,0) for some constants k_1>k_2>0 where B_k(x,t) =2(N-2)(T-t)_+^{N/(N-2)}/(k+(T-t)_+^{2/(N-2)}|x|^2) is the Barenblatt solution for the equation. We prove that the rescaled function \4{u}(x,s)=(T-t)^{-N/(N-2)}u(x/(T-t)^{-1/(N-2)},t), s=-\log (T-t), converges uniformly on \R^N to the rescaled Barenblatt solution \4{B}_{k_0}(x)=2(N-2)/(k_0+|x|^2) for some k_0>0 as s\to\infty. We also obtain convergence of the rescaled solution \4{u}(x,s) as s\to\infty when the initial data satisfies 0\le u_0(x)\le B_{k_0}(x,0) in \R^N and |u_0(x)-B_{k_0}(x,0)|\le f(|x|)\in L^1(\R^N) for some constant k_0>0 and some radially symmetric function f.
