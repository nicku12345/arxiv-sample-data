We consider nonlocal linear Schr\"odinger-type critical systems of the type   \begin{equation}\label{eqabstr}   \Delta^{1/4} v=\Omega\, v~~~\mbox{in \R\,.} \   \end{equation} where \Omega is antisymmetric potential in L^2(\R,so(m)), v is a {\R}^m valued map and \Omega\, v denotes the matrix multiplication. We show that every solution v\in L^2(\R,\R^m) of \rec{eqabstr} is in fact in L^p_{loc}(\R,\R^m), for every 2\le p<+\infty, in other words, we prove that the system (\ref{eqabstr}) which is a-priori only critical in L^2 happens to have a subcritical behavior for antisymmetric potentials.   As an application we obtain the C^{0,\alpha}_{loc} regularity of weak 1/2-harmonic maps into C^2 compact manifold without boundary.
