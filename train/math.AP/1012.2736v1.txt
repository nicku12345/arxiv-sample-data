It is well known that the incompressible Euler equations can be formulated in a very geometric language. The geometric structures provide very valuable insights into the properties of the solutions. Analogies with the finite-dimensional model of geodesics on a Lie group with left-invariant metric can be very instructive, but it is often difficult to prove analogues of finite-dimensional results in the infinite-dimensional setting of Euler's equations. In this paper we establish a result in this direction in the simple case of steady-state solutions in two dimensions, under some non-degeneracy assumptions. In particular, we establish, in a non-degenerate situation, a local one-to-one correspondence between steady-states and co-adjoint orbits.
