In this paper we consider critical points of the following nonlocal energy {equation} {\cal{L}}_n(u)=\int_{\R^n}| ({-\Delta})^{n/4} u(x)|^2 dx\,, {equation} where u\colon H^{n/2}(\R^n)\to{\cal{N}}\, {\cal{N}}\subset\R^m is a compact k dimensional smooth manifold without boundary and n>1 is an odd integer. Such critical points are called n/2-harmonic maps into {\cal{N}}. We prove that \Delta ^{n/2} u\in L^p_{loc}(\R^n) for every p\ge 1 and thus u\in C^{0,\alpha}_{loc}(\R^n)\,. The local H\"older continuity of n/2-harmonic maps is based on regularity results obtained in \cite{DL1} for nonlocal Schr\"odinger systems with an antisymmetric potential and on suitable {\it 3-terms commutators} estimates.
