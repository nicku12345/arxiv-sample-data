We propose a general Noetherian approach to Rellich integral identities. Using this method we obtain a higher order Rellich type identity involving the polyharmonic operator on Riemannian manifolds admitting homothetic transformations. Then we prove a biharmonic Rellich identity in a more general context. We also establish a nonexistence result for semilinear systems involving biharmonic operators.
