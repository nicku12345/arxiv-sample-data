We consider periodic homogenization problems for the L{\'e}vy operators with asymmetric L{\'e}vy densities. The formal asymptotic expansion used for the \a-stable (symmetric) L{\'e}vy operators (\a\in (0,2)) is not applicable directly to such asymmetric cases. We rescale the asymmetric densities, extract the most singular part of the measures, which average out the microscopic dependences in the homogenization procedures. We give two conditions (A) and (B), which characterize such a class of asymmetric densities, that the above "rescaled" homogenization is available.
