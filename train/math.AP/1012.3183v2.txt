We establish the Strauss conjecture for nontrapping obstacles when the spatial dimension n is two. As pointed out in \cite{HMSSZ} this case is more subtle than n=3 or 4 due to the fact that the arguments of the first two authors \cite{SmSo00}, Burq \cite{B} and Metcalfe \cite{M} showing that local Strichartz estimates for obstactles imply global ones require that the Sobolev index, \gamma, equal 1/2 when n=2. We overcome this difficulty by interpolating between energy estimates (\gamma =0) and ones for \gamma=\frac12 that are generalizations of Minkowski space estimates of Fang and the third author \cite{FaWa2}, \cite{FaWa}, the second author \cite{So08} and Sterbenz \cite{St05}.
