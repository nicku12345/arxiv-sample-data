The propagation of analyticity for a solution u(t,x) to a nonlinear weakly hyperbolic equation of order m, means that if u, and its time derivatives up to the order m-1, are analytic in the space variables x at the initial time, then they remain analytic for any time. Here we prove that such a property holds for the solutions bounded in C-infinity of a special class of homogeneous equations in one space variable, with time dependent coefficient.
