A uniform gradient for functions u which satisfy a system of N second-order partial differential inequalities is given in this paper. Some structure conditions are given for the coefficients of the matrices of second-order terms and of first-order terms. This result can be applied to study the gradient estimate of a class of second-order degenerate elliptic partial differential equations.
