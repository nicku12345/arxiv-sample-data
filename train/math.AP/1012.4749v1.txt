We consider the family of singularly nonautonomous plate equation with structural damping \[ u_{tt} + a(t,x)u_{t} + (- \Delta) u_{t} + (-\Delta)^{2} u + \lambda u = f(u), \] in a bounded domain \Omega \subset \R^n, with Navier boundary conditions. When the nonlinearity f is dissipative we show that this problem is globally well posed in H^2_0(\Omega) \times L^2(\Omega) and has a family of pullback attractors which is upper-semicontinuous under small perturbations of the damping a.
