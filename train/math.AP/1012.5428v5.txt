We prove the existence of infinitely many classical periodic solutions for a class of degenerate semilinear wave equations: \[ u_{tt}-u_{xx}+|u|^{s-1}u=f(x,t), \] for all s>1. In particular we prove the existence of infinitely many classical solutions for the case s=3 posed by Br\'ezis in \cite{BrezisBAMS}. The proof relies on a new upper a priori estimates for minimax values of, a pertubed from symmetry, strongly indefinite functional,depending on a small parameter.
