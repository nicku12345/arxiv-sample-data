This paper is concerned with blow-up phenomena and global existence for a periodic two-component Hunter-Saxton system. We first derive the precise blow-up scenario for strong solutions to the system. Then, we present several new blow-up results of strong solutions and a new global existence result to the system. Our obtained results for the system are sharp and improve considerably earlier results.
