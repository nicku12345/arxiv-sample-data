Let \Omega be a bounded domain in \mathbb{R}^N. In this paper, we consider the following nonlinear elliptic equation of N-Laplacian type: -\Delta_{N}u=f(x,u) where u\in W_{0}^{1,2}\{0} when f is of subcritical or critical exponential growth. This nonlinearity is motivated by the Moser-Trudinger inequality. In fact, we will prove the existence of a nontrivial nonnegative solution to the above equation without the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz (AR) condition. Earlier works in the literature on the existence of nontrivial solutions to N-Laplacian in \mathbb{R}^{N} when the nonlinear term f has the exponential growth only deal with the case when f satisfies the (AR) condition. Our approach is based on a suitable version of the Mountain Pass Theorem introduced by G. Cerami \cite{Ce1, Ce2}. This approach can also be used to yield an existence result for the p-Laplacian equation (1<p<N) in the subcritical polynomial growth case.
