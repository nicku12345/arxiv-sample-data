In this paper we obtain an inequality on the unit disc B in the plane, which improves the classical Moser-Trudinger inequality and the classical Hardy inequality at the same time. Namely, there exists a constant C_0>0 such that \[ \int_B e^{\frac {4\pi u^2}{H(u)}} dx \le C_0 < \infty, \quad \forall\; u\in C^\infty_0(B),\] where H(u) := \int_B |\n u|^2 dx - \int_B \frac {u^2}{(1-|x|^2)^2} dx.   This inequality is a two dimensional analog of the Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequality in higher dimensions, which was recently intensively studied. We also prove that the supremum is achieved in a suitable function space, which is an analog of the celebrated result of Carleson-Chang for the Moser-Trudinger inequality.
