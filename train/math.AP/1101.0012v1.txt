We prove that there exists an extremal function to the Airy Strichartz inequality, e^{-t\partial_x^3}: L^2(\mathbb{R})\to L^8_{t,x}(\mathbb{R}^2) by using the linear profile decomposition. Furthermore we show that, if f is an extremiser, then f is extremely fast decaying in Fourier space and so f can be extended to be an entire function on the whole complex domain. The rapid decay of the Fourier transform of extremisers is established with a bootstrap argument which relies on a refined bilinear Airy Strichartz estimate and a weighted Strichartz inequality.
