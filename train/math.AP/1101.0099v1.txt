Let -\lambda_j be the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on the unit disk with Dirichlet conditions. The distribution h(t) = \sum_j e^{i\sqrt\lambda_j t} is the trace of the solution operator of the wave equation on the disk. It is well known that h has isolated singularities at the lengths of the reflecting geodesics. In particular, h is singular at t_k, the perimeter of the regular inscribed polygon with k sides. Evidently, t_k < 2\pi, the perimeter of the circle, and t_k tends to 2\pi. In this paper, we show that h(t) is infinitely differentiable as t tends to 2\pi from the right.
