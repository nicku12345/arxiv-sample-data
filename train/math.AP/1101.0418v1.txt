We establish that a closed set E is removable for C^{0,\alpha} H\"{o}lder continuous p(x)-harmonic functions in a bounded open domain \Omega of \mathbb{R}^n, n\geq 2, provided that for each compact subset K of E, the (n-p_K+\alpha(p_K-1))-Hausdorff measure of K is zero, where p_K=\max_{x\in K} p(x).
