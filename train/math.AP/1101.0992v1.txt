There exists an exponentially decreasing function f such that any singly 2\pi-periodic positive solution u of -\Delta u +u-u^p=0 in [0,2\pi]\times \R^{N-1} verifies u(x_1,x')\leq f(|x'|). We prove that with the same period and with the same function f, any singly periodic positive solution of -\ep^2\Delta u-u+u^p=0 in [0,2\pi]\times \R^{N-1} verifies u(x_1,x')\leq f(|x'| /\ep ) . We have a similar estimate for the gradient.
