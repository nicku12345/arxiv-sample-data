In this paper, we study the geometry associated with Schroedinger operator via Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalism. Making use of a multiplier technique, we construct the heat kernel with the coefficient matrices of the operator both diagonal and non-diagonal. For applications, we compute the heat kernel of a Schroedinger operator with terms of lower order, and obtain a globally closed solution to a matrix Riccati equations as a by-product. Besides, we finally recover and generalise several classical results on some celebrated operators.
