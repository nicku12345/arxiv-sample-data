In this article, we investigate the regularity for certain elliptic systems without a L^2-antisymmetric structure. As applications, we prove some \epsilon-regularity theorems for weakly harmonic maps from the unit ball B= B(m) \subset \mathbb{R}^m  (m\geq2) into certain pseudo-Riemannian manifolds: standard stationary Lorentzian manifolds, pseudospheres \mathbb{S}^n_\nu \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}_\nu (1\leq\nu \leq n) and pseudohyperbolic spaces \mathbb{H}^n_\nu \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}_{\nu+1} (0\leq\nu \leq n-1). Consequently, such maps are shown to be H\"{o}lder continuous (and as smooth as the regularity of the targets permits) in dimension m=2. In particular, we prove that any weakly harmonic map from a disc into the De-Sitter space \mathbb{S}^n_1 or the Anti-de-Sitter space \mathbb{H}^n_1 is smooth. Also, we give an alternative proof of the H\"{o}lder continuity of any weakly harmonic map from a disc into the Hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^n without using the fact that the target is nonpositively curved. Moreover, we extend the notion of generalized (weakly) harmonic maps from a disc into the standard sphere \mathbb{S}^n to the case that the target is \mathbb{S}^n_\nu (1\leq\nu \leq n) or \mathbb{H}^n_\nu (0\leq\nu \leq n-1), and obtain some \epsilon-regularity results for such generalized (weakly) harmonic maps.
