We consider the Cauchy problem for the focusing Hartree equation iu_{t}+\Delta u+(|\cdot|^{-3}\ast|u|^{2})u=0 in \mathbb{R}^{5} with the initial data in H^1, and study the divergent property of infinite-variance and nonradial solutions. Letting Q be the ground state solution of -Q+\Delta Q+(|\cdot|^{-3}\ast|Q|^{2})Q=0  in  \mathbb{R}^{5}, we prove that if u_{0}\in H^{1} satisfying M(u_0) E(u_0)<M(Q) E(Q) and   \|\nabla u_{0}\|_{2}\|u_{0}\|_{2} >\|\nabla Q\|_{2}\|Q\|_{2} , then the corresponding solution u(t) either blows up in finite forward time, or exists globally for positive time and there exists a time sequence t_{n}\rightarrow+\infty such that \|\nabla u(t_{n})\|_{2}\rightarrow+\infty. A similar result holds for negative time.
