This paper establishes several existence and uniqueness results for two families of active scalar equations with velocity fields determined by the scalars through very singular integrals. The first family is a generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation with the velocity field u related to the scalar \theta by u=\nabla^\perp\Lambda^{\beta-2}\theta, where 1<\beta\le 2 and \Lambda=(-\Delta)^{1/2} is the Zygmund operator. The borderline case \beta=1 corresponds to the SQG equation and the situation is more singular for \beta>1. We obtain the local existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, the global existence of weak solutions and the local existence of patch type solutions. The second family is a dissipative active scalar equation with u=\nabla^\perp (\log(I-\Delta))^\mu\theta for \mu>0, which is at least logarithmically more singular than the velocity in the first family. We prove that this family with any fractional dissipation possesses a unique local smooth solution for any given smooth data. This result for the second family constitutes a first step towards resolving the global regularity issue recently proposed by K. Ohkitani \cite{Oh}.
