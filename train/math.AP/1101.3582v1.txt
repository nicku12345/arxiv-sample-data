We study the existence and stability of the standing waves for the periodic cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a point defect determined by a periodic Dirac distribution at the origin. This equation admits a smooth curve of positive periodic solutions in the form of standing waves with a profile given by the Jacobi elliptic function of dnoidal type. Via a perturbation method and continuation argument, we obtain that in the case of an attractive defect the standing wave solutions are stable in H^1_{per} with respect to perturbations which have the same period as the wave itself. In the case of a repulsive defect, the standing wave solutions are stable in the subspace of even functions of H^1_{per} and unstable in H^1_{per} with respect to perturbations which have the same period as the wave itself.
