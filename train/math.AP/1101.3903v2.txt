Let \lambda^{*}>0 denote the largest possible value of \lambda such that  \{{array}{lllllll} \Delta^{2}u=\lambda(1+u)^{p} & {in}\ \ \B, %0<u\leq 1 & {in}\ \ \B, u=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} =0 & {on}\ \ \partial \B {array}.  has a solution, where \B is the unit ball in R^{n} centered at the origin, p>\frac{n+4}{n-4} and n is the exterior unit normal vector. We show that for \lambda=\lambda^{*} this problem possesses a unique weak solution u^{*}, called the extremal solution. We prove that u^{*} is singular when n\geq 13 for p large enough, in which case u^{*}(x)\leq r^{-\frac{4}{p-1}}-1 on the unit ball.
