We study the following semilinear biharmonic equation  \left\{\begin{array}{lllllll} \Delta^{2}u=\frac{\lambda}{1-u}, &\quad \mbox{in}\quad \B, u=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0, &\quad \mbox{on}\quad \partial\B, \end{array} \right. %\eqno(M_{\lambda})  where \B is the unit ball in \R^{n} and n is the exterior unit normal vector. We prove the existence of \lambda^{*}>0 such that for \lambda\in (0,\lambda^{*}) there exists a minimal (classical) solution \underline{u}_{\lambda}, which satisfies 0<\underline{u}_{\lambda}<1. In the extremal case \lambda=\lambda^{*}, we prove the existence of a weak solution which is unique solution even in a very weak sense. Besides, several new difficulties arise and many problems still remain to be solved. we list those of particular interest in the final section.
