We prove the existence of regular dissipative solutions and global attractors for the 3D Brinkmann-Forchheimer equations with the nonlinearity of an arbitrary polynomial growth rate. In order to obtain this result, we prove the maximal regularity estimate for the corresponding semi-linear stationary Stokes problem using some modification of the nonlinear localization technique. The applications of our results to the Brinkmann-Forchheimer equation with the Navier-Stokes inertial term are also considered.
