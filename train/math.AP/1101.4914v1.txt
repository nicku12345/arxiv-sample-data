Consider a discrete uniformly elliptic divergence form equation on the d dimensional lattice \Z^d with random coefficients. It has previously been shown that if the random environment is translational invariant, then the averaged Green's function together with its first and second differences, are bounded by the corresponding quantities for the constant coefficient discrete elliptic equation. It has also been shown that if the random environment is ergodic, then solutions of the random equation converge under diffusive scaling to solutions of a homogenized elliptic PDE on \R^d. In this paper point-wise estimates are obtained on the difference between the averaged Green's function and the homogenized Green's function for certain random environments which are strongly mixing.
