We show that any non-degenerate vector field u in  L^{\infty}(\Omega, \R^N), where \Omega is a bounded domain in \R^N, can be written as {equation} \hbox{u(x)= \nabla_1 H(S(x), x) for a.e. x \in \Omega}, {equation} where S is a measure preserving point transformation on \Omega such that S^2=I a.e (an involution), and H: \R^N \times \R^N \to \R is a globally Lipschitz anti-symmetric convex-concave Hamiltonian. Moreover, u is a monotone map if and only if S can be taken to be the identity, which suggests that our result is a self-dual version of Brenier's polar decomposition for the vector field u as u(x)=\nabla \phi (S(x)), where \phi is convex and S is a measure preserving transformation. We also describe how our polar decomposition can be reformulated as a self-dual mass transport problem.
