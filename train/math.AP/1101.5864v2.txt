We investigate global strong solutions for the incompressible viscoelastic system of Oldroyd--B type with the initial data close to a stable equilibrium. We obtain the existence and uniqueness of the global solution in a functional setting invariant by the scaling of the associated equations, where the initial velocity has the same critical regularity index as for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, and one more derivative is needed for the deformation tensor. Like the classical incompressible Navier-Stokes, one may construct the unique global solution for a class of large highly oscillating initial velocity. Our result also implies that the deformation tensor F has the same regularity as the density of the compressible Navier--Stokes equations.
