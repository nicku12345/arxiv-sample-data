Using the Fermi Golden Rule analysis developed in several results by the first author, we prove asymptotic stability of asymmetric nonlinear bound states bifurcating from linear bound states for a quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger operator with symmetric potential. This goes in the direction of proving that the approximate periodic solutions of the NLS shadowed in a recent work of the second author with Michael Weinstein do not persist for the full NLS.
