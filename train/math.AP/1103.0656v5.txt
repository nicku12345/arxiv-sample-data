In this article we study both left-invariant (convection-)diffusions and left-invariant Hamilton-Jacobi equations on the space SE(3)/({0} \times SO(2)) of 3D-positions and orientations naturally embedded in the group SE(3) of 3D-rigid body movements. The general motivation for these (convection-)diffusions and erosions is to obtain crossing-preserving fiber enhancement on probability densities defined on the space of positions and orientations. The linear left-invariant (convection-)diffusions are forward Kolmogorov equations of Brownian motions on SE(3)/({0}\timesSO(2)) and can be solved by convolution with the corresponding Green's functions or by a finite difference scheme. The left-invariant Hamilton-Jacobi equations are Bellman equations of cost processes on SE(3)/({0}\timesSO(2)) and they are solved by a morphological convolution with the corresponding Green's functions. Furthermore, we consider pseudo-linear scale spaces on the space of positions and orientations that combines dilation and diffusion in a single evolution. In our design and analysis for appropriate linear, non-linear, morphological and pseudo-linear scale spaces on SE(3)/({0}\timesSO(2)) we employ the underlying differential geometry on SE(3), where the frame of left-invariant vector fields serves as a moving frame of reference. Furthermore, we will present new and simpler finite difference schemes for our diffusions, which are clear improvements of our previous finite difference schemes. We apply our theory to the enhancement of fibres in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for imaging water diffusion processes in brain white matter. We provide experiments of our crossing-preserving evolutions on neural images of a human brain containing crossing fibers.
