This paper aims to study a family of Leray-\alpha models with periodic bounbary conditions. These models are good approximations for the Navier-Stokes equations. We focus our attention on the critical value of regularization "\theta" that garantees the global well-posedness for these models. We conjecture that \theta= 1/4 is the critical value to obtain such results.   When alpha goes to zero, we prove that the Leray-\alpha solution, with critical regularization, gives rise to a suitable solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. We also introduce an interpolating deconvolution operator that depends on "\theta". Then we extend our results of existence, uniqueness and convergence to a family of regularized magnetohydrodynamics equations.
