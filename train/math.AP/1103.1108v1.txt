We extend the notion of H-measures on test functions defined on \R^d\times P, where P\subset \R^d is an arbitrary compact simply connected Lipschitz manifold such that there exists a family of regular nonintersecting curves issuing from the manifold and fibrating \R^d. We introduce a concept of quasi-solutions to purely fractional scalar conservation laws and apply our extension of the H-measures to prove strong L^1_{loc} precompactness of such quasi-solutions.
