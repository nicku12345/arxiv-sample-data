In this paper, we study a class of nonlocal dispersion equation with monostable nonlinearity in n-dimensional space u_t - J\ast u +u+d(u(t,x))= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f_\beta (y) b(u(t-\tau,x-y)) dy, u(s,x)=u_0(s,x), s\in[-\tau,0], \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n} \] where the nonlinear functions d(u) and b(u) possess the monostable characters like Fisher-KPP type, f_\beta(x) is the heat kernel, and the kernel J(x) satisfies {\hat J}(\xi)=1-\mathcal{K}|\xi|^\alpha+o(|\xi|^\alpha) for 0<\alpha\le 2. After establishing the existence for both the planar traveling waves \phi(x\cdot{\bf e}+ct) for c\ge c_* (c_* is the critical wave speed) and the solution u(t,x) for the Cauchy problem, as well as the comparison principles, we prove that, all noncritical planar wavefronts \phi(x\cdot{\bf e}+ct) are globally stable with the exponential convergence rate t^{-n/\alpha}e^{-\mu_\tau} for \mu_\tau>0, and the critical wavefronts \phi(x\cdot{\bf e}+c_*t) are globally stable in the algebraic form t^{-n/\alpha}. The adopted approach is Fourier transform and the weighted energy method with a suitably selected weight function. These rates are optimal and the stability results significantly develop the existing studies for nonlocal dispersion equations.
