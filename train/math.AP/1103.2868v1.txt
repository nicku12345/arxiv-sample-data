We consider self-similar solutions of Smoluchowski's coagulation equation with a diagonal kernel of homogeneity \gamma < 1. We show that there exists a family of second-kind self-similar solutions with power-law behavior x^{-(1+\rho)} as x \to \infty with \rho \in (\gamma,1). To our knowledge this is the first example of a non-solvable kernel for which the existence of such a family has been established.
