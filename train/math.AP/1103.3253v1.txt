We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a compact manifold near an elliptic periodic geodesic. Using a geometric optics construction, we construct quasimodes to a nonlinear stationary problem which are highly localized near the periodic geodesic. We show the nonlinear Schr\"odinger evolution of such a quasimode remains localized near the geodesic, at least for short times.
