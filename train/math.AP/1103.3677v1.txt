We prove that a viscosity solution of a uniformly elliptic, fully nonlinear equation is C^{2,\alpha} on the compliment of a closed set of Hausdorff dimension at most \epsilon less than the dimension. The equation is assumed to be C^1, and the constant \epsilon > 0 depends only on the dimension and the ellipticity constants. The argument combines the W^{2,\epsilon} estimates of Lin with a result of Savin on the C^{2,\alpha} regularity of viscosity solutions which are close to quadratic polynomials.
