We prove some refined asymptotic estimates for postive blowing up solutions to \Delta u+\epsilon u=n(n-2)u^{\frac{n+2}{n-2}} on \Omega, \partial_\nu u=0 on \partial\Omega; \Omega being a smooth bounded domain of \rn, n\geq 3. In particular, we show that concentration can occur only on boundary points with nonpositive mean curvature when n=3 or n\geq 7. As a direct consequence, we prove the validity of the Lin-Ni's conjecture in dimension n=3 and n\geq 7 for mean convex domains and with bounded energy. Recent examples by Wang-Wei-Yan show that the bound on the energy is a necessary condition.
