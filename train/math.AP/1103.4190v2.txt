The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation with periodic boundary conditions is considered. It is shown that for H^s initial data, s>-1/2, and for any s_1<\min(3s+1,s+1), the difference of the nonlinear and linear evolutions is in H^{s_1} for all times, with at most polynomially growing H^{s_1} norm. The result also extends to KdV with a smooth, mean zero, time-dependent potential in the case s\geq 0. Our result and a theorem of Oskolkov for the Airy evolution imply that if one starts with continuous and bounded variation initial data then the solution of KdV (given by the L^2 theory of Bourgain) is a continuous function of space and time. In addition, we demonstrate smoothing for the modified KdV equation on the torus for s>1/2.
