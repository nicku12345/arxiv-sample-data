We discuss conditions for well-posedness of the scalar reaction-diffusion equation u_{t}=\Delta u+f(u) equipped with Dirichlet boundary conditions where the initial data is unbounded. Standard growth conditions are juxtaposed with the no-blow-up condition \int_{1}^{\infty}1/f(s) \d s=\infty that guarantees global solutions for the related ODE \dot u=f(u). We investigate well-posedness of the toy PDE u_{t}=f(u) in L^{p} under this no-blow-up condition. An example is given of a source term f and an initial condition \psi\in L^{2}(0,1) such that \int_{1}^{\infty}1/f(s)\d s=\infty and the toy PDE blows-up instantaneously while the reaction-diffusion equation is globally well-posed in L^{2}(0,1).
