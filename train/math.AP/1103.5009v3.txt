We study the inviscid limit problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on a half-plane with a Navier boundary condition depending on the viscosity. On one hand, we prove the L^2 convergence of Leray solutions to the solution of the Euler equation. On the other hand, we show the nonlinear instability of WKB expansions in the stronger L^{\infty} and \dot{H}^s (s>1) norms.
