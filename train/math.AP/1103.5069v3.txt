We prove Schauder estimates for a class of non-local elliptic operators with kernel K(y)=a(y)/|y|^{d+\sigma} and either Dini or H\"older continuous data. Here 0 < \sigma < 2 is a constant and a is a bounded measurable function, which is not necessarily to be homogeneous, regular, or symmetric. As an application, we prove that the operators give isomorphisms between the Lipschitz--Zygmund spaces \Lambda^{\alpha+\sigma} and \Lambda^\alpha for any \alpha>0. Several local estimates and an extension to operators with kernels K(x,y) are also discussed.
