On the one dimensional sphere, the support of the fundamental solution to the Schr\rm \ddot odinger equation consists of finite points at the time t\in 2\pi\Q.   The paper \cite{Ka} generalized this fact to compact symmetric spaces. In this paper, we consider similar results on Zoll manifolds. We study the singularity for a solution to the equation using a functional calculus of the self-adjoint operator with integer eigenvalues.
