We consider the minimizers of the energy  \|u\|_{H^s(\Omega)}^2+\int_\Omega W(u)\,dx, with s \in (0,1/2), where \|u\|_{H^s(\Omega)} denotes the total contribution from \Omega in the H^s norm of u, and W is a double-well potential. By using a fractional Sobolev inequality, we give a new proof of the fact that the sublevel sets of a minimizer u in a large ball B_R occupy a volume comparable with the volume of B_R.
