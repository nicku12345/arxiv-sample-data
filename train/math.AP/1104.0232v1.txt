In a previous article of Dos Santos Ferreira, Kenig, Salo and Uhlmann, anisotropic inverse problems were considered in certain admissible geometries, that is, on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary which are conformally embedded in a product of the Euclidean line and a simple manifold. In particular, it was proved that a bounded smooth potential in a Schr\"odinger equation was uniquely determined by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map in dimensions n \geq 3. In this article we extend this result to the case of unbounded potentials, namely those in Ln/2. In the process, we derive Lp Carleman estimates with limiting Carleman weights similar to the Euclidean estimates of Jerison-Kenig and Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge.
