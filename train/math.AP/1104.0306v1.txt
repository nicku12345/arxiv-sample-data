We develop a theory of existence and uniqueness for the following porous medium equation with fractional diffusion,  \{ll} \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t} + (-\Delta)^{\sigma/2} (|u|^{m-1}u)=0, & \qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^N,\; t>0, [8pt] u(x,0) = f(x), & \qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^N.%.  We consider data f\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) and all exponents 0<\sigma<2 and m>0. Existence and uniqueness of a weak solution is established for m> m_*=(N-\sigma)_+ /N, giving rise to an L^1-contraction semigroup. In addition, we obtain the main qualitative properties of these solutions. In the lower range 0<m\le m_* existence and uniqueness of solutions with good properties happen under some restrictions, and the properties are different from the case above m_*. We also study the dependence of solutions on f,m and \sigma. Moreover, we consider the above questions for the problem posed in a bounded domain.
