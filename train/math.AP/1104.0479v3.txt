For 0 < p-1 < q and \ge=\pm 1, we prove the existence of solutions of -\Gd_pu=\ge u^q in a cone C_S, with vertex 0 and opening S, vanishing on \prt C_S, under the form u(x)=|x|^\gb\gw(\frac{x}{|x|}). The problem reduces to a quasilinear elliptic equation on S and existence is based upon degree theory and homotopy methods. We also obtain a non-existence result in some critical case by an integral type identity.
