In this paper we derive, by means of \Gamma-convergence, the periodically wrinkled plate model starting from three dimensional nonlinear elasticity. We assume that the thickness of the plate is h^2 and that the mid-surface of the plate is given by (x_1,x_2) \to (x_1,x_2,h^2\theta(\per)), where \theta is [0,1]^2 periodic function. We also assume that the strain energy of the plate has the order h^8=(h^2)^4, which corresponds to the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an model in the case of the ordinary plate. The obtained model mixes the bending part of the energy with the stretching part.
