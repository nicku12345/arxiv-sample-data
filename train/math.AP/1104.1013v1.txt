Form methods give a very efficient tool to solve evolutionary problems on Hilbert space. They were developed by T. Kato [Kat] and, in slightly different language by J.L. Lions. In this expository article we give an introduction based on [AE2]. The main point in our approach is that the notion of closability is not needed anymore. The new setting is particularly efficient for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and degenerate equations. Besides this we give several other examples. This presentation starts by an introduction to holomorphic semigroups. Instead of the contour argument found in the literature, we give a more direct argument based on the Hille--Yosida theorem.
