We study qualitative properties of non-negative solutions to the Cauchy problem for the fast diffusion equation with gradient absorption \partial_t u -\Delta_{p}u+|\nabla u|^{q}=0\quad in\;\; (0,\infty)\times\RR^N, where N\ge 1, p\in(1,2), and q>0. Based on gradient estimates for the solutions, we classify the behavior of the solutions for large times, obtaining either positivity as t\to\infty for q>p-N/(N+1), optimal decay estimates as t\to\infty for p/2\le q\le p-N/(N+1), or extinction in finite time for 0 < q < p/2. In addition, we show how the diffusion prevents extinction in finite time in some ranges of exponents where extinction occurs for the non-diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
