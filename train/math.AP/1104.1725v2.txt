We study existence, unicity and other geometric properties of the minimizers of the energy functional  \|u\|^2_{H^s(\Omega)}+\int_\Omega W(u)\,dx,  where \|u\|_{H^s(\Omega)} denotes the total contribution from \Omega in the H^s norm of u and W is a double-well potential. We also deal with the solutions of the related fractional elliptic Allen-Cahn equation on the entire space \mathbb{R}^n.   The results collected here will also be useful for forthcoming papers, where the second and the third author will study the \Gamma-convergence and the density estimates for level sets of minimizers.
