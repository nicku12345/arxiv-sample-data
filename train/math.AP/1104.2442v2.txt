In this paper, a two-dimensional model for the growth of multi-layer tumors is presented. The model consists of a free boundary problem for the tumor cell membrane and the tumor is supposed to grow or shrink due to cell proliferation or cell dead. The growth process is caused by a diffusing nutrient concentration \sigma and is controlled by an internal cell pressure p. We assume that the tumor occupies a strip-like domain with a fixed boundary at y=0 and a free boundary y=\rho(x), where \rho is a 2\pi-periodic function. First, we prove the existence of solutions (\sigma,p,\rho) and that the model allows for peculiar stationary solutions. As a main result we establish that these equilibrium points are locally asymptotically stable under small perturbations.
