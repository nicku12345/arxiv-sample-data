In this paper, under the hypothesis that \rho is upper bounded, we construct a Lyapunov functional for the multidimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations and show that the weak solutions decay exponentially to the equilibrium state in L^2 norm. This can be regarded as a generalization of Matsumura and Nishida's results in 1982, since our analysis is done in the framework of Lions 1998 and Feireisl et al. 2001, the higher regularity of (\rho, u) and the uniformly positive lower bound of \rho are not necessary in our analysis and vacuum may be admitted. Indeed, the upper bound of the density \rho plays the essential role in our proof.
