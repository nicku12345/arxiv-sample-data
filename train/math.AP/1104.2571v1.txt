In this article we provide numerical and analytical evidence that some degenerate dispersive partial differential equations are ill-posed. Specifically we study the K(2,2) equation u_t = (u^2)_{xxx} + (u^2)_{x} and the "degenerate Airy" equation u_t = 2 u u_{xxx}. For K(2,2) our results are computational in nature: we conduct a series of numerical simulations which demonstrate that data which is very small in H^2 can be of unit size at a fixed time which is independent of the data's size. For the degenerate Airy equation, our results are fully rigorous: we prove the existence of a compactly supported self-similar solution which, when combined with certain scaling invariances, implies ill-posedness (also in H^2).
