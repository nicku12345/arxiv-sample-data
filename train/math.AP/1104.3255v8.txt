In this paper we establish a new uniqueness result of weak solutions for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. Under assumption that there is not uniqueness of weak solution in singular time, we prove that if two weak solutions u and v of 3D Navier-Stokes equations belong to L^{\frac{5}{2}}\left( 0,T;V\right)  with the same initial datum, then we get u=v. In the class L^{3}\left( 0,T;V\right) , we prove that u-v\in C^{0}\left( 0,T;H\right)  and u=v\ when u_{0}=v_{0}.
