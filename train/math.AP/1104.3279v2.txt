In this paper, we discuss an initial boundary value problem for the stochastic wave equation involving the nonlinear damping term |u_t|^{q-2}u_t and a source term of the type |u|^{p-2}u. We firstly establish the local existence and uniqueness of solution by the Galerkin approximation method and show that the solution is global for q\geq p. Secondly, by an appropriate energy inequality, the local solution of the stochastic equations will blow up with positive probability or explosive in energy sense for p>q.
