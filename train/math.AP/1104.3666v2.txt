We study the Emden-Fowler equation -\Delta u=|u|^{p-1}u on the hyperbolic space {\mathbb H}^n. We are interested in radial solutions, namely solutions depending only on the geodesic distance from a given point. The critical exponent for such equation is p=(n+2)/(n-2) as in the Euclidean setting, but the properties of the solutions show striking differences with the Euclidean case. While the papers \cite{mancini, bhakta} consider finite energy solutions, we shall deal here with infinite energy solutions and we determine the exact asymptotic behavior of wide classes of finite and infinite energy solutions.
