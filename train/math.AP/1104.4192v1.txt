In this paper we consider a coupled hydrodynamical system which involves the Navier-Stokes equations for the velocity field and kinematic transport equations for the molecular orientation field. By applying the Chemin-Lerner's time-space estimates for the heat equation and the Fourier localization technique, we prove that when initial data belongs to the critical Besov spaces with negative-order, there exists a unique local solution, and this solution is global when initial data is small enough. As a corollary, we obtain existence of global self-similar solutions. In order to figure out the relation between the solution obtained here and weak solution of standard sense, we establish a stability result, which yields in a direct way that all global weak solutions associated with the same initial data must coincide with the solution obtained here, namely, weak-strong uniqueness holds.
