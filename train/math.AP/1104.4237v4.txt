We study the following Helmholtz equation  (\nabla +iA(x))^{2} u+ V_{1}(x) u + V_{2}(x) u + \lambda u = f(x)  in \mathbb{R}^d with magnetic and electric potentials that are singular at the origin and decay at infinity. We prove the existence of a unique solution satisfying a suitable Sommerfeld radiation condition, together with some a priori estimates. We use the limiting absorption method and a multiplier technique of Morawetz type.
