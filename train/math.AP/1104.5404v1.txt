In this paper we prove that the motion of a solid body in a two dimensional incompressible perfect fluid converges, when the body shrinks to a point with fixed mass and circulation, to a variant of the vortex-wave system where the vortex, placed in the point occupied by the shrunk body, is accelerated by a lift force similar to the Kutta-Joukowski force of the irrotational theory.
