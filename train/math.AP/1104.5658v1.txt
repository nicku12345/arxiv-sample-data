We show a large time behavior result for class of weakly coupled systems of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the periodic setting. We use a PDE approach to extend the convergence result proved by Namah and Roquejoffre (1999) in the scalar case. Our proof is based on new comparison, existence and regularity results for systems. An interpretation of the solution of the system in terms of an optimal control problem with switching is given.
