In this paper we deal with a class of inequalities which interpolate the Kato's inequality and the Hardy's inequality in the half space. Starting from the classical Hardy's inequality in the half space \rnpiu =\R^{n-1}\times(0,\infty), we show that, if we replace the optimal constant \frac{(n-2)^2}{4} with a smaller one \frac{(\beta-2)^2}{4}, 2\le \beta <n, then we can add an extra trace-term equals to that one that appears in the Kato's inequality. The constant in the trace remainder term is optimal and it tends to zero when \beta goes to n, while it is equal to the optimal constant in the Kato's inequality when \beta=2.
