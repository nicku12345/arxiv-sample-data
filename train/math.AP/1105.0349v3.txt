The introduced notion of locally-periodic two-scale convergence allows to average a wider range of microstructures, compared to the periodic one. The compactness theorem for the locally-periodic two-scale convergence and the characterisation of the limit for a sequence bounded in H^1(\Omega) are proven. The underlying analysis comprises the approximation of functions, which periodicity with respect to the fast variable depends on the slow variable, by locally-periodic functions, periodic in subdomains smaller than the considered domain, but larger than the size of microscopic structures. The developed theory is applied to derive macroscopic equations for a linear elasticity problem defined in domains with plywood structures.
