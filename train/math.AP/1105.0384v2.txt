We consider the Dirichlet problem for stationary biharmonic maps u from a bounded, smooth domain \Omega\subset\mathbb R^n (n\ge 5) to a compact, smooth Riemannian manifold N\subset\mathbb R^l without boundary. For any smooth boundary data, we show that if, in addition, u satisfies a certain boundary monotonicity inequality, then there exists a closed subset \Sigma\subset\bar{\Omega}, with H^{n-4}(\Sigma)=0, such that u\in C^\infty(\bar\Omega\setminus\Sigma, N).
