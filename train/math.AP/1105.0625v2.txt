In this paper, the Lie symmetry method is performed for the nonlinear evolution equation for description nonlinear waves in a viscoelastic tube. we will find one and two-dimensional optimal system of Lie subalgebras. Furthermore, preliminary classification of its group-invariant solutions are investigated.
