The low Mach number limit for the multi-dimensional full magnetohydrodynamic equations, in which the effect of thermal conduction is taken into account, is rigorously justified in the framework of classical solutions with small density and temperature variations. Moreover, we show that for sufficiently small Mach number, the compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations admit a smooth solution on the time interval where the smooth solution of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations exists. In addition, the low Mach number limit for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations with small entropy variation is also investigated. The convergence rates are obtained in both cases.
