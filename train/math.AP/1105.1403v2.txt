We consider an active scalar equation that is motivated by a model for magneto-geostrophic dynamics and the geodynamo. We prove that the non-diffusive equation is ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard in Sobolev spaces. In contrast, the critically diffusive equation is well-posed. In this case we give an example of a steady state that is nonlinearly unstable, and hence produces a dynamo effect in the sense of an exponentially growing magnetic field.
