The theory of plasma physics offers a number of nontrivial examples of partial differential equations, which can be successfully treated with symmetry methods. We propose the Grad-Shafranov equation which may illustrate the reciprocal advantage of this interaction between plasma physics and symmetry techniques. A symmetry classification of the Grad-Shafranov equation with two arbitrary functions F(u) and G(u) of the unknown variable u=u(x,t) is given. The optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras is performed. This latter provides a process for building new solutions for the equation.
