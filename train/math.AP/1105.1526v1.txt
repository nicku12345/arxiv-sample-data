We study weak solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations in whole space with L^2 initial data. It will be proved that \nabla^\alpha u  is locally integrable in space-time for any real \alpha such that 1< \alpha <3, which says that almost third derivative is locally integrable. Up to now, only second derivative \nabla^2 u has been known to be locally integrable by standard parabolic regularization. We also present sharp estimates of those quantities in weak-L_{loc}^{4/(\alpha+1)}. These estimates depend only on the L^2 norm of initial data and integrating domains. Moreover, they are valid even for \alpha\geq 3 as long as u is smooth. The proof uses a good approximation of Navier-Stokes and a blow-up technique, which let us to focusing on a local study. For the local study, we use De Giorgi method with a new pressure decomposition. To handle non-locality of the fractional Laplacian, we will adopt some properties of the Hardy space and Maximal functions.
