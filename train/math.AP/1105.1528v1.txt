Motivated by Ruf-Sani's recent work, we prove an Adams type inequality and a singular Adams type inequality in the whole four dimensional Euclidean space. As applications of those inequalities, a class of elliptic partial differential equations are considered. Existence of nontrivial weak solutions and multiplicity results are obtained via the mountain-pass theorem and the Ekeland's variational principle. This is a continuation of our previous work about singular Trudinger-Moser type inequality.
