We consider populations structured by a phenotypic trait and a space variable, in a non-homogeneous environment. In the case of sex- ual populations, we are able to derive models close to existing mod- els in theoretical biology, from a structured population model. We then analyze the dynamics of the population using a simplified model, where the population either propagates through the whole space or it survives but remains confined in a limited range. For asexual pop- ulations, we show that the dynamics are simpler. In this case, the population cannot remain confined in a limited range, i.e. the popu- lation, if it does not get extinct, propagates through the whole space.
