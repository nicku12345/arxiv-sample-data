We study the motion of an inextensible string (a whip) fixed at one point in the absence of gravity, satisfying the equations  \eta_{tt} = \partial_s(\sigma \eta_s), \qquad \sigma_{ss}-\lvert \eta_{ss}\rvert^2 = -\lvert \eta_{st}\rvert^2, \qquad \lvert \eta_s\rvert^2 \equiv 1  with boundary conditions \eta(t,1)=0 and \sigma(t,0)=0. We prove local existence and uniqueness in the space defined by the weighted Sobolev energy  \sum_{\ell=0}^m \int_0^1 s^{\ell} \lvert \partial_s^{\ell}\eta_t\rvert^2 \, ds + \int_0^1 s^{\ell+1} \lvert \partial_s^{\ell+1}\eta\rvert^2 \, ds,  when m\ge 3. In addition we show persistence of smooth solutions as long as the energy for m=3 remains bounded. We do this via the method of lines, approximating with a discrete system of coupled pendula (a chain) for which the same estimates hold.
