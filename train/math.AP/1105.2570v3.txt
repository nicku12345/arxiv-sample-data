In this paper we obtain the existence of bounded positive entire radial solutions for the following nonlinear elliptic problem with a special nonlinear gradient term   -\triangle_{p}u-b(x)|\nablau|^{p-1}=a(x)f(u), x\inR^{N} (N\geq3), lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty}u(x)=0, where \triangle_{p}u=div[big]<LaTeX>\big(</LaTeX>|\nablau|^{p-2}\nablau[big]<LaTeX>\big)</LaTeX>, 1<p<N, a(x)=a(|x|), b(x)=b(|x|) which are continuous, and f\inC^1(0,\infty) which may be singular at zero.
