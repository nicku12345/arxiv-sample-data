We study the cancelations in the energy estimates for Einstein vacuum equations in order to prove the formation of black holes along evolutions. The novelty of the paper is that, we completely avoid using rotation vector fields to establish the global existence theorem of the solution. More precisely, we use only canonical null directions as commutators to derive energy estimates at the level of one derivatives of null curvature components.
