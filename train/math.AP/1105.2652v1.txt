In this article we consider the system of equations {\Delta}u_{i}=p_{i}(x)f_{i}(u_{1},...,u_{d}) for i=1,...,d on R^{N}, N\geq3 and d\in{1,2,3,4,...}. We prove that the considered system has a bounded positive entire solution under some conditions on p_{i} and f_{i}. Also, we give a necessary condition as well as a sufficient condition for a positive radial solution to be large. The method of proving theorems is essentially based on a successive approximation. Furthermore, a non-radially symmetric solution is obtained by using a lower and upper solution method.
