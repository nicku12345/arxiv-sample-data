We consider the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear nonlocal flows u_t+(-\La)^{1/2}u=0 to find the geometric property of the solutions in nonlinear eigenvalue problem: (-\La)^{1/2}\vp=\lambda\vp posed in a strictly convex domain \Omega\subset\R^n with \vp>0 in \Omega and \vp=0 on \R^n\bs\Omega. This is corresponding to an eigenvalue problem for Cauchy process. The concavity of \vp is well known for the dimension n=1. In this paper, we will show \vp^{-\frac{2}{n+1}} is convex. Moreover, the eventual power-convexity of the parabolic flows is also proved. In the final section, We extend geometric results to Cauchy problem for the fractional Heat operator.
