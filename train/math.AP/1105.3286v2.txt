In this paper, we establish local H\"older estimate for non-negative solutions of the singular equation \eqref{eq-nlocal-PME-1} below, for m in the range of exponents (\frac{n-2\sigma}{n+2\sigma},1). Since we have trouble in finding the local energy inequality of v directly. we use the fact that the operator (-\La)^{\sigma} can be thought as the normal derivative of some extension v^{\ast} of v to the upper half space, \cite{CS}, i.e., v is regarded as boundary value of v^{\ast} the solution of some local extension problem. Therefore, the local H\"older estimate of v can be obtained by the same regularity of v^{\ast}. In addition, it enables us to describe the behaviour of solution of non-local fast diffusion equation near their extinction time.
