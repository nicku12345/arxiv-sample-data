We establish a new a priori bound for  L^2 -bounded sequences of solutions to the mKdV equations on the torus. This first enable us to construct weak solutions in  L^2 for this equation and to check that the "solutions" constructed by Kappeler and Topalov in the defocusing case satisfy the equation in some weak sense. In a second time, we prove that the solution-map associated with the mKdV and the KdV equation are discontinuous for the  H^s(\T)  topology for respectively  s<0 and  s<-1. These last results are sharp.
