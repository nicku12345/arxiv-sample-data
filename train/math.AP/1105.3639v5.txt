In this paper we study the uniqueness property of solutions to the steady incompressible Euler equations with perturbations in \Bbb R^N. Our perturbations include as special cases the Euler equations with a `single signed' nonlinear term, the self-similar Euler equations, and the steady Navier-Stokes equations. For these equations show that suitable decay assumptions at infinity on the solution or its derivatives, imposed by the L^q conditions imply that the only possible solution is zero.
