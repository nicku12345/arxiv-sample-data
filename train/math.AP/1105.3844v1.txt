In this paper we study existence of solutions for the Cauchy problem of the Debye-H\"{u}ckel system with low regularity initial data. By using the Chemin-Lerner time-space estimate for the heat equation, we prove that there exists a unique local solution if the initial data belongs to the Besov space \dot{B}^{s}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) for -3/2<s\leq-2+\frac{n}{2}, p=\frac{n}{s+2} and 1\leq q\leq \infty, and furthermore, if the initial data is sufficiently small then the solution is global. This result improves the regularity index of the initial data space in previous results on this model.
