This paper deals with variational principles on thin films subject to linear PDE constraints represented by a constant-rank operator \mathcal{A}. We study the effective behavior of integral functionals as the thickness of the domain tends to zero, investigating both upper and lower bounds for the \Gamma-limit. Under certain conditions we show that the limit is an integral functional and give an explicit formula. The limit functional turns out to be constrained to \mathcal{A}_0-free vector fields, where the limit operator \mathcal{A}_0 is in general not of constant rank. This result extends work by Bouchitte, Fonseca and Mascarenhas [J. Convex Anal. 16 (2009), pp. 351--365] to the setting of \mathcal{A}-free vector fields. While the lower bound follows from a Young measure approach together with a new decomposition lemma, the construction of a recovery sequence relies on algebraic considerations in Fourier space. This part of the argument requires a careful analysis of the limiting behavior of the rescaled operators \mathcal{A}_\epsilon by a suitable convergence of their symbols, as well as an explicit construction for plane waves inspired by the bending moment formulas in the theory of (linear) elasticity. We also give a few applications to common operators \mathcal{A}.
