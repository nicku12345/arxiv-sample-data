By employing Aronsson's Absolute Minimizers of L^\infty functionals, we prove that Absolutely Minimizing Maps u:\R^n \larrow \R^N solve a "tangential" Aronsson PDE system. By following Sheffield-Smart \cite{SS}, we derive \De_\infty with respect to the dual operator norm and show that such maps miss information along a hyperplane when compared to Tight Maps. We recover the lost term which causes non-uniqueness and derive the complete Aronsson system which has \emph{discontinuous coefficients}. In particular, the Euclidean \infty-Laplacian is \De_\infty u = Du \ot Du : D^2u\, +\, |Du|^2[Du]^\bot \De u where [Du]^\bot is the projection on the null space of Du^\top. We exibit C^\infty solutions having interfaces along which the rank of their gradient is discontinuous and propose a modification with C^0 coefficients which admits \emph{varifold solutions}. Away from the interfaces, Aronsson Maps satisfy a structural property of local splitting to 2 phases, an horizontal and a vertical; horizontally they possess gradient flows similar to the scalar case and vertically solve a linear system coupled by a scalar Hamilton Jacobi PDE. We also construct singular \infty-Harmonic local C^1 diffeomorphisms and singular Aronsson Maps.
