By a refinement of the technique used by Johnson and Zumbrun to show stability under localized perturbations, we show that spectral stability implies nonlinear modulational stability of periodic traveling-wave solutions of reaction diffusion systems under small perturbations consisting of a nonlocalized modulation plus a localized perturbation. The main new ingredient is a detailed analysis of linear behavior under modulational data \bar u'(x)h_0(x), where \bar u is the background profile and h_0 is the initial modulation
