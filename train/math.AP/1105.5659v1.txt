We prove global well-posedness for a cubic, non-local Schr\"odinger equation with radially-symmetric initial data in the critical space L^2(\R^2), using the framework of Kenig-Merle and Killip-Tao-Visan. As a consequence, we obtain a global well-posedness result for Schr\"odinger maps from \R^2 into \S^2 (Landau-Lifshitz equation) with radially symmetric initial data (with no size restriction).
