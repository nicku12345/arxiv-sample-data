Given a symmetric Riemannian manifold (M, g), we show some results of genericity for non degenerate sign changing solutions of singularly perturbed nonlinear elliptic problems with respect to the parameters: the positive number {\epsilon} and the symmetric metric g. Using these results we obtain a lower bound on the number of non degenerate solutions which change sign exactly once.
