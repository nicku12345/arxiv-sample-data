Recently, Giorgio Fusco and the author studied the system {\Delta}u - W_u (u) = 0 for a class of potentials that possess several global minima and are invariant under a general finite reflection group, and established existence of equivariant solutions connecting the minima in certain directions at infinity, together with an estimate. In this paper a new proof is given which, in particular, avoids the introduction of a pointwise constraint in the minimization process.
