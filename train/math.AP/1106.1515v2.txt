In this paper we prove Liouville type result for the stationary solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations(NSP) and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations(NS) in \Bbb R^N, N\geq 2. Assuming suitable integrability and the uniform boundedness conditions for the solutions we are led to the conclusion that v=0. In the case of (NS) we deduce that the similar integrability conditions imply v=0 and \rho=constant on \Bbb R^N. This shows that if we impose the the non-vacuum boundary condition at spatial infinity for (NS), v\to 0 and \rho\to \rho_\infty >0, then v=0, \rho=\rho_\infty are the solutions.
