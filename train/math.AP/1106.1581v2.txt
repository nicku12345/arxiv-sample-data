In the present work, we address a class of Cahn-Hilliard equations characterized by a nonlinear diffusive dynamics and possibly containing an additional sixth order term. This model describes the separation properties of oil-water mixtures, when a substance enforcing the mixing of the phases (a surfactant) is added. However, the model is also closely connected with other Cahn-Hilliard-type equations relevant in different types of applications. We first discuss the existence of a weak solution to the sixth-order model in the case when the configuration potential of the system is of singular (e.g., logarithmic) type. Then, we study the behavior of the solutions in the case when the sixth order term is let tend to 0, proving convergence to solutions of the fourth order system in a special case. The fourth order system is then investigated by a direct approach and existence of a weak solution is shown under very general conditions by means of a fixed point argument. Finally, additional properties of the solutions, like uniqueness and parabolic regularization are discussed, both for the sixth order and for the fourth order model, under more restrictive assumptions on the nonlinear diffusion term.
