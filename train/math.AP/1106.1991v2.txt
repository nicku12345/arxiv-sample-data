An entire solution of the Allen-Cahn equation \Delta u=F'(u), where F is an even, bistable function, is called a 2k-end solution if its nodal set is asymptotic to 2k half lines, and if along each of these half lines the function u looks like the one dimensional, heteroclinic solution. In this paper we initiate a program to classify the four-end solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation in \R^2. We show that there exists a one parameter family of solutions containing the saddle solution, for which the angle between the nodal lines is \frac{\pi}{2}, as well as solutions for which the angle between the asymptotic half lines is any \theta\in (0, \frac{\pi}{2}). This justifies the definition of the angle map for a four-end solution u, which is the angle \theta=\theta(u)\in (0, \frac{\pi}{2}) between the asymptote to the nodal line in the first quadrant and the x axis. Then we show that on any connected component in the moduli space of four-end solutions the angle map is surjective onto (0,\frac{\pi}{2}).
