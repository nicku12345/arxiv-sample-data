We exhibit smooth initial data for the 2D water wave equation for which we prove that smoothness of the interface breaks down in finite time. Moreover, we show a stability result together with numerical evidence that there exist solutions of the 2D water wave equation that start from a graph, turn over and collapse in a splash singularity (self intersecting curve in one point) in finite time.
