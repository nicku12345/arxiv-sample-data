We use a nonlocal maximum principle to prove the global existence of smooth solutions for a slightly supercritical surface quasi-geostrophic equation. By this we mean that the velocity field u is obtained from the active scalar \theta by a Fourier multiplier with symbol i k^\perp |k|^{-1} m(k|), where m is a smooth increasing function that grows slower than \log \log |k| as |k|\rightarrow \infty.
