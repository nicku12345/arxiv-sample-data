In this paper we study the Euler-Poincar\'{e} equations in \Bbb R^N. We prove local existence of weak solutions in W^{2,p}(\Bbb R^N), p>N, and local existence of unique classical solutions in H^k (\Bbb R^N), k>N/2+3, as well as a blow-up criterion. For the zero dispersion equation(\alpha=0) we prove a finite time blow-up of the classical solution. We also prove that as the dispersion parameter vanishes, the weak solution converges to a solution of the zero dispersion equation with sharp rate as \alpha\to0, provided that the limiting solution belongs to C([0, T);H^k(\Bbb R^N)) with k>N/2 +3. For the {\em stationary weak solutions} of the Euler-Poincar\'{e} equations we prove a Liouville type theorem. Namely, for \alpha>0 any weak solution \mathbf{u}\in H^1(\Bbb R^N) is \mathbf{u}=0; for \alpha=0 any weak solution \mathbf{u}\in L^2(\Bbb R^N) is \mathbf{u}=0.
