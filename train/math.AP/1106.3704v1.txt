The paper is concerned with the vanishing viscosity limit of the two-dimensional degenerate viscous lake equations when the Navier slip conditions are prescribed on the impermeable boundary of a simply connected bounded regular domain. When the initial vorticity is in the Lebesgue space L^q with 2<q\le\infty, we show the degenerate viscous lake equations possess a unique global solution and the solution converges to a corresponding weak solution of the inviscid lake equations. In the special case when the vorticity is in L^\infty, an explicit convergence rate is obtained.
