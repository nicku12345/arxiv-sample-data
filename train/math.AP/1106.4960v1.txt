Let L= -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}^n}+V be a Schr\"odinger operator on the Heisenberg group \mathbb{H}^n, where \Delta_{\mathbb{H}^n} is the sub-Laplacian and the nonnegative potential V belongs to the reverse H\"older class B_{\frac{Q}{2}} and Q is the homogeneous dimension of \mathbb{H}^n. The Riesz transforms associated with the Schr\"odinger operator L are bounded from L^1(\mathbb{H}^n) to L^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{H}^n). The L^1 integrability of the Riesz transforms associated with L characterizes a certain Hardy type space denoted by H^1_L(\mathbb{H}^n) which is larger than the usual Hardy space H^1(\mathbb{H}^n). We define H^1_L(\mathbb{H}^n) in terms of the maximal function with respect to the semigroup \big \{e^{-s L}:\; s>0 \big\}, and give the atomic decomposition of H^1_L(\mathbb{H}^n). As an application of the atomic decomposition theorem, we prove that H^1_L(\mathbb{H}^n) can be characterized by the Riesz transforms associated with L. All results hold for stratified groups as well.
