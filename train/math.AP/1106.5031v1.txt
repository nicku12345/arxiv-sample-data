We investigate the structure of nematic liquid crystal thin films described by the Landau--de Gennes tensor-valued order parameter with Dirichlet boundary conditions of nonzero degree. We prove that as the elasticity constant goes to zero a limiting uniaxial texture forms with disclination lines corresponding to a finite number of defects, all of degree 1/2 or all of degree -1/2. We also state a result on the limiting behavior of minimizers of the Chern-Simons-Higgs model without magnetic field that follows from a similar proof.
