We consider the quasilinear parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system    u_t=\nabla \cdot (D(u)\nabla u) - \nabla \cdot (S(u)\nabla v),   \qquad x\in\Omega, \ t>0,   v_t=\Delta v -v + u,   x\in\Omega, \ t>0,  under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a smooth bounded domain \Omega\subset\R^n with n\ge 2. It is proved that if \frac{S(u)}{D(u)}\le cu^{\alpha} with \alpha<\frac{2}{n} and some constant c>0 for all u>1 and some further technical conditions are fulfilled, then the classical solutions to the above system are uniformly-in-time bounded. This boundedness result is optimal according to a recent result by the second author ({\em Math. Meth. Appl. Sci.} {\bf 33} (2010), 12-24), which says that if \frac{S(u)}{D(u)} \ge cu^\alpha for u>1 with c>0 and some \alpha>\frac{2}{n}, then for each mass M>0 there exist blow-up solutions with mass \io u_0=M. In addition, this paper also proves a general boundedness result for quasilinear non-uniformly parabolic equations by modifying the iterative technique of Moser-Alikakos (Alikakos, {\em Comm. PDE} {\bf 4} (1979), 827-868).
