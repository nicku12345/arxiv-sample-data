We provide a precise description of the set of residual boundary conditions generated by the self-similar viscous approximation introduced by Dafermos et al. We then apply our results, valid for both conservative and non conservative systems, to the analysis of the boundary Riemann problem and we show that, under appropriate assumptions, the limits of the self-similar and the classical vanishing viscosity approximation coincide. We require neither genuinely nonlinearity nor linear degeneracy of the characteristic fields.
