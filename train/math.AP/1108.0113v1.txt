We prove L^\infty bounds and estimates of the modulus of continuity of solutions to the Poisson problem for the normalized infinity and p-Laplacian, namely \[ -\Delta_p^N u=f\qquad\text{for n<p\leq\infty.} \] We are able to provide a stable family of results depending continuously on the parameter p. We also prove the failure of the classical Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate for the normalized infinity Laplacian and propose alternate estimates.
