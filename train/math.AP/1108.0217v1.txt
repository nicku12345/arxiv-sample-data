We study the global attractors of abstract semilinear parabolic equations and their projections to finite-dimensional planes. It is well-known that the attractor can be embedded into the finite-dimensional inertial manifold if the so-called spectral gap condition is satisfied. We show that in the case when the spectral gap condition is violated, it is possible to construct the nonlinearity in such way that the corresponding attractor cannot be embedded into any finite-dimensional Log-Lipschitz manifold and, therefore, does not possess any Mane projections with Log-Lipschitz inverse. In addition, we give an example of finitely smooth nonlinearity such that the attractor has finite Hausdorff but infinite fractal dimension.
