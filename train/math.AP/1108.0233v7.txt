In his big regularity paper, Almgren has proven the regularity theorem for mass-minimizing integral currents. One key step in his paper is to derive the regularity of Dirichlet-minimizing \mathbf{Q}_{Q}(\mathbb{R}^{n})-valued functions in the Sobolev space \mathcal{Y}_{2}(\Omega, \mathbf{Q}_{Q} (\mathbb{R}^{n})), where the domain \Omega is open in \mathbb{R}^{m}. In this article, we introduce the class of weakly stationary-harmonic \mathbf{Q}_{Q} (\mathbb{R}^n)-valued functions. These functions are the critical points of Dirichlet integral under smooth domain-variations and range-variations. We prove that if \Omega is a two-dimensional domain in \mathbb{R}^{2} and f\in\mathcal{Y}_{2}(\Omega,\mathbf{Q}_{Q}(\mathbb{R}^{n})) is weakly stationary-harmonic, then f is continuous in the interior of the domain \Omega.
