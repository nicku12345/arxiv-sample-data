In this paper, we study the scattering for the nonlinear beam equation u_{tt}+\Delta^2u+mu+\mu |u|^{p-1}u=0. Our results include two aspects. In the defocusing case we show that the scattering holds for d=1, which extends the result in \cite{Pau-Beam} to one dimension. In the focusing case, we show that the scattering holds in \R^d (d\ge 1) when the energy E(u_0,u_1)<E(R,0) and \|\Delta u_0\|_{L^2}^2+m\|u_0\|_{L^2}^2<\|\Delta R\|_{L^2}^2+m\|R\|_{L^2}^2 for ground state R. The difficulties lie the absence of the scaling invariance and a Galilean transformation for the equation to control the Momentum vector.
