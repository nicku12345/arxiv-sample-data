We consider the Hardy-H\'enon system -\Delta u =|x|^a v^p, -\Delta v =|x|^b u^q with p,q>0 and a,b\in {\mathbb R} and we are concerned in particular with the Liouville property, i.e. the nonexistence of positive solutions in the whole space {\mathbb R}^N. In view of known results, it is a natural conjecture that this property should be true if and only if (N+a)/(p+1)+ (N+b)/(q+1)>N-2. In this paper, we prove the conjecture for dimension N=3 in the case of bounded solutions and in dimensions N\le 4 when a,b\le 0, among other partial nonexistence results. As far as we know, this is the first optimal Liouville type result for the Hardy-H\'enon system. Next, as applications, we give results on singularity and decay estimates as well as a priori bounds of positive solutions.
