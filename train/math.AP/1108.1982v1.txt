Generalizing the well-known mean-value property of harmonic functions, we prove that a p-harmonic function of two variables satisfies, in a viscosity sense, two asymptotic formulas involving its local statistics. Moreover, we show that these asymptotic formulas characterize p-harmonic functions when 1 < p < \infty. An example demonstrates that, in general, these formulas do not hold in a non-asymptotic sense.
