This paper discusses an improved smoothing phenomena for low-regularity solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the periodic settings by means of normal form transformation. As a result, the solution map from a ball on H^{-1/2+} to C_0^t ([0,T], H^{-1/2+}) can be shown to be Lipschitz in a H^{0+}_x topology, where the Lipschitz constant only depends on the rough norm \|u_0\|_{H^{-1/2+}} of the initial data. A similar episode has been observed in a recent paper on 1D quadratic Schr\"odinger equation in low-regularity setting.
