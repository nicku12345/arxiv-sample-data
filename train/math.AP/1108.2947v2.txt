Let (g^{\alpha\beta}(x)) and (h_{ij}(u)) be uniformly elliptic symmetric matrices, and assume that h_{ij}(u) and p(x) \, (\, \geq 2) are sufficiently smooth. We prove partial regularity of minimizers for the functional [   {\mathcal F}(u) = \int_\Omega (g^{\alpha \beta}(x) h_{ij}(u)   D_\alpha u^iD_\beta u^j)^{p(x)/2} dx, \] under the non-standard growth conditions of p(x)-type. If g^{\alpha\beta}(x) are in the class VMO, we have partial H\"older regularity. Moreover, if g^{\alpha\beta} are H\"older continuous, we can show partial C^{1,\alpha}-regularity.
