We are interested in the existence versus non-existence of non-trivial stable sub- and super-solutions of {equation} \label{pop} -div(\omega_1 \nabla u) = \omega_2 f(u) \qquad \text{in}\ \ \IR^N, {equation} with positive smooth weights  \omega_1(x),\omega_2(x). We consider the cases  f(u) = e^u, u^p where p>1 and  -u^{-p} where  p>0. We obtain various non-existence results which depend on the dimension N and also on  p and the behaviour of  \omega_1,\omega_2 near infinity. Also the monotonicity of  \omega_1 is involved in some results. Our methods here are the methods developed by Farina, \cite{f2}. We examine a specific class of weights  \omega_1(x) = (|x|^2 +1)^\frac{\alpha}{2} and  \omega_2(x) = (|x|^2+1)^\frac{\beta}{2} g(x) where  g(x) is a positive function with a finite limit at  \infty. For this class of weights non-existence results are optimal. To show the optimality we use various generalized Hardy inequalities.
