The forced and weakly damped Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation with periodic boundary conditions is considered. Starting from L^2 and mean-zero initial data we prove that the solution decomposes into two parts; a linear one which decays to zero as time goes to infinity and a nonlinear one which always belongs to a smoother space. As a corollary we prove that all solutions are attracted by a ball in H^s, s\in(0,1), whose radius depends only on s, the L^2 norm of the forcing term and the damping parameter. This gives a new proof for the existence of a smooth global attractor and provides quantitative information on the size of the attractor set in H^s.
