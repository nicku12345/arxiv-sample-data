We consider the generalized two-dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation u_t+\partial_x \Delta u+\partial_x(u^{k+1})=0, where k\geq3 is an integer number. For k\geq8 we prove local well-posedness in the L^2-based Sobolev spaces H^s(\mathbb{R}^2), where s is greater than the critical scaling index s_k=1-2/k. For k\geq 3 we also establish a sharp criteria to obtain global H^1(\R^2) solutions. A nonlinear scattering result in H^1(\R^2) is also established assuming the initial data is small and belongs to a suitable Lebesgue space.
