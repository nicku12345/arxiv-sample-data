We prove the existence of a family of slow decay positive solutions of a supercritical elliptic equation with Hardy potential in the entire space and study stability and oscillation properties of these solutions. We also establish the existence of a continuum of stable slow decay positive solutions for the relevant exterior Dirichlet problem.
