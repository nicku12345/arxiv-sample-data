We show that near any given minimizing sequence of paths for the mountain pass lemma, there exists a critical point whose polarization is also a critical point. This is motivated by the fact that if any polarization of a critical point is also a critical point and the Euler-Lagrange equation is a second-order semi-linear elliptic problem, T. Bartsch, T. Weth and M. Willem (J. Anal. Math., 2005) have proved that the critical point is axially symmetric.
