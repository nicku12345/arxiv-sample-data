The formation of singularity and breakdown of classical solutions to the three-dimensional compressible viscoelasticity and inviscid elasticity are considered. For the compressible inviscid elastic fluids, the finite-time formation of singularity in classical solutions is proved for certain initial data. For the compressible viscoelastic fluids, a criterion in term of the temporal integral of the velocity gradient is obtained for the breakdown of smooth solutions.
