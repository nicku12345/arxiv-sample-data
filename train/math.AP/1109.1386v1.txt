We consider the stationary nonlinear magnetic Choquard equation [(-\mathrm{i}\nabla+A(x))^{2}u+V(x)u=(\frac{1}{|x|^{\alpha}}\ast |u|^{p}) |u|^{p-2}u,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}%] where A\ is a real valued vector potential, V is a real valued scalar potential, N\geq3, \alpha\in(0,N) and 2-(\alpha/N) <p<(2N-\alpha)/(N-2). \ We assume that both A and V are compatible with the action of some group G of linear isometries of \mathbb{R}^{N}. We establish the existence of multiple complex valued solutions to this equation which satisfy the symmetry condition \[ u(gx)=\tau(g)u(x)\text{\ \ \ for all}g\in G,\text{}x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}, \] where \tau:G\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^{1} is a given group homomorphism into the unit complex numbers.
