This review is dedicated to recent results on the 2d parabolic-elliptic Patlak-Keller-Segel model, and on its variant in higher dimensions where the diffusion is of critical porous medium type. Both of these models have a critical mass M_c such that the solutions exist globally in time if the mass is less than M_c and above which there are solutions which blowup in finite time. The main tools, in particular the free energy, and the idea of the methods are set out. A number of open questions are also stated.
