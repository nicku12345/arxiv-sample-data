This article is concerned with some weighted norm inequalities for the so-called horizontal (i.e. involving time derivatives) area integrals associated to a non-negative self-adjoint operator satisfying a pointwise Gaussian estimate for its heat kernel, as well as the corresponding vertical (i.e. involving space derivatives) area integrals associated to a non-negative self-adjoint operator satisfying in addition a pointwise upper bounds for the gradient of the heat kernel. As applications, we obtain sharp estimates for the operator norm of the area integrals on L^p(\RN) as p becomes large, and the growth of the A_p constant on estimates of the area integrals on the weighted L^p spaces.
