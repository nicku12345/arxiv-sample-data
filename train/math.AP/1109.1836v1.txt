We prove the existence of short time solutions to the incompressible, isotropic Lagrangian Averaged Navier-Stokes equation with low regularity initial data in Besov spaces B^{r}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n), r>n/2p. When p=2 and n\geq 3, we obtain global solutions, provided the parameters r,q and n satisfy certain inequalities. This is an improvement over known analogous Sobolev space results, which required n=3.
