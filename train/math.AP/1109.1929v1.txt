Let \mathrm{X}=(X_{1},...,X_{q}) be a family of real smooth vector fields satisfying H\"{o}mander's condition. The purpose of this paper is to establish gradient estimates in generalized Morrey spaces for weak solutions of the divergence degenerate parabolic system related to X :%\[u_{t}^{i}+X_{\alpha}^{\ast}(a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}(z)X_{\beta}u^{j}%)=g_{i}+X_{\alpha}^{\ast}f_{i}^{\alpha}(z), \] where \alpha,\beta=1,2,...,q, i,j=1,2,...,N, X_{\alpha}^{\ast} is the transposed vector field of X_{\alpha}, z=(t,x)\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n+1}, and coefficients a_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}(z) belong to the space VMO induced by the vector fields X_{1}, ...,X_{q}.
