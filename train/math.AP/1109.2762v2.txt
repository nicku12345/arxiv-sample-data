In this article, we study the large time behavior of solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi Equations, set in a bounded domain with nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions, including the case of dynamical boundary conditions. We establish general convergence results for viscosity solutions of these Cauchy-Neumann problems by using two fairly different methods : the first one relies only on partial differential equations methods, which provides results even when the Hamiltonians are not convex, and the second one is an optimal control/dynamical system approach, named the "weak KAM approach" which requires the convexity of Hamiltonians and gives formulas for asymptotic solutions based on Aubry-Mather sets.
