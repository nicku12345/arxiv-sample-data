We study the boundary value problem with measures for (E1) -\Gd u+g(|\nabla u|)=0 in a bounded domain \Gw in \BBR^N, satisfying (E2)  u=\gm on \prt\Gw and prove that if g\in L^1(1,\infty;t^{-(2N+1)/N}dt) is nondecreasing (E1)-(E2) can be solved with any positive bounded measure. When g(r)\geq r^q with q>1 we prove that any positive function satisfying (E1) admits a boundary trace which is an outer regular Borel measure, not necessarily bounded. When g(r)=r^q with 1
