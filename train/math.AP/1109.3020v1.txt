Oscillations and concentrations in sequences of gradients \{\nabla u_k\}, bounded in L^p(\Omega;\R^{M\times N}) if p>1 and \Omega\subset\R^n is a bounded domain with the extension property in W^{1,p}, and their interaction with local integral functionals can be described by a generalization of Young measures due to DiPerna and Majda. We characterize such DiPerna-Majda measures, thereby extending a result by Ka{\l}amajska and Kru\v{z}\'{\i}k (2008), where the full characterization was possible only for sequences subject to a fixed Dirichlet boundary condition. As an application we state a relaxation result for noncoercive multiple-integral functionals.
