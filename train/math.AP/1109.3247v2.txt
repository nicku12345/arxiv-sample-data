We study the regularity of solutions of parabolic fully nonlinear nonlocal equations. We proof Holder regularity in space and time and for translation invariant equations and under different assumptions on the kernels Holder regularity for the spatial derivatives. The proofs rely on a weak parabolic ABP inspired in recent work done by L. Silvestre and the classic ideas of K. Tso and L. Wang. Our results remain uniform as the order of the equation goes to 2 allowing us to understand the non local theory as an extension to the classical one.
