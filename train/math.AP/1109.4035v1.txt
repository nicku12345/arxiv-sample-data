We consider the multidimensional Euler-Poisson equations with non-zero heat conduction, which consist of a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic-elliptic system of balance laws. We make a deep analysis on the coupling effects and establish a local well-posedness of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem pertaining to data in the critical Besov space. Proof mainly relies on a standard iteration argument. To achieve it, a new Moser-type inequality is developed by the Bony' decomposition.
