Let X be a suitable function space and let \cG \subset X be the set of divergence free vector fields generating a global, smooth solution to the incompressible, homogeneous three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. We prove that a sequence of divergence free vector fields converging in the sense of distributions to an element of \cG belongs to \cG if n is large enough, provided the convergence holds "anisotropically" in frequency space. Typically that excludes self-similar type convergence. Anisotropy appears as an important qualitative feature in the analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations; it is also shown that initial data which does not belong to \cG (hence which produces a solution blowing up in finite time) cannot have a strong anisotropy in its frequency support.
