Aim of this paper is to extend the continuous dependence estimates proved in \cite{JK1} to quasi-monotone systems of fully nonlinear second-order parabolic equations. As by-product of these estimates, we get an H\"older estimate for bounded solutions of systems and a rate of convergence estimate for the vanishing viscosity approximation. In the second part of the paper we employ similar techniques to study the periodic homogenization of quasi-monotone systems of fully nonlinear second-order uniformly parabolic equations. Finally, some examples are discussed.
