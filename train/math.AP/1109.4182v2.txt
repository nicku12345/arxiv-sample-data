Following the ideas proposed in \cite{OMV1} and \cite{OMV2} on active exterior cloaking, we present here a systematic integral equation method to generate suitable quasistatic fields for cloaking, illusions and energy focusing (with given accuracy) in multiple regions of interests. In the quasistatic regime, the central issue is to design appropriate source functions for the Laplace equation so that the resulting solution will satisfy the required properties. We show the existence and non-uniqueness of solutions to the problem and study the physically relevant unique L^2-minimal energy solution. We also provide some numerical evidences on the feasibility of the proposed approach.
