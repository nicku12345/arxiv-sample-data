We study a 2-scale version of the Landau-Lifshitz system of ferromagnetism, introduced by Starynkevitch to modelize hysteresis: the response of the magnetization is fast compared to a slowly varying applied magnetic fi eld. Taking the exchange term into account, in space dimension 3, we prove that, under some natural stability assumption on the equilibria of the system, the strong solutions follow the dynamics of these equilibria. We also give explicit examples of relevant equilibria and exterior magnetic fields, when the ferromagnetic medium occupies some ellipsoidal domain.
