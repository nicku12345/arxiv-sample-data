We consider the stationary semilinear Schr\"odinger equation -\Delta u + a(x) u = f(x,u), u\in H^1(\R^N), where a and f are continuous functions converging to some limits a_\infty>0 and f_\infty=f_\infty(u) as |x|\to\infty. In the indefinite setting where the Schr\"odinger operator -\Delta +a has negative eigenvalues, we combine a reduction method with a topological argument to prove the existence of a solution of our problem under weak one-sided asymptotic estimates. The minimal energy level need not be attained in this case. In a second part of the paper, we prove the existence of ground-state solutions under more restrictive assumptions on a and f. We stress that for some of our results we also allow zero to lie in the spectrum of -\Delta + a.
