This article concerns optimal estimates for non-homogeneous degenerate elliptic equation with source functions in borderline spaces of integrability. We deliver sharp H\"older continuity estimates for solutions to p-degenerate elliptic equations in rough media with sources in the weak Lebesgue space L_\text{weak}^{\frac{n}{p} + \epsilon}. For the borderline case, f \in L_\text{weak}^{\frac{n}{p}}, solutions may not be bounded; nevertheless we show that solutions have bounded mean oscillation, in particular John-Nirenberg's exponential integrability estimates can be employed. All the results presented in this paper are optimal. Our approach is based on powerful Caffarelli-type compactness methods and it can be employed in a number order situations.
