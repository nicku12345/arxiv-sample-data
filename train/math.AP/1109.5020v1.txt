This paper is devoted to the study of L_{p} Lyapunov-type inequalities ( \ 1 \leq p \leq +\infty) for linear partial differential equations at radial higher eigenvalues. More precisely, we treat the case of Neumann boundary conditions on balls in \real^{N}. It is proved that the relation between the quantities p and N/2 plays a crucial role to obtain nontrivial and optimal Lyapunov inequalities. By using appropriate minimizing sequences and a detailed analysis about the number and distribution of zeros of radial nontrivial solutions, we show significant qualitative differences according to the studied case is subcritical, supercritical or critical.
