Recently, A. Gruenrock and H. Pecher proved global well-posedness of the 2d Dirac-Klein-Gordon equations given initial data for the spinor and scalar fields in H^s and H^{s+1/2} \times H^{s-1/2}, respectively, where s\ge 0, but uniqueness was only known in a contraction space of Bourgain type, strictly smaller than the natural solution space C([0,T]; H^s \times H^{s+1/2} \times H^{s-1/2}). Here we prove uniqueness in the latter space for s \ge 0. This improves a recent result of H. Pecher, where the range s>1/30 was covered.
