We consider a class of pseudodifferential operators with a doubly characteristic point, where the quadratic part of the symbol fails to be elliptic but obeys an averaging assumption. Under suitable additional assumptions, semiclassical resolvent estimates are established, where the modulus of the spectral parameter is allowed to grow slightly more rapidly than the semiclassical parameter.
