In this note, we study Liouville theorems for the stable and finite Morse index weak solutions of the quasilinear elliptic equation -\Delta_p u= f(x) F(u)  in \mathbb{R}^n where p\ge 2, 0\le f\in C(\mathbb{R}^n) and F\in C^1(\mathbb{R}). We refer to f(x) as {\it weight} and to F(u) as {\it nonlinearity}. The remarkable fact is that if the weight function is bounded from below by a strict positive constant that is 0<C\le f then it does not have much impact on the stable solutions, however, a nonnegative weight that is 0\le f will push certain critical dimensions. This analytical observation has potential to be applied in various models to push certain well-known critical dimensions.   For a general nonlinearity F\in C^1(\mathbb{R}) and f(x)=|x|^\alpha, we prove Liouville theorems in dimensions n\le \frac{4(p+\alpha)}{p-1}+p, for bounded radial stable solutions. For specific nonlinearities F(u)=e^u, u^q where q>p-1 and -u^{q} where q<0, known as the Gelfand, the Lane-Emden and the negative exponent nonlinearities, respectively, we prove Liouville theorems for both radial finite Morse index (not necessarily bounded) and stable (not necessarily radial nor bounded) solutions.
