We examine equations of the form {eqnarray*} \{{array}{lcl} \hfill \HA u &=& \lambda g(x) f(u) \qquad \text{in}\ \Omega \hfill u&=& 0 \qquad \qquad \qquad \text{on}\ \pOm, {array}.   {eqnarray*} where  \lambda >0 is a parameter and  \Omega is a smooth bounded domain in  \IR^N,  N \ge 2. Here  g is a positive function and  f is an increasing, convex function with  f(0)=1 and either  f blows up at 1 or  f is superlinear at infinity. We show that the extremal solution u^* associated with the extremal parameter  \lambda^* is the unique solution. We also show that when f is suitably supercritical and  \Omega satisfies certain geometrical conditions then there is a unique solution for small positive  \lambda.
