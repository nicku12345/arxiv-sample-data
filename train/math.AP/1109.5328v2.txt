First of all, we get the global existence of classical and strong solutions of the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions with initial data which is large and spherically or cylindrically symmetric. The appearance of vacuum is allowed. In particular, if the initial data is spherically symmetric, the space dimension can be taken not less than two. The analysis is based on some delicate {\it a priori} estimates globally in time which depend on the assumption \kappa=O(1+\theta^q) where q>r (r can be zero), which relaxes the condition q\ge2+2r in [14,29,42]. This could be viewed as an extensive work of [18] where the equations hold in the sense of distributions in the set where the density is positive with initial data which is large, discontinuous, and spherically or cylindrically symmetric in three space dimension. Finally, with the assumptions that vacuum may appear and that the solutions are not necessarily symmetric, we establish a blow-up criterion in terms of \|\rho\|_{L^\infty_tL_x^\infty} and \|\rho\theta\|_{L^4_tL^(12/5)_x} for strong solutions.
