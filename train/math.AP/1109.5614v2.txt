We study the following boundary value problem (P)\ \ \ \ \ {-\mathrm{div}(a(|\nabla u|)\nabla u)=f(x,u),\ & in \Omega, u=0, & on \partial\Omega} with nonhomogeneous principal part. By assuming the nonlinearity f(x, t) being subcritical growth, some abstract results of problem (P) are obtained: (1) Regularity; (2) Orlicz-Sobolev versus H\"{o}lder local minimizer; (3) Strong comparison principle. Applying these abstract results and critical point theory, we prove the existence of multiple solutions of problem (P) in an Orlicz-Sobolev space.
