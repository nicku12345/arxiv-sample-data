Existence of local-in-time unique solution and loss of smoothness of full Magnet-Hydro-Dynamics system (MHD) is considered for periodic initial data. The result is proven using Fujita-Kato's method in \ell^1 based (for the Fourier coefficients) functional spaces enabling us to easily estimate nonlinear terms in the system as well as solutions to Maxwells's equations. A loss of smoothness result is shown for the velocity and magnetic field. It comes from the damped-wave operator which does not have any smoothing effect.
