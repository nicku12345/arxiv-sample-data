In this paper, we study the deformation of the 2 dimensional convex surfaces in \R^{3} whose speed at a point on the surface is proportional to \alpha-power of positive part of Gauss Curvature. First, for 1/2<\alpha\leq 1, we show that there is smooth solution if the initial data is smooth and strictly convex and that there is a viscosity solution with C^{1,1}-estimate before the collapsing time if the initial surface is only convex. Moreover, we show that there is a waiting time effect which means the flat spot of the convex surface will persist for a while. We also show the interface between the flat side and the strictly convex side of the surface remains smooth on 0 < t < T_0 under certain necessary regularity and non-degeneracy initial conditions, where  T_0 is the vanishing time of the flat side.
