The paper focuses on a model describing the spreading of an insoluble surfactant on a thin viscous film with capillary effects taken into account. The governing equation for the film height is degenerate parabolic of fourth order and coupled to a second order parabolic equation for the surfactant concentration. It is shown that nonnegative weak solutions exist under natural assumptions on the surface tension coefficient.
