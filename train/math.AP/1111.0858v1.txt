In this paper, we prove that the Cauchy problem associated to the following higher-order Benjamin-Ono equation  \partial_tv-b\mathcal{H}\partial^2_xv- a\epsilon \partial_x^3v=cv\partial_xv-d\epsilon \partial_x(v\mathcal{H}\partial_xv+\mathcal{H}(v\partial_xv)),  is globally well-posed in the energy space H^1(\mathbb R). Moreover, we study the limit behavior when the small positive parameter \epsilon tends to zero and show that, under a condition on the coefficients a, b, c and d, the solution v_{\epsilon} to this equation converges to the corresponding solution of the Benjamin-Ono equation.
