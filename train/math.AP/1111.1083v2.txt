We prove a Liouville type theorem for arbitrarily growing positive viscosity supersolutions of fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations in halfspaces. Precisely, let M^-_{\lambda, \Lambda} be the Pucci's inf- operator, defined as the infimum of all linear uniformly elliptic operators with ellipticity constants \Lambda \geq \lambda >0. Then, we prove that the inequality M^-_{\lambda, \Lambda}(D^2u) +u^p \leq 0 does not have any positive viscosity solution in a halfspace provided that -1\leq p \leq (\Lambda/\lambda n+1)/(\Lambda/\lambda n-1), whereas positive solutions do exist if either p < -1 or p > (\Lambda/\lambda (n-1)+2)/(\Lambda/\lambda (n-1)). This will be accomplished by constructing explicit subsolutions of the homogeneous equation M^-_{\lambda, \Lambda}(D^2u)=0 and by proving a nonlinear version in a halfspace of the classical Hadamard three-circles Theorem for entire superharmonic functions.
