We consider, in a smooth bounded multiply connected domain \dom\subset\R^2, the Ginzburg-Landau energy \d E_\v(u)=1/2\int_\dom{|\n u|^2}+\frac{1}{4\v^2}\int_\dom{(1-|u|^2)^2} subject to prescribed degree conditions on each component of \p\dom. In general, minimal energy maps do not exist \cite{BeMi1}. When \dom has a single hole, Berlyand and Rybalko \cite{BeRy1} proved that for small \v local minimizers do exist. We extend the result in \cite{BeRy1}: \d E_\v(u) has, in domains \dom with 2,3,... holes and for small \v, local minimizers. Our approach is very similar to the one in \cite{BeRy1}; the main difference stems in the construction of test functions with energy control.
