This paper investigates the global (in time) regularity of solutions to a system of equations that generalize the vorticity formulation of the 2D Boussinesq-Navier-Stokes equations. The velocity u in this system is related to the vorticity \omega through the relations u=\nabla^\perp \psi and \Delta \psi = \Lambda^\sigma (\log(I-\Delta))^\gamma \omega, which reduces to the standard velocity-vorticity relation when \sigma=\gamma=0. When either \sigma>0 or \gamma>0, the velocity u is more singular. The "quasi-velocity" v determined by \nabla\times v =\omega satisfies an equation of very special structure. This paper establishes the global regularity and uniqueness of solutions for the case when \sigma=0 and \gamma\ge 0. In addition, the vorticity \omega is shown to be globally bounded in several functional settings such as L^2 for \sigma>0 in a suitable range.
