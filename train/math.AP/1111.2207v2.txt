We analyze the semilinear elliptic equation \Delta u=\rho(x) f(u), u>0 in {\mathbf R}^D (D\ge3), with a particular emphasis put on the qualitative study of entire large solutions, that is, solutions u such that \lim_{|x|\rightarrow +\infty}u(x)=+\infty. Assuming that f satisfies the Keller-Osserman growth assumption and that \rho decays at infinity in a suitable sense, we prove the existence of entire large solutions. We then discuss the more delicate questions of asymptotic behavior at infinity, uniqueness and symmetry of solutions.
