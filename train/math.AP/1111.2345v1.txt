The paper deals with the defocusing case of the energy subcritical non-linear wave equation in R^3. We assume the initial data is in the space \dot{H}^s \times \dot{H}^{s-1} and radial. If s=1, this is the energy space and the scattering results are known. In this paper we choose 15/16<s<1 and assume that the nonlinearity equals -|u|^p u with p = 2/{3/2 -s}, so that this problem is \dot{H}^s \times \dot{H}^{s-1} critical. We will prove the global well-posedness and scattering of the solution under the additional assumption that the \dot{H}^s \times \dot{H}^{s-1} norm of the solution is uniformly bounded for all time t in the maximal lifespan of the solution.
