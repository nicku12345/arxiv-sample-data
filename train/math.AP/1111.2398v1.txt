In this paper, we consider periodic soft inclusions T_{\epsilon} with periodicity \epsilon, where the solution, u_{\epsilon}, satisfies semi-linear elliptic equations of non-divergence in \Omega_{\epsilon}=\Omega\setminus \bar{T}_\epsilon with a Neumann data on \partial T^{\mathfrak a} . The difficulty lies in the non-divergence structure of the operator where the standard energy method based on the divergence theorem can not be applied. The main object is developing a viscosity method to find the homogenized equation satisfied by the limit of u_{\epsilon}, called as u, as \epsilon approaches to zero. We introduce the concept of a compatibility condition between the equation and the Neumann condition on the boundary for the existence of uniformly bounded periodic first correctors. The concept of second corrector has been developed to show the limit, u, is the viscosity solution of a homogenized equation.
