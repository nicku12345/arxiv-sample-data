Thanks to averaging processes and Gamma-convergence techniques, we are able to link a microscopic description of ferromagnetic materials based on spin lattices and their mesoscopic description in the static framework for the three fundamental contributions: exchange, magnetostatic and external field. The results are in accordance with the classical continuous description of ferromagnetic phenomena and justifies it. This work is a seed towards a dynamic description of ferromagnetic materials.
