Regularity and uniqueness of weak solutions of the compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity coefficients is proven for small time in dimension N=2,3 under periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, the initial density is not required to have a positive lower bound and the pressure law is assumed to satisfy a condition that reduces to P(\rho)=a\rho^{\gamma} with \gamma>1 (in dimension three, additional conditions of size will be ask on \gamma). The second part of the paper is devoted to blow-up criteria for slightly subcritical initial data for the scaling of the equations when the viscosity coefficients (\mu,\lambda) are assumed constant provided that their ratio is large enough (in particular 0<\lambda<(5/4)\mu). More precisely we prove that under the condition \rho belongs to L^{\infty}((0,T)\times\T^{N}) then we can extend the unique solution beyond T>0. Finally, we prove that weak solutions in the torus \mathbb{T}^{N} turn out to be smooth as long as the density remains bounded in L^{\infty}(0,T,L^{(N+1+\e)\gamma}(\mathbb{T}^{N})) with \e>0 arbitrary small. This result may be considered as a Prodi-Serrin theorem (see \cite{prodi} and \cite{serrin}) for compressible Navier-Stokes system.
