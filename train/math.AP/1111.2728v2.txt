This paper provides universal, optimal moduli of continuity for viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations F(X, D^2u) = f(X), based on weakest integrability properties of f in different scenarios. The primary result established in this work is a sharp Log-Lipschitz estimate on u based on the L^n norm of f, which corresponds to optimal regularity bounds for the critical threshold case. Optimal C^{1,\alpha} regularity estimates are delivered when f\in L^{n+\epsilon}. The limiting upper borderline case, f\in L^\infty, also has transcendental importance to elliptic regularity theory and its applications. In this paper we show, under convexity assumption on F, that u \in C^{1,\mathrm{Log-Lip}}, provided f has bounded mean oscillation. Once more, such an estimate is optimal. For the lower borderline integrability condition allowed by the theory, we establish interior \textit{a priori} estimates on the C^{0,\frac{n-2\epsilon}{n-\epsilon}} norm of u based on the L^{n-\epsilon} norm of f, where \epsilon is the Escauriaza universal constant. The exponent \frac{n-2\epsilon}{n-\epsilon} is optimal. When the source function f lies in L^q, n > q > n-\epsilon, we also obtain the exact, improved sharp H\"older exponent of continuity.
