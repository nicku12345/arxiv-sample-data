The purpose of this paper is twofold. We first prove a weighted Sobolev inequality and part of a weighted Morrey's inequality, where the weights are a power of the mean curvature of the level sets of the function appearing in the inequalities. Then, as main application of our inequalities, we establish new L^q and W^{1,q} estimates for semi-stable solutions of -\Delta u=g(u) in a bounded domain \Omega of \mathbb{R}^n. These estimates lead to an L^{2n/(n-4)}(\Omega) bound for the extremal solution of -\Delta u=\lambda f(u) when n\geq 5 and the domain is convex. We recall that extremal solutions are known to be bounded in convex domains if n\leq 4, and that their boundedness is expected ---but still unkwown--- for n\leq 9.
