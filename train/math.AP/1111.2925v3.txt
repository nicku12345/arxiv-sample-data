The low Mach number limit for the full compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with general initial data is rigorously justified in the whole space \mathbb{R}^3. The uniform in Mach number estimates of the solutions in a Sobolev space are obtained on a time interval independent of the Mach number. The limit is proved by using the established uniform estimates and a theorem due to M\'etiver and Schochet [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 158 (2001), 61-90] for the Euler equations that gives the local energy decay of the acoustic wave equations.
