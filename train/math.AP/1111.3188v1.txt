We prove existence of a global conservative solution of the Cauchy problem for the two-component Camassa-Holm (2CH) system on the line, allowing for nonvanishing and distinct asymptotics at plus and minus infinity. The solution is proven to be smooth as long as the density is bounded away from zero. Furthermore, we show that by taking the limit of vanishing density in the 2CH system, we obtain the global conservative solution of the (scalar) Camassa-Holm equation, which provides a novel way to define and obtain these solutions. Finally, it is shown that while solutions of the 2CH system have infinite speed of propagation, singularities travel with finite speed.
