This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the Fisher-KPP equation in a heterogeneous medium, \partial_t u = \partial_{xx} u + f(x,u), associated with a compactly supported initial datum. A typical nonlinearity we consider is f(x,u) = \mu_0 (\phi (x)) u(1-u), where \mu_0 is a 1-periodic function and \phi is a \mathcal{C}^1 increasing function that satisfies \lim_{x\to +\infty} \phi (x) = +\infty and \lim_{x\to +\infty} \phi' (x) = 0. Although quite specific, the choice of such a reaction term is motivated by its highly heterogeneous nature. We exhibit two different behaviors for u for large times, depending on the speed of the convergence of \phi at infinity. If \phi grows sufficiently slowly, then we prove that the spreading speed of u oscillates between two distinct values. If \phi grows rapidly, then we compute explicitly a unique and well determined speed of propagation w_\infty, arising from the limiting problem of an infinite period. We give a heuristic interpretation for these two behaviors.
