Here we define Rarita-Schwinger operators on cylinders and construct their fundamental solutions. Further the fundamental solutions to the cylindrical Rarita-Schwinger type operators are achieved by applying translation groups. In turn, a Borel-Pompeiu Formula, Cauchy Integral Formula and a Cauchy Transform are presented for the cylinders. Moreover we show a construction of a number of conformally inequivalent spinor bundles on these cylinders. Again we construct Rarita-Schwinger operators and their fundamental solutions in this setting. Finally we study the remaining Rarita-Schwinger type operators on cylinders.
