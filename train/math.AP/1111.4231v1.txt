We consider semilinear wave equations with small initial data in two space dimensions. For a class of wave equations with cubic nonlinearity, we show the global existence of small amplitude solutions, and give an asymptotic description of the solution as t \to \infty uniformly in x \in {\mathbb R}^2. In particular, our result implies the decay of the energy when the nonlinearity is dissipative.
