We study the global boundedness of bilinear and multilinear Fourier integral operators on Banach and quasi-Banach L^p spaces, where the amplitudes of the operators are smooth or rough in the spatial variables. The results are obtained by proving suitable global boundedness of rough linear Fourier integral operators with amplitudes that behave as L^{p} functions in the spatial variables. The bilinear and multilinear boundedness estimates are proven by using either an iteration procedure or decomposition of the amplitudes, and thereafter applying our global results for linear Fourier integral operators with rough amplitudes.
