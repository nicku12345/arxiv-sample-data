We prove the global L^2 \times L^2 \to L^1 boundedness of bilinear Fourier integral operators with amplitudes in S^0_{1,0} (n,2). To achieve this, we require that the phase function can be written as (x,\xi,\eta) \mapsto \phase_1(x,\xi) + \phase_2(x,\eta) where each \phase_j belongs to the class \Phi^2 and satisfies the strong non-degeneracy condition. This result extends that of R. Coifman and Y. Meyer regarding pseudodifferential operators to the case of Fourier integral operators.
