In this paper we study the existence and the instability of standing waves with prescribed L^2-norm for a class of Schr\"odinger-Poisson-Slater equations in \R^{3} %orbitally stable standing waves with arbitray charge for the following Schr\"odinger-Poisson type equation \label{evolution1} i\psi_{t}+ \Delta \psi - (|x|^{-1}*|\psi|^{2}) \psi+|\psi|^{p-2}\psi=0 % \text{in} \R^{3}, when p \in (10/3,6). To obtain such solutions we look to critical points of the energy functional F(u)=1/2| \triangledown u|_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^3)}^2+1/4\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\frac{|u(x)|^2| u(y)|^2}{|x-y|}dxdy-\frac{1}{p}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}|u|^pdx  on the constraints given by S(c)= \{u \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) :|u|_{L^2(\R^3)}^2=c, c>0}. For the values p \in (10/3, 6) considered, the functional F is unbounded from below on S(c) and the existence of critical points is obtained by a mountain pass argument developed on S(c). We show that critical points exist provided that c>0 is sufficiently small and that when c>0 is not small a non-existence result is expected. Concerning the dynamics we show for initial condition u_0\in H^1(\R^3) of the associated Cauchy problem with |u_0|_{2}^2=c that the mountain pass energy level \gamma(c) gives a threshold for global existence. Also the strong instability of standing waves at the mountain pass energy level is proved. Finally we draw a comparison between the Schr\"odinger-Poisson-Slater equation and the classical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.
