In this paper we study the Cauchy problem for one multidimensional compressible nonlocal model of the dissipative quasi-geostrophic equations. First, we obtain the local existence and uniqueness of the smooth non-negative solution or the strong solution in time. Secondly, for the sub-critical and critical case 1\le\alpha\leq 2, we obtain the global existence and uniqueness results of the nonnegative smooth solution. Then, we prove the global existence of the weak solution for 0\le \alpha\le 2 and \nu\ge 0. Finally, for the sub-critical case, we establish the global H^1 and L^p, p>2, decay rate of the smooth solution as t\to\infty.
