Lie symmetry group method is applied to study for the higher order Camassa-Holm equation. The symmetry group and its optimal system are given. Furthermore, preliminary classification of its group invariant solutions, symmetry reduction and nonclassical symmetries are investigated. Finally conservation laws for the higher order Camassa-Holm equation are presented.
