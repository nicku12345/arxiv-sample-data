In this paper, Lie symmetry method is performed for the Hirota-Ramani (H-R) equation. We will find The symmetry group and optimal systems of Lie subalgebras. Furthermore, preliminary classification of its group invariant solutions, symmetry reduction and nonclassical symmeries are investigated. Finally the conservation laws of the H-R equation are presented.
