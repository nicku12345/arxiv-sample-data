We prove via explicitly constructed initial data that solutions to the gravity-capillary wave system in \mathbb{R}^3 representing a 2d air-water interface immediately fails to be C^3 with respect to the initial data if the initial data (h_0, \psi_0) \in H^{s+\frac12} \otimes H^{s} for s<3. Similar results hold in \mathbb{R}^2 domains with a 1d interface. Furthermore, we discuss the illposedness threshold for the pure gravity water wave system.
