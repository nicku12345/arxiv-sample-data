We represent three generations of students: Bob Glassey, Walter's student finishing at Brown in 1972, Jack Schaeffer, Bob's student finishing at Indiana University in 1983, and Steve Pankavich, Jack's student finishing at Carnegie Mellon in 2005. We have all thrived professionally from our association with Walter and are delighted to dedicate this note to him on the occasion of his 70th birthday. The problem we study concerns the asymptotic behavior of solutions to Vlasov equations, an area to which Walter has contributed greatly.
