We investigate the L^2-supercritical and \dot{H}^1-subcritical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in H^1. In \cite{G1} and \cite{yuan}, the mass-energy quantity M(Q)^{\frac{1-s_{c}}{s_{c}}}E(Q) has been shown to be a threshold for the dynamical behavior of solutions of the equation. In the present paper, we study the dynamics at the critical level M(u)^{\frac{1-s_{c}}{s_{c}}}E(u)=M(Q)^{\frac{1-s_{c}}{s_{c}}}E(Q) and classify the corresponding solutions using modulation theory, non-trivially generalize the results obtained in \cite{holmer3} for the 3D cubic Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
