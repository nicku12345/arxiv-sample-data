We prove that if t \mapsto u(t) \in \mathrm {BV}(\R) is the entropy solution to a N \times N strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws with genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields \[ u_t + f(u)_x = 0, \] then up to a countable set of times \{t_n\}_{n \in \mathbb N} the function u(t) is in \mathrm {SBV}, i.e. its distributional derivative u_x is a measure with no Cantorian part.   The proof is based on the decomposition of u_x(t) into waves belonging to the characteristic families \[ u(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N v_i(t) \tilde r_i(t), \quad v_i(t) \in \mathcal M(\R), \ \tilde r_i(t) \in \mathrm R^N, \] and the balance of the continuous/jump part of the measures v_i in regions bounded by characteristics. To this aim, a new interaction measure \mu_{i,\jump} is introduced, controlling the creation of atoms in the measure v_i(t).   The main argument of the proof is that for all t where the Cantorian part of v_i is not 0, either the Glimm functional has a downward jump, or there is a cancellation of waves or the measure \mu_{i,\mathrm{jump}} is positive.
