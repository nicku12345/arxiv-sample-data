This article shows that knowledge of the Dirichlet-Neumann map on certain subsets of the boundary for input functions supported roughly on the rest of the boundary can be used to determine a magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator. With some geometric conditions on the domain, either the subset on which the DN map is measured or the subset on which the input functions have support may be made arbitrarily small. This is an improvement on the partial data result in a paper by Dos Santos Ferreira, Kenig, Sj\"{o}strand, and Uhlmann. The method involves modifying the Carleman estimate in that paper by conjugation with operators built from pseudodifferential pieces.
