We study in this paper the periodic homogenization problem related to a strongly nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation. Owing to the large reaction term, the homogenized equation has a rather quite different form which puts together both the reaction and convection effects. We show in a special case that, the homogenized equation is exactly of a convection-diffusion type. The study relies on a suitable version of the well-known two-scale convergence method.
