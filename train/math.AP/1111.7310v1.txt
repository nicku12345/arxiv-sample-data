In this article, we give probabilistic versions of Sobolev embeddings on any Riemannian manifold (M,g). More precisely, we prove that for natural probability measures on L^2(M), almost every function belong to all spaces L^p(M), p<+\infty. We then give applications to the study of the growth of the L^p norms of spherical harmonics on spheres \mathbb{S}^d: we prove (again for natural probability measures) that almost every Hilbert base of L^2(\mathbb{S}^d) made of spherical harmonics has all its elements uniformly bounded in all L^p(\mathbb{S}^d), p<+\infty spaces. We also prove similar results on tori \mathbb{T}^d. We give then an application to the study of the decay rate of damped wave equations in a frame-work where the geometric control property on Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch is not satisfied. Assuming that it is violated for a measure 0 set of trajectories, we prove that there exists almost surely a rate. Finally, we conclude with an application to the study of the H^1-supercritical wave equation, for which we prove that for almost all initial data, the weak solutions are strong and unique, locally in time.
