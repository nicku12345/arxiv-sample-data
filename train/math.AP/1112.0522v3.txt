We give a direct proof of well-posedness of solutions to general selection-mutation and structured population models with measures as initial data. This is motivated by the fact that some stationary states of these models are measures and not L^1 functions, so the measures are a more natural space to study their dynamics. Our techniques are based on distances between measures appearing in optimal transport and common arguments involving Picard iterations. These tools provide a simplification of previous approaches and are applicable or adaptable to a wide variety of models in population dynamics.
