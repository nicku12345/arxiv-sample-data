By working with the periodic resolvent kernel and Bloch-decomposition, we establish pointwise bounds for the Green function of the linearized equation associated with spatially periodic traveling waves of a system of reaction diffusion equations.With our linearized estimates together with a nonlinear iteration scheme developed by Johnson-Zumbrun, we obtain L^p- behavior(p \geq 1) of a nonlinear solution to a perturbation equation of a reaction-diffusion equation with respect to initial data in L^1 \cap H^1 recovering and slightly sharpening results obtained by Schneider using weighted energy and renormalization techniques. We obtain also pointwise nonlinear estimates with respect to two different initial perturbations |u_0|\leq E_0e^{-|x|^2/M} and |u_0| \leq E_0(1+|x|)^{-3/2}, respectively, E_0>0 sufficiently small and M>1 sufficiently large, showing that behavior is that of a heat kernel. These pointwise bounds have not been obtained elsewhere, and do not appear to be accessible by previous techniques.
