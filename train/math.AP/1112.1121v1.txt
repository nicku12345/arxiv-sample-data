We study the energy-critical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an energy- subcritical perturbation. We show the existence of a ground state in the four or higher dimensions. Moreover, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for a solution to scatter, in the spirit of Kenig-Merle [16].
