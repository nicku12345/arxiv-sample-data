In this paper, by explicitly calculating the principal symbols of pseudodifferential operators and by applying H\"omander's spectral function theorem, we obtain the Weyl-type asymptotic formulas with sharp remainder estimates for the counting functions of the two classes of biharmonic Steklov eigenvalues \lambda_k and \mu_k in a smooth bounded domain of a Riemannian manifold. This solves a longstanding challenging problem.
