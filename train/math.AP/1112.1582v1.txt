In this paper, an exact smooth solution for the equations modeling the bedload transport of sediment in Shallow Water is presented. This solution is valid for a large family of sedimentation laws which are widely used in erosion modeling such as the Grass model or those of Meyer-Peter & Muller. One of the main interest of this solution is the derivation of numerical benchmarks to valid the approximation methods.
