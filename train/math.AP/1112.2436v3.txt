We study Neumann functions for divergence form, second order elliptic systems with bounded measurable coefficients in a bounded Lipschitz domain or a Lipschitz graph domain. We establish existence, uniqueness, and various estimates for the Neumann functions under the assumption that weak solutions of the system enjoy interior H\"older continuity. Also, we establish global pointwise bounds for the Neumann functions under the assumption that weak solutions of the system satisfy a certain natural local boundedness estimate. Moreover, we prove that such a local boundedness estimate for weak solutions of the system is in fact equivalent to the global pointwise bound for the Neumann function. We present a unified approach valid for both the scalar and the vectorial cases.
