We obtain sharp L^p and H\"older estimates for the Neumann function of the operator \nabla \cdot \gamma \nabla - ik on a bounded domain. We also obtain quantitative description of its singularity. We then apply these estimates to quantitative photo-acoustic imaging in inhomogeneous media. The problem is to reconstruct the optical absorption coefficient of a diametrically small anomaly from the absorbed energy density.
