We prove real analyticity of all the streamlines, including the free surface, of a gravity- or capillary-gravity-driven steady flow of water over a flat bed, with a H\"{o}lder continuous vorticity function, provided that the propagating speed of the wave on the free surface exceeds the horizontal fluid velocity throughout the flow. Furthermore, if the vorticity possesses some Gevrey regularity of index s, then the stream function admits the same Gevrey regularity throughout the fluid domain; in particular if the Gevrey index s equals to 1, then we obtain analyticity of the stream function. The regularity results hold for both periodic and solitary water waves.
