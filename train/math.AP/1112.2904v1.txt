In this paper, we consider a new coupled PDE model for image restoration. Both the image and the edge variables are incorporated by coupling them into two different PDEs. It is shown that the initial-boundary value problem has global in time dissipative solutions (in a sense going back to P.-L. Lions), and several properties of these solutions are established. This is a rough draft, and the final version of the paper will contain a modelling part and numerical experiments.
