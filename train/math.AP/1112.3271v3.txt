In this paper we initiate the mathematical analysis of a system of nonlinear Stochastic Partial Differential equations describing the motion of turbulent Non-Newtonian media in the presence of fluctuating magnetic field. The system is basically obtained by a coupling of the dynamical equations of a Non-Newtonian fluids having p-structure and the Maxwell equations. We mainly show the existence of weak martingale solutions and their exponential decay when time goes to infinity.
