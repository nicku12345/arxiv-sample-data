We study the Neumann initial-boundary value problem for the fully parabolic Keller-Segel system u_t=\Delta u - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v), \qquad x\in\Omega, \ t>0, [1mm] v_t=\Delta v-v+u, \qquad x\in\Omega, \ t>0, where \Omega is a ball in {\mathbb{R}}^n with n\ge 3.   It is proved that for any prescribed m>0 there exist radially symmetric positive initial data (u_0,v_0) \in C^0(\bar\Omega) \times W^{1,\infty}(\Omega) with \int_\Omega u_0=m such that the corresponding solution blows up in finite time.   Moreover, by providing an essentially explicit blow-up criterion it is shown that within the space of all radial functions, the set of such blow-up enforcing initial data indeed is large in an appropriate sense; in particular, this set is dense with respect to the topology of L^p(\Omega) \times W^{1,2}(\Omega) for any p \in (1,\frac{2n}{n+2}).
