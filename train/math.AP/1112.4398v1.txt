In this paper, we prove a sharp lower bound of the first (nonzero) eigenvalue of Finsler-Laplacian with the Neumann boundary condition. Equivalently, we prove an optimal anisotropic Poincar\'e inequality for convex domains, which generalizes the result of Payne-Weinberger. A lower bound of the first (nonzero) eigenvalue of Finsler-Laplacian with the Dirichlet boundary condition is also proved.
