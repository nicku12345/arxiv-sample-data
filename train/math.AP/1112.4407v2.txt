A relaxed notion of displacement convexity is defined and used to establish short time existence and uniqueness of Wasserstein gradient flows for higher order energy functionals. As an application, local and global well-posedness of different higher order non-linear evolution equations are derived. Examples include the thin-film equation and the quantum drift diffusion equation in one spatial variable.
