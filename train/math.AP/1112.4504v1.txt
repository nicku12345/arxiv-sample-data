In this paper we provide sharp criteria for linear stability or instability of equilibria of collisionless plasmas in the presence of boundaries. Specifically, we consider the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system with specular reflection at the boundary for the particles and with the perfectly conducting boundary condition for the electromagnetic field. Here we initiate our investigation in the simple geometry of radial and longitudinal symmetry.
