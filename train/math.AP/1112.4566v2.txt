We consider a system coupling the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel equations to the in- compressible Navier-Stokes equations in spatial dimensions two and three. We establish the local existence of regular solutions and present some blow-up criteria. For two dimensional Navier-Stokes-Keller-Segel equations, regular solutions constructed locally in time are, in reality, extended globally under some assumptions pertinent to experimental observation in [20] on the consumption rate and chemotactic sensitivity. We also show the existence of global weak solutions in spatially three dimensions with rather restrictive consumption rate and chemotactic sensitivity.
