In this paper, we continue the study in \cite{MiaoWZ:NLS:3d Combined} to show the scattering and blow-up result of the solution for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the energy below the threshold m in the energy space H^1(\R^d), iu_t + \Delta u = -|u|^{4/(d-2)}u + |u|^{4/(d-1)}u, \; d\geq 5. \tag{CNLS} The threshold is given by the ground state W for the energy-critical NLS: iu_t + \Delta u = -|u|^{4/(d-2)}u. Compared with the argument in \cite{MiaoWZ:NLS:3d Combined}, the new ingredient is that we use the double duhamel formula in \cite{Kiv:Clay Lecture, TaoVZ:NLS:mass compact} to lower the regularity of the critical element in L^{\infty}_tH^1_x to L^{\infty}\dot H^{-\epsilon}_x for some \epsilon>0 in five and higher dimensions and obtain the compactness of the critical element in L^2_x, which is used to control the spatial center function x(t) of the critical element and furthermore used to defeat the critical element in the reductive argument.
