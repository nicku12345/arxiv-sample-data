In this work we study a dispersive equation with a dissipative term, the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers equation. First we prove that the initial value problem for this equation is well-posed in H^s(\mathbb{R}), for s\geq 0 and ill-posed if s< 0. The ill-posedness is in the sense that the flow-map cannot be continuous at the origin from H^s(\mathbb{R}) to even \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}). Additionally, we establish an exact theory of convergence of the periodic solutions to the continuous one, in Sobolev spaces, as the period goes to infinity.
