This paper is devoted to the family \{G_n\} of hypergeometric series of any finite number of variables, the coefficients being the square of the multinomial coefficients (\ell_1+...+\ell_n)!/(\ell_1!...\ell_n!), where n\in\ZZ_{\ge 1}. All these series belong to the family of the general Appell-Lauricella's series. It is shown that each function G_n can be expressed by an integral involving the previous one, G_{n-1}. Thus this family can be represented by a multidimensional Euler type integral, what suggests some explicit link with the Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky's theory of A-hypergeometric systems or with the Aomoto's theory of hypermeotric functions. The quasi-invariance of each function G_n with regard to the action of a finite number of involutions of \CC^{*n} is also established. Finally, a particular attention is reserved to the study of the functions G_2 and G_3, each of which is proved to be algebraic or to be expressed by the Legendre's elliptic function of the first kind.
