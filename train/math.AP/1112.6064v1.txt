In this paper, we consider non-local integro-differential equations under certain natural assumptions on the kernel, and obtain persistence of H\"{o}lder continuity for their solutions. In other words, we prove that a solution stays in C^\beta for all time if its initial data lies in C^\beta. This result has an application for a fully non-linear problem, which is used in the field of image processing. The proof is in the spirit of the paper [18] of Kiselev and Nazarov where they established H\"{o}lder continuity of the critical surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation.
