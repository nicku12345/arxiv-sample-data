In this paper we consider quasilinear Keller-Segel type systems of two kinds in higher dimensions. In the case of a nonlinear diffusion system we prove an optimal (with respect to possible nonlinear diffusions generating explosion in finite time of solutions) finite-time blowup result. In the case of a cross-diffusion system we give results which are optimal provided one assumes some proper non-decay of a nonlinear chemical sensitivity. Moreover, we show that once we do not assume the above mentioned non-decay, our result cannot be as strong as in the case of nonlinear diffusion without nonlinear cross-diffusion terms. To this end we provide an example, interesting by itself, of global-in-time unbounded solutions to the nonlinear cross-diffusion Keller-Segel system with chemical sensitivity decaying fast enough, in a range of parameters in which there is a finite-time blowup result in a corresponding case without nonlinear cross-diffusion.
