The main purpose of our paper is to prove sharp Adams-type inequalities in unbounded domains of \mathbb{R}^{n} for the Sobolev space W^{m,\frac{n}{m}}\left(\mathbb{R} ^{n}\right) for any positive integer m less than n. Our results complement those of Ruf and Sani \cite{RS} where such inequalities are only established for even integer m. Our inequalities are also a generalization of the Adams-type inequalities in the special case n=2m=4 proved in \cite{Y} and stronger than those in \cite{RS} when n=2m for all positive integer m by using different Sobolev norms.
