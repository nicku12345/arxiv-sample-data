In this paper, we prove a version of weighted inequalities of exponential type for fractional integrals with sharp constants in any domain of finite measure in \mathbb{R}^{n}. Using this we prove a sharp singular Adams inequality in high order Sobolev spaces in bounded domain at critical case. Then we prove sharp singular Adams inequalities for high order derivatives on unbounded domains. Our results extend the singular Moser-Trudinger inequalities of first order in \cite{Ad2, R, LR, AdY} to the higher order Sobolev spaces W^{m,\frac{n}{m}} and the results of \cite{RS} on Adams type inequalities in unbounded domains to singular case. Our singular Adams inequality on W^{2,2}(\mathbb{R}^{4}) with standard Sobolev norm at the critical case settles a unsolved question remained in \cite{Y}.
