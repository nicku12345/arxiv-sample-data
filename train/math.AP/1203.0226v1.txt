We study the asymptotic behavior of the Schr\"odinger equation in the presence of a nonlinearity of Hartree type in the semi-classical regime. Our scaling corresponds to a weakly nonlinear regime where the nonlinearity affects the leading order amplitude of the solution without altering the rapid oscillations. We show the validity of the WKB-analysis when the potential in the nonlinearity is singular around the origin. No new resonant wave is created in our model, this phenomenon is inhibited due to the nonlinearity. The nonlocal nature of this latter leads us to build our result on a high-frequency averaging effects. In the proof we make use of the Wiener algebra and the space of square-integrable functions.
