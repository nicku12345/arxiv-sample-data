We consider the Schr\"odinger type operator {\mathcal A}=(1+|x|^{\alpha})\Delta-|x|^{\beta}, for \alpha\in [0,2] and \beta\ge 0. We prove that, for any p\in (1,\infty), the minimal realization of operator {\mathcal A} in L^p(\R^N) generates a strongly continuous analytic semigroup (T_p(t))_{t\ge 0}.   For \alpha\in [0,2) and \beta\ge 2, we then prove some upper estimates for the heat kernel k associated to the semigroup (T_p(t))_{t\ge 0}. As a consequence we obtain an estimate for large |x| of the eigenfunctions of {\mathcal A}. Finally, we extend such estimates to a class of divergence type elliptic operators.
