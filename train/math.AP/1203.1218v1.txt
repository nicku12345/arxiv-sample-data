We consider the operator H:= \partial_t -\Delta+V in 2D or 3D waveguide. With an adapted global Carleman estimate with singular weight functions we give a stability result for the time dependent part of the potential for this particular geometry. Two cases are considered: the bounded waveguide with mixed Dirichlet and Neumann conditions and the open waveguide with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
