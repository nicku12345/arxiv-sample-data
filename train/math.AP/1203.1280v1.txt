We consider a class of nonautonomous second order parabolic equations with unbounded coefficients defined in I\times\R^d, where I is a right-halfline. We prove logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\'e inequalities with respect to an associated evolution system of measures \{\mu_t: t \in I\}, and we deduce hypercontractivity and asymptotic behaviour results for the evolution operator G(t,s).
