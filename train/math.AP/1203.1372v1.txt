In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the tridimensional Boussinesq equations with horizontal dissipation. Under the assumption that the initial data is an axisymmetric without swirl, we prove the global well-posedness for this system. In the absence of vertical dissipation, there is no smoothing effect on the vertical derivatives. To make up this shortcoming, we first establish a magic relationship between \frac{u^{r}}{r} and \frac{\omega_\theta}{r} by taking full advantage of the structure of the axisymmetric fluid without swirl and some tricks in harmonic analysis. This together with the structure of the coupling of \eqref{eq1.1} entails the desired regularity.
