Given a set of transmission eigenvalues, its density function inversely determines the form of the indicator function. This is one application of the Cartwright's theory in inverse problems. We use the indicator function inversely to determine the form of the functional determinant d(z). Such an asymptotic expansion is uniquely determined while considered in constant absorbing medium.
