We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic second-order equations like H(v,Dv,D^{2}v,x)=0 in smooth domains without requiring H to be convex or concave with respect to the second-order derivatives. Apart from ellipticity nothing is required of H at points at which |D^{2}v|\leq K, where K is any given constant. For large |D^{2}v| some kind of relaxed convexity assumption with respect to D^{2}v mixed with a VMO condition with respect to x are still imposed. The solutions are sought in Sobolev classes.
