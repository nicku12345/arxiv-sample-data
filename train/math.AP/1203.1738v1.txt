We analyze the existence of a parameterized stationary solution z(\lambda,z_0)=\big(x(\lambda,z_0), p(\lambda,z_0),\,u(\lambda,z_0)\big)\in D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2n+1},\,\lambda\in B(0,a)\subseteq\mathop{\prod}\limits_{i=1}^{m}[-a_i,a_i], associated with a nonlinear first order PDE, H_0(x,p(x),u(x))=\hbox{constant}\,\,(p(x)=\partial_x u(x)) relying on (a) first integral H\in\mathcal{C}^\infty\big(B(z_0,2\rho)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}\big) and the corresponding Lie algebra of characteristic fields is of the finite type; (b) gradient system in a Lie algebra finitely generated over orbits (f.g.o;z_0) starting from z_0\in D and their nonsingular algebraic representation.
