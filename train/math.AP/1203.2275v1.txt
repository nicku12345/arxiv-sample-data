In this paper, we consider the well-posedness for the Cauchy problem of the Kawahara equation with low regularity data in the periodic case. We obtain the local well-posedness for s \geq -3/2 by a variant of the Fourier restriction norm method. On the other hand, we show the ill-posedness for s <-3/2 in weak sense. Moreover, the local solutions can be extended globally in time for s \geq -1 by the I-method. This is a shape contrast to the results in the non-periodic setting, where the critical exponent is equal to -2.
