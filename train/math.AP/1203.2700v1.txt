We provide a new proof for the global well-posedness of systems coupling fluids and polymers in two space dimensions. Compared to the well-known existing method based on the losing a priori estimates, our method is more direct and much simpler. The co-rotational FENE dumbbell model and the coupling Smoluchowski and Navier-Stokes equations are studied as examples to illustrate our main ideas.
