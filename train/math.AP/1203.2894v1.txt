In this paper, we consider two systems modelling the evolution of a rigid body in an incompressible fluid in a bounded domain of the plane. The first system corresponds to an inviscid fluid driven by the Euler equation whereas the other one corresponds to a viscous fluid driven by the Navier-Stokes system. In both cases we investigate the uniqueness of weak solutions, "\`a la Yudovich" for the Euler case, "\`a la Leray" for the Navier-Stokes case, as long as no collision occurs.
