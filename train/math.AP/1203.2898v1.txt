It was recently proven by De Lellis, Kappeler, and Topalov that the periodic Cauchy problem for the Camassa-Holm equations is locally well-posed in the space Lip (T) endowed with the topology of H^1 (T). We prove here that the Lagrangian flow of these solutions are analytic with respect to time and smooth with respect to the initial data. These results can be adapted to the higher-order Camassa-Holm equations describing the exponential curves of the manifold of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of T using the Riemannian structure induced by the Sobolev inner product H^l (T), for l in N, l > 1 (the classical Camassa-Holm equation corresponds to the case l=1): the periodic Cauchy problem is locally well-posed in the space W^{2l-1,infty} (T) endowed with the topology of H^{2l-1} (T) and the Lagrangian flows of these solutions are analytic with respect to time with values in W^{2l-1,infty} (T) and smooth with respect to the initial data. These results extend some earlier results which dealt with more regular solutions. In particular our results cover the case of peakons, up to the first collision.
