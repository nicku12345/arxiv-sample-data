Two sharp existence and uniqueness theorems are presented for solutions of multiple vortices arising in a six-dimensional brane-world supersymmetric gauge field theory under the general gauge symmetry group G=U(1)\times SU(N) and with N Higgs scalar fields in the fundamental representation of G. Specifically, when the space of extra dimension is compact so that vortices are hosted in a 2-torus of volume |\Om|, the existence of a unique multiple vortex solution representing n_1,...,n_N respectively prescribed vortices arising in the N species of the Higgs fields is established under the explicitly stated necessary and sufficient condition \[ n_i<\frac{g^2v^2}{8\pi N}|\Om|+\frac{1}{N}(1-\frac{1}{N}[\frac{g}{e}]^2)n,\quad i=1,...,N,] where e and g are the U(1) electromagnetic and SU(N) chromatic coupling constants, v measures the energy scale of broken symmetry, and n=\sum_{i=1}^N n_i is the total vortex number; when the space of extra dimension is the full plane, the existence and uniqueness of an arbitrarily prescribed n-vortex solution of finite energy is always ensured. These vortices are governed by a system of nonlinear elliptic equations, which may be reformulated to allow a variational structure. Proofs of existence are then developed using the methods of calculus of variations.
