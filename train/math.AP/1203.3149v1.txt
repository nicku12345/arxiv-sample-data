In this paper we deduce a formula for the fractional Laplace operator   (-\Delta)^{s} on radially symmetric functions useful for some applications. We give a criterion of subharmonicity associated with (-\Delta)^{s}, and apply it to a problem related to the Hessian inequality of Sobolev type: \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}|(-\Delta)^{\frac{k}{k+1}} u|^{k+1} dx \le C \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} - u \, F_k[u] \, dx,  where F_k is the k-Hessian operator on \mathbb{R}^n, 1\le k < \frac{n}{2}, under some restrictions on a k-convex function u. In particular, we show that the class of u for which the above inequality was established in \cite{FFV} contains the extremal functions for the Hessian Sobolev inequality of X.-J. Wang \cite{W1}. This is proved using logarithmic convexity of the Gaussian ratio of hypergeometric functions which might be of independent interest.
