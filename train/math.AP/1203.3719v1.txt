This paper is devoted to the global existence and uniqueness results for the three-dimensional Boussinesq system with axisymmetric initial data v^{0}{\in}B_{2,1}^{5/2}(\RR^3) and {\rho}^{0}{\in}B_{2,1}^{1/2}(\RR^3)\cap L^{p}(\RR^3) with p>6. This system couples the incompressible Euler equations with a transport-diffusion equation governing the density. In this case the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion is not known to be valid and to circumvent this difficulty we use in a crucial way some geometric properties of the vorticity.
