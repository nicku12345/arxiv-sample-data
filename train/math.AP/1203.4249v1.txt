We consider the propagation of wave packets for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, with a matrix-valued potential, in the semi-classical limit. For a matrix-valued potential, Strichartz estimates are available under long range assumptions. Under these assumptions, for an initial coherent state polarized along an eigenvector, we prove that the wave function remains in the same eigenspace, in a scaling such that nonlinear effects cannot be neglected. We also prove a nonlinear superposition principle for these nonlinear wave packets.
