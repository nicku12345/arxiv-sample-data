In this paper, we are concerned with the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity \mu(\rho)=\rho^\alpha (\alpha>0) and pressure P(\rho)=\rho^{\gamma}\ (\gamma>1). We will establish the global existence and asymptotic behavior of weak solutions for any \alpha>0 and \gamma>1 under the assumption that the density function keeps a constant state at far fields. This enlarges the ranges of \alpha and \gamma and improves the previous results presented by Jiu and Xin. As a result, in the case that 0<\alpha<\frac12, we obtain the large time behavior of the strong solution obtained by Mellet and Vasseur when the solution has a lower bound (no vacuum).
