We construct a one parameter family of finite time blow ups to the co-rotational wave maps problem from S^2\times \RR to S^2, parameterized by \nu\in(1/2,1]. The longitudinal function u(t,\alpha) which is the main object of study will be obtained as a perturbation of a rescaled harmonic map of rotation index one from \RR^2 to S^2. The domain of this harmonic map is identified with a neighborhood of the north pole in the domain S^2 via the exponential coordinates (\alpha,\theta). In these coordinates u(t,\alpha)=Q(\lambda(t)\alpha)+\mathcal{R}(t,\alpha), where Q(r)=2\arctan{r}, is the standard co-rotational harmonic map to the sphere, \lambda(t)=t^{-1-\nu}, and \mathcal{R}(t,\alpha) is the error with local energy going to zero as t\rightarrow 0. Blow up will occur at (t,\alpha)=(0,0) due to energy concentration, and up to this point the solution will have regularity H^{1+\nu-}.
