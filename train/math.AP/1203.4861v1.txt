We prove boundedness of gradients of solutions to quasilinear parabolic system, the main part of which is a generalization to p-Laplacian and its right hand side's growth depending on gradient is not slower (and generally strictly faster) than p - 1. This result may be seen as a generalization to the classical notion of a controllable growth of right hand side, introduced by Campanato, over gradients of p-Laplacian-like systems. Energy estimates and nonlinear iteration procedure of a Moser type are cornerstones of the used method.
