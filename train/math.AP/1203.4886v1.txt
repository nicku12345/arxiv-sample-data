We analyze the blowup behaviour of solutions to the focusing nonlinear Klein--Gordon equation in spatial dimensions d\geq 2. We obtain upper bounds on the blowup rate, both globally in space and in light cones. The results are sharp in the conformal and sub-conformal cases. The argument relies on Lyapunov functionals derived from the dilation identity. We also prove that the critical Sobolev norm diverges near the blowup time.
