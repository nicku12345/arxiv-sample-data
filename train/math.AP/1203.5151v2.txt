We investigate the role of convection on its large time behavior of 3D incompressible Euler equations. In \cite{HL09a}, we constructed a new 3D model by neglecting the convection term from the reformulated axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. This model preserves almost all the properties of the full Navier-Stokes equations, including an energy identity for smooth solutions. The numerical evidence presented in \cite{HL09a} seems to support that the 3D model may develop a finite time singularity. In this paper, we prove rigorously that the 3D inviscid model develops a finite time singularity for a family of smooth initial data whose energy is finite and conserved in time.
