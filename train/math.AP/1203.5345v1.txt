This paper is concerned with the study of solutions to discrete parabolic equations in divergence form with random coefficients, and their convergence to solutions of a homogenized equation. It has previously been shown that if the random environment is translational invariant and ergodic, then solutions of the random equation converge under diffusive scaling to solutions of a homogenized parabolic PDE. In this paper point-wise estimates are obtained on the difference between the averaged solution to the random equation and the solution to the homogenized equation for certain random environments which are strongly mixing.
