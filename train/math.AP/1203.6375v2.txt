We consider the mass critical NLS on \mathbb{T} and \mathbb{T}^2. In the \mathbb{R}^d case the Strichartz estimates enable us to show well-posedness of the IVP in L^2 (at least for small data) via the Picard iteration method. However, counterexamples to the L^6 Strichartz on \mathbb{T} and the L^4 Strichartz on \mathbb{T}^2 were given by Bourgain (1993) and Takaoka-Tzvetkov (2001), respectively, which means that the Strichartz spaces are not suitable for iteration in these problems. In this note, we show a slightly stronger result, namely, that the IVP on \mathbb{T} and \mathbb{T}^2 cannot have a smooth data-to-solution map in L^2 even for small initial data. The same results are also obtained for most of the two dimensional irrational tori.
