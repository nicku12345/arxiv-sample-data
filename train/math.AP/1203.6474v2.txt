Let X_1,...,X_q be the basis of the space of horizontal vector fields on a homogeneous Carnot group in R^n (q<n). We consider a degenerate elliptic system of N equations, in divergence form, structured on these vector fields, where the coefficients a_{ab}^{ij} (i,j=1,2,...,q, a,b=1,2,...,N) are real valued bounded measurable functions defined in a bounded domain A of R^n, satisfying the strong Legendre condition and belonging to the space VMO_{loc}(A) (defined by the Carnot-Caratheodory distance induced by the X_i's). We prove interior HW^{1,p} estimates (2<p<\infty) for weak solutions to the system.
