In this paper we prove some multi-linear Strichartz estimates for solutions to the linear Schr\"odinger equations on torus \T^n. Then we apply it to get some local well-posed results for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in critical H^{s}(\T^n) spaces. As by-products, the energy critical global well-posed results and energy subcritical global well-posed results with small initial data are also obtained.
