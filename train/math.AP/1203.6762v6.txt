A mechanism deriving new well-posed evolutionary equations from given ones is inspected. It turns out that there is one particular spatial operator from which many of the standard evolutionary problems of mathematical physics can be generated by this abstract mechanism using suitable projections. The complexity of the dynamics of the phenomena considered can be described in terms of suitable material laws. The idea is illustrated with a number of concrete examples.
