We consider systems of semilinear wave equations in three space dimensions with quadratic nonlinear terms not satisfying the null condition. We prove small data global existence of the classical solution under a new structural condition related to the weak null condition. For two-component systems satisfying this condition, we also observe a new kind of asymptotic behavior: Only one component is dissipated and the other one behaves like a free solution in the large time.
