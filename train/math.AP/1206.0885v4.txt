In this paper we prove an invariant Harnack inequality on Carnot-Carath\'eodory balls for fractional powers of sub-Laplacians in Carnot groups. The proof relies on an "abstract" formulation of a technique recently introduced by Caffarelli and Silvestre. In addition, we write explicitly the Poisson kernel for a class of degenerate subelliptic equations in product-type Carnot groups.
