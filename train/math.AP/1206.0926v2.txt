In this paper we consider the pointwise convergence to the initial data for the Schr\"{o}dinger-Dirac equation i\tfrac{\partial u}{\partial t}=D^{\beta}u with u(x,0)=u^0 in a dyadic Besov space. Here D^{\beta} denotes the fractional derivative of order \beta associated to the dyadic distance \delta on \mathbb{R}^+. The main tools are a sumability formula for the kernel of D^{\beta} and pointwise estimates of the corresponding maximal operator in terms of the dyadic Hardy-Littlewood function and the Calder\'on sharp maximal operator.
