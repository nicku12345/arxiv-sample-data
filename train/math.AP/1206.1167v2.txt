We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the heat equation in nonhomogeneous media with critical singular density  |x|^{-2}\partial_{t}u=\Delta u, \quad \hbox{in} \ \real^N\times(0,\infty).  The asymptotic behavior proves to have some interesting and quite striking properties. We show that there are two completely different asymptotic profiles depending on whether the initial data u_0 vanishes at x=0 or not. Moreover, in the former the results are true only for radially symmetric solutions, and we provide counterexamples to convergence to symmetric profiles in the general case.
