We study the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the doubly nonlinear equation u_t = \Delta_p u^m, where p>1,\ m>0 posed in a bounded domain in \mathbb{R}^N with homogeneous boundary conditions and with non-negative and integrable data. In this paper we consider the degenerate case m(p-1)>1 and the quasilinear case m(p-1)=1. We establish the large-time behaviour by proving the uniform convergence to a unique asymptotic profile and we also give rates for this convergence.
