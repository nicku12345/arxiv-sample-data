This note is devoted to several inequalities deduced from a special form of the logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev, which is well adapted to the characterization of stationary solutions of a Keller-Segel system written in self-similar variables, in case of a subcritical mass. For the corresponding evolution problem, such functional inequalities play an important role for identifying the rate of convergence of the solutions towards the stationary solution with same mass.
