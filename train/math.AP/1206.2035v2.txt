We consider an incompressible viscous flow without surface tension in a finite- depth domain of three dimension, with free top boundary. This system is governed by a Naiver-Stokes equation in a moving domain and a transport equation for the top boundary. Traditionally, we consider this problem in Lagrangian coordinate and perturbed linear form. In [1], I. Tice and Y. Guo introduced a new framework using geometric structure in Eulerian coordinate to study both local and global wellposedness of this system. Following this path, we extend their result in local wellposedness from small data case to arbitrary data case. Other than the geometric energy estimate and time-dependent Galerkin method introduced in [1], we utilize a few new techniques: (1) using parameterized Poisson integral to construct a nontrivial transform between fixed domain and moving domain; (2) using bootstrapping argument to prove a comparison result for steady Navier-Stokes equation for arbitrary data of free surface.
