We examine the two elliptic systems given by [(G)_{\lambda,\gamma} \quad -\Delta u = \lambda f'(u) g(v), \quad -\Delta v = \gamma f(u) g'(v) \quad in  \Omega,] and [(H)_{\lambda,\gamma} \quad -\Delta u = \lambda f(u) g'(v), \quad -\Delta v = \gamma f'(u) g(v) \quad in  \Omega},] with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions and where  \lambda,\gamma are positive parameters. We show that for arbitrary nonlinearities f and g that the extremal solutions associated with  (G)_{\lambda,\gamma} are bounded provided  \Omega is a convex domain in  \mathbb R^N where  N \le 3. In the case of a radial domain we show the extremal solutions are bounded provided  N <10. The extremal solutions associated with  (H)_{\lambda,\gamma} are bounded in the case where  f is arbitrary,  g(v)=(v+1)^q where  1 <q<\infty and where  \Omega is a bounded convex domain in  \mathbb R^N,  N \le 3. Results are also obtained in higher dimensions for  (G)_{\lambda,\gamma} and (H)_{\lambda,\gamma} for the case of explicit nonlinearities of the form  f(u)=(u+1)^p and  g(v)=(v+1)^q.
