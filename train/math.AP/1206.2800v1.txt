We consider rotationally symmetric p-harmonic maps from the unit disk D^2\subset\real^2 to the unit sphere S^2\subset\real^3, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions and with 1<p<\infty. We show that the associated energy functional admits a unique minimizer which is of class C^{\infty} in the interior and C^1 up to the boundary. We also show that there exist infinitely many global solutions to the associated Euler-Lagrange equation and we completely characterize them.
