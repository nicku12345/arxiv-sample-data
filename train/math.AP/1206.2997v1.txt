We consider Schroedinger operators on metric cones whose cross section is a closed Riemannian manifold (Y, h) of dimension d-1 \geq 2. Thus the metric on the cone M = (0, \infty)_r \times Y is dr^2 + r^2 h. Let \Delta be the Friedrichs Laplacian on M and V_0 be a smooth function on Y, such that \Delta_Y + V_0 + (d-2)^2/4 is a strictly positive operator on L^2(Y), with lowest eigenvalue \mu^2_0  and second lowest eigenvalue \mu^2_1, with \mu_0, \mu_1 > 0. The operator we consider is H = \Delta + V_0/r^2, a Schr\"odinger operator with inverse square potential on M; notice that H is homogeneous of degree -2.   We study the Riesz transform T = \nabla H^{-1/2} and determine the precise range of p for which T is bounded on L^p(M). This is achieved by making a precise analysis of the operator (H + 1)^{-1} and determining the complete asymptotics of its integral kernel. We prove that if V is not identically zero, then the range of p for L^p boundedness is    d/ \Big(min(1+d/2+\mu_0, d \Big) < p < d / \Big(max(d/2-\mu_0, 0) \Big), while if V is identically zero, then the range is    1 < p < d / \Big(max(d/2-\mu_1, 0 \Big).   The result in the case V identically zero was first obtained in a paper by H.-Q. Li.
