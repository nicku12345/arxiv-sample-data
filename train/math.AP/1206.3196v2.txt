For a domain \Omega\subset\dR^N we consider the equation  -\Delta u + V(x)u = Q_n(x)\abs{u}^{p-2}u with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions and p\in(2,2^*). Here V\ge 0 and Q_n are bounded functions that are positive in a region contained in \Omega and negative outside, and such that the sets \{Q_n>0\} shrink to a point x_0\in\Omega as n\to\infty. We show that if u_n is a nontrivial solution corresponding to Q_n, then the sequence (u_n) concentrates at x_0 with respect to the H^1 and certain L^q-norms. We also show that if the sets \{Q_n>0\} shrink to two points and u_n are ground state solutions, then they concentrate at one of these points.
