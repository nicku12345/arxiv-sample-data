This paper considers the initial boundary problem to the planar compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with large initial data and vacuum. The global existence and uniqueness of large strong solutions are established when the heat conductivity coefficient \kappa(\theta) satisfies \begin{equation*} C_{1}(1+\theta^q)\leq \kappa(\theta)\leq C_2(1+\theta^q) \end{equation*} for some constants q>0, and C_1,C_2>0.
