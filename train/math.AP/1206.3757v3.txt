We prove results on solvability of nonlinear elliptic partial differential systems of principle type of second order. They are consequences of existence of non-radial solutions for nonlinear partial differential systems of Poisson type. As applications to geometry, we prove the exsitence of local harmonic maps with given tangent plane at a point between any Riemannan manifolds. More generally geometric objects defined by Beltrami-Laplace always exist locally.
