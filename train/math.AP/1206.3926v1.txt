In this paper we prove symmetry results for classical solutions of nonlinear cooperative elliptic systems in a ball or in annulus in \RN, N \geq 2 . More precisely we prove that solutions having Morse index j \leq N  are foliated Schwarz symmetric if the nonlinearity is convex and a full coupling condition is satisfied along the solution.
