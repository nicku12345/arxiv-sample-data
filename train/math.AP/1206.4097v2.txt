In this article, we consider a special class of initial data to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations on the torus, in which there is a certain degree of orthogonality in the components of the initial data. We showed that, under such conditions, the Navier-Stokes equations are globally wellposed. We also showed that there exists large initial data, in the sense of the critical norm B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty} that satisfies the conditions that we considered.
