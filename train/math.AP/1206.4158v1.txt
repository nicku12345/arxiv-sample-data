We prove that negative energy solutions of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation e^{-i\theta} u_t = \Delta u+ |u|^{\alpha} u blow up in finite time, where \alpha >0 and \pi /2<\theta <\pi /2. For a fixed initial value u(0), we obtain estimates of the blow-up time T_{max}^\theta  as \theta \to \pm \pi /2 . It turns out that T_{max}^\theta  stays bounded (respectively, goes to infinity) as \theta \to \pm \pi /2  in the case where the solution of the limiting nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation blows up in finite time (respectively, is global).
