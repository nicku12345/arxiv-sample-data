We examine the system given by \hfill -\Delta u = \lambda (v+1)^p \qquad \Omega \hfill -\Delta v = \gamma (u+1)^\theta \qquad \Omega, \hfill u = v =0 \qquad \quad \partial \Omega, where  \lambda,\gamma are positive parameters and where  1 < p \le \theta and where  \Omega is a smooth bounded domain in  R^N. We show the extremal solutions associated with the above system are bounded provided   [\frac{N}{2} < 1 + \frac{2(\theta+1)}{p\theta -1} (\sqrt{\frac{p \theta (p+1)}{\theta +1}} + \sqrt{\frac{p \theta (p+1)}{\theta +1} - \sqrt{\frac{p \theta (p+1)}{\theta +1}}})]
