In this paper we prove existence and multiplicity of positive and sign-changing solutions to the pure critical exponent problem for the p-Laplacian operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded domain having nontrivial topology and discrete symmetry. Pioneering works related to the case p=2 are H. Brezis and L. Nirenberg [4], J.-M. Coron [10], and A. Bahri and J.-M. Coron [3]. A global compactness analysis is given for the Palais-Smale sequences in the presence of symmetries.
