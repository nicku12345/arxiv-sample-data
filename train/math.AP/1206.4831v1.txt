We study linear closure relations for the moments' method applied to simple kinetic equations. The equations are linear collisional models (velocity jump processes) which are well suited to this type of approximation. In this simplified, 1 dimensional setting, we are able to prove stability estimates for the method (with a kinetic interpretation by a BGK model). Moreover we are also able to obtain convergence rates which automatically increase with the smoothness of the initial data.
