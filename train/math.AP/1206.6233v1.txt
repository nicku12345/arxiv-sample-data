In this paper we establish the boundedness of the extremal solution u^* in dimension N=4 of the semilinear elliptic equation -\Delta u=\lambda f(u), in a general smooth bounded domain Omega of R^N, with Dirichlet data u|_{\partial \Omega}=0, where f is a C^1 positive, nondecreasing and convex function in [0,\infty) such that f(s)/s\rightarrow\infty as s\rightarrow\infty.   In addition, we prove that, for N>=5, the extremal solution u^*\in W^{2,\frac{N}{N-2}}. This gives u^\ast\in L^\frac{N}{N-4}, if N>=5 and u^*\in H_0^1, if N=6.
