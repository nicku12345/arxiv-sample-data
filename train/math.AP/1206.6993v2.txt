We give an example of a relation between local and effective properties for elastic structures, up to geometric constants. The model considered is a periodic structure with isotropic and homogeneous local elasticity tensor in planar linear elasticity. The corresponding physical model is a flat two dimensional body with holes as, for example, a perforated plate.
