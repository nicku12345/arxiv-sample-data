A coupled quantum-classical model describing the transport of electrons confined in nanoscale semiconductor devices is considered. Using the subband decomposition approach allows to separate the transport directions from the confinement direction. The motion of the gas in the transport direction is assumed to be classical. Then a hierarchy of adiabatic quantum-classical model is obtained, leading to subband SHE and energy-transport models, with explicit expression of the diffusion coefficients. The energy-transport-Schr\"odinger-Poisson model is then used for the numerical simulation of the transport of the electron gas in an ultra-scaled Double-Gate-MOSFET.
