We consider a one-dimensional nonlocal nonlinear equation of the form: \partial_t u = (\Lambda^{-\alpha} u)\partial_x u - \nu \Lambda^{\beta}u where \Lambda =(-\partial_{xx})^{\frac 12} is the fractional Laplacian and \nu\ge 0 is the viscosity coefficient. We consider primarily the regime 0<\alpha<1 and 0\le \beta \le 2 for which the model has nonlocal drift, fractional dissipation, and captures essential features of the 2D \alpha-patch models. In the critical and subcritical range 1-\alpha\le \beta \le 2, we prove global wellposedness for arbitrarily large initial data in Sobolev spaces. In the full supercritical range 0 \le \beta<1-\alpha, we prove formation of singularities in finite time for a class of smooth initial data. Our proof is based on a novel nonlocal weighted inequality which can be of independent interest.
