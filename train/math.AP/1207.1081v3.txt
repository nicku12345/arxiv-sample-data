We examine the elliptic system given by {equation} \label{system_abstract}   -\Delta u = v^p, \qquad -\Delta v = u^\theta, \qquad \{in} \IR^N, {equation} for  1 < p \le \theta and the fourth order scalar equation {equation} \label{fourth_abstract} \Delta^2 u = u^\theta, \qquad \{in  \IR^N,} {equation} where  1 < \theta. We prove various Liouville type theorems for positive stable solutions. For instance we show there are no positive stable solutions of (\ref{system_abstract}) (resp. (\ref{fourth_abstract})) provided  N \le 10 and  2 \le p \le \theta (resp.  N \le 10 and 1 < \theta). Results for higher dimensions are also obtained.   These results regarding stable solutions on the full space imply various Liouville theorems for positive (possibly unstable) bounded solutions of   {equation} \label{eq_half_abstract}   -\Delta u = v^p, \qquad -\Delta v = u^\theta, \qquad \{in} \IR^{N-1}, {equation} with  u=v=0 on  \partial \IR^N_+. In particular there is no positive bounded solution of (\ref{eq_half_abstract}) for any  2 \le p \le \theta if  N \le 11. Higher dimensional results are also obtained.
