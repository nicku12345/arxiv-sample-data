Under suitable conditions, we obtain some characterization of supercontractivity, ultraboundedness and ultracontractivity of the evolution operator G(t,s) associated to a class of nonautonomous second order parabolic equations with unbounded coefficients defined in I\times\R^d, where I is a right-halfline. For this purpose, we establish an Harnack type estimate for G(t,s) and a family of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with respect to the unique tight evolution system of measures \{\mu_t: t \in I\} associated to G(t,s). Sufficient conditions for the supercontractivity, ultraboundedness and ultracontractivity to hold are also provided.
