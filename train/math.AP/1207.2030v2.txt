In this paper, we establish a generalized H{\"o}lder's or interpolation inequality for weighted spaces in which the weights are non-necessarily homogeneous. We apply it to the stabilization of some damped wave-like evolution equations. This allows obtaining explicit decay rates for smooth solutions for more general classes of damping operators. In particular, for 1-d models, we can give an explicit decay estimate for pointwise damping mechanisms supported on any strategic point.
