In this paper, we consider global solutions for the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation iu_t+\Delta u+\lambda|u|^\alpha u=0, in \R^N, with \lambda\in\R and 0\le\alpha<\frac{4}{N-2} (0\le\alpha<\infty if N=1). We show that no nontrivial solution can decay faster than the solutions of the free Schr\"odinger equation, provided that u(0) lies in the weighted Sobolev space H^1(\R^N)\cap L^2(|x|^2;dx), in the energy space, namely H^1(\R^N), or in L^2(\R^N), according to the different cases.
