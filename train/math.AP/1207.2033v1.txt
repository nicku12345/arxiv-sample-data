In this paper, we consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the super critical power of nonlinearity in the attractive case. We give a sufficient condition and a necessary condition to obtain global or blowing up solutions. These conditions coincide in the critical case, thereby extending the results of Weinstein. Furthermore, we improve a blow-up condition.
