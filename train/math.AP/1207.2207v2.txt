We study the large time behavior of solutions near a constant equilibrium to the compressible Euler-Maxwell system in \r3. We first refine a global existence theorem by assuming that the H^3 norm of the initial data is small, but the higher order derivatives can be arbitrarily large. If the initial data belongs to \Dot{H}^{-s} (0\le s<3/2) or \dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{-s} (0<s\le3/2), by a regularity interpolation trick, we obtain the various decay rates of the solution and its higher order derivatives. As an immediate byproduct, the usual L^p--L^2 (1\le p\le 2) type of the decay rates follow without requiring that the L^p norm of initial data is small.
