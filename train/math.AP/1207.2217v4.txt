We prove the existence of both local and global smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem in \R^3 for the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system. We also prove that the solution to the incompressible MHD system can be obtained as the incompressible limit of the corresponding compressible system. We apply methods in extracting weak dissipative structure which were suggested by Lei-Liu-Zhou.
