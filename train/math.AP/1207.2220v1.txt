We study an initial boundary value problem for the 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations of compressible fluids in \R^3. We establish a blow-up criterion for the local strong solutions in terms of the density and magnetic field. Namely, if the density is away from vacuum (\rho= 0) and the concentration of mass (\rho=\infty) and if the magnetic field is bounded above in terms of L^\infty-norm, then a local strong solution can be continued globally in time.
