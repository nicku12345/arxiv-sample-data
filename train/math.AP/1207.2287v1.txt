The energy production through thermo-nuclear fusion requires the confinement of the plasma into a bounded domain. In most of the cases, such configurations are obtained by using strong magnetic fields. Several models exist for describing the evolution of a strongly magnetized plasma, i.e., guiding-center approximation, finite Larmor radius regime, etc. The topic of this paper concerns a different approach leading to plasma confinement. More exactly we are interested in mathematical models with fast oscillating magnetic fields. We provide rigorous derivations for this kind of models and analyze their properties.
