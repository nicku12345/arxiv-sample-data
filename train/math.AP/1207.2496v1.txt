We establish a Liouville comparison principle for entire weak sub- and super-solutions of the equation (\ast) w_t-\Delta_p (w) = |w|^{q-1}w in the half-space {\mathbb S}= {\mathbb R}^1_+\times {\mathbb R}^n, where n\geq 1, q>0 and  \Delta_p (w):={div}_x(|\nabla_x w|^{p-2}\nabla_x w), 1<p\leq 2. In our study we impose neither restrictions on the behaviour of entire weak sub- and super-solutions on the hyper-plane t=0, nor any growth conditions on their behaviour and on that of any of their partial derivatives at infinity. We prove that if 1<q\leq p-1+\frac pn, and u and v are, respectively, an entire weak super-solution and an entire weak sub-solution of (\ast) in \Bbb S which belong, only locally in \Bbb S, to the corresponding Sobolev space and are such that u\geq v, then u\equiv v. The result is sharp. As direct corollaries we obtain known Fujita-type and Liouville-type theorems.
