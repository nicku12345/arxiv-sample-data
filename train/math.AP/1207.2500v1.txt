We obtain a new Liouville comparison principle for entire weak solutions (u,v) of semilinear parabolic second-order partial differential inequalities of the form  u_t -{\mathcal L}u- |u|^{q-1}u\geq v_t -{\mathcal L}v- |v|^{q-1}v (*)  in the half-space {\mathbb S} = {\mathbb R}^1_+ \times \mathbb R^n. Here n\geq 1, q>0 and  {\mathcal L}=\sum\limits_{i,j=1}^n\frac{\partial}{{\partial}x_i} [ a_{ij}(t, x) \frac{\partial}{{\partial}x_j}], where a_{ij}(t,x), i,j=1,...,n, are functions defined, measurable and locally bounded in \mathbb S, and such that a_{ij}(t,x)=a_{ji}(t,x) and  \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}(t,x)\xi_i\xi_j\geq 0  for almost all (t,x)\in \mathbb S and all \xi \in \mathbb R^n. The critical exponents in the Liouville comparison principle obtained, which responsible for the non-existence of non-trivial (i.e., such that u\not \equiv v) entire weak solutions to (*) in \mathbb S, depend on the behaviour of the coefficients of the operator \mathcal L at infinity. As direct corollaries we obtain a new Fujita comparison principle for entire weak solutions (u,v) of the Cauchy problem for the inequality (*), as well as new Liouville-type and Fujita-type theorems for non-negative entire weak solutions u of the inequality (*) in the case when v\equiv 0. All the results obtained are new and sharp.
