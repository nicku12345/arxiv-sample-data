In this paper we obtain bounds for the decay rate in the L^r (\rr^d)-norm for the solutions to a nonlocal and nolinear evolution equation, namely, u_t(x,t) = \int_{\rr^d} K(x,y) |u(y,t)- u(x,t)|^{p-2} (u(y,t)- u(x,t)) \, dy,  with  x \in \rr^d,  t>0. Here we consider a kernel K(x,y) of the form K(x,y)=\psi (y-a(x))+\psi(x-a(y)), where \psi is a bounded, nonnegative function supported in the unit ball and a is a linear function a(x)= Ax. To obtain the decay rates we derive lower and upper bounds for the first eigenvalue of a nonlocal diffusion operator of the form  T(u) = - \int_{\rr^d} K(x,y) |u(y)-u(x)|^{p-2} (u(y)-u(x)) \, dy, with 1 \leq p < \infty. The upper and lower bounds that we obtain are sharp and provide an explicit expression for the first eigenvalue in the whole \rr^d:  \lambda_{1,p} (\rr^d) = 2(\int_{\rr^d} \psi (z) \, dz)|\frac{1}{|\det{A}|^{1/p}} -1|^p.  Moreover, we deal with the p=\infty eigenvalue problem studying the limit as p \to \infty of \lambda_{1,p}^{1/p}.
