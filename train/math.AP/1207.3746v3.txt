For smooth initial data, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong and classical solutions to the Cauchy problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two spatial dimensions with vacuum state as far field and with no restrictions on the size of initial data provided the shear viscosity is a positive constant and the bulk one is \lambda = \rho^{\beta} with \beta>4/3.
