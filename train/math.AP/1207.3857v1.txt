We construct and justify leading order weakly nonlinear geometric optics expansions for nonlinear hyperbolic initial value problems, including the compressible Euler equations. The technique of simultaneous Picard iteration is employed to show approximate solutions tend to the exact solutions in the small wavelength limit. Recent work [2] by Coulombel, Gues, and Williams studied the case of reflecting wave trains whose expansions involve only real phases. We treat generic boundary frequencies by incorporating into our expansions both real and nonreal phases. Nonreal phases introduce difficulties such as approximately solving complex transport equations and result in the addition of boundary layers with exponential decay. This also prevents us from doing an error analysis based on almost-periodic profiles as in [2].
