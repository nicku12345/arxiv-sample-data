In recent years, a number of experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the mechanical behavior of water-saturated biological tissues like articular cartilage under dynamic loading. For in vivo measurements of tissue viability, the indentation tests with the half-sinusoidal loading history were proposed. In the present paper, the sinusoidally-driven compression test utilizing either the load-controlled or displacement-controlled loading protocol are considered in the framework of linear biphasic layer model. Closed-form analytical solutions for the integral characteristics of the compression test are obtained.
