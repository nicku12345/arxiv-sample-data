We study static 180 degree domain walls in infinite magnetic wires with bounded, C^1 and rotationally symmetric cross sections. We prove an existence of global minimizers for the energy of micromagnetics for any bounded C^1 cross sections. Under some asymmetry of cross sections we prove a stability result for the minimizers, namely, we show that vectors of micromagnetics having an energy close to the minimal one, must be H^1 close to a minimizer of the limiting energy up to a rotation and a translation.
