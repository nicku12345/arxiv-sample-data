Consider a discrete uniformly elliptic divergence form equation on the d dimensional lattice \Z^d with random coefficients. In [3] rate of convergence results in homogenization and estimates on the difference between the averaged Green's function and the homogenized Green's function for random environments which satisfy a Poincar\'{e} inequality were obtained. Here these results are extended to certain environments with long range correlations. These environments are simply related via a convolution to environments which do satisfy a Poincar\'{e} inequality.
