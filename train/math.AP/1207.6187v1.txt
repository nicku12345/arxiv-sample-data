We study the local and global wellposedness of a full system of Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic equations. The system is a coupling of the forced (Lorentz force) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Maxwell equations through Ohm's law for the current. We show the local existence of mild solutions for arbitrarily large data in a space similar to the scale invariant spaces classically used for Navier-Stokes. These solutions are global if the initial data are small enough.
