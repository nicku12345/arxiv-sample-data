For every f \in L^N(\Omega) defined in an open bounded subset \Omega of \mathbb{R}^N, we prove that a solution u \in W_0^{1, 1}(\Omega) of the 1-Laplacian equation {-}\mathrm{div}{(\frac{\nabla u}{|\nabla u|})} = f in \Omega satisfies \nabla u = 0 on a set of positive Lebesgue measure. The same property holds if f \not\in L^N(\Omega) has small norm in the Marcinkiewicz space of weak-L^{N} functions or if u is a BV minimizer of the associated energy functional. The proofs rely on Stampacchia's truncation method.
