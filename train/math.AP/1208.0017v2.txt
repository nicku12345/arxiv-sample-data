In this paper we establish the existence of bound state solutions of any given order to  \Delta_m u +f(u)=0, x\in R^N, N\ge m>1, (P)  where \Delta_m u=\nabla\cdot(|\nabla u|^{m-2}\nabla u) using the same techniques as in [GST] to establish the existence of a ground state solution to (P). Since our solutions change sign, we assume f is continuous in R. The main point here is that by asking a stronger subcritical assumption (see (f_3)(ii) below) than the one considered in [GST], we are able to adapt their techniques to obtain the existence of bound states with a prescribed number of zeros.
