In this article, the uniqueness of weak solutions to the continuous coagulation and multiple fragmentation equation is proved for a large range of unbounded coagulation and multiple fragmentation kernels. The multiple fragmentation kernels may have a singularity at origin. This work generalizes the preceding ones, by including some physically relevant coagulation and fragmentation kernels which were not considered before.
