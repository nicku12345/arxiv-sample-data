The paper studies eigenfunctions for the scalar field equation on \R^N at the second minimax level \lambda_2. Similarly to the well-studied case of the ground state, there is a threshold level \lambda^# such that \lambda_2\le \lambda^#, and a critical point at the level \lambda_2 exists if the inequality is strict. Unlike the case of the ground state, the level \lambda_2 is not attained in autonomous problems, and the existence is shown when the potential near infinity approaches the constant level from below not faster than e^{- \varepsilon |x|}. The paper also considers questions about the nodal character and the symmetry breaking for solutions at the level \lambda_2.
