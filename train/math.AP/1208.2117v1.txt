The mean value inequality is characteristic for upper semicontinuous functions to be subharmonic. Quasinearly subharmonic functions generalize subharmonic functions. We find the necessary and sufficient conditions under which subsets of balls are big enough for the catheterization of nonnegative, quasinearly subharmonic functions by mean value inequalities. Similar result is obtained also for generalized mean value inequalities where, instead of balls, we consider arbitrary bounded sets which have nonvoid interiors and instead of the volume of ball some functions depending on the radius of this ball.
