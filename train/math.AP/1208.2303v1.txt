We study, under the radial symmetry assumption, the solutions to the fractional Schr\"odinger equations of critical nonlinearity in \mathbb R^{1+d}, d \geq 2, with L\'{e}vy index {2d}/({2d-1}) < \al < 2. We firstly prove the linear profile decomposition and then apply it to investigate the properties of the blowup solutions of the nonlinear equations with mass-critical Hartree type nonlineartity.
