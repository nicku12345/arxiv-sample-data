In this paper we consider a variational problem related to a model for a nucleon interacting with the \omega and \sigma mesons in the atomic nucleus. The model is relativistic, and we study it in a nuclear physics nonrelativistic limit, which is of a very different nature than the nonrelativistic limit in the atomic physics. Ground states are shown to exist for a large class of values for the parameters of the problem, which are determined by the values of some physical constants.
