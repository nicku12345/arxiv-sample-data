In this article we discuss the solvability of some class of fully nonlinear equations, and equations with p-Laplacian in more general conditions by using a new approach given in [1] for studying the nonlinear continuous operator. Moreover we reduce certain general results for the continuous operators acting on Banach spaces, and investigate their image. Here we also consider the existence of a fixed-point of the continuous operators under various conditions.
