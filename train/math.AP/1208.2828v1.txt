We prove that arbitrary superharmonic functions and superparabolic functions related to the p-Laplace and the p-parabolic equations are locally obtained as limits of supersolutions with desired convergence properties of the corresponding Riesz measures. As an application we show that a family of uniformly bounded supersolutions to the p-parabolic equation contains a subsequence that converges to a supersolution.
