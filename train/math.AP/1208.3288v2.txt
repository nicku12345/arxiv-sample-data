Some properties of characteristic curves in connection with viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations defined by Hopf-type formula are studied. We investigate the points where the Hopf-type formula u(t,x) is differentiable, and the strip of the form (0,t_0)\times \R^n of the domain \Omega where the viscosity solution u(t,x) is continuously differentiable. Moreover, we present the propagation of singularity in forward of u(t,x).
