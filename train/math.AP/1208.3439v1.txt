We study initial boundary value problems for the convective Cahn-Hilliard equation \Dt u +\px^4u +u\px u+\px^2(|u|^pu)=0. It is well-known that without the convective term, the solutions of this equation may blow up in finite time for any p>0. In contrast to that, we show that the presence of the convective term u\px u in the Cahn-Hilliard equation prevents blow up at least for 0<p<\frac49. We also show that the blowing up solutions still exist if p is large enough (p\ge2). The related equations like Kolmogorov-Sivashinsky-Spiegel equation, sixth order convective Cahn-Hilliard equation, are also considered.
