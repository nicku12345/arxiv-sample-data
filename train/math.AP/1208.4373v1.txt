We show that for any uniformly parabolic fully nonlinear second-order equation with bounded measurable "coefficients" and bounded "free" term in any cylindrical smooth domain with smooth boundary data one can find an approximating equation which has a unique continuous solution with the first derivatives bounded and the second spacial derivatives locally bounded. The approximating equation is constructed in such a way that it modifies the original one only for large values of the unknown function and its spacial derivatives.
