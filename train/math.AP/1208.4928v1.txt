We present some new regularity criteria for suitable weak solutions of magnetohydrodynamic equations near boundary in dimension three. We prove that suitable weak solutions are H\"older continuous near boundary provided that either the scaled L^{p,q}_{x,t}-norm of the velocity with 3/p+2/q\le 2, 2<q<\infty, or the scaled L^{p,q}_{x,t}-norm of the vorticity with 3/p+2/q\le 3, 2<q<\infty are sufficiently small near the boundary.
