Let \Omega\subset \R^n be a bounded convex domain and \phi\in C(\bar\Omega) be a convex function such that \phi is sufficiently smooth on \partial\Omega and the Monge--Amp\`ere measure \det D^2\phi is bounded away from zero and infinity in \Omega. The corresponding linearized Monge--Amp\`ere equation is \[ \trace(\Phi D^2 u) =f, \] where \Phi := \det D^2 \phi ~ (D^2\phi)^{-1} is the matrix of cofactors of D^2\phi. We prove a conjecture in \cite{GT} about the relationship between L^p estimates for D^2 u and the closeness between \det D^2\phi and one. As a consequence, we obtain interior W^{2,p} estimates for solutions to such equation whenever the measure \det D^2\phi is given by a continuous density and the function f belongs to L^q(\Omega) for some q> \max{\{p,n\}}.
