We study the relevance of various scalar equations, such as inviscid Burgers', Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), extended KdV, and higher order equations (of Camassa-Holm type), as asymptotic models for the propagation of internal waves in a two-fluid system. These scalar evolution equations may be justified with two approaches. The first method consists in approximating the flow with two decoupled, counterpropagating waves, each one satisfying such an equation. One also recovers homologous equations when focusing on a given direction of propagation, and seeking unidirectional approximate solutions. This second justification is more restrictive as for the admissible initial data, but yields greater accuracy. Additionally, we present several new coupled asymptotic models: a Green-Naghdi type model, its simplified version in the so-called Camassa-Holm regime, and a weakly decoupled model. All of the models are rigorously justified in the sense of consistency.
