For the critical focusing wave equation \Box u = u^5 on \R^{3+1} in the radial case, we establish the role of the "center stable" manifold \Sigma constructed in \cite{KS} near the ground state (W,0) as a threshold between type I blowup and scattering to zero, establishing a conjecture going back to numerical work by Bizo\'n, Chmaj, Tabor. The underlying topology is stronger than the energy norm.
