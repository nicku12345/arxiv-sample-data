We consider a class of degenerate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators in \mathbb{R}^{N}, of the kind [\mathcal{A}\equiv\sum_{i,j=1}^{p_{0}}a_{ij}(x) \partial_{x_{i}x_{j}}^{2}+\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}b_{ij}x_{i}\partial_{x_{j}}%] where (a_{ij}) is symmetric uniformly positive definite on \mathbb{R}^{p_{0}} (p_{0}\leq N), with uniformly continuous and bounded entries, and (b_{ij}) is a constant matrix such that the frozen operator \mathcal{A}_{x_{0}} corresponding to a_{ij}(x_{0}) is hypoelliptic. For this class of operators we prove global L^{p} estimates (1<p<\infty) of the kind:% [|\partial_{x_{i}x_{j}}^{2}u|_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}% ^{N})}\leq c{|\mathcal{A}u|_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})}+|u|_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}% ^{N})}} for i,j=1,2,...,p_{0}.] We obtain the previous estimates as a byproduct of the following one, which is of interest in its own:% [|\partial_{x_{i}x_{j}}^{2}u|_{L^{p}(S_{T})}\leq c{|Lu|_{L^{p}(S_{T})}+|u|_{L^{p}(S_{T})}}] for any u\in C_{0}^{\infty}(S_{T}), where S_{T} is the strip \mathbb{R}^{N}\times[-T,T], T small, and L is the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck operator% [L\equiv\sum_{i,j=1}^{p_{0}}a_{ij}(x,t) \partial_{x_{i}x_{j}}% ^{2}+\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}b_{ij}x_{i}\partial_{x_{j}}-\partial_{t}%] with uniformly continuous and bounded a_{ij}'s.
