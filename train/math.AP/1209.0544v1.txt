Let n\geq 3, \alpha, \beta\in\mathbb{R}, and let v be a solution \Delta v+\alpha e^v+\beta x\cdot\nabla e^v=0 in \mathbb{R}^n, which satisfies the conditions \lim_{R\to\infty}\frac{1}{\log R}\int_{1}^{R}\rho^{1-n} (\int_{B_{\rho}}e^v\,dx)d\rho\in (0,\infty) and |x|^2e^{v(x)}\le A_1 in \R^n. We prove that \frac{v(x)}{\log |x|}\to -2 as |x|\to\infty and \alpha>2\beta. As a consequence under a mild condition on v we prove that the solution is radially symmetric about the origin.
