We study existence and regularity properties of solutions to the singular p-Laplacean parabolic system in a bounded domain \Omega. The main purpose is to prove global L^r(\varepsilon,T;L^q(\Omega)), \varepsilon\geq0, integrability properties of the second spatial derivatives and of the time derivative of the solutions. Hence, for suitable p and exponents r,\,q, by Sobolev embedding theorems, we deduce global regularity of u and \nabla u in H\"older spaces. Finally we prove a global pointwise bound for the solution under the assumption p>\frac{2n}{n+2}.
