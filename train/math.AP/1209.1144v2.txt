In \cite{LWZ}, we establish Liouville-type theorems and decay estimates for solutions of a class of high order elliptic equations and systems without the boundedness assumptions on the solutions. In this paper, we continue our work in \cite{LWZ} to investigate the role of boundedness assumption in proving Liouville-type theorems for fully nonlinear equations. We remove the boundedness assumption of solutions which was required in the proof of Liouville-type theorems for fully nonlinear elliptic equations or systems in half spaces. We also prove the Liouville-type theorems for supersolutions of a system of fully nonlinear equations with Pucci extremal operators in half spaces.
