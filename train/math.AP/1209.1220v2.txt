We study mapping properties of the averaging operator related to the variety  V={x\in \mathbb F_q^d: Q(x)=0}, where Q(x) is a nondegenerate quadratic polynomial over a finite field \mathbb F_q with q elements. This paper is devoted to eliminating the logarithmic bound appearing in the paper of Koh and Shen. As a consequence, we settle down the averaging problems over the quadratic surfaces V in the case when the dimensions d\geq 4 are even and V contains a d/2-dimensional subspace.
