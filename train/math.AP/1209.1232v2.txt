We study the existence and nonexistence of positive singular solutions to second-order non-divergence type elliptic inequalities with measurable coefficients. We prove the existence of a critical value p^* that separates the existence region from non-existence. In the critical case p=p^* we show that the existence of a singular solution depends on the rate at which the coefficients stabilize at zero and we provide some optimal conditions in this setting.
