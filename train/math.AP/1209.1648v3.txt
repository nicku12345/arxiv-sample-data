We study a certain class of weak solutions to rate-independent systems, which is constructed by using the local minimality in a small neighborhood of order \varepsilon and then taking the limit \varepsilon \to 0. We show that the resulting solution satisfies both the weak local stability and the new energy-dissipation balance, similarly to the BV solutions constructed by vanishing viscosity introduced recently by Mielke, Rossi and Savar\'e.
