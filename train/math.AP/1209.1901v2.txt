We study a class of systems of quasilinear differential inequalities associated to weakly coercive differential operators and power reaction terms. The main model cases are given by the p-Laplacian operator as well as the mean curvature operator in non parametric form. We prove that if the exponents lie under a certain curve, then the system has only the trivial solution. These results hold without any restriction provided the possible solutions are more regular. The underlying framework is the classical Euclidean case as well as the Carnot groups setting.
