In this paper, we establish global W^{2,p} estimates for solutions to the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations under natural assumptions on the domain, Monge-Amp\`ere measures and boundary data. Our estimates are affine invariant analogues of the global W^{2,p} estimates of Winter for fully nonlinear, uniformly elliptic equations, and also linearized counterparts of Savin's global W^{2,p} estimates for the Monge-Amp\`ere equations.
