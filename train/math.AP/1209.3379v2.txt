We show the existence of a self-similar solution for a modified Boltzmann equation describing probabilistic ballistic annihilation. Such a model describes a system of hard-spheres such that, whenever two particles meet, they either annihilate with probability \alpha \in (0,1) or they undergo an elastic collision with probability 1 - \alpha. For such a model, the number of particles, the linear momentum and the kinetic energy are not conserved. We show that, for \alpha smaller than some explicit threshold value  \alpha_*, a self-similar solution exists.
