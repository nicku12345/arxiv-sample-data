We consider the radial free wave equation in all dimensions and derive asymptotic formulas for the space partition of the energy relative to a light cone, as time goes to infinity. We show that the exterior energy estimate, which Duyckaerts, Merle and the second author obtained in odd dimensions, fails in even dimensions. Positive results for restricted classes of data are obtained. This is a companion paper to our two nonlinear papers with Andrew Lawrie.
