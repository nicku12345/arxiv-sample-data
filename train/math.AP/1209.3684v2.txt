We consider 1-equivariant wave maps from 1+2 dimensions to the 2-sphere of finite energy. We establish a classification of all degree 1 global solutions whose energies are less than three times the energy of the harmonic map Q. In particular, for each global energy solution of topological degree 1, we show that the solution asymptotically decouples into a rescaled harmonic map plus a radiation term. Together with our companion article, where we consider the case of finite-time blow up, this gives a characterization of all 1-equivariant, degree 1 wave maps in the energy regime [E(Q), 3E(Q)).
