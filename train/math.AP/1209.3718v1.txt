We prove several Liouville type results for stationary solutions of the d-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we show that when the dimension d \geqslant 4, the natural requirements \rho \in L^{\infty} (\mathbbm{R}^d), v \in \dot{H}^1 (\mathbbm{R}^d) suffice to guarantee that the solution is trivial. For dimensions d=2,3, we assume the extra condition v \in L^{\frac{3d}{d-1}}(\mathbb R^d). This improves a recent result of Chae (2012).
