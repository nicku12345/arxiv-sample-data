In this paper, we give a rigorous derivation of Einstein's geodesic hypothesis in general relativity. We use scaling stable solitons for nonlinear wave equations to approximate the test particle. Given a vacuum spacetime ([0, T]\times\mathbb{R}^3, h), we consider the scalar field coupled Einstein equations. For all sufficiently small \epsilon and \delta\leq \epsilon^q, q>1, where \delta, \epsilon are the amplitude and size of the particle, we show the existence of solution ([0, T]\times\mathbb{R}^3, g, \phi^\epsilon) to the coupled Einstein equations with the property that the energy of the particle \phi^\epsilon is concentrated along a timelike geodesic. Moreover, the gravitational field produced by \phi^\epsilon is negligibly small in C^1, that is, the spacetime metric g is C^1 close to h. These results generalize those obtained by D. Stuart.
