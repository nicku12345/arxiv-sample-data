We analyze a one dimensional version of a model of morphogen transport, a biological process governing cell differentiation. The model was proposed by Hufnagel et al. to describe the forming of morphogen gradient in the wing imaginal disc of the fruit fly. In mathematical terms the model is a system of reaction-diffusion equations which consists of two parabolic PDE's and three ODE's. The source of ligands is modelled by a Dirac Delta. Using semigroup approach and L_1 techniques we prove that the system is well-posed and possesses a unique steady state. All results are proved without imposing any artificial restrictions on the range of parameters.
