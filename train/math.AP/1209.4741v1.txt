We give a simplified presentation of the obstacle problem approach to stochastic homogenization for elliptic equations in nondivergence form. Our argument also applies to equations which depend on the gradient of the unknown function. In the latter case, we overcome difficulties caused by a lack of estimates for the first derivatives of approximate correctors by modifying the perturbed test function argument to take advantage of the spreading of the contact set.
