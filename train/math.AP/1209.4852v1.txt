In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to an elliptic equation near the singularity of an inverse square potential with a coefficient related to the best constant for the Hardy inequality. Due to the presence of a borderline Hardy potential, a proper variational setting has to be introduced in order to provide a weak formulation of the equation. An Almgren-type monotonicity formula is used to determine the exact asymptotic behavior of solutions.
