We investigate the boundedness and large time behavior of solutions of the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for the one-dimensional degenerate parabolic equation with gradient nonlinearity:  u_t = (|u-x|^{p-2} u-x)_x+|u_x|^q \qquad \text{in}\quad (0, +\infty)\tiles(0, 1),\qquad q > p > 2.   We prove that: either u_x blows up in finite time, or u is global and converges in W^{1, \infty}norm to the unique steady state. This in particular eliminates the possibility of global solutions with unbounded gradient. For that purpose a Lyapunov functional is constructed by the approach of Zelenyak.
