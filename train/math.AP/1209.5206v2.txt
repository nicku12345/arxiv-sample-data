In this paper we consider the supercritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation \partial_t\psi + \partial_{xxx}\psi + \partial_x(|\psi|^{p-1}\psi) = 0, where 5\leq p\in\R. We prove a local well-posedness result in the homogeneous Besov space \dot B^{s_p,2}_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}), where s_p=\frac12-\frac{2}{p-1} is the scaling critical index. In particular local well-posedness in the smaller inhomogeneous Sobolev space H^{s_p}(\mathbb{R}) can be proved similarly. As a byproduct a global well-posedness result for small initial data is also obtained.
