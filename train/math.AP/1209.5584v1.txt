We prove the local in time existence of the classical solutions to the system of equations of isothermal viscoelasticity with clamped boundary conditions. We deal with a general form of viscous stress tensor \mathcal{Z}(F,\dot F), assuming a Korn-type condition on its derivative D_{\dot F}\mathcal{Z}(F, \dot F). This condition is compatible with the balance of angular momentum, frame invariance and the Claussius-Duhem inequality. We give examples of linear and nonlinear (in \dot F) tensors \mathcal{Z} satisfying these required conditions.
