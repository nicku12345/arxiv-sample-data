We consider a monostable time-delayed reaction-diffusion equation arising from population dynamics models. We let a small parameter tend to zero and investigate the behavior of the solutions. We construct accurate lower barriers --- by using a non standard bistable approximation of the monostable problem--- and upper barriers. As a consequence, we prove the convergence to a propagating interface.
