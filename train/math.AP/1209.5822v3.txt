We prove quantitative unique continuation results for solutions of -\Delta u + W\cdot \nabla u + Vu = \lambda u, where \lambda \in \mathbb{C} and V and W are complex-valued decaying potentials that satisfy |V(x)| \lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-N} and |W(x)| \lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-P}. For M(R) = \inf_{|x_0| = R}||u||_{L^2(B_1(x_0))}, we show that if the solution u is non-zero, bounded, and u(0) = 1, then M(R) \gtrsim \exp(-C R^{\beta_0}(\log R)^{A( R)}), where \beta_0 = \max\{2 - 2P, \frac{4-2N}{3}, 1\}. Under certain conditions on N, P and \lambda, we construct examples (some of which are in the style of Meshkov) to prove that this estimate for M(R) is sharp. That is, we construct functions u, V and W such that -\Delta u + W\cdot \nabla u + Vu = \lambda u, |V(x)| \lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-N}, |W(x)| \lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-P} and |u(x)| \lesssim \exp(-c|x|^{\beta_0}(\log |x|)^C).
