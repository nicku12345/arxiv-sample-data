Let \Omega be a smooth, convex, unbounded domain of \R^N. Denote by \mu_1(\Omega) the first nontrivial Neumann eigenvalue of the Hermite operator in \Omega; we prove that \mu_1(\Omega) \ge 1. The result is sharp since equality sign is achieved when \Omega is a N-dimensional strip. Our estimate can be equivalently viewed as an optimal Poincar\'e-Wirtinger inequality for functions belonging to the weighted Sobolev space H^1(\Omega,d\gamma_N), where \gamma_N is the N-dimensional Gaussian measure.
