We consider functions u\in L^\infty(L^2)\cap L^p(W^{1,p}) with 1<p<\infty on a time space domain. Solutions to non-linear evolutionary PDE's typically belong to these spaces. Many applications require a Lipschitz approximation u_\lambda of u which coincides with u on a large set. For problems arising in fluid mechanics one needs to work with solenoidal (divergence-free) functions. Thus, we construct a Lipschitz approximation, which is also solenoidal. As an application we revise the existence proof for non-stationary generalized Newtonian fluids in [DRW10]. Since {\rm div} u_\lambda=0, we are able to work in the pressure free formulation, which heavily simplifies the proof. We also provide a simplified approach to the stationary solenoidal Lipschitz truncation of [BDF12].
