Let V be a nonnegative locally bounded function defined in Q_\infty:=\BBR^n\times(0,\infty). We study under what conditions on V and on a Radon measure \gm in \mathbb{R}^d does it exist a function which satisfies \partial_t u-\xD u+ Vu=0 in Q_\infty and u(.,0)=\xm. We prove the existence of a subcritical case in which any measure is admissible and a supercritical case where capacitary conditions are needed. We obtain a general representation theorem of positive solutions when t V(x,t) is bounded and we prove the existence of an initial trace in the class of outer regular Borel measures.
