We perform a detailed analysis of first order Sobolev-regular infinitesimal isometries on developable surfaces without affine regions. We prove that given enough regularity of the surface, any first order infinitesimal isometry can be matched to an infinitesimal isometry of an arbitrarily high order. We discuss the implications of this result for the elasticity of thin developable shells.
