In this article, we study the critical dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation (SQG) in  \mathbb{R}^2. Motivated by the study of the homogeneous statistical solutions of this equation, we show that for any large initial data \theta_{0} liying in the space \Lambda^{s} (\dot H^{s}_{uloc}(\mathbb{R}^2)) \cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2) the critical (SQG) has a global weak solution in time for all 1/2< s<1. Our proof is based on an energy inequality verified by the truncated (SQG)_{R,\ep} equation. By classical compactness arguments, we show that we are able to pass to the limit (R \rightarrow \infty, \ep \rightarrow 0) in (SQG)_{R,\ep} and that the limit solution has the desired regularity.
