We investigate the confinement properties of solutions of the aggregation equation with repulsive-attractive potentials. We show that solutions remain compactly supported in a large fixed ball depending on the initial data and the potential. The arguments apply to the functional setting of probability measures with mildly singular repulsive-attractive potentials and to the functional setting of smooth solutions with a potential being the sum of the Newtonian repulsion at the origin and a smooth suitably growing at infinity attractive potential.
