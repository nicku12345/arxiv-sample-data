We prove a weak comparison principle in narrow unbounded domains for solutions to -\Delta_p u=f(u) in the case 2<p< 3 and f(\cdot) is a power-type nonlinearity, or in the case p>2 and f(\cdot) is super-linear.   We exploit it to prove the monotonicity of positive solutions to -\Delta_p u=f(u) in half spaces (with zero Dirichlet assumption) and therefore to prove some Liouville-type theorems.
