This paper is concerned with optimal time-decay estimates of solutions of the Cauchy problem to a model system of the radiating gas in \mathbb{R}^n. Compared to Liu and Kawashima (2011) \cite{Liu1} and Wang and Wang (2009) \cite{Wang}, without smallness assumption of initial perturbation in L^1-norm, we study large time behavior of small amplitude classical solutions to the Cauchy problem. The optimal H^N-norm time-decay rates of the solutions in \mathbb{R}^n with 1\leq n\leq4 are obtained by applying the Fourier splitting method introduced in Schonbek (1980) \cite{Schonbek1} with a slight modification and an energy method. Furthermore, basing on a refined pure energy method introduced in Guo and Wang \cite{Guo} (2011), we give optimal L^p-L^2(\mathbb{R}^3) decay estimates of the derivatives of solutions when initial perturbation is bounded in L^p-norm with some p\in(1,2].
