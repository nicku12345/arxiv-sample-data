For semi-linear wave equations with null form non-linearities on \mathbb{R}^{3+1}, we exhibit an open set of initial data which are allowed to be large in energy spaces, yet we can still obtain global solutions in the future.   We also exhibit a set of localized data for which the corresponding solutions are strongly focused, which in geometric terms means that a wave travels along an specific incoming null geodesic in such a way that almost all of the energy is confined in a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic and almost no energy radiating out of this tubular neighborhood.
