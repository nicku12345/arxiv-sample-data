Given (M,g) a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n\geq 3, we are interested in the existence of blowing-up sign-changing families (\ue)_{\eps>0}\in C^{2,\theta}(M), \theta\in (0,1), of solutions to \Delta_g \ue+h\ue=|\ue|^{\frac{4}{n-2}-\eps}\ue\hbox{ in }M\,, where \Delta_g:=-\hbox{div}_g(\nabla) and h\in C^{0,\theta}(M) is a potential. We prove that such families exist in two main cases: in small dimension n\in \{3,4,5,6\} for any potential h or in dimension 3\leq n\leq 9 when h\equiv\frac{n-2}{4(n-1)}\Scal_g. These examples yield a complete panorama of the compactness/noncompactness of critical elliptic equations of scalar curvature type on compact manifolds. The changing of the sign is necessary due to the compactness results of Druet and Khuri--Marques--Schoen.
