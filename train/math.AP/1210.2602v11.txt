In this paper we first obtain local contraction results in a Hm-norm with respect to time and space for a local scheme. We show that a global controlled scheme preserves higher order regularity with respect to the spatial variables together with polynomial decay of order m of the data at each time step. Here, we simplify the controlled scheme considered in [1] and [2]. Especially, for the simplified controlled scheme we get an upper bound for the Leray projection term. Furthermore, the schemes discussed in [1] and [2] are simplified in the sense that the estimates are achieved without the use of some properties concerning the adjoint of a local fundamental solutions with variable drift terms. We note that the pointwise and absolute convergence of the local functional series and their first order time derivatives and their spatial derivatives leads to a constructive approach of local and global classical solutions.
