In this paper we study compactness and quantization properties of sequences of 1/2-harmonic maps u_k\colon\R\to {\cal{S}}^{m-1} such that |u_k|_{\dot H^{1/2}(\R,{\cal{S}}^{m-1})}\le C. More precisely we show that there exist a weak 1/2-harmonic map u_\infty\colon\R\to {\cal{S}}^{m-1}, a possible empty set {a_1,...,a_\ell} in \R such that up to subsequences (|(-\Delta)^{1/4}u_k|^2 \rightharpoonup |(-\Delta)^{1/4}u_{\infty}|^2)dx+\sum_{i=1}^{\ell}\lambda_i \delta_{a_i}, in Radon measure, as k\to +\infty, with \lambda_i\ge 0.   The convergence of u_k to u_\infty is strong in \dot W^{1/2,p}_{loc}(\R\setminus{a_1,...,a_\ell}), for every p\ge 1. We quantify the loss of energy in the weak convergence and we show that in the case of non-constant 1/2-harmonic maps with values in  {\cal{S}}^2\, one has \lambda_i=2 \pi n_i, with n_i a positive integer.
