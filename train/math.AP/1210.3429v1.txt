In this paper, we study global well-posedness of the two-dimensional Keller-Segel model in Lebesgue space and Sobolev space. Recall that in the paper "Existence and uniqueness theorem on mild solutions to the Keller-Segel system in the scaling invariant space, J. Differential Equations, {252}(2012), 1213--1228", Kozono, Sugiyama & Wachi studied global well-posedness of n(\ge3) dimensional Keller-Segel system and posted a question about the even local in time existence for the Keller-Segel system with L^1(R^2)\times{L}^\infty(R^2) initial data. Here we give an affirmative answer to this question: in fact, we show the global in time existence and uniqueness for L^1(R^2)\times{L}^{\infty}(R^2) initial data. Furthermore, we prove that for any H^1_b(R^2) \times {H}^1(R^2) initial data with H^1_b(R^2):=H^1(R^2)\cap{L}^\infty(R^2), there also exists a unique global mild solution to the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel model. The estimates of {\sup_{t>0}}t^{1-\frac{n}{p}}\|u\|_{L^p} for (n,p)=(2,\infty) and the introduced special half norm, i.e. \sup_{t>0}t^{1/2}(1+t)^{-1/2}\|\nabla{v}\|_{L^\infty}, are crucial in our proof.
