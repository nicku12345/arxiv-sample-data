In the previous paper \cite{J1}, we established pointwise bounds for the Green function of the linearized equation associated with spatially periodic traveling waves \bar u of a system of reaction diffusion equations, and also obtained pointwise nonlinear stability and behavior of \bar u under small perturbations. In this paper, using periodic resolvent kernels and the Bloch-decomposition, we establish pointwise bounds for the Green function of the linearized equation associated with periodic standing waves \bar u of a system of conservation laws. We also show pointwise nonlinear stability of \bar u by estimating decay of modulated perturbation v of \bar u under small perturbation |v_0| \leq E_0(1+|x|)^{-3/2} for sufficiently small E_0>0.
