We consider spherically symmetric motions of inviscid compressible gas surrounding a solid ball under the gravity of the core. Equilibria touch the vacuum with finite radii, and the linearized equation around one of the equilibria has time-periodic solutions. To justify the linearization, we should construct true solutions for which this time-periodic solution plus the equilibrium is the first approximation. But this leads us to difficulty caused by singularities at the free boundary touching the vacuum. We solve this problem by the Nash-Moser theorem.
