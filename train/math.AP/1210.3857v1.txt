Several regularity criterions of Leray-Hopf weak solutions u to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. The results show that a weak solution u becomes regular if the gradient of velocity component \nabla_{h}{u} (or  \nabla{u_3}) satisfies the additional conditions in the class of L^{q}(0,T; \dot{B}_{p,r}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{3})), where \nabla_{h}=(\partial_{x_{1}},\partial_{x_{2}}) is the horizontal gradient operator. Besides, we also consider the anisotropic regularity criterion for the weak solution of Navier-Stokes equations in \mathbb{R}^3. Finally, we also get a further regularity criterion, when give the sufficient condition on \partial_3u_3.
