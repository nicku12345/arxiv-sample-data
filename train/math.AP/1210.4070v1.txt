This paper is concerned with the rigorous analysis of the zero electron mass limit of the full Navier-Stokes-Poisson. This system has been introduced in the literature by Anile and Pennisi (see [5]) in order to describe a hydrodynamic model for charge-carrier transport in semiconductor devices. The purpose of this paper is to prove rigorously zero electron mass limit in the framework of general ill prepared initial data. In this situation the velocity field and the electronic fields develop fast oscillations in time. The main idea we will use in this paper is a combination of formal asymptotic expansion and rigorous uniform estimates on the error terms. Finally we prove the strong convergence of the full Navier Stokes Poisson system towards the incompressible Navier Stokes equations.
