Let \Gamma denote a smooth simple curve in \mathbb{R}^{N}, N\geq2, possibly with boundary. Let \Omega_{R} be the open normal tubular neighborhood of radius 1 of the expanded curve R\Gamma:=\{Rx\mid x\in \Gamma\smallsetminus\partial\Gamma\}. Consider the superlinear problem -\Delta u+\lambda u=f(u) on the domains \Omega_{R}, as R\rightarrow \infty, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. We prove the existence of multibump solutions with bumps lined up along R\Gamma with alternating signs. The function f is superlinear at 0 and at \infty, but it is not assumed to be odd.   If the boundary of the curve is nonempty our results give examples of contractible domains in which the problem has multiple sign changing solutions.
