We study the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation associated with the sublaplacian L on the unit sphere S^{2n+1} in C^{n+1} equipped with its natural CR structure. We first prove Strichartz estimates with fractional loss of derivatives for the solutions of the free Schr\"odinger equation and we then deduce some local in time well-posedness results. Our results are stated in terms of certain Sobolev-type spaces, that measure the regularity of functions on S^2n+1 differently according to their spectral localization. Stronger conclusions are obtained for particular classes of solutions, corresponding to initial data whose spectrum is contained in a proper cone of N^2.
