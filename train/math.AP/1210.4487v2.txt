We consider the monomial weight |x_1|^{A_1}...|x_n|^{A_n} in \mathbb R^n, where A_i\geq0 is a real number for each i=1,...,n, and establish Sobolev, isoperimetric, Morrey, and Trudinger inequalities involving this weight. They are the analogue of the classical ones with the Lebesgue measure dx replaced by |x_1|^{A_1}...|x_n|^{A_n}dx, and they contain the best or critical exponent (which depends on A_1, ..., A_n). More importantly, for the Sobolev and isoperimetric inequalities, we obtain the best constant and extremal functions.   When A_i are nonnegative \textit{integers}, these inequalities are exactly the classical ones in the Euclidean space \mathbb R^D (with no weight) when written for axially symmetric functions and domains in \mathbb R^D=\mathbb R^{A_1+1}\times...\times\mathbb R^{A_n+1}.
