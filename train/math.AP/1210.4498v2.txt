In this paper we analyze a method of to approximation for the weak solutions of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD) in unbounded domains. In particular we describe an hyperbolic version of the so called artificial compressibility method adapted to the MHD system. By exploiting the wave equation structure of the approximating system we achieve the convergence of the approximating sequences by means of dispersive estimate of Strichartz type. We prove that the soleinoidal component of the approximating velocity and magnetic fields is relatively compact and converges strongly to a weak solution of the MHD equation.
