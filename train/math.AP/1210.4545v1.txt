The convergence of Ces\`{a}ro means of negative order of double trigonometric Fourier series of functions of bounded partial \Lambda-variation is investigated. The sufficient and neccessary conditions on the sequence \Lambda =\{\lambda_{n}\} are found for the convergence of Ces\`{a}ro means of Fourier series of functions of bounded partial \Lambda-variation.
