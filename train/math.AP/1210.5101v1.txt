In this paper, we study the relationship between a diffusive model and a non-diffusive model which are both derived from the well-known Keller-Segel model, as a coefficient of diffusion \varepsilon goes to zero. First, we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem for the diffusive model with smooth initial data which is of small L^2 norm, together with some {\it a priori} estimates uniform for t and \varepsilon. Then we investigate the zero-diffusion limit, and get the global well-posedness of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem for the non-diffusive model. Finally, we derive the convergence rate of the diffusive model toward the non-diffusive model. It is shown that the convergence rate in L^\infty norm is of the order O(\varepsilon^{1/2}). It should be noted that the initial data is small in L^2-norm but can be of large oscillations with constant state at far field. As a byproduct, we improve the corresponding result on the well-posedness of the non-difussive model which requires small oscillations.
