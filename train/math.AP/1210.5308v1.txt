In this paper, we investigate nonlinear Schr\ddot{o}dinger type equations in R^N under the framework of variable exponent spaces. We propose new assumptions on the nonlinear term to yield bounded Palais-Smale sequences and then prove the special sequences we find converge to critical points respectively. The main arguments are based on the geometry supplied by Fountain Theorem. Consequently, we show that the equation has a sequence of solutions with high energies.
