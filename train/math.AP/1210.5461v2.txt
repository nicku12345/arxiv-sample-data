We derive, via simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction, the Gamma-limit for thin elastic plates whose energy density oscillates on a scale that is either comparable to, or much smaller than, the film thickness. We consider the energy scaling that corresponds to Kirchhoff's nonlinear bending theory of plates.
