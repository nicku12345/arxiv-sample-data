We study the boundary regularity of solutions to divergence form operators which are small perturbations of operators for which the boundary regularity of solutions is known. An operator is a small perturbation of another operator if the deviation function of the coefficients satisfies a Carleson measure condition with small norm. We extend Escauriaza's result on Lipschitz domains to chord arc domains with small constant. In particular we prove that if L_1 is a small perturbation of L_0 and \log k_0 has small BMO norm so does \log k_1. Here k_i denotes the density of the elliptic measure of L_i with respect to the surface measure of the boundary of the domain.
