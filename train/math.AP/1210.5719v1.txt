We consider the sinh-Poisson equation (P)_\lambda\quad -\Delta u=\la\sinh u\ \hbox{in}\ \Omega,\ u=0\ \hbox{on}\ \partial\Omega, where \Omega is a smooth bounded domain in \rr^2 and \lambda is a small positive parameter.   If 0\in\Omega and \Omega is symmetric with respect to the origin, for any integer k if \la is small enough, we construct a family of solutions to (P)_\la which blows-up at the origin whose positive mass is 4\pi k(k-1) and negative mass is 4\pi k(k+1).   It gives a complete answer to an open problem formulated by Jost-Wang-Ye-Zhou in [Calc. Var. PDE (2008) 31: 263-276].
