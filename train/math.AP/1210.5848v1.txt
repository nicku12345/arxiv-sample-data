We prove a sharp upper bound for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of a class of nonlinear elliptic operators which includes the p-Laplace and the pseudo-p-Laplace operators. Moreover, we prove a stability result by means of a suitable isoperimetric deficity. Finally, we give a sharp lower bound for the anisotropic p-torsional rigidity.
