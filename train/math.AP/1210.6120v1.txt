There are few approaches to the solution of a system of nonlinear differential equations in partial derivatives, for example \cite{NK87} - \cite{EK98}. In our paper we propose an approach that was used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensional space. This solution is described in details in article "Existence, uniqueness and smoothness of solution for 3D Navier-Stokes equations with any smooth initial velocity" \cite{TT12}. The authors expect that it can be successfully applied to other systems of nonlinear differential equations in partial derivatives.
