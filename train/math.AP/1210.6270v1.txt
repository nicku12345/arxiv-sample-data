We study the existence of solutions with multiple concentration to the following boundary value problem -\Delta u=\e^2 e^u-4\pi \sum_{p\in Z}\alpha_p \delta_{p}\;\hbox{in} \Omega,\quad u=0 \;\hbox{on}\partial \Omega, where \Omega is a smooth and bounded domain in \R^2, \alpha_{p}'s are positive numbers, Z\subset \Omega is a finite set, \delta_p defines the Dirac mass at p, and \e>0 is a small parameter. In particular we extend the result of Del-Pino-Kowalczyk-Musso (\cite{delkomu}) to the case of several singular sources. More precisely we prove that, under suitable restrictions on the weights \alpha_p, a solution exists with a number of blow-up points \xi_j\in \Omega\setminus Z up to \sum_{p\in Z}\max\{n\in\N\,|\, n<1+\alpha_p\}.
