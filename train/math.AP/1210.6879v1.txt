We address the decay rates of the energy for the damped wave equation when the damping coefficient b does not satisfy the Geometric Control Condition (GCC). First, we give a link with the controllability of the associated Schr\"odinger equation. We prove in an abstract setting that the observability of the Schr\"odinger group implies that the semigroup associated to the damped wave equation decays at rate 1/\sqrt{t} (which is a stronger rate than the general logarithmic one predicted by the Lebeau Theorem).   Second, we focus on the 2-dimensional torus. We prove that the best decay one can expect is 1/t, as soon as the damping region does not satisfy GCC. Conversely, for smooth damping coefficients b, we show that the semigroup decays at rate 1/t^{1-\eps}, for all \eps >0. The proof relies on a second microlocalization around trapped directions, and resolvent estimates.   In the case where the damping coefficient is a characteristic function of a strip (hence discontinuous), St\'{e}phane Nonnenmacher computes in an appendix part of the spectrum of the associated damped wave operator, proving that the semigroup cannot decay faster than 1/t^{2/3}. In particular, our study shows that the decay rate highly depends on the way b vanishes.
