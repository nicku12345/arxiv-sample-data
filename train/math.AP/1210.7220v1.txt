We introduce a new PDE approach to establishing the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, which modifies and simplifies the previous ones (Barles and Souganidis, 2000; Barles, Ishii and Mitake, 2012), under a refined "strict convexity" assumption on the Hamiltonians. Not only such "strict convexity" conditions generalize the corresponding requirements on the Hamiltonians in Barles and Souganidis (2000), but also one of the most refined our conditions covers the situation studied in Namah and Roquejoffre (1999).
