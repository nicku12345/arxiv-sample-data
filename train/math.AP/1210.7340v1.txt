For a family of second-order elliptic systems of Maxwell's type with rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients in a C^{1, \alpha} domain \Omega, we establish uniform estimates of solutions u_\varep and \nabla \times u_\varep in L^p(\Omega) for 1<p\le \infty. The proof relies on the uniform W^{1,p} and Lipschitz estimates for solutions of scalar elliptic equations with periodic coefficients.
