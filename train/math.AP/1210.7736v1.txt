We prove resolvent estimates for nontrapping manifolds with cusps which imply the existence of arbitrarily wide resonance free strips, local smoothing for the Schrodinger equation, and resonant wave expansions. We obtain lossless limiting absorption and local smoothing estimates, but the estimates on the holomorphically continued resolvent exhibit losses. We prove that these estimates are optimal in certain respects.
