In conformal geometry, the Compactness Conjecture asserts that the set of Yamabe metrics on a smooth, compact, aspherical Riemannian manifold (M,g) is compact. Established in the locally conformally flat case by Schoen [43,44] and for n\leq 24 by Khuri-Marques-Schoen [26], it has revealed to be generally false for n\geq 25 as shown by Brendle [8] and Brendle-Marques [9]. A stronger version of it, the compactness under perturbations of the Yamabe equation, is addressed here with respect to the linear geometric potential n-2/4(n-1) Scal_g, Scal_g being the Scalar curvature of (M,g). We show that a-priori L^\infty-bounds fail for linear perturbations on all manifolds with n\geq 4 as well as a-priori gradient L^2--bounds fail for non-locally conformally flat manifolds with n\geq 6 and for locally conformally flat manifolds with n\geq 7. In several situations, the results are optimal. Our proof combines a finite dimensional reduction and the construction of a suitable ansatz for the solutions generated by a family of varying metrics in the conformal class of g.
