This paper is concerned with the lifespan and the blowup mechanism for smooth solutions to the 2-D nonlinear wave equation \p_t^2u-\ds\sum_{i=1}^2\p_i(c_i^2(u)\p_iu) =0, where c_i(u)\in C^{\infty}(\Bbb R^n), c_i(0)\neq 0, and (c_1'(0))^2+(c_2'(0))^2\neq 0. This equation has an interesting physics background as it arises from the pressure-gradient model in compressible fluid dynamics and also in nonlinear variational wave equations. Under the initial condition (u(0,x), \p_tu(0,x))=(\ve u_0(x), \ve u_1(x)) with u_0(x), u_1(x)\in C_0^{\infty}(\Bbb R^2), and \ve>0 is small, we will show that the classical solution u(t,x) stops to be smooth at some finite time T_{\ve}. Moreover, blowup occurs due to the formation of a singularity of the first-order derivatives \na_{t,x}u(t,x), while u(t,x) itself is continuous up to the blowup time T_{\ve}.
