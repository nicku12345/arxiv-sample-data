We consider the following nonlinear Schrodinger equation [{l} \Delta u-(1+\delta V)u+f(u)=0 in \R^N, u>0 in \R^N, u\in H^1(\R^N).] where V is a potential satisfying some decay condition and  f(u) is a superlinear nonlinearity satisfying some nondegeneracy condition. Using localized energy method, we prove that there exists some \delta_0 such that for 0<\delta<\delta_0, the above problem has infinitely many positive solutions. This generalizes and gives a new proof of the results by Cerami-Passaseo-Solimini (CPAM to appear). The new techniques allow us to establish the existence of infinitely many positive bound states for elliptic systems.
