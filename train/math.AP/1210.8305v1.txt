This paper is devoted to the investigation of the boundary regularity for the Poisson equation {{cc} -\Delta u = f & \text{in} \Omega u= 0 & \text{on} \partial \Omega where f belongs to some L^p(\Omega) and \Omega is a Reifenberg-flat domain of \mathbb R^n. More precisely, we prove that given an exponent \alpha\in (0,1), there exists an \varepsilon>0 such that the solution u to the previous system is locally H\"older continuous provided that \Omega is (\varepsilon,r_0)-Reifenberg-flat. The proof is based on Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman's monotonicity formula and Morrey-Campanato theorem.
