We study energy measures on SG based on harmonic functions. We characterize the positive energy measures through studying the bounds of Radon-Nikodym derivatives with respect to the Kusuoka measure. We prove a limited continuity of the derivative on the graph V_* and express the average value of the derivative on a whole cell as a weighted average of the values on the boundary vertices. We also prove some characterizations and properties of the weights.
