We study the symmetry properties for solutions of elliptic systems of the type {ll}-\dive(a_1(x,|\nabla u^1|(X))\nabla u^1(X))=F_{1}(x, u^1(X),..., u^n(X)), ... -\dive(a_n(x,|\nabla u^n|(X))\nabla u^n(X))=F_{n}(x, u^1(X),..., u^n(X)), where x\in \R^m with 1\leq m< N, X=(x,y)\in \R^m\times \R^{N-m}, and F_{1},..., F_{n} are the derivatives with respect to \xi^1,..., \xi^n of some F=F(x,\xi^1,..., \xi^n) such that for any i=1,..., n and any fixed (x,\xi^1,..., \xi^{i-1},\xi^{i+1},..., \xi^n)\in \R^m\times \R^{n-1} the map \xi^i\to F(x,\xi^1,...,\xi^i,..., \xi^n) belongs to C^2(\R). We obtain a Poincar\'e-type formula for the solutions of the system and we use it to prove a symmetry result both for stable and for monotone solutions.
