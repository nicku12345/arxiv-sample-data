In this paper, following Nachman's idea and Haberman and Tataru's idea, we reconstruct C^1 conductivity \gamma or Lipchitz conductivity \gamma with small enough value of |\nabla log\gamma| in a Lipschitz domain \Omega from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map \Lambda_{\gamma}. In the appendix the authors and R. M. Brown recover the gradient of a C^1-conductivity at the boundary of a Lipschitz domain from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map \Lambda_{\gamma}.
