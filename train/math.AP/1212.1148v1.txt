Let {\mathcal O} \subset {\mathbb R}^d be a bounded domain with the boundary of class C^{1,1}. In L_2({\mathcal O};{\mathbb C}^n), a matrix elliptic second order differential operator {\mathcal A}_{N,\varepsilon} with the Neumann boundary condition is considered. Here \varepsilon>0 is a small parameter, the coefficients of {\mathcal A}_{N,\varepsilon} are periodic and depend on {\mathbf x} /\varepsilon. There are no regularity assumptions on the coefficients. It is shown that the resolvent ({\mathcal A}_{N,\varepsilon}+\lambda I)^{-1} converges in the L_2({\mathcal O};{\mathbb C}^n)-operator norm to the resolvent of the effective operator {\mathcal A}_N^0 with constant coefficients, as \varepsilon \to 0. A sharp order error estimate |({\mathcal A}_{N,\varepsilon}+\lambda I)^{-1} - ({\mathcal A}_{N}^0 +\lambda I)^{-1}|_{L_2\to L_2} \le C\varepsilon is obtained. Approximation for the resolvent ({\mathcal A}_{N,\varepsilon}+\lambda I)^{-1} in the norm of operators acting from L_2({\mathcal O};{\mathbb C}^n) to the Sobolev space H^1({\mathcal O};{\mathbb C}^n) with an error O(\sqrt{\varepsilon}) is found. Approximation is given by the sum of the operator ({\mathcal A}^0_N +\lambda I)^{-1} and the first order corrector. In a strictly interior subdomain {\mathcal O}' a similar approximation with an error O(\varepsilon) is obtained.
