In this paper we prove local-in-time Strichartz estimates with loss of derivatives for Schr\"odinger equations with variable coefficients and potentials, under the conditions that the geodesic flow is nontrapping and potentials grow polynomially at infinity. This is a generalization to the case with variable coefficients and improvement of the result by Yajima-Zhang. The proof is based on microlocal techniques including the semiclassical parametrix for a time scale depending on a spatial localization and the Littlewood-Paley type decomposition with respect to both of space and frequency.
