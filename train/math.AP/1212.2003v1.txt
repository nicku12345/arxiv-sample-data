We first generalize a decomposition of functions on Carnot groups as linear combinations of the Dirac delta and some of its derivatives, where the weights are the moments of the function.   We then use the decomposition to describe the large time behavior of solutions of the hypoelliptic heat equation on Carnot groups. The solution is decomposed as a weighted sum of the hypoelliptic fundamental kernel and its derivatives, the coefficients being the moments of the initial datum.
