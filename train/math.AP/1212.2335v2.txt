Several types of new regularity criteria for Leray-Hopf weak solutions u to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. Some of them are based on the third component u_3 of velocity under Prodi-Serrin index condition, another type is in terms of \omega_3 and \partial_3u_3 with Prodi-Serrin index condition. And a very recent work of the authors, based on only one of the nine entries of the gradient tensor, is renovated.
