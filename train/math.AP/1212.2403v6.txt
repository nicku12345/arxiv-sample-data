We introduce a global scheme on the n-torus of a controlled incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in terms of a coupled controlled infinite ODE-system of Fourier-modes with smooth data. We construct a scheme of global approximations related to linear partial integrodifferential equations in dual space which are uniformly bounded in dual Sobolev spaces with polynomially decaying modes. The scheme is based on some infinite matrix algebra related to weakly singular integrals, and a Trotter-product formula for dissipative operators which leads to rigorous existence results and a uniform bound for the solutions of the successive approximating linearized equations in dual space which may be otherwise represented as formal solutions in the sense of an iterated Dyson formalism.
