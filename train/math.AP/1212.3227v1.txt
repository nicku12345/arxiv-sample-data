This paper aims at the global regularity problem concerning the 2D incompressible Boussinesq equations with general critical dissipation. The critical dissipation refers to \alpha +\beta=1 when \Lambda^\alpha \equiv (-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} and \Lambda^\beta represent the fractional Laplacian dissipation in the velocity and the temperature equations, respectively. We establish the global regularity for the general case with \alpha+\beta=1 and 0.9132\approx \alpha_0<\alpha<1. The cases when \alpha=1 and when \alpha=0 were previously resolved by Hmidi, Keraani and Rousset \cite{HKR1,HKR2}. The global existence and uniqueness is achieved here by exploiting the global regularity of a generalized critical surface quasi-gesotrophic equation as well as the regularity of a combined quantity of the vorticity and the temperature.
