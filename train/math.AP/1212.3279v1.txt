In this paper, we consider a drift-diffusion system describing the corrosion of an iron based alloy in a nuclear waste repository. In comparison with the classical drift-diffusion system arising in the modeling of semiconductor devices, the originality of the corrosion model lies in the boundary conditions which are of Robin type and induce an additional coupling between the equations. We prove the existence of a weak solution by passing to the limit on a sequence of approximate solutions given by a semi-discretization in time.
