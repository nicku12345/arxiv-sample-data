We construct the global solution to the Cauchy's problem of the bipolar Euler-Poisson equations with damping in \mathbb{R}^3 when H^3 norm of the initial data is small. If further, the \dot{H}^{-s} norm (0\leq s<3/2) or \dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{-s} norm (0<s\leq3/2) of the initial data is bounded, we give the optimal decay rates of the solution. As a byproduct, the decay results of the L^p-L^2 (1\leq p\leq2) type hold without the smallness of the L^p norm of the initial data. In particular, we deduce that \|\nabla^k(\rho_1-\rho_2)\|_{L^2} \sim(1+t)^{-5/4-\frac{k}{2}} and \|\nabla^k(\rho_i-\bar{\rho},u_i,\nabla\phi)\|_{L^2} \sim(1+t)^{-3/4-\frac{k}{2}}. We improve the decay results in Li and Yang \cite{Li3}(\emph{J.Differential Equations} 252(2012), 768-791), where they showed the decay rates as \|\nabla^k(\rho_i-\bar{\rho})\|_{L^2} \sim(1+t)^{-3/4-\frac{k}{2}} and \|\nabla^k(u_i,\nabla\phi)\|_{L^2} \sim(1+t)^{-1/4-\frac{k}{2}}, when the H^3\cap L^1 norm of the initial data is small. Our analysis is motivated by the technique developed recently in Guo and Wang \cite{Guo}(\emph{Comm. Partial Differential Equations} 37(2012), 2165-2208) with some modifications.
