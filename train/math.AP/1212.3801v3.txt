We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with a fractional power \alpha\in[1,\infty) of the Laplacian in the three dimensional case. We prove the existence of a smooth solution with arbitrarily small in \dot{B}_{\infty,p}^{-\alpha} (2<p \leq \infty) initial data that becomes arbitrarily large in \dot{B}_{\infty,\infty}^{-s} for all s> 0 in arbitrarily small time. This extends the result of Bourgain and Pavlovi\'{c} for the classical Navier-Stokes equation which utilizes the fact that the energy transfer to low modes increases norms with negative smoothness indexes. It is remarkable that the space \dot{B}_{\infty,\infty}^{-\alpha} is supercritical for \alpha >1. Moreover, the norm inflation occurs even in the case \alpha \geq 5/4 where the global regularity is known.
