We prove existence and stability results for a two-parameter family of solitary-wave solutions to a system in which an equation of nonlinear Schr\"odinger type is coupled to an equation of Korteweg-de Vries type. Such systems model interactions between short and long dispersive waves. The results extend earlier results of Angulo, Albert and Angulo, and Chen. Our proof involves the characterization of solitary-wave solutions as minimizers of an energy functional subject to two constraints. To establish the precompactness of minimizing sequences via concentrated compactness, we establish the sub-additivity of the problem with respect to both constraint variables jointly.
