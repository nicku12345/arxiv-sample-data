We prove boundary regularity and a compactness result for parabolic nonlocal equations of the form u_t-Iu=f, where the operator I is not necessarily translation invariant. As a consequence of this and the regularity results for translation invariant case, we obtain C^{1,\alpha} interior estimates in space for non translation invariant operators under some hypothesis on the time regularity of the boundary data.
