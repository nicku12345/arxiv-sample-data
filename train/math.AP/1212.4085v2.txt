We prove sharpness of quantitative unique continuation results for solutions of -\Delta u + W\cdot \nabla u + V u = \la u, where \la \in \C and V and W are complex-valued decaying potentials that satisfy |V(x)| \lesssim <x>^{-N} and |W(x)| \lesssim <x>^{-P}. For M(R) = \inf_{|x_0| = R}||u||_{L^2(B_1(x_0))}, it was shown in a companion paper that if the solution u is non-zero, bounded, and u(0) = 1, then M(R) \gtrsim \exp(-C R^{\be_0}(\log R)^{A(R)}), where \be_0 = max{2 - 2P, (4-2N)/3, 1}. Under certain conditions on N, P, \la, and the dimension, we construct examples (some of which are in the style of Meshkov) to prove that this estimate for M(R) is sharp. That is, we construct functions u, V and W such that -\Delta u + W\cdot \nabla u + V u = \la u, |V(x)| \lesssim <x>^{-N}, |W(x)| \lesssim <x>^{-P} and |u(x)| \lesssim \exp(-c|x|^{\be_0}(\log |x|)^C).
