We introduce a one parameter family of non-linear, non-local integro-differential equations and its limit equation. These equations originate from a derivation of the linear Boltzmann equation using the framework of bosonic quantum field theory. We show the existence and uniqueness of strong global solutions for these equations, and a result of uniform convergence on every compact interval of the solutions of the one parameter family towards the solution of the limit equation.
