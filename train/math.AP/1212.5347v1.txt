This is the first of a series of papers devoted to the initial value problem for the Euler system of compressible fluids and augmented versions containing higher-order terms. We encompass solutions that have finite total energy and enjoy a certain symmetry (for instance, plane symmetry); these solutions may have unbounded amplitude and contain cavitation regions in which the mass density vanishes. In the present paper, we are interested in dispersive shock waves and analyze the zero viscosity-capillarity limit associated with the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system. Specifically, we establish the existence of finite energy solutions as well as their convergence toward entropy solutions to the Euler system. We encompass a broad class of nonlinear Navier-Stokes-Korteweg constitutive laws, which is determined by two main conditions relating the viscosity and capillarity coefficients, that is, on one hand the strong coercivity condition (as we call it) which provides a favorable sign for the integrated dissipation associated with an effective energy, and on the other hand the tame capillarity condition (as we call it), which restricts pointwise the strength of the capillarity relatively to the viscosity. Rather mild conditions on the growth of the constitutive functions are aso imposed, which are required in order to define finite energy weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system, even in the presence of cavitation. Our method of proof relies on fine algebraic properties of the Euler system and combines together energy and effective energy estimates, dissipation and effective dissipation estimates, a nonlinear Sobolev inequality, high-integrability properties for the mass density and for the velocity, and compactness properties based on entropies.
