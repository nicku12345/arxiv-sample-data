We consider the semilinear electromagnetic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (-i\nabla+A(x))^{2}u + V(x)u = |u|^{2^{\ast}-2}u, u\in D_{A,0}^{1,2}(\Omega,\mathbb{C}), where \Omega=(\mathbb{R}^{m}\smallsetminus{0})\times\mathbb{R}^{N-m} with 2\leq m\leq N, N\geq3, 2^{\ast}:= 2N/(N-2) is the critical Sobolev exponent, V is a Hardy term and A is a singular magnetic potential of a particular form which includes the Aharonov-Bohm potentials. Under some symmetry assumptions on A we obtain multiplicity of solutions satisfying certain symmetry properties.
