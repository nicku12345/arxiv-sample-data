We first construct the global unique solution by assuming that the initial data is small in the H^3 norm but its higher order derivatives could be large. If further the initial data belongs to \Dot{H}^{-s} (0\le s<3/2) or \dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{-s} (0< s\le3/2), we obtain the various decay rates of the solution and its higher order derivatives. As an immediate byproduct, the L^p-L^2 (1\le p\le 2) type of the decay rates follow without requiring the smallness for L^p norm of initial data. In particular, the decay rate for the difference of densities could reach to (1+t)^{-13/4} in L^2 norm.
