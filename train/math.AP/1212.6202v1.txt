In the paper the Goursat problem with non classical boundary conditions not requiring the agreement conditions is considered for a sixth order pseudoparabolic equation with the classical boundary condition is substantiated in the case if the solution of the stated problem is sought in S.L.Sobolev anisotropic space.
