We consider the defocusing \dot{H}^{1/2}-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in dimensions d\geq 5. In the spirit of Kenig and Merle [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 362 (2010), 1937--1962], we combine a concentration-compactness approach with the Lin--Strauss Morawetz inequality to prove that if a solution u is bounded in \dot{H}^{1/2} throughout its lifespan, then u is global and scatters.
