In this article we find explicit formulae for spherically symmetric solutions of the multidimensional zero-pressure gas dynamics system and its adhesion approximation. The asymptotic behaviour of the explicit solutions of the adhesion approximation has been studied. The radial components of the velocity and density satisfy a simpler equation which enables us to get explicit formulae for different types of domains and study its asymptotic behaviour. A class of solutions for the inviscid system with conditions on the mass instead of conditions at origin has also been analyzed.
