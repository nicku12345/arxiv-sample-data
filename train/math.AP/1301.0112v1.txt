In this paper, we obtain sharp Strichartz estimates for solutions of the wave equation \square_\gg\phi=0 where \gg is a rough Lorentzian metric on a 4 dimensional space-time \MM. This is the last step of the proof of the bounded L^2 curvature conjecture proposed in [3], and solved by S. Klainerman, I. Rodnianski and the author in [8], which also relies on the sequence of papers [16][17][18][19]. Obtaining such estimates is at the core of the low regularity well-posedness theory for quasilinear wave equations. The difficulty is intimately connected to the regularity of the Eikonal equation \gg^{\a\b}\pr_\a u\pr_\b u=0 for a rough metric \gg. In order to be consistent with the final goal of proving the bounded L^2 curvature conjecture, we prove Strichartz estimates for all admissible Strichartz pairs under minimal regularity assumptions on the solutions of the Eikonal equation.
