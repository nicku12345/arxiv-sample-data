We study the persistence of the Gevrey class regularity of solutions to nonlinear wave equations with real analytic nonlinearity. Specifically, it is proven that the solution remains in a Gevrey class, with respect to some of its spatial variables, during its whole life-span, provided the initial data is from the same Gevrey class with respect to these spatial variables. In addition, for the special Gevrey class of analytic functions, we find a lower bound for the radius of the spatial analyticity of the solution that might shrink either algebraically or exponentially, in time, depending on the structure of the nonlinearity. The standard L^2 theory for the Gevrey class regularity is employed; we also employ energy-like methods for a generalized version of Gevrey classes based on the \ell^1 norm of Fourier transforms (Wiener algebra). After careful comparisons, we observe an indication that the \ell^1 approach provides a better lower bound for the radius of analyticity of the solutions than the L^2 approach. We present our results in the case of period boundary conditions, however, by employing exactly the same tools and proofs one can obtain similar results for the nonlinear wave equations and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, with real analytic nonlinearity, in certain domains and manifolds without physical boundaries, such as the whole space \mathbb{R}^n, or on the sphere \mathbb{S}^{n-1}.
