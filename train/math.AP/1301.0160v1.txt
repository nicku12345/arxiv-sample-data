In this paper, we prove the global existence and uniqueness of solution to d-dimensional (for d=2,3) incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations with initial density being bounded from above and below by some positive constants, and with initial velocity u_0\in H^s(\R^2) for s>0 in 2-D, or u_0\in H^1(\R^3) satisfying |u_0|_{L^2}|\na u_0|_{L^2} being sufficiently small in 3-D. This in particular improves the most recent well-posedness result in [10], which requires the initial velocity u_0\in H^2(\R^d) for the local well-posedness result, and a smallness condition on the fluctuation of the initial density for the global well-posedness result.
