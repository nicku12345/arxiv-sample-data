In this paper, we investigate the vanishing viscosity limit problem for the 3-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a general bounded smooth domain of R^3 with the generalized Navier-slip boundary conditions (\ref{VSg}). Some uniform estimates on rates of convergence in C([0,T],L^2(\Omega)) and C([0,T],H^1(\Omega)) of the solutions to the corresponding solutions of the idea Euler equations with the standard slip boundary condition are obtained.
