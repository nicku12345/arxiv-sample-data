In this paper, we employ Meyer wavelets to characterize multiplier spaces between Sobolev spaces without using capacity. Further, we introduce logarithmic Morrey spaces M^{t,\tau}_{r,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) to establish the inclusion relation between Morrey spaces and multiplier spaces. By wavelet characterization and fractal skills, we construct a counterexample to show that the scope of the index \tau of M^{t,\tau}_{r,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) is sharp. As an application, we consider a Schr\"odinger type operator with potentials in M^{t,\tau}_{r,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n}).
