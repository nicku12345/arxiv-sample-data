This paper deals with the study of "\textit{sharp localized}" solutions of a nonlinear type Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the whole space \R^N, N\ge1, with a zero order term, in modulus, like a power m less than one of the modulus of the solution, and with a non zero external forcing term \f. Our fundamental assumption is that such an exponent m verifies m\in (0,1). The self-similar structure of the solution is justified from the assumption that the external forcing term satisfies that \f(t,x)=t^{-(\vp-2)/2}\F(t^{-1/2}x) for some complex exponent \vp and for some profile function \F which is assumed to be with compact support in \R^N. We show the existence of solutions \vu(t,x)=t^{\vp/2}\U(t^{-1/2}x), with a profile \U, which also have compact support in \R^N, reason why we call as "\textit{sharp localized}" solutions to this type of solutions. The proof of the localization of the support of the profile \U uses some suitable energy method applied to the stationary problem satisfied by \U after some unknown transformation.
