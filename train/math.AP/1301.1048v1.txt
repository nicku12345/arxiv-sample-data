We present a numerical study of a derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general power nonlinearity, |\psi|^{2\sigma}\psi_x. In the L^2-supercritical regime, \sigma>1, our simulations indicate that there is a finite time singularity. We obtain a precise description of the local structure of the solution in terms of blowup rate and asymptotic profile, in a form similar to that of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with supercritical power law nonlinearity.
