In this article we establish optimal estimates for the first eigenvalue of Schr\"odinger operators on the d-dimensional unit sphere. These estimates depend on Lebsgue's norms of the potential, or of its inverse, and are equivalent to interpolation inequalities on the sphere. We also characterize a semi-classical asymptotic regime and discuss how our estimates on the sphere differ from those on the Euclidean space.
