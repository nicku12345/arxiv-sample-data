We show existence of a global weak dissipative solution of the Cauchy problem for the two-component Camassa-Holm (2CH) system on the line with nonvanishing and distinct spatial asymptotics. The influence from the second component in the 2CH system on the regularity of the solution, and, in particular, the consequences for wave breaking, is discussed. Furthermore, the interplay between dissipative and conservative solutions is treated.
