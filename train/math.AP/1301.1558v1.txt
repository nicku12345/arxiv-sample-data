We construct a global continuous semigroup of weak periodic conservative solutions to the two-component Camassa-Holm system, u_t-u_{txx}+\kappa u_x+3uu_x-2u_xu_{xx}-uu_{xxx}+\eta\rho\rho_x=0 and \rho_t+(u\rho)_x=0, for initial data (u,\rho)|_{t=0} in H^1_{\rm per}\times L^2_{\rm per}. It is necessary to augment the system with an associated energy to identify the conservative solution. We study the stability of these periodic solutions by constructing a Lipschitz metric. Moreover, it is proved that if the density \rho is bounded away from zero, the solution is smooth. Furthermore, it is shown that given a sequence \rho_0^n of initial values for the densities that tend to zero, then the associated solutions u^n will approach the global conservative weak solution of the Camassa-Holm equation. Finally it is established how the characteristics govern the smoothness of the solution.
