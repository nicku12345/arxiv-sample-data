We study the nonlinear fractional reaction diffusion equation \partial_{t}u + (-\Delta)^{s} u= f(t,x,u), s\in(0,1) in a bounded domain \Omega together with Dirichlet boundary conditions on \R^N \setminus \Omega. We prove asymptotic symmetry of nonnegative globally bounded solutions in the case where the underlying data obeys some symmetry and monotonicity assumptions. More precisely, we assume that \Omega is symmetric with respect to reflection at a hyperplane, say {x_1=0}, and convex in the x_1-direction, and that the nonlinearity f is even in x_1 and nonincreasing in |x_1|. Under rather weak additional technical assumptions, we then show that any nonzero element in the \omega-limit set of nonnegative globally bounded solution is even in x_1 and strictly decreasing in |x_1|. This result, which is obtained via a series of new estimates for antisymmetric supersolutions of a corresponding family of linear equations, implies a strong maximum type principle which is not available in the non-fractional case s=1.
