We consider nonlinear parabolic equations of the type  u_t - div a(x, t, Du)= f(x,t) on \Omega_T = \Omega\times (-T,0),  under standard growth conditions on a, with f only assumed to be integrable. We prove general decay estimates up to the boundary for level sets of the solutions u and the gradient Du which imply very general estimates in Lebesgue and Lorentz spaces. Assuming only that the involved domains satisfy a mild exterior capacity density condition, we provide global regularity results.
