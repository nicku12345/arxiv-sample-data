Given solenoidal vector u_0\in H^{-2\d}\cap H^1(\R^2), \r_0-1\in L^2(\R^2), and \r_0 \in L^\infty\cap\dot{W}^{1,r}(\R^2) with a positive lower bound for \d\in (0,\f12) and 2<r<\f{2}{1-2\d}, we prove that 2-D incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system \eqref{1.1} has a unique global solution provided that the viscous coefficient \mu(\r_0) is close enough to 1 in the L^\infty norm compared to the size of \d and the norms of the initial data. With smoother initial data, we can prove the propagation of regularities for such solutions. Furthermore, for 1<p<4, if (\r_0-1,u_0) belongs to the critical Besov spaces \dB^{\f2p}_{p,1}(\R^2)\times \bigl(\dB^{-1+\f2p}_{p,1}\cap L^2(\R^2)\bigr) and the \dB^{\f2p}_{p,1}(\R^2) norm of \r_0-1 is sufficiently small compared to the exponential of \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2+\|u_0\|_{\dB^{-1+\f2p}_{p,1}}, we prove the global well-posedness of \eqref{1.1} in the scaling invariant spaces. Finally for initial data in the almost critical Besov spaces, we prove the global well-posedness of \eqref{1.1} under the assumption that the L^\infty norm of \r_0-1 is sufficiently small.
