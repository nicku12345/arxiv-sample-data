In this note we study the property of unique continuation for solutions of |(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u|\leq|Vu|, where V is in a function class of potentials including \bigcup_{p>n/\alpha}L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) for n-1\leq\alpha<n. In particular, when n=2, our result gives a unique continuation theorem for the fractional (1<\alpha<2) Schr\"odinger operator (-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}+V(x) in the full range of \alpha values.
