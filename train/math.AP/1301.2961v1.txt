In this paper we study the Sobolev Trace Theorem for variable exponent spaces with critical exponents. We find conditions on the best constant in order to guaranty the existence of extremals. Then we give local conditions on the exponents and on the domain (in the spirit of Adimurthy and Yadava) in order to satisfy such conditions, and therefore to ensure the existence of extremals.
