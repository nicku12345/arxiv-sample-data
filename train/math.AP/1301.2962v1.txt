In this paper we study sufficient local conditions for the existence of non-trivial solution to a critical equation for the p(x)-Laplacian where the critical term is placed as a source through the boundary of the domain. The proof relies on a suitable generalization of the concentration--compactness principle for the trace embedding for variable exponent Sobolev spaces and the classical mountain pass theorem.
