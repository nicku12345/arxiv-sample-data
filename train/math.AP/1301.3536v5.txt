In this paper we will study the asymptotic behaviour of the energy decay of a transmission plate equation with force and moment feedback. Precisly, we shall prove that the energy decay at least logarithmically over the time. The method consist to use the classical second order Carleman estimate to estabish a resolvent estimate which provide by the famous Burq's result [Bur98] the kind of decay above mentionned.
