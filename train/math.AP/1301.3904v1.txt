When it is polarised, a cell develops an asymmetric distribution of specific molecular markers, cytoskeleton and cell membrane shape. Polarisation can occur spontaneously or be triggered by external signals, like gradients of signalling molecules... In this work, we use the published models of cell polarisation and we set a numerical analysis for these models. They are based on nonlinear convection-diffusion equations and the nonlinearity in the transport term expresses the positive loop between the level of protein concentration localised in a small area of the cell membrane and the number of new proteins that will be convected to the same area. We perform numerical simulations and we illustrate that these models are rich enough to describe the apparition of a polarisome.
