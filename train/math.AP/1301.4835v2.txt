In a recent paper, Struwe considered the Cauchy problem for a class of nonlinear wave and Scr\"odinger equations.   Under some assumptions on the nonlinearities, it was shown that uniqueness of classical solutions can be obtained in the much larger class of distribution solutions satisfying the energy inequality. As pointed out in [38], the conditions on the nonlinearities are satisfied for any polynomial growth but they fail to hold for higher growth (for example {\rm e}^{u^2}).   Our aim here is to improve Struwe's result by showing that uniqueness holds for more general nonlinearities including higher growth or oscillations.
