For S a positive selfadjoint operator on a Hilbert space, \[ \frac{d^2u}{dt}(t) + 2 F(S)\frac{du}{dt}(t) + S^2u(t)=0 \] describes a class of wave equations with strong friction or damping if F is a positive Borel function. Under suitable hypotheses, it is shown that \[ u(t)=v(t)+ w(t) \] where v satisfies \[ 2F(S)\frac{dv}{dt}(t)+ S^2v(t)=0 \] and \[ \frac{w(t)}{\|v(t)\|} \rightarrow 0, \; \text{as} \; t \rightarrow +\infty. \] The required initial condition v(0) is given in a canonical way in terms of u(0), u'(0).
