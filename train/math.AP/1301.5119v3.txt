Asymptotics of solutions to fractional elliptic equations with Hardy type potentials is studied in this paper. By using an Almgren type monotonicity formula, separation of variables, and blow-up arguments, we describe the exact behavior near the singularity of solutions to linear and semilinear fractional elliptic equations with a homogeneous singular potential related to the fractional Hardy inequality. As a consequence we obtain unique continuation properties for fractional elliptic equations.
