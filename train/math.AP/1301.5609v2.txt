We study dynamics of interfaces in solutions of the equation \epsilon \Box u + \frac 1 \epsilon f_\epsilon(u)=0, for f_\epsilon of the form f_\epsilon(u) = (u^2-1)(2u- \epsilon\kappa), for \kappa\in {\mathbb R}, as well as more general, but qualitatively similar, nonlinearities. We consider equations of this form both in (1+n)-dimensional Minkowski space, n\ge 1, and on certain more general Lorentzian manifolds, and we prove that for suitable initial data, solutions exhibit interfaces that sweep out timelike hypersurfaces of mean curvature proportional to \kappa. In particular, in 1 dimension these interfaces behave like a relativistic point particle subject to constant acceleration.
