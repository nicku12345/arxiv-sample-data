In this thesis we prove that the homogeneous incompressible Euler equation of hydrodynamics on the Sobolev spaces H^s(\R^n), n \geq 2 and s > n/2+1, can be expressed as a geodesic equation on an infinite dimensional manifold. As an application of this geometric formulation we prove that the solution map of the incompressible Euler equation, associating intial data in H^s(\R^n) to the corresponding solution at time t > 0, is nowhere locally uniformly continuous and nowhere differentiable.
