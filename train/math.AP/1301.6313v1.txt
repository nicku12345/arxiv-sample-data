In this paper, we are concerned with the global wellposedness of 3-D inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \eqref{1.3} in the critical Besov spaces with the norm of which are invariant by the scaling of the equations and under a nonlinear smallness condition on the isentropic critical Besov norm to the fluctuation of the initial density and the critical anisotropic Besov norm of the horizontal components of the initial velocity which have to be exponentially small compared with the critical anisotropic Besov norm to the third component of the initial velocity. The novelty of this results is that the isentropic space structure to the homogeneity of the initial density function is consistent with the propagation of anisotropic regularity for the velocity field. In the second part, we apply the same idea to prove the global wellposedness of \eqref{1.3} with some large data which are slowly varying in one direction.
