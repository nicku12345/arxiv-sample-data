In this paper, we establish a priori estimates for the three-dimensional compressible Euler equations with moving physical vacuum boundary, the \gamma-gas law equation of state for \gamma=2 and the general initial density \ri \in H^5. Because of the degeneracy of the initial density, we investigate the estimates of the horizontal spatial and time derivatives and then obtain the estimates of the normal or full derivatives through the elliptic-type estimates. We derive a mixed space-time interpolation inequality which play a vital role in our energy estimates and obtain some extra estimates for the space-time derivatives of the velocity in L^3.
