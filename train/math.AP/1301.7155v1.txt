This paper addresses the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid whose density is permitted to be inhomogeneous. We establish a theorem of global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for initial data with small \dot{H}^{\frac12}-norm, which also satisfies a natural compatibility condition. A key point of the theorem is that the initial density need not be strictly positive.
