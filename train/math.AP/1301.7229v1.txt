This note is a summary of the recent paper [9]. Here, we study the homogenization of elliptic systems with Dirichlet boundary condition, when both the coefficients and the boundary datum are oscillating.   In particular, in the paper [9], we showed that, the solutions converge in L2 with a power rate, and we identified the homogenized limit system and the homogenized boundary data. Due to a boundary layer phenomenon, this homogenized system depends in a non trivial way on the boundary. The analysis in [9] answers a longstanding open problem, raised for instance in [4]
