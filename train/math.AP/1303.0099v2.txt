We study the following singularly perturbed problem for a coupled nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system: {displaymath} {cases}-\e^2\Delta u +a(x) u = \mu_1 u^3+\beta uv^2, \quad x\in \R^3, -\e^2\Delta v +b(x) v =\mu_2 v^3+\beta vu^2, \quad x\in \R^3, u> 0, v> 0 \,\,\hbox{in \R^3}, u(x), v(x)\to 0 \,\,\hbox{as |x|\to \iy}.{cases}{displaymath} Here, a, b are nonnegative continuous potentials, and \mu_1,\mu_2>0. We consider the case where the coupling constant \beta>0 is relatively large. Then for sufficiently small \e>0, we obtain positive solutions of this system which concentrate around local minima of the potentials as \e\to 0. The novelty is that the potentials a and b may vanish at someplace and decay to 0 at infinity.
