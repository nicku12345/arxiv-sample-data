In this paper we study a coupled system modeling the movement of a deformable solid immersed in a fluid. For the solid we consider a given deformation that has to obey several physical constraints. The motion of the fluid is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a time-dependent bounded domain of \R^3, and the solid satisfies the Newton's laws. Our contribution consists in adapting and completing some results of ARMA 2008 in dimension 3, in a framework where the regularity of the deformation of the solid is limited. We rewrite the main system in domains which do not depend on time, by using a new means of defining a change of variables, and a suitable change of unknowns. We study the corresponding linearized system before setting a local-in-time existence result. Global existence is obtained for small data, and in particular for deformations of the solid which are arbitrarily close to the identity.
