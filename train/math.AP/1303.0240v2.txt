Given a Carnot-Carath\'eodory space \Om \sub \R^n with associated vector fields X=\{X_1,...,X_m\}, we derive the subelliptic \infty-Laplace system for mappings u : \Om \larrow \R^N, which reads \[ \label{1} \De^X_\infty u \, :=\, \Big(Xu \ot Xu + \|Xu\|^2 [Xu]^\bot \ot I \Big) : XX u\, = \, 0 \tag{1} \] in the limit of the subelliptic p-Laplacian as p\ri \infty. Here Xu is the horizontal gradient and [Xu]^\bot is the projection on its nullspace. Next, we identify the Variational Principle characterizing \eqref{1}, which is the "Euler-Lagrange PDE" of the supremal functional \[ \label{2} E_\infty(u,\Om)\ := \ \|Xu\|_{L^\infty(\Om)} \tag{2} \] for an appropriately defined notion of \emph{Horizontally \infty-Minimal Mappings}. We also establish a maximum principle for \|Xu\| for solutions to \eqref{1}. These results extend previous work of the author \cite{K1, K2} on vector-valued Calculus of Variations in L^\infty from the Euclidean to the subelliptic setting.
