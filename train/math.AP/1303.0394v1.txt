N\"orlund strong logarithmic means of double Fourier series acting from space % L\log L(\mathbb{T}^{2})  into space L_{p}(\mathbb{T}% ^{2}), 0<p<1 are studied. The maximal Orlicz space such that the N\"o% rlund strong logarithmic means of double Fourier series for the functions from this space converge in two-dimensional measure is found.
