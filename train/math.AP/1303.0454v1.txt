In this paper we consider the diffusive competition model consisting of an invasive species with density u and a native species with density v, in a radially symmetric setting with free boundary. We assume that v undergoes diffusion and growth in \R^N, and u exists initially in a ball \{r<h(0)\}, but invades into the environment with spreading front \{r=h(t)\}, with h(t) evolving according to the free boundary condition h'(t)=-\mu u_r(t, h(t)), where \mu>0 is a given constant and u(t,h(t))=0. Thus the population range of u is the expanding ball \{r<h(t)\}, while that for v is \R^N. In the case that u is a superior competitor (determined by the reaction terms), we show that a spreading-vanishing dichotomy holds, namely, as t\to\infty, either h(t)\to\infty and (u,v)\to (u^*,0), or \lim_{t\to\infty} h(t)<\infty and (u,v)\to (0,v^*), where (u^*,0) and (0, v^*) are the semitrivial steady-states of the system. Moreover, when spreading of u happens, some rough estimates of the spreading speed are also given. When u is an inferior competitor, we show that (u,v)\to (0,v^*) as t\to\infty.
