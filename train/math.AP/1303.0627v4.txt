Knowing a sequence of moments of a given, infinitely supported, distribution we obtain quickly: coefficients of the power series expansion of monic polynomials \left\{ p_{n}\right\} _{n\geq 0} that are orthogonal with respect to this distribution, coefficients of expansion of x^{n} in the series of p_{j}, j\leq n, two sequences of coefficients of the 3-term recurrence of the family of \left\{ p_{n}\right\} _{n\geq 0}, the so called "linearization coefficients" i.e. coefficients of expansion of % p_{n}p_{m} in the series of p_{j}, j\leq m+n.\newline Conversely, assuming knowledge of the two sequences of coefficients of the 3-term recurrence of a given family of orthogonal polynomials \left\{ p_{n}\right\} _{n\geq 0}, we express with their help: coefficients of the power series expansion of p_{n}, coefficients of expansion of x^{n} in the series of p_{j}, j\leq n, moments of the distribution that makes polynomials \left\{ p_{n}\right\} _{n\geq 0} orthogonal. \newline Further having two different families of orthogonal polynomials \left\{ p_{n}\right\} _{n\geq 0} and \left\{ q_{n}\right\} _{n\geq 0} and knowing for each of them sequences of the 3-term recurrences, we give sequence of the so called "connection coefficients" between these two families of polynomials. That is coefficients of the expansions of p_{n} in the series of q_{j}, j\leq n.\newline We are able to do all this due to special approach in which we treat vector of orthogonal polynomials \left\{ p_{j}\left( x)\right) \right\} _{j=0}^{n} as a linear transformation of the vector \left\{ x^{j}\right\} _{j=0}^{n} by some lower triangular (n+1)\times (n+1) matrix \mathbf{\Pi }_{n}.
