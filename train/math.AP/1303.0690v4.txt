We consider an instationary macroscopic system of self-interacting particles with an additional potential, the so called Bohm's potential. We study the existence of non-negative global solutions to the (4-th order) system of equations and allude the differences to results obtained for classical models. The problem is considered on a bounded domain up to three space dimension, subject to initial and Neumann boundary condition for the particle density, and Dirichlet boundary condition for the self-interacting potential. Moreover, the initial datum is only assumed to be non-negative and to satisfy a weak integrability condition.
