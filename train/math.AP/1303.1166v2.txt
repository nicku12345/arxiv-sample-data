\begin{abstract}\label{abstract} We consider a non-autonomous evolutionary problem \[ \dot{u} (t)+\A(t)u(t)=f(t), \quad u(0)=u_0 \] where the operator \A(t):V\to V^\prime is associated with a form \fra(t,.,.):V\times V \to \R and u_0\in V. Our main concern is to prove well-posedness with maximal regularity which means the following. Given a Hilbert space H such that V is continuously and densely embedded into H and given f\in L^2(0,T;H) we are interested in solutions u \in H^1(0,T;H)\cap L^2(0,T;V). We do prove well-posedness in this sense whenever the form is piecewise Lipschitz-continuous and symmetric. Moreover, we show that each solution is in C([0,T];V). We apply the results to non-autonomous Robin-boundary conditions and also use maximal regularity to solve a quasilinear problem.
