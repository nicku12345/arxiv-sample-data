The Cauchy problem for the cubic nonlinear Dirac equation in two space dimensions is locally well-posed for data in H^s for s > 1/2. The proof given in spaces of Bourgain-Klainerman-Machedon type relies on the null structure of the nonlinearity as used by d'Ancona-Foschi-Selberg for the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system before and bilinear Strichartz type estimates for the wave equation by Selberg and Foschi-Klainerman.
