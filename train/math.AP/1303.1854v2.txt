We prove the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem for fully nonlinear elliptic operators with periodic oscillation in the operator and of the boundary condition for a general class of smooth bounded domains. This extends the previous results of Barles and Mironescu in half spaces. We show that homogenization holds despite a possible lack of continuity in the homogenized boundary data. The proof is based on a comparison principle with partial Dirichlet boundary data which is of independent interest.
