Using results on inverse spectral problems, in particular the so-called new wave invariants attached to a classical equilibrium, we show that it is possible to determine the Morse index of height functions. For compact Riemannian surfaces M\subset \mathbb{R}^3 this imply that we can retrieve the topology (via the genus).   Our results are independent from the choice of a metric on M and can be obtained from the choice of a 'generic' height-function. For surfaces of genus zero, diffeomorphic to a 2-sphere, the method allows to detect the convexity, or the local convexity of the surface.
