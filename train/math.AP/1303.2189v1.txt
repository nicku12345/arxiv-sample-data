In this paper we study quantitative uniqueness estimates of solutions to general second order elliptic equations with magnetic and electric potentials. We derive lower bounds of decay rate at infinity for any nontrivial solution under some general assumptions. The lower bounds depend on asymptotic behaviors of magnetic and electric potentials. The proof is carried out by the Carleman method and the bootstrapping arguments.
