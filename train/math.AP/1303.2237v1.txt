For a class of one-dimensional linear elliptic fourth-order equations with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions it is shown that a non-positive and non-vanishing right-hand side gives rise to a negative solution. A similar result is obtained for the same class of equations for radially symmetric solutions in a ball or in an annulus. Several applications are given, including applications to nonlinear equations and eigenvalue problems.
