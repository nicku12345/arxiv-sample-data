We consider degenerate Monge-Ampere equations of the type \det D^2 u= f \quad \{in \Om}, \quad \quad f \sim \, d_{\p \Om}^\alpha \quad \{near \p \Om,} where d_{\p \Om} represents the distance to the boundary of the domain \Om and \alpha>0 is a positive power. We obtain C^2 estimates at the boundary under natural conditions on the boundary data and the right hand side. Similar estimates in two dimensions were obtained by J.X. Hong, G. Huang and W. Wang.
