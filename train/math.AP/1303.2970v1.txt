We establish symmetrization results for the solutions of the linear fractional diffusion equation \partial_t u +(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}u=f and itselliptic counterpart h v +(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}v=f, h>0, using the concept of comparison of concentrations. The results extend to the nonlinear version, \partial_t u+(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}A(u)=f, but only when A:\re_+\to\re_+ is a concave function. In the elliptic case, complete symmetrization results are proved for \,B(v)+(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}v=f \ when B(v) is a convex nonnegative function for v>0 with B(0)=0, and partial results when B is concave. Remarkable counterexamples are constructed for the parabolic equation when A is convex, resp. for the elliptic equation when B is concave. Such counterexamples do not exist in the standard diffusion case \sigma=2.
