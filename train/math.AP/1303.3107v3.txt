A nonstandard system of differential equations describing two-species phase segregation is considered. This system naturally arises in the asymptotic analysis recently done by Colli, Gilardi, Krejci and Sprekels as the diffusion coefficient in the equation governing the evolution of the order parameter tends to zero. In particular, a well-posedness result is proved for the limit system. This paper deals with the above limit problem in a less general but still very significant framework and provides a very simple proof of further regularity for the solution. As a byproduct, a simple uniqueness proof is given as well.
