In this paper, we establish boundary H\"older gradient estimates for solutions to the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations with L^{p} (n<p\leq\infty) right hand side and C^{1,\gamma} boundary values under natural assumptions on the domain, boundary data and the Monge-Amp\`ere measure. These estimates extend our previous boundary regularity results for solutions to the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations with bounded right hand side and C^{1, 1} boundary data.
