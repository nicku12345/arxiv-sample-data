We are concerned with travelling wave solutions arising in a reaction diffusion equation with bistable and nonlocal nonlinearity, for which the comparison principle does not hold. Stability of the equilibrium u\equiv 1 is not assumed. We construct a travelling wave solution connecting 0 to an unknown steady state, which is "above and away", from the intermediate equilibrium. For focusing kernels we prove that, as expected, the wave connects 0 to 1. Our results also apply readily to the nonlocal ignition case.
