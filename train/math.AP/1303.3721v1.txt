A connected, linearly ordered path \ga \subset R^n satisfying  x_1\prec x_2\prec x_3 \in \ga, and x_1 \prec x_2 \prec x_3 \Rightarrow |x_2 - x_1| \leq | x_3 - x_1| is shown to be a rectifiable curve; a priori bounds for its length are given; moreover, these paths are generalized steepest descent curves of suitable quasi convex functions. Properties of quasi convex families are considered; special curves related to quasi convex families are defined and studied; they are generalizations of steepest descent curves for quasi convex functions and satisfy the previous property. Existence, uniqueness, stability results and length's bounds are proved for them.
