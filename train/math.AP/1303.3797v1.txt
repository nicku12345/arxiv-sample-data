We prove the existence of entire solutions with exponential growth for the semilinear elliptic system [\begin{cases} -\Delta u = -u v^2 & \text{in \R^N} -\Delta v= -u^2 v & \text{in \R^N} u,v>0, \end{cases}] for every N \ge 2. Our construction is based on an approximation procedure, whose convergence is ensured by suitable Almgren-type monotonicity formulae. The construction of \emph{some} solutions is extended to systems with k components, for every k > 2.
