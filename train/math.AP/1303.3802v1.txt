I will give a discussion of the conditions involved in Treves' conjecture on analytic hypoellipticity. I will discuss some microlocally characteristic sets and introduce a topology of monotropic functionals as suitable for solving the conjecture. The pseudodifferential operator representation is inspired by Cousin.
