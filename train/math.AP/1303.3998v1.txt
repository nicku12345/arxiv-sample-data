We study the singular limit of a rotating compressible fluid described by a scaled barotropic Navier-Stokes system, where the Rossby number, the Mach number and the Froude number tend to 0 in a particular mutual rate while the Reynolds number tends to infinity. The inviscid planar Euler system is identified as the limit problem. The proof is based on the application of the method of relative entropies and careful analysis of oscillatory integrals describing the propagation of Rossby-acoustic waves.
