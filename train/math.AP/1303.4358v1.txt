Let (SD_\Omega) be the Stokes operator defined in a bounded domain \Omega of R^3 with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove that, generically with respect to the domain \Omega with C^5 boundary, the spectrum of (SD_\Omega) satisfies a non resonant property introduced by C. Foias and J. C. Saut to linearize the Navier-Stokes system in a bounded domain \Omega of R^3 with Dirichlet boundary conditions. For that purpose, we first prove that, generically with respect to the domain \Omega with C^5 boundary, all the eigenvalues of (SD_\Omega) are simple. That answers positively a question raised by J. H. Ortega and E. Zuazua. The proofs of these results follow a standard strategy based on a contradiction argument requiring shape differentiation. One needs to shape differentiate at least twice the initial problem in the direction of carefully chosen domain variations. The main step of the contradiction argument amounts to study the evaluation of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators associated to these domain variations.
