In this paper we establish existence and nonexistence results concerning fully nontrivial minimal energy solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger system   \begin{align*}   \begin{gathered}   -\Delta u + \, u = |u|^{2q-2}u + b|u|^{q-2}u|v|^q \quad\text{in}\R^n,   -\Delta v + \omega^2 v = |v|^{2q-2}v + b|u|^q|v|^{q-2}v\quad\text{in}\R^n.   \end{gathered}   \end{align*}   We consider the repulsive case b<0 and assume that the exponent q satisfies 1<q<\frac{n}{n-2} in case n\geq 3 and 1<q<\infty in case n=1 or n=2. For space dimensions n\geq 2 and arbitrary b<0 we prove the existence of fully nontrivial nonnegative solutions which converge to a solution of some optimal partition problem as b\to -\infty. In case n=1 we prove that minimal energy solutions exist provided the coupling parameter b has small absolute value whereas fully nontrivial solutions do not exist if 1<q\leq 2 and b has large absolute value.
