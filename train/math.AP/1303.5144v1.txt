In this article we develop a simplistic approach to revisit the classical Kato-Ponce inequality, which is also known as 'fractional Leibniz rule.' As a consequence, we derive the validity of this inequality even in quasi-Banach spaces L^p for p<1 with a certain restrictions on the indices. Also, we display the sharpness of this restriction by means of a counter-example. Finally, we also prove a multi-parameter variant of the inequality, which allows for partial fractional derivatives on R^n.
