We are concerned with Liouville-type results of stable solutions and finite Morse index solutions for the following nonlinear elliptic equation with Hardy potential: \begin{displaymath} \Delta u+\dfrac{\mu}{|x|^2}u+|x|^l |u|^{p-1}u=0 \qquad \textrm{in}\ \ \Omega, \end{displaymath} where \Omega=\RN, \RN\setminus\{0\} for N\geq3, p>1, l>-2 and \mu<(N-2)^2/4. Our results depend crucially on a new critical exponent p=p_c(l,\mu) and the parameter \mu in Hardy term. We prove that there exist no nontrivial stable solution and finite Morse index solution for 1<p<p_c(l,\mu). We also observe a range of the exponent p larger than p_c(l,\mu) satisfying that our equation admits a positive radial stable solution.
