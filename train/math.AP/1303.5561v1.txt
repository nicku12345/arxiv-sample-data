The connection between the Anti-Wick and Weyl quantization is given for certain class of global symbols, which corresponding pseudodifferential operators act continuously on the space of tempered ultradistributions of Beurling, respectively, of Roumieu type. The largest subspace of ultradistributions is found for which the convolution with the gaussian kernel exist. This gives a way to extend the definition of Anti-Wick quantization for symbols that are not necessarily tempered ultradistributions.
