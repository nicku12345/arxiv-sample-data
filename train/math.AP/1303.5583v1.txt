We consider the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for isentropic dynamics with real viscosity on a bounded interval. In the case of boundary data defining an admissible shock wave for the corresponding unviscous hyperbolic system, we determine a scalar differential equation describing the motion of the internal transition layer. In particular, for small viscosity, the velocity of the motion is exponentially small. The approach is based on the construction of a one-parameter manifold of approximate solutions and on an appropriate projection of the evolution of the complete Navier-Stokes system towards such manifold.
