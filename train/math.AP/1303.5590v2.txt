We propose a high resolution finite volume scheme for a (m+1)x(m+1) system of non strictly hyperbolic conservation laws which models multicomponent polymer flooding in enhanced oil-recovery process in two dimensions. In the presence of gravity the flux functions need not be monotone and hence the exact Riemann problem is complicated and computationally expensive. To overcome this difficulty, we use the idea of discontinuous flux to reduce the coupled system into uncoupled system of scalar conservation laws with discontinuous coefficients. High order accurate scheme is constructed by introducing slope limiter in space variable and a strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme in the time variable. The performance of the numerical scheme is presented in various situations by choosing a heavily heterogeneous hard rock type medium. Also the significance of dissolving multiple polymers in aqueous phase is presented
