We study the break-down mechanism of smooth solution for the gravity water-wave equation of infinite depth. It is proved that if the mean curvature \kappa of the free surface \Sigma_t, the trace (V,B) of the velocity at the free surface, and the outer normal derivative \frac {\pa P} {\pa \textbf{n}} of the pressure P satisfy \beno &&\displaystyle\sup_{t\in [0,T]}\|\kappa(t)\|_{L^p\cap L^2}+\int_0^T\|(\na V, \na B)(t)\|_{L^\infty}^6dt<+\infty, &\displaystyle\inf_{(t,x,y)\in [0,T]\times \Sigma_t}-\frac {\pa P} {\pa \textbf{n}}(t,x,y)\ge c_0, \eeno for some p>2d and c_0>0, then the solution can be extended after t=T.
