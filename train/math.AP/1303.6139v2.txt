This work deals with the semi linear equation -\Delta u+u-u^p=0 in \R^N, 2\leq p<{N+2\over N-2}. We consider the positive solutions which are {2\pi\over\ep}-periodic in x_1 and decreasing to 0 in the other variables, uniformly in x_1. Let a periodic configuration of points be given on the x_1-axis, which repel each other as the period tends to infinity. If there exists a solution which has these points as peaks, we prove that the points must be asymptotically uniformly distributed on the x_1-axis. Then, for \ep small enough, we prove the uniqueness up to a translation of the positive solution with some peaks on the x_1-axis, for a given minimal period in x_1.
