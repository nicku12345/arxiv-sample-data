This paper is concerned with the cubic Szeg\H{o} equation  i\partial_t u=\Pi(|u|^2 u),  defined on the L^2 Hardy space on the one-dimensional torus \mathbb T, where \Pi: L^2(\mathbb T)\rightarrow L^2_+(\mathbb T) is the Szeg\H{o} projector onto the non-negative frequencies. For analytic initial data, it is shown that the solution remains spatial analytic for all time t\in (-\infty,\infty). In addition, we find a lower bound for the radius of analyticity of the solution. Our method involves energy-like estimates of the special Gevrey class of analytic functions based on the \ell^1 norm of Fourier transforms (the Wiener algebra).
