Using elementary arguments based on the Fourier transform we prove that for 1 \leq q < p < \infty and s \geq 0 with s > n(1/2-1/p), if f \in L^{q,\infty}(\R^n) \cap \dot{H}^s(\R^n) then f \in L^p(\R^n) and there exists a constant c_{p,q,s} such that   \[ \|f\|_{L^p} \leq c_{p,q,s} \|f\|_{L^{q,\infty}}^\theta \|f\|_{\dot H^s}^{1-\theta}, \] where 1/p = \theta/q + (1-\theta)(1/2-s/n). In particular, in \R^2 we obtain the generalised Ladyzhenskaya inequality \|f\|_{L^4}\le c\|f\|_{L^{2,\infty}}^{1/2}\|f\|_{\dot H^1}^{1/2}. We also show that for s=n/2 the norm in \|f\|_{\dot H^{n/2}} can be replaced by the norm in BMO. As well as giving relatively simple proofs of these inequalities, this paper provides a brief primer of some basic concepts in harmonic analysis, including weak spaces, the Fourier transform, the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem, and Calderon-Zygmund decompositions.
