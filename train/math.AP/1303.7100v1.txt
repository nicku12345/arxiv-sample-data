We provide a honesty theory of substochastic evolution families in real abstract state space, extending to an non-autonomous setting the result obtained for C_0-semigroups in our recent contribution \textit{[On perturbed substochastic semigroups in abstract state spaces, \textit{Z. Anal. Anwend.} \textbf{30}, 457--495, 2011]}. The link with the honesty theory of perturbed substochastic semigroups is established. Several applications to non-autonomous linear kinetic equations (linear Boltzmann equation and fragmentation equation) are provided.
