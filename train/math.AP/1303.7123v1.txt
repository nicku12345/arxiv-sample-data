We generalize the Abstract Interpolation Lemma proved by the authors in [2]. Using this extension, we show in a more general context, the persistence property for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, see (1.2), in the weighted Sobolev space with low regularity in the weight. The method used can be applied for other nonlinear dispersive models, for instance the multidimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation.
