We consider the problem of neutral inclusions for two-dimensional conductivity and anti-plane elasticity. The neutral inclusion, when inserted in a matrix having a uniform field, does not disturb the field outside the inclusion. The inclusion consists of a core and a shell. We show that if the inclusion is neutral to two linearly independent fields, then the core and the shell are confocal ellipses.
