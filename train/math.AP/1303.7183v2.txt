We establish non-existence results for the Cauchy problem of some semilinear heat equations with non-negative initial data and locally Lipschitz, nonnegative source term f. Global (in time) solutions of the scalar ODE \dot v=f(v) exist for v(0)>0 if and only if the Osgood-type condition \int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{\dee s}{f(s)} =\infty holds; by comparison this ensures the existence of global classical solutions of u_t=\Delta u+f(u) for bounded initial data u_0\in L^{\infty}(\R^n). It is natural to ask whether the Osgood condition is sufficient to ensure that the problem still admits global solutions if the initial data is in L^q(\R^n) for some 1\le q<\infty. Here we answer this question in the negative, and in fact show that there are initial conditions for which there exists no local solution in L^1_{\rm loc}(\R^n) for t>0.
