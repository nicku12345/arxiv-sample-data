We discuss equations associated to Cournot-Nash Equilibria as put forward recently by Blanchet and Carlier. These equations are related to an optimal transport problem in which the source measure is known, but the target measure is part of the problem. The resulting equation is a Monge-Amp\`ere type with possible nonlocal terms. If the cost function is of a particular form, the equation is vulnerable to standard optimal transportation PDE techniques, with some modifications to deal with the new terms. We give some conditions on the problem from which we can conclude that solutions are smooth.
