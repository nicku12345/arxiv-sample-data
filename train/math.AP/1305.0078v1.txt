Let  \ti \Om  be a bounded convex domain in Euclidean  n  space,  \hat x \in \ar \ti \Om,  and  r > 0.  Let  \ti u = (\ti u^1, \ti u^2, \dots, \ti u^N)  be a weak solution to \[\nabla \cdot \left (|\nabla \ti u |^{p-2} \nabla \ti u \right) = 0 \mbox{in} \ti \Om \cap B (\hat x, 4 r) \mbox{with} |\nabla \ti u|^{p-2} \, \ti u_\nu = 0 \mbox{on} \ar \ti \Om \cap B (\hat x, 4 r). \] We show that sub solution type arguments for certain uniformly elliptic systems can be used to deduce that  | \nabla \ti u |  is bounded in  \ti \Om \cap B (\hat x, r) with constants depending only on  n, p, N.  and  \frac{r^n}{| \ti \Om \cap B (\hat x, r) |}. Our argument replaces an argument based on level sets in recent important work of [CM], [CM1], [GS], [M], [M1], involving similar problems.
