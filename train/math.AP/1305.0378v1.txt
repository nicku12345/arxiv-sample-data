For the logarithmically singular parabolic equation \[ u_t-\Delta\ln u=0\qquad\text{weakly in}\ \ E\times(0,T], \] we establish a Harnack type estimate in the L^1_{loc} topology, and we show that the solutions are locally analytic in the space variables and differentiable in time. The main assumption is that \ln u possesses a sufficiently high degree of integrability, namely \begin{equation*} \ln u\in L^\infty_{loc}\big(0,T;L^p_{loc}(E)\big) \quad\text{for some} p\ge1. \end{equation*} These two properties are known for solutions of singular porous medium type equations (0<m<1), which formally approximate the logarithmically singular equation. However, the corresponding estimates deteriorate as m\to0. It is shown that these estimates become stable and carry to the limit as m\to0, provided the indicated sufficiently high order of integrability is in force. The latter then appears as the discriminating assumption between solutions of parabolic equations with power-like singularities and logarithmic singularities to insure such solutions to be regular.
