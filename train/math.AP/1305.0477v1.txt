In this paper we deduce by {\Gamma}-convergence some partially and fully linearized quasistatic evolution models for thin plates, in the framework of finite plasticity. Denoting by {\epsilon} the thickness of the plate, we study the case where the scaling factor of the elasto- plastic energy is of order {\epsilon}^ (2{\alpha}-2), with {\alpha}>=3. We show that solutions to the three- dimensional quasistatic evolution problems converge, as the thickness of the plate tends to zero, to a quasistatic evolution associated to a suitable reduced model depending on {\alpha}.
