We show that to each symmetric elliptic operator of the form \[ \mathcal{A} = - \sum \partial_k \, a_{kl} \, \partial_l + c \] on a bounded Lipschitz domain \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d one can associate a self-adjoint Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on L_2(\partial \Omega), which may be multi-valued if 0 is in the Dirichlet spectrum of \mathcal{A}. To overcome the lack of coerciveness in this case, we employ a new version of the Lax--Milgram lemma based on an indirect ellipticity property that we call hidden compactness. We then establish uniform resolvent convergence of a sequence of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators whenever their coefficients converge uniformly and the second-order limit operator in L_2(\Omega) has the unique continuation property. We also consider semigroup convergence.
