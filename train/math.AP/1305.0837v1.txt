This paper is concerned with the study of solutions to discrete parabolic equations in divergence form with random coefficients, and their convergence to solutions of a homogenized equation.   In [11] rate of convergence results in homogenization and estimates on the difference between the averaged Green's function and the homogenized Green's function for random environments which satisfy a Poincar\'{e} inequality were obtained. Here these results are extended to certain environments in which correlations can have arbitrarily small power law decay. Similar results for discrete elliptic equations were obtained in [12].
