We study the existence of weak solutions of (E)  (-\Delta)^\alpha u+g(u)=\nu  in a bounded regular domain \Omega in \R^N (N\ge2) which vanish on \R^N\setminus\Omega, where (-\Delta)^\alpha denotes the fractional Laplacian with \alpha\in(0,1), \nu is a Radon measure and g is a nondecreasing function satisfying some extra hypothesis. When g satisfies a subcritical integrability condition, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for problem (E) for any measure. In the case where \nu is Dirac measure, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the solution. When g(r)=|r|^{k-1}r with k supercritical, we show that a condition of absolute continuity of the measure with respect to some Bessel capacity is a necessary and sufficient condition in order (E) to be solved.
