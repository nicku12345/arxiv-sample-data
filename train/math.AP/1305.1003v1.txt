In this paper, we are concerned with the quasilinear PDE with weight  -div A(x,\nabla u)=|x|^a u^q(x), \quad u>0 \quad \textrm{in} \quad R^n,  where n \geq 3, q>p-1 with p \in (1,2] and a \in (-n,0]. The positive weak solution u of the quasilinear PDE is \mathcal{A}-superharmonic and satisfies \inf_{R^n}u=0. We can introduce an integral equation involving the wolff potential  u(x)=R(x) W_{\beta,p}(|y|^au^q(y))(x), \quad u>0 \quad \textrm{in} \quad R^n,  which the positive solution u of the quasilinear PDE satisfies. Here p \in (1,2], q>p-1, \beta>0 and 0 \leq -a<p\beta<n. When 0<q \leq \frac{(n+a)(p-1)}{n-p\beta}, there does not exist any positive solution to this integral equation. When q>\frac{(n+a)(p-1)}{n-p\beta}, the positive solution u of the integral equation is bounded and decays with the fast rate \frac{n-p\beta}{p-1} if and only if it is integrable (i.e. it belongs to L^{\frac{n(q-p+1)}{p\beta+a}}(R^n)). On the other hand, if the bounded solution is not integrable and decays with some rate, then the rate must be the slow one \frac{p\beta+a}{q-p+1}. Thus, all the properties above are still true for the quasilinear PDE. Finally, several qualitative properties for this PDE are discussed.
