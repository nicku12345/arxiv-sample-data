We consider the inverse problem of determining the time independent scalar potential of the dynamic Schr\"odinger equation in an infinite cylindrical domain, from one Neumann boundary observation of the solution. Assuming that this potential is known outside some fixed compact subset of the waveguide, we prove that it may be Lipschitz stably retrieved by choosing the Dirichlet boundary condition of the system suitably. Since the proof is by means of a global Carleman estimate designed specifically for the Schr\"odinger operator acting in an unbounded cylindrical domain, the Neumann data is measured on an infinitely extended subboundary of the cylinder.
