The present paper is devoted to the well-posedness issue for a low-Mach number limit system with heat conduction but no viscosity. We will work in the framework of general Besov spaces B^s_{p,r}(\R^d), d\geq 2, which can be embedded into the class of Lipschitz functions.   Firstly, we consider the case of p\in[2,4], with no further restrictions on the initial data. Then we tackle the case of any p\in\,]1,\infty], but requiring also a finite energy assumption. The extreme value p=\infty can be treated due to a new a priori estimate for parabolic equations. At last we also briefly consider the case of any p\in ]1,\infty[ but with smallness condition on initial inhomogeneity.   A continuation criterion and a lower bound for the lifespan of the solution are proved as well. In particular in dimension 2, the lower bound goes to infinity as the initial density tends to a constant.
