In this paper we obtain an energy estimate for a complete strictly hyperbolic operator with second order coefficients satisfying a log-Zygmund-continuity condition with respect to t, uniformly with respect to x, and a log-Lipschitz-continuity condition with respect to x, uniformly with respect to t.
