We consider the global existence and blow up of solutions of the Cauchy problem of the quasilinear wave equation: \partial_{t}^2 u = \partial_x(c(u)^2 \partial_x u), which has richly physical backgrounds. Under the assumption that c(u(0,x))\geq \delta for some \delta>0, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of global smooth solutions and the occurrence of two types of blow-up respectively. One of the two types is that L^{\infty}-norm of \partial_t u or \partial_x u goes up to the infinity. The other type is that c(u) vanishes, that is, the equation degenerates.
