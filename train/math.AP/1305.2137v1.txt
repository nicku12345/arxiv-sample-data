For p\in (1,+\infty) and b \in (0, +\infty] the p-torsion function with Robin boundary conditions associated to an arbitrary open set \Om \subset \R^m satisfies formally the equation -\Delta_p =1 in \Om and |\nabla u|^{p-2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + b|u|^{p-2} u =0 on \partial \Om. We obtain bounds of the L^\infty norm of u {\it only} in terms of the bottom of the spectrum (of the Robin p-Laplacian), b and the dimension of the space in the following two extremal cases: the linear framework (corresponding to p=2) and arbitrary b>0, and the non-linear framework (corresponding to arbitrary p>1) and Dirichlet boundary conditions (b=+\infty). In the general case, p\not=2, p \in (1, +\infty) and b>0 our bounds involve also the Lebesgue measure of \Om.
