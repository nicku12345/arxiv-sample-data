In this paper, the Buckley-Feuring method (BFM) and the variational iteration method (VIM) are used for find exact fuzzy solution of the fuzzy heat-like equations in one and two dimensions. Several examples are given to show the new theorem of Buckley-Feuring solution and the Seikkala solution. The results obtained in all cases show the reliability and the efficiency of this methods.
