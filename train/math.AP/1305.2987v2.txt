We consider a family of dissipative active scalar equations outside the L^{2}-space. This was introduced in [D. Chae, P. Constantin, J. Wu, to appear in IUMJ (2014)] and its velocity fields are coupled with the active scalar via a class of multiplier operators which morally behave as derivatives of positive order. We prove global well-posedness and time decay of solutions, without smallness assumptions, for initial data belonging to the critical Lebesgue space L^{\frac{n}{\gamma-\beta}}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) which is a class larger than that of the above reference. Symmetry properties of solutions are investigated depending on the symmetry of initial data and coupling operators.
