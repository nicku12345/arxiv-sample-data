In this note we show the characteristic function of every indecomposable set F in the plane is BV equivalent to the characteristic function a closed set \mathbb{F}, i.e. ||\mathbb{1}_{F}-\mathbb{1}_{\mathbb{F}}||_{BV(\mathbb{R}^2)}=0. We show by example this is false in dimension three and above. As a corollary to this result we show that for every \epsilon>0 a set of finite perimeter S can be approximated by a closed subset \mathbb{S}_{\epsilon} with finitely many indecomposable components and with the property that H^1(\partial^M \mathbb{S}_{\epsilon}\backslash \partial^M S)=0 and ||\mathbb{1}_{S}-\mathbb{1}_{\mathbb{S}_{\epsilon}}||_{BV(\mathbb{R}^2)}<\epsilon. We apply this corollary to give a short proof that locally quasiminimizing sets in the plane are BV_l extension domains.
