We consider singularly perturbed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations \be \label{eq:0.1} - \varepsilon^2 \Delta u + V(x)u = f(u), \ \ u > 0, \ \ v \in H^1(\R^N) \ee where V \in C(\R^N, \R) and f is a nonlinear term which satisfies the so-called Berestycki-Lions conditions. We assume that there exists a bounded domain \Omega \subset \R^N such that \[m_0 \equiv \inf_{x \in \Omega} V(x) < \inf_{x \in \partial \Omega} V(x) \] and we set K = \{x \in \Omega \ | \ V(x) = m_0\}. For \e >0 small we prove the existence of at least {\cuplength}(K) + 1 solutions to (\ref{eq:0.1}) concentrating, as \e \to 0 around K. We remark that, under our assumptions of f, the search of solutions to (\ref{eq:0.1}) cannot be reduced to the study of the critical points of a functional restricted to a Nehari manifold.
