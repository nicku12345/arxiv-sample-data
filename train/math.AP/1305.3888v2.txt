We establish a unique continuation property for stochastic heat equations evolving in a bounded domain G. Our result shows that the value of the solution can be determined uniquely by means of its value on an arbitrary open subdomain of G at any given positive time constant. Further, when G is convex and bounded, we also give a quantitative version of the unique continuation property. As applications, we get an observability estimate for stochastic heat equations, an approximate result and a null controllability result for a backward stochastic heat equation.
