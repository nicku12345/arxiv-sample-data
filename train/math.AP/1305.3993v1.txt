We consider a class of defocusing energy-supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in four space dimensions. Following a concentration-compactness approach, we show that for 1<s_c<3/2, any solution that remains bounded in the critical Sobolev space \dot{H}_x^{s_c}(\R^4) must be global and scatter. Key ingredients in the proof include a long-time Strichartz estimate and a frequency-localized interaction Morawetz inequality.
