We address the deterministic homogenization, in the general context of ergodic algebras, of a doubly nonlinear problem which generalizes the well known Stefan model, and includes the classical porous medium equation. It may be represented by the differential inclusion, for a real-valued function u(x,t),    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\partial_u \Psi(x/\ve,x,u)-\nabla_x\cdot \nabla_\eta\psi( x/\ve,x,t,u,\nabla u) \ni f(x/\ve,x,t, u),  on a bounded domain \Om\subset \R^n, t\in(0,T), together with initial-boundary conditions, where \Psi(z,x,\cdot) is strictly convex and \psi(z,x,t,u,\cdot) is a C^1 convex function, both with quadratic growth, satisfying some additional technical hypotheses. As functions of the oscillatory variable, \Psi(\cdot,x,u),\psi(\cdot,x,t,u,\eta) and f(\cdot,x,t,u) belong to the generalized Besicovitch space \BB^2 associated with an arbitrary ergodic algebra \AA. The periodic case was addressed by Visintin (2007), based on the two-scale convergence technique. Visintin's analysis for the periodic case relies heavily on the possibility of reducing two-scale convergence to the usual L^2 convergence in the cartesian product \Pi\X\R^n, where \Pi is the periodic cell. This reduction is no longer possible in the case of a general ergodic algebra. To overcome this difficulty, we make essential use of the concept of two-scale Young measures for algebras with mean value, associated with bounded sequences in L^2.
