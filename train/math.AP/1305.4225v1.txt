The principal aim of this short note is to extend a recent result on Gaussian heat kernel bounds for self-adjoint L^2(\Om; d^n x)-realizations, n\in\bbN, n\geq 2, of divergence form elliptic partial differential expressions L with (nonlocal) Robin-type boundary conditions in bounded Lipschitz domains \Om \subset \bbR^n, where  Lu = - \sum_{j,k=1}^n\partial_j a_{j,k}\partial_k u.  The (nonlocal) Robin-type boundary conditions are then of the form  \nu\cdot A\nabla u + \Theta\big[u\big|_{\partial\Om}\big]=0 \, \text{on} \, \partial\Omega,  where \Theta represents an appropriate operator acting on Sobolev spaces associated with the boundary \partial \Om of \Om, and \nu denotes the outward pointing normal unit vector on \partial\Om.
