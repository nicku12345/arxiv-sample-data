We prove existence results concerning equations of the type -\Delta_pu=P(u)+\mu for p>1 and F_k[-u]=P(u)+\mu with 1\leq k<\frac{N}{2} in a bounded domain \Omega or the whole \mathbb{R}^N, where \mu is a positive Radon measure and P(u)\sim e^{au^\beta} with a>0 and \beta\geq 1. Sufficient conditions for existence are expressed in terms of the fractional maximal potential of \mu. Two-sided estimates on the solutions are obtained in terms of some precise Wolff potentials of \mu. Necessary conditions are obtained in terms of Orlicz capacities. We also establish existence results for a general Wolff potential equation under the form u={\bf W}_{\alpha,p}^R[P(u)]+f in \mathbb{R}^N, where 0
