We examine the equation given by \begin{equation} \label{eq_abstract} -\Delta u + a(x) \cdot \nabla u = u^p \qquad \mbox{in  \IR^N,} \end{equation} where p>1 and  a(x) is a smooth vector field satisfying some decay conditions. We show that for  p < p_c, the Joseph-Lundgren exponent, that there is no positive stable solution of (\ref{eq_abstract}) provided one imposes a smallness condition on a along with a divergence free condition. In the other direction we show that for  N \ge 4 and  p > \frac{N-1}{N-3} there exists a positive solution of (\ref{eq_abstract}) provided a satisfies a smallness condition. For  p>p_c we show the existence of a positive stable solution of (\ref{eq_abstract}) provided a is divergence free and satisfies a smallness condition.
