In this paper, we establish an optimal blow-up criterion for classical solutions to the incompressible resistive Hall-magnetohydrodynamic equations. We also prove two global-in-time existence results of the classical solutions for small initial data, the smallness conditions of which are given by the suitable Sobolev and the Besov norms respectively. Although the Sobolev space version is already an improvement of the corrresponding result in \cite{Chae-Degond-Liu}, the optimality in terms of the scaling property is achieved via the Besov space estimate.   The special property of the energy estimate in terms of \dot{B}^s_{2,1} norm is essential for this result.   Contrary to the usual MHD the global well-posedness in the 2\frac12 dimensional Hall-MHD is wide open.
