In a previous paper by the second author, we discussed a characterization of the microlocal singularities for solutions to Schr\"odinger equations with long range type perturbations, using solutions to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this paper we show that we may use Dollard type approximate solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation if the perturbation satisfies somewhat stronger conditions. As applications, we describe the propagation of microlocal singularities for e^{itH_0}e^{-itH} when the potential is asymptotically homogeneous as |x|\to\infty, where H is our Schr\"odinger operator, and H_0 is the free Schr\"odinger operator, i.e., H_0=-\frac12 \triangle. We show e^{itH_0}e^{-itH} shifts the wave front set if the potential V is asymptotically homogeneous of order 1, whereas e^{itH}e^{-itH_0} is smoothing if V is asymptotically homogenous of order \beta\in (1,3/2).
