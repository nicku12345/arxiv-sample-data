We study the evolution of the heat and of a free quantum particle (described by the Schr\"odinger equation) on two-dimensional manifolds endowed with the degenerate Riemannian metric ds^2=dx^2+|x|^{-2\alpha}d\theta^2, where x\in \mathbb R, \theta\in\mathbb T and the parameter \alpha\in\mathbb R. For \alpha\le-1 this metric describes cone-like manifolds (for \alpha=-1 it is a flat cone). For \alpha=0 it is a cylinder. For \alpha\ge 1 it is a Grushin-like metric. We show that the Laplace-Beltrami operator \Delta is essentially self-adjoint if and only if \alpha\notin(-3,1). In this case the only self-adjoint extension is the Friedrichs extension \Delta_F, that does not allow communication through the singular set \{x=0\} both for the heat and for a quantum particle. For \alpha\in(-3,-1] we show that for the Schr\"odinger equation only the average on \theta of the wave function can cross the singular set, while the solutions of the only Markovian extension of the heat equation (which indeed is \Delta_F) cannot. For \alpha\in(-1,1) we prove that there exists a canonical self-adjoint extension \Delta_B, called bridging extension, which is Markovian and allows the complete communication through the singularity (both of the heat and of a quantum particle). Also, we study the stochastic completeness (i.e., conservation of the L^1 norm for the heat equation) of the Markovian extensions \Delta_F and \Delta_B, proving that \Delta_F is stochastically complete at the singularity if and only if \alpha\le -1, while \Delta_B is always stochastically complete at the singularity.
