In this work we construct a family of entire bounded solution for the singulary perturbed Inhomogeneous Allen-Cahn Equation \ep^2\div\left(a(x)\nabla u\right)-a(x)F'(u)=0 in \R^2, where \ep\to 0. The nodal set of these solutions is close to a "nondegenerate" curve which is asymptotically two non paralell straight lines. Here F' is a double-well potential and a is a smooth positive function. We also provide example of curves and functions a where our result applies. This work is in connection with the results found by Z.Du and B.Lai, Z.Du and C.Gui, and F. Pacard and M. Ritore, in "Transition layers for an inhomogeneus Allen-Cahn equation in Riemannian Manifolds", "Interior layers for an inhomogeneous Allen-Cahn equation", "From the constant mean curvature hypersurfaces to the gradient theory of phase transitions" respectively, where they handle the compact case.
