Consideration here is a generalized \mu-type integrable equation, which can be regarded as a generalization to both the \mu-Camassa-Holm and modified \mu-Camassa-Holm equations. It is shown that the proposed equation is formally integrable with the Lax-pair and the bi-Hamiltonian structure and its scale limit is an integrable model of hydrodynamical systems describing short capillary-gravity waves. Local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the suitable Sobolev space is established by the viscosity method. Existence of peaked traveling-wave solutions and formation of singularities of solutions for the equation are investigated. It is found that the equation admits a single peaked soliton and multi-peakon solutions. The effects of varying \mu-Camassa-Holm and modified \mu-Camassa-Holm nonlocal nonlinearities on blow-up criteria and wave breaking are illustrated in detail. Our analysis relies on the method of characteristics and conserved quantities and is proceeded with a priori differential estimates.
