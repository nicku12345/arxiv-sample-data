In this paper, we consider the elliptic system \begin{equation*}   \left\{\begin{array}{ll}   -\Delta u=g(x,v)\,\, \textnormal{in}\Omega, & \hbox{}   -\Delta v=f(x,u)\,\,\textnormal{in}\Omega, & \hbox{} u=v=0\textnormal{on}\partial\Omega, & \hbox{}   \end{array}   \right. \end{equation*} where \Omega is a bounded smooth domain in \mathbb{R}^N, and f and g satisfy a general superquadratic condition. By using variational methods, we prove the existence of infinitely many solutions. Our argument relies on the application of a generalized variant fountain theorem for strongly indefinite functionals. Previous results in the topic are improved.
