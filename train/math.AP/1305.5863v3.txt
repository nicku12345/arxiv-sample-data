For the abelian self-dual Chern-Simons-Higgs model we address existence issues of periodic vortex configurations -- the so-called condensates-- of non-topological type as k \to 0, where k>0 is the Chern-Simons parameter. We provide a positive answer to the long-standing problem on the existence of non-topological condensates with magnetic field concentrated at some of the vortex points (as a sum of Dirac measures) as k \to 0, a question which is of definite physical interest.
