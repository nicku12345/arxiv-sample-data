In this paper we establish uniqueness criteria for positive radially symmetric finite energy solutions of semilinear elliptic systems of the form   \begin{align*}   \begin{aligned}   - \Delta u &= f(|x|,u,v)\quad\text{in}\R^n,   - \Delta v &= f(|x|,v,u)\quad\text{in}\R^n.   \end{aligned}   \end{align*}   As an application we consider the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger system   \begin{align*}   \begin{aligned}   - \Delta u + u &= u^{2q-1} + b u^{q-1}v^q\quad\text{in}\R^n,   - \Delta v + v &= v^{2q-1} + b v^{q-1}u^q \quad\text{in}\R^n.   \end{aligned}   \end{align*}   for b>0 and exponents q which satisfy 1<q<\infty in case n\in\{1,2\} and   1<q<\frac{n}{n-2} in case n\geq 3. Generalizing the results of Wei and Yao dealing with the case q=2 we find new sufficient conditions and necessary conditions on b,q,n such that precisely one positive solution exists. Our results dealing with the special case n=1 are optimal.
