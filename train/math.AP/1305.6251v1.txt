We obtain a new Liouville comparison principle for weak solutions (u,v) of semilinear parabolic second-order partial differential inequalities of the form u_t -{\mathcal L}u- |u|^{q-1}u\geq v_t -{\mathcal L}v- |v|^{q-1}v (*) in the whole space {\mathbb E} = {\mathbb R} \times \mathbb R^n. Here, n\geq 1, q>0 and  {\mathcal L}=\sum\limits_{i,j=1}^n\frac{\partial}{{\partial}x_i}\left [ a_{ij}(t, x) \frac{\partial}{{\partial}x_j}\right], where a_{ij}(t,x), i,j=1,\dots,n, are functions that are defined, measurable and locally bounded in \mathbb E, and such that a_{ij}(t,x)=a_{ji}(t,x) and  \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}(t,x)\xi_i\xi_j\geq 0  for almost all (t,x)\in \mathbb E and all \xi \in \mathbb R^n. We show that the critical exponents in the Liouville comparison principle obtained, which are responsible for the non-existence of non-trivial (i.e., such that u\not \equiv v) weak solutions to (*) in the whole space \mathbb E, depend on the behavior of the coefficients of the operator \mathcal L at infinity and coincide with those obtained for solutions of (*) in the half-space {\mathbb R}_+\times {\mathbb R}^n. As direct corollaries we obtain new Liouville-type theorems for non-negative weak solutions u of the inequality (*) in the whole space \mathbb E in the case when v\equiv 0. All the results obtained are new and sharp.
