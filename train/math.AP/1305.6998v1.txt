We examine the validity of the Poincar\'e inequality for degenerate, second-order, elliptic operators H in divergence form on L_2(\Ri^{n}\times\Ri^{m}). We assume the coefficients are real symmetric and a_1H_\delta\geq H\geq a_2H_\delta for some a_1,a_2>0 where H_\delta is a generalized Gru\v{s}in operator, \[ H_\delta=-\nabla_{x_1}\,|x_1|^{(2\delta_1,2\delta_1')}\,\nabla_{x_1}-|x_1|^{(2\delta_2,2\delta_2')}\,\nabla_{x_2}^2 \;. \] Here x_1\in\Ri^n, x_2\in\Ri^m, \delta_1,\delta_1'\in[0,1\rangle,   \delta_2,\delta_2'\geq0 and |x_1|^{(2\delta,2\delta')}=|x_1|^{2\delta} if |x_1|\leq 1 and |x_1|^{(2\delta,2\delta')}=|x_1|^{2\delta'} if |x_1|\geq 1.   \smallskip   We prove that the Poincar\'e inequality, formulated in terms of the Riemannian geometry corresponding to H, is valid if n\geq 2, or if n=1 and \delta_1\vee\delta_1'\in[0,1/2\rangle but it fails if n=1 and \delta_1\vee\delta_1'\in[1/2,1\rangle. The failure is caused by the leading term. If \delta_1\in[1/2, 1\rangle it is an effect of the local degeneracy |x_1|^{2\delta_1} but if \delta_1\in[0, 1/2\rangle and \delta_1'\in [1/2,1\rangle it is an effect of the growth at infinity of |x_1|^{2\delta_1'}.   If n=1 and \delta_1\in[1/2, 1\rangle then the semigroup S generated by the Friedrichs' extension of H is not ergodic. The subspaces x_1\geq 0 and x_1\leq 0 are S-invariant and the Poincar\'e inequality is valid on each of these subspaces. If, however, n=1, \delta_1\in[0, 1/2\rangle and \delta_1'\in [1/2,1\rangle then the semigroup S is ergodic but the Poincar\'e inequality is only valid locally.   \smallskip   Finally we discuss the implication of these results for the kernel of the semigroup S.
