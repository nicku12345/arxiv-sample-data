We analyze degenerate, second-order, elliptic operators H in divergence form on L_2(\Ri^{n}\times\Ri^{m}). We assume the coefficients are real symmetric and a_1H_\delta\geq H\geq a_2H_\delta for some a_1,a_2>0 where \[ H_\delta=-{\nabla}_{x_1}\cdot(c_{\delta_1, \delta'_1}(x_1)\,\nabla_{x_1})-c_{\delta_2, \delta'_2}(x_1)\,\nabla_{x_2}^2 \;. \] Here x_1\in\Ri^n, x_2\in\Ri^m and c_{\delta_i, \delta'_i} are positive measurable functions such that c_{\delta_i, \delta'_i}(x) behaves like |x|^{\delta_i} as x\to0 and |x|^{\delta_i'} as x\to\infty with \delta_1,\delta_1'\in[0,1\rangle and \delta_2,\delta_2'\geq0.   Our principal results state that the submarkovian semigroup S_t=e^{-tH} is conservative and its kernel K_t satisfies bounds \[ 0\leq K_t(x\,;y)\leq a\,(|B(x\,;t^{1/2})|\,|B(y\,;t^{1/2})|)^{-1/2} \] where |B(x\,;r)| denotes the volume of the ball B(x\,;r) centred at x with radius r measured with respect to the Riemannian distance associated with H. The proofs depend on detailed subelliptic estimations on H, a precise characterization of the Riemannian distance and the corresponding volumes and wave equation techniques which exploit the finite speed of propagation.   We discuss further implications of these bounds and give explicit examples that show the kernel is not necessarily strictly positive, nor continuous.
