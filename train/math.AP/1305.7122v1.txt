In this paper, we analyse the structure of the set of positive solutions of an heterogeneous nonlocal equation of the form:  \int_{\Omega} K(x, y)u(y)\,dy -\int_ {\Omega}K(y, x)u(x)\, dy + a_0u+\lambda a_1(x)u -\beta(x)u^p=0 \quad \text{in}\quad \times \O where \Omega\subset \R^n is a bounded open set, K\in C(\R^n\times \R^n)  is nonnegative, a_i,\beta \in C(\Omega) and \lambda\in\R. Such type of equation appears in some studies of population dynamics where the above solutions are the stationary states of the dynamic of a spatially structured population evolving in a heterogeneous partially controlled landscape and submitted to a long range dispersal. Under some fairly general assumptions on K,a_i and \beta we first establish a necessary and sufficient criterium for the existence of a unique positive solution. Then we analyse the structure of the set of positive solution (\lambda,u_\lambda) with respect to the presence or absence of a refuge zone (i.e \omega so that \beta_{|\omega}\equiv 0).
