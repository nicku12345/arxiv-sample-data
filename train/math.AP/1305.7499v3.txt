This note establishes an interior quantitative lower bound for nonnegative supersolutions of fully nonlinear uniformly parabolic equations. The result may be interpreted as a nonlinear, quantitative version of a growth lemma established by Krylov and Safonov for nonnegative supersolutions of linear uniformly parabolic equations in nondivergence form. Our approach is different, and follows from an application of the Fabes-Stroock estimate. The result is the parabolic analogue of an elliptic regularity estimate established by Caffarelli, Souganidis, and Wang in the stochastic homogenization of fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations.
