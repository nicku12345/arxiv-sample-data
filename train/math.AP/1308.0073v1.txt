We study Liouville theorems for the following polyharmonic H\'{e}non-Lane-Emden system \begin{eqnarray*}   \left\{\begin{array}{lcl} (-\Delta)^m u&=& |x|^{a}v^p \ \ \text{in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n,\\ (-\Delta)^m v&=& |x|^{b}u^q \ \ \text{in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n, \end{array}\right.   \end{eqnarray*} when m,p,q \ge 1, pq\neq1, a,b\ge0. The main conjecture states that (u,v)=(0,0) is the unique nonnegative solution of this system whenever (p,q) is {\it under} the critical Sobolev hyperbola, i.e.  \frac{n+a}{p+1}+\frac{n+b}{q+1}>{n-2m}. We show that this is indeed the case in dimension n=2m+1 for bounded solutions. In particular, when a=b and p=q, this means that u=0 is the only nonnegative bounded solution of the polyharmonic H\'{e}non equation   \begin{equation*}   (-\Delta)^m u= |x|^{a}u^p \ \ \text{in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^{n}   \end{equation*} in dimension n=2m+1 provided p is the subcritical Sobolev exponent, i.e., 1<p<{1+4m+2a}. Moreover, we show that the conjecture holds for radial solutions in any dimensions. It seems the power weight functions |x|^a and |x|^b make the problem dramatically more challenging when dealing with nonradial solutions.
