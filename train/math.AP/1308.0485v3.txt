We establish a spectral representation for solutions to linear Hamilton equations with positive definite energy in a Hilbert space. Our approach is a special version of M. Krein's spectral theory of J-selfadjoint operators is the Hilbert spaces with an indefinite metric. Our main result is an application to the eigenfunction expansion for the linearized relativistic Ginzburg-Landau equation.
