In this paper we study the problem   -\Delta u =\left(\frac{2+\alpha}{2}\right)^2\abs{x}^{\alpha}f(\lambda,u), & \hbox{in}B_1 \\ u > 0, & \hbox{in}B_1 u = 0, & \hbox{on} \partial B_1 where B_1 is the unit ball of \R^2, f is a smooth nonlinearity and \a, \l are real numbers with \a>0. From a careful study of the linearized operator we compute the Morse index of some radial solutions to \eqref{i0}. Moreover, using the bifurcation theory, we prove the existence of branches of nonradial solutions for suitable values of the positive parameter \l. The case f(\lambda,u)=\l e^u provides more detailed information.
