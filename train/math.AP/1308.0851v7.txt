This article is devoted to the study of the critical dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation in \mathbb{R}^2. For any initial data \theta_{0} belonging to the space \Lambda^{s} ( H^{s}_{uloc}(\mathbb{R}^2)) \cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2), we show that the critical (SQG) equation has at least one global weak solution in time for all 1/4\leq s \leq 1/2 and at least one local weak solution in time for all 0<s<1/4. The proof for the global existence is based on a new energy inequality which improves the one obtain in \cite{Laz} whereas the local existence uses more refined energy estimates based on Besov space techniques.
