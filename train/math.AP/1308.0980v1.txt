This paper is concerned with a special elliptic system, which can be seen as a perturbed p-Laplacean system, p\in(1,2), and, for its "shape", it is close to the p-Stokes system. Since our "stress tensor" is given by means of \nabla u  and not by its symmetric part, then our system is not a p-Stokes system. Hence, the system is called {\it modified} p-Stokes system. We look for the high regularity of the solutions (u,\pi), that is D^2u,\nabla\pi \in L^q,q\in(1,\infty). In particular, we get \nabla u,\pi\in C^{0,\alpha}. As far as we know, such a result of high regularity is the first concerning the coupling of unknowns (u,\pi). However, our result also holds for the p-Laplacean, and it is the first high regularity result in unbounded domains.
