Let q\geq 1+\frac{2}{N}. We prove that any positive solution of (E) \prt_t u-\xD u+u^q=0 in \mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty) admits an initial trace which is a nonnegative Borel measure, outer regular with respect to the fine topology associated to the Bessel capacity C_{\frac{2}{q},q'} in \BBR^N (q'=q/q-1)) and absolutely continuous with respect to this capacity. If \nu is a nonnegative Borel measure in \BBR^N with the above properties we construct a positive solution u of (E) with initial trace \gn and we prove that this solution is the unique \gs-moderate solution of (E) with such an initial trace. Finally we prove that every positive solution of (E) is \gs-moderate.
