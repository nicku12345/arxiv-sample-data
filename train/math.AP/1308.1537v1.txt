We establish a local minimality sufficiency criterion, based on the strict positivity of the second variation, in the context of a variational model for the epitaxial growth of elastic films. Our result holds also in the three-dimensional case and for a general class of nonlinear elastic energies. Applications to the study of the local minimality of flat morphologies are also shown.
