In this article we prove that for locally defined singular SU(n+1) Toda systems in R^2, the profile of fully bubbling solutions near the singular source can be accurately approximated by global solutions. The main ingredients of our new approach are the classification theorem of Lin-Wei-Ye and the non-degeneracy of the linearized Toda system, which make us overcome the difficulties that come from the lack of symmetry and the singular source.
