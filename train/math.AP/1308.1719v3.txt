In this paper we consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear wave equation (NLW) with quadratic derivative nonlinearities in two space dimensions. Following Gr\"{u}nrock's result in 3D, we take the data in the Fourier-Lebesgue spaces \^{H}_s^r, which coincide with the Sobolev spaces of the same regularity for r=2, but scale like lower regularity Sobolev spaces for 1<r<2. We show local well-posedness (LWP) for the range of exponents s>1+\frac{3}{2r}, 1<r\leq 2. On one end this recovers the sharp result on the Sobolev scale, H^{\frac{7}{4}+}, while on the other end establishes the \^{H}_{\frac{5}{2}}^{1+} result, which scales like the Sobolev H^{\frac{3}{2}+}, thus, corresponding to a \frac{1}{4} derivative improvement on the Sobolev scale.
