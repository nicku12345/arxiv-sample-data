We prove interpolation estimates between Morrey-Campanato spaces and Sobolev spaces. These estimates give in particular concentration-compactness inequalities in the translation-invariant and in the translation- and dilation-invariant case. They also give in particular interpolation estimates between Sobolev spaces and functions of bounded mean oscillation. The proofs rely on Sobolev integral representation formulae and maximal function theory. Fractional Sobolev spaces are also covered.
