We compute the Gabor matrix for Schr\"odinger-type evolution operators. Precisely, we analyze the Heat Equation, already presented in \cite{2012arXiv1209.0945C}, giving the exact expression of the Gabor matrix which leads to better numerical evaluations. Then, using asymptotic integration techniques, we obtain an upper bound for the Gabor matrix in one-dimension for the generalized Heat Equation, new in the literature. Using Maple software, we show numeric representations of the coefficients' decay. Finally, we show the super-exponential decay of the coefficients of the Gabor matrix for the Harmonic Repulsor, together with some numerical evaluations. This work is the natural prosecution of the ideas presented in \cite{2012arXiv1209.0945C} and \cite{MR2502369}.
