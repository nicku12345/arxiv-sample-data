We consider interacting particle systems and their mean-field limits, which are frequently used to model collective aggregation and are known to demonstrate a rich variety of pattern formations. The interaction is based on a pairwise potential combining short-range repulsion and long-range attraction. We study particular solutions, that are referred to as flocks in the second-order models, for the specific choice of the Quasi-Morse interaction potential. Our main result is a rigorous analysis of continuous, compactly supported flock profiles for the biologically relevant parameter regime. Existence and uniqueness is proven for three space dimension, whilst existence is shown for the two-dimensional case. Furthermore, we numerically investigate additional Morse-like interactions to complete the understanding of this class of potentials.
