We prove that the effective nonlinearities (ergodic constants) obtained in the stochastic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi, "viscous" Hamilton-Jacobi and nonlinear uniformly elliptic pde are approximated by the analogous quantities of appropriate "periodizations" of the equations. We also obtain an error estimate, when there is a rate of convergence for the stochastic homogenization.
