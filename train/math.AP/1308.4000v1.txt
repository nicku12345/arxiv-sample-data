In this paper we establish the uniformity property of a simplified Ericksen-Leslie system modelling the hydrodynamics of nematic liquid crystals on the two dimensional unit sphere S^2, namely the uniform convergence in L^2 to a steady state exponentially as t tends to infinity. The main assumption, similar to Topping [15], concerns the equation of liquid crystal director d and states that at infinity time, a weak limit d_\infty and any bubble \omega_i(1\le i\le l) share a common orientation. As consequences, the uniformity property holds under various types of small initial data.
