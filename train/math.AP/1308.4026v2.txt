In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of least energy solutions and the existence of multiple bubbling solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations involving the fractional Laplacians and the critical exponents. This work can be seen as a nonlocal analog of the results of Han (Ann. Inst. H. Poincare Anal. Non Lineaire, 1991) and Rey (J. Funct. Anal., 1990).
