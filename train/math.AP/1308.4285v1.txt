Recently, Candy and Bournaveas proved local well-posedness of the space-time monopole equation in Lorenz gauge for initial data in H^s  with s>\frac14. The equation is L^2-critical, and hence a \frac14 derivative gap is left between their result and the scaling prediction. In this paper, we consider initial data in the Fourier-Lebesgue space \hat{H_p^s} for 1<p\le 2 which coincides with H^s when p=2 but scales like lower regularity Sobolev spaces for 1<p< 2. In particular, we will see that as p\rightarrow 1^+, the critical exponent s^c_p\rightarrow 1^-, in which case \hat{\dot H_{1+}^{1-}} is the critical space. We shall prove almost optimal local well-posedness to the space-time monopole equation in Lorenz gauge with initial data in the aforementioned spaces that correspond to p close to 1.
