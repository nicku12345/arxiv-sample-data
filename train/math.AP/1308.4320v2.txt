We study the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation -\Delta u + V(x) u = g(x,u), where V and g are periodic in x. We assume that 0 is a right boundary point of the essential spectrum of -\Delta+V. The superlinear and subcritical term g satisfies a Nehari type monotonicity condition. We employ a Nehari manifold type technique in a strongly indefitnite setting and obtain the existence of a ground state solution. Moreover we get infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions provided that g is odd.
