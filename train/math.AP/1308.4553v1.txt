Since the works of Haraux and Jaffard we know that rectangular plates may be observed by subregions not satisfying the geometrical control condition. We improve these results by observing only on an arbitrarily short segment inside the domain. The estimates may be strengthened by observing on several well-chosen segments.   In the second part of the paper we establish various observability theorems for rectangular membranes by applying Mehrenberger's recent generalization of Ingham's theorem.
