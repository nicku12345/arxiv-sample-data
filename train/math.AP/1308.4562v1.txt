The aim of this work is to extend the results from [B2] on local eigenvalue spacings to certain 1D lattice Schrodinger with a Bernoulli potential. We assume the disorder satisfies a certain algebraic condition that enables one to invoke the recent results from [B1] on the regularity of the density of states. In particular we establish Poisson local eigenvalue statistics in those models
