In this paper, we show the global well-posedness for periodic gKdV equations in the space H^s(\mathbb{T}), s\ge \frac12 for quartic case, and s> \frac59 for quintic case. These improve the previous results of I-team in 2004. In particular, the result is sharp for quintic case. The main approaches are the I-method combining with the resonance decomposition developed by Miao et al in 2010, and a bilinear Strichartz estimate in periodic setting.
