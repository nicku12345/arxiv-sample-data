We study the large time behavior of solutions to a non-local diffusion equation, u_t=J*u-u with J smooth, radially symmetric and compactly supported, posed in \mathbb{R}_+ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. In sets of the form x\ge \xi t^{1/2}, \xi>0, the outer region, the asymptotic behavior is given by a multiple of the dipole solution for the local heat equation, and the solution is O(t^{-1}). The proportionality constant is determined from a conservation law, related to the asymptotic first momentum. On compact sets, the inner region, after scaling the solution by a factor t^{3/2}, it converges to a multiple of the unique stationary solution of the problem that behaves as x at infinity. The precise proportionality factor is obtained through a matching procedure with the outer behavior. Since the outer and the inner region do not overlap, the matching is quite involved. It has to be done for the scaled function t^{3/2}u(x,t)/x, which takes into account that different scales lead to different decay rates.
