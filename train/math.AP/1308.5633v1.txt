Time-periodic solutions to the linearized Navier-Stokes system in the n-dimensional whole-space are investigated. For time-periodic data in L^q-spaces, maximal regularity and corresponding a priori estimates for the associated time-periodic solutions are established. More specifically, a Banach space of time-periodic vector fields is identified with the property that the linearized Navier-Stokes operator maps this space homeomorphically onto the L^q-space of time-periodic data.
