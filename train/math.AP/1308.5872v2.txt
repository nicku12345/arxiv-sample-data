This paper concerns the reconstruction of a complex-valued anisotropic tensor \gamma=\sigma+\i\omega\varepsilon from knowledge of several internal magnetic fields H, where H satisfies the anisotropic Maxwell system on a bounded domain with prescribed boundary conditions. We show that \gamma can be uniquely reconstructed with a loss of two derivatives from errors in the acquisition of H. A minimum number of 6 such functionals is sufficient to obtain a local reconstruction of \gamma. In the special case where \gamma is close to a scalar tensor, boundary conditions are chosen by means of complex geometric optics (CGO) solutions. For arbitrary symmetric tensors \gamma, a Runge approximation property is used to obtain partial results. This problem finds applications in the medical imaging modalities Current Density Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography.
