Singular vorticty solutions of the incompressible 3D-Euler equation are constructed which satisfy the BKM criterion (cf. [2]). The construction is done by inviscid limits of vorticity solutions of transformed incompressible Navier Stokes type equations with a damping potential term, where the latter equations admit a global regular solution for positive viscosity. The inviscid limit vorticity solution of the incompressible Euler vorticity equation becomes singular at a point of the boundary of a finite domain.
