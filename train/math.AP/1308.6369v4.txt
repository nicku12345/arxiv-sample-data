We are concerned on the study of the unique continuation type property for the 3D incompressible Euler equations in the self-similar type form. Discretely self-similar solution is a generalized notion of the self-similar solution, which is equivalent to a time periodic solution of the time dependent self-similar Euler equations. We prove the unique continuation type theorem for the discretely self-similar solutions to the Euler equations in \Bbb R^3. More specifically, we suppose there exists an open set G\subset \Bbb R^3 containing the origin such that the velocity field V\in C_s^1C^{2}_y (\Bbb R^{3+1}) vanishes on G\times (0, S_0), where S_0 > 0 is the temporal period for V(y,s). Then, we show V(y,s)=0 for all (y,s)\in \Bbb R^{3+1}. Similar property also holds for the inviscid magnetohydrodynamic system
