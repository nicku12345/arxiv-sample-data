We consider the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equation in 2D in the Coulomb gauge. We establish local well-posedness for s=\frac 14+\epsilon for data for the spatial part of the gauge potentials and for s=\frac 58+\epsilon for the solution \phi of the gauged Klein-Gordon equation. The main tool for handling the wave equations is the product estimate established by D'Ancona, Foschi, and Selberg. Due to low regularity, we are unable to use the conventional approaches to handle the elliptic variable A_0, so we provide a new approach.
