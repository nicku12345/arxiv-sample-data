We study the existence of solutions to the fractional elliptic equation (E1) (-\Delta)^\alpha u+\epsilon g(|\nabla u|)=\nu  in a bounded regular domain \Omega of \R^N (N\ge2), subject to the condition (E2) u=0 in \Omega^c, where \epsilon=1 or -1, (-\Delta)^\alpha denotes the fractional Laplacian with \alpha\in(1/2,1), \nu is a Radon measure and g:\R_+\mapsto\R_+ is a continuous function. We prove the existence of weak solutions for problem (E1)-(E2) when g is subcritical. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior and uniqueness of solutions are described when \nu is Dirac mass, g(s)=s^p, p\geq 1 and \epsilon=1.
