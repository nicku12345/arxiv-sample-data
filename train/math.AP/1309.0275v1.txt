We prove the global existence of a helical weak solution of the 3D Euler equations, in full space, for an initial velocity with helical symmetry, without swirl and whose initial vorticity is compactly supported in the axial plane and belongs to L^p, for some p>\frac{4}{3}. This result is an extension of the existence part of the work of B. Ettinger and E. Titi (SIAM J. Math Anal. 41(2009) 269-296), who studied well-posedness of the Euler equations with helical symmetry without swirl, with bounded initial vorticity, in a helical pipe.
