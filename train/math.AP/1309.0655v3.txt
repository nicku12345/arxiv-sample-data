We describe the asymptotic behavior of small energy solutions of an NLS with a trapping potential. In particular we generalize work of Soffer and Weinstein, and of Tsai et. al. The novelty is that we allow generic spectra associated to the potential. This is yet a new application of the idea to interpret the nonlinear Fermi Golden Rule as a consequence of the Hamiltonian structure.
