We review the continuous theory of dislocations from a mathematical point of view using mathematical tools, which were only partly available when the theory was developed several decades ago. We define a space of dislocation measures, which includes Hausdorff measures representing the dislocation measures of single dislocation curves. The evolution equation for dislocation measures is defined on this space. It is derived from four basic conditions, which must be satisfied by the model.
