In this article we consider the nonlinear system involving the p-Laplacian \left\{\begin{array}{lc} |u^\prime |^{p-2} u^{\prime \prime} = u^{p-1} v^p& |v^\prime |^{p-2} v^{\prime \prime} = v^{p-1} u^p&\ {\rm on} \ \R, u\geq 0, v\geq 0& \end{array}\right. for which we prove symmetry, asymptotic behavior and non degeneracy properties. This can help to a better understanding to what happens in the N dimensional case, for which several authors prove a De Giorgi Type result under some additional growth and monotonicity assumptions.
