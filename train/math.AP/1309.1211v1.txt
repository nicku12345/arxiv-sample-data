This paper is concerned with pullback attractors of the stochastic p-Laplace equation defined on the entire space R^n. We first establish the asymptotic compactness of the equation in L^2(R^n) and then prove the existence and uniqueness of non-autonomous random attractors. This attractor is pathwise periodic if the non-autonomous deterministic forcing is time periodic. The difficulty of non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings on R^n is overcome by the uniform smallness of solutions outside a bounded domain.
