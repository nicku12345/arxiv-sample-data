It is proved in Chon{\'e} and Le Meur (2001) that the problem of minimizing a Dirichlet-like functional of the function u\_h discretized with P\_1 Finite Elements, under the constraint that u\_h be convex, cannot converge. Here, we first improve this result by proving that non-convergence is due to the mesh refinment lack of richness, remains local and is true even for any mesh. Then, we investigate the consistency of various natural discretizations (P\_1 and P\_2) of second order constraints (subharmonicity and convexity) without discussing the convergence. We also numerically illustrate convergence of a method proposed in the literature that is simpler than existing methods.
