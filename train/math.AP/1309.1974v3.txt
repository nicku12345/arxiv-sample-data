The classical sharp Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality states that, for 1<p, t<\infty and 0<\lambda=n-\alpha <n with  1/p +1 /t+ \lambda /n=2, there is a best constant N(n,\lambda,p)>0, such that  |\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)|x-y|^{-\lambda} g(y) dx dy|\le N(n,\lambda,p)||f||_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}||g||_{L^t(\mathbb{R}^n)}  holds for all f\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n), g\in L^t(\mathbb{R}^n). The sharp form is due to Lieb, who proved the existence of the extremal functions to the inequality with sharp constant, and computed the best constant in the case of p=t (or one of them is 2). Except that the case for p\in ((n-1)/n, n/\alpha) (thus \alpha may be greater than n) was considered by Stein and Weiss in 1960, there is no other result for \alpha>n. In this paper, we prove that the reversed Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for 0<p, t<1, \lambda<0 holds for all nonnegative f\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n), g\in L^t(\mathbb{R}^n). For p=t, the existence of extremal functions is proved, all extremal functions are classified via the method of moving sphere, and the best constant is computed.
