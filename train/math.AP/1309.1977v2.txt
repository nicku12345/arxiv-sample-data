We demonstrate null structure in the Yang-Mills equations in Lorenz gauge. Such structure was found in Coulomb gauge by Klainerman and Machedon, who used it to prove global well-posedness for finite-energy data. Compared with Coulomb gauge, Lorenz gauge has the advantage---shared with the temporal gauge---that it can be imposed globally in space even for large solutions. Using the null structure and bilinear space-time estimates, we also prove local-in-time well-posedness of the equations in Lorenz gauge, for data with finite energy. The time of existence depends on the initial energy and on the H^s \times H^{s-1}-norm of the initial potential, for some s < 1.
