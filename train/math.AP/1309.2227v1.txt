In this paper we obtain a Harnack type inequality for solutions to elliptic equations in divergence form with non-standard p(x)-type growth. A model equation is the inhomogeneous p(x)-laplacian. Namely, \[ \Delta_{p(x)}u:=\mbox{div}\big(|\nabla u|^{p(x)-2}\nabla u\big)=f(x)\quad\mbox{in}\quad\Omega \] for which we prove Harnack inequality when f\in L^{q_0}(\Omega) if \max\{1,\frac N{p_{min}}\}<q_0\le \infty. The constant in Harnack inequality depends on u only through \||u|^{p(x)}\|_{L^1(\Omega)}^{p_{max}-p_{min}}. Dependence of the constant on u is known to be necessary in the case of variable p(x). As in previous papers, log-H\"older continuity on the exponent p(x) is assumed.   We also prove that weak solutions are locally bounded and H\"older continuous when f\in L^{q_0(x)}(\Omega) with q_0\in C(\Omega) and \max\{1,\frac N{p(x)}\}<q_0(x) in \Omega.   These results are then generalized to elliptic equations \[ \mbox{div}A(x,u,\nabla u)=B(x,u,\nabla u) \] with p(x)-type growth.
