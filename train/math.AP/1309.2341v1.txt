There are at least two directions concerning the extension of classical sharp Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality: (1) Extending the sharp inequality on general manifolds; (2) Extending it for the negative exponent \lambda=n-\alpha (that is for the case of \alpha>n). In this paper we confirm the possibility for the extension along the first direction by establishing the sharp Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the upper half space (which is conformally equivalent to a ball). The existences of extremal functions are obtained; And for certain range of the exponent, we classify all extremal functions via the method of moving sphere.
