In this article we study global existence and blow-up of solutions for a general class of nonlocal nonlinear wave equations with power-type nonlinearities, u_{tt}-Lu_{xx}=B(- |u|^{p-1}u)_{xx}, ~(p>1), where the nonlocality enters through two pseudo-differential operators L and B. We establish thresholds for global existence versus blow-up using the potential well method which relies essentially on the ideas suggested by Payne and Sattinger. Our results improve the global existence and blow-up results given in the literature for the present class of nonlocal nonlinear wave equations and cover those given for many well-known nonlinear dispersive wave equations such as the so-called double-dispersion equation and the traditional Boussinesq-type equations, as special cases.
