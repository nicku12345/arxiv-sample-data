The purpose of this note is to present a spatially localized L \log L bound on the vorticity in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, assuming a very mild, \emph{purely geometric} condition. This yields an extra-log decay of the distribution function of the vorticity, which in turn implies \emph{breaking the criticality} in a physically, numerically, and mathematical analysis-motivated blow-up scenario based on vortex stretching and anisotropic diffusion.
