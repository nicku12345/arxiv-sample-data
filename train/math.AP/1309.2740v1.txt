For hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one space dimension with a mathematical entropy, we define the notion of entropy velocity. Then we give sufficient conditions for such a system to be covariant under the action of a group of space-time transformations. These conditions naturally introduce a representation of the group in the space of states. We construct such hyperbolic system from the knowledge of data on the manifold of null velocity. We apply these ideas for Galileo, Lorentz and circular groups. We focus on particular non trivial examples for two of two systems of conservation laws.
