We derive some bounds which can be viewed as an evidence of increasing stability in the problem of recovering the potential coefficient in the Schr\"odinger equation from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map in the presence of attenuation, when energy level/frequency is growing. These bounds hold under certain a-priori regularity constraints on the unknown coefficient. Proofs use complex and bounded complex geometrical optics solutions.
