We study the existence of solutions u:\R^{3}\to\R^{2} for the semilinear elliptic systems \begin{equation}\label{eq:abs} -\Delta u(x,y,z)+\nabla W(u(x,y,z))=0, \end{equation} where W:\R^{2}\to\R is a double well symmetric potential. We use variational methods to show, under generic non degenerate properties of the set of one dimensional heteroclinic connections between the two minima \a_{\pm} of W, that (\ref{eq:abs}) has infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions u\in C^{2}(\R^{3},\R^{2}) which satisfy u(x,y,z)\to \a_{\pm} as {x\to\pm\infty} uniformly with respect to (y,z)\in\R^{2} and which exhibit dihedral symmetries with respect to the variables y and z. We also characterize the asymptotic behaviour of these solutions as |(y,z)|\to +\infty.
