It is shown in this paper that suitable weak solutions to the 6D steady incompressible Navier-Stokes and MHD equations are H\"older continuous near boundary provided that either r^{-3}\int_{B_r^+}|u(x)|^3dx or r^{-2}\int_{B_r^+}|\nabla u(x)|^2dx is sufficiently small, which implies that the 2D Hausdorff measure of the set of singular points near the boundary is zero. This generalizes recent interior regularity results by Dong-Strain \cite{DS}.
