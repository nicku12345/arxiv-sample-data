For a parabolic equation associated to a uniformly elliptic operator, we obtain a W^{3, \varepsilon} estimate, which provides a lower bound on the Lebesgue measure of the set on which a viscosity solution has a quadratic expansion. The argument combines parabolic W^{2,\varepsilon} estimates with a comparison principle argument. As an application, we show, assuming the operator is C^1, that a viscosity solution is C^{2,\alpha} on the complement of a closed set of Hausdorff dimension \varepsilon less than that of the ambient space, where the constant \varepsilon>0 depends only on the dimension and the ellipticity.
