We analyze the factorization method (introduced by Kirsch in 1998 to solve inverse scattering problems at fixed frequency from the far field operator) for a general class of boundary conditions that generalizes impedance boundary conditions. For instance, when the surface impedance operator is of pseudo-differential type, our main result stipulates that the factorization method works if the order of this operator is different from one and the operator is Fredholm of index zero with non negative imaginary part. We also provide some validating numerical examples for boundary operators of second order with discussion on the choice of the test function.
