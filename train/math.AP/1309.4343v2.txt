We obtain an error estimate between viscosity solutions and \delta-viscosity solutions of nonhomogeneous fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations. The main assumption, besides uniform ellipticity, is that the nonlinearity is Lipschitz-continuous in space with linear growth in the Hessian. We also establish a rate of convergence for monotone and consistent finite difference approximation schemes for such equations.
