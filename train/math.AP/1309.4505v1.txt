We consider the long time behavior of weak and strong solutions of the n-dimensional viscous Boussinesq system in the half space, with n\geq3 . The L^r(R^n_+)-asymptotics of strong solutions and their first three derivatives, with 1\leq r\leq\infty, are derived combining L^q-L^r estimates and properties of the fractional powers of the Stokes operator. For the L^\infty-asymptotics of the second order derivatives the unboundedness of the projection operator P: L^\infty(R^n_+)\rightarrow L^\infty_\sigma(R^n_+) is dealt by an appropriate decomposition of the nonlinear term.
