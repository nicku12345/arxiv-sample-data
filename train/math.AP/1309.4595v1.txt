We study the asymptotic properties of the semigroup S(t) arising from a nonlinear viscoelastic equation with hereditary memory on a bounded three-dimensional domain written in the past history framework of Dafermos. We establish the existence of the global attractor of optimal regularity for S(t) for a wide class of nonlinearities as well as within the most general condition on the memory kernel.
