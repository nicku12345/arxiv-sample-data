Using variational methods combined with perturbation arguments, we study the existence of nontrivial classical solution for the quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation   \begin{equation*}\label{1.1}   -\Delta u+ V(x)u+ \frac{\kappa}{2}[\Delta |u|^2]u=l(u),\ x\in\mathbb{R}^N,   \end{equation*} where V:\mathbb{R}^N\rightarrow \mathbb{R} and l:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} are continuous function, \kappa is a parameter and N\geq 3. This model has been proposed in plasma physics and nonlinear optics. As a main novelty with respect to some previous results, we are able to deal with the case \kappa>0.
