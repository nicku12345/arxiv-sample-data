We consider self-similar solutions to Smoluchowski's coagulation equation for kernels K=K(x,y) that are homogeneous of degree zero and close to constant in the sense that \[   -\eps \leq K(x,y)-2 \leq \eps \Big(\Big(\frac{x}{y}\Big)^{\alpha} + \Big(\frac{y}{x}\Big)^{\alpha}\Big) \] for \alpha \in [0,1). We prove that self-similar solutions with given mass are unique if \eps is sufficiently small which is the first such uniqueness result for kernels that are not solvable. Our proof relies on a contraction argument in a norm that measures the distance of solutions with respect to the weak topology of measures.
