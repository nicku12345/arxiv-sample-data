We propose a global scheme for the incompressible Navier Stokes equation, where at each time step a damping potential term is introduced via a time dilation transformation of the equation itself. This leads a global upper bounds of the value function and its spatial derivatives. The regularity is limited only by the regularity of the viscosity coefficient function and by the regularity and polynomial decay of the data. On an analytical level the scheme proposed is an alternative to schemes with external control functions.
