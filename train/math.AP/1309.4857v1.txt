In this paper, we examine the boundary L^2 term of the sharp Sobolev trace inequality \|u\|_{L^{q}(\pa M)}^2\leq S \|\nabla_g u\|_{L^2(M)}^2 +A(M,g)\|u\|^2_{L^2(\pa M)} on Riemannian manifolds (M,g) with boundaries \pa M, where q=\frac{2(n-1)}{n-2}, S is the best constant and A(M,g) is some positive constant depending only on M and g. We obtain a sharp trace inequality involving the mean curvature in a remainder term, which would fail in general once the mean curvature is replaced by any smaller function.
