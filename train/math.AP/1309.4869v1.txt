Let u_{g} the unique solution of a parabolic variational inequality of second kind, with a given g. Using a regularization method, we prove, for all g_{1} and g_{2}, a monotony property between \mu u_{g_{1}} + (1-\mu)u_{g_{2}} and u_{\mu g_{1} + (1-\mu)g_{2}} for \mu \in [0, 1]. This allowed us to prove the existence and uniqueness results to a family of optimal control problems over g for each heat transfer coefficient h>0, associated to the Newton law, and of another optimal control problem associated to a Dirichlet boundary condition. We prove also, when h\to +\infty, the strong convergence of the optimal controls and states associated to this family of optimal control problems with the Newton law to that of the optimal control problem associated to a Dirichlet boundary condition.
