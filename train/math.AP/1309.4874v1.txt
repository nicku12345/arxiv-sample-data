We consider a family of optimal control problems where the control variable is given by a boundary condition of Neumann type. This family is governed by parabolic variational inequalities of the second kind. We prove the strong convergence of the optimal controls and state systems associated to this family to a similar optimal control problem. This work solves the open problem left by the authors in IFIP TC7 CSMO2011.
