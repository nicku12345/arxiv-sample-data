The possibility of finite-time, dispersive blow up for nonlinear equations of Schroedinger type is revisited. This mathematical phenomena is one of the possible explanations for oceanic and optical rogue waves. In dimension one, the possibility of dispersive blow up for nonlinear Schroedinger equations already appears in [9]. In the present work, the existing results are extended in several ways. In one direction, the theory is broadened to include the Davey-Stewartson and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. In another, dispersive blow up is shown to obtain for nonlinear Schroedinger equations in spatial dimensions larger than one and for more general power-law nonlinearities. As a by-product of our analysis, a sharp global smoothing estimate for the integral term appearing in Duhamel's formula is obtained.
