We are concerned with a family of dissipative active scalar equation with velocity fields coupled via multiplier operators that can be of high-order. We consider sub-critical values for the fractional diffusion and prove global well-posedness of solutions with small initial data belonging to a framework based on Fourier transform, namely Fourier-Besov-Morrey spaces. Since the smallness condition is with respect to the weak norm of this space, some initial data with large L^{2}-norm can be considered. Self-similar solutions are obtained depending on the homogeneity of the initial data and couplings. Also, we show that solutions are asymptotically self-similar at infinity. Our results can be applied in a unified way for a number of active scalar PDEs like 1D models on dislocation dynamics in crystals, Burguer's equations, 2D vorticity equation, 2D generalized SQG, 3D magneto geostrophic equations, among others.
