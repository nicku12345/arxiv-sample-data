The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation describes magnetization dynamics in the presence of an applied field and a spin polarized current. In the case of axial symmetry and with focus on one space dimension, we investigate the emergence of space-time patterns in the form of wavetrains and coherent structures, whose local wavenumber varies in space. A major part of this study concerns existence and stability of wavetrains and of front- and domain wall-type coherent structures whose profiles asymptote to wavetrains or the constant up-/down-magnetizations. For certain polarization the Slonczewski term can be removed which allows for a more complete charaterization, including soliton-type solutions. Decisive for the solution structure is the polarization parameter as well as size of anisotropy compared with the difference of field intensity and current intensity normalized by the damping.
