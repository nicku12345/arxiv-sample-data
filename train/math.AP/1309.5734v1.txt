In this paper, we study approximate cloaking for the Helmholtz equation in 3d where the cloaking device is based on transformations which blow up a cylinder of fixed height and small cross section of radius \eps into the cloaked region. Assuming the zero Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on the boundary of the cloaked region, we show that the degree of visibility is of order \eps as \eps goes to 0. This fact is quite surprising since it is known that the degree of visibility, for the scheme using transformations which blow up a small region of diameter \eps into the cloaked region, is of order \eps in 3d and 1/ |\ln \eps| in 2d. To understand the relation between these contexts, we as well revisit the known estimates and show that the degree of visibility is of order \eps^{d-1} (d=2,3) for the scheme using transformations which blow up a small {\it ball} of diameter \eps into the cloaked region as long as the zero Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on the boundary of the cloaked region. The symmetry of the cross section and of the ball are crucial so that these results hold.
