In the present note, we give a concise proof for the equivalence between the local boundedness property for parabolic Dirichlet BVP's and the gaussian upper bound for their Green functions. The parabolic equations we consider are of general divergence form and our proof is essentially based on the gaussian upper bound by Daners \cite{Da} and a Caccioppoli's type inequality. We also show how the same analysis enables us to get a weaker version of the local boundedness property for parabolic Neumann BVP's assuming that the corresponding Green functions satisfy a gaussian upper bound.
