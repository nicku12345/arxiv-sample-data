The dissipative wave equation with a critical quintic nonlinearity in smooth bounded three dimensional domain is considered. Based on the recent extension of the Strichartz estimates to the case of bounded domains, the existence of a compact global attractor for the solution semigroup of this equation is established. Moreover, the smoothness of the obtained attractor is also shown.
