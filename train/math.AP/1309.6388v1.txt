A global solvability result of the Cauchy problem of the two-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system near a given global Maxwellian is established by employing an approach different than that of [5]. Compared with that of [5], the minimal regularity index and the smallness assumptions we imposed on the initial data are weaker. Our analysis does not rely on the decay of the corresponding linearized system and the Duhamel principle and thus it can be used to treat the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system for the case of \gamma>-3 and the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system for the case of -1<\gamma\leq 1 to deduce the global existence results together with the corresponding temporal decay estimates.
