The blowup is studied for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation iu_{t}+\Delta u+ |u|^{p-1}u=0 with p is odd and p\ge 1+\frac 4{N-2} (the energy-critical or energy-supercritical case). It is shown that the solution with negative energy E(u_0)<0 blows up in finite or infinite time. A new proof is also presented for the previous result in \cite{HoRo2}, in which a similar result but more general in a case of energy-subcritical was shown.
