For all functions on an arbitrary open set \Omega\subset\R^3 with zero boundary values, we prove the optimal bound \[ \sup_{\Omega}|u| \leq (2\pi)^{-1/2} \left(\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^2 \,dx\, \int_{\Omega}|\Delta u|^2 \,dx\right)^{1/4}. \] The method of proof is elementary and admits generalizations. The inequality is applied to establish an existence theorem for the Burgers equation.
