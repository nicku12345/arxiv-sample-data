We consider the Einstein/Yang-Mills equations in 3+1 space time dimensions with \SU(2) gauge group and prove rigorously the existence of a globally defined smooth static solution. We show that the associated Einstein metric is asymptotically flat and the total mass is finite. Thus, for non-abelian gauge fields the Yang/Mills repulsive force can balance the gravitational attractive force and prevent the formation of singularities in spacetime.
