The question of complete integrability of evolution equations associated to n\times n first order isospectral operators is investigated using the inverse scattering method. It is shown that for n>2, e.g. for the three-wave interaction, additional (nonlinear) pointwise flows are necessary for the assertion of complete integrability. Their existence is demonstrated by constructing action-angle variables. This construction depends on the analysis of a natural 2-form and symplectic foliation for the groups GL(n) and SU(n).}
