Monge-Amp\`ere equations of the form, u_{xx}u_{yy}-u_{xy}^2=F(u,u_x,u_y) arise in many areas of fluid and solid mechanics. Here it is shown that in the special case F=u_y^4f(u, u_x/u_y), where f denotes an arbitrary function, the Monge-Amp\`ere equation can be linearized by using a sequence of Amp\`ere, point, Legendre and rotation transformations. This linearization is a generalization of three examples from finite elasticity, involving plane strain and plane stress deformations of the incompressible perfectly elastic Varga material and also relates to a previous linearization of this equation due to Khabirov [7].
