The x-dependence of the symmetries of (1+1)-dimensional scalar translationally invariant evolution equations is described. The sufficient condition of (quasi)polynomiality in time t of the symmetries of evolution equations with constant separant is found. The general form of time dependence of the symmetries of KdV-like non-linearizable evolution equations is presented.
