This paper deals with the limit behaviour of the solutions of quasi-linear equations of the form \ \ds -\limfunc{div}\left(a\left(x, x/{\varepsilon _h},Du_h\right)\right)=f_h on \Omega  with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The sequence (\varepsilon _h) tends to 0 and the map a(x,y,\xi ) is periodic in y, monotone in \xi  and satisfies suitable continuity conditions. It is proved that u_h\rightarrow u weakly in H_0^{1,2}(\Omega ), where u is the solution of a homogenized problem \ -\limfunc{div}(b(x,Du))=f on \Omega . We also prove some corrector results, i.e. we find (P_h) such that Du_h-P_h(Du)\rightarrow 0 in L^2(\Omega ,R^n).
