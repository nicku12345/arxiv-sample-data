For the quasilinear wave equation   \partial_t^2u - \Delta u = u_t u_{tt},   we analyze the long-time behavior of classical solutions with small (not rotationally invariant) data. We give a complete asymptotic expansion of the lifespan and describe the solution close to the blowup point. It turns out that this solution is a ``blowup solution of cusp type,'' according to the terminology of the author.
