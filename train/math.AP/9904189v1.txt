A concept of semiclassically concentrated solutions is formulated for the multidimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) with an external field. These solutions are considered as multidimensional solitary waves. The center of mass of such a solution is shown to move along with the bicharacteristics of the basic symbol of the corresponding linear Schr\"odinger equation. The leading term of the asymptotic WKB-solution is constructed for the multidimensional NLSE. Special cases are considered for the standard one-dimensional NLSE and for NLSE in cylindrical coordinates.
