By studying braid group actions on Milnor's construction of the 1-sphere, we show that the general higher homotopy group of the 3-sphere is the fixed set of the pure braid group action on certain combinatorially described group. We also give certain representation of higher differentials in the Adams spectral sequence for the homotopy groups of the 2-sphere.
