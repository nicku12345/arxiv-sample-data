A smooth closed 3-manifold M fibered by tori T^2 is characterized by an element \phi \in GL(2,\mathbb{Z}). We show that M is the boundary of a 4-manifold fibered by tori over a surface such that the bundle structure on M is the restriction of the bundle structure on the 4-manifold if and only if \phi is from the commutator subgroup (GL(2,\mathbb{Z}))'. The notions of oriented and unoriented cobordisms in the class of closed 3-manifolds fibered by tori are introduced. It turns out that in this case the cobordisms form a group, namely \mathbb{Z}_{12} in the oriented case and \mathbb{Z}_{2}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{2} in the unoriented one. When the surface on the base of oriented cobordism is orientable, it is shown that its minimal genus can be calculated by Culler's algorithm.
