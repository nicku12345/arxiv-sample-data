We characterize ring spectra morphisms from the algebraic cobordism spectrum \QTR{Bbb}{MGL} (\QCITE{cite}{}{Vo1}) to an oriented spectrum \QTR{Bbb}{E} (in the sense of Morel \QCITE{cite}{}{Mo}) via formal group laws on the ''topological'' subring E^{*}=\oplus_iE^{2i,i} of E^{**}. This result is then used to construct for any prime p a motivic Quillen idempotent on \QTR{Bbb}{MGL}_{(p)}. This defines the BP-spectrum associated to the prime p as in Quillen's \QCITE{cite}{}{Q1} for the complex-oriented topological case.
