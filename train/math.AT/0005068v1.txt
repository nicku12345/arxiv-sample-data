Suppose G is a compact Lie group and N is a closed normal subgroup of G acting freely on a smooth manifold X. The Cartan theorem alluded to in the title postulates the existence of a natural isomorphism between the G-equivariant cohomology X and the G/N-equivariant cohomology of X/N.   In this note we use J. Kalkman's explicit isomorphism between the Cartan and Weil models of equivariant cohomology to show that 1) Cartan's theorem is a simple consequence of Chern-Weil's transgression formula and 2) explicitly describe this isomorphism at the cochain level.
