In this paper we study various simplicial complexes associated to the commutative structure of a finite group G. We define NC(G) (resp. C(G)) as the complex associated to the poset of pairwise non-commuting (resp. commuting) sets in G.   We observe that NC(G) has only one positive dimensional connected component, which we call BNC(G), and we prove that BNC(G) is simply connected.   Our main result is a simplicial decomposition formula for BNC(G) which follows from a result of A. Bjorner, M. Wachs and V. Welker on inflated simplicial complexes. As a corollary, we obtain that if G has a nontrivial center or if G has odd order, then the homology group H_{n-1}(BNC(G)) is nontrivial for every n such that G has a maximal noncommuting set of order n.
