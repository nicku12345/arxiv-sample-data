We describe some recent development on the theory of formal Frobenius manifolds via a construction from differential Gerstenhaber-Batalin-Vilkovisk (DGBV) algebras and formulate a version of mirror symmetry conjecture: the extended deformation problems of the complex structure and the Poisson structure are described by two DGBV algebras; mirror symmetry is interpreted in term of the invariance of the formal Frobenius manifold structures under quasi-isomorphism.
