The singular chain complex of the iterated loop space is expressed in terms of the cobar construction. After that we consider the spectral sequence of the cobar construction and calculate its first term over Z/p-coefficients and over a field of characteristic zero. Finally we apply these results to calculate the homology of the iterated loop spaces of the stunted real and complex projective spaces. In the Appendix, written by F.Sergeraert there are considered computer methods for calculations of the homology of iterated loop spaces.
