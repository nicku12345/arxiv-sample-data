We set up a framework for using algebraic geometry to study the generalised cohomology rings that occur in algebraic topology. This idea was probably first introduced by Quillen and it underlies much of our understanding of complex oriented cohomology theories, exemplified by the work of Morava. Most of the results have close and well-known analogues in the algebro-geometric literature, but with different definitions or technical assumptions that are often inconvenient for topological applications. We merely put everything together in a systematic and convenient way.
