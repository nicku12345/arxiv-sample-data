We consider four categories: the category of diagrams of small categories indexed by a given small category O, the (comma) category of small categories over O, the category of diagrams of simplicial sets indexed by O, and the category of simplicial sets over the nerve of O. Fritsch and Golasinski claimed that these four categories have equivalent homotopy categories but, in fact, their proof contains an error and the homotopy categories are not equivalent with the weak equivalences they use in the comma categories. We show here that the correct weak equivalences are the ``weak fibre homotopy equivalences'' defined by Latch. We also construct a model category structure on the category of simplicial sets over NO in which the weak equivalences are the weak fibre homotopy equivalences.
