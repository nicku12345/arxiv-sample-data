The Bass-Heller-Swan-Farrell-Hsiang-Siebenmann decomposition of the Whitehead group K_1(A_{\rho}[z,z^{-1}]) of a twisted Laurent polynomial extension A_{\rho}[z,z^{-1}] of a ring A is generalized to a decomposition of the Whitehead group K_1(A_{\rho}((z))) of a twisted Novikov ring of power series A_{\rho}((z))=A_{\rho}[[z]][z^{-1}]. The decomposition involves a summand W_1(A,\rho) which is an abelian quotient of the multiplicative group W(A,\rho) of Witt vectors 1+a_1z+a_2z^2+... \in A_{\rho}[[z]]. An example is constructed to show that in general the natural surjection W(A,\rho)^{ab} \to W_1(A,\rho) is not an isomorphism.
