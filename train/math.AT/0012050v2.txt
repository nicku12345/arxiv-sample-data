Let N be an o-minimal expansion of a real closed field. We develop cohomology theory for the category of N-definable manifolds and N-definable maps, and use this to solve the Peterzil-Steinhorn problem on the existence of torsion points on N-definably compact N-definable abelian groups. We compute the cohomology rings of N-definably compact N-definable groups, and we prove an o-minimal analog of the Poincare duality theorem, the Alexander dualti theorem, the Lefschetz duality theorem and the Lefschetz fixed point theorem.
