It is one of the most important facts in 4-dimensional topology that not every spherical homology class of a 4-manifold can be represented by an embedded sphere. In 1978, M. Freedman and R. Kirby showed that in the simply connected case, many of the obstructions to constructing such a sphere vanish if one modifies the ambient 4-manifold by adding products of 2-spheres, a process which is usually called stabilisation. In this paper, we extend this result to non-simply connected 4-manifolds and show how it is related to the Spin^c-bordism groups of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces.
