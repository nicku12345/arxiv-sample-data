We factor the virtual Poincare polynomial of every homogeneous space G/H, where G is a complex connected linear algebraic group and H is an algebraic subgroup, as t^{2u} (t^2-1)^r Q_{G/H}(t^2) for a polynomial Q_{G/H} with non-negative integer coefficients. Moreover, we show that Q_{G/H}(t^2) divides the virtual Poincar\'e polynomial of every regular embedding of G/H, if H is connected.
