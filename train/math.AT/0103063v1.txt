We show that for smooth complex projective varieties the most general combinations of chern numbers that are invariant under the K-equivalence relation consist of the complex elliptic genera. Combined with a recent result of Totaro, we deduce that up to complex cobordism any K-equivalence can be decomposed into a sequence of classical flops.
