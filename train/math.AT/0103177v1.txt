We introduce the notion of generalized orbifold Euler characteristic associated to an arbitrary group, and study its properties. We then calculate generating functions of higher order (p-primary) orbifold Euler characteristic of symmetric products of a G-manifold M. As a corollary, we obtain a formula for the number of conjugacy classes of d-tuples of mutually commuting elements (of order powers of p) in the wreath product G wreath S_n in terms of corresponding numbers of G. As a topological application, we present generating functions of Euler characteristic of equivariant Morava K-theories of symmetric products of a G-manifold M.
