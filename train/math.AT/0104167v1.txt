The aim of this paper is to prove the following result. For any commutative formal group {\frak F}(x\otimes 1,1\otimes x), which is considered as a formal group over H_\mathbb{Q}, there exists a homomorphism to a formal group of the form {\frak c}+x\otimes 1+1\otimes x, where \frak c\in H_\mathbb{Q}{\mathop{\hat{\otimes}} \limits_{R_\mathbb{Q}}}H_\mathbb{Q} such that (\id \otimes \epsilon){\frak c}=0= (\epsilon \otimes \id){\frak c}.
