In this paper we examine certain filtrations of topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic homology. As an example we show how the filtration with respect to a nilpotent ideal gives rise to an analog of a theorem of Goodwillie saying that rationally relative K-theory and relative cyclic homology agree. Our variation says that the p-torsion parts agree in a range of degrees. We use it to compute K_i(Z/p^m) for i < p-2.
