Let M be a Spin-manifold with S^1-action and let \sigma \in S^1 be of finite order. We show that the indices of certain twisted Dirac operators vanish if the action of \sigma  has sufficiently large fixed point codimension. These indices occur in the Fourier expansion of the elliptic genus of M in one of its cusps. As a by-product we obtain a new proof of a theorem of Hirzebruch and Slodowy on involutions.
