This is a revision of a paper first posted June 4, 2001. It will appear in the Journal of the AMS.   In this paper we construct a small E_\infty chain operad \S which acts naturally on the normalized cochains S^*X of a topological space. We also construct, for each n, a suboperad \S_n which is quasi-isomorphic to the normalized singular chains of the little n-cubes operad. The case n=2 leads to a substantial simplification of our earlier proof of Deligne's Hochschild cohomology conjecture.
