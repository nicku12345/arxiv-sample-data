Salikhov has proved a conjecture of Kontsevich and Shoikhet by reducing it to the consideration of three families of graphs, a consideration which was left to the reader for two of those families. We show, that the conjecture is just a very particular case of the classical theorem on the Euler characteristic, well explicated by Teleman.
