It is shown that only countably many spaces in the genus of \hpinfty, the infinite quaternionic projective space, can admit essential maps from \cpinfty, the infinite complex projective space. Examples of countably many homotopically distinct spaces in the genus of \hpinfty which admit essential maps from \cpinfty are constructed. These results strengthen a theorem of McGibbon and Rector which states that among the uncountably many homotopy types in its genus, \hpinfty is the only one which admits a maximal torus.
