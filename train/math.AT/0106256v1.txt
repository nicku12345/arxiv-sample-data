In this paper we define a secondary Brown-Kervaire quadratic forms. Among the applications we obtain a complete classification of (n-2)-connected 2n-dimensional framed manifolds up to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence, . In particular, we prove that the homotopy type of such manifolds determine their homeomorphism type.
