The paper containes a proof that the mapping class group of the manifold S^3\times S^3 is isomorphic to a central extension of the (full) Jacobi group \Gamma^J by the group of 7-dimensional homotopy spheres. Using a presentation of the group \Gamma^J and the \mu-invariant of the homotopy spheres, we give a presentation of the mapping class group of S^3\times S^3 with generators and defining relations. We also compute cohomology of the group \Gamma^J and determine a 2-cocycle that corresponds to the mapping class group of S^3\times S^3.
