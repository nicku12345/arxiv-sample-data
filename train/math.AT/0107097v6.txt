This paper explicitely constructs cofree coalgebras over operads in the category of DG-modules. Special cases are considered in which the general expression simplifies (such as the pointed, irreducible case). It is shown that the existence of an operad-action on a coalgebra implies a ``generalized coassociativity'' that facilitates the construction. Some areas of application are discussed.
