In the two parts of this paper we solve a problem of De Rham, proving that Reidemeister torsion invariants determine topological equivalence of linear G-representations, for G a finite cyclic group. Methods in controlled K-theory and surgery theory are developed to establish, and effectively calculate, a necessary and sufficient condition for non-linear similarity in terms of the vanishing of certain non-compact transfer maps. For cyclic groups of 2-power order, we obtain a complete classification of non-linear similarities.
