The main construction of this paper contains a serious error, and I am withdrawing it.   I owe Andrew Stacey and Ralph Cohen thanks for seeing the problem; in particular, Stacey has shown that the projections constructed in \S 3.1 will fail in general to have constant rank, so the family {\bf T}V of vector spaces defined by their images fails to be a vector bundle.   I'm very sorry to have caused this confusion. To researchers interested in these questions, I recommend the papers of Cohen, Godin, and Stacey cited below:   R. Cohen, V.
