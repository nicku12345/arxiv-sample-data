Let X be a simply connected space and {\Bbb F}_p be a prime field. The algebra of normalized singular cochains N^*(X; {\Bbb F}_p) admits a natural homotopy structure which induces natural Steenrod operations on the Hochschild homology HH_* N^*(X;{\Bbb F}_p) of the space X. The primary purpose of this paper is to prove that the J. Jones isomorphism HH_*N^*(X;{\Bbb F}_p) \cong H ^*(X^{S^1};{\Bbb F}_p) identifies theses Stenrood operations with those defined on the cohomology of the free loop space with coefficients in {\Bbb F}_p. The other goal of this paper is to describe a theoritic model which allows to do some computations.
