An algebraic theory T is a category with objects t_0,t_2... such that for each n the object t_n is an n-fold categorical product of t_1. A strict T-algebra is a product preserving functor A: T\to Spaces. Lawvere showed that for a suitable choice of T giving such an algebra amounts to providing the space A(t_1) with a familiar structure of a monoid group, ring, Lie algebra...   Given a functor X: T\to Spaces which preserves products up to a weak equivalence we show that X is more or less canonically weakly equivalent to a strict T-algebra LX. Thus any `homotopy' algebraic structure on the space X(t_1) can be rigidified to a strict algebraic structure on a space weakly equivalent to X(t_1). This fact can be interpreted as a generalization of the results establishing equivalence of homotopy theories of loop spaces and simplicial groups, products of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces and abelian monoids etc.
