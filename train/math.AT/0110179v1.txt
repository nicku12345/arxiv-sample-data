We determine the contributions of isolated singularities of spin V 4-manifolds to the index of the Dirac operator over them. From these data we derive certain constraints on the intersection forms of spin 4-manifolds bounded by spherical 3-manifolds, and also on the embeddings of the real projective planes into 4-manifolds.
