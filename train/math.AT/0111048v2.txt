Directed Algebraic Topology is beginning to emerge from various applications.   The basic structure we shall use for such a theory, a 'd-space', is a topological space equipped with a family of 'directed paths', closed under some operations. This allows for 'directed homotopies', generally non reversible, represented by a cylinder and cocylinder functors. The existence of 'pastings' (colimits) yields a geometric realisation of cubical sets as d-spaces, together with homotopy constructs which will be developed in a sequel. Here, the 'fundamental category' of a d-space is introduced and a 'Seifert - van Kampen' theorem proved; its homotopy invariance rests on 'directed homotopy' of categories. In the process, new shapes appear, for d-spaces but also for small categories, their elementary algebraic model.   Applications of such tools are briefly considered or suggested, for objects which model a directed image, or a portion of space-time, or a concurrent process.
