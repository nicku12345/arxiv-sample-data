Local cohomology techniques in equivariant homotopy theory, introduced by John Greenlees, may be applied to understand homology of classifying spaces through other equivariant data. In this paper we relate the local cohomology filtration to the families filtration. By doing so, we may identify geometry codified by the local cohomology filtration in the setting of equivariant bordism. The constructions which arise are naturally analyzed by localized K-theory machinery due to Atiyah and Segal, which we review.
