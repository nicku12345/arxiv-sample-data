The holomorph of a free group F_n is the semidirect product F_n \rtimes Aut(F_n). Using the methods of Hatcher and Vogtmann, we derive stability results and calculate the mod-p homology of these holomorphs for odd primes p in dimensions 1 and 2, and their rational homology in dimensions 1 through 5. Calculations of the twisted (where Aut(F_n) acts by first projecting to Gl_n(\Z) and then including in Gl_n(\Q)) homology H_*(Aut(F_n); \Q^n) follow in corresponding dimensions.
