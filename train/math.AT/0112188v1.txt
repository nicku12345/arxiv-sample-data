It is not known whether or not the stable rational cohomology groups \tilde H^*(Aut(F_\infty);\Q) always vanish. We show that either the rational cohomology does not vanish in certain dimensions, or the integral cohomology of a moduli space of pointed graphs does not stabilize in certain other dimensions. Similar results are stated for groups of outer automorphisms. This yields that H^5(\hat Q_m; \mathbb{Z}), H^6(\hat Q_m; \mathbb{Z}), and H^5(Q_m; \mathbb{Z}) never stabilize as m \to \infty, where the moduli spaces \hat Q_m and Q_m are the quotients of the spines \hat X_m and X_m of ``outer space'' and ``auter space'', respectively, introduced by Culler and Vogtmann and by Hatcher and Vogtmann.
