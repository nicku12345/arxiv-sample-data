We examine the palindromic automorphism group \Pi A(F_n) of a free group F_n, a group first defined by Collins which is related to hyperelliptic involutions of mapping class groups, congruence subgroups of SL_n(\Z), and symmetric automorphism groups of free groups. Cohomological properties of the group are explored by looking at a contractible space on which \Pi A(F_n) acts properly with finite quotient. Our results answer some conjectures of Collins and provide a few striking results about the cohomology of \Pi A(F_n), such as that its rational cohomology is zero at the vcd.
