For odd primes p, we examine \hat H^*(Aut(F_{2(p-1)}); \Z_{(p)}), the Farrell cohomology of the group of automorphisms of a free group F_{2(p-1)} on 2(p-1) generators, with coefficients in the integers localized at the prime (p) \subset \Z. This extends results by Glover and Mislin, whose calculations yield \hat H^*(Aut(F_n); \Z_{(p)}) for n \in \{p-1,p\} and is concurrent with work by Chen where he calculates \hat H^*(Aut(F_n); \Z_{(p)}) for n \in \{p+1,p+2\}. The main tools used are Ken Brown's ``normalizer spectral sequence'', a modification of Krstic and Vogtmann's proof of the contractibility of fixed point sets for outer space, and a modification of the Degree Theorem of Hatcher and Vogtmann.
