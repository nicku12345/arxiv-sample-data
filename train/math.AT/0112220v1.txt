We study co-H-maps from a suspension to the suspension of the projective plane and provide examples of non-suspension 3-cell co-H-spaces. These (infinitely many) examples are related to the homotopy groups of the 3-sphere. For each element of order 2 in \pi_n(S^3), there is a corresponding non-suspension co-H-space of cells in dimensions 2, 3 and n+2.   Our ideas are to study Hopf invariants in combinatorial way by using the Cohen groups.
