We study fundamental groups of algebraic stacks. We show that these fundamental groups carry an additional structure coming from the inertia groups. Then use this additional structure to analyze geometric/ topological properties of stacks. We give an explicit formula for the fundamental group of the coarse moduli space. Also, we use these additional structures to give a necessary and sufficient for an algebraic stack to be uniformizable.
