A criterion to determine the L-S category of a total space of a sphere-bundle over a sphere is given in terms of homotopy invariants of its characteristic map, and thus providing a complete answer to Ganea's Problem 4. As a result, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such a total space N to have the same L-S category as its `once punctured submanifold' N\smallsetminus\{P\}, P \in N. Also a necessary condition for such a total space M to satisfy Ganea's conjecture is obtained.
