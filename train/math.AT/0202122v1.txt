We determine the L-S category of Sp(3) by showing that the 5-fold reduced diagonal \widebar{\Delta}_5 is given by \nu^2, using a Toda bracket and a generalised cohomology theory h^* given by h^*(X,A) = \{X/A,{\mathbb S}[0,2]\}, where {\mathbb S}[0,2] is the 3-stage Postnikov piece of the sphere spectrum {\mathbb S}. This method also yields a general result that \cat(Sp(n)) \geq n+2 for n \geq 3, which improves the result of Singhof.
