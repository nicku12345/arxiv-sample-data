An arrangement of k-semilines in the Euclidean (projective) plane or on the 2-sphere is called a k-fan if all semilines start from the same point. A k-fan is an \alpha-partition for a probability measure \mu if \mu(\sigma_i)=\alpha_i for each i=1,...,k where \{\sigma_i\}_{i=1}^k are conical sectors associated with the k-fan and \alpha = (\alpha_1,... ,\alpha_k). The set of all \alpha = (\alpha_1,... ,\alpha_m) such that for any collection of probability measures \mu_1,... ,\mu_m there exists a common \alpha-partition by a k-fan is denoted by {\cal A}_{m,k}. We prove, as a central result of this paper, that {\cal A}_{3,2} = \{(s,t)\in \mathbb{R}^2\mid s+t=1 {\rm and} s,t>0\}. The result follows from the fact that under mild conditions there does not exist a Q_{4n}-equivariant map f : S^3\to V\setminus {\cal A}(\alpha) where {\cal A}(\alpha) is a Q_{4n}-invariant, linear subspace arrangement in a Q_{4n}-representation V, where Q_{4n} is the generalized quaternion group. This fact is established by showing that an appropriate obstruction in the group \Omega_1(Q_{4n}) of Q_{4n}-bordisms does not vanish.
