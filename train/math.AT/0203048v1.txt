We prove that for every integer k>1 there is a simply connected rational homology 5-sphere \scriptstyle{M^5_k} with spin such that \scriptstyle{H_2(M^5_k,\bbz)} has order \scriptstyle{k^2}, and \scriptstyle{M^5_k} admits a Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature. Moreover, if the prime number decomposition of \scriptstyle{k} has the form \scriptstyle{k=p_1... p_r} for distinct primes \scriptstyle{p_i} then \scriptstyle{M^5_k} is uniquely determined.
