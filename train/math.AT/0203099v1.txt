We observe that any regular Lie groupoid G over an manifold M fits into an extension K \to G \to E of a foliation groupoid E by a bundle of connected Lie groups K. If \FF is the foliation on M given by the orbits of E and T is a complete transversal to \FF, this extension restricts to T, as an extension K_{T}\to G_{T}\to E_{T} of an \'etale groupoid E_{T} by a bundle of connected groups K_{T}. We break up the classification into two parts. On the one hand, we classify the latter extensions of \'etale groupoids by (non-abelian) cohomology classes in a new \v{C}ech cohomology of \'{e}tale groupoids. On the other hand, given K and E and an extension K_{T}\to G_{T}\to E_{T} over T, we present a cohomological obstruction to the problem of whether this is the restriction of an extension K \to G \to E over M; if this obstruction vanishes, all extensions K \to G \to E over M which restrict to a given extension over the transversal together form a principal bundle over a ``group'' of bitorsors under K.
