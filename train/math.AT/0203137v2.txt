The loop homology of a closed orientable manifold M of dimension d is the ordinary homology of the free loop space M^{S^1} with degrees shifted by d, i.e. \mathbb H_*(M^{S^1}) = H_{*+d}(M^{S^1}). Chas and Sullivan have defined a loop product on \mathbb H_*(M^{S^1}) and an intersection morphism I : \mathbb H_*(M^{S^1}) \to H_*(\Omega M). The algebra \mathbb H_*(M^{S^1}) is commutative and I is a morphism of algebras. In this paper we produce a model that computes the algebra \mathbb H_*(M^{S^1}) and the morphism I. We show that the kernel of I is nilpotent and that the image is contained in the center of H_*(\Omega M), which is in general quite small.
