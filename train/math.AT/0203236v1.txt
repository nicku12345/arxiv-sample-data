In this note we introduce an action of cyclohedra on the free loop space. We will then discuss how this action can be used for an appropriate recognition principle in the same manner as the action of Stasheff's associahedra can be used to recognize based loop spaces. We will also interpret one result of R.L. Cohen as an approximation theorem, in the spirit of Beck and May, for free loop spaces.
