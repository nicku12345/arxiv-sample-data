Let P be a closed smooth (4j-2)-connected 8j-manifold. We complete Wilkens' classification of the manifolds P for j = 1,2 and give an alternative proof to Wall's classification of the manifolds for j > 2. The Hopf-invariant-one dimensions (j=1,2) are characteristed by the fact that the quadratic linking functions which classify may be inhomogeneous. Hence we also extend the classification of (homogeneous) quadratic linking forms on finite abelian groups (due to Nikulin) to the inhomogeneous case.
