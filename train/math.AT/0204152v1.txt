Let M be a simply-connected closed oriented N-dimensional manifold. We prove that for any field of coefficients there exists a natural homomorphism of commutative graded algebras \Psi : H_\ast (\Omega {aut}_1 M) \to H_{\ast +N}(M^{S^1}) where H_\ast (M^{S^1}) is the loop algebra defined by Chas-Sullivan. As usual {aut}_1 X (resp. \Omega X) denotes the monoid of the self-equivalences homotopic to the identity map (resp. the space of based loops) of the space X. Moreover, if \bk is of characteristic zero, \Psi yields isomorphisms \pi_n(\Omega {aut}_1 M) \otimes \bk \cong \hH^{n+N}_{(1)} where \displaystyle \oplus_{l=1}^\infty \hH^n_{(l)} denotes the Hodge decomposition on H^\ast (M ^{S^1}).
