We prove a new selection theorem for multivalued mappings of C-space. Using this theorem we prove extension dimensional version of Hurewicz theorem for a closed mapping f\colon X\to Y of k-space X onto paracompact C-space Y: if for finite CW-complex M we have \ed Y\le [M] and for every point y\in Y and every compactum Z with \ed Z\le [M] we have \ed(f^{-1}(y)\times Z)\le [L] for some CW-complex L, then \ed X\le [L].
