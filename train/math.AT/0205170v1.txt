Let V be a mod 2 vector space of rank k. W. Singer defined a transfer homomorphism from the GL(k,2) coinvariants of the primitives in the homology of BV to the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, as an algebraic version of the geometric transfer from the stable homotopy of BV to the stable homotopy of spheres. It has been shown that the algebraic transfer is highly nontrivial and, more precisely, that it is an isomorphism for k=1, 2, or 3. However, Singer showed that it is not an epimorphism for k=5. In this paper, we prove that it also fails to be an epimorphism when k=4. Precisely, it does not detect the non zero elements in the g family, in stems 20, 44, 92, and in general, 12*2^s - 4, for each s > 0. The transfer still fails to be an epimorphism even after inverting Sq^0, thereby giving a negative answer to a prediction by Minami.
