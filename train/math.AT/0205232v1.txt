One of the important theorems in homotopy theory is the Hilton splitting. In this paper we will construct all the Hilton homomorphisms by geometrical means and prove a family of sharper symmetry relations of linking coefficients which desuspend and generalize the relations of Kervaire, Haefliger and Steer.
