We obtain explicit formulas for the rational homotopy groups of generalised symmetric spaces, i.e., the homogeneous spaces for which the isotropy subgroup appears as the fixed point group of some finite order automorphism of the group. In particular, this gives explicit formulas for the rational homotopy groups of all classical compact symmetric spaces.
