Using a global version of the equivariant Chern character, we describe the complexified twisted equivariant K-theory of a space with a compact Lie group action in terms of fixed-point data. We apply this to the case of a compact Lie group acting on itself by conjugation, and relate the result to the Verlinde algebra and to the Kac numerator at q=1. Verlinde's formula is also discussed in this context.
