In this paper, we give a fully detailed exposition of computing fundamental groups of complements of line arrangements using the Moishezon-Teicher technique for computing the braid monodromy of a curve and the Van-Kampen theorem which induces a presentation of the fundamental group of the complement from the braid monodromy of the curve.   For example, we treated the cases where the arrangement has t multiple intersection points and the rest are simple intersection points. In this case, the fundamental group of the complement is a direct sum of infinite cyclic groups and t free groups. Hence, the fundamental groups in these cases is ``big''. These calculations will be useful in computing the fundamental group of Hirzebruch covering surfaces.
