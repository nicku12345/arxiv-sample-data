This paper is concerned with a minimal resolution of the PROP for bialgebras. We prove a theorem about the form of this resolution (Theorem 15) and give, in Section 5, a lot of explicit formulas for the differential.   Our minimal model contains all information about the deformation theory of bialgebras and related cohomology. Algebras over this minimal model are strongly homotopy bialgebras, that is, homotopy invariant versions of bialgebras.
