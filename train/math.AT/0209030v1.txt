Spaces in the genus of infinite quaternionic projective space which admit essential maps from infinite complex projective space are classified. In these cases the sets of homotopy classes of maps are described explicitly. These results strengthen the classical theorem of McGibbon and Rector on maximal torus admissibility for spaces in the genus of infinite quaternionic projective space. An interpretation of these results in the context of Adams-Wilkerson embedding in integral K-theory is also given.
