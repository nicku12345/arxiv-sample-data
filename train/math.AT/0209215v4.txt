We show that the homotopy theory of differential graded algebras coincides with the homotopy theory of HZ-algebra spectra. Namely, we construct Quillen equivalences between the Quillen model categories of (unbounded) differential graded algebras and HZ-algebra spectra. We also construct Quillen equivalences between the differential graded modules and module spectra over these algebras. We use these equivalences in turn to produce algebraic models for rational stable model categories. We show that bascially any rational stable model category is Quillen equivalent to modules over a differential graded Q-algebra (with many objects).
