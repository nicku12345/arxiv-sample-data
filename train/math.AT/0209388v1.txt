We uncover a somewhat surprising connection between spaces of multiplicative maps between A_\infty-ring spectra and topological Hochschild cohomology. As a consequence we show that such spaces become infinite loop spaces after looping only once. We also prove that any multiplicative cohomology operation in complex cobordisms theory MU canonically lifts to an A_\infty-map MU\to MU. This implies, in particular, that the Brown-Peterson spectrum BP splits off MU as an A_\infty-ring spectrum.
