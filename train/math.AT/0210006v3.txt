In the paper the notion of truncating twisting function \tau :X\to Q from a simplicial set X to a cubical set Q and the corresponding notion of twisted Cartesian product of these sets X\times_{\tau}Q are introduced. The latter becomes a cubical set whose chain complex coincides with the standard twisted tensor product C_*(X)\otimes_{\tau_*}C_*(Q). This construction together with the theory of twisted tensor products for homotopy G-algebras allows to obtain multiplicative models for fibrations.
