Let G be a compact Lie group, and let LG denote the corresponding loop group. Let (X,\omega) be a weakly symplectic Banach manifold. Consider a Hamiltonian action of LG on (X,\omega), and assume that the moment map \mu: X \to L\fg^* is proper. We consider the function |\mu|^2: X \to \R, and use a version of Morse theory to show that the inclusion map j:\mu^{-1}(0)\to X induces a surjection j^*:H_G^*(X) \to H_G^*(\mu^{-1}(0)), in analogy with Kirwan's surjectivity theorem in the finite-dimensional case. We also prove a version of this surjectivity theorem for quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces.
