Stasheff's A(\infty)-algebra (M,\{m_i:\otimes^iM\to M, i=1,2,3,...\}) in fact is a DG-algebra (M,m_1,m_2) with not necessarily associative product m_2 but this nonassociativity is measured by higher homotopies m_{i>2}. Nevertheless such structure arises in the strictly associative situation too, namely in the homology algebra H(C) of a DG-algebra C with free H_i(C)-s, particularly in the cohomology algebra H^*(X,\Lambda) of a topological space X. It is clear that the A(\infty)-algebra (H^*(X,\Lambda),\{m_i\}) carries more information than the cohomology algebra H^*(B,\Lambda). Naturally arises a question when this structure is degenerate, that is when an A(\infty)-algebra (M, \{m_i\}) is isomorphic to one with higher operations m_i, i\geq 3 trivial? In this paper we introduce the obstructions for such degeneracy. Namely, operations \{m_i\} we interpret as Hochschild twisting cochain m=m_3+m_4+..., m_i\in C^n(M,M) satisfying \delta m=m\smile_1m where \smile_1 is Gerstenhabers product in C^*(M,M). Using the generalized product f\smile_1(g_1,...,g_k) we define perturbations of Hochschild twisting cochains (i.e. of A(\infty) structures) and in particular prove that if for a graded algebra (M,\mu) all Hochschild cohomologies Hoch^{n,2-n}(M,M)=0 for n\geq3 then any A(\infty)-algebra structure \{m_i\} on M with m_1=0, m_2=\mu , is degenerate.
