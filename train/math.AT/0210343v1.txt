We construct new topological invariants of three-dimensional manifolds which can, in particular, distinguish homotopy equivalent lens spaces L(7,1) and L(7,2). The invariants are built on the base of a classical (not quantum) solution of pentagon equation, i.e.algebraic relation corresponding to a ``2 tetrahedra to 3 tetrahedra'' local re-building of a manifold triangulation. This solution, found earlier by one of the authors, is expressed in terms of metric characteristics of Euclidean tetrahedra.
