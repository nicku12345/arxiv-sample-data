Chas and Sullivan recently defined an intersection product on the homology H_*(LM) of the space of smooth loops in a closed, oriented manifold M. In this paper we will use the homotopy theoretic realization of this product described by the first two authors to construct a second quadrant spectral sequence of algebras converging to the loop homology multiplicatively, when M is simply connected. The E_2 term of this spectral sequence is H^*(M;H_*(\Omega M)) where the product is given by the cup product on the cohomology of the manifold H^* (M) with coefficients in the Pontryagin ring structure on the homology of its based loop space H_*(\Omega M). We then use this spectral sequence to compute the ring structures of H_* (LS^n) and H_* (L\bcp^n).
