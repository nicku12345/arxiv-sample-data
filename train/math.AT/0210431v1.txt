Assume (M, \omega) is a connected, compact 6 dimensional symplectic manifold equipped with a semi-free Hamiltonian circle action, such that the fixed point set consists of isolated points or compact orientable surfaces. We restrict attention to the case \dim H^2(M)<3. We give a complete list of the possible manifolds, determine their equivariant cohomology ring and equivariant Chern classes. Some of these manifolds are classified up to diffeomorphism. We also show the existence for a few cases.
