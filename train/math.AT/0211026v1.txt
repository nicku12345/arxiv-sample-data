Let B denote the upper triangular subgroup of SL_2(C), T its diagonal torus and U its unipotent radical. A complex projective variety Y endowed with an algebraic action of B such that the fixed point set Y^U is a single point, is called regular. Associated to any regular B-variety Y, there is a remarkable affine curve Z_Y with a T-action which was studied by the second author. In this note, we show that the coordinate ring of Z_Y is isomorphic with the equivariant cohomology ring H_T^*(Y) with complex coefficients, when Y is smooth or, more generally, is a B-stable subvariety of a regular smooth B-variety X such that the restriction map from H^*(X) to H^*(Y) is surjective. This isomorphism is obtained as a refinement of the localization theorem in equivariant cohomology; it applies e.g. to Schubert varieties in flag varieties, and to the Peterson variety studied by Kostant. Another application of our isomorphism is a natural algebraic formula for the equivariant push forward.
