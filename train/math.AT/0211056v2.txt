The total homology of the loop space of the configuration space of ordered distinct n points in R^m has a structure of a Hopf algebra defined by the 4-term relations if m>2. We describe a relation of between the cohomology of this loop space and the set of finite type invariants for the pure braid group with n strands. Based on this we give expressions of certain link invariants as integrals over cycles of the above loop space.
