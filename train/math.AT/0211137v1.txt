Let \Hol_{x_0}^{{\bf n}} (\C\P^1, X) be the space of based holomorphic maps of degree {\bf n} from \C\P^1 into a simply connected algebraic variety X. Under some condition we prove that the map \map \Hol_{x_0}^{{\bf n}} (\C\P^1, X). \Hol_{x_0}^{d{\bf n}} (\C\P^1, X). obtained by compositing f \in \Hol_{x_0}^{{\bf n}} (\C\P^1, X) with g(z)=z^d, z \in \C\P^1 induces rational homotopy equivalence up to some dimension, which tends to infinity as the degree grows.
