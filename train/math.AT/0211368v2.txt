In this paper we show that if a cosimplicial space or spectrum X^\bullet has a certain kind of combinatorial structure (we call it a \Xi^n-structure) then the total space of X^\b has an action of a certain operad which is weakly equivalent to the little n-cubes operad. The n\leq 2 case was proved by a more complicated argument in our earlier paper A Solution of Deligne's Hochschild Cohomology Conjecture (http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.QA/9910126). In the special case n=\infty, we define a symmetric monoidal structure \boxtimes on cosimplicial spaces and show that if X^\b is a commutative \boxtimes-monoid then the total space of \X^\b is an E_\infty space.
