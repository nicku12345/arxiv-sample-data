We describe the singular cohomology ring, the K-ring of complex vector bundles, the Chow ring, and the Grothendieck ring of coherent sheaves of the total space of the fibre bundle with base space an irreducible nonsingular complete Noetherian scheme and fibre a nonsingular projective T-toric variety associated to a prinicipal T-bundle over the field of complex numbers.
