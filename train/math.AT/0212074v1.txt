We introduce a new spectral sequence called the p-chain spectral sequence which converges to the (co-)homology of a contravariant C-space with coefficients in a covariant C-spectrum for a small category C. It is different from the corresponding Atiyah-Hirzebruch type spectral sequence. It can be used in combination with the Isomorphism Conjectures of Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones to compute algebraic K- and L-groups of group rings and topological K-groups of reduced group C*-algebras.
