A new relation between a class of complex polynomials with a good behavior at infinity studied by A. N\'emethi and A. Zaharia and the cohomology groups of affine complex hyperplane arrangement complements with rank one local system coefficients is introduced and explored.   This approach gives in particular new upper-bounds for the dimension of the twisted cohomology groups of line arrangement complements in the complex affine plane.
