In math.AG/0207028 we began the study of higher sheaf theory (i.e. stacks theory) on higher categories endowed with a suitable notion of topology: precisely, we defined the notions of S-site and of model site, and the associated categories of stacks on them. This led us to study a notion of \textit{model topos} (orginally due to C. Rezk), a model category version of the notion of Grothendieck topos. In this paper we treat the analogous theory starting from (1-)Segal categories in place of S-categories and model categories. We introduce notions of Segal topologies, Segal sites and stacks over them. We define an abstract notion of Segal topos and relate it with Segal categories of stacks over Segal sites. We compare the notions of Segal topoi and of model topoi, showing that the two theories are equivalent in some sense. However, the existence of a nice Segal category of morphisms between Segal categories allows us to improve the treatment of topoi in this context. In particular we construct the 2-Segal category of Segal topoi and geometric morphisms, and we provide a Giraud-like statement characterizing Segal topoi among Segal categories. As an example of applications, we show how to reconstruct a topological space up to homotopy from the Segal topos of locally constant stacks on it, thus extending the main theorem of Toen, "Vers une interpretation Galoisienne de la theorie de l'homotopie" (to appear in Cahiers de top. et geom. diff. cat.) to the case of un-based spaces. We also give some hints of how to define homotopy types of Segal sites: this approach gives a new point of view and some improvements on the \'etale homotopy theory of schemes, and more generally on the theory of homotopy types of Grothendieck sites as defined by Artin and Mazur.
