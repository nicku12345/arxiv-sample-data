Let T be a torus. We show that Koszul duality can be used to compute the equivariant cohomology of topological T-spaces as well as the cohomology of pull backs of the universal T-bundle. The new features are that no further assumptions about the spaces are made and that the coefficient ring may be arbitrary. This gives in particular a Cartan-type model for the equivariant cohomology of a T-space with arbitrary coefficients. Our method works for intersection homology as well.
