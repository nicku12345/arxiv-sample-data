In the present paper we study some homotopy invariants which can be defined by means of bundles with fiber a matrix algebra. We also introduce some generalization of the Brauer group in the topological context and show that any its element can be represented as a locally trivial bundle with a group of invertible operators in a Hilbert space as the structure group. Finally, we discuss its possible applications in the twisted K-theory.
