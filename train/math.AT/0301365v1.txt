We consider partitions of a set with r elements ordered by refinement. We consider the simplicial complex \bar{K}(r) formed by chains of partitions which starts at the smallest element and ends at the largest element of the partition poset. A classical theorem asserts that \bar{K}(r) is equivalent to a wedge of r-1-dimensional spheres. In addition, the poset of partitions is equipped with a natural action of the symmetric group in r letters. Consequently, the associated homology modules are representations of the symmetric groups. One observes that the r-1th homology modules of \bar{K}(r), where r = 1,2,..., are dual to the Lie representation of the symmetric groups.   In this article, we would like to point out that this theorem occurs a by-product of the theory of \emph{Koszul operads}. For that purpose, we improve results of V. Ginzburg and M. Kapranov in several directions. More particularly, we extend the Koszul duality of operads to operads defined over a field of positive characteristic (or over a ring). In addition, we obtain more conceptual proofs of theorems of V. Ginzburg and M. Kapranov.
