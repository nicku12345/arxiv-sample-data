In general the processes of taking a homotopy inverse limit of a diagram of spectra and smashing spectra with a fixed space do not commute. In this paper we investigate under what additional assumptions these two processes do commute. In fact we deal with an equivariant generalization which involves spectra and smash products over the orbit category of a discrete group. Such a situation naturally occurs if one studies the equivariant homology theory associated to topological cyclic homology. The main theorem of this paper will play a role in the generalization of the results obtained by Boekstedt, Hsiang and Madsen about the algebraic K-theory Novikov Conjecture to the assembly map for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups.
