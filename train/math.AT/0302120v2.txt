The holomorph of a discrete group G is the universal semi-direct product of G. In chapter 1 we describe why it is an interesting object and state main results.   In chapter 2 we recall the classical definition of the holomorph as well as this universal property, and give some group theoretic properties and examples of holomorphs. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a map of split extensions for holomorphs of two groups.   In chapter 3 we construct a resolution for Hol(Z_{p^r}) for every prime p, where {\mathbb Z}_m denotes a cyclic group of order m, and use it to compute the integer homology and mod p cohomology ring of Hol(Z_{p^r}).   In chapter 4 we study the holomorph of the direct sum of several copies of Z_{p^r}. We identify this holomorph as a nice subgroup of GL(n+1, Z_{p^r}), thus its cohomology informs on the cohomology of the general linear group which has been of interest in the subject. We show that the LHS spectral sequence for H^*(Hol(\bigoplus_n Z_{p^r}); F_p) does not collapse at the E_2 stage for p^r\ge 8. Also, we compute mod p cohomology and the first Bockstein homomorphisms of the congruence subgroups given by Ker (Hol(\bigoplus_n Z_{p^r}) \to Hol(\bigoplus_n Z_p)).   In chapter 5 we recall wreath products and permutative categories, and their connections with holomorphs.   In chapter 6 we give a short proof of the well-known fact due to S. Eilenberg and J. C. Moore that the only injective object in the category of groups is the trivial group.
