If A is a graded connected algebra then we define a new invariant, polydepth A, which is finite if Ext_A^*(M,A) \neq 0 for some A-module M of at most polynomial growth. Theorem 1: If f : X \to Y is a continuous map of finite category, and if the orbits of H_*(\Omega Y) acting in the homology of the homotopy fibre grow at most polynomially, then H_*(\Omega Y) has finite polydepth. Theorem 2: If L is a graded Lie algebra and polydepth UL is finite then either L is solvable and UL grows at most polynomially or else for some integer d and all r, \sum_{i=k+1}^{k+d} {dim} L_i \geq k^r, k\geq some k(r).
