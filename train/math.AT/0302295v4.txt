Let N_1, N_2, M be smooth manifolds with dim N_1 + dim N_2 +1 = dim M and let phi_i, for i=1,2, be smooth mappings of N_i to M with Im phi_1 and Im phi_2 disjoint. The classical linking number lk(phi_1,phi_2) is defined only when phi_1*[N_1] = phi_2*[N_2] = 0 in H_*(M).   The affine linking invariant alk is a generalization of lk to the case where phi_1*[N_1] or phi_2*[N_2] are not zero-homologous. In arXiv:math.GT/0207219 we constructed the first examples of affine linking invariants of nonzero-homologous spheres in the spherical tangent bundle of a manifold, and showed that alk is intimately related to the causality relation of wave fronts on manifolds.   In this paper we develop the general theory. The invariant alk appears to be a universal Vassiliev-Goussarov invariant of order < 2. In the case where phi_1*[N_1] and phi_2*[N_2] are 0 in homology it is a splitting of the classical linking number into a collection of independent invariants.   To construct alk we introduce a new pairing mu on the bordism groups of spaces of mappings of N_1 and N_2 into M, not necessarily under the restriction dim N_1 + dim N_2 +1 = dim M. For the zero-dimensional bordism groups, mu can be related to the Hatcher-Quinn invariant. In the case N_1=N_2=S^1, it is related to the Chas-Sullivan string homology super Lie bracket, and to the Goldman Lie bracket of free loops on surfaces.
