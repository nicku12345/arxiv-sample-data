Let F \hookrightarrow X \to B be a fibre bundle with structure group G, where B is (d{-}1)-connected and of finite dimension, d \geq 1. We prove that the strong L-S category of X is less than or equal to m + \frac{\dim B}{d}, if F has a cone decomposition of length m under a compatibility condition with the action of G on F. This gives a consistent prospect to determine the L-S category of non-simply connected Lie groups. For example, we obtain \cat{PU(n)} \leq 3(n{-}1) for all n \geq 1, which might be best possible, since we have \cat{\mathrm{PU}(p^r)}=3(p^r{-}1) for any prime p and r \geq 1. Similarly, we obtain the L-S category of \mathrm{SO}(n) for n \leq 9 and \mathrm{PO}(8). We remark that all the above Lie groups satisfy the Ganea conjecture on L-S category.
