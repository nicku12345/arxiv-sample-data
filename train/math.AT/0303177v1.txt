We give in this paper an isomorphism theorem between derived functors over categories of modules.There is a nice class of categories that gives examples in which this theorem applies for a special construction. This leads us to a new interpretation of a theorem of Pirashvili and Richter about cyclic homology and Hochschild homology.
