Let G be a chordal graph, X(G) the complement of the associated complex arrangement and Gamma(G) the fundamental group of X(G). We show that Gamma(G) is a limit of colored braid groups over the poset of simplices of G. When G = G_T is the comparability graph associated with a rooted tree T, a case recently investigated by the first author, the result takes the following very simple form: Gamma(G_T) is a limit over T of colored braid groups.
