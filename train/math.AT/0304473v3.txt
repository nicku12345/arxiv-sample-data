We investigate Gamma-cohomology of some commutative cooperation algebras E_*E associated with certain periodic cohomology theories. For KU and E(1), the Adams summand at a prime p, and for KO we show that Gamma-cohomology vanishes above degree 1. As these cohomology groups are the obstruction groups in the obstruction theory developed by Alan Robinson we deduce that these spectra admit unique E infinity structures. As a consequence we obtain an E infinity structure for the connective Adams summand. For the Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(n) with n > 0 we establish the existence of a unique E infinity structure for its I_n-adic completion.
