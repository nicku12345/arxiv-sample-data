For any two graphs G and H Lov\'asz has defined a cell complex Hom(G,H) having in mind the general program that the algebraic invariants of these complexes should provide obstructions to graph colorings. Here we announce the proof of a conjecture of Lov\'asz concerning these complexes with G a cycle of odd length. More specifically, we show that: if Hom(C_{2r+1},G) is k-connected, then \chi(G)\geq k+4. Our actual statement is somewhat sharper, as we find obstructions already in the non-vanishing of powers of certain Stiefel-Whitney classes.
