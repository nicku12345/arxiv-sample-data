We construct closed (k-1)-connected manifolds of dimensions \ge 4k-1 that possess non-trivial rational Massey triple products. We also construct examples of manifolds M such that all the cup-products of elements of H^k(M) vanish, while the group H^{3k-1}(M;\Q) is generated by Massey products: such examples are useful for theory of systols.
