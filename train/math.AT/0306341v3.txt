If K is a compact Lie group and g\geq 2 an integer, the space K^{2g} is endowed with the structure of a Hamiltonian space with a Lie group valued moment map \Phi. Let \beta be in the centre of K. The reduction \Phi^{-1}(\beta)/K is homeomorphic to a moduli space of flat connections. When K is simply connected, a direct consequence of a recent paper of Bott, Tolman and Weitsman is to give a set of generators for the K-equivariant cohomology of \Phi^{-1}(\beta). Another method to construct classes in H^*_K(\Phi^{-1}(\beta)) is by using the so called universal bundle. When the group is \Sun and \beta is a generator of the centre, these last classes are known to also generate the equivariant cohomology of \Phi^{-1}(\beta). The aim of this paper is to compare the classes constructed using the result of Bott, Tolman and Weitsman and the ones using the universal bundle.
