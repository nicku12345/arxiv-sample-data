We express the signature {\rm Sign}(SP^m_G(M)) of the symmetric product SP^n(M) of an (open) surface M in terms of the cycle index Z(G;\bar x) of G, a polynomial which originally appeared in P{\' o}lya enumeration theory of graphs, trees, chemical structures etc. The computations are used to show that there exist punctured Riemann surfaces M_{g,k}, M_{g',k'} such that the manifolds SP^{m}(M_{g,k}) and SP^{m}(M_{g',k'}) are often not homeomorphic, although they always have the same homotopy type provided 2g+k = 2g'+k' and k,k'\geq 1.
