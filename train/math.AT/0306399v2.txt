Using the topological technique of diagrams of spaces, we calculate the homology of the union and the complement of finite arrangements of subspaces of the form D + SP^{n-d}(X) in symmetric products SP^n(X) where D\in SP^d(X). As an application we include a computation of the homology of the homotopy end space of the open manifold SP^n(M_{g,k}), where M_{g,k} is a Riemann surface of genus g punctured at k points, a problem which was originally motivated by the study of commutative (m+k,m)-groups.
