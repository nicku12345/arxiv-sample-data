The use of homological and homotopical devices, such as Tor and Andr\'e-Quillen homology, have found substantial use in characterizing commutative algebras. The primary category setting has been differentially graded algebras and modules, but recently simplicial categories have also proved to be useful settings. In this paper, we take this point of view up a notch by extending some recent uses of homological algebra in characterizing Noetherian commutative algebras to characterizing simplicial commutative algebras having finite Noetherian homotopy through the use of simplicial homotopy theory. These characterizations involve extending the notions of locally complete intersections and locally Gorenstein algebras to the simplicial homotopy setting.
