L. Avramov, following D. Quillen, posed a conjecture to the effect that if R \to A is a homomorphism of Noetherian rings then the Andr\'e-Quillen homology on the category of A-modules satisfies: D_{s}(A|R;-) = 0 for s\gg 0 implies D_{s}(A|R;-) = 0 for s>2. In an earlier paper, the author posed an extended version of this conjecture which considered A to be a simplicial commutative R-algebra with Noetherian homotopy such that the characteristic of \pi_{0}A is non-zero. In addition, a homotopy characterization of such algebras was described. The main goal of this paper is to develop a strategy for establishing this extended conjecture and provide a complete proof when R is Cohen-Macaulay of characteristic 2.
