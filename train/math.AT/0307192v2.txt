We study the analytic and homotopy properties of some infinite dimensional Grassmannians, useful for developing a Morse theory for infinite dimensional manifolds. We study the space of Fredholm pairs of a Hilbert space, we determine its homotopy type, and we define a determinant bundle over it. We study the space of compact perturbations of a given closed linear subspace, and the related concept of essential Grassmannian.
