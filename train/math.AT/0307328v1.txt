We generalize the classical study of Alexander polynomials of smooth or PL locally-flat knots to PL knots that are not necessarily locally-flat. We introduce three families of generalized Alexander polynomials and study their properties. For knots with point singularities, we obtain a classification of these polynomials that is complete except for one special low-dimensional case. This classification extends existing classifications for PL locally-flat knots. For knots with higher-dimensional singularities, we further extend the necessary conditions on the invariants. We also construct several varieties of singular knots to demonstrate realizability of certain families of polynomials as generalized Alexander polynomials. These constructions, of independent interest, generalize known knot constructions such as frame spinning and twist spinning.
