In this work, the continuously controlled assembly map in algebraic K-theory, as developed by Carlsson and Pedersen, is proved to be a split injection for groups \Gamma that satisfy certain geometric conditions. The group \Gamma is allowed to have torsion, generalizing a result of Carlsson and Pedersen. Combining this with a result of John Moody, K_0(k\Gamma) is proved to be isomorphic to the colimit of K_0(kH) over the finite subgroups H of \Gamma, when \Gamma is a virtually polycyclic group and k is a field of characteristic zero.
