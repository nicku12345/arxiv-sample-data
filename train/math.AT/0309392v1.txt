We give an explicit formula for the rational category of an elliptic space whose minimal model has a homogeneous-length differential. We also show that for such a space, there are no gaps in the sequence of integers realized as the rational Toomer invariant of some cohomology class. With an additional hypothesis, we show a result from which we deduce the relation dim(H^*(X;Q)) >= 2 cat_0(X).
