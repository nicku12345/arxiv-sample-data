The notion of a cyclic map g: A -> X is a natural generalization of a Gottlieb element in pi_n(X). We investigate cyclic maps from a rational homotopy theory point of view. We show a number of results for rationalized cyclic maps which generalize well-known results on the rationalized Gottlieb groups.
