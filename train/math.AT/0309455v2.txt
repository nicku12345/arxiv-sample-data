We show that the complex C_\bullet X of rational simplicial chains on a compact and triangulated Poincar\'e duality space X of dimension d is an A_\infty coalgebra with \infty duality. This is the structure required for an A_\infty version of the cyclic Deligne conjecture. One corollary is that the shifted Hochschild cohomology HH^{\bullet+d} (C^\bullet X, C_\bullet X) of the cochain algebra C^\bullet X with values in C_\bullet X has a BV structure. This implies, if X is moreover simply connected, that the shifted homology H_{\bullet+d}LX of the free loop space admits a BV structure. An appendix by Dennis Sullivan gives a general local construction of \infty structures.
