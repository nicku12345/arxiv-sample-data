Let M be an irreducible projective variety over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero equipped with an action of a group \Gamma. Let E_G be a principal G--bundle over M, where G is a connected reductive algebraic group over k, equipped with a lift of the action of \Gamma on M. We give conditions for E_G to admit a \Gamma--equivariant reduction of structure group to H, where H \subset G is a Levi subgroup. We show that for E_G, there is a naturally associated conjugacy class of Levi subgroups of G. Given a Levi subgroup H in this conjugacy class, E_G admits a \Gamma--equivariant reduction of structure group to H, and furthermore, such a reduction is unique up to an automorphism of E_G that commutes with the action of \Gamma.
