Hom(G,H) is a polyhedral complex defined for any two undirected graphs G and H. This construction was introduced by Lov\'asz to give lower bounds for chromatic numbers of graphs. In this paper we initiate the study of the topological properties of this class of complexes. We prove that Hom(K_m,K_n) is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of (n-m)-dimensional spheres, and provide an enumeration formula for the number of the spheres. As a corollary we prove that if for some graph G, and integers m\geq 2 and k\geq -1, we have \varpi_1^k(\thom(K_m,G))\neq 0, then \chi(G)\geq k+m; here Z_2-action is induced by the swapping of two vertices in K_m, and \varpi_1 is the first Stiefel-Whitney class corresponding to this action. Furthermore, we prove that a fold in the first argument of Hom(G,H) induces a homotopy equivalence. It then follows that Hom(F,K_n) is homotopy equivalent to a direct product of (n-2)-dimensional spheres, while Hom(\bar{F},K_n) is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres, where F is an arbitrary forest and \bar{F} is its complement.
