Given an N-dimensional compact manifold M and a field \bk, F. Cohen and L. Taylor have constructed a spectral sequence, \cE(M,n,\bk), converging to the cohomology of the space of ordered configurations of n points in M. The symmetric group \Sigma_n acts on this spectral sequence giving a spectral sequence of \Sigma_n differential graded commutative algebras. Here, we provide an explicit description of the invariants algebra (E_1,d_1)^{\Sigma_n} of the first term of \cE(M,n,\Q). We apply this determination in two directions:   -- in the case of a complex projective manifold or of an odd dimensional manifold M, we obtain the cohomology algebra H^*(C_n(M);\Q) of the space of unordered configurations of n points in M (the concrete example of P^2(\C) is detailed),   -- we prove the degeneration of the spectral sequence formed of the \Sigma_n-invariants \cE(M,n,\Q)^{\Sigma_n} at level 2, for any manifold M.   These results use a transfer map and are also true with coefficients in a finite field \F_p with p>n.
