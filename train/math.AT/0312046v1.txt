In this work, the assembly map in L-theory for the family of finite subgroups is proven to be a split injection for a class of groups. Groups in this class, including virtually polycyclic groups, have universal spaces that satisfy certain geometric conditions. The proof follows the method developed by Carlsson-Pedersen to split the assembly map in the case of torsion free groups. Here, the continuously controlled techniques and results are extended to handle groups with torsion.
