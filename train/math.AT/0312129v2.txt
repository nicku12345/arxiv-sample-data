Building upon work of Y. Shalom we give a homological-algebra flavored definition of an induction map in group homology associated to a topological coupling. As an application we obtain estimates of the (co)homological dimension of groups G and H, where G embeds uniformly into H and the (co)homological dimension of G is finite. Another consequence of our results is that the Hirsch ranks of quasi-isometric solvable groups coincide. Further, it is shown that the real cohomology rings of quasi-isometric nilpotent groups are isomorphic as graded rings. On the analytic side, we apply the induction technique to Novikov-Shubin invariants of amenable groups, which can be seen as homological invariants, and show their invariance under quasi-isometry.
