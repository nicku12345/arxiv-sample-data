We introduce the notion of homotopy inner products for any cyclic quadratic Koszul operad \mathcal O, generalizing the construction already known for the associative operad. This is done by defining a colored operad \hat{\mathcal O}, which describes modules over \mathcal O with invariant inner products. We show that \hat{\mathcal O} satisfies Koszulness and identify algebras over a resolution of \hat{\mathcal O} in terms of derivations and module maps. An application to Poincar\'e duality on the chain level of a suitable topological space is given.
