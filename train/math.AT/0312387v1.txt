Let Y be the space obtained by attaching a finite-type wedge of cells to a simply-connected, finite-type CW-complex.   We introduce the free and semi-inert conditions on the attaching map which broadly generalize the previously studied inert condition. Under these conditions we determine H_*(\Omega Y;R) as an R-module and as an R-algebra respectively. Under a further condition we show that H_*(\Omega Y;R) is generated by Hurewicz images.   As an example we study an infinite family of spaces constructed using only semi-inert cell attachments.
