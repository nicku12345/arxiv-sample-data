We study the mod p cohomology of the classifying space of the projective unitary group PU(p). We first proof that old conjectures due to J.F. Adams, and Kono and Yagita about the structure of the mod p cohomology of classifying space of connected compact Lie groups held in the case of PU(p). Finally, we proof that the classifying space of the projective unitary group PU(p) is determined by its mod p cohomology as an unstable algebra over the Steenrod algebra for p>3, completing previous works for the cases p=2,3.
