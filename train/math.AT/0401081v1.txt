In this paper, I give a generalized analogue of the string topology results of Chas and Sullivan, and of Cohen and Jones. For a finite simplicial complex X and k \geq 1, I construct a spectrum Maps(S^k, X)^{S(X)}, and show that the corresponding chain complex is naturally homotopy equivalent to an algebra over the (k+1)-dimensional unframed little disk operad \mathcal{C}_{k+1}. I also prove Kontsevich's conjecture that the Quillen cohomology of a based \mathcal{C}_k-algebra (in the category of chain complexes) is equivalent to a shift of its Hochschild cohomology, as well as prove that the operad C_{\ast}\mathcal{C}_k is Koszul-dual to itself up to a shift in the derived category. This gives one a natural notion of (derived) Koszul dual C_{\ast}\mathcal{C}_k-algebras. I show that the cochain complex of X and the chain complex of \Omega^k X are Koszul dual to each other as C_{\ast}\mathcal{C}_k-algebras, and that the chain complex of Maps(S^k, X)^{S(X)} is naturally equivalent to their (equivalent) Hochschild cohomology in the category of C_{\ast}\mathcal{C}_k-algebras.
