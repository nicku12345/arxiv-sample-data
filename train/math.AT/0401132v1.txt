By now it is well known that there are two useful (objectwise or local) families of model structures on presheaves: the injective and projective. In fact, there is at least one more: the flasque. For some purposes, both the projective and the injective structure run into technical and annoying (but surmountable) difficulties for different reasons. The flasque model structure, which possesses a combination of the convenient properties of both structures, sometimes avoids these difficulties.
