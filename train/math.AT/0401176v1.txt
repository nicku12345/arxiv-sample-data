This is a survey of known algorithms in algebraic topology with a focus on finite simplicial complexes and, in particular, simplicial manifolds. Wherever possible an elementary approach is chosen. This way the text may also serve as a condensed but very basic introduction to the algebraic topology of simplicial manifolds.   This text will appear as a chapter in the forthcoming book "Triangulated Manifolds with Few Vertices" by Frank H. Lutz.
