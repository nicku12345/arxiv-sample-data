We study the cohomology properties of the singular foliation \F determined by an action \Phi \colon G \times M\to M where the abelian Lie group G preserves a riemannian metric on the compact manifold M. More precisely, we prove that the basic intersection cohomology \lau{\IH}{*}{\per{p}}{\mf} is finite dimensional and verifies the Poincar\'e Duality. This duality includes two well-known situations:   -- Poincar\'e Duality for basic cohomology (the action \Phi is almost free).   -- Poincar\'e Duality for intersection cohomology (the group G is compact and connected).
