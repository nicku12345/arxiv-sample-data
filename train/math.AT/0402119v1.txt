Thom-Pontrjagin constructions are used to give a computable necessary and sufficient condition when a homomorphism \phi : H^n(L;Z)\to H^n(M;Z) can be realized by a map f:M\to L of degree k for closed (n-1)-connected 2n-manifolds M and L, n>1. A corollary is that each (n-1)-connected 2n-manifold admits selfmaps of degree larger than 1, n>1.   In the most interesting case of dimension 4, with the additional surgery arguments we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a degree k map from a closed orientable 4-manifold M to a closed simply connected 4-manifold L in terms of their intersection forms, in particular there is a map f:M\to L of degree 1 if and only if the intersection form of L is isomorphic to a direct summand of that of M.
