To any two graphs G and H one can associate a cell complex Hom(G,H) by taking all graph multihomorphisms from G to H as cells.   In this paper we prove the Lovasz Conjecture which states that if Hom(C_{2r+1},G) is k-connected, then \chi(G)\geq k+4, where r,k\in Z, r\geq 1, k\geq -1, and C_{2r+1} denotes the cycle with 2r+1 vertices. The proof requires analysis of the complexes Hom(C_{2r+1},K_n). For even n, the obstructions to graph colorings are provided by the presence of torsion in H^*(Hom(C_{2r+1},K_n);Z). For odd n, the obstructions are expressed as vanishing of certain powers of Stiefel-Whitney characteristic classes of Hom(C_{2r+1},K_n), where the latter are viewed as \zz-spaces with the involution induced by the reflection of C_{2r+1}.
