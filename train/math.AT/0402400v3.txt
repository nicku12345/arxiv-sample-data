\noindent The simultaneous partition problems are classical problems of the combinatorial geometry which have the natural flavor of the equivariant topology. The k-fan partition problems have attracted a lot of attention \cite{Aki2000}, \cite{BaMa2001}, \cite{BaMa2002} and forced some hard concrete combinatorial calculations in the equivariant cohomology \cite% {Bl-Vr-Ziv}. These problems can be reduced, by a beautiful scheme of \cite% {BaMa2001}, to a \textquotedblright typical\textquotedblright question of the existence of a \mathbb{D}_{2n} equivariant map f:V_{2}(\mathbb{R}% ^{3})\to W_{n}-\cup \mathcal{A}(\alpha), where V_{2}(\mathbb{R}% ^{3}) is the space of all orthonormal 2-frames in \mathbb{R}^{3} and % W_{n}-\cup \mathcal{A}(\alpha) is the complement of the appropriate arrangement. We introduce the \textit{target extension scheme} which allow us to use the equivariant obstruction theory as a tool for proving that: for every two proper measures on the sphere S^{2}, and any \alpha =(a,a+b,b)\in \mathbb{R}_{>0}^{3}, there exists an \alpha -partition of theses measures by a 3-fan.   \noindent The significance of these results, among other, is that, beside negative results \cite{Bl-Vr-Ziv}, the equivariant obstruction theory can pull off some positive results, which were not attained by other means.
