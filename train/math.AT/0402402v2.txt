We partially solve the conjecture by A.Shumakovitch about torsion in the Khovanov homology of prime, non-split links in S^3. We give a size restriction on the Khovanov homology of almost alternating links. We relate the Khovanov homology of the connected sum of a link diagram and the Hopf link with the Khovanov homology of the diagram via a short exact sequence of homology which splits. Finally we show that our results can be adapted to reduced Khovanov homology and we show that there is a long exact sequence connecting reduced Khovanov homology with unreduced homology.
