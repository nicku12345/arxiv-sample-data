A classical result says that a free action of the circle \Bbb{S}^1 on a topological space X is geometrically classified by the orbit space B and by a cohomological class {H}^{^{2}}{(B,\Bbb{Z})}, the Euler class. When the action is not free we have a difficult open question:   \Pi : "Is the space X determined by the orbit space B and the Euler class?"   The main result of this work is a step towards the understanding of the above question in the category of unfolded pseudomanifolds. We prove that the orbit space B and the Euler class determine:   * the intersection cohomology of X,   * the real homotopy type of X.
