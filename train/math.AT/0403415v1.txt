We use the Steenrod algebra to study CH^*BG, the mod p Chow ring of the classifying space of G. We describe a localization property which relates a given G to its elementary abelian subgroups, and we study a number of particular cases, namely symmetric groups and Chevalley groups. It turns out that the Chow rings of these groups are completely determined by the abelian subgroups and their fusion.
