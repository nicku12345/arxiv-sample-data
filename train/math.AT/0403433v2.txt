A triangulation of a connected closed surface is called weakly regular if the action of its automorphism group on its vertices is transitive. A triangulation of a connected closed surface is called degree-regular if each of its vertices have the same degree. Clearly, a weakly regular triangulation is degree-regular. In 1999, Lutz has classified all the weakly regular triangulations on at most 15 vertices. In 2001, Datta and Nilakantan have classified all the degree-regular triangulations of closed surfaces on at most 11 vertices.   In this article, we have proved that any degree-regular triangulation of the torus is weakly regular. We have shown that there exists an n-vertex degree-regular triangulation of the Klein bottle if and only if n is a composite number \geq 9. We have constructed two distinct n-vertex weakly regular triangulations of the torus for each n \geq 12 and a (4m + 2)-vertex weakly regular triangulation of the Klein bottle for each m \geq 2. For 12 \leq n \leq 15, we have classified all the n-vertex degree-regular triangulations of the torus and the Klein bottle. There are exactly 19 such triangulations, 12 of which are triangulations of the torus and remaining 7 are triangulations of the Klein bottle. Among the last 7, only one is weakly regular.
