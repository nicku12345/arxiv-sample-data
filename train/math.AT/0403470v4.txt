For a knot K in S^3 and a regular representation \rho of its group G_K into SU(2) we construct a non abelian Reidemeister torsion on the first twisted cohomology group of the knot exterior. This non abelian Reidemeister torsion provides a volume form on the SU(2)-representation space of G_K. In another way, we construct according to Casson--or more precisely taking into account Lin's and Heusener's further works--a volume form on the SU(2)-representation space of G_K. Next, we compare these two apparently different points of view--the first by means of the Reidemeister torsion and the second defined ``a la Casson"--and finally prove that they define the same topological knot invariant.
