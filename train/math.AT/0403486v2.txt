Let M^n be a closed, connected n-manifold. Let \mtm denote the Thom spectrum of its stable normal bundle. A well known theorem of Atiyah states that \mtm is homotopy equivalent to the Spanier-Whitehead dual of M with a disjoint basepoint, M_+. This dual can be viewed as the function spectrum, F(M, S), where S is the sphere spectrum. F(M, S) has the structure of a commutative, symmetric ring spectrum in the sense of \cite{hss}, \cite{ship}. In this paper we prove that \mtm also has a natural, geometrically defined, structure of a commutative, symmetric ring spectrum, in such a way that the classical duality maps of Alexander, Spanier-Whitehead, and Atiyah define an equivalence of symmetric ring spectra, \alpha : \mtm \to F(M, S). We discuss applications of this to Hochshield cohomology representations of the Chas-Sullivan loop product in the homology of the free loop space of M.
