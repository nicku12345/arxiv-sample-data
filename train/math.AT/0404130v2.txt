For a stratified pseudomanifold X, we have the de Rham Theorem  \lau{\IH}{*}{\per{p}}{X} = \lau{\IH}{\per{t} - \per{p}}{*}{X},  for a perversity \per{p} verifying \per{0} \leq \per{p} \leq \per{t}, where \per{t} denotes the top perversity. We extend this result to any perversity \per{p}. In the direction cohomology \mapsto homology, we obtain the isomorphism  \lau{\IH}{*}{\per{p}}{X} = \lau{\IH}{\per{t} -\per{p}}{*}{X,\ib{X}{\per{p}}},  where  {\displaystyle \ib{X}{\per{p}} = \bigcup\_{S \preceq S\_{1} \atop \per{p} (S\_{1})< 0}S = \bigcup\_{\per{p} (S)< 0}\bar{S}.}  In the direction homology \mapsto cohomology, we obtain the isomorphism  \lau{\IH}{\per{p}}{*}{X}=\lau{\IH}{*}{\max (\per{0},\per{t} -\per{p})}{X}.  In our paper stratified pseudomanifolds with one-codimensional strata are allowed.
