The classical knot groups are the fundamental groups of the complements of smooth or piecewise-linear (PL) locally-flat knots. For PL knots that are not locally-flat, there is a pair of interesting groups to study: the fundamental group of the knot complement and that of the complement of the ``boundary knot'' that occurs around the singular set, the set of points at which the embedding is not locally-flat. If a knot has only point singularities, this is equivalent to studying the groups of a PL locally-flat disk knot and its boundary sphere knot; in this case, we obtain a complete classification of all such group pairs in dimension \geq 6. For more general knots, we also obtain complete classifications of these group pairs under certain restrictions on the singularities. Finally, we use spinning constructions to realize further examples of boundary knot groups.
