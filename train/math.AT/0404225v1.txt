In a previous paper the second author showed that if M is a pseudomanifold with complementarity other than the 6-vertex real projective plane and the 9-vertex complex projective plane, then M must have dimension \geq 6, and - in case of equality - M must have exactly 12 vertices. In this paper we prove that such a 6-dimensional pseudomanifold does not exist. On the way to proving our main result we also prove that all combinatorial triangulations of the 4-sphere with at most 10 vertices are combinatorial 4-spheres.
