This work deals with Adem relations in the Dyer-Lashof algebra from a modular invariant point of view. The main result is to provide an algorithm which has two effects: Firstly, to calculate the hom-dual of an element in the Dyer-Lashof algebra; and secondly, to find the image of a non-admissible element after applying Adem relations. The advantage of our method is that one has to deal with polynomials instead of homology operations. A moderate explanation of the complexity of Adem relations is given.
