Symplectic torus bundles \xi:T^{2}\to E\to B are classified by the second cohomology group of B with local coefficients H_{1}(T^{2}). For B a compact, orientable surface, the main theorem of this paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition on the cohomology class corresponding to \xi for E to admit a symplectic structure compatible with the symplectic bundle structure of \xi : namely, that it be a torsion class. The proof is based on a group-extension-theoretic construction of J. Huebschmann (Sur les premieres differentielles de la suite spectrale cohomologique d'une extension de groupes, C.R. Acad. Sc. Paris, Serie A, tome 285, 28 novembre 1977, 929-931). A key ingredient is the notion of fibrewise-localization.
