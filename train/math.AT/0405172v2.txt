Let R be a local ring and A a connected differential graded algebra over R which is free as a graded R-module. Using homological perturbation theory techniques, we construct a minimal free multi model for A having properties similar to that of an ordinary minimal model over a field; in particular the model is unique up to isomorphism of multialgebras. The attribute multi refers to the category of multicomplexes.
