we study the exponential map for A_n = R^2^n, the Cayley_Dickson algebras for n bigher than 1,wich generalize the Complex exponential map to Quaternions,Octonions and so forth. As application,we show that the self-map of the unit sphere in A_n, S^(2^n)-1,given by taking k-powers has topological degree k for k an integer number,from this we derive a suitable "Fundamental theorem of algebra" for A_n for n bigher than 1.
