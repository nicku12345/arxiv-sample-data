Let B_n denote the classical braid group on n strands and let the {\em mixed braid group} B_{m,n} be the subgroup of B_{m+n} comprising braids for which the first m strands form the identity braid. Let B_{m,\infty}=\cup_nB_{m,n}. We will describe explicit algebraic moves on B_{m,\infty} such that equivalence classes under these moves classify oriented links up to isotopy in a link complement or in a closed, connected, oriented 3--manifold. The moves depend on a fixed link representing the manifold in S^3. More precisely, for link complements the moves are: the two familiar moves of the classical Markov equivalence together with {\em `twisted' conjugation} by certain loops a_i. This means premultiplication by {a_i}^{-1} and postmultiplication by a `combed' version of a_i. For closed 3--manifolds there is an additional set of {\it `combed' band moves} which correspond to sliding moves over the surgery link. The main tool in the proofs is the one-move Markov Theorem using {\it L--moves} \cite{LR} (adding in-box crossings). The resulting algebraic classification is a direct extension of the classical Markov Theorem that classifies links in S^3 up to isotopy, and potentially leads to powerful new link invariants, which have been explored in special cases by the first author. It also provides a controlled range of isotopy moves, useful for studying skein modules of 3--manifolds.
