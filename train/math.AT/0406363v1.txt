In recent work by Clarke, Crossley and the second author, various algebras of stable degree zero operations in p-local K-theory were described explicitly. The elements are certain infinite sums of Adams operations. Here we show how to make sense of the same expressions for p-local cobordism and for BP, thus identifying the "Adams subalgebra" of the algebras of operations. We prove that the Adams subalgebra is the centre of the ring of degree zero operations.
