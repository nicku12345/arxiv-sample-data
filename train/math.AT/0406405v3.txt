A simply connected topological space X has homotopy Lie algebra \pi_*(\Omega X) \tensor \Q. Following Quillen, there is a connected differential graded free Lie algebra (dgL) called a Lie model, which determines the rational homotopy type of X, and whose homology is isomorphic to the homotopy Lie algebra. We show that such a Lie model can be replaced with one that has a special property we call separated. The homology of a separated dgL has a particular form which lends itself to calculations.
