A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is said to be spacelike Jordan IP if the Jordan normal form of the skew-symmetric curvature operator depends upon the point of the manifold, but not upon the particular spacelike 2-plane in the tangent bundle at that point. We use methods of algebraic topology to classify connected spacelike Jordan IP pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (p,q), where q\ge 11, p\le \frac{q-6}{4} and where the set \{q, . . ., q+p\} does not contain a power of 2.
