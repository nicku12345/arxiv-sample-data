Within its traditional range of perversity parameters, intersection cohomology is a topological invariant of pseudomanifolds. This is no longer true once one allows superperversities, in which case intersection cohomology may depend on the choice of the stratification by which it is defined. Topological invariance also does not hold if one allows stratifications with codimension one strata. Nonetheless, both errant situations arise in important situations, the former in the Cappell-Shaneson superduality theorem and the latter in any discussion of pseudomanifold bordism. We show that while full invariance of intersection cohomology under restratification does not hold in this generality, it does hold up to restratifications that fix the the top stratum.
