In the present paper we give a new method for converting virtual knots and links to virtual braids. Indeed the braiding method given in this paper is quite general, and applies to all the categories in which braiding can be accomplished. We give a unifying topological interpretation of virtuals and flats (virtual strings) and their isotopies via ribbon surfaces and abstract link diagrams. We also give reduced presentations for the virtual braid group, the flat virtual braid group, the welded braid group and several other categories of braids. The paper includes a discussion of the topological intepretation of the welded braid group in terms of tubes embedded in four-space. A sequel to this paper will give a new proof of a Markov Theorem for virtual braids (and related categories) via the L-move (a technique pioneered for classical braids and braids in three-manifolds by the second author).
