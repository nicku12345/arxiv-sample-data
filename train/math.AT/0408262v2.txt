In this paper we study implications of folds in both parameters of Lov\'asz' Hom(-,-) complexes. There is an important connection between the topological properties of these complexes and lower bounds for chromatic numbers. We give a very short and conceptual proof of the fact that if G-v is a fold of G, then Bd(Hom(G,H)) collapses onto Bd Hom(G-v,H), whereas Hom(H,G) collapses onto Hom(H,G-v).   We also give an easy inductive proof of the only nonelementary fact which we use for our arguments: if \phi is a closure operator on P, then \Delta(P) collapses onto \Delta(\phi(P)).
