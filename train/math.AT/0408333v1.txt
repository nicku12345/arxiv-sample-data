There are two natural candidates for the group of relative Cheeger-Simons differential characters. The first directly extends the work of Cheeger and Simons and the second extends the description given by Hopkins and Singer of the Cheeger-Simons group as the homology of a certain cochain complex. We discuss both approaches and relate the two relative groups.
