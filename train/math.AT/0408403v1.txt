Bo Ju Jiang applied Neilsen theory to the study of periodic orbits of a homeomorphism. His method employs a certain loop in the mapping torus of the homeomorphism. Our interest concerns the persistence of periodic orbits in parameterized families of homeomorphisms. This leads us to consider fibre bundles and equivariant maps, which gives us a nice point of view.
