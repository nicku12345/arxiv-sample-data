Let V be a degree d, reduced hypersurface in \mathbb{CP}^{n+1}, n \geq 1, and fix a generic hyperplane, H. Denote by \mathcal{U} the (affine) hypersurface complement, \mathbb{CP}^{n+1}- V \cup H, and let \mathcal{U}^c be the infinite cyclic covering of \mathcal{U} corresponding to the kernel of the linking number homomorphism. Using intersection homology theory, we give a new construction of the Alexander modules H_i(\mathcal{U}^c;\mathbb{Q}) of the hypersurface complement and show that, if i \leq n, these are torsion over the ring of rational Laurent polynomials. We also obtain obstructions on the associated global polynomials. Their zeros are roots of unity of order d and are entirely determined by the local topological information encoded by the link pairs of singular strata of a stratification of the pair (\mathbb{CP}^{n+1},V). As an application, we give obstructions on the eigenvalues of monodromy operators associated to the Milnor fibre of a projective hypersurface arrangement.
