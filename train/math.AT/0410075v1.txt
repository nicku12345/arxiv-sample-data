We describe a collection of higher homotopy operations which determine the rational homotopy type of a simply-connected space X. These are described in terms of simplicial resolutions of successive approximations (L^k,\alpha} to the Quillen DGL model for X. The operations lie in suitable cohomology groups H^*{L^{(k,\alpha)}; \pi_* X\otimes Q} of these DGLs. To facilitate the recovery of an integral version of the operations from the rational description, we also define a differential graded non-associative algebra model for rational spaces.
