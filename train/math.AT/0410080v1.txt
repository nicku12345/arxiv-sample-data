The moduli spaces refered to are topological spaces whose path components parametrize homotopy types. Such objects have been studied in two separate contexts: rational homotopy types, in the work of several authors in the late 1970's; and general homotopy types, in the work of Dwyer-Kan and their collaborators. We here explain the two approaches, and show how they may be related to each other.
