The main result of this paper is a proof of the following conjecture of Babson & Kozlov:   Theorem. Let G be a graph of maximal valency d, then the complex Hom(G,K_n) is at least (n-d-2)-connected.   Here Hom(-,-) denotes the polyhedral complex introduced by Lov\'asz to study the topological lower bounds for chromatic numbers of graphs.   We will also prove, as a corollary to the main theorem, that the complex Hom(C_{2r+1},K_n) is (n-4)-connected, for n\geq 3.
