This paper is based on talks I gave in Nagoya and Kinosaki in August of 2003. I survey, from my own perspective, Goodwillie's work on towers associated to continuous functors between topological model categories, and then include a discussion of applications to periodic homotopy as in my work and the work of Arone-Mahowald.
