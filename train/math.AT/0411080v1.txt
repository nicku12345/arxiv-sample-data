In this paper we study the topology of the cobordism category of open and closed strings. This is a 2-category in which the objects are compact one-manifolds whose boundary components are labeled by an indexing set (the set of "D-branes"), the 1-morphisms are cobordisms of manifolds with boundary, and the 2-morphisms are diffeomorphisms of the surface cobordisms. Our methods and techniques are direct generalizations of those used by U. Tillmann in her study of the category of closed strings. We input the striking theorem of Madsen and Weiss regarding the topology of the stable mapping class group to identify the homotopy type of the geometric realization of the category of open and closed strings as an infinite loop space.
