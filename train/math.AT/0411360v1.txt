It is known algebraically that any abelian group is a direct sum of a divisible group and a reduced group (See Theorem 21.3 of \cite{Fuchs:abelian-group}). In this paper, conditions to split off rational parts in homotopy types from a given space are studied in terms of a variant of Hurewicz map, say \bar{\rho} : [S_{\Q}^{n},X] \to H_n(X;\Z) and generalized Gottlieb groups. This yields decomposition theorems on rational homotopy types of Hopf spaces, T-spaces and Gottlieb spaces, which has been known in various situations, especially for spaces with finiteness conditions.
