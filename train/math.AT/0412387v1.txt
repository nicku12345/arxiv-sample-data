Generalizing F-nilpotent completion for a ring spectrum F we first define the notion of completion with respect to a thick subcategory in a monogenic stable homotopy category. Specializing this to the thick subcategory generated by F-injectives gives an injective completion functor. This is the completion functor adapted to the modified Adams spectral sequence, which uses absolute instead of relative injective resolutions. Finally we show, that both constructions coincide for suitable ring spectra.
