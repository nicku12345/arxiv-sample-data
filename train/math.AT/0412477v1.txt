In \cite{baker-ozel}, by using Fredholm index we developed a version of Quillen's geometric cobordism theory for infinite dimensional Hilbert manifolds. This cobordism theory has a graded group structure under topological union operation and has push-forward maps for complex orientable Fredholm maps. In this work, by using Quinn's Transversality Theorem \cite{Quinn}, it will be shown that this cobordism theory has a graded ring structure under transversal intersection operation and has pull-back maps for smooth maps. It will be shown that the Thom isomorphism in this theory will be satisfied for finite dimensional vector bundles over separable Hilbert manifolds and the projection formula for Gysin maps will be proved. After we discuss the relation between this theory and classical cobordism, we describe some applications to the complex cobordism of flag varieties of loop groups and we do some calculations.
