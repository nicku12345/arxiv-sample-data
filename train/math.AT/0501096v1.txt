Let \bar{M} be a manifold with boundary Y which is the total space of a fibre bundle, and is defined by the vanishing of a boundary defining function, x. We prove L^2 Hodge and signature theorems for M endowed with a metric of the form dx^2 + x^{2c} h + k, where k is the lift to Y of the metric on the base of the fibre bundle, h is a two form on Y which restricts to a metric on each fibre, and 0 \leq c \leq 1. These metrics interpolate between the case when c=0, in which case the metric near the boundary is a cylinder, and the case where c=1, in which case the metric near the boundary is that of a cone bundle over the base of the boundary fibration. We show that the L^2 Hodge theorems for the cohomologies given by the maximal and minimal extensions of d with respect to these metrics and the L^2 signature theorem for the image of the minimal cohomology in the maximal cohomology interpolate between known results for L^2 Hodge and signature theorems for cylindrical and cone bundle type metrics. In particular, the Hodge theorems all relate the related spaces of L^2 harmonic forms to intersection cohomology of varying perversities for X, the space formed from \bar{M} by collapsing the fibres of Y at the boundary. The signature theorem involves variations on the \tau invariant described by Dai.
