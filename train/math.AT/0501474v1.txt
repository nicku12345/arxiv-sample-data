Let G be a closed subgroup of G_n, the extended Morava stabilizer group. Let E_n be the Lubin-Tate spectrum, let X be an arbitrary spectrum with trivial G-action, and define E^(X) to be L_K(n)(E_n ^ X). We prove that E^(X) is a continuous G-spectrum with a G-homotopy fixed point spectrum, defined with respect to the continuous action. Also, we construct a descent spectral sequence whose abutment is the homotopy groups of the G-homotopy fixed point spectrum of E^(X). We show that the homotopy fixed points of E^(X) come from the K(n)-localization of the homotopy fixed points of the spectrum (F_n ^ X).
