We refine the Whitehead torsion of a chain equivalence of finite chain complexes in an additive category \bA from an element of \widetilde{K}^{iso}_1(\bA) to an element of the absolute group K_1^{iso}(\bA). We apply this invariant to symmetric Poincar\'e complexes and identify it in terms of more traditional invariants. In the companion paper [1] (joint with Ian Hambleton and Andrew Ranicki) this new invariant is applied to obtain the multiplicativity of the signature of fibre bundles mod 4.
