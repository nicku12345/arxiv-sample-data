We express the signature modulo 4 of a closed, oriented, 4k-dimensional PL manifold as a linear combination of its Euler characteristic and the new absolute torsion invariant defined in Korzeniewski [11]. Let F \to E \to B be a PL fibre bundle, where F, E and B are closed, connected, and compatibly oriented PL manifolds. We give a formula for the absolute torsion of the total space E in terms of the absolute torsion of the base and fibre, and then combine these two results to prove that the signature of E is congruent modulo 4 to the product of the signatures of F and B.
