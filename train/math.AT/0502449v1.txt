The results of the paper concern the topological structure of complete riemannian manifolds with cyclic holonomy groups and low-dimensional orientable complete flat manifolds. We also discuss related results such as the affine classification of orientable complete flat 4-manifolds, an algebraic criterion of an affine equivalence, the relationship between holonomy homomorphisms and some algebraic and geometric invariants.
