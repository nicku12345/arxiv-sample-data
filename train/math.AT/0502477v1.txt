A realization of a virtual link diagram is obtained by choosing over/under markings for each virtual crossing. Any realization can also be obtained from some representation of the virtual link. (A representation of a virtual link is a link diagram on an oriented 2-dimensional surface.) We prove that if a minimal genus representation meets certain criteria then there is a minimal genus representation resulting in a knotted realization.
