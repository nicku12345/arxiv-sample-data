For the space of long knots in R^3, Vassiliev's theory defines the so called finite order cocycles. Zero degree cocycles are finite type knot invariants. The first non-trivial cocycle of positive dimension in the space of long knots has dimension one and order three. We apply Vassiliev's combinatorial formula, and find the value mod 2 of this cocycle on the 1-cycles that are obtained by dragging knots one along the other or by rotating around a fixed line.
