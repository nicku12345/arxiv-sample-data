An old result of the first author and David Lieberman says that if a compact Kaehler manifold X admits a holomorphic vector field V having at least one zero, then the Dolbeault cohomology algebra H^*(X, \Omega^*) of X is isomorphic with the bigraded algebra associated to a certain filtered graded ring. If V has isolated zeros this is the graded algebra associated to a certain filtration of the coordinate ring of the scheme Z defined by zero(V). The purpose of this note is to show that if V is generated by a torus action then equivariant Dolbeault cohomology can be used to give direct geometric proofs of the above result. What is particularly interesting is the picture obtained when zero(V) has positive dimension.
