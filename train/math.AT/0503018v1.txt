Bestvina and Mess [BM] proved a remarkable formula for torsion free hyperbolic groups  \dim_L\partial\Gamma=cd_L\Gamma-1  connecting the cohomological dimension of a group \Gamma with the cohomological dimension of its boundary \partial\Gamma. In [Be] Bestvina introduced a notion of \sZ-structure on a discrete group and noticed that his formula holds true for all torsion free groups with \sZ-structure. Bestvina's notion of \sZ-structure can be extended to groups containing torsion by replacing the covering space action in the definition by the geometric action. Though the Bestvina-Mess formula trivially is not valid for groups with torsion, we show that it still holds in the following modified form: {\it The cohomological dimension of a \sZ-boundary of a group \Gamma equals its global cohomological dimension for every PID L as the coefficient group}  \dim_L\partial\Gamma=gcd_L(\partial\Gamma).  Using this formula we show that the cohomological dimension of the boundary \dim_{L}\partial\Gamma is a quasi-isometry invariant of a group.
