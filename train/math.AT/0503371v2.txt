We first formulate a general scheme for the classification of 2-compact groups in terms of maximal torus normalizer pairs. Applying this scheme, we show that all connected and some non-connected 2-compact groups are N-determined. We also compute automorphism groups in many cases. As an application we confirm the splitting conjecture formulated by Dwyer and Wilkerson.
