We introduce the notion of nonevasive reduction, and show that for any monotone poset map \phi:P\to P, the simplicial complex \Delta(P) {\tt NE}-reduces to \Delta(Q), for any Q\supseteq{\text{\rm Fix}}\phi.   As a corollary, we prove that for any order-preserving map \phi:P\to P satisfying \phi(x)\geq x, for any x\in P, the simplicial complex \Delta(P) collapses to \Delta(\phi(P)). We also obtain a generalization of Crapo's closure theorem.
