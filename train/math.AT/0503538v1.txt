In this thesis we consider two constructions generalizing the classical Arf invariant. In the first construction an \epsilon-symmetric quadratic form over a ring with involution R is lifted to an \epsilon(1+T)-symmetric quadratic form over the ring of formal power series R[[T]] with involution mapping T to \frac{-T}{1+T}. The discriminant of this form can be viewed as the classical Arf invariant \omega_1 of the original form, and the Hasse-Witt invariant of this form gives rise to a `secondary' Arf invariant \omega_2, which is defined on the kernel of \omega_1. The second construction yields an invariant \Upsilon which is defined on quadratic forms for which the underlying symmetric form is standard. It takes values in a quotient of quaternionic homology HQ_1(R) which is defined using natural operations on HQ_1. In the case of a commutative ring \Upsilon agrees with (\omega_1,\omega_2). The invariant \Upsilon is well suited for computations. In particular we prove that it is faithful if R is the group ring over GF(2) of a group with two ends.
