A discrete group G has periodic cohomology over R if there is an element in a cohomology group, cup product with which induces an isomorphism in cohomology after a certain dimension. Adem and Smith showed if R = Z, then this condition is equivalent to the existence of a finite dimensional free-G-CW- complex homotopy equivalent to a sphere. It has been conjectured by Olympia Talelli, that if G is also torsion-free then it must have finite cohomological di- mension. In this paper we use the implied condition of jump cohomology over R to prove the conjecture for HF-groups and solvable groups. We also find necessary conditions for free and proper group actions on finite dimensional complexes homotopy equivalent to closed, orientable manifolds.
