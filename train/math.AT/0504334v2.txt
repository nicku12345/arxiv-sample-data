Given any model category, or more generally any category with weak equivalences, its simplicial localization is a simplicial category which can rightfully be called the "homotopy theory" of the model category. There is a model category structure on the category of simplicial categories, so taking its simplicial localization yields a "homotopy theory of homotopy theories." In this paper we show that there are two different categories of diagrams of simplicial sets, each equipped with an appropriate definition of weak equivalence, such that the resulting homotopy theories are each equivalent to the homotopy theory arising from the model category structure on simplicial categories. Thus, any of these three categories with their respective weak equivalences could be considered a model for the homotopy theory of homotopy theories. One of them in particular, Rezk's complete Segal space model category structure on the category of simplicial spaces, is much more convenient from the perspective of making calculations and therefore obtaining information about a given homotopy theory.
