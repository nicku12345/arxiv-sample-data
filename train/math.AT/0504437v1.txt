The A(\inft)-algebra structure in homology of a DG-algebra is constructed. This structure is unique up to isomorphism of A(\infty) algebras. Connection of this structure with Massey products is indicated. The notion of A(\infty)-module over an A(\infty)-algebra is introduced and such a structure is constructed in homology of a DG-modules over a DG-algebra. The theory of twisted tensor products is generalized from the case of DG-algebras to the case of A(\infty)-algebras. These algebraic results are used to describe homology of classifying spaces, cohomology of loop spaces, and homology of fibre bundles.
