Lie groupoids generalize transformation groups, and so provide a natural language for studying orbifolds and other noncommutative geometries. In this paper, we investigate a connection between orbifolds and equivariant stable homotopy theory using such groupoids. A different sort of twisted sector, along with a classical theorem of tom Dieck, allows for a natural definition of stable orbifold homotopy groups, and motivates defining extended unstable orbifold homotopy groups generalizing previous definitions.
