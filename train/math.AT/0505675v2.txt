For a riemannian foliation \mathcal{F} on a closed manifold M, it is known that \mathcal{F} is taut (i.e. the leaves are minimal submanifolds) if and only if the (tautness) class defined by the mean curvature form \kappa_\mu (relatively to a suitable riemannian metric \mu) is zero. In the transversally orientable case, tautness is equivalent to the non-vanishing of the top basic cohomology group H^{^{n}}(M/\mathcal{F}), where n = \codim \mathcal{F}. By the Poincar\'e Duality, this last condition is equivalent to the non-vanishing of the basic twisted cohomology group H^{^{0}}_{_{\kappa_\mu}}(M/\mathcal{F}), when M is oriented. When M is not compact, the tautness class is not even defined in general. In this work, we recover the previous study and results for a particular case of riemannian foliations on non compact manifolds: the regular part of a singular riemannian foliation on a compact manifold (CERF).
