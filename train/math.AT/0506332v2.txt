Profinite etale cobordism is a cohomology theory for smooth schemes of finite type over a field. Using an idea of Friedlander, it is constructed as an etale topological analog of the algebraic cobordism theories of Voevodsky and Levine-Morel. With finite coefficients, profinite etale cobordism has a converging Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence starting from etale cohomology. There are interesting comparison maps from algebraic to profinite etale cobordism. We conjecture that algebraic and etale cobordism with finite coefficients are isomorphic after inverting a Bott element. For the development of the theory, we construct a stable category of profinite spectra and an etale realization of the category of stable motivic spectra over a field.
