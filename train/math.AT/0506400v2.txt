We exhibit a finitely generated group \M whose rational homology is isomorphic to the rational stable homology of the mapping class group. It is defined as a mapping class group associated to a surface \su of infinite genus, and contains all the pure mapping class groups of compact surfaces of genus g with n boundary components, for any g\geq 0 and n>0. We construct a representation of \M into the restricted symplectic group {\rm Sp_{res}}({\cal H}_r) of the real Hilbert space generated by the homology classes of non-separating circles on \su, which generalizes the classical symplectic representation of the mapping class groups. Moreover, we show that the first universal Chern class in H^2(\M,\Z) is the pull-back of the Pressley-Segal class on the restricted linear group {\rm GL_{res}}({\cal H}) via the inclusion {\rm Sp_{res}}({\cal H}_r)\subset {\rm GL_{res}}({\cal H}).
