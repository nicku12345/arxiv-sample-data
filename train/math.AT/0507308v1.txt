In this paper, we briefly review some of the known results concerning the cohomological structures of the mapping class group of surfaces, the outer automorphism group of free groups, the diffeomorphism group of surfaces as well as various subgroups of them such as the Torelli group, the IA outer automorphism group of free groups, the symplectomorphism group of surfaces.   Based on these, we present several conjectures and problems concerning the cohomology of these groups. We are particularly interested in the possible interplays between these cohomology groups rather than merely the structures of individual groups. It turns out that, we have to include, in our considerations, two other groups which contain the mapping class group as their core subgroups and whose structures seem to be deeply related to that of the mapping class group. They are the arithmetic mapping class group and the group of homology cobordism classes of homology cylinders.
