We compute CH^*BG_2 and CH^*BSpin_7, using in particular the stratification method introduced by Vezzosi. We also give some information on the Chow rings of the finite groups G_2(q).   This new version includes an appendix, which will be published on its own as an addendum. It explains how one can use our results to produce a counter-example to the conjecture, due to Totaro, which predicted that the Chow ring of a finite group was generated by transfers of Chern classes.
