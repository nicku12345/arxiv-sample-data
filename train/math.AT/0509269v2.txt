Let A be a unital commutative Banach algebra with maximal ideal space X. We determine the rational H-type of the group GL_n (A) of invertible n by n matrices with coefficients in A, in terms of the rational cohomology of X. We also address an old problem of J. L. Taylor. Let Lc_n (A) denote the space of "last columns" of GL_n (A). For n > 1 + s/2, we construct a natural isomorphism from the rational Cech cohomology group H^s (X; Q) to the rational homotopy group \pi_{2 n - 1 - s} (Lc_n (A)) \otimes Q, which shows that the rational cohomology groups of X are determined by a topological invariant associated to A. As part of our analysis, we determine the rational H-type of certain gauge groups F (X, G) for G a Lie group or, more generally, a rational H-space.
