The work treats smoothing and dispersive properties of solutions to the Schrodinger equation with magnetic potential. Under suitable smallness assumption on the potential involving scale invariant norms we prove smoothing - Strichartz estimate for the corresponding Cauchy problem. An application that guarantees absence of pure point spectrum of the corresponding perturbed Laplace operator is discussed too.
