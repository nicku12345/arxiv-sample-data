For each composite number n\ne 2^k, there does not exist a single connected closed (n+1)-manifold such that any smooth, simply-connected, closed n-manifold can be topologically flat embedded into it. There is a single connected closed 5-manifold W such that any simply-connected, 4-manifold M can be topologically flat embedded into W if M is either closed and indefinite, or compact and with non-empty boundary.
