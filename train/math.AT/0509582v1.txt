A countable CW complex K is quasi-finite (as defined by A.Karasev) if for every finite subcomplex M of K there is a finite subcomplex e(M) such that any map f:A\to M, where A is closed in a separable metric space X satisfying X\tau K, has an extension g:X\to e(M). Levin's results imply that none of the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(G,2) is quasi-finite if G\ne 0. In this paper we discuss quasi-finiteness of all Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. More generally, we deal with CW complexes with finitely many nonzero Postnikov invariants.   Here are the main results of the paper: Suppose K is a countable CW complex with finitely many nonzero Postnikov invariants. If \pi_1(K) is a locally finite group and K is quasi-finite, then K is acyclic. Suppose K is a countable non-contractible CW complex with finitely many nonzero Postnikov invariants. If \pi_1(K) is nilpotent and K is quasi-finite, then K is extensionally equivalent to S^1.
