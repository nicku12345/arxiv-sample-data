It is proved that for a product action of (\mathbb Z_p)^k on a product of (mod p) homology spheres N^{n_1}\times...\times N^{n_k}, where all n_i's are assumed to be odd if p is odd, and any continuous map f\colon N^{n_1}\times...\times N^{n_k}\to \mathbb R^m the set A(f)=\{x\in N^{n_1}\times...\times N^{n_k}| f(x)=f(gx) \forall g\in(\mathbb Z_p)^k\} has dimension at least n_1+...+n_k-m(p^k-1), provided n_i\ge mp^{i-1}(p-1) for all i (1\le i\le k). Moreover, if n_i\ge mp^{k-1}(p-1) for all i(1\le i\le k) then the free action \mu can be assumed arbitrary.
