The contribution of this PhD thesis is to construct for each vector bundle \xi an orthogonal ring spectrum R, weakly equivalent to S[\Omega M], together with an involution on R. On the homotopy groups \pi_*S[\Omega M] our involution corresponds to parallel transportation in \xi, and reversing loops in M. The main result is theorem 4.3.26. The orthogonal ring spectrum R with involution is intended as input for LA, K, TC and THH, the ultimate goal is to compute homotopy groups of automorphism groups. We take a first step in this direction by considering the definition and a few basic properties of TC(L) and THH(L) for arbitrary orthogonal ring spectra L (with involution).
