In this paper we explore the possibility of defining p-local finite groups in terms of transfer properties of their classifying spaces. More precisely, we consider the question posed by Haynes Miller, whether an equivalent theory can be obtained by studying triples (f,t,X), where X is a p-complete, nilpotent space with finite fundamental group, f is a map from the classifying space of a finite p-group, and t is a stable retraction of f satisfying Frobenius reciprocity at the level of stable homotopy. We refer to t as a retractive transfer of f and to (f,t,X) as a retractive transfer triple over S.   In the case where S is elementary abelian, we answer this question in the affirmative by showing that a retractive transfer triple (f,t,X) over S does indeed induce a p-local finite group over S with X as its classifying space.   Conversely, we show that for a p-local finite group over any finite p-group S, the natural inclusion of BS into the classifying space of the p-local finite group has a retractive transfer t, making the triple consisting of the inclusion, the retractive transfer and the classifying space of the p-local finite group a retractive transfer triple over S. This also requires a proof, obtained jointly with Ran Levi, that the classifying space of a p-local finite group is a nilpotent space, which is of independent interest.
