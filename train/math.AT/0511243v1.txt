The aim of this note is to improve upon our earlier result which translates Weyl's (curvature) formulation of Chern character of a smooth vector bundle into the language of residues. The dualized Chern character is the functional on smooth differential forms on M. In our previous paper, this functional has been expressed as a sum of certain residues in the spirit of the Local Index formula due to Connes and Moscovici. The present note provides a stronger and more effective formulation.
