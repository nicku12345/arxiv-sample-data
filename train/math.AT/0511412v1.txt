We discuss the Bousfield localization L_E X for any spectrum E and any HR-module X, where R is a ring with unit. Due to the splitting property of HR-modules, it is enough to study the localization of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra. Using general results about stable f-localizations, we give a method to compute the localization of an Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum L_E HG for any spectrum E and any abelian group G. We describe L_E HG explicitly when G is one of the following: finitely generated abelian groups, p-adic integers, Pr\"ufer groups, and subrings of the rationals. The results depend basically on the E-acyclicity patterns of the spectrum H\Q and the spectrum H\Z/p for each prime p.
