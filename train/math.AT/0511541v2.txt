We prove a finiteness result for the \partial-patterned guts decomposition of all 3-manifolds obtained by splitting a given orientable, irreducible and \partial-irreducible 3-manifold along a closed incompressible surface. Then using the Thurston norm, we deduce that the JSJ-pieces of all 3-manifolds dominated by a given compact 3-manifold belong, up to homeomorphism, to a finite collection of compact 3-manifolds. We show also that any closed orientable 3-manifold dominates only finitely many integral homology spheres and any compact 3-manifolds orientable 3-manifold dominates only finitely many exterior of knots in S^3.
