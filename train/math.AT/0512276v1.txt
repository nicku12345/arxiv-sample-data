Let M be a closed oriented d-dimensionnal manifold and let LM be the space of free loops on M. In this paper, we give a geometrical interpretation of the loop coproduct and we study it's compatibility with the Serre spectral sequence associated to the fibration \Omega M \to LM \to M. Then, we show that the spectral sequence associated to the free loop fibration LN \to LX \to LM of some Serre fibration N \to X \to M is a spectral sequence of Frobenius algebra.
