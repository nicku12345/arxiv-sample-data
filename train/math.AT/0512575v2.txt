Generalising Segal's approach to 1-fold loop spaces, the homotopy theory of n-fold loop spaces is shown to be equivalent to the homotopy theory of reduced \Theta_n-spaces, where \Theta_n is an iterated wreath product of the simplex category \Delta. A sequence of functors from \Theta_n to \Gamma allows for an alternative description of the Segal-spectrum associated to a \Gamma-space. In particular, each Eilenberg-MacLane space K(\pi,n) has a canonical reduced \Theta_n-set model.
