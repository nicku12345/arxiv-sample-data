The stabilization of Hochschild homology of commutative algebras is Gamma homology. We describe a cyclic variant of Gamma homology and prove that the associated analogue of Connes' periodicity sequence becomes almost trivial, because the cyclic version coincides with the ordinary version from homological degree two on. We offer an alternative explanation for this by proving that the B-operator followed by the stabilization map is trivial from degree one on.
