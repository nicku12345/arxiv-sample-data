In recent work (math/0507514) by Etingof, Henriques, Kamnitzer, and the author, a presentation and explicit basis was given for the rational cohomology of the real locus \bar{M_{0,n}}(\RR) of the moduli space of stable genus 0 curves with n marked points. We determine the graded character of the action of S_n on this space (induced by permutations of the marked points), both in the form of a plethystic formula for the cycle index, and as an explicit product formula for the value of the character on a given cycle type.
