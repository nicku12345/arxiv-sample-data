We verify the Becker-Shultz axioms characterizing the Becker-Gottlieb transfer \tau for the composite of the algebraic K-theory transfer of any perfect fibration followed by the trace map. As a consequence, for any compact ANR fibration (those considered by Becker-Shultz), \tau is homotopy equivalent to the composite of the algebraic K-theory transfer followed by the trace map. Furthermore, if these same axioms (including strong additivity) could be shown to extend to characterizing \tau for arbitrary perfect fibrations, our homotopy equivalence extends to the case of arbitrary perfect fibrations as well.
