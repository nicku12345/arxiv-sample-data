We consider two pairs: the standard unknotted n-sphere in S^{n+2}, and the product of two p-spheres trivially embedded in S^{2p+2}, and study orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of these pairs. Pseudo-isotopy classes of such diffeomorphisms form subgroups of the mapping class groups of S^n and S^p\times S^p respectively and we determine the algebraic structure of such subgroups when n>4 and p>1.
