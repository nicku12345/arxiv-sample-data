We define the notion of an additive model category, and we prove that any additive, stable, combinatorial model category has a natural enrichment over symmetric spectra based on simplicial abelian groups. As a consequence, every object in such a model category has a naturally associated endomorphism ring inside this spectra category. We establish the basic properties of this enrichment.   We also develop some enriched model category theory. In particular, we have a notion of an adjoint pair of functors being a 'module' over another such pair. Such things are called "adjoint modules". We develop the general theory of these, and use them to prove a result about transporting enrichments over one symmetric monoidal model category to a Quillen equivalent one.
