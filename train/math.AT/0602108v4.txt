Let G \to P \to M be a flat principal bundle over a closed and oriented manifold M of dimension m=2d. We construct a map of Lie algebras \Psi: \H_{2\ast} (L M) \to {\o}(\Mc), where \H_{2\ast} (LM) is the even dimensional part of the equivariant homology of LM, the free loop space of M, and \Mc is the Maurer-Cartan moduli space of the graded differential Lie algebra \Omega^\ast (M, \adp), the differential forms with values in the associated adjoint bundle of P. For a 2-dimensional manifold M, our Lie algebra map reduces to that constructed by Goldman in \cite{G2}. We treat different Lie algebra structures on \H_{2\ast}(LM) depending on the choice of the linear reductive Lie group G in our discussion.
