Combinatorial groups together with the groups of natural coalgebra transformations of tensor algebras are linked to the groups of homotopy classes of maps from the James construction to a loop space. This connection gives rise to applications to homotopy theory. The Hopf invariants of the Whitehead products are studied and a rate of exponent growth for the strong version of the Barratt Conjecture is given.
