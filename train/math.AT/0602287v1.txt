This text gives a construction of a differential graded Lie algebra in Nori's category of effective homological motives. In fact the construction works in more a general setting than that of an Abelian category. This allows us to give the rational homotopy Lie algebra of a 1-connected space a motivic structure. As a consequence the rational homotopy Lie algebra inherits a mixed Hodge structure and Galois module structure.
