Let S \subset \R^{k + m} be a compact semi-algebraic set defined by a system of \ell polynomial inequalities of degree at most 2.  Let \pi denote the standard projection from \R^{k + m} onto \R^m. We prove that for any q >0, the sum of the first q Betti numbers of \pi(S) is bounded by (k + m)^{O(q\ell)}. We also present an algorithm for computing the the first q Betti numbers of \pi(S), whose complexity is  (k+m)^{2^{O(q\ell)}}. For fixed q and \ell, both the bounds are polynomial in k+m.
