In this paper, we prove an equivariant version of the classical Dold-Thom theorem. Associated to a finite group, a CW-complex on which this group acts and a covariant coefficient system in the sense of Bredon, we functorially construct a topological abelian group by the coend construction. Then we prove that the homotopy groups of this topological abelian group are naturally isomorphic to the Bredon equivariant homology of the CW-complex. At the end we present several examples of this result.
