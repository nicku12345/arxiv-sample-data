Given an n-term L-infinity algebra L, we construct a Kan simplicial manifold which we think of as the 'Lie n-group' integrating L. This extends work of Getzler math.AT/0404003 . In the case of an ordinary Lie algebra, our construction gives the simplicial classifying space of the corresponding simply connect Lie group. In the case of the string Lie 2-algebra of Baez and Crans, this recovers the model of the string group introduced in math.QA/0504123 .
