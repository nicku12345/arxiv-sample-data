The paper is devoted to generalizations of Cencelj-Dranishnikov theorems relating extension properties of nilpotent CW complexes to its homology groups. Here are the main results of the paper: \par {\bf Theorem}. Suppose L is a nilpotent CW complex and F is the homotopy fiber of the inclusion i of L into its infinite symmetric product SP(L). If X is a metrizable space such that X\tau K(H_k(L),k) for all k\ge 1, then X\tau K(\pi_k(F),k) and X\tau K(\pi_k(L),k) for all k\ge 2. \par {\bf Theorem}. Let X be a metrizable space such that \dim(X) < \infty or X\in ANR. Suppose L is a nilpotent CW complex and SP(L) is its infinite symmetric product. If X\tau SP(L), then X\tau L in the following cases: \begin{itemize} \item[a.] H_1(L) is finitely generated. \item[b.] H_1(L) is a torsion group. \end{itemize}
