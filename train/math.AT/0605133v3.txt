Let (M, \omega) be a connected, compact symplectic manifold equipped with a Hamiltonian G action, where G is a connected compact Lie group. Let \phi be the moment map. In \cite{L}, we proved the following result for G=S^1 action: as fundamental groups of topological spaces, \pi_1(M)=\pi_1(M_{red}), where M_{red} is the symplectic quotient at any value of the moment map \phi. In this paper, we generalize this result to other connected compact Lie group G actions. We also prove that the above fundamental group is isomorphic to that of M/G. We briefly discuss the generalization of the first part of the results to non-compact manifolds with proper moment maps.
