Gerbes are locally connected presheaves of groupoids. They are classified up to local weak equivalence by path components in a 2-cocycle category taking values in all sheaves of groups, their isomorphisms and homotopies. If F is a full presheaf of sheaves of groups, isomorphisms and homotopies, then [*,BF] is isomorphic to equivalence classes of gerbes locally equivalent to groups appearing in F. Giraud's non-abelian cohomology object of equivalence classes of gerbes with band L is isomorphic to morphisms in the homotopy category from the point * to the homotopy fibre over L for a map defined on BF and taking values in the classifying space for the stack completion of the fundamental groupoid of F.
