Combining the Kazarian approach to Thom polynomials via classifying spaces of singularities with the Fulton-Lazarsfeld theory of numerical positivity for ample vector bundles, we show that the coefficients of various Schur function expansions of the Thom polynomials of stable and unstable singularities are nonnegative.
