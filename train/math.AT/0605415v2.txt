By studying modular invariance properties of some characteristic forms, we obtain twisted anomaly cancellation formulas. We apply these twisted cancellation formulas to study divisibilities on spin manifolds and congruences on spin^c manifolds. Especially, we get twisted Rokhlin congruences for 8k+4 dimensional spin^c manifolds
