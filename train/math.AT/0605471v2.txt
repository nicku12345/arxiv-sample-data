We consider operations between two multiplicative, complex orientable cohomology theories. Under suitable hypotheses, we construct a map from unstable to stable operations, left-inverse to the usual map from stable to unstable operations. In the main example, where the target theory is one of the Morava K-theories, this provides a simple and explicit description of a splitting arising from the Bousfield-Kuhn functor
