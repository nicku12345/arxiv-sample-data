An objective of the theory of combinatorial groupoids is to introduce concepts like "holonomy", "parallel transport", "bundles", "combinatorial curvature" etc. in the context of simplicial (polyhedral) complexes, posets, graphs, polytopes, arrangements and other combinatorial objects. In this paper we give an exposition of some of the currently most active research themes in this area, offer a unified point of view, and provide a list of prospective applications in other fields together with a collection of related open problems.
