We give a complete description of the bigraded Bredon cohomology ring of smooth projective real quadrics, with coefficients in the constant Mackey functor  \mathbf{Z} . These invariants are closely related to the integral motivic cohomology ring, which is not known for these varieties. Some of the results and techniques introduced can be applied to other geometrically cellular real varieties.
