In classical fixed point and coincidence theory the notion of Nielsen numbers has proved to be extremely fruitful. We extend it to pairs (f_1,f_2) of maps between manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, using nonstabilized normal bordism theory as our main tool. This leads to estimates of the minimum numbers MCC(f_1,f_2) (and MC(f_1,f_2), respectively) of path components (and of points, resp.) in the coincidence sets of those pairs of maps which are homotopic to (f_1,f_2). Furthermore, we deduce finiteness conditions for MC(f_1,f_2). As an application we compute both minimum numbers explicitly in various concrete geometric sample situations.   The Nielsen decomposition of a coincidence set is induced by the decomposition of a certain path space E(f_1,f_2) into path components. Its higher dimensional topology captures further crucial geometric coincidence data. In the setting of homotopy groups the resulting invariants are closely related to certain Hopf--Ganea homomorphisms which turn out to yield finiteness obstructions for MC.
