When can a map between manifolds be deformed away from itself? We describe a (normal bordism) obstruction which is often computable and in general much stronger than the classical primary obstruction in cohomology. In particular, it answers our question completely in a large dimension range.   As an illustration we give explicit criteria in three sample settings: projections from Stiefel manifolds to Grassmannians, sphere bundle projections and maps defined on spheres. In the first example a theorem of Becker and Schultz concerning the framed bordism class of a compact Lie group plays a central role; our approach yields also a very short geometric proof (included as an appendix) of this result.
