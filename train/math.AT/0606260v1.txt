A. Bak developed a combinatorial approach to higher K-theory, in which control is kept of the elementary operations involved, through paths and `paths of paths' in what he called a global action. The homotopy theory of these was developed by G. Minian. R. Brown and T. Porter developed applications to identities among relations for groups, and also the extension to groupoid atlases. This paper is intended as an introduction tothis circle of ideas, and so to give a basis for exploration and development of this area.
