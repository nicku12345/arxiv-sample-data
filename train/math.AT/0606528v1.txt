Let X be a simply connected pointed space with finitely generated homotopy groups. Let \Pi_n(X) denote the set of all continuous maps a:I^n\to X taking \partial I^n to the basepoint. For a\in\Pi_n(X), let [a]\in\pi_n(X) be its homotopy class. For an open set E\subset I^n, let \Pi(E,X) be the set of all continuous maps a:E\to X taking E\cap\partial I^n to the basepoint. For a cover \Gamma of I^n, let \Gamma(r) be the set of all unions of at most r elements of \Gamma. Put r=(n-1)!. We prove that for any finite open cover \Gamma of I^n there exist maps f_E:\Pi(E,X)\to\pi_n(X)\otimes Z[1/2], E\in\Gamma(r), such that  [a]\otimes1=\sum_{E\in\Gamma(r)} f_E(a|_E)  for all a\in\Pi_n(X).
