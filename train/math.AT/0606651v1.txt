Farrell and Hsiang noticed that the geometric surgery groups defined By Wall, Chapter 9, do not have the naturality Wall claims for them. They were able to fix the problem by augmenting Wall's definitions to keep track of a line bundle.   The definition of geometric Wall groups involves homology with local coefficients and these also lack Wall's claimed naturality.   One would hope that a geometric bordism theory involving non-orientable manifolds would enjoy the same naturality as that enjoyed by homology with local coefficients. A setting for this naturality entirely in terms of local coefficients is presented in this paper.   Applying this theory to the example of non-orientable Wall groups restores much of the elegance of Wall's original approach. Furthermore, a geometric determination of the map induced by conjugation by a group element is given.
