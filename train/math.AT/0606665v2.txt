We show that every bad orbifold vector bundle can be realized as the restriction of a good orbifold vector bundle to a suborbifold of the base space. We give an explicit construction of this result in which the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology of the two base spaces are isomorphic (as additive groups). This construction is used to indicate an extension of the Chern-Weil construction of characteristic classes to bad orbifold vector bundles. In particular, we apply this construction to the orbifold Euler class and demonstrate that it acts as an obstruction to the existence of nonvanishing sections.
