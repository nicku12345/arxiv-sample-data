We prove that, in the category F of functors between F\_2-vector spaces, the tensor product between the second non constant standard injective functor and an exterior power functor is artinian. The only cas known to date was the artinian character of this injective ; our result is a step in the study of the third non constant standard injective. We use the division functor by the identity functor and facts from modular representation theory of the symmetric groups to obtain this theorem by detecing suitable composition factors.
