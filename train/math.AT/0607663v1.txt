Let X(\Delta) be the real toric variety associated to a smooth fan \Delta. The main purpose of this article is: (i) to determine the fundamental group and the universal cover of X(\Delta), (ii) to give necessary and sufficient conditions on \Delta under which \pi_1(X(\Delta)) is abelian, (iii) to give necessary and sufficient conditions on \Delta under which X(\Delta) is aspherical, and when \Delta is complete, (iv) to give necessary and sufficient conditions for \cc_{\Delta} to be a K(\pi,1) space where \cc_{\Delta} is the complement of a real subspace arrangement associated to \Delta.
