For every prime p and integer n\ge 3 we explicitly construct an abelian variety A/\F_{p^n} of dimension n such that for a suitable prime l the group of quasi-isogenies of A/\F_{p^n} of l-power degree is canonically a dense subgroup of the n-th Morava stabilizer group at p. We also give a variant of this result taking into account a polarization. This is motivated by a perceivable generalization of topological modular forms to more general topological automorphic forms. For this, we prove some results about approximation of local units in maximal orders which is of independent interest. For example, it gives a precise solution to the problem of extending automorphisms of the p-divisible group of a simple abelian variety over a finite field to quasi-isogenies of the abelian variety of degree divisible by as few primes as possible.
