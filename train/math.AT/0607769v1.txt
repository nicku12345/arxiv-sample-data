We put a monoidal model category structure on the category of chain complexes of quasi-coherent sheaves over a quasi-compact and semi-separated scheme X. The approach generalizes and simplifies methods used by the author to build monoidal model structures on the category of chain complexes of modules over a ring and chain complexes of sheaves over a ringed space. Indeed, much of the paper is dedicated to showing that in any Grothendieck category G, a nice enough class of objects, which we call a Kaplansky class, induces a model structure on the category Ch(G) of chain complexes. We also find simple conditions to put on the Kaplansky class which will guarantee that our model structure in monoidal. We see that the common model structures used in practice are all induced by such Kaplansky classes.
