The {\it torus manifolds} have been defined and studied by M. Masuda and T. Panov (arXiv:math.AT/0306100) who in particular describe its cohomology ring structure. In this note we shall describe the topological K-ring of a class of torus manifolds (those for which the orbit space under the action of the compact torus is a {\it homology polytope} whose {\it nerve} is a {shellable} simplicial complex) in terms of generators and relations. Since these torus manifolds include the class of quasi-toric manifolds this is a generalisation of earlier results due to the author and P. Sankaran (arXiv: math.AG/0504107).
