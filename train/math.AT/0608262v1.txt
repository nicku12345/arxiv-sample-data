Let G be a profinite group. We define an S[[G]]-module to be a G-spectrum X that satisfies certain conditions, and, given an S[[G]]-module X, we define the homotopy orbit spectrum X_{hG}. When G is countably based and X satisfies a certain finiteness condition, we construct a homotopy orbit spectral sequence whose E_2-term is the continuous homology of G with coefficients in the graded profinite \hat{\mathbb{Z}}[[G]]-module \pi_\ast(X). Let G_n be the extended Morava stabilizer group and let E_n be the Lubin-Tate spectrum. As an application of our theory, we show that the function spectrum F(E_n,L_{K(n)}(S^0)) is an S[[G_n]]-module with an associated homotopy orbit spectral sequence.
