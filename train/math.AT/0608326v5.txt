In this article we study the Poisson algebra structure on the homology of the totalization of a fibrant cosimplicial space associated with an operad with multiplication. This structure is given as the Browder operation induced by the action of little disks operad, which was found by McClure and Smith. We show that the Browder operation coincides with the Gerstenhaber bracket on the Hochschild homology, which appears as the E2-term of the homology spectral sequence constructed by Bousfield. In particular we consider a variant of the space of long knots in higher dimensional Euclidean space, and show that Sinha's homology spectral sequence computes the Poisson algebra structure of the homology of the space. The Browder operation produces a homology class which does not directly correspond to chord diagrams.
