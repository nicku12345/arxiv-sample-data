For any complex vector bundle E^k of rank k over a manifold M^m with Chern classes c_i \in H^{2i}(M^m,\Z) and any non-negative integers l_1, >..., l_k we show the existence of a positive number N(k,m) and the existence of a complex vector bundle \hat E^k over M^m whose Chern classes are  N(k,m) \cdot l_i\cdot c_i\in H^{2i} (M^m,\Z). We also discuss a version of this statement for holomorphic vector bundles over projective algebraic manifolds.
