These notes are an introduction to basic properties of Andre-Quillen homology for commutative algebras. They are an expanded version of my lectures at the summer school: Interactions between homotopy theory and algebra, University of Chicago, 26th July - 6th August, 2004. The aim is to give fairly complete proofs of characterizations of smooth homomorphisms and of locally complete intersection homomorphisms in terms of vanishing of Andre-Quillen homology. The choice of the material, and the point of view, are guided by these goals.
