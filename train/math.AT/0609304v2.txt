Let M be a compact oriented d-dimensional smooth manifold. Chas and Sullivan have defined a structure of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra on \mathbb{H}_*(LM). Extending work of Cohen, Jones and Yan, we compute this Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure when M is a sphere S^d, d\geq 1. In particular, we show that \mathbb{H}_*(LS^2;\mathbb{F}_2) and the Hochschild cohomology HH^{*}(H^*(S^2);H^*(S^2)) are surprisingly not isomorphic as Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras, although we prove that, as expected, the underlying Gerstenhaber algebras are isomorphic. The proof requires the knowledge of the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra H_*(\Omega^2 S^3;\mathbb{F}_2) that we compute in the Appendix.
