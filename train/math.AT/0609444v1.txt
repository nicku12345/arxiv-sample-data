Let EK be the simplicial suspension of a pointed simplicial set K. We construct a chain model of the James map, \alpha_{K} : CK \to \Omega CEK. We compute the cobar diagonal on \Omega CEK, not assuming that EK is 1-reduced, and show that \alpha_{K} is comultiplicative. As a result, the natural isomorphism of chain algebras TCK \cong \Omega CK preserves diagonals.   In an appendix, we show that the Milgram map, \Omega (A \otimes B) \to \Omega A \otimes \Omega B, where A and B are coaugmented coalgebras, forms part of a strong deformation retract of chain complexes. Therefore, it is a chain equivalence even when A and B are not 1-connected.
