Let (X,0) be an isolated complete intersection complex singularity (X can also be smooth at 0). Let K be its link, \cal X its canonical contact structure and \D_X the complex vector bundle associated to \cal X. We prove that the bundle \D_X is trivial if and only if the Milnor number of X satisfies \mu(X,0) \equiv (-1)^{n-1} modulo (n-1)!. This follows from a general theorem stating that the complex orthogonal complement of a vector field in X with an isolated singularity at 0 is trivial iff the GSV-index of v is a multiple of (n-1)!. We have also an application to foliation theory: a holomorphic foliation \cal F in a ball \B_r around the origin in \C^3, with an isolated singularity at 0, admits a C^\infty normal section (away from 0) iff its multiplicity (or local index) is even, and this happens iff its normal bundle in \B_r \setminus \{0\} is topologically trivial.
