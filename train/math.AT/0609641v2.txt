Let G be a compact Lie group. We present two induction theorems for certain generalized G-equivariant cohomology theories. The theory applies to G-equivariant K-theory K_G, and to the Borel cohomology associated to any complex oriented cohomology theory. The coefficient ring of K_G is the representation ring R(G) of G. When G is a finite group the induction theorems for K_G coincide with the classical Artin and Brauer induction theorems for R(G).
