Let \xi=(X,p,B,G) be a principal G-bundle, F be a G space and \eta=(E,p,B,F) be the associated bundle with the fiber F. Generally \xi and the action H_*(G)\otimes H_*(F)\to H_*(F) of the Pontriagin ring H_*(G) on H_*(F) do not define homologies of E. In this paper we define a two sequences of operations \{f^i:H_*(G)^{\otimes i}\to H_*(G), i=3,4,...\}, which we call Hochschild twisting cochain (with respect to Gerstenhaber product), and which in fact form on H_*(G) an A(\infty-algebra structure), and \{\bar{f}^i:H_*(G)^{\otimes (i-1)}\otimes H*(F)\to H_*(F), i=3,4,...\} (which in fact form on H_*(F) an A(\infty)-module structure over the A(\infty)-algebra (H_*(G),\{f^i\})) and show that \xi and these higher structures define H_*(E).
