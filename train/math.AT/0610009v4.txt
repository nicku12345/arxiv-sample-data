We define Anderson-Brown-Cisinski (ABC) cofibration categories, and construct homotopy colimits of diagrams of objects in ABC cofibration categories. Homotopy colimits for Quillen model categories are obtained as a particular case. We attach to each ABC cofibration category a left Heller derivator. A dual theory is developed for homotopy limits in ABC fibration categories and for right Heller derivators. These constructions provide a natural framework for 'doing homotopy theory' in ABC (co)fibration categories.
