We present a new short proof of the explicit formula for the group of links (and also link maps) in the 'quadruple point free' dimension. Denote by L^m_{p,q} (respectively, C^{m-p}_p) the group of smooth embeddings S^p\sqcup S^q\to S^m (respectively, S^p\to S^m) up to smooth isotopy. Denote by LM^m_{p,q} the group of link maps S^p\sqcup S^q\to S^m up to link homotopy.   Theorem 1. If p\le q\le m-3 and 2p+2q\le 3m-6 then \begin{equation*} L^m_{p,q}\cong \pi_p(S^{m-q-1})\oplus\pi_{p+q+2-m}(SO/SO_{m-p-1})\oplus C^{m-p}_p\oplus C^{m-q}_q. \end{equation*} Theorem 2. If p, q\le m-3 and 2p+2q\le 3m-5 then LM^m_{p,q}\cong \pi^S_{p+q+1-m}.   Our approach is based on the use of the suspension operation for links and link maps, and suspension theorems for them.
