In math.GT/0002110 the author's Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, combined, implied that iterated torus knots are transversally simple.   This result is in error and this erratum pin points the error. In "An addendum on iterated torus knots" a more subtle result is proven resulting in giving a geometric realization of the Honda-Etnyre transverse (2,3)-cable of the (2,3)-torus knot example--Appendix joint with H. Matsuda. (See math.SG/0306330 and math.GT/0610566.)
