In this paper we study symmetric motion planning algorithms, i.e. such that the motion from one state A to another B, prescribed by the algorithm, is the time reverse of the motion from B to A. We experiment with several different notions of topological complexity of such algorithms and compare them with each other and with the usual (non-symmetric) concept of topological complexity. Using equivariant cohomology and the theory of Schwarz genus we obtain cohomological lower bounds for symmetric topological complexity. One of our main results states that in the case of aspherical manifolds the complexity of symmetric motion planning algorithms with fixed midpoint map exceeds twice the cup-length.   We introduce a new concept, the sectional category weight of a cohomology class, which generalises the notion of category weight developed earlier by E. Fadell and S. Husseini. We apply this notion to study the symmetric topological complexity of aspherical manifolds.
