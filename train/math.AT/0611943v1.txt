Let us take for granted that L_{K(n)}S^0 --> E_n is some kind of a G_n-Galois extension. Of course, this is in the setting of continuous G_n-spectra. How much structure does this continuous G-Galois extension have? How much structure does one want to build into this notion to obtain useful conclusions? If the author's conjecture that ``E_n/I, for a cofinal collection of I's, is a discrete G_n-symmetric ring spectrum" is true, what additional structure does this give the continuous G_n-Galois extension? Is it useful or merely beautiful? This paper is an exploration of how to answer these questions. This preprint arose as a letter to John Rognes, whom he thanks for a helpful conversation in Rosendal. This paper was written before John's preprints (the initial version and the final one) on Galois extensions were available.
