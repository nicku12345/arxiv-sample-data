The aim of this paper is to present a very simple original, purely formal, proof of Quillen's adjunction theorem for derived functors, and of some more recent variations and generalizations of this theorem. This is obtained by proving an abstract adjunction theorem for "absolute" derived functors. In contrast with all known proofs, the explicit construction of the derived functors is not used.
