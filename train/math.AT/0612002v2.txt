In combinatorial problems it is sometimes possible to define a G-equivariant mapping from a space X of configurations of a system to a Euclidean space \mathbb{R}^m for which a coincidence of the image of this mapping with an arrangement \mathcal{A} of linear subspaces insures a desired set of linear conditions on a configuration. Borsuk-Ulam type theorems give conditions under which no G-equivariant mapping of X to the complement of the arrangement exist. In this paper, precise conditions are presented which lead to such theorems through a spectral sequence argument. We introduce a blow up of an arrangement whose complement has particularly nice cohomology making such arguments possible. Examples are presented that show that these conditions are best possible.
