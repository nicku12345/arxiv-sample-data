This paper is an expanded version of two talks given by the author at the Summer School on the Interactions between Homotopy Theory and Algebra at the University of Chicago, July 26 to August 6, 2004. It describes a connection between model categories, a structure invented by algebraic topologists that allows one to introduce the ideas of homotopy theory to situations far removed from topological spaces, and cotorsion pairs, an algebraic notion that simultaneously generalizes the notion of projective and injective objects. It also gives some applications of this connection, some due to the authour about model structures on Z[G]-modules for G a finite group, and some due to Jim Gillespie about flat model structures of sheaves.
