Let p be an odd regular prime, and let G_p denote the extraspecial p--group of order p^{3} and exponent p. We show that G_p acts freely and smoothly on S^{2p-1} \times S^{2p-1}. For p=3 we explicitly construct a free smooth action of a Lie group \widetilde{G}_3 containing G_3 on S^{5} \times S^{5}. In addition, we show that any finite odd order subgroup of the exceptional Lie group \Gtwo  admits a free smooth action on S^{11}\times S^{11}.
