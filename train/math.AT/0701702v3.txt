Let f,g: X\to G/K be maps from a closed connected orientable manifold X to an orientable coset space M=G/K where G is a compact connected Lie group, K a closed subgroup and \dim X=\dim M. In this paper, we show that if L(f,g)=0 then N(f,g)=0; if L(f,g)\ne 0 then N(f,g)=R(f,g) where L(f,g), N(f,g), and R(f,g) denote the Lefschetz, Nielsen, and Reidemeister coincidence numbers of f and g, respectively. When \dim X> \dim M, we give conditions under which N(f,g)=0 implies f and g are deformable to be coincidence free.
