Let {\frak M}_n be the set of equivariant unoriented cobordism classes of all n-dimensional 2-torus manifolds, where an n-dimensional 2-torus manifold M is a smooth closed manifold of dimension n with effective smooth action of a rank n 2-torus group ({\Bbb Z}_2)^n. Then {\frak M}_n forms an abelian group with respect to disjoint union. This paper determines the group structure of {\frak M}_n and shows that each class of {\frak M}_n contains a small cover as its representative in the case n=3.
