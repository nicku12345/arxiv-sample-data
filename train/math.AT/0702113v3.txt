The based loop space homology of a special family of homogeneous spaces, flag manifolds of connected compact Lie groups is studied. First, the rational homology of the based loop space on a complete flag manifold is calculated together with its Pontrjagin structure. Second, it is shown that the integral homology of the based loop space on a flag manifold is torsion free. This results in a description of the integral homology. In addition, the integral Pontrjagin structure is determined.
