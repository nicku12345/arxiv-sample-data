We study the space of "link maps": the space of maps of a disjoint union of compact, closed manifolds P_1, . . ., P_k into a manifold N whose images are pairwise disjoint. We apply the manifold calculus of functors developed by Goodwillie and Weiss to study the difference between it and its linear and quadratic approximations. We identify an appropriate generalization of the linking number as the geometric object which measures the difference between the space of link maps and its linear approximation. Our analysis of the difference between link maps and its quadratic approximation connects with recent work of the author, and is used to show that the Borromean rings are linked. We also conjecture connectivity estimates for the approximating spaces.
