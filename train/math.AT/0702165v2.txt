The moduli space \bar{M}_S^\sigma(R) parameterizes the isomorphism classes of S-pointed stable real curves of genus zero which are invariant under relabeling by the involution \sigma. This moduli space is stratified according to the degeneration types of \sigma-invariant curves. The degeneration types of \sigma-invariant curves are encoded by their dual trees with additional decorations. We construct a combinatorial graph complex generated by the fundamental classes of strata of \bar{M}_S^\sigma(R). We show that the homology of \bar{M}_S^\sigma(R) is isomorphic to the homology of our graph complex. We also give a presentation of the fundamental group of \bar{M}_S^\sigma(R).
