The aim of this article is to introduce Vogel's localization theorem for classes of D-complexes: this generalization of Waldhausen's localization theorem is especially useful and powerful in that it gives an explicit and computable description of the local objects. Next we present an excision theorem for transverse classes. Finally, we apply these methods to deduce partial results on Vogel's [Conjecture] on a regular ring R (cf [Bih01]).
