The complex affine quadric Q^{m}=\{z\in {\Bbb C}^{m+1}\mid z_{1}^{2}+...+z_{m+1}^{2}=1\} deforms by retraction onto S^{m}; this allows us to identify [Q^{k},Q^{n}] and [S^{k},S^{n}]=\pi_{k}(S^{n}). Thus one will say that an element of \pi_{k}(S^{n}) is complex representable if there exists a complex polynomial map from Q^{k} to Q^{n} corresponding to this class. In this Note we show that \pi_{n+1}(S^{n}) and \pi_{n+2}(S^{n}) are complex representable.
