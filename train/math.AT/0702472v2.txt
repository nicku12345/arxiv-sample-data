The moduli space \bar{M}_A of weighted pointed stable curves of genus zero is stratified according to the degeneration types of such curves. We show that the homology groups of the moduli space \bar{M}_A are generated by the strata of \bar{M}_A and give all additive relations between them. We also observe that the Chow groups A_i \bar{M}_A and the homology groups H_{2i} \bar{M}_A are isomorphic. This generalizes Kontsevich-Manin's and Losev-Manin's theorems to arbitrary weight data A.
