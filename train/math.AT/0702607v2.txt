Let M denote a two-dimensional Moore space (so H_2(M; \Z) = 0), with fundamental group G. The M-cellular spaces are those one can build from M by using wedges, push-outs, and telescopes (and hence all pointed homotopy colimits). The question we address here is to characterize the class of M-cellular spaces by means of algebraic properties derived from the group G. We show that the cellular type of the fundamental group and homological information does not suffice, and one is forced to study a certain universal extension.
