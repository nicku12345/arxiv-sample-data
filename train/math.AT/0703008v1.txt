We survey various Alexander-type invariants of plane curve complements, with an emphasis on obstructions on the type of groups that can arise as fundamental groups of complements to complex plane curves. Also included are some new computations of higher-order degrees of curves, which are invariants defined in a previous paper of the authors.
