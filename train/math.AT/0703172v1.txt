For every regular cardinal \alpha, we construct a cofibrantly generated Quillen model structure on a category whose objects are essentially DG categories which are stable under suspensions, cosuspensions, cones and \alpha-small sums. Using results of Porta, we show that the category of well-generated (algebraic) triangulated categories in the sense of Neeman is naturally enhanced by our Quillen model category.
