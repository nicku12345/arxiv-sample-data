This is a quick survey on the characteristic varieties associated to rank one local systems on a smooth, irreducible, quasi-projective complex variety M. A key new result is Proposition 1.8, giving additional information on the constructible sheaf \F=R^0f_*(\LL), where \LL is a rank one local system on M and f:M \to S is a surjective morphism with S a smooth curve and the generic fiber F of f connected. Corollary 1.9 says that for S compact, the singular support of \F cannot be a singleton.
