By studying the group of self homotopy equivalences of the localization (at a prime p and/or zero) of some aspherical complexes, we show that, contrary to the case when the considered space is a nilpotent complex, \mathcal{E}_{\#}^m (X_{p}) is in general different from \mathcal{E}_{\#}^m (X)_{p}. That is the case even when X=K(G,1) is a finite complex and/or G satisfies extra finiteness or nilpotency conditions, for instance, when G is finite or virtually nilpotent.
