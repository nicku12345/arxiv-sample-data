In this paper we study the nilpotency of certain groups of self homotopy equivalences. Our main goal is to extend, to localized homotopy groups and/or homotopy groups with coefficients, the general principle of Dror and Zabrodsky by which a group of self homotopy equivalences of a finite space which acts nilpotently on the homotopy groups is itself nilpotent.
