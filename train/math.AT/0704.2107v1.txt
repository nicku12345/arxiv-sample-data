We extend Hendriks' classification theorem and Turaev's realisation and splitting theorems for Poincare duality complexes in dimension three to the relative case of Poincare duality pairs. The results for Poincare duality complexes are recovered by restricting the results to the case of Poincare duality pairs with empty boundary. Up to oriented homotopy equivalence, three-dimensional Poincare duality pairs are classified by their fundamental triple consisting of the fundamental group system, the orientation character and the image of the fundamental class under the classifying map. Using the derived module category we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a given triple to be realised by a three-dimensional Poincare duality pair. The results on classification and realisation yield splitting or decomposition theorems for three-dimensional Poincare duality pairs, that is, conditions under which a given three-dimensional Poincare duality pair decomposes as interior or boundary connected sum of two three-dimensional Poincare duality pairs.
