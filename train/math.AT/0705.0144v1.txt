Let X be a nilpotent space such that there exists p\geq 1 with H^p(X,\mathbb Q) \ne 0 and H^n(X,\mathbb Q)=0 if n>p. Let Y be a m-connected space with m\geq p+1 and H^*(Y,\mathbb Q) is finitely generated as algebra. We assume that X is formal and there exists p odd such that H^p(X,\mathbb Q) \ne 0. We prove that if the space \mathcal F(X,Y) of continuous maps from X to Y is formal, then Y has the rational homotopy type of a product of Eilenberg Mac Lane spaces. At the opposite, we exhibit an example of a formal space \mathcal F(S^2,Y) where Y is not rationally equivalent to a product of Eilenberg Mac Lane spaces.
