We construct an abelian category A(G) of sheaves over a category of closed subgroups of the r-torus G and show it is of finite injective dimension. It can be used as a model for rational G-spectra in the sense that there is a homology theory   \piA_*: G-spectra/Q --> A(G) on rational G-spectra with values in A(G), and the associated Adams spectral sequence converges for all rational G-spectra and collapses at a finite stage.
