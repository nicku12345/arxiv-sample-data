Let p be an odd prime. We construct a non-abelian extension \Gamma of S^1 by Z/p \times Z/p, and prove that any finite subgroup of \Gamma acts freely and smoothly on S^{2p-1} \times S^{2p-1}. In particular, for each odd prime p we obtain free smooth actions of infinitely many non-metacyclic rank two p-groups on S^{2p-1} \times S^{2p-1}. These results arise from a general approach to the existence problem for finite group actions on products of equidimensional spheres.
