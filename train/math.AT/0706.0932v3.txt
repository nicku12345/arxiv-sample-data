Physicists showed that the generating function of orbifold elliptic genera of symmetric orbifolds can be written as an infinite product. We show that there exists a geometric factorization on space level behind this infinite product formula in much more general framework, where factors in the infinite product correspond to isomorphism classes of connected finite covering spaces of manifolds involved. From this formula, a concept of geometric Hecke operators for functors emerges. We show that these Hecke operators indeed satisfy the usual identity of Hecke operators for the case of 2-dimensional tori.
