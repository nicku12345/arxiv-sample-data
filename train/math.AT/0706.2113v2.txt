We determine a family of functors from a poset to abelian groups such that the higher direct limits vanish on them. This is done by first characterizing the projective functors. Then a spectral sequence arising from the grading of the poset is used. Also the dual version for injective functors and higher inverse limits is included. Graded posets include simplicial complexes, subdivision categories and simplex-like posets.
