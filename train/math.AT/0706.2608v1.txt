We study the multi-dimensional persistence of Carlsson and Zomorodian and obtain a finer classification based upon the higher tor-modules of a persistence module. We propose a variety structure on the set of isomorphism classes of these modules, and present several examples. We also provide a geometric interpretation for the higher tor-modules of homology modules of multi-filtered simplicial complexes.
