Let X be a nilpotent space such that there exists N\geq 1 with H^N(X,\mathbb Q) \ne 0 and H^n(X,\mathbb Q)=0 if n>N. Let Y be a m-connected space with m\geq N+1 and H^*(Y,\mathbb Q) is finitely generated as algebra. We assume that the odd part of the rational Hurewicz homomorphism: \pi_{odd}(X)\otimes \mathbb Q\to H_{odd}(X,\mathbb Q) is non-zero. We prove that if the space \mathcal F(X,Y) of continuous maps from X to Y is rationally formal, then Y has the rational homotopy type of a finite product of Eilenberg Mac Lane spaces. At the opposite, we exhibit an example of a rationally formal space \mathcal F(S^2,Y) where Y is not rationally equivalent to a product of Eilenberg Mac Lane spaces.
