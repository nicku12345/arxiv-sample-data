A group is said to have the R_\infty property if every automorphism has an infinite number of twisted conjugacy classes. We study the question whether G has the R_\infty property when G is a finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent group. As a consequence, we show that for every positive integer n\ge 5, there is a compact nilmanifold of dimension n on which every homeomorphism is isotopic to a fixed point free homeomorphism. As a by-product, we give a purely group theoretic proof that the free group on two generators has the R_\infty property. The R_{\infty} property for virtually abelian and for \mathcal C-nilpotent groups are also discussed.
