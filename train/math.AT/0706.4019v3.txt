Let G be a finite group. We show that the Bass Nil-groups NK_n(RG), n \in Z, are generated from the p-subgroups of G by induction maps, certain twisting maps depending on elements in the centralizers of the p-subgroups, and the Verschiebung homomorphisms. As a consequence, the groups NK_n(RG) are generated by induction from elementary subgroups. For NK_0(ZG) we get an improved estimate of the torsion exponent.
