A classical theorem of H. Hopf asserts that a closed connected smooth manifold admits a nowhere vanishing vector field if and only if its Euler characteristic is zero. R. Brown generalized Hopf's result to topological manifolds, replacing vector fields with path fields. In this note, we give an equivariant analog of Brown's theorem for locally smooth G-manifolds where G is a finite group.
