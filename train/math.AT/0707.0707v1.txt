We prove two results from Morita theory of stable model categories. Both can be regarded as topological versions of recent algebraic theorems. One is on recollements of triangulated categories, which have been studied in the algebraic case by J{\o}rgensen. We give a criterion which answers the following question: When is there a recollement for the derived category of a given symmetric ring spectrum in terms of two other symmetric ring spectra? The other result is on well generated triangulated categories in the sense of Neeman. Porta characterizes the algebraic well generated categories as localizations of derived categories of DG categories. We prove a topological analogon: a topological triangulated category is well generated if and only if it is triangulated equivalent to a localization of the derived category of a symmetric ring spectrum with several objects. Here `topological' means triangulated equivalent to the homotopy category of a spectral model category. Moreover, we show that every well generated spectral model category is Quillen equivalent to a Bousfield localization of a category of modules via a single Quillen functor.
