In this paper we prove two theorems which resemble the classical cohomological and homological Brown representability theorems. The main difference is that our results classify small contravariant functors from spaces to spaces up to weak equivalence of functors.   In more detail, we show that every small contravariant functor from spaces to spaces which takes coproducts to products up to homotopy and takes homotopy pushouts to homotopy pullbacks is naturally weekly equivalent to a representable functor.   The second representability theorem states: every contravariant continuous functor from the category of finite simplicial sets to simplicial sets taking homotopy pushouts to homotopy pullbacks is equivalent to the restriction of a representable functor. This theorem may be considered as a contravariant analog of Goodwillie's classification of linear functors.
