We construct periodic families of Poincare complexes, partially solving a question of Hodgson that was posed in the proceedings of the 1982 Northwestern homotopy theory conference. We also construct infinite families of Poincare complexes whose top cell falls off after one suspension but which fail to embed in a sphere of codimension one. We give a homotopy theoretic description of the four-fold periodicity in knot cobordism.
