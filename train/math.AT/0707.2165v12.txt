Motivated by the cohomology theory of loop spaces, we consider a special class of higher order homotopy commutative differential graded algebras and construct the filtered Hirsch model for such an algebra A. When x\in H(A) with \mathbb{Z} coefficients and x^{2}=0, the symmetric Massey products % \langle x\rangle ^{n} with n\geq 3 have a finite order (whenever defined). However, if \Bbbk  is a field of characteristic zero, \langle x\rangle ^{n} is defined and vanishes in H(A\otimes \Bbbk ) for all n. If p is an odd prime, the Kraines formula \langle x\rangle ^{p}=-\beta \mathcal{P}_{1}(x) lifts to H^{\ast }(A\otimes {\mathbb{Z}}_{p}). Applications of the existence of polynomial generators in the loop homology and the Hochschild cohomology with a G-algebra structure are given.
