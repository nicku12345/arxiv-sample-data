Base of fibered correspondence is arbitrary correspondence. Fibered correspondence is interesting when we consider relationship between different bundles. However composition of fibered correspondences may not always be defined. Reduced fibered correspondence is defined only between fibers over the same point of base. Reduced fibered correspondence in bundle is called 2-ary fibered relation. We considered fibered equivalence and isomorphism theorem in case of fibered morphisms.
