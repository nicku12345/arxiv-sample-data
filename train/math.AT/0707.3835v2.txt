Let M be a closed, connected, orientable topological four-manifold with H_1(M) nontrivial and free abelian, b_2(M)\ne 0, 2, and \chi(M)\ne 0. We show that if G is a finite group of 2-rank \le 1 which admits a homologically trivial, locally linear, effective action on M, then G must be cyclic.   With additional assumptions to ensure orientability of some components of the singular set (e.g. if G acts by symplectic symmetries, or preserving a spin structure), we also rule out C_2 \times C_2 actions.   The proofs use equivariant cohomology, localization, and a careful study of the first cohomology groups of the (potential) singular set.
