In this paper we establish the existence of certain structures on the ordinary and equivariant homology of the free loop space on a manifold or, more generally, a formal Poincar\'e duality space. These structures; namely the loop product, the loop bracket and the string bracket, were introduced and studied by Chas and Sullivan under the general heading `string topology'. Our method is based on obstruction theory for C_\infty-algebras and rational homotopy theory. The resulting string topology operations are manifestly homotopy invariant.
