The main result of this paper is to calculate the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure of HH^*(C^*(\mathbf{K}P^n;R);C^*(\mathbf{K}P^n;R)) for  \mathbf{K}=\mathbb{C} and \mathbb{H}, and R=\mathbb{Z} and any field; and shows that in the special case when M=\mathbb{C}P^1=S^2, and R=\mathbb{Z}, this structure can not be identified with the BV-structure of \mathbb{H}_*(LS^2;\mathbb{Z}) computed by Luc Memichi in \cite{menichi2}. However, the induced Gerstenhaber structures are still identified in this case. Moreover, according to a recent work of Y.Felix and J.Thomas \cite{felix--thomas}, the main result of the present paper eventually calculates the BV-structure of the rational loop homology, \mathbb{H}_*(L\mathbb{C}P^n;\mathbb{Q}) and \mathbb{H}_*(L\mathbb{H}P^n;\mathbb{Q}), of projective spaces.
