A rank one local system \LL on a smooth complex algebraic variety M is 1-admissible if the dimension of the first cohomology group H^1(M,\LL) can be computed from the cohomology algebra H^*(M,\C) in degrees \leq 2. Under the assumption that M is 1-formal, we show that all local systems, except finitely many, on a non-translated irreducible component W of the first characteristic variety \V_1(M) are 1-admissible, see Proposition 3.1. The same result holds for local systems on a translated component W, but now H^*(M,\C) should be replaced by H^*(M_0,\C), where M_0 is a Zariski open subset obtained from M by deleting some hypersurfaces determined by the translated component W, see Theorem 4.3.
