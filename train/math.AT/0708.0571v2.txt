Steenrod operations have been defined by Voedvodsky in motivic cohomology in order to show the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures. These operations have also been constructed by Brosnan for Chow rings. The purpose of this paper is to provide a setting for the construction of the Steenrod operations in algebraic geometry, for generalized cohomology theories whose formal group law has order two. We adapt the methods used by Bisson-Joyal in studying Steenrod and Dyer-Lashof operations in unoriented cobordism and mod 2 cohomology.
