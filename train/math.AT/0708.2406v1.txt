A correspondence is studied by H. Matsuda between front projections of Legendrian links in the standard contact structure for 3-space and rectangular diagrams. In this paper, we introduce braided rectangular diagrams, and study a relationship with Legendrian links in the standard contact structure for 3-space. We show Alexander and Markov Theorems for Legendrian links in 3-space.
