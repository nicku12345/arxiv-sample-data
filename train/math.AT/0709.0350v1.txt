This is a survey paper of author's results on cobordism groups and semigroups of fold maps and simple fold maps. The results include: establishing a relation between fold maps and immersions through geometrical invariants of cobordism classes of fold maps and simple fold maps in terms of immersions with prescribed normal bundles, detecting stable homotopy groups of spheres as direct summands of the cobordism semigroups of fold maps, Pontryagin-Thom type construction for -1 codimensional fold maps and estimations about the cobordism classes of manifolds which have fold maps into stably parallelizable manifolds. In the last section some of these results are extended and we show that our invariants also detect stable homotopy groups of the classifying spaces BO(k) as direct summands of the cobordism semigroups of fold maps.
