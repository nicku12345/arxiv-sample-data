The notions of deleted and restricted arrangements have been useful in the study of arrangements of hyperplanes. If A is an arrangement of hyperplanes, x in A and A', A'' the deleted and restricted arrangements, there is a formula connecting the Poincare polynomials of the complement spaces M(A), M(A') and M(A'').   In this paper, we consider the extension of this formula to arbitrary subspaces arrangements. The main result is the existence of a long exact sequence connecting the rational cohomology of M(A), M(A') and M(A''). Using this sequence, we obtain new results connecting the Betti numbers and Poincare polynomials of deleted and restricted arrangements.
