We study the notion of twisting elements da=a\cup_1a with respect to \cup_1 product when it is a part of homotopy Gerstenhaber algebra structure. This allows to bring to one context the two classical concepts, the theory of deformation of algebras of M. Gerstenhaber, and A(\infty)-algebras of J. Stasheff.
