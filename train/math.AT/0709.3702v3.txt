We determine the Chow rings of the complex algebraic groups of the exceptional type E_6, E_7, and E_8, giving the explicit generators represented by the pull-back images of Schubert varieties of the corresponding flag varieties. This is a continuation of the work of R. Marlin on the computation of the Chow rings of SO_n, Spin_n, G_2, and F_4. Our method is based on Schubert calculus of the corresponding flag varieties, which has its own interest.
