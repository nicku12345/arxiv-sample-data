The state spaces of machines admit the structure of time. A homotopy theory respecting this additional structure can detect machine behavior unseen by classical homotopy theory. In an attempt to bootstrap classical tools into the world of abstract spacetime, we identify criteria for classically homotopic, monotone maps of pospaces to future homotope, or homotope along homotopies monotone in both coordinates, to a common map. We show that consequently, a hypercontinuous lattice equipped with its Lawson topology is future contractible, or contractible along a future homotopy, if its underlying space has connected CW type.
