Under a certain normalization assumption we prove that the \Pro^1-spectrum \mathrm{BGL} of Voevodsky which represents algebraic K-theory is unique over \Spec(\mathbb{Z}). Following an idea of Voevodsky, we equip the \Pro^1-spectrum \mathrm{BGL} with the structure of a commutative \Pro^1-ring spectrum in the motivic stable homotopy category. Furthermore, we prove that under a certain normalization assumption this ring structure is unique over \Spec(\mathbb{Z}). For an arbitrary Noetherian scheme S of finite Krull dimension we pull this structure back to obtain a distinguished monoidal structure on \mathrm{BGL}. This monoidal structure is relevant for our proof of the motivic Conner-Floyd theorem. It has also been used by Gepner and Snaith to obtain a motivic version of Snaith's theorem.
