We show that the K-theory construction of arXiv:math/0403403, which preserves multiplicative structure, extends to a symmetric monoidal closed bicomplete source category, with the multiplicative structure still preserved. The source category of arXiv:math/0403403, whose objects are permutative categories, maps fully and faithfully to the new source category, whose objects are (based) multicategories.
