Cohen, Moore, and Neisendorfer's work on the odd primary homotopy theory of spheres and Moore spaces, as well as the first author's work on the secondary suspension, predicted the existence of a p-local fibration S^2n-1 --> T --> \Omega S^2n+1 whose connecting map is degree p^r. In a long and complex monograph, Anick constructed such a fibration for p>= 5 and r>= 1. Using new methods we give a much more conceptual construction which is also valid for p=3 and r>= 1. We go on to establish several properties of the space T.
