We study twisted Spin^c-manifolds over a paracompact Hausdorff space X with a twisting \alpha: X \to K(\ZZ, 3). We introduce the topological index and the analytical index on the bordism group of \alpha-twisted Spin^c-manifolds over (X, \alpha), taking values in topological twisted K-homology and analytical twisted K-homology respectively. The main result of this paper is to establish the equality between the topological index and the analytical index. We also define a notion of geometric twisted K-homology, whose cycles are geometric cycles of (X, \a) analogous to Baum-Douglas's geometric cycles. As an application of our twisted index theorem, we discuss the twisted longitudinal index theorem for a foliated manifold (X, F) with a twisting \alpha: X \to K(\ZZ, 3), which generalizes the Connes-Skandalis index theorem for foliations and the Atiyah-Singer families index theorem to twisted cases.
