In previous work, we showed that there are appropriate model category structures on the category of simplicial categories and on the category of Segal precategories, and that they are Quillen equivalent to one another and to Rezk's complete Segal space model structure on the category of simplicial spaces. Here, we show that these results still hold if we instead use groupoid or "invertible" cases. Namely, we show that model structures on the categories of simplicial groupoids, Segal pregroupoids, and invertible simplicial spaces are all Quillen equivalent to one another and to the standard model structure on the category of spaces. We prove this result using two different approaches to invertible complete Segal spaces and Segal groupoids.
