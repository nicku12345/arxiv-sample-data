Let (X,c_X) be a convex projective surface equipped with a real structure. The space of stable maps \bar{\mathcal{M}}_{0,k}(X,d) carries different real structures induced by c_X and any order two element \tau of permutation group S_k acting on marked points. Each corresponding real part \R_{\tau}\bar{\mathcal{M}}_{0,k}(X,d) is a real normal projective variety. As the singular locus is of codimension bigger than two, these spaces thus carry a first Stiefel-Whitney class for which we determine a representative in the case k=c_1(X)d-1 where c_1(X) is the first Chern class of X. Namely, we give a homological description of these classes in term of the real part of boundary divisors of the space of stable maps.
