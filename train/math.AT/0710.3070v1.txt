The paper gives a new proof that the model categories of stable modules for the rings Z/(p^2) and (Z/p)[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2) are not Quillen equivalent. The proof uses homotopy endomorphism ring spectra. Our considerations lead to an example of two differential graded algebras which are derived equivalent but whose associated model categories of modules are not Quillen equivalent. As a bonus, we also obtain derived equivalent dgas with non-isomorphic K-theories.
