This work solves the problem of elaborating Ganea and Whitehead definitions for the tangential category of a foliated manifold. We develop these two notions in the category \Tops of stratified spaces, that are topological spaces X endowed with a partition \cF and compare them to a third invariant defined by using open sets. More precisely, these definitions apply to an element (X,\cF) of \Tops together with a class \cA of subsets of X; they are similar to invariants introduced by M. Clapp and D. Puppe.   If (X,\cF)\in\Tops, we define a transverse subset as a subspace A of X such that the intersection S\cap A is at most countable for any S\in \cF. Then we define the Whitehead and Ganea LS-categories of the stratified space by taking the infimum along the transverse subsets. When we have a closed manifold, endowed with a C^1-foliation, the three previous definitions, with \cA the class of transverse subsets, coincide with the tangential category and are homotopical invariants.
