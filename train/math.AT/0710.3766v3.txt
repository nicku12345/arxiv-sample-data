We consider the manifold Fl_n(\mathbb{H})=Sp(n)/Sp(1)^n of all complete flags in \mathbb{H}^n, where \mathbb{H} is the skew-field of quaternions. We study its equivariant K-theory rings with respect to the action of two groups: Sp(1)^n and a certain canonical subgroup T:=(S^1)^n\subset Sp(1)^n (a maximal torus). For the first group action we obtain a Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson type description. For the second one, we describe the ring K_T(Fl_n(\mathbb{H})) as a subring of K_T(Sp(n)/T). This ring is well known, since Sp(n)/T is a complex flag variety.
