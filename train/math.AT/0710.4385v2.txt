In this work the problem about an existence of non-measurable automorphisms of Lie groups finite and as well infinite dimensional over the field of real numbers and also over the non-archimedean local fields is investigated. Non-measurability of automorphisms is considered relative to real-valued measures and also measures with values in non-archimedean local fields. Their existence is proved and a procedure for their construction is given. Their application for a construction of non-measurable irreducible unitary representations is demonstrated.
