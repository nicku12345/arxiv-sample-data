Let f be a real- or circle-valued Morse function on a compact surface M having exactly n>0 critical points. Denote by O the orbit of f with respect to the right action of the group of diffeomorphisms of M. We show that the connected components of O have the homotopy type of a finite-dimensional CW-complex. Actually, these connected components are homotopy equivalent to a certain covering space of the n-th configuration space of the interior of M. As a consequence we obtain that the fundamental group of O is a subgroup of the n-th braid group of M.
