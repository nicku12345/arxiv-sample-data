In this work, we compare the two approximations of a path-connected space X, by the Ganea spaces G_n(X) and by the realizations \|\Lambda_\bullet X\|_{n} of the truncated simplicial resolutions emerging from the loop-suspension cotriple \Sigma\Omega. For a simply connected space X, we construct maps \|\Lambda_\bullet X\|_{n-1}\to G_n(X)\to \|\Lambda_\bullet X\|_{n} over X, up to homotopy. In the case n=2, we prove the existence of a map G_2(X)\to\|\Lambda_\bullet X\|_{1} over X (up to homotopy) and conjecture that this map exists for any n.
