We compute the characteristic varieties and the Alexander polynomial of a finitely generated nilpotent group. We show that the first characteristic variety may be used to detect nilpotence. We use the Alexander polynomial to deduce that the only torsion-free, finitely generated nilpotent groups with positive deficiency are \Z and \Z^2, extending a classical result on nilpotent link groups.
