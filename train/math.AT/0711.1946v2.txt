Let M be any compact simply-connected d-dimensional smooth manifold and let \mathbb{F} be any field. We show that the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology on the singular cochains of M, HH^*(S^*(M);S^*(M)), extends to a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. Such Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra was conjecturated to exist and is expected to be isomorphic to the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra on the free loop space homology on M, H_{*+d}(LM) introduced by Chas and Sullivan. We also show that the negative cyclic cohomology HC^*_-(S^*(M)) has a Lie bracket. Such Lie bracket is expected to coincide with the Chas-Sullivan string bracket on the equivariant homology H_*^{S^1}(LM).
