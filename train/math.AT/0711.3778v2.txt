It has been known that an effective smooth ({\Bbb Z}_2)^k-action on a smooth connected closed manifold M^n fixing a finite set can be associated to a ({\Bbb Z}_2)^k-colored regular graph. In this paper, we consider abstract graphs (\Gamma,\alpha) of ({\Bbb Z}_2)^k-actions, called abstract 1-skeletons. We study when an abstract 1-skeleton is a colored graph of some ({\Bbb Z}_2)^k-action. We also study the existence of faces of an abstract 1-skeleton (note that faces often have certain geometric meanings if an abstract 1-skeleton is a colored graph of some ({\Bbb Z}_2)^k-action).
