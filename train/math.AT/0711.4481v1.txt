Multi-fan is an analogous notion of fan. As a fan is associated to a toric variety a multi-fan is associated to a torus orbifold. Orbifold elliptic class and orbifold elliptic genus are defined for a triple of a multi-fan, a set of generating integral vectors of one dimensional cones and a \mathbb{Q} divisor. They are shown to behave functorially with respect to birational morphisms between these triples. The result may be considered as a combinatorial or topological analogue of the main result of Borisov and Libgober, McKay correspondence for elliptic genera, Ann. of Math., 161 (2005).
