For each odd prime p, we exhibit p-groups G of p-rank two such that (suitably defined) Chern classes of unitary representations of G fail to generate the following rings:   1. The even degree integral cohomology of G;   2. The final page of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for G;   3. The Brown-Peterson generalized cohomology of G.   It follows that these groups afford counterexamples to conjectures of C. B. Thomas, M. F. Atiyah and P. Landweber.
