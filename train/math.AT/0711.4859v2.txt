Chas and Sullivan have defined an intersection-type product on the homology of the free loop space LM of an oriented manifold M. In this paper we show how to extend this construction to a topological conformal field theory of degree d. In particular, we get operations on the homology of LM which are parameterized by the homology of the moduli space of open-closed Riemann surfaces.
