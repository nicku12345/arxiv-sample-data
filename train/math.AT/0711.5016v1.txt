We study the question of whether the Morava K-theory of the classifying space of an elementary abelian group V is a permutation module (in either of two distinct senses) for the automorphism group of V. We use Brauer characters and computer calculations.   We construct and implement an algorithm for finding permutation submodules of maximal dimension inside modules for p-groups in characteristic p.
