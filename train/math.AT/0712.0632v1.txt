We determine all finite maximal elementary abelian group actions on compact oriented surfaces of genus \sigma\geq 2 which are unique up to topological equivalence. For certain special classes of such actions, we determine group extensions which also define unique actions. In addition, we explore in detail one of the families of such surfaces considered as compact Riemann surfaces and tackle the classical problem of constructing defining equations.
