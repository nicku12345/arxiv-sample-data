This is a historical talk about the recent confluence of two lines of research in equivariant elliptic cohomology, one concerned with connected Lie groups, the other with the finite case. These themes come together in (what seems to me remarkable) work of N. Ganter, relating replicability of McKay-Thompson series to the theory of exponential cohomology operations.
