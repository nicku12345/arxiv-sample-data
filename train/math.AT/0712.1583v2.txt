Our main result is a generalization of Cappell's 5-dimensional splitting theorem. As an application, we analyze, up to internal s-cobordism, the smoothable splitting and fibering problems for certain 5-manifolds mapping to the circle. For example, these maps may have homotopy fibers which are in the class of finite connected sums of certain geometric 4-manifolds. Most of these homotopy fibers have non-vanishing second mod 2 homology and have fundamental groups of exponential growth, which are not known to be tractable by Freedman--Quinn topological surgery. Indeed, our key technique is topological cobordism, which may not be the trace of surgeries.
