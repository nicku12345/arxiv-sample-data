We study the construction and properties of the Gysin triangle in an axiomatic framework which covers triangulated mixed motives and MGl-modules over an arbitrary base S. This allows to define the Gysin morphism associated to a projective morphism between smooth S-schemes and prove duality for projective smooth S-schemes. As part of the construction, cobordism classes are considered and we give a proof of the Myschenko theorem generalized in our context - this in fact gives another proof of the latter theorem in classical stable homotopy through complex realization. Finally, these constructions apply to rigid cohomology through the notion of a mixed Weil theory introduced by D.-C. Cisinski and the author in another work.
