We investigate stable operations in supersingular elliptic cohomology using isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves over finite fields. Our main results provide a framework in which we give a conceptually simple proof of an elliptic cohomology version of the Morava change of rings theorem and also gives models for explicit stable operations in terms of isogenies and morphisms in certain enlarged isogeny categories. We relate our work to that of G. Robert on the Hecke algebra structure of the ring of supersingular modular forms.
