We prove that for any group of the cohomological dimension n the nth power of the Berstein class of the group is nontrivial. This allows to prove the following Berstein-Svarc theorem for all n:   Theorem. For a connected complex X with \dim X=\cat X=n, the nth power of the Berstein class of X is nontrivial.   Previously it was known for n\ge 3.   We also prove that, for every map f: M \to N of degree \pm 1 of closed orientable manifolds, the fundamental group of N is free provided that the fundamental group of M is.
