Let X be a finitistic space with its rational cohomology isomorphic to that of the wedge sum P^2(n)\vee S^{3n}  or S^{n} \vee S^{2n}\vee S^{3n}. We study continuous \mathbb{S}^1 actions on X and determine the possible fixed point sets up to rational cohomology depending on whether or not X is totally non-homologous to zero in X_{\mathbb{S}^1} in the Borel fibration X\hookrightarrow X_{\mathbb{S}^1} \longrightarrow B_{\mathbb{S}^1}. We also give examples realizing the possible cases.
