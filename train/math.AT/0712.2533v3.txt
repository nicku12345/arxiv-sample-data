Let L and N be two smooth manifolds of the same dimension. Let j\colon L\to T^*N be an exact Lagrange embedding. We denote the free loop space of X by \Lambda X. C. Viterbo constructed a transfer map (\Lambda j)^! \colon H^*(\Lambda L) \to H^*(\Lambda N). This transfer was constructed using finite dimensional approximation of Floer homology. In this paper we define a family of finite dimensional approximations and realize this transfer as a map of Thom spectra: (\Lambda j)_! \colon (\Lambda N)^{-TN} \to (\Lambda L)^{-TL+\eta}, where \eta is a virtual vector bundle classified by the tangential information of j.
