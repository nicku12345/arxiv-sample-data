We show that the motivic spectrum representing algebraic K-theory is a localization of the suspension spectrum of \mathbb{P}^\infty, and similarly that the motivic spectrum representing periodic algebraic cobordism is a localization of the suspension spectrum of BGL. In particular, working over \mathbb{C} and passing to spaces of \mathbb{C}-valued points, we obtain new proofs of the topological versions of these theorems, originally due to the second author. We conclude with a couple of applications: first, we give a short proof of the motivic Conner-Floyd theorem, and second, we show that algebraic K-theory and periodic algebraic cobordism are E_\infty motivic spectra.
