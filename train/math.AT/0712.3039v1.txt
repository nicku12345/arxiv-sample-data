In this paper, we generalize the equivariant homotopy groups or equivalently the Rhodes groups. We establish a short exact sequence relating the generalized Rhodes groups and the generalized Fox homotopy groups and we introduce \Gamma-Rhodes groups, where \Gamma admits a certain co-grouplike structure. Evaluation subgroups of \Gamma-Rhodes groups are discussed.
