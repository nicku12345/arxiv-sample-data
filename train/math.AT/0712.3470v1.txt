We present some results on n-dimensional compacta lying in n-dimensional products of compacta, in particular, in products of n 1-dimensional compacta. Most of our basic results are proven under the assumption that the compacta X admit essential maps into the n-sphere. The results of the present paper may be viewed as an extension of the theory developed so far by other authors.   First, we prove that if X is an n-dimensional compactum with H^n(X) \neq 0 that embeds in either a product of n curves or the nth symmetric product of a curve, then there exists an algebraically essential map of X into the n-torus. Consequently, there exist elements a_1,...,a_n in H^1(X) whose cup product is non-zero. Therefore, the rank of H^1(X) is at least n, and the category of X exceeds n. Next, we introduce some new classes of n-dimensional continua and show that embeddability of locally connected quasi n-manifolds into products of n curves also implies that the rank of H^1(X) is at least n. It follows that some 2-dimensional contractible polyhedra are not embeddable in products of two curves. On the other hand, we show that any collapsible 2-dimensional polyhedron can be embedded in a product of two trees. We answer a question posed by Cauty proving that closed surfaces embeddable in products of two curves can be also embedded in products of two graphs. We prove that no closed surface, different from the 2-torus, lying in a product of two curves is a retract of that product.
