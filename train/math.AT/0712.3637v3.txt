Let G be a compact connected Lie group and p : E\to \Sigma A be a principal G-bundle with a characteristic map \alpha : A\to G, where A=\Sigma A_{0} for some A_{0}. Let \{K_{i}{\to} F_{i-1}{\hookrightarrow} F_{i} \,|\, 1{\le} i {\le} n,\, F_{0}{=} \{\ast\} \; F_{1}{=} \Sigma{K_{1}} \; \text{and}\; F_{n}{\simeq} G \} be a cone-decomposition of G of length m and F'_{1}=\Sigma{K'_{1}} \subset F_{1} with K'_{1} \subset K_{1} which satisfy F_{i}F'_{1} \subset F_{i+1} up to homotopy for any i. Our main result is as follows: we have \operatorname{cat}(X) \le m{+}1, if firstly the characteristic map \alpha is compressible into F'_{1}, secondly the Berstein-Hilton Hopf invariant H_{1}(\alpha) vanishes in [A, \Omega F'_1{\ast}\Omega F'_1] and thirdly K_{m} is a sphere. We apply this to the principal bundle \mathrm{SO}(9)\hookrightarrow\mathrm{SO}(10)\to S^{9} to determine L-S category of \mathrm{SO}(10).
