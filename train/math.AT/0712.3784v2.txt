The goal of this paper is to ameliorate the sufficients conditions, already established by the first author so that the sum of the numbers of Betti, of 1-connected rational finite CW-complex, is higher than the dimension of his \mathbb Q-vectorial space of homotopy, we will present it in two aspects, one algebraic and another geometrical.
