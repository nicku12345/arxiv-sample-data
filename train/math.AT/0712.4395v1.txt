We use the fixed point arrangement technique developed by Goresky-MacPherson to calculate the part of the equivariant cohomology of the affine flag varieties generated by degree 2. This turns out to be a quadric cone. We also describe the spectrum of the full equivariant cohomology ring as an explicit geometric object. We use our results to show that the vertices of the moment map images of the affine flag varieties lie on a paraboloid.
