Let G be a finite group or a compact connected Lie group and let BG be its classifying space. Let \mathcal{L}BG:=map(S^1,BG) be the free loop space of BG i.e. the space of continuous maps from the circle S^1 to BG. The purpose of this paper is to study the singular homology H_*(\mathcal LBG) of this loop space. We prove that when taken with coefficients in a field the homology of \mathcal LBG is a homological conformal field theory. As a byproduct of our main theorem, we get a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure on the cohomology H^*(\mathcal LBG). We also prove an algebraic version of this result by showing that the Hochschild cohomology HH^*(S_* (G),S_*(G)) of the singular chains of G is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra.
