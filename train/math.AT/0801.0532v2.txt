We define a new E_{\infty} operad based on surfaces with foliations which contains E_k sub-operads. We construct CW models for these operads and provide applications of these models by giving actions on Hochschild complexes -thus making contact with string topology-, by giving explicit cell representatives for the Dyer-Lashof-Cohen operations for the 2-cubes and by constructing new \Omega spectra. The underlying novel principle is that we can trade genus in the surface representation vs. the dimension k of the little k-cubes.
