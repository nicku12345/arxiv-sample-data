In this paper a geometric approach toward stable homotopy groups of spheres, based on the Pontrjagin-Thom construction is proposed. From this approach a new proof of Hopf Invariant One Theorem by J.F.Adams for all dimensions except 15,31,63,127 is obtained.   It is proved that for n>127 in the stable homotopy group of spheres \Pi_n there is no elements with Hopf invariant one. The new proof is based on geometric topology methods. The Pontrjagin-Thom Theorem (in the form proposed by R.Wells) about the representation of stable homotopy groups of the real projective infinite-dimensional space (this groups is mapped onto 2-components of stable homotopy groups of spheres by the Khan-Priddy Theorem) by cobordism classes of immersions of codimension 1 of closed manifolds (generally speaking, non-orientable) is considered. The Hopf Invariant is expressed as a characteristic number of the dihedral group for the self-intersection manifold of an immersed codimension 1 manifold that represents the given element in the stable homotopy group. In the new proof the Geometric Control Principle (by M.Gromov) for immersions in a given regular homotopy classes based on Smale-Hirsch Immersion Theorem is required.
