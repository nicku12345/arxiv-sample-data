The notion of the geometrical \Z/2 \oplus \Z/2--control of self-intersection of a skew-framed immersion and the notion of the \Z/2 \oplus \Z/4-structure (the cyclic structure) on the self-intersection manifold of a \D_4-framed immersion are introduced. It is shown that a skew-framed immersion f:M^{\frac{3n+q}{4}} \looparrowright \R^n, 0 < q <<n (in the \frac{3n}{4}+\epsilon-range) admits a geometrical \Z/2 \oplus \Z/2--control if the characteristic class of the skew-framing of this immersion admits a retraction of the order q, i.e. there exists a mapping \kappa_0: M^{\frac{3n+q}{4}} \to \RP^{\frac{3(n-q)}{4}}, such that this composition I \circ \kappa_0: M^{\frac{3n+q}{4}} \to \RP^{\frac{3(n-q)}{4}} \to \RP^{\infty} is the characteristic class of the skew-framing of f. Using the notion of \Z/2 \oplus \Z/2-control we prove that for a sufficiently great n, n=2^l-2, an arbitrary immersed \D_4-framed manifold admits in the regular cobordism class (modulo odd torsion) an immersion with a \Z/2 \oplus \Z/4-structure. In the last section we present an approach toward the Kervaire Invariant One Problem.
