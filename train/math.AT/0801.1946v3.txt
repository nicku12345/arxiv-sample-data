For given closed orientable 3-manifolds M and N let \c{D}(M,N) be the set of mapping degrees from M to N. We address the problem: For which N, \c{D}(M,N) is finite for all M? The answer is known in Thurston's picture of closed orientable irreducible 3-manifolds unless the target is a non-trivial graph manifold. We prove that for each closed non-trivial graph manifold N, \c{D}(M,N) is finite for all graph manifold M.   The proof uses a recently developed standard forms of maps between graph manifolds and the estimation of the \widetilde{\rm PSL}(2,{\R})-volume for certain class of graph manifolds.
