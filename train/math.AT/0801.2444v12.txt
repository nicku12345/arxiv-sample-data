Let G be a compact connected Lie group with a maximal torus T\subsetG. In the context of Schubert calculus we obtain a canonical presentation for the integral cohomology ring H^{\ast}(G/T) of the complete flag manifold G/T.   The result have been applied in [15] to construct the integral cohomology ring H^{\ast}(G) in terms of Schubert classes on G/T, and in [16] to determine the structure of the modp cohomology H^{\ast}(G;F_{p}) as a Hopf algebra over the Steenrod algebra.
