Given a semisimple, compact, connected Lie group G with complexification G^c, we show there is a stable range in the homotopy type of the universal moduli space of flat connections on a principal G-bundle on a closed Riemann surface, and equivalently, the universal moduli space of semistable holomorphic G^c-bundles. The stable range depends on the genus of the surface. We then identify the homology of this moduli space in the stable range in terms of the homology of an explicit infinite loop space. Rationally this says that the stable cohomology of this moduli space is generated by the Mumford-Morita-Miller kappa-classes, and the ring of characteristic classes of principal G-bundles, H^*(BG). We then identify the homotopy type of the category of one-manifolds and surface cobordisms, each equipped with a flat G-bundle. We also explain how these results may be generalized to arbitrary compact connected Lie groups. Our methods combine the classical techniques of Atiyah and Bott, with the new techniques coming out of Madsen and Weiss's proof of Mumford's conjecture on the stable cohomology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.
