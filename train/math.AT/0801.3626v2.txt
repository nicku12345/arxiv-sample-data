A simplicial complex L on n vertices determines a subcomplex T_L of the n-torus, with fundamental group the right-angled Artin group G_L. Given an epimorphism \chi\colon G_L\to \Z, let T_L^\chi be the corresponding cover, with fundamental group the Artin kernel N_\chi. We compute the cohomology jumping loci of the toric complex T_L, as well as the homology groups of T_L^\chi with coefficients in a field \k, viewed as modules over the group algebra \k\Z. We give combinatorial conditions for H_{\le r}(T_L^\chi;\k) to have trivial \Z-action, allowing us to compute the truncated cohomology ring, H^{\le r}(T_L^\chi;\k). We also determine several Lie algebras associated to Artin kernels, under certain triviality assumptions on the monodromy \Z-action, and establish the 1-formality of these (not necessarily finitely presentable) groups.
