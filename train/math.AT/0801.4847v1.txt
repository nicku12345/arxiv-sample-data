We introduce partial formality and relate resonance with partial formality properties. For instance, we show that for finitely generated nilpotent groups that are k-formal, the resonance varieties are trivial up to degree k. We also show that the cohomology ring of a nilpotent k-formal group is generated in degree 1, up to degree k+1; this criterion is necessary and sufficient for 2-step nilpotent groups to be k-formal. We compute resonance varieties for Heisenberg-type groups and deduce the degree of partial formality for this class of groups.
