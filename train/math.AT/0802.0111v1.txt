This note records two results which were inexplicably omitted from our paper on Pin structures on low dimensional manifolds, [KT]. Kirby chose not to be listed as a coauthor.   A Pin^- structure on a surface F induces a quadratic enhancement of the mod 2 intersection form, q: H_1(F;Z/2Z) -> Z/4Z   Theorem 1.1 says that q vanishes on the kernel of the map in homology to a bounding 3-manifold. This is used by Kreck and Puppe (arXiv:0707.1599 [math.AT]) who refer for a proof to an email of the author to Kreck. A more polished and public proof seems desirable.   In [KT], section 6, a Pin^- structure is constructed on a surface F dual to w_2 in an oriented 4-manifold M^4. Theorem 2.1 says that q vanishes on the Poincare dual to the image of H^1(M^4;Z/2Z) in H^1(F;Z/2Z).
