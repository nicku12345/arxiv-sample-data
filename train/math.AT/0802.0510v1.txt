In the mid 1980's, Pete Bousfield and I constructed certain p--local `telescopic' functors Phi_n from spaces to spectra, for each prime p and each positive integer n. These have striking properties that relate the chromatic approach to homotopy theory to infinite loopspace theory: roughly put, the spectrum Phi_n(Z) captures the v_n periodic homotopy of a space Z.   Recently there have been a variety of new uses of these functors, suggesting that they have a central role to play in calculations of periodic phenomena. Here I offer a guide to their construction, characterization, application, and computation.
