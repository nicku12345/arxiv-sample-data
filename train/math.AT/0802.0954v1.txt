We develop model categories of rational equivariant spectra whose homotopy categories are equivalent to the category of rational equivariant cohomology theories. We prove that given an orthogonal decomposition of the unit in the rational Burnside ring, the model category of rational equivariant spectra decomposes into a product of localisations. We use this result to reprove the classification of rational equivariant cohomology theories for finite groups and to study such cohomology theories for the group O(2). We then concentrate on a split piece of the O(2) case and relate it to rational SO(2) equivariant spectra.
