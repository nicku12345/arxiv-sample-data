Closed oriented 4-manifolds with the same geometrically 2-dimensional fundamental group (satisfying certain properties) are classified up to s-cobordism by their w_2-type, equivariant intersection form and the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant. As an application, we obtain a complete homeomorphism classification of closed oriented 4-manifolds with solvable Baumslag-Solitar fundamental groups, including a precise realization result.
