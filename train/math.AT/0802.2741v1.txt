In this paper we study the Milnor fibrations associated to real analytic map germs \psi:(\mathbb{R}^{m},0) \to (\mathbb{R}^2,0) with isolated critical point at 0\in \mathbb{R}^{m}. The main result relates the existence of called Strong Milnor fibrations with a transversality condition of a convenient family of analytic varieties with isolated critical points at the origin 0\in \mathbb{R}^{m}, obtained by projecting the map germ \psi in the family L_{-\theta} of all lines through the origin in the plane \mathbb R^{2}.
