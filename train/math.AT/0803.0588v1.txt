We interpret mathematically the pair (master equation, solution of master equation) up to equivalence, as the pair (a presentation of a free triangular dga T over a combination operad O, dga map of T into C, a dga over O) up to homotopy equivalence of dgOa maps, see Definition 1. We sketch two general applications: I to the theory of the definition and homotopy theory of infinity versions of general algebraic structures including noncompact frobenius algebras and Lie bialgebras. Here the target C would be the total Hom complex between various tensor products of another chain complex B, C = HomB, O describes combinations of operations like composition and tensor product sufficient to describe the algebraic structure and one says that B has the algebraic structure in question. II to geometric systems of moduli spaces up to deformation like the moduli of J holomorphic curves. Here C is some geometric chain complex containing the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of the geometric problem. We also discuss analogues of homotopy groups and Postnikov systems for maps and impediments to using them related to linear terms in the master equation called anomalies.
