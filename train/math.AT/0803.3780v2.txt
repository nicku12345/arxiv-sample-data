For each integer q>0 there is a cohomology theory such that the zero cohomology group of a manifold N of dimension n is a certain group of cobordism classes of proper fold maps of manifolds of dimension n+q into N. We prove a splitting theorem for the spectrum representing the cohomology theory of fold maps. For even q, the splitting theorem implies that the cobordism group of fold maps to a manifold N is a sum of q/2 cobordism groups of framed immersions to N and a group related to diffeomorphism groups of manifolds of dimension q+1. Similarly, in the case of odd q, the cobordism group of fold maps splits off (q-1)/2 cobordism groups of framed immersions.   The proof of the splitting theorem gives a partial splitting of the homotopy cofiber sequence of Thom spectra in the Madsen-Weiss approach to diffeomorphism groups of manifolds.
