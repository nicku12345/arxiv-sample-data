Combining results of Wahl, Galatius--Madsen--Tillmann--Weiss and Korkmaz one can identify the homotopy-type of the classifying space of the stable non-orientable mapping class group N_\infty (after plus-construction). At odd primes p, the F_p-homology coincides with that of Q_0(HP^\infty_+), but at the prime 2 the result is less clear. We identify the F_2-homology as a Hopf algebra in terms of the homology of well-known spaces. As an application we tabulate the integral stable homology of N_\infty in degrees up to six.   As in the oriented case, not all of these cohomology classes have a geometric interpretation. We determine a polynomial subalgebra of H^*(N_\infty ; F_2) consisting of geometrically-defined characteristic classes.
