This paper is devoted to the classification of embeddings of higher dimensional manifolds. We study the case of embeddings S^p\times S^q\to S^m, which we call knotted tori. The set of knotted tori in the the space of sufficiently high dimension, namely in the metastable range m\ge p+3q/2+2, p\le q, which is a natural limit for the classical methods of embedding theory, has been explicitely described earlier. The aim of this note is to present an approach which allows for results in lower dimension.
