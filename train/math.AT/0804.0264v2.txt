Let G be a finite group. For a based G-space X and a Mackey functor M, a topological Mackey functor X\widetilde\otimes M is constructed, which will be called the stable equivariant abelianization of X with coefficients in M. When X is a based G-CW complex, X\widetilde\otimes M is shown to be an infinite loop space in the sense of \mathcal{G}-spaces. This gives a version of the RO(G)-graded equivariant Dold-Thom theorem. Applying a variant of Elmendorf's construction, we get a model for the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum HM. The proof uses a structure theorem for Mackey functors and our previous results.
