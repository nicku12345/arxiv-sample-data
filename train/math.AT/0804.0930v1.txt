If phi is a Pisot substitution of degree d, then the inflation and substitution homeomorphism Phi on the tiling space T_Phi factors via geometric realization onto a d-dimensional solenoid. Under this realization, the collection of Phi-periodic asymptotic tilings corresponds to a finite set that projects onto the branch locus in a d-torus. We prove that if two such tiling spaces are homeomorphic, then the resulting branch loci are the same up to the action of certain affine maps on the torus.
