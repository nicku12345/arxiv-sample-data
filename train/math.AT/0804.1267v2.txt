Recently Galatius, Madsen, Tillmann and Weiss identified the homotopy type of the classifying space of the cobordism category of embedded d-dimensional manifolds [7] for each positive integer d. Their result lead to a new proof of the generalized standard Mumford conjecture. We extend the main theorem of [7] to the case of cobordism categories of embedded d-dimensional manifolds with prescribed singularities, and explain the relation of singular cobordism categories to the bordism version of the Gromov h-principle.
