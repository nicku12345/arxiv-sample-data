In this note we present a work in progress whose main purpose is to establish a categorified version of sheaf theory. We present a notion of derived categorical sheaves, which is a categorified version of the notion of complexes of sheaves of modules on schemes, as well as its quasi-coherent and perfect versions. We also explain how ideas from derived algebraic geometry and higher category theory can be used in order to construct a Chern character for these categorical sheaves, which is a categorified version of the Chern character for perfect complexes with values in cyclic homology. Our construction uses in an essential way the derived loop space of a scheme X, which is a derived scheme whose theory of functions is closely related to cyclic homology of X. This work can be seen as an attempt to define algebraic analogs of elliptic objects and characteristic classes for them. The present text is an overview of a work in progress and details will appear elsewhere.
