We show that the intersection of three subgroups in a free group is related to the computation of the third homotopy group \pi_3. This generalizes a result of Gutierrez-Ratcliffe who relate the intersection of two subgroups with the computation of \pi_2. Let K be a two-dimensional CW-complex with subcomplexes K_1,K_2,K_3 such that K=K_1\cup K_2\cup K_3 and K_1\cap K_2\cap K_3 is the 1-skeleton K^1 of K. We construct a natural homomorphism of \pi_1(K)-modules  \pi_3(K)\to \frac{R_1\cap R_2\cap R_3}{[R_1,R_2\cap R_3][R_2,R_3\cap R_1][R_3,R_1\cap R_2]},  where R_i=ker\{\pi_1(K^1)\to \pi_1(K_i)\}, i=1,2,3 and the action of \pi_1(K)=F/R_1R_2R_3 on the right hand abelian group is defined via conjugation in F. In certain cases, the defined map is an isomorphism. Finally, we discuss certain applications of the above map to group homology.
