We define a quadratic form which gives an obstruction to embedding N^{4k+2} \subset \R^{6k+4} of a smooth highly connected manifold into Euclidean space, with sufficiently many nondegenerate sections of the normal bundle. As the main corollary we prove that no 14-connected (resp. 30-connected) stably parallelizable manifold N^{30} (resp. N^{62}) with Arf-Kervaire invariant one is smoothly embeddable into \R^{36} (resp. \R^{83}).
