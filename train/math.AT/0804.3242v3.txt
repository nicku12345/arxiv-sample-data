Not every singular homology class is the push-forward of the fundamental class of some manifold. In the same spirit, one can study the following problem: Which singular homology classes are the push-forward of the fundamental class of a given type of manifolds? In the present article, we show that the fundamental classes of negatively curved manifolds cannot be represented by a non-trivial product of manifolds. This observation sheds some light on the functorial semi-norm on singular homology given by products of compact surfaces.
