Two standard invariants used to study the fundamental group G of the complement X of a hyperplane arrangement are the Malcev completion of G and the cohomology groups of X with coefficients in rank one local systems. In this paper, we develop a tool that unifies these two approaches. This tool is the Malcev completion S_p of G relative to a homomorphism p from G into (C^*)^N. This is a prosolvable group that is tightly controlled by the cohomology groups of X with coefficients in rank one local systems. The prounipotent radical U_p of the relative completion S_p corresponds to a pronilpotent Lie algebra u_p. We provide an example of a hyperplane complement X for which this algebra is not quadratically presented. In addition, we show that if X is a hyperplane complement and Y is a subtorus of the character torus, then S_p is combinatorially determined for general p in Y. Finally, we show that the relative completion S_p is generally constant over subvarieties of the character torus.
