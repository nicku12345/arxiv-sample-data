Let f:G_{n,k}\longrightarrow G_{m,l} be any continuous map between any two distinct complex Grassmann manifolds of the same dimension where the target is not the complex projective space. We show that, for any given k,l, the degree of f is zero provided that m,n are sufficiently large. If the degree of f is \pm 1, we show that (m,l)=(n,k) and f is a homotopy equivalence. Also, we prove that the image under f^* of elements of a set of algebra generators of H^*(G_{m,l};\mathbb{Q}) is determined upto a sign, \pm, if the degree of f is non-zero. Our proofs cover the case of quaternionic Grassmann manifolds as well.
