Let (M,\omega) be a closed symplectic manifold and \textup{Ham}(M,\omega) the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of (M,\omega). Then the Seidel homomorphism is a map from the fundamental group of \textup{Ham}(M,\omega) to the quantum homology ring QH_*(M;\Lambda). Using this homomorphism we give a sufficient condition for when a nontrivial loop \psi in \textup{Ham}(M,\omega) determines a nontrivial loop \psi\times\textup{id}_N in \textup{Ham}(M\times N,\omega\oplus\eta), where (N,\eta) is a closed symplectic manifold such that \pi_2(N)=0.
