This article is devoted to the investigation of wrap groups of connected fiber bundles over the fields of real \bf R, complex \bf C numbers, the quaternion skew field \bf H and the octonion algebra \bf O. Cohomologies of wrap groups and their structure are investigated. Sheaves of wrap groups are constructed and studied. Moreover, twisted cohomologies and sheaves over quaternions and octonions are investigated as well.
