We consider the category of presheaves of Gamma-spaces, or equivalently, of Gamma-objects in simplicial presheaves. Our main result is the construction of stable model structures on this category parametrised by local model structures on simplicial presheaves. If a local model structure on simplicial presheaves is monoidal, the corresponding stable model structure on presheaves of Gamma-spaces is monoidal and satisfies the monoid axiom. This allows us to lift the stable model structures to categories of algebras and modules over commutative algebras.
