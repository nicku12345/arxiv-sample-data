Let M be a locally compact metric space endowed with a continuous flow \phi : M \times \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow M. Frequently an attractor K for \phi exists which is of interest, not only in itself but also the dynamics in its basin of attraction \mathcal{A}(K). In this paper the class of {\sl attractors with no external explosions}, which is intermediate between the well known {\sl stable attractors} and the extremely wild {\sl unstable attractors}, is studied. We are mainly interested in their cohomological properties, as well as in the strong relations which exist between their shape (in the sense of Borsuk) and the topology of the phase space.
