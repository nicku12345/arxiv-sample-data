Let C be a small category and k a field. There are two interesting mathematical subjects: the category algebra kC and the classifying space |C|=BC. We study the ring homomorphism HH*(kC) --> H*(|C|,k) and prove it is split surjective. This generalizes the well-known results for groups and posets. Based on this result, we construct a seven-dimensional category algebra whose Hochschild cohomology ring modulo nilpotents is not finitely generated, against a conjecture of Snashall and Solberg.
