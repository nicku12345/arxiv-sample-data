We show that the Conjecture of Voevodsky concerning slices of the algebraic cobordism spectrum MGL implies a general statement about the slices of motivic Landweber spectra. In particular it confirms the possible approach suggested by Voevodsky for the computation of the slices of the homotopy algebraic K-theory spectrum KGL via a Conner-Floyd isomorphism complementing Levine's unconditional proof of these slices over perfect fields. A similar result, and Voevodsky's conjecture over fields of char. 0, are also announced by Hopkins-Morel.
