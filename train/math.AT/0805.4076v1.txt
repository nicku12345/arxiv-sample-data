Twisted diagrams are "diagrams" with components in different categories. Structure maps are defined using auxiliary data which consists of functors relating the various categories to each other. Prime examples of the construction are spectra (in the sense of homotopy theory) and quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes. We develop the basic theory of twisted diagrams, and establish various model structures (which are well-known in special cases). We also introduce a notion of homotopy sheaves, a collection of local data which is compatible up to weak equivalence, and study basic properties of such objects. These objects occur in nature; for example, the notion of an Omega-spectrum fits into this framework. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a convenient reference for model structures on twisted diagrams, and for the language of sheaves and homotopy sheaves as defined here.
