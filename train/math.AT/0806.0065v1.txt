We give a self contained introduction to A_\infty-algebras, A_\infty-bimodules and maps between them. The case of A_\infty-bimodule-map between A and its dual space A^{*}, which we call \infty-inner-product, will be investigated in detail. In particular, we describe the graph complex associated to \infty-inner-product. In a later paper, we show how \infty-inner-products can be used to model the string topology BV-algebra on the free loop space of a Poincar\'e duality space.
