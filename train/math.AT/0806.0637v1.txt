A topological group is constructed which is homotopy equivalent to the pointed loop space of a path-connected Riemannian manifold M and which is given in terms of "composable small geodesics" on M. This model is analogous to J. Milnor's free group construction \cite{Milnor} which provides a model for the pointed loop space of a connected simplicial complex. Related function spaces are constructed from "composable small geodesics" which provide models for the free loop space of M as well as the space of continuous maps from a surface to M.
