We exhibit a triangulated category T having both products and coproducts, and a triangulated subcategory S of T which is both localizing and colocalizing, for which neither a Bousfield localization nor a colocalization exists. It follows that neither the category S nor its dual satisfy Brown representability. Our example involves an abelian category whose derived category does not have small Hom-sets.
