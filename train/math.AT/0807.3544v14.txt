In the present paper we describe topological obstructions to embedding of a (complex) matrix algebra bundle into a trivial one under some additional arithmetic condition on their dimensions. We explain a relation between this problem and some principal bundles with structure groupoid. Finally, we briefly discuss a relation of our results to the twisted K-theory.
