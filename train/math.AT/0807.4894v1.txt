This paper deals with the question of J.Morava on existence of canonical complex cobordism class of singular submanifold. We present several solutions of this question for X_r(\xi) -- the set of points where \dim\xi-r+1 generic sections of a complex vector bundle \xi are linearly dependent. The corresponding complex cobordism classes Q_r(\xi) and P_r(\xi) tend to have many nice properties, such as deformed sum formula, but they don't coincide with Chern classes c_r^U(\xi). They also have relation to the theory of IH-small resolutions.
