The Product Conjecture for the homological Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz invariants is proved over a field. Under certain hypotheses the Product Conjecture is shown to also hold over Z, even though D. Schuetz has recently shown that the Conjecture is false in general over Z. Our version over Z is applied in a joint paper with D. Kochloukova to derive new information about subgroups of Thompson's group F, namely that F has subgroups F_m which are not of type F_{m+1}.
