Suppose M is a finite simplicial complex and that for 0=t_0,t_1,...,t_r=1 we have a discrete Morse function F_{t_i}:M\to \zr. In this paper, we study the births and deaths of critical cells for the functions F_{t_i} and present an algorithm for pairing the cells that occur in adjacent slices. We first study the case where the triangulation of M is the same for each t_i, and then generalize to the case where the triangulations may differ. This has potential applications in data imaging, where one has function values at a sample of points in some region in space at several different times or at different levels in an object.
