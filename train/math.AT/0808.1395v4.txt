This book is expository and is in Russian. It is shown how in the course of solution of interesting geometric problems (close to applications) naturally appear main notions of algebraic topology (homology groups, obstructions and invariants, characteristic classes). Thus main ideas of algebraic topology are presented with minimal technicalities. Familiarity of a reader with basic notions of topology (such as 2-dimensional manifolds and vector fields) is desirable, although definitions are given at the beginning. The book is accessible to undergraduates and could also be an interesting easy reading for professional mathematicians.
