Cohen, Goresky and Ji showed that there is a Kunneth theorem relating the intersection homology groups I^{\bar p}H_*(X\times Y) to I^{\bar p}H_*(X) and I^{\bar p}H_*(Y), provided that the perversity \bar p satisfies rather strict conditions. We consider biperversities and prove that there is a K\"unneth theorem relating I^{\bar p,\bar q}H_*(X\times Y) to I^{\bar p}H_*(X) and I^{\bar q}H_*(Y) for all choices of \bar p and \bar q. Furthermore, we prove that the Kunneth theorem still holds when the biperversity p,q is "loosened" a little, and using this we recover the Kunneth theorem of Cohen-Goresky-Ji.
