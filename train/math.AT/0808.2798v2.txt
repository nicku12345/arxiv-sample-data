Working in a semi-abelian context, we use Janelidze's theory of generalised satellites to study universal properties of the Everaert long exact homology sequence. This results in a new definition of homology which does not depend on the existence of projective objects. We explore the relations with other notions of homology, and thus prove a version of the higher Hopf formulae. We also work out some examples.
