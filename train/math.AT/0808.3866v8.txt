This article explains and extends semialgebraic homotopy theory (developed by H. Delfs and M. Knebusch) to o-minimal homotopy theory (over a field). The homotopy category of definable CW-complexes is equivalent to the homotopy category of topological CW-complexes (with continuous mappings). If the theory of the o-minimal expansion of a field is bounded, then these categories are equivalent to the homotopy category of weakly definable spaces. Similar facts hold for decreasing systems of spaces. As a result, generalized homology and cohomology theories on pointed weak polytopes uniquely correspond (up to an isomorphism) to the known topological generalized homology and cohomology theories on pointed CW-complexes.
