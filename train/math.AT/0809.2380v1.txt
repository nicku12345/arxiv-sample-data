We introduce the notion of homotopy inner products for any cyclic quadratic Koszul operad \mathcal O, generalizing the construction already known for the associative operad. This is done by defining a colored operad \widehat{\mathcal O}, which describes modules over \mathcal O with invariant inner products. We show that \widehat{\mathcal O} satisfies Koszulness and identify algebras over a resolution of \widehat{\mathcal O} in terms of derivations and module maps. As an application we construct a homotopy inner product over the commutative operad on the cochains of any Poincar\'e duality space.
