We show that in closed string topology and in open-closed string topology with one D-brane, higher genus stable string operations are trivial. This is a consequence of Harer's stability theorem and related stability results on the homology of mapping class groups of surfaces with boundaries. In fact, this vanishing result is a special case of a general result which applies to all homological conformal field theories with a property that in the associated topological quantum field theories, the string operations associated to genus one cobordisms with one or two boundaries vanish. In closed string topology, the base manifold can be either finite dimensional, or infinite dimensional with finite dimensional cohomology for its based loop space. The above vanishing result is based on the triviality of string operations associated to homology classes of mapping class groups which are in the image of stabilizing maps.
