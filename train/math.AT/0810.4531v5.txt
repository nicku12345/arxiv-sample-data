Given a simply connected space X with the cohomology H^*(X;{\mathbb Z}_2) to be polynomial, we calculate the loop cohomology algebra H^*(\Omega X;{\mathbb Z}_2) by means of the action of the Steenrod cohomology operation Sq_1 on H^*(X;{\mathbb Z}_2). As a consequence we obtain that H^*(\Omega X;{\mathbb Z}_2) is the exterior algebra if and only if Sq_1 is multiplicatively decomposable on H^{\ast}(X;{\mathbb Z}_2). The last statement in fact contains a converse of a theorem of A. Borel.
