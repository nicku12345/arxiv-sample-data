Let \pi: E \to B be a fiber bundle with fiber having the mod 2 cohomology algebra of a real or a complex projective space and let \pi^{'}: E^{'} \to B be vector bundle such that \mathbb{Z}_2 acts fiber preserving and freely on E and E^{'}-0, where 0 stands for the zero section of the bundle \pi^{'}:E^{'} \to B. For a fiber preserving \mathbb{Z}_2-equivariant map f:E \to E^{'}, we estimate the cohomological dimension of the zero set Z_f = \{x \in E | f(x)= 0\}. As an application, we also estimate the cohomological dimension of the \mathbb{Z}_2-coincidence set A_f=\{x \in E | f(x) = f(T(x)) \} of a fiber preserving map f:E \to E^{'}.
