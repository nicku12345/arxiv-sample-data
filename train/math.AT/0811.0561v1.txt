We introduce Auslander-Reiten sequences for group algebras and give several recent applications. The first part of the paper is devoted to some fundamental problems in Tate cohomology which are motivated by homotopy theory. In the second part of the paper we interpret Auslander-Reiten sequences in the context of Galois theory and connect them to some important arithmetic objects.
