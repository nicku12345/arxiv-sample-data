In this paper we analyze the higher topological Hochschild homology of commutative Thom S-algebras. This includes the case of the classical cobordism spectra MO, MSO, MU, etc. We consider the homotopy orbits of the torus action on iterated topological Hochschild homology and we describe the relationship to topological Andre-Quillen homology.
