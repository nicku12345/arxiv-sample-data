The primary goal of this paper is to find a homotopy theoretic approximation to moduli spaces of holomorphic maps Riemann surfaces into complex projective space. There is a similar treatment of a partial compactification of these moduli spaces of consisting of irreducible stable maps in the sense of Gromov-Witten theory. The arguments follow those from a paper of G. Segal on the topology of the space of rational functions.
