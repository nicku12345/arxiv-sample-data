The fundamental groupoid of a locally 0 and 1-connected space classifies covering spaces, or equivalently local systems. When the space is topologically stratified Treumann, based on unpublished ideas of MacPherson, constructed an `exit category' (in the terminology of this paper, the `fundamental category') which classifies constructible sheaves, equivalently stratified etale covers. This paper generalises this construction to homotopically stratified sets, in addition showing that the fundamental category dually classifies constructible cosheaves, equivalently stratified branched covers.   The more general setting has several advantages. It allows us to remove a technical `tameness' condition which appears in Treumann's work; to show that the fundamental groupoid can be recovered by inverting all morphisms and, perhaps most importantly, to reduce computations to the two stratum case. This provides an approach to computing the fundamental category in terms of homotopy groups of strata and homotopy links. We apply these techniques to compute the fundamental category of symmetric products of R^2, stratified by collisions.   Two appendices explain the close relations respectively between filtered and pre-ordered spaces and between cosheaves and branched covers (technically locally-connected uniquely-complete spreads).
