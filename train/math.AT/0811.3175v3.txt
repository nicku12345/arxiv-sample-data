Given an appropriate diagram of left Quillen functors between model categories, one can define a notion of homotopy fiber product, but one might ask if it is really the correct one. Here, we show that this homotopy pullback is well-behaved with respect to translating it into the setting of more general homotopy theories, given by complete Segal spaces, where we have well-defined homotopy pullbacks.
