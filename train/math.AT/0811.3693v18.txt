In this paper we show that between PDE's and crystallographic groups there is an unforeseen relation. In fact we prove that integral bordism groups of PDE's can be considered extensions of crystallographic subgroups. In this respect we can consider PDE's as {\em extended crystals}. Then an algebraic-topological obstruction ({\em crystal obstruction}), characterizing existence of global smooth solutions for smooth boundary value problems, is obtained. Applications of this new theory to the Ricci-flow equation and Navier-Stokes equation are given that solve some well-known fundamental problems. These results, are also extended to singular PDE's, introducing ({\em extended crystal singular PDE's}). An application to singular MHD-PDE's, is given following some our previous results on such equations, and showing existence of (finite times stable smooth) global solutions crossing critical nuclear energy production zone.
