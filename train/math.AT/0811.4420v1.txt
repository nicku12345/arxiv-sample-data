We show that a conjecture by Lawson holds, that is, the inclusion from the Chow variety C_{p,d}(P^n) of all effective algebraic p-cycles of degree d in n-dimensional projective space to the space of effective algebraic p-cycles is 2d-connected. As a result, the homotopy and homology groups of C_{p,d}(P^n) are calculated up to 2d. We also show an analogous statement for Chow variety C_{p,d}(\P^n) over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic and compute their etale homotopy groups up to 2d.
