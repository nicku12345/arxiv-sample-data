We are interested in the relationship between the virtual cohomological dimension (or vcd) of a discrete group Gamma and the smallest possible dimension of a model for the classifying space of Gamma relative to its family of virtually cyclic subgroups. In this paper we construct a model for the virtually cyclic classifying space of the Heisenberg group. This model has dimension 3, which equals the vcd of the Heisenberg group. We also prove that there exists no model of dimension less than 3.
