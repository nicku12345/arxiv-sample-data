We present a study of quadratic operads for n-ary algebras and their dual for n odd. We will focus on the ternary case (i.e n=3). The aim is to underline the problem of computing the dual operad and the fact that this last is in general defined in the graded differential operad framework. We prove that the operad associated to 3-ary partially associative algebra is not Koszul. Recall that, if n is even, the operad of n-ary partially associative algebras is Koszul.
