We study the homotopy types of spaces of algebraic (rational) maps from real projective spaces into complex projective spaces. In a previous paper we have shown that the inclusion of the first space into the second one is a homotopy equivalence. In this paper we prove that the homotopy types of the terms of the natural "degree" filtration approximate closer and closer the homotopy type of the space of continuous maps and obtain bounds that describe the closeness of the approximation in terms of the degree. Moreover, we compute the homotopy groups of the spaces in low dimensions.
