Motivic characteristic classes of possibly singular algebraic varieties are homology class versions of motivic characteristics, not classes in the so-called motivic (co)homology. This paper is a survey on them with more emphasis on capturing infinitude finitely and on the motivic nature, in other words, the scissor relation or additivity.
