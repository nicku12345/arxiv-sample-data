Let \mathcal{F} be a compact Hausdorff foliation on a compact manifold. Let {E_2^{>0,\bullet}}=\oplus\{E_2^{p,q}\colon p>0,q\geq 0\} be the subalgebra of cohomology classes with positive transverse degree in the E_2 term of the spectral sequence of the foliation. We prove that the saturated transverse Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of \mathcal{F} is bounded below by the length of the cup product in {E_2^{>0,\bullet}}. Other cohomological bounds are discussed.
