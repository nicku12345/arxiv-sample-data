We introduce and study the notion of representation up to homotopy of a Lie algebroid, paying special attention to examples. We use representations up to homotopy to define the adjoint representation of a Lie algebroid and show that the resulting cohomology controls the deformations of the structure. The Weil algebra of a Lie algebroid is defined and shown to coincide with Kalkman's BRST model for equivariant cohomology in the case of group actions.
