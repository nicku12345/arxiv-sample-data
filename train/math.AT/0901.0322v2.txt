This paper belongs to a series devoted to the study of the cohomology of classifying spaces. Generalizing the Weil algebra of a Lie algebra and Kalkman's BRST model, here we introduce the Weil algebra W(A) associated to any Lie algebroid A. We then show that this Weil algebra is related to the Bott-Shulman-Stasheff complex (computing the cohomology of the classifying space) via a Van Est map and we prove a Van Est isomorphism theorem. As application, we generalize and find a simpler more conceptual proof of the main result of Bursztyn et.al. on the reconstructions of multiplicative forms and of a result of Weinstein-Xu and Crainic on the reconstruction of connection 1-forms. This reveals the relevance of the Weil algebra and Van Est maps to the integration and the pre-quantization of Poisson (and Dirac) manifolds.
