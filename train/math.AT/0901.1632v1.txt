We present some data on the cohomology of the motivic Steenrod algebra over an algebraically closed field. We discuss several features of the associated Adams spectral sequence, including the basic construction and convergence properties. The paper also deals with motivic versions of the May and Adams-Novikov spectral sequences.   It is shown how these tools can be used to give new proofs of some classical results in algebraic topology. Also, the considerations reveal the existence of certain "exotic" motivic homotopy classes which have no classical analogues.
