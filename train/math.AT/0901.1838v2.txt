The homotopy type and homotopy groups of some spectra TAF of topological automorphic forms associated to a unitary similitude group GU of type (1,1) are explicitly described in quasi-split cases. The spectrum TAF is shown to be closely related to the spectrum TMF in these cases, and homotopy groups of some of these spectra are explicitly computed.
