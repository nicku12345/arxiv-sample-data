We consider discontinuous operations of a group G on a contractible n-dimensional manifold X. Let E be a finite dimensional representation of G over a field k of characteristics 0. Let \mathcal{E} be the sheaf on the quotient space Y=G \setminus X associated to E. Let H^{\bullet}_{\textbf{!}}(Y;\mathcal{E}) be the image in H^{\bullet}(Y;\mathcal{E}) of the cohomology with compact support. In the cases where both H^{\bullet}_{\textbf{!}}(Y;\mathcal{E}) and H^{\bullet}_{\textbf{!}}(Y;\mathcal{E}^*) (\mathcal{E}^* being the the sheaf associated to the representation dual to E) are finite dimensional, we establish a non-degenerate duality between H^{m}_{\textbf{!}}(Y;\mathcal{E}) and H^{n-m}_{\textbf{!}}(Y;\mathcal{E}^{\ast}). We also show that this duality is compatible with Hecke operators.
