The notion of the \emph{homotopy type} of a topological stack has been around in the literature for some time. The basic idea is that an atlas X \to \mathfrak{X} of a stack determines a topological groupoid \mathbb{X} with object space X. The homotopy type of \mathfrak{X} should be the classifying space B \mathbb{X}. The choice of an atlas is not part of the data of a stack and hence it is not immediately clear why this construction of a homotopy type is well-defined, let alone functorial. The purpose of this note is to give an elementary construction of such a homotopy-type functor.
