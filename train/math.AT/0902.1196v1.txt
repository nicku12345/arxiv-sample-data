For a finitely generated discrete group \Gamma, the \Gamma-sectors of an orbifold Q are a disjoint union of orbifolds corresponding to homomorphisms from \Gamma into a groupoid presenting Q. Here, we show that the inertia orbifold and k-multi-sectors are special cases of the \Gamma-sectors, and that the \Gamma-sectors are orbifold covers of Leida's fixed-point sectors. In the case of a global quotient, we show that the \Gamma-sectors correspond to orbifolds considered by other authors for global quotient orbifolds as well as their direct generalization to the case of an orbifold given by a quotient by a Lie group. Furthermore, we develop a model for the \Gamma-sectors corresponding to a generalized loop space.
