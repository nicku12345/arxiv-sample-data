The symmetric homology of a unital algebra A over a commutative ground ring k is defined using derived functors and the symmetric bar construction of Fiedorowicz. For a group ring A = k[\Gamma], the symmetric homology is related to stable homotopy theory via HS_*(k[\Gamma]) \cong H_*(\Omega\Omega^{\infty} S^{\infty}(B\Gamma); k). Two chain complexes that compute HS_*(A) are constructed, both making use of a symmetric monoidal category \Delta S_+ containing \Delta S. Two spectral sequences are found that aid in computing symmetric homology. The second spectral sequence is defined in terms of a family of complexes, Sym^{(p)}_*. Sym^{(p)} is isomorphic to the suspension of the cycle-free chessboard complex \Omega_{p+1} of Vre\'{c}ica and \v{Z}ivaljevi\'{c}, and so recent results on the connectivity of \Omega_n imply finite-dimensionality of the symmetric homology groups of finite-dimensional algebras. Some results about the k\Sigma_{p+1}--module structure of Sym^{(p)} are devloped. A partial resolution is found that allows computation of HS_1(A) for finite-dimensional A and some concrete computations are included.
