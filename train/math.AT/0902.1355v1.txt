If G is a group acting properly by semisimple isometries on a proper CAT(0) space X, then we build models for the classifying spaces E_{vc} and E_{fbc} under the additional assumption that the action of G has a well-behaved collection of axes in X. (This hypothesis is described in the paper.) We conjecture that the latter hypothesis is satisfied in a large range of cases. Our classifying spaces resemble those created by Connolly, Fehrman, and Hartglass for crystallographic groups G.
