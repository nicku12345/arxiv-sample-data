Early in the history of higher homotopy algebra, it was realized that Massey products are homotopy invariants in a special sense, but it was the work of Tornike Kadeisvili that showed they were but a shadow of an A-infinity-structure on the homology of a differential graded algebra. Here we relate his work to that of Victor Gugenheim and K.T. (Chester) Chen.   This paper is a personal tribute to Tornike and the Georgian school of homotopy theory as well as to Gugenheim and Chen, who unfortunately are not with us to appreciate this convergence.
