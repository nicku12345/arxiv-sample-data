We show how the Atiyah-Singer family index theorem for both, usual and self-adjoint elliptic operators fits naturally into the framework of the Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss spectra. Our main theorem concerns bundles of odd-dimensional manifolds. Using completely functional-analytic methods, we show that for any smooth proper oriented fibre bundle E \to X with odd-dimensional fibres, the family index \ind (B) \in K^1 (X) of the odd signature operator is trivial. The Atiyah-Singer theorem allows us to draw a topological conclusion: the generalized Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss map \alpha: B \Diff^+ (M^{2m-1}) \to \loopinf \MTSO(2m-1) kills the Hirzebruch \cL-class in rational cohomology. If m=2, this means that \alpha induces the zero map in rational cohomology. In particular, the three-dimensional analogue of the Madsen-Weiss theorem is wrong. For 3-manifolds M, we also prove the triviality of \alpha: B \Diff^+ (M) \to \MTSO (3) in mod p cohomology in many cases. We show an appropriate version of these results for manifold bundles with boundary.
