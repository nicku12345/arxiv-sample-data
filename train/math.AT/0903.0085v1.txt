There are well known relations between braid groups and symmetric groups, between Artin-Briskorn braid groups and Coxeter groups. Inverse braid monoid the same way is related to the inverse symmetric monoid. In the paper we show that similar relations exist between the inverse braid monoid of type B and the inverse reflection monoid of type B. This gives a presentation of the last monoid.
