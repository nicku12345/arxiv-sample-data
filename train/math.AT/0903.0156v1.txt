M. Mahowald, in his work on b{\rm o}-resolutions, constructed a b{\rm o}-module splitting of the spectrum b{\rm o} \wedge b{\rm o} into a wedge of summands related to integral Brown-Gitler spectra. In this paper, a similar splitting of b{\rm o} \sm tmf is constructed. This splitting is then used to understand the b{\rm o}_*-algebra structure of b{\rm o}_* tmf and allows for a description of b{\rm o}^* tmf.
