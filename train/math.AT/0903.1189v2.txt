We study actions of discrete groups on contractible topological spaces in which either (1) all stabilizers lie in the family of subgroups of prime power order or (2) all stabilizers lie in the family of finite subgroups. We compare the classifying spaces for actions with stabilizers in these two families, the Kropholler hierarchies build on these two families, and group cohomology relative to these two families.
