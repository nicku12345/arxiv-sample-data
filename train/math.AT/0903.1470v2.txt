Let Aut(p) denote the topological monoid of self-fibre-homotopy equivalences of a fibration p:E\to B. We make a general study of this monoid, especially in rational homotopy theory. When E and B are simply connected CW complexes with E finite, we identify the rational Samelson Lie algebra of the identity component of Aut(p) as the homology of a certain DG Lie algebra of derivations arising from the Koszul-Sullivan model of p. We obtain related identifications for the rational homotopy groups of fibrewise mapping spaces and for the rationalization of a natural nilpotent subgroup of Aut(p).
