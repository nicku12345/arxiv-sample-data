We set up machinery for recognizing k-cellular modules and k-cellular approximations, where k is an R-module and R is either a ring or a ring-spectrum. Using this machinery we can identify the target of the Eilenberg-Moore cohomology spectral sequence for a fibration in various cases. In this manner we get new proofs for known results concerning the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence and generalize another result.
