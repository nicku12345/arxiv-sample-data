We give a rather general construction of double categories and so, under further conditions, double groupoids, from a structure we call a `double module'.   We also give a homotopical construction of a double groupoid from a triad consisting of a space, two subspaces, and a set of base points, under a condition which also implies that this double groupoid contains two second relative homotopy groups.
