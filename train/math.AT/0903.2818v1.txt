The construction of E infinity ring spaces and thus E infinity ring spectra from bipermutative categories gives the most highly structured way of obtaining the K-theory commutative ring spectra. The original construction dates from around 1980 and has never been superseded, but the original details are difficult, obscure, and slightly wrong. We rework the construction in a much more elementary fashion.
