Infinite loop space theory, both additive and multiplicative, arose largely from two basic motivations. One was to solve calculational questions in geometric topology. The other was to better understand algebraic K-theory. The Adams conjecture is intrinsic to the first motivation, and Quillen's proof of that led directly to his original, calculationally accessible, definition of algebraic K-theory. In turn, the infinite loop understanding of algebraic K-theory feeds back into the calculational questions in geometric topology. For example, use of infinite loop space theory leads to a method for determining the characteristic classes for topological bundles (at odd primes) in terms of the cohomology of finite groups. We explain just a little about how all that works, focusing on the central role played by E infinity ring spaces.
