We show the "non-existence" results are essential for all the previous known applications of the Bauer-Furuta stable homotopy Seiberg-Witten invariants. As an example, we present a unified proof of the adjunction inequalities.   We also show that the nilpotency phenomenon explains why the Bauer-Furuta stable homotopy Seiberg-Witten invariants are not enough to prove 11/8-conjecture.
