We consider a problem on the conditions of a compact Lie group G that the loop space of the p-completed classifying space be a p-compact group for a set of primes. In particular, we discuss the classifying spaces BG that are p-compact for all primes when the groups are certain subgroups of simple Lie groups. A survey of the p-compactness of BG for a single prime is included.
