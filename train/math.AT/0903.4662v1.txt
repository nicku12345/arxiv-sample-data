Let E(n) and T(m) for nonnegative integers n and m denote the Johnson-Wilson and the Ravenel spectra, respectively. Given a spectrum whose E(n)_*-homology is E(n)_*(T(m))/(v_1,...,v_{n-1}), then each homotopy group of it estimates the order of each homotopy group of L_nT(m). We here study the E(n)-based Adams E_2-term of it and present that the determination of the E_2-term is unexpectedly complex for odd prime case. At the prime two, we determine the E_{infty}-term for pi_*(L_2T(1)/(v_1)), whose computation is easier than that of pi_*(L_2T(1)) as we expect.
