We define secondary theories and characteristic classes for simplicial smooth manifolds generalizing Karoubi's multiplicative K-theory and multiplicative cohomology groups for smooth manifolds.   As a special case we get versions of the groups of differential characters of Cheeger and Simons for simplicial smooth manifolds.   Special examples include classifying spaces of Lie groups and Lie groupoids.
