The purpose of these notes is to provide an introduction to the Steenrod algebra in an algebraic manner avoiding any use of cohomology operations. The Steenrod algebra is presented as a subalgebra of the algebra of endomorphisms of a functor. The functor in question assigns to a vector space over a Galois field the algebra of polynomial functions on that vector space: the subalgebra of the endomorphisms of this functor that turns out to be the Steenrod algebra if the ground field is the prime field, is generated by the homogeneous components of a variant of the Frobenius map.
