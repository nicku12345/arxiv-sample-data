The symmetric homology of a unital associative algebra A over a commutative ground ring k, denoted HS_*(A), is defined using derived functors and the symmetric bar construction of Fiedorowicz. In this paper we show that HS_*(A) admits homology operations and a Pontryagin product structure making HS_*(A) an associative commutative graded algebra. This is done by finding an explicit E_{\infty} structure on the standard chain groups that compute symmetric homology.
