This paper extends the relation established for group cohomology by Green, Hunton and Schuster between chromatic phenomena in stable homotopy theory and certain natural subrings of singular cohomology. This exploits the theory due to Henn, Lannes and Schwartz of unstable algebras over the Steenrod algebra localized away from nilpotents.
