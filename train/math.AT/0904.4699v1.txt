Let X_{\bullet} denote a simplicial space. The purpose of this note is to record a decomposition of the suspension of the individual spaces X_n occurring in X_{\bullet} in case the spaces X_n satisfy certain mild topological hypotheses and where these decompositions are natural for morphisms of simplicial spaces. In addition, the summands of X_n which occur after one suspension are stably equivalent to choices of filtration quotients of the geometric realization |X_{\bullet}|. The purpose of recording these decompositions is that they imply decompositions of the single suspension of certain spaces of representations as well as other varieties and are similar to decompositions of suspensions of moment-angle complexes which appear in a different context.
