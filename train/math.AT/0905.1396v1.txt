For a simply connected CW-complex X, let \mathcal{E}(X) denote the group of homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalence of X and let \mathcal{E}_{\sharp}(X) be its subgroup of homotopy classes which induce the identity on homotopy groups. As we know, the quotient group \frac{\mathcal{E}(X)}{\mathcal{E}_{\sharp}(X)} can be identified with a subgroup of Aut(\pi_{*}(X)). The aim of this work is to determine this subgroup for rational spaces. We construct the Whitehead exact sequence associated with the minimal Sullivan model of X which allows us to define the subgroup \mathrm{Coh.Aut}(\mathrm{Hom}\big(\pi_{*}(X),\Bbb Q)\big) of self-coherent automorphisms of the graded vector space \mathrm{Hom}(\pi_*(X),\Bbb Q). As a consequence we establish that \mathcal{E}(X) / \mathcal{E}_{\sharp}(X) \cong \mathrm{Coh.Aut} (\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_*(X),\Bbb Q)). In addition, by computing the group \mathrm{Coh.Aut}\big(\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_{*}(X),\Bbb Q)\big), we give examples of rational spaces that have few self-homotopy equivalences.
