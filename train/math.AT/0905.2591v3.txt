Let A be a special homotopy G-algebra over a commutative unital ring \Bbbk such that both H(A) and \operatorname{Tor}_{i}^{A}(\Bbbk,\Bbbk) are finitely generated \Bbbk-modules for all i, and let \tau_{i}(A) be the cardinality of a minimal generating set for the \Bbbk-module \operatorname{Tor}_{i}^{A}(\Bbbk,\Bbbk). Then the set {\tau_{i}(A)}  is unbounded if and only if \tilde{H}(A) has two or more algebra generators. When A=C^{\ast}(X;\Bbbk) is the simplicial cochain complex of a simply connected finite CW-complex X, there is a similar statement for the "Betti numbers" of the loop space \Omega X. This unifies existing proofs over a field \Bbbk of zero or positive characteristic.
