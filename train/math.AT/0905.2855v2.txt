We study categories of d-dimensional cobordisms from the perspective of Tillmann and Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss. There is a category C_\theta of closed smooth (d-1)-manifolds and smooth d-dimensional cobordisms, equipped with generalised orientations specified by a fibration \theta : X \to BO(d). The main result of GMTW is a determination of the homotopy type of the classifying space BC_\theta. The goal of the present paper is a systematic investigation of subcategories D of C_\theta having classifying space homotopy equivalent to that of C_\theta, the smaller such D the better.   We prove that in most cases of interest, D can be chosen to be a homotopy commutative monoid. As a consequence we prove that the stable cohomology of many moduli spaces of surfaces with \theta-structure is the cohomology of the infinite loop space of a certain Thom spectrum. This was known for certain special \theta, using homological stability results; our work is independent of such results and covers many more cases.
