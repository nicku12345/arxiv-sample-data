Using the ku- and BP-theoretic versions of Astey's cobordism obstruction for the existence of smooth Euclidean embeddings of stably almost complex manifolds, we prove that, for e greater than or equal to \alpha(n)--the number of ones in the dyadic expansion of n--, the (2n+1)-dimensional 2^e-torsion lens space cannot be embedded in Euclidean space of dimension 4n-2\alpha(n)+1. A slightly restricted version of this fact holds for e<\alpha(n). We also give an inductive construction of Euclidean embeddings for 2^e-torsion lens spaces. Some of our best embeddings are within one dimension of being optimal.
