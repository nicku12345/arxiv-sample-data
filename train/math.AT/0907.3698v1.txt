One constructs minimal injective resolutions for certain unstable modules that appears to be the mod 2 cohomology of Thom spectra. The terms of the resolution are tensor products of Brown-Gitler modules and Steinberg modules introduced by S. Mitchell and S. Priddy. A combinatorial result of Andrews shows that the alternating sum of the Poincare series of the considered modules is zero. One gives homotopical applications of this result.
