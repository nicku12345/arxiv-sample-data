In this article we study a homotopy invariant cat(X,B,\xi) on a pair of finite CW complexes with respect to a continuous closed 1-form. This is a generalisation of a Lusternik-Schnirelmann category developed by Farber, studying the topology of a closed 1-form. The article establishes the connection with the original notion and obtains analogous results on critical points and homoclinic cycles. We also provide a similar cuplength lower bound for cat(X,B,\xi).
