We consider the problem of calculating the Hurewicz image of Mahowald's family \eta_i\in{_2\pi_{2^i}^S}. This allows us to identify specific spherical classes in H_*\Omega_0^{2^{i+1}-8+k}S^{2^i-2} for 0\leqslant k\leqslant 6. We then identify the type of the subalgebras that these classes give rise to, and calculate the A-module and R-module structure of these subalgebras. We shall the discuss the relation of these calculations to the Curtis conjecture on spherical classes in H_*Q_0S^0, and relations with spherical classes in H_*Q_0S^{-n}.
