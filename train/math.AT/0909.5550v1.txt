In a preceding article the authors and Tran Ngoc Nam constructed a minimal injective resolution of the mod 2 cohomology of a Thom spectrum. A Segal conjecture type theorem for this spectrum was proved. In this paper one shows that the above mentioned resolutions can be realized topologically. In fact there exists a family of cofibrations inducing short exact sequences in mod 2 cohomology. The resolutions above are obtained by splicing together these short exact sequences. Thus the injective resolutions are realizable in the best possible sense. In fact our construction appears to be in some sense an injective closure of one of Takayasu. It strongly suggests that one can construct geometrically (not only homotopically) certain dual Brown-Gitler spectra. Contents
