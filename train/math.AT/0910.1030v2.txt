The generalized Morita-Miller-Mumford classes of a smooth oriented manifold bundle are defined as the image of the characteristic classes of the vertical tangent bundle under the Gysin homomorphism. We show that if the dimension of the manifold is even, then all MMM-classes in rational cohomology are nonzero for some bundle. In odd dimensions, this is also true with one exception: the MMM-class associated with the Hirzebruch \cL-class is always zero. We also show a similar result for holomorphic fibre bundles.
