Let p:E -> B be a principal fibration with classifying map w:B -> C. It is well-known that the group [X,\Omega C] acts on [X,E] with orbit space the image of p_#, where p_#: [X,E] -> [X,B]. The isotropy subgroup of the map of X to the base point of E is also well-known to be the image of [X, \Omega B]. The isotropy subgroups for other maps e:X -> E can definitely change as e does.   The set of homotopy classes of lifts of f to the free loop space on B is a group. If f has a lift to E, the set p_#^{-1}(f) is identified with the cokernel of a natural homomorphism from this group of lifts to [X, \Omega C].   As an example, [X,S^2] is enumerated for X a 4-complex.
