In the stable homotopy groups   \pi_{q(p^n+p^m+1)-3}(S) of the sphere spectrum S localized at the prime p greater than three, J. Lin constructed an essential family \xi_{m,n} for n \geq m + 2 >5. In this paper, the authors show that the composite \xi_{m,n}\beta_{s}\in \pi_{q(p^n+p^m+sp+s)-5}(S) for 2 \leq s < p is non-trivial, where q=2(p-1) and \beta_s \in \pi_{q(sp+s-1)-2}(S) is the known \beta-family. We show our result by explicit combinatorial analysis of the (modified) May spectral sequence.
