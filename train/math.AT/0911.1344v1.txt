In this paper we constructs a new nontrivial family in the stable homotopy groups of spheres \pi_{p^nq+2pq+q-3}S which is of order p and is represented by k_0h_{n} \in Ext_A^{3,p^nq+2pq+q}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_p) in the Adams spectral sequence, where p\geq 5 is an odd prime, n\geq 3 and q=2(p-1). In the course of the proof, a new family of homotopy elements in \pi_{\ast}V(1) which is represented by \beta_{\ast}{i^{\prime}}_{\ast}i_{\ast}({h}_n)\in Ext_A^{2,p^nq+(p+1)q+1}(H^{\ast}V(1),\mathbb{Z}_p) in the Adams sequence is detected.
