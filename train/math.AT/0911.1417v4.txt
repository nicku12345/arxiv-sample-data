Let (\Omega^{\ast}(M), d) be the de Rham cochain complex for a smooth compact closed manifolds M of dimension n. For an odd-degree closed form H, there are a twisted de Rham cochain complex (\Omega^{\ast}(M), d+H_\wedge) and its associated twisted de Rham cohomology H^*(M,H). We show that there exists a spectral sequence \{E^{p, q}_r, d_r\} derived from the filtration F_p(\Omega^{\ast}(M))=\bigoplus_{i\geq p}\Omega^i(M) of \Omega^{\ast}(M), which converges to the twisted de Rham cohomology H^*(M,H). We also show that the differentials in the spectral sequence can be given in terms of cup products and specific elements of Massey products as well, which generalizes a result of Atiyah and Segal. Some results about the indeterminacy of differentials are also given in this paper.
