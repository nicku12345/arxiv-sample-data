Manfred Stelzer has pointed out that part of Corollary 4.5 of our paper "Topological nonrealization results via the Goodwillie tower approach to iterated loopspace homology" [Alg. Geo. Top. 8 (2008), 2109--2129] was not sufficiently proved, and, indeed, is likely incorrect as stated. This necessitates a little more argument to finish the proof of the main theorem of the original paper. The statement of this theorem, and all the examples, remain unchanged.
