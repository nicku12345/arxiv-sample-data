In this paper we study the spaces of q-tuples of points in a Euclidean space, without k-wise coincidences (configuration-like spaces). A transitive group action by permuting these points is considered, and some new upper bounds on the genus (in the sense of Krasnosel'skii--Schwarz and Clapp--Puppe) for this action are given. Some theorems of Cohen--Lusk type for coincidence points of continuous maps to Euclidean spaces are deduced.
