The Curtis conjecture predicts that the only spherical classes in H_*(Q_0S^0;\Z/2) are the Hopf invariant one and the Kervaire invariant one elements. We consider Sullivan's decomposition Q_0S^0=J\times\cok J where J is the fibre of \psi^q-1 (q=3 at the prime 2) and observe that the Curtis conjecture holds when we restrict to J. We then use the Bott periodicity and the J-homomorphism SO\to Q_0S^0 to define some generators in H_*(Q_0S^0;\Z/p), when p is any prime, and determine the type of subalgebras that they generate. For p=2 we determine spherical classes in H_*(\Omega^k_0J;\Z/2). We determine truncated subalgebras inside H_*(Q_0S^{-k};\Z/2). Applying the machinery of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence we define classes that are not in the image of by the J-homomorphism. We shall make some partial observations on the algebraic structure of H_*(\Omega^k_0\cok J;\Z/2). Finally, we shall make some comments on the problem in the case equivariant J-homomorphisms.
