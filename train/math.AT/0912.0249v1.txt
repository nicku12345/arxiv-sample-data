Starting with a Z-graded superconnection on a graded vector bundle over a smooth manifold M, we show how Chen's iterated integration of such a superconnection over smooth simplices in M gives an A-infinity functor if and only if the superconnection is flat. If the graded bundle is trivial, this gives a twisting cochain.   Very similar results were obtained by K.T. Chen using similar methods. This paper is intended to explain this from scratch beginning with the definition and basic properties of a connection and ending with an exposition of Chen's "formal connections" and a brief discussion of how this is related to higher Reidemeister torsion.
