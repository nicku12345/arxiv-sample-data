We give a complete description of the integral cohomology ring of the flag manifold E_8/T, where E_8 denotes the compact exceptional Lie group of rank 8 and T its maximal torus, by the method due to Borel and Toda. This completes the computation of the integral cohomology rings of the flag manifolds for all compact connected simple Lie groups.
