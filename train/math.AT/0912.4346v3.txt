It is well known that very special \Gamma-spaces and grouplike \E_\infty spaces both model connective spectra. Both these models have equivariant analogues. Shimakawa defined the category of equivariant \Gamma-spaces and showed that special equivariant \Gamma-spaces determine positive equivariant spectra. Costenoble and Waner showed that grouplike equivariant \E_\infty-spaces determine connective equivariant spectra.   We show that with suitable model category structures the category of equivariant \Gamma-spaces is Quillen equivalent to the category of equivariant \E_\infty spaces. We define the units of equivariant ring spectra in terms of equivariant \Gamma-spaces and show that the units of an equivariant ring spectrum determines a connective equivariant spectrum.
