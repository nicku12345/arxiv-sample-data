A Bott manifold is a closed smooth manifold obtained as the total space of an iterated \C P^1-bundle starting with a point, where each \C P^1-bundle is the projectivization of a Whitney sum of two complex line bundles. A \emph{\Q-trivial Bott manifold} of dimension 2n is a Bott manifold whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to that of (\CP^1)^n with \Q-coefficients. We find all diffeomorphism types of \Q-trivial Bott manifolds and show that they are distinguished by their cohomology rings with \Z-coefficients. As a consequence, we see that the number of diffeomorphism classes in \Q-trivial Bott manifolds of dimension 2n is equal to the number of partitions of n. We even show that any cohomology ring isomorphism between two \Q-trivial Bott manifolds is induced by a diffeomorphism.
