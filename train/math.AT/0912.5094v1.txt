We combine Lurie's generalization of the Hopkins-Miller theorem with work of Zink-Lau on displays to give a functorial construction of even-periodic commutative ring spectra, concentrated in chromatic layers 2 and above, associated to certain n by n invertible matrices with coefficients in Witt rings. This is applied to examples related to Lubin-Tate and Johnson-Wilson spectra. We also give a Hopf algebroid presentation of the moduli of p-divisible groups of height greater than or equal to 2.
