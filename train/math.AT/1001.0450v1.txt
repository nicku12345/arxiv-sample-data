Let X be a finitistic space having the mod 2 cohomology algebra of the product of two projective spaces. We study free involutions on X and determine the possible mod 2 cohomology algebra of orbit space of any free involution, using the Leray spectral sequence associated to the Borel fibration X \hookrightarrow X_{\mathbb{Z}_2} \longrightarrow B_{\mathbb{Z}_2}. We also give an application of our result to show that if X has the mod 2 cohomology algebra of the product of two real projective spaces (respectively complex projective spaces), then there does not exist any \mathbb{Z}_2-equivariant map from \mathbb{S}^k \to X for k \geq 2 (respectively k \geq 3), where \mathbb{S}^k is equipped with the antipodal involution.
