We give a classification of minimal algebras generated in degree 1, defined over any field \bk of characteristic different from 2, up to dimension 6. This recovers the classification of nilpotent Lie algebras over \bk up to dimension 6. In the case of a field \bk of characteristic zero, we obtain the classification of nilmanifolds of dimension less than or equal to 6, up to \bk-homotopy type. Finally, we determine which rational homotopy types of such nilmanifolds carry a symplectic structure.
