In this article, we investigate the functors from modules to modules that occur as the summands of tensor powers and the functors from modules to Hopf algebras that occur as natural coalgebra summands of tensor algebras. The main results provide some explicit natural coalgebra summands of tensor algebras. As a consequence, we obtain some decompositions of Lie powers over the general linear groups.
