We present a new technique for analyzing the v_0-Bockstein spectral sequence studied by Shimomura and Yabe. Employing this technique, we derive a conceptually simpler presentation of the homotopy groups of the E(2)-local sphere for p > 3. We identify and correct some errors in the original Shimomura-Yabe calculation. We deduce the related K(2)-local homotopy groups, and discuss their manifestation of Gross-Hopkins duality.
