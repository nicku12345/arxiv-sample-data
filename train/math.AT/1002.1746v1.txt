We investigate {\it Gottlieb map}s, which are maps f:E\to B that induce the maps between the Gottlieb groups \pi_n (f)|_{G_n(E)}:G_n(E)\to G_n(B) for all n, from a rational homotopy theory point of view.We will define the obstruction group O(f) to be a Gottlieb map and a numerical invariant o(f). It naturally deduces a relative splitting of E in certain cases. We also illustrate several rational examples of Gottlieb maps and non-Gottlieb maps by using derivation arguments in Sullivan models.
