Let f:X\to Y be a pointed map between connected   CW-complexes. As a generalization of the evaluation subgroup G_*(Y,X;f), we will define the {\it relaxed evaluation subgroup} {\mathcal G}_*(Y,X;f) in the homotopy group \pi_*(Y) of Y, which is identified with {\rm Im} \pi_*(\tilde{ev}) for the evaluation map \tilde{ev} :map(X,Y;f)\times X\to Y given by \tilde{ev} (h,x)=h(x). Especially we see by using Sullivan model in rational homotopy theory for the rationalized map f_{\Q} that {\mathcal G}_*(Y_{\Q},X_{\Q};f_{\Q})=\pi_*(Y)\otimes \Q if the map f induces an injection of rational homotopy groups. Also we compare it with more relaxed subgroups by several rationalized examples.
