An \'etale homotopy type T(X, z) associated to any pointed locally fibrant connected simplicial sheaf (X, z) on a pointed locally connected small Grothendieck site (\mc{C}, x) is studied. It is shown that this type T(X, z) specializes to the \'etale homotopy type of Artin-Mazur for pointed connected schemes X, that it is invariant up to pro-isomorphism under pointed local weak equivalences (but see \cite{Schmidt1} for an earlier proof), and that it recovers abelian and nonabelian sheaf cohomology of X with constant coefficients. This type T(X, z) is compared to the \'etale homotopy type T_b(X, z) constructed by means of diagonals of pointed bisimplicial hypercovers of x = (X, z) in terms of the associated categories of cocycles, and it is shown that there are bijections \pi_0 H_{\hyp}(x, y) \cong \pi_0 H_{\bihyp}(x, y) at the level of path components for any locally fibrant target object y. This quickly leads to natural pro-isomorphisms T(X, z) \cong T_b(X, z) in \Ho{\sSet_\ast}. By consequence one immediately establishes the fact that T_b(X, z) is invariant up to pro-isomorphism under pointed local weak equivalences. Analogous statements for the unpointed versions of these types also follow.
