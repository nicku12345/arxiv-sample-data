Let p be an odd prime, and fix integers m and n such that 0<m<n\leq (p-1)(p-2). We give a p-local homotopy decomposition for the loop space of the complex Stiefel manifold W_{n,m}. Similar decompositions are given for the loop space of the real and symplectic Stiefel manifolds. As an application of these decompositions, we compute upper bounds for the p-exponent of W_{n,m}. Upper bounds for p-exponents in the stable range 2m<n and 0<m\leq (p-1)(p-2) are computed as well.
