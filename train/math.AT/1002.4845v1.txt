As an application of the upper triangular technology method of (V.P. Snaith: {\em Stable homotopy -- around the Arf-Kervaire invariant}; Birkh\"{a}user Progress on Math. Series vol. 273 (April 2009)) it is shown that there do not exist stable homotopy classes of  {\mathbb RP}^{\infty} \wedge {\mathbb RP}^{\infty} in dimension 2^{s+1}-2 with s \geq 2 whose composition with the Hopf map to  {\mathbb RP}^{\infty} followed by the Kahn-Priddy map gives an element in the stable homotopy of spheres of Arf-Kervaire invariant one.
