Let R\subseteq \Bbb Q be a subring of the rationals and let p be the least prime (if none, p=\infty ) which is not invertible in R. For an R-local r-connected CW-complex X of dimension \leq \min(r+2p-3,rp-1), r\geq 1,  a complete homotopy invariant is constructed in terms of the loop space homology H_*(\Omega X). This allows us to classify all such R-local spaces up to homotopy with a fixed loop space homology.
