We compute the integral homology and cohomology groups of configuration spaces of two distinct points on a given real projective space. The explicit answer is related to the (known multiplicative structure in the) integral cohomology---with simple and twisted coefficients---of the dihedral group of order 8 (in the case of unordered configurations) and the elementary abelian 2-group of rank 2 (in the case of ordered configurations). As an application, we complete the computation of the symmetric topological complexity of real projective spaces of dimension 2^i + d for d=0,1,2.
