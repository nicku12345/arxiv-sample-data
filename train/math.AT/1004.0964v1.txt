We construct a free and transitive action of the group of bilinear forms Bil(I/I^2[1]) on the set of R-products on F, a regular quotient of an E-infinity ring spectrum R with F_* \cong R_*/I. We show that this action induces a free and transitive action of the group of quadratic forms QF(I/I^2[1]) on the set of equivalence classes of R-products on F. The characteristic bilinear form of F introduced by the authors in a previous paper is the natural obstruction to commutativity of F. We discuss the examples of the Morava K-theories K(n) and the 2-periodic Morava K-theories K_n.
