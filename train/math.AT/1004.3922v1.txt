Variations on the notions of Reedy model structures and projective model structures on categories of diagrams in a model category are introduced. These allow one to choose only a subset of the entries when defining weak equivalences, or to use different model categories at different entries of the diagrams. As a result, a bisimplicial model category that can be used to recover the algebraic K-theory for any Waldhausen subcategory of a model category is produced.
