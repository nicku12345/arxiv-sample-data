Let M be a connected, simply connected, closed and oriented manifold, and G a finite group acting on M by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms. In this paper we show an explicit ring isomorphism between the orbifold string topology of the orbifold [M/G] and the Hochschild cohomology of the dg-ring obtained by performing the smash product between the group G and the singular cochain complex of M.
