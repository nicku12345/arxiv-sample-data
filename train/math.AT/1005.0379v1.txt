We recall how a description of local coefficients that Eilenberg introduced in the 1940s leads to spectral sequences for the computation of homology and cohomology with local coefficients. We then show how to construct new equivariant analogues of these spectral sequences and give a worked example of how to apply them in a computation involving the equivariant Serre spectral sequence. This paper contains some of the material in the author's Ph.D. thesis, which also discusses some results of L. Gaunce Lewis on the cohomology of complex projective spaces and corrects some flaws in his paper.
