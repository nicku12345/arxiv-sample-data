Given a C_\infty coalgebra C_*, a strict dg Hopf algebra H_*, and a twisting cochain \tau:C_* \rightarrow H_* such that Im(\tau) \subset Prim(H_*), we describe a procedure for obtaining an A_\infty coalgebra on C_* \otimes H_*. This is an extension of Brown's work on twisted tensor products. We apply this procedure to obtain an A_\infty coalgebra model of the chains on the free loop space LM based on the C_\infty coalgebra structure of H_*(M) induced by the diagonal map M \rightarrow M \times M and the Hopf algebra model of the based loop space given by T(H_*(M)[-1]). When C_* has cyclic C_\infty coalgebra structure, we describe an A_\infty algebra on C_* \otimes H_*. This is used to give an explicit (non-minimal) A_\infty algebra model of the string topology loop product. Finally, we discuss a representation of the loop product in principal G-bundles.
