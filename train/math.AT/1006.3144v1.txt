In this paper some axiomatic generalization (function of open subsets) of the relative Lyusternik-Schnirelmann category is considered, incorporating the sectional category and the Schwarz genus as well. For this function and a given continuous map of the underlying space to a finite-dimensional metric space some lower bounds on the value of this function on the (neighborhood of) preimage of some point are given.
