Let R be an E_\infty-ring spectrum. Given a map \zeta from a space X to BGL_1R, one can construct a Thom spectrum, X^\zeta, which generalises the classical notion of Thom spectrum for spherical fibrations in the case R=S^0, the sphere spectrum. If X is a loop space (\simeq \Omega Y) and \zeta is homotopy equivalent to \Omega f for a map f from Y to B^2GL_1R, then the Thom spectrum has an A_\infty-ring structure. The Topological Hochschild Homology of these A_\infty-ring spectra is equivalent to the Thom spectrum of a map out of the free loop space of Y.   This paper considers the case X=S^1, R=K_p^\wedge, the p-adic K-theory spectrum, and \zeta = 1-p \in \pi_1BGL_1K_p^\wedge. The associated Thom spectrum (S^1)^\zeta is equivalent to the mod p K-theory spectrum K/p. The map \zeta is homotopy equivalent to a loop map, so the Thom spectrum has an A_\infty-ring structure. I will compute \pi_*THH^{K_p^\wedge}(K/p) using its description as a Thom spectrum.
