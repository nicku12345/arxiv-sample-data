The intention of this article is to make an attempt of classification of transitive Lie algebroids and on this basis to construct a classifying space. The realization of the intention allows to describe characteristic classes of transitive Lie algebroids form the point of view a natural transformation of functors similar to the classical abstract characteristic classes for vector bundles.
