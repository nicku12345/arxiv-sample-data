Let X be a complete \Q-factorial toric variety of dimension n and \del the fan in a lattice N associated to X. For each cone \sigma of \del there corresponds an orbit closure V(\sigma) of the action of complex torus on X. The homology classes \{[V(\sigma)]\mid \dim \sigma=k\} form a set of specified generators of H_{n-k}(X,\Q). It is shown that, given \alpha\in H_{n-k}(X,\Q), there is a canonical way to express \alpha as a linear combination of the [V(\sigma)] with coefficients in the field of rational functions of degree 0 on the Grassmann manifold of (n-k+1)-planes in N_\Q. This generalizes Morelli's formula for \alpha the (n-k)-th component of the Todd homology class of the variety X.
