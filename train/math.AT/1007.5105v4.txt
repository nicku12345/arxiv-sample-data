We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the orientability of a locally standard 2-torus manifold with a fixed point which generalizes previous results of Nakayama-Nishimura in 2005 and Soprunova-Sottile in 2013. We construct manifolds with boundary where the boundary is a disjoint union of locally standard 2-torus manifolds. We discuss equivariant oriented cobordism class of locally standard 2-torus manifolds.
