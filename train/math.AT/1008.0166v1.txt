Let p be a prime. We calculate the connective unitary K-theory of the smash product of two copies of the classifying space for the cyclic group of order p, using a K\"{u}nneth formula short exact sequence. As a corollary, using the Bott exact sequence and the mod 2 Hurewicz homomorphism we calculate the connective orthogonal K-theory of the smash product of two copies of the classifying space for the cyclic group of order two.
