Let G be an exceptional Lie group with a maximal torus T. Based on Schubert calculus on the flag manifold G/T we have described the integral cohomology ring H*(G) by explicitely constructed generators in [DZ2], and determined the structure of H*(G;F_{p}) as a Hopf algebra over the Steenrod algebra in[DZ3]. In this sequel to [DZ2], [DZ3] we obtain the near--Hopf ring structure on H*(G).
