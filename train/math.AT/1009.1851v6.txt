We develop the properties of the n-th sequential topological complexity TC_n, a homotopy invariant introduced by the third author as an extension of Farber's topological model for studying the complexity of motion planning algorithms in robotics. We exhibit close connections of TC_n(X) to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of cartesian powers of X, to the cup-length of the diagonal embedding X\hookrightarrow X^n, and to the ratio between homotopy dimension and connectivity of X. We fully compute the numerical value of TC_n for products of spheres, closed 1-connected symplectic manifolds, and quaternionic projective spaces. Our study includes two symmetrized versions of TC_n(X). The first one, unlike Farber-Grant's symmetric topological complexity, turns out to be a homotopy invariant of X; the second one is closely tied to the homotopical properties of the configuration space of cardinality-n subsets of X. Special attention is given to the case of spheres.
