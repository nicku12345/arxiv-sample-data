We prove that if G is the circle group or a profinite group, then the all of the homotopical information of the category of rational G-spectra is captured by triangulated structure of the rational G-equivariant stable homotopy category. That is, for G profinite or S1, the rational G-equivariant stable homotopy category is rigid. For the case of profinite groups this rigidity comes from an intrinsic formality statement, so we carefully relate the notion of intrinsic formality of a differential graded algebra to rigidity.
