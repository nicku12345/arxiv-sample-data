This paper develops a basic theory of H-groups. We introduce a special quotient of H-groups and extend some algebraic constructions of topological groups to the category of H-groups and H-maps. We use these constructions to prove some advantages in topological homotopy groups. Also, we present a family of spaces that their topological fundamental groups are indiscrete topological group and find out a family of spaces whose topological fundamental group is a topological group.
