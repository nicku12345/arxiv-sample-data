In this note we define fibrations of topological stacks and establish their main properties. We prove various standard results about fibrations (fiber homotopy exact sequence, Leray-Serre and Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences, etc.). We prove various criteria for a morphism of topological stacks to be a fibration, and use these to produce examples of fibrations. We prove that every morphism of topological stacks factors through a fibration and construct the homotopy fiber of a morphism of topological stacks. When restricted to topological spaces our notion of fibration coincides with the classical one.
