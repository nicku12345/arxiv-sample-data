Let X be a simply connected CW complex with finite rational cohomology. For the finite quotient set of rationalized orbit spaces of X obtained by almost free toral actions, {\mathcal T}_0(X)=\{[Y_i] \}, induced by an equivalence relation based on rational toral ranks, we order as [Y_i]<[Y_j] if there is a rationalized Borel fibration Y_i\to Y_j\to BT^n_{\Q} for some n>0. It presents a variation of almost free toral actions on X. We consider about the Hasse diagram {\mathcal H}(X) of the poset {\mathcal T}_0(X), which makes a based graph G{\mathcal H}(X), with some examples. Finally we will try to regard G{\mathcal H}(X) as the 1-skeleton of a finite CW complex {\mathcal T}(X) with base point X_{\Q}.
