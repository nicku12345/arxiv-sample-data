We prove a conjecture of Kontsevich which states that if A is an E_{d-1} algebra then the Hochschild cohomology object of A is the universal E_d algebra acting on A. The notion of an E_d algebra acting on an E_{d-1} algebra was defined by Kontsevich using the swiss cheese operad of Voronov. The degree 0 and 1 pieces of the swiss cheese operad can be used to build a cofibrant model for A as an E_{d-1}-A module. The theorem amounts to the fact that the swiss cheese operad is generated up to homotopy by its degree 0 and 1 pieces.
