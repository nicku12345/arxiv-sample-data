In this paper we study the relationship between the moment-angle complex Z_k and the Davis-Januskiewicz space DJ(K) for a class of complexes K named missing-face complexes. If K has n vertices we consider the homotopy fibration sequence Z_k --> DJ(K) --> M where M is a product of n copies of infinite complex projective space. We observe that for such K, Z_k is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres, and then show that under this equivalence the map Z_k --> DJ(K) is homotopic to a wedge sum of higher Whitehead products and iterated Whitehead products.
