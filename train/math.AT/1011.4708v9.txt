Normal maps between discrete groups N\rightarrow G were characterized [FS] as those which induce a compatible topological group structure on the homotopy quotient EN\times_N G. Here we deal with topological group (or loop) maps N\rightarrow G being normal in the same sense as above and hence forming a homotopical analogue to the inclusion of a topological normal subgroup in a reasonable way.   We characterize these maps by a compatible simplicial loop space structure on Bar_\bullet(N,G), invariant under homotopy monoidal functors, e.g. Localizations and Completions. In the course of characterizing homotopy normality, we define a notion of a "homotopy action" similar to an A_{\infty} action on a space, but phrased in terms of Segal's 'special \Delta-spaces' and seem to be of importance on its own right. As an application of the invariance of normal maps, we give a very short proof to a theorem of Dwyer and Farjoun namely that a localization by a suspended map of a principal fibration of connected spaces is again principal.
