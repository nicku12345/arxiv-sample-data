By an n-Hawaiian like space X we mean the natural inverse limit, \displaystyle{\varprojlim (Y_i^{(n)},y_i^*)}, where (Y_i^{(n)},y_i^*)=\bigvee_{j\leq i}(X_j^{(n)},x_j^*) is the wedge of X_j^{(n)}'s in which X_j^{(n)}'s are (n-1)-connected, locally (n-1)-connected, n-semilocally simply connected and compact CW spaces. In this paper, first we show that the natural homomorphism \displaystyle{\beta_n:\pi_n(X,*)\rightarrow \varprojlim \pi_n(Y_i^{(n)},y_i^*)} is bijection. Second, using this fact we prove that the topological n-homotopy group of an n-Hawaiian like space, \pi_n^{top}(X,x^*), is a topological group for all n\geq 2 which is a partial answer to the open question whether \pi_n^{top}(X,x^*) is a topological group for any space X and n\geq 1. Moreover, we show that \pi_n^{top}(X,x^*) is metrizable.
