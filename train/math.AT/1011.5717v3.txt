A solution to the Kervaire invariant problem is presented. We introduce the concepts of abelian structure on skew-framed immersions, bicyclic structure on \Z/2^{[3]}--framed immersions, and quaternionic-cyclic structure on \Z/2^{[4]}--framed immersions. Using these concepts, we prove that for sufficiently large n, n=2^{\ell}-2, an arbitrary skew-framed immersion in Euclidean n-space \R^n has zero Kervaire invariant. Additionally, for \ell \ge 12 (i.e., for n \ge 4094) an arbitrary skew-framed immersion in Euclidean n-space \R^n has zero Kervaire invariant if this skew-framed immersion admits a compression of order 16.
