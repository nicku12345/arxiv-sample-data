We analyze the homological behavior of the attaching maps in the 2-local Goodwillie tower of the identity evaluated at S^1. We show that they exhibit the same homological behavior as the James-Hopf maps used by N. Kuhn to prove the 2-primary Whitehead conjecture. We use this to prove a calculus form of the Whitehead conjecture: the Whitehead sequence is a contracting homotopy for the Goodwillie tower of S^1 at the prime 2.
