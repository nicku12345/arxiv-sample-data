Shape theory works nice for (Hausdorff) paracompact spaces, but for spaces with no separation axioms, it seems to be quite poor. However, for finite and locally finite spaces their weak homotopy type is rather rich, and is equivalent to the weak homotopy type of finite and locally finite polynedra, respectively. In the paper there is proposed a variant of shape theory called quasi-shape, which suits both paracompact and locally finite spaces, i.e. the quas-shape is isomorphic to the weak homotopy type for locally finite spaces, and is \natural-equivalent to the ordinary shape in the case of paracompact spaces.
