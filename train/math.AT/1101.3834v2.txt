Let G be a finite group and k be a field of characteristic p>0. A cohomology class \zeta \in H^n(G,k) is called productive if it annihilates \Ext^*_{kG}(L_{\zeta},L_{\zeta}). We consider the chain complex \bPz of projective kG-modules which has the homology of an (n-1)-sphere and whose k-invariant is \zeta under a certain polarization. We show that \zeta is productive if and only if there is a chain map \Delta: \bPz \to \bPz \otimes \bPz such that (\id \otimes \epsilon)\Delta\simeq \id and (\epsilon \otimes \id)\Delta \simeq \id. Using the Postnikov decomposition of \bPz \otimes \bPz, we prove that there is a unique obstruction for constructing a chain map \Delta satisfying these properties. Studying this obstruction more closely, we obtain theorems of Carlson and Langer on productive elements.
