Connected components of \Map(S^4,B\SU(2)) are the classifying spaces of gauge groups of principal \SU(2)-bundles over S^4. Tsukuda [Tsu01] has investigated the homotopy types of connected components of \Map(S^4,B\SU(2)). But unfortunately, the proof of Lemma 2.4 in [Tsu01] is not correct for p=2. In this paper, we give a complete proof. Moreover, we investigate the further divisibility of \epsilon_i defined in [Tsu01]. In [Tsu], it is shown that divisibility of \epsilon_i have some information about A_i-equivalence types of the gauge groups.
