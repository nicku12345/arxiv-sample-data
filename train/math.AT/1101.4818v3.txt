We show that for any compact Lie group G with identity component N and component group W=G/N, the category of free rational G-spectra is equivalent to the category of torsion modules over the twisted group ring H^*(BN)[W]. This gives an algebraic classification of rational G-equivariant cohomology theories on free G-spaces and a practical method for calculating the groups of natural transformations between them.   This uses the methods of arXiv:1101.2511, and some readers may find the simpler context of the present paper highlights the main thread of the argument.
