Let M be a covariant coefficient system for a finite group G. In this paper we analyze several topological abelian groups, some of them new, whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the Bredon-Illman G-equivariant homology theory with coefficients in M. We call these groups equivariant Dold-Thom topological groups and we show that they are unique up to homotopy. We use one of the new groups to prove that the Bredon-Illman homology satisfies the infinite-wedge axiom and to make some calculations of the 0th equivariant homology.
