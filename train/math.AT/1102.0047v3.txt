We show that the tensor product of two cyclic A_\infty-algebras is, in general, not a cyclic A_\infty-algebra, but an A_\infty-algebra with homotopy inner product. More precisely, we construct an explicit combinatorial diagonal on the pairahedra, which are contractible polytopes controlling the combinatorial structure of an A_\infty-algebra with homotopy inner products, and use it to define a categorically closed tensor product. A cyclic A_\infty-algebra can be thought of as an A_\infty-algebra with homotopy inner products whose higher inner products are trivial. However, the higher inner products on the tensor product of cyclic A_\infty-algebras are not necessarily trivial.
