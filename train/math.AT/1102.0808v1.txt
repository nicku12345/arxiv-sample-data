The question of the existence of Universal homotopy commutative and homotopy associative H-spaces (called Abelian H-spaces) is studied. Such a space T(X) would prolong a map from X into an Abelian H-space to a unique H-map from T into X. Examples of such pairs (X,T) are given and conditions are discussed which limit the possible spaces X for which such a T can exist. The Anick spaces are shown not to be universal Abelian H-spaces for the corresponding Moore spaces, but conditions are discussed which could lead to a universal property with respect to a more limited range of targets.
