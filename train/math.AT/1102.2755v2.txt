Is the cohomology of the classifying space of a p-compact group, with Noetherian twisted coefficients, a Noetherian module? This note provides, over the ring of p-adic integers, such a generalization to p-compact groups of the Evens-Venkov Theorem. We consider the cohomology of a space with coefficients in a module, and we compare Noetherianity over the field with p elements, with Noetherianity over the p-adic integers, in the case when the fundamental group is a finite p-group.
