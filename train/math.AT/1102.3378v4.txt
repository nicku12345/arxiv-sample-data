B. Schuster \cite{SCH1} proved that the mod 2 Morava K-theory K(s)^*(BG) is evenly generated for all groups G of order 32. For the four groups G with the numbers 38, 39, 40 and 41 in the Hall-Senior list \cite{H}, the ring K(2)^*(BG) has been shown to be generated as a K(2)^*-module by transferred Euler classes. In this paper, we show this for arbitrary s and compute the ring structure of K(s)^*(BG). Namely, we show that K(s)^*(BG) is the quotient of a polynomial ring in 6 variables over K(s)^*(pt) by an ideal for which we list explicit generators.
