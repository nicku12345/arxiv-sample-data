This paper is a continuation of our previous work in which we defined the notion of a polytope complex and its K-theory. In this paper we produce formulas for the delooping of a simplicial polytope complex and the cofiber of a morphism of simplicial polytope complexes. Along the way we also prove that the (classical and higher) scissors congruence groups of polytopes in a homogeneous n-manifold (with sufficient geometric data) are determined by its local properties.
