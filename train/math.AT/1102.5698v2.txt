D.Sullivan (1977) (see also the book by H.Whitney "Geometric Integration Theory",1957) considered a new model for underlying cochain complex for classical cohomologies with rational coefficients for arbitrary simplicial spaces that gives the isomorphism with classical rational cohomologies. We apply the key ideas developed by K.MacKenzie (2005) and J.Kubarski (1991) to generalization of the D.Sullivan model for transitive Lie algebroids. The generalization is based on the existence of the inverse image of the transitive Lie algebroids and on the property of transitive Lie algebroids being trivial over contractible manifolds. Using these properties one can construct an underlying cochain complex of differential forms on simplicial space.
