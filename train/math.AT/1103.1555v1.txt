A careful account is given of generalized equivariant homology theories on the category of topological pairs acted on by a group. In particular, upon restriction to the category of equivariant simplicial complexes, the equivalence of equivariant simplicial homology (also known as Bredon homology), the second derived term of the Atiyah--Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and equivariant singular homology is demonstrated.
