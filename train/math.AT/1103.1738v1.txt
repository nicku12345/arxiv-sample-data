G. Conner and K. Eda (Topology and its Applications, 146, (2005), 317-328.) introduced a new construction of spaces from groups. They remarked that the construction is not categorical. In this paper, based on the work of Conner and Eda, we construct two new categories for which the functor of the fundamental group \pi has a right adjoint and consequently is right exact and preseves direct limits. Also, we study the behavior of the functor \pi on quotient spaces and give a new version of Van Kampen theorem for join of spaces in the new categories.
