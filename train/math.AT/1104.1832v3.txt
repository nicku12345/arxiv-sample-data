If a closed smooth manifold M with an action of a torus T satisfies certain conditions, then a labeled graph \mG_M with labeling in H^2(BT) is associated with M, which encodes a lot of geometrical information on M. For instance, the "graph cohomology" ring \mHT^*(\mG_M) of \mG_M is defined to be a subring of \bigoplus_{v\in V(\mG_M)}H^*(BT), where V(\mG_M) is the set of vertices of \mG_M, and is known to be often isomorphic to the equivariant cohomology H^*_T(M) of M. In this paper, we determine the ring structure of \mHT^*(\mG_M) with \Z (resp. \Z[1/2]) coefficients when M is a flag manifold of type A, B or D (resp. C) in an elementary way.
