Turaev and Turner introduced a bijection between unoriented topological quantum field theories and extended Frobenius algebras. In this paper, we will show that there exists a bijective correspondence between unoriented (1 + 1)-dimensional homotopy quantum field theories and extended crossed group algebras.
