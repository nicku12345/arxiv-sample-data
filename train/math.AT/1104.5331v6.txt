Complementing and extending the Inventiones work of Benson, Grodal, Henke [Group cohomology and control of p-fusion, Invent. Math. 197 (2014), 491--507] we give criteria for a space to have cohomology (strongly) F-isomorphic in the sense of Quillen to the stable elements. We extend results about groups models to fusion systems over discrete p-toral groups and profinite groups and provide various applications to the Kan-Thurston Theorem.
