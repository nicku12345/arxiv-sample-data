Let E_{d}(\ell) denote the space of all closed n-gons in \R^{d} (where d\ge 2) with sides of length \ell_1,..., \ell_n, viewed up to translations. The spaces E_d(\ell) are parameterized by their length vectors \ell=(\ell_1,..., \ell_n)\in \R^n_{>} encoding the length parameters. Generically, E_{d}(\ell) is a closed smooth manifold of dimension (n-1)(d-1)-1 supporting an obvious action of the orthogonal group {O}(d). However, the quotient space E_{d}(\ell)/{O}(d) (the moduli space of shapes of n-gons) has singularities for a generic \ell, assuming that d>3; this quotient is well understood in the low dimensional cases d=2 and d=3. Our main result in this paper states that for fixed d\ge 3 and n\ge 3, the diffeomorphism types of the manifolds E_{d}(\ell) for varying generic vectors \ell are in one-to-one correspondence with some combinatorial objects -- connected components of the complement of a finite collection of hyperplanes. This result is in the spirit of a conjecture of K. Walker who raised a similar problem in the planar case d=2.
