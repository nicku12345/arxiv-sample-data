In this paper we identify conditions under which the cohomology H^*(\Omega M\xi;\k) for the loop space \Omega M\xi of the Thom space M\xi of a spherical fibration \xi\downarrow B can be a polynomial ring. We use the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence which has a particularly simple form when the Euler class e(\xi)\in H^n(B;\k) vanishes, or equivalently when an orientation class for the Thom space has trivial square. As a consequence of our homological calculations we are able to show that the suspension spectrum \Sigma^\infty\Omega M\xi has a local splitting replacing the James splitting of \Sigma\Omega M\xi when M\xi is a suspension.
