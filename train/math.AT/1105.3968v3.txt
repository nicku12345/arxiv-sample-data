It has been observed that certain localizations of the spectrum of topological modular forms are self-dual (Mahowald-Rezk, Gross-Hopkins). We provide an integral explanation of these results that is internal to the geometry of the (compactified) moduli stack of elliptic curves  \M , yet is only true in the derived setting. When  2  is inverted, a choice of level  2  structure for an elliptic curve provides a geometrically well-behaved cover of  \M , which allows one to consider  Tmf  as the homotopy fixed points of  Tmf(2) , topological modular forms with level  2  structure, under a natural action by  GL_2(\Z/2) . As a result of Grothendieck-Serre duality, we obtain that  Tmf(2)  is self-dual. The vanishing of the associated Tate spectrum then makes  Tmf  itself Anderson self-dual.
