Denote by M(P) the configuration space of a planar polygonal linkage, that is, the space of all possible planar configurations modulo congruences, including configurations with self-intersections. A particular interest attracts its subset M^o(P) \subset M(P) of all configurations \emph{without} self-intersections. R. Connelly, E. Demaine, and G. Rote proved that M^o(P) is contractible and conjectured that so is its closure \bar{M^o(P)}. We disprove this conjecture by showing that a special choice of P makes the homologies H_k(\bar{M^o(P)}) non-trivial.
