In this note, we examine the right action of the Steenrod algebra \mathcal{A} on the homology groups H_*(BV_s, \F_2), where V_s = \F_2^s. We find a relationship between the intersection of kernels of Sq^{2^i} and the intersection of images of Sq^{2^{i+1}-1}, which can be generalized to arbitrary right \mathcal{A}-modules. While it is easy to show that \bigcap_{i=0}^{k} \mathrm{im}\,Sq^{2^{i+1}-1} \subseteq \bigcap_{i = 0}^k \mathrm{ker}\,Sq^{2^i} for any given k \geq 0, the reverse inclusion need not be true. We develop the machinery of homotopy systems and null subspaces in order to address the natural question of when the reverse inclusion can be expected. In the second half of the paper, we discuss some counter-examples to the reverse inclusion, for small values of k, that exist in H_*(BV_s, \F_2).
