We compute the integral cohomology ring of configuration spaces of two points on a given real projective space. Apart from an integral class, the resulting ring is a quotient of the known integral cohomology of the dihedral group of order 8 (in the case of unordered configurations, thus has only 2- and 4-torsion) or of the elementary abelian 2-group of rank 2 (in the case of ordered configurations, thus has only 2-torsion). As an application, we complete the computation of the symmetric topological complexity of real projective spaces of dimensions of the form 2^i+j for non-negative i and j with j<3.
