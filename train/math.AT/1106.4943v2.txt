In this paper we analyze some relationships between the topological complexity of a space X and the category of C_{\Delta_X}, the homotopy cofibre of the diagonal map \Delta_X:X\rightarrow X\times X. We establish the equality of the two invariants for several classes of spaces including the spheres, the H-spaces, the real and complex projective spaces and almost all the (standard) lens spaces.
