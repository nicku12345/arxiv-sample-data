In this paper we prove that the inductive cocategory of a nilpotent CW-complex of finite type X, \indcocat X, is bounded above by an expression involving the inductive cocategory of the p-localisations of X. Our arguments can be dualised to LS category improving previous results by Cornea and Stanley. Finally, we show that the inductive cocategory is generic for 1-connected H_0-spaces of finite type.
