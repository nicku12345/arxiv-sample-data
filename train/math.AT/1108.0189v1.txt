This survey discusses our results and conjectures concerning supersymmetric field theories and their relationship to cohomology theories. A careful definition of supersymmetric Euclidean field theories is given, refining Segal's axioms for conformal field theories. We state and give an outline of the proof of various results relating field theories to cohomology theories.
