Let M be a closed, oriented manifold. We prove that the quasi-isomorphism class of the Frob_\infty^0-bialgebra structure on H^*(M) induced by the open TFT on \Omega^*(M) is a homotopy invariant of the manifold. This is a three step process. First, we describe the Frob_\infty^0-bialgebra on H^*(M) induced by the partial Frob_\infty^0-bialgebra on \Omega^*(M). We then describe the Frob_\infty^0-bialgebra on H^*(M) induced by the cyclic C_\infty-algebra on H^*(M). Finally, we show these two Frob_\infty^0-bialgebras are the same. Since the cyclic C_\infty-algebra is a homotopy invariant, this proves our claim.
