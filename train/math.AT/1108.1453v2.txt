We study a certain construction designed to bring together the following two topics: i) Dyer--Lashof-operations in negative Tate-cohomology, ii) the description of negative Tate-cohomology in terms of joins. It has the merit of making (some) sense in a more general context: where the loop-space of the space under study no longer has to be of compact homotopy-type. The exposition given here is a streamlined version of a previous version of mine, available here at the Arxiv.
