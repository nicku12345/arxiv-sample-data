In previous work it is shown that there is an abelian category A(G) constructed to model rational G-equivariant cohomology theories, where G is a torus of rank r together with a homology functor \piA_* : Gspectra ---> A(G), and an Adams spectral sequence   Ext_{A (G)} (\piA_*(X), \piA_*(Y)) ===> [X,Y]^G_*   In joint work with Shipley (arxiv:1101.2511), it is shown that the Adams spectral sequence can be lifted to a Quillen equivalence   Rational-Gspectra = DG-A (G).   The purpose of the present paper is to prove that A(G) has injective dimension precisely r, and to construct certain torsion functors allowing us to make certain right adjoint constructions (such as products) in A(G). Along the way, we have an opportunity to prove a flatness result, and describe algebraic counterparts of some basic change of groups adjunctions.
