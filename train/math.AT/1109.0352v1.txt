We show that the space \tilde{A}_{d}(m,n) consisting of all real projective classes of (n+1)-tuples of real coefficients homogeneous polynomials of degree d in (m+1) variables, without common real roots except zero, has the same homology as the space  \Map(\RP^m,\Bbb \RP^n) of continuous maps from the m-dimensional real projective space \RP^m into the n real dimensional projective space \RP^n up to dimension %in dimensions smaller than (n-m)(d+1)-1. This considerably improves the main result of \cite{AKY1}.
