We prove that iterated Whitehead products of length (n+1) vanish in any value of an n-excisive functor in the sense of Goodwillie. We compare then different notions of homotopy nilpotency, from the Berstein-Ganea definition to the Biedermann-Dwyer one. The latter is strongly related to Goodwillie calculus and we analyze the vanishing of iterated Whitehead products in such objects.
