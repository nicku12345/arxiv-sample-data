We prove a conjecture of Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen and Gitler: if K is a shifted simplicial complex on n vertices, X_1,..., X_n are spaces and CX_i is the cone on X_i, then the polyhedral product determined by K and the pairs (CX_i,X_i) is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of suspensions of smashes of the X_i's. This generalises earlier work of the two authors in the special case where each X_i is a loop space. Connections are made to toric topology, combinatorics, and classical homotopy theory.
