We study the spectral sequence that one obtains by applying mod 2 homology to the Goodwillie tower which sends a spectrum X to the suspension spectrum of its 0th space X_0. This converges strongly to H_*(X_0) when X is 0-connected. The E^1 term is the homology of the extended powers of X, and thus is a well known functor of H_*(X), including structure as a bigraded Hopf algebra, a right module over the mod 2 Steenrod algebra A, and a left module over the Dyer-Lashof operations.   Hopf algebra considerations show that all pages of the spectral sequence are primitively generated, with primitives equal to a subquotient of the primitives in E^1.   We use an operad structure on the tower and the Z/2 Tate construction to show how Dyer-Lashof operations and differentials interact. These then determine differentials that hold for any spectrum X. These universal differentials then lead us to construct, for every A-module M, an algebraic spectral sequence depending functorially on M. The algebraic spectral sequence for H_*(X) agrees with the topological spectral sequence for X for many spectra, including suspension spectra and almost all generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectra, and appears to give an upper bound in general. The E^infty term of the algebraic spectral sequence has form and structure similar to E^1, but now the right A-module structure is unstable. Our explicit formula involves the derived functors of destabilization as studied in the 1980's by W. Singer, J. Lannes and S. Zarati, and P. Goerss.
