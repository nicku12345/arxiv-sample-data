We deform the Ravenel-Wilson computation of the Morava K-homology of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces to obtain a similar description of their completed Morava E-homology. This yields both a cohomological description and an interpretation on the level of formal schemes: the scheme associated to the E-cohomology of the space K(Z/p^infty, q) is the qth exterior power of the p-divisible group associated to the versal infinitesimally deformed formal group over Lubin-Tate space.
