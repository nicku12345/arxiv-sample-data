We shall introduce a notion of S^1-fibred nilBott tower. It is an iterated S^1-bundles whose top space is called an S^1-fibred nilBott manifold and the S^1-bundle of each stage realizes a Seifert construction. The nilBott tower is a generalization of real Bott tower from the viewpoint of fibration. In this note we shall prove that any S^1-fibred nilBott manifold is diffeomorphic to an infranilmanifold. According to the group extension of each stage, there are two classes of S^1-fibred nilBott manifolds which is defined as finite type or infinite type. We discuss their properties.
