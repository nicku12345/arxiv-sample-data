We show that in dimensions >1 the cohomology groups of the Higson compactification of the hyperbolic space \H^n with respect to the C_0 coarse structure are trivial.   Also we prove that the cohomology groups of the Higson compactification of \H^n for the bounded coarse structure are trivial in all even dimensions.
