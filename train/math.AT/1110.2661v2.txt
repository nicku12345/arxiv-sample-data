We prove that for generalised partitions of unity {\phi_i \mid i \in I} and coverings \mathfrak{U}:={\phi_i^{-1} (R \setminus {0}) \mid i \in I} of a topological space X the cohomology of abstract \mathfrak{U}-local cochains coincides with the cohomology of continuous \mathfrak{U}-local cochains, provided the coefficients are loop contractible. Furthermore we show that for each locally contractible group G and loop contractible coefficient group V the complex of germs of continuous functions on left-invariant diagonal neighbourhoods computes the Alexander-Spanier and singular cohomology; similar results are obtained for k-groups and for germs of smooth functions on Lie groups G.
