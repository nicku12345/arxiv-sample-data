We collect in one place a variety of known and folklore results in enriched model category theory and add a few new twists. The central theme is a general procedure for constructing a Quillen adjunction, often a Quillen equivalence, between a given V-model category and a category of enriched presheaves in V, where V is any good enriching category. For example, we rederive the result of Schwede and Shipley that reasonable stable model categories are Quillen equivalent to presheaf categories of spectra (alias categories of module spectra) under more general hypotheses. The technical improvements and modifications of general model categorical results given here are applied to equivariant contexts in a pair of sequels, where we indicate various directions of application.
