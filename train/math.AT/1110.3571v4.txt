Let G be a finite group. We give Quillen equivalent models for the category of G-spectra as categories of spectrally enriched functors from explicitly described domain categories to nonequivariant spectra. Our preferred model is based on equivariant infinite loop space theory applied to elementary categorical data. It recasts equivariant stable homotopy theory in terms of point-set level categories of G-spans and nonequivariant spectra. We also give a more topologically grounded model based on equivariant Atiyah duality.
