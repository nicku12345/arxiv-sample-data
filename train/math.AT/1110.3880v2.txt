Let G be a finite group and \mathcal{H} be a family of subgroups of G which is closed under conjugation and taking subgroups. Let B be a G-CW-complex whose isotropy subgroups are in \mathcal{H} and let \mathcal{F}= \{F_H\}_{H \in \mathcal{H}} be a compatible family of H-spaces. A G-fibration over B with fiber \mathcal{F}= \{F_H\}_{H \in \mathcal{H}} is a G-equivariant fibration p:E \rightarrow B where p^{-1}(b) is G_b-homotopy equivalent to F_{G_b} for each b \in B. In this paper, we develop an obstruction theory for constructing G-fibrations with fiber \mathcal{F}  over a given G-CW-complex B. Constructing G-fibrations with a prescribed fiber \mathcal{F} is an important step in the construction of free G-actions on finite CW-complexes which are homotopy equivalent to a product of spheres.
