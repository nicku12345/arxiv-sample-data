Let T be a torus and B a compact T-manifold. Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson show in \cite{GKM} that if B is (what was subsequently called) a GKM manifold, then there exists a simple combinatorial description of the equivariant cohomology ring H_T^*(B) as a subring of H_T^*(B^T). In this paper we prove an analogue of this result for T-equivariant fiber bundles: we show that if M is a T-manifold and \pi \colon M \to B a fiber bundle for which \pi intertwines the two T-actions, there is a simple combinatorial description of H_T^*(M) as a subring of H_T^*(\pi^{-1}(B^T)). Using this result we obtain fiber bundle analogues of results of \cite{GHZ} on GKM theory for homogeneous spaces.
