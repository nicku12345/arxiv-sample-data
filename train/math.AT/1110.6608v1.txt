Let \Lambda (\mathbb{C}P^n) denote the free loop space of the complex projective space \mathbb{C}P^n, i. e. \mathbb{C}P^n is the projective space of the vector space \mathbb{C}^{n+1} of dimension n+1 over the complex numbers \mathbb{C} and \Lambda(\mathbb{C}P^n) is the function space \mathrm{map}(S^1,\mathbb{C}P^n) of unbased maps from a circle S^1 into \mathbb{C}P^n topologized with the compact open topology. In this note we show that despite the fact that the natural fibration \Omega(\mathbb{C}P^n)\hookrightarrow \Lambda(\mathbb{C}P^n)\stackrel{eval}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{C}P^n has a cross section its Serre spectral sequence does not collapse: Here eval is the evaluation map at a base point * \in \mathbb{C}P^n.
