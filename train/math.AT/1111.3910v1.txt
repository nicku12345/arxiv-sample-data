We produce explicit geometric representatives of nontrivial homology classes in the space of long knots in R^d, when d is even. We generalize results of Cattaneo, Cotta-Ramusino and Longoni to define cycles which live off of the vanishing line of a homology spectral sequence due to Sinha. We use configuration space integrals to show our classes pair nontrivially with cohomology classes due to Longoni.
