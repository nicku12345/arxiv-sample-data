Weighted cup-length calculations in singular cohomology led Farber and Grant in 2008 to general lower bounds for the topological complexity of lens spaces. We replace singular cohomology by K-theory, and weighted cup-length arguments by considerations with biequivariant maps on spheres to improve on Farber-Grant's bounds by arbitrarily large amounts. Our calculations are based on the identification of key elements conjectured to generate the annihilator ideal of the toral bottom class in the ku-homology of the classifying space of a rank-2 abelian 2-group.
