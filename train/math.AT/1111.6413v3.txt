The category of I-spaces is the diagram category of spaces indexed by finite sets and injections. This is a symmetric monoidal category whose commutative monoids model all E-infinity spaces. Working in the category of I-spaces enables us to simplify and strengthen previous work on group completion and units of E-infinity spaces. As an application we clarify the relation to Gamma-spaces and show how the spectrum of units associated with a commutative symmetric ring spectrum arises through a chain of Quillen adjunctions.
