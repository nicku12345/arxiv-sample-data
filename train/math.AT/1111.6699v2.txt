In this article, we investigate the orbit configuration spaces of some equivariant closed manifolds over simple convex polytopes in toric topology, such as small covers, quasi-toric manifolds and (real) moment-angle manifolds; especially for the cases of small covers and quasi-toric manifolds. These kinds of orbit configuration spaces are all non-free and noncompact, but still built via simple convex polytopes. We obtain an explicit formula of Euler characteristic for orbit configuration spaces of small covers and quasi-toric manifolds in terms of the h-vector of a simple convex polytope. As a by-product of our method, we also obtain a formula of Euler characteristic for the classical configuration space, which generalizes the F\'elix-Thomas formula. In addition, we also study the homotopy type of such orbit configuration spaces. In particular, we determine an equivariant strong deformation retract of the orbit configuration space of 2 distinct orbit-points in a small cover or a quasi-toric manifold, which turns out that we are able to further study the algebraic topology of such an orbit configuration space by using the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence.
