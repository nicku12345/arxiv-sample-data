The paper is devoted to study the space of multiplicative maps from the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum H\Z to an arbitrary ring spectrum R. We try to generalize the approach of Schwede from "Formal groups and stable homotopy of commutative rings", where the special case of the mentioned above problem was solved in full generality. Among other results we propose a definition of a formal group law in any ring spectrum, which might be of interest in its own.
