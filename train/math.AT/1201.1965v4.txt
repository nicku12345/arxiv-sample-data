The paper is devoted to study the behavior of quasitopological homotopy groups on inverse limit spaces. More precisely, we present some conditions under which the quasitopological homotopy group of an inverse limit space and especially a product space is a topological group. Finally, we give some conditions for countability of homotopy groups.
