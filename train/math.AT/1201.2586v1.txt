We prove the following generalisation of Schauder's fixed point conjecture: Let C_1,...,C_n be convex subsets of a Hausdorff topological vector space. Suppose that the C_i are closed in C=C_1\cup...\cup C_n. If f:C\to C is a continuous function whose image is contained in a compact subset of C, then its Lefschetz number \Lambda(f) is defined. If \Lambda(f)\ne0, then f has a fixed point.
