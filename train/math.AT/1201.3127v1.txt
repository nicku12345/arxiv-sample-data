Baker and Richter construct a remarkable A_\infty ring-spectrum M\Xi whose elements possess characteristic numbers associated to quasisymmetric functions; its relations, on one hand to the theory of noncommutative formal groups, and on the other to the theory of omnioriented (quasi)toric manifolds [in the sense of Buchstaber, Panov, and Ray], seem worth investigating.
