The chromatic spectral sequence is introduced in \cite{mrw} to compute the E_2-term of the \ANSS\ for computing the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The E_1-term E_1^{s,t}(k) of the spectral sequence is an Ext group of BP_*BP-comodules. There are a sequence of Ext groups E_1^{s,t}(n-s) for non-negative integers n with E_1^{s,t}(0)=E_1^{s,t}, and Bockstein spectral sequences computing a module E_1^{s,*}(n-s) from E_1^{s-1,*}(n-s+1). So far, a small number of the E_1-terms are determined. Here, we determine the E_1^{1,1}(n-1)=\e^1M^1_{n-1} for p>2 and n>3 by computing the Bockstein spectral sequence with E_1-term E_1^{0,s}(n) for s=1,2. As an application, we study the non-triviality of the action of \alpha_1 and \beta_1 in the homotopy groups of the second Smith-Toda spectrum V(2).
