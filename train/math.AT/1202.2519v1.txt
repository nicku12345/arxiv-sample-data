Oka and the second author considered the cohomology of the second Morava stabilizer algebra to study nontriviality of the products of beta elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. In this paper, we use the cohomology of the third Morava stabilizer algebra to find nontrivial products of Greek letters of the stable homotopy groups of spheres: \al_1\ga_t, \be_2\ga_t, \lrk{\al_1,\al_1,\be_{p/p}^p}\ga_t\be_1 and \lrk{\be_1,p,\ga_t} for t with p\nmid t(t^2-1) for a prime number p>5.
