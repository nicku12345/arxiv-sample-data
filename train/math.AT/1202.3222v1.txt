The braid group B_g is embedded in the ribbon braid group that is defined to be the mapping class group \Gamma_{0,(g),1}. By gluing two copies of surface S_{0,g+2} along g+1 holes, we get surface S_{g,1}. A pillar switching is a self-homeomorphism of S_{g,1} which switches two pillars of surfaces by 180{}^\circ horizontal rotation. We analyze the actions of pillar switchings on \pi_1 S_{g,1} and then give concrete expressions of pillar switchings in terms of standard Dehn twists. The map \psi: B_g \rightarrow \Gamma_{g,1} sending the generators of B_g to pillar switchings on S_{g,1} is defined by extending the embedding B_g \hookrightarrow \Gamma_{0,(g+1),1}. We show that this map is injective by analyzing the actions of pillar switchings on \pi_1 S_{g,1}. The second part of this paper is to prove that this map induces a trivial homology homomorphism in the stable range. For the proof we use the categorical delooping. We construct a suitable monoidal 2-functor from tile category to surface category and show that this functor thus induces a map of double loop spaces.
