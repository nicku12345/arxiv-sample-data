Topological complexity \TC{B} of a space B is introduced by M. Farber to measure how much complex the space is, which is first considered on a configuration space of a motion planning of a robot arm. We also consider a stronger version \TCM{B} of topological complexity with an additional condition: in a robot motion planning, a motion must be stasis if the initial and the terminal states are the same. Our main goal is to show the equalities \TC{B} = \catBb{\double{B}}+1 and \TCM{B} = \catBB{\double{B}}+1, where \double{B}=B{\times}B is a fibrewise pointed space over B whose projection and section are given by p_{\double{B}}=\proj_{2} : B{\times}B \to B the canonical projection to the second factor and s_{\double{B}}=\Delta_{B} : B \to B{\times}B the diagonal. In addition, our method in studying fibrewise L-S category is able to treat a fibrewise space with singular fibres.   Recently, we found a problem with the proof of Theorem 1.13 which states that for a fibrewise well-pointed space X over B, we have \catBB{X} = \catBb{X} and that for a locally finite simplicial complex B, we have \TC{B} = \TCM{B}. While we still conjecture that Theorem 1.13 is true, this problem means that, at present, no proof is given to exist. Alternatively, we show the difference between two invariants \catBb{X} and \catBB{X} is at most 1 and the conjecture is true for some cases. We give further corrections mainly in the proof of Theorem 1.12.
