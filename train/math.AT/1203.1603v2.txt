We consider the rational vector space generated by all rational homology spheres up to orientation-preserving homeomorphism, and the filtration defined on this space by Lagrangian-preserving rational homology handlebody replacements. We identify the graded space associated with this filtration with a graded space of augmented Jacobi diagrams.
