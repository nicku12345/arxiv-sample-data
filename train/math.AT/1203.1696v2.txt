Previous work constructed a generalized truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum of chromatic height 2 at the prime 2 as an E_infinity-ring spectrum, based on the study of elliptic curves with level-3 structure. We show that the natural map forgetting this level structure induces an E_infinity-ring map from the spectrum of topological modular forms to this truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum, and that this orientation fits into a diagram of E_infinity-ring spectra lifting a classical diagram of modules over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra. In an appendix we document how to organize Morava's forms of K-theory into a sheaf of E_infinity-ring spectra.
