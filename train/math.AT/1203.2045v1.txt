With the idea of an eventual classification of 3-bridge links,\ we define a very nice class of 3-balls (called butterflies) with faces identified by pairs, such that the identification space is S^{3}, and the image of a prefered set of edges is a link. Several examples are given. We prove that every link can be represented in this way (butterfly representation). We define the butterfly number of a link, and we show that the butterfly number and the bridge number of a link coincide. This is done by defining a move on the butterfly diagram. We give an example of two different butterflies with minimal butterfly number representing the knot 8_{20}. This raises the problem of finding a set of moves on a butterfly diagram connecting diagrams representing the same link. This is left as an open problem.
