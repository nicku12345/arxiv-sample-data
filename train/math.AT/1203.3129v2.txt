In this paper, we prove that the Todd genus of a compact complex manifold X of complex dimension n with vanishing odd degree cohomology is one if the automorphism group of X contains a compact n-dimensional torus \Tn as a subgroup. This implies that if a quasitoric manifold admits an invariant complex structure, then it is equivariantly homeomorphic to a compact smooth toric variety, which gives a negative answer to a problem posed by Buchstaber-Panov.
