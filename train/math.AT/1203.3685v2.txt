We construct a model for cohomology of a space X equipped with a torus T action, whose homotopy orbit space X_{T} is formal. This model represents Koszul complex of its equivariant cohomology. Studying homological properties of modules over polynomial ring we derive new bounds on homological rank (dimension of cohomology ring) of X equipped with almost free torus action. We give a proof of toral rank conjecture for spaces with formal quotient in the case of torus dimension \le5.
