In "A Hosse diagram for rational toral tanks," we see a CW complex {\mathcal T}(X), which gives a rational homotopical classification of almost free toral actions on spaces in the rational homotopy type of X associated with rational toral ranks and also presents certain relations in them. We call it the {\it rational toral rank complex} of X. It represents a variety of toral actions. In this note, we will give effective 2-dimensional examples of it when X is a finite product of odd spheres. This is a combinatorial approach in rational homotopy theory.
