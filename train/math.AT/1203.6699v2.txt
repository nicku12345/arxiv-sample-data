Mishchenko's theorem states that piecewise smooth and Lie algebroid cohomology of a transitive Lie algebroid defined over a combinatorial manifold are isomorphic. In this paper, we describe two applications of that result. The first application consists in the relationship between piecewise de Rham cohomology of a Lie groupoid and piecewise smooth cohomology of its Lie algebroid. For the second application, we combine the classical result dealing with invariant cohomology in Lie algebroids with the Mishchenko's theorem.
