The author has already proven that the space \Delta(\Pi_n)/G is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension n-3 for all natural numbers n\geq 3 and all subgroups G\subset S_1\times S_{n-1}. We construct an S_1\times S_{n-1}-equivariant acyclic matching on \Delta(\Pi_n) together with a description of its critical simplices. This is also a more elementary approach to determining the number of spheres. We also develop new methods for Equivariant Discrete Morse Theory by adapting the Patchwork Theorem and poset maps with small fibers from Discrete Morse Theory.
