Kitchloo and Wilson have used the homotopy fixed points spectrum ER(2) of the classical complex-oriented Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(2) to deduce certain non-immmersion results for real projective spaces. ER(n) is a 2^{n+2}(2^n-1)-periodic spectrum. The key result to use is the existence of a stable cofibration \Sigma^{\lambda(n)}ER(n) \rightarrow ER(n) \rightarrow E(n) connecting the real Johnson-Wilson spectrum with the classical one. The value of \lambda(n) is 2^{2n+1}-2^{n+2}+1. We extend Kitchloo-Wilson's results on non-immersions of real projective spaces by computing the second real Johnson-Wilson cohomology ER(2) of the odd-dimensional real projective spaces RP^{16K+9}. This enables us to solve certain non-immersion problems of projective spaces using obstructions in ER(2)-cohomology.
