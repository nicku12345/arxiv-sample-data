Inspired by Stewart Priddy's cellular model for the p-local Brown-Peterson spectrum BP, we give a construction of a p-local E_\infty ring spectrum R which is a close approximation to BP. Indeed we can show that if BP admits an E_\infty structure then these are weakly equivalent as E_\infty ring spectra. Our inductive cellular construction makes use of power operations on homotopy groups to define homotopy classes which are then killed by attaching E_\infty cells.
