Using the theory of resolving classes, we show that if X is a CW complex of finite type such that \map_*(X, S^{2n+1})\sim * for all sufficiently large n, then \map_*(X, K) \sim * for every simply-connected finite-dimensional CW complex K; and under mild hypotheses on \pi_1(X), the same conclusion holds for \textit{all} finite-dimensional complexes K. Since it is comparatively easy to prove the former condition for X = B\ZZ/p (we give a proof in an appendix), this result can be applied to give a new, more elementary proof of the Sullivan conjecture.
