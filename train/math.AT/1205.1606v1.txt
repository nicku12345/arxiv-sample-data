The disjoint union of mapping class groups of surfaces forms a braided monoidal category \mathcal M, as the disjoint union of the braid groups \mathcal B does. We give a concrete, and geometric meaning of the braiding \beta_{r,s} in \M. Moreover, we find a set of elements in the mapping class groups which correspond to the standard generators of the braid groups. Using this, we obtain an obvious map \phi:B_g\ra\Gamma_{g,1}. We show that this map \phi is injective and nongeometric in the sense of Wajnryb. Since this map extends to a braided monoidal functor \Phi : \mathcal B \rightarrow \mathcal M, the integral homology homomorphism induced by \phi is trivial in the stable range.
