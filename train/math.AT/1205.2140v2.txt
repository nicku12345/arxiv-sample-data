We show that an f-localization functor L_f commutes with cofiber sequences of (N-1)-connected finite complexes if and only if its restriction to the collection of (N-1)-connected finite complexes is R-localization for some unital subring R\sseq\mathbb{Q}. This leads to a homotopy-theoretical characterization of the rationalization functor: the restriction of L_f to simply-connected spaces (not just the finite complexes) is rationalization if and only if L_f(S^2) is nontrivial and simply-connected, L_f preserves cofiber sequences of simply-connected finite complexes, and for each simply-connected finite complex K, \s^k L_f(K) splits as a wedge of copies of L_f(S^n) for large enough k and various values of n.
