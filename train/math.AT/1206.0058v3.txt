We introduce a variant of the slice spectral sequence which uses only regular slice cells, and state the precise relationship between the two spectral sequences. We analyze how the slice filtration of an equivariant spectrum that is concentrated over a normal subgroup is related to the slice filtration of its geometric fixed points, and use this to prove a conjecture of Hill on the slice filtration of an Eilenberg MacLane spectrum. We also show how the (co)connectivity of a spectrum results in the (co)connectivity of its slice tower, demonstrating the "efficiency" of the slice spectral sequence.
