For a discrete group G, we represent the Bredon cohomology with local coefficients as the homotopy classes of maps in the category of equivaraint crossed complexes. Subsequently, we construct a naive parametrized G-spectrum, such that the cohomology theory defined by it reduces to the Bredon cohomology with local coefficients when restricted to suspension spectra.
