We say that a simply connected space X is pre-c-symplectic if it is the fibre of a rational fibration X\to Y\to \C P^{\infty} where Y is cohomologically symplectic in the sense that there is a degree 2 cohomology class which cups to a top class. It is a rational homotopical property but not a cohomological one. By using Sullivan's minimal models, we give the necessary and sufficient condition that the product of odd-spheres X=S^{k_1}\times ... \times S^{k_n} is pre-c-symplectic and see some related topics. Also we give a charactarization of the Hasse diagram of rational toral ranks for a space X as a necessary condition to be pre-c-symplectic and see some examples in the cases of finite-oddly generated rational homotopy groups.
