In this paper, we compute the cohomology ring of all homology split polyhedral product spaces and the cohomology algebra over a field of all polyhedral product spaces. As an application, we give two polyhedral product spaces such that all the cohomology homomorphisms induced by inclusion map are the same, but the cohomology rings of the two polyhedral product spaces are not isomorphic.
