This note provides a reference for some properties of the Thom spectrum M\xi over \Omega\Sigma\CPi. Some of this material is used in recent work of Kitchloo and Morava. We determine the M\xi-cohomology of \CPi and show that M\xi^*(\CPi) injects into power series over the algebra of non-symmetric functions. We show that M\xi gives rise to a commutative formal group law over the non-commutative ring \pi_*M\xi. We also discuss how M\xi and some real and quaternionic analogues behave with respect to spectra that are related to these Thom spectra by splittings and by maps.
