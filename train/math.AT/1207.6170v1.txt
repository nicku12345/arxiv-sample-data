The main purpose of this note is to give a proof of the fact that the Toda brackets <\bar{\nu},\sigma,\bar{\nu}> and <\nu,\eta, \bar{\sigma}> are not trivial. This is an affirmative answer of the second author's Conjecture (Determination of the P-image by Toda brackets, Geometry and Topology Monographs 13(2008), 355-383). The second purpose is to show the relation \bar{\nu}_7\omega_{15}=\nu_7\sigma_{10}\kappa_{17} in \pi^7_{31}.
