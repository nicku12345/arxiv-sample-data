A general notion of detection is introduced and used in the study of the cohomology of elementary abelian 2-groups with respect to the spectra in the Postnikov tower of orthogonal K-theory. This recovers and extends results of Bruner and Greenlees and is related to calculations of the (co)homology of the spaces of the associated Omega-spectra by Stong and by Cowen Morton.
