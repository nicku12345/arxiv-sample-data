The classifying space of the embedded cobordism category has been identified in by Galatius, Tillmann, Madsen, and Weiss as the infinite loop space of a certain Thom spectrum. This identifies the set of path components with the classical cobordism group. In this paper, we give a geometric interpretation of the higher homotopy groups as certain cobordism groups where all manifolds are now equipped with a set of orthonormal sections in the tangent bundle. We also give a description of the fundamental group as a free group with a set of geometrically intuitive relations.
