For any vector bundle, we define an inverse system of spectra. In the case of a trivial bundle over a point, the homotopy groups of the filtration quotients give rise to the stable EHP spectral sequence, as was shown by Mahowald. The limit was determined by Lin. We also obtain a spectral sequence and show strong convergence in certain special cases. For compact base spaces, we obtain a generalization of Lin's theorem. In the case of the universal bundle over BO, we can also determine the limit by means of an Adams spectral sequence. This turns out to be quite different from the compact case. We also obtain partial results for the universal bundle over BSO.
