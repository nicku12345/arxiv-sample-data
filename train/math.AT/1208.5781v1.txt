If R is a commutative ring, M a compact R-oriented manifold and G a finite graph without loops or multiple edges, we consider the graph configuration space M^G and a Bendersky-Gitler type spectral sequence converging to the homology H_*(M^G, R). We show that its E_1 term is given by the graph cohomology complex C_A(G) of the graded commutative algebra A = H^*(M, R) and its higher differentials are obtained from the Massey products of A, as conjectured by Bendersky and Gitler for the case of a complete graph G. Similar results apply to the spectral sequence constructed from an arbitrary finite graph G and a graded commutative DG algebra \mathcal{A}.
