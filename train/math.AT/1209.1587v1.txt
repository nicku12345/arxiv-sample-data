The characteristic rank of a vector bundle \xi over a finite connected CW-complex X is by definition the largest integer k, 0\leq k\leq \mathrm{dim}(X), such that every cohomology class x\in H^j(X;\mathbb Z_2), 0\leq j\leq k, is a polynomial in the Stiefel-Whitney classes w_i(\xi). In this note we compute the characteristic rank of vector bundles over the Stiefel manifold V_k(\mathbb F^n), \mathbb F=\mathbb R,\mathbb C,\mathbb H.
