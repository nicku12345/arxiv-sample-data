In this paper, we show that for reduced homotopy endofunctors of spaces, F, and for all n \geq 1 there are adjoint functors R_n, L_n with T_n F \simeq R_n F L_n, where P_n F is the n-excisive approximation to F, constructed by taking the homotopy colimit over iterations of T_n F. This then endows T_n of the identity with the structure of a monad and the T_n F's are the functor version of bimodules over that monad. It follows that each T_n F (and P_nF) takes values in spaces of symmetric Lusternik-Schnirelman cocategory n, as defined by Hopkins. This also recovers recent results of Chorny-Scherer. The spaces T_n F(X) are in fact classically nilpotent (in the sense of Berstein-Ganea) but not nilpotent in the sense of Biedermann and Dwyer. We extend the original constructions of dual calculus to our setting, establishing the n-co-excisive approximation for a functor, and dualize our constructions to obtain analogous results concerning constructions T^n, P^n,and LS category.
