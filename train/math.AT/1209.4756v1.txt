In this paper we describe explicit L_\infty algebras modeling the rational homotopy type of any component of the spaces \map(X,Y) and \map^*(X,Y) of free and pointed maps between the finite nilpotent CW-complex X and the finite type nilpotent CW-complex Y. When X is of finite type, non necessarily finite, we also show that the algebraic covers of these L_\infty algebras model the universal covers of the corresponding mapping spaces.
