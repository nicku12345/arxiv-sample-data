Let E be the Whitney sum of complex line bundles over a topological space X. Then, the projectivization P(E) of E is called a \emph{projective bundle} over X. If X is a non-singular complete toric variety, so is P(E). In this paper, we show that the cohomology ring of a non-singular projective toric variety M determines whether it admits a projective bundle structure over a non-singular complete toric surface. In addition, we show that two 6-dimensional projective bundles over 4-dimensional quasitoric manifolds are diffeomorphic if their cohomology rings are isomorphic as graded rings. Furthermore, we study the smooth classification of higher dimensional projective bundles over 4-dimensional quasitoric manifolds.
