In 2009 Lurie published an expository article outlining a proof for a higher version of the cobordism hypothesis conjectured by Baez and Dolan in 1995. In this note we give a proof for the 1-dimensional case of this conjecture. The proof follows most of the outline given in Lurie's paper, but differs in a few crucial details. In particular, the proof makes use of the theory of quasi-unital \infty-categories as developed by the author in a previous note.
