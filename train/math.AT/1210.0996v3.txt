Lambrechts, Turchin and Voli\'c proved the Bousfield-Kan type rational homology spectral sequence associated to the d-th Kontsevich operad collapses at E^2-page if d\geq 4. The key of their proof is formality of the operad. In this paper, we simplify their proof using a model category of operads. As byproducts we obtain two new consequences. One is collapse of the spectral sequence in the case of d=3 (and the coefficients being rational numbers). The other says there is no non-trivial extension for the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the spectral sequence.
