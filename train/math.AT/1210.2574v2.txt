For any finite group G, we define the notion of a Bredon homotopy action of G, modelled on the diagram of fixed point sets (X_H)_{H\leq G} for a G-space X, together with a pointed homotopy action of the group N_{G}H/H on X^{H}/(\bigcup_{H<K} X^{K}). We then describe a procedure for constructing a suitable diagram \underline{X}:O_G^{op}\to Top from this data, by solving a sequence of elementary lifting problems. If successful, we obtain a G-space X' realizing the given homotopy information, determined up to Bredon G-homotopy type. Such lifting methods may also be used to understand other homotopy questions about group actions, such as transferring a G-action along a map f:X\to Y.
