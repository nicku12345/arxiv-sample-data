By using homotopy transfer techniques in the context of rational homotopy theory, we show that if C is a coalgebra model of a space X, then the A_\infty-coalgebra structure in H_*(X;\mathbb{Q})\cong H_*(C) induced by the higher Massey coproducts provides the construction of the Quillen minimal model of X. We also describe an explicit L_\infty-structure on the complex of linear maps {\rm Hom}(H_*(X; \mathbb{Q}), \pi_*(\Omega Y)\otimes\mathbb{Q}), where X is a finite nilpotent CW-complex and Y is a nilpotent CW-complex of finite type, modeling the rational homotopy type of the mapping space {\rm map}(X, Y). As an application we give conditions on the source and target in order to detect rational H-space structures on the components.
