Fix a prime p. Since their definition in the context of Localization Theory, the homotopy functors P_{B\Z/p} and CW_{B\Z/p} have shown to be powerful tools to understand and describe the mod p structure of a space. In this paper, we study the effect of these functors on a wide class of spaces which includes classifying spaces of compact Lie groups and their homotopical analogues. Moreover, we investigate their relationship in this context with other relevant functors in the analysis of the mod p homotopy, such as Bousfield-Kan completion and Bousfield homological localization.
