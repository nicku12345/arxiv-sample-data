We construct the homotopy pullback of A_n-spaces and show some universal property of it. As the first application, we review the Zabrodsky's result which states that for each prime p, there is a finite CW complex which admits an A_{p-1}-form but no A_p-form. As the second application, we investigate A_n-types of gauge groups. In particular, we give a new result on A_n-types of the gauge groups of principal \mathrm{SU}(2)-bundles over S^4, which is a complete classification when they are localized away from 2.
