For G a finite group, we define the G-cobordism category in dimension two. We prove this category has connected components in bijection with the abelianization of G and with fundamental group isomorphic to a lattice. We show the classifying space of this category has the homotopy type of the product of the abelianization of G, an infinite loop space and a finite product of circles. In addition, we study the classifying space of some important subcategories.
