For discrete groups, we construct two bounded cohomology classes with coefficients in the second space of the reduced real \ell_1-homology. Precisely, we associate to any discrete group G a bounded cohomology class of degree two noted \frak{g}_2\in H_b^2(G, \bar{H}_2^{\ell_1}(G, \mathbb R)). For G and \Pi groups and \theta : \Pi\rightarrow Out(G) any homomorphism we associate a bounded cohomology class of degree three noted [\theta]\in H_b^3(\Pi, \bar{H}_2^{\ell_1}(G, \mathbb R)). When the outer homomorphism \theta : \Pi\rightarrow Out(G) induces an extension of G by \Pi we show that the class \frak{g}_2 is \Pi-invariant and that the differential d_3 of Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence sends the class \frak{g}_2 on the class [\theta] : d_3(\frak{g}_2)=[\theta]. Moreover, we show that for any integer n\geq 0 the differential d_3 : E_3^{n, 2}\rightarrow E_3^{n+3, 0} of Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence in real bounded cohomology is given as a cup-product by the class [\theta].
