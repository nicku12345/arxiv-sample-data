Jim Stasheff gave two apparently distinct definitions of an A_{m} form, m \leq \infty in [15,16]. It is also claimed that the two definitions are equivalent in [15,16], while it is not apparently clear for us. That is why we are trying to clarify related things and to show that the claim is actually true under a `loop-like' hypothesis in this paper. Along with these two definitions, we must construct Associahedra and Multiplihedra as convex polytopes with piecewise-linearly decomposed faces to manipulate units in A_{\infty} form. This is done in Iwase [8,9], Iwase-Mimura [10] or by Haiman [7] especially on Associahedra, followed recently by Forcey [6] and Mau-Woodward [12], while the origin of Associahedra goes back to Tamari [17]. In this paper, we follow [10] on the geometric constructions of Associahedra and Multiplihedra. In Appendix, we also explain how we can construct Associahedra or Multiplihedra as polytopes on the (half) lattice by taking a shadow or collecting words from trivalent or bearded trees.
