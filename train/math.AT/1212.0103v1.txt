When the cohomology ring of a generalized Bott manifold with \mathbb{Q}-coefficient is isomorphic to that of a product of complex projective spaces \mathbb{C}P^{n_i}, the generalized Bott manifold is said to be \mathbb{Q}-trivial. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for a generalized Bott manifold to be \mathbb{Q}-trivial. In particular, every \mathbb{Q}-trivial generalized Bott manifold is diffeomorphic to a \prod_{n_i>1}\mathbb{C}P^{n_i}-bundle over a \mathbb{Q}-trivial Bott manifold.
