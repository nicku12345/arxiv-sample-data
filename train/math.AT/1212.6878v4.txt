We study the moduli space \mathfrak M_k^r(\tilde{\mathbb P}^2_{\!q}) of rank r holomorphic bundles with trivial determinant and second Chern class c_2=k, over the blowup \tilde{\mathbb P}^2_{\!q} of the projective plane at q points, trivialized on a rational curve. We show that, for k=1,2, we have a homotopy equivalence between \mathfrak M_k^r(\tilde{\mathbb P}^2_{\!q}) and the degree k component of the bar construction \mathrm{B}\bigl(\mathfrak M^r\mathbb P^2,(\mathfrak M^r\mathbb P^2)^{q},(\mathfrak M^r\tilde{\mathbb P}_{\!1}^2)^{q}\bigr).   The space \mathfrak M_k^r(\tilde{\mathbb P}^2_{\!q}) is isomorphic to the moduli space \mathfrak M\mathcal I_k^r(X_q) of charge k based SU(r) instantons on a connected sum X_q of q copies of \overline{\mathbb P^2} and we show that, for k=1,2, we have a homotopy equivalence between \mathfrak M\mathcal I_k^r(X_q\# X_s) and the degree k component of \mathrm{B}\bigl(\mathfrak M\mathcal I^r(X_q),\mathfrak M\mathcal I^r(S^4),\mathfrak M\mathcal I^r(X_s)\bigr). Analogous results hold in the limit when k\to\infty.   As an application we obtain upper bounds for the cokernel of the Atiyah-Jones map in homology, in the rank-stable limit.
