Localized at almost all primes, we describe the structure of differentials in several important spectral sequences that compute the cohomology of classifying spaces of topological Kac-Moody groups. In particular, we show that for all but a finite set of primes, these spectral sequences collapse and that there are no additive extension problems. We also describe some appealing consequences of these results. The main tool is the use of the naturality properties of unstable Adams operations on these classifying spaces.
