The paper is devoted to the study of coarse shape of Cartesian products of topological spaces. If the Cartesian product of two spaces X and Y admits an HPol-expansion, which is the Cartesian product of HPol-expansions of these spaces, then X\times Y is a product in the coarse shape category. As a consequence, the Cartesian product of two compact Hausdorff spaces is a product in the coarse shape category. Finally, we show that the shape groups and the coarse shape groups commute with products under some conditions.
