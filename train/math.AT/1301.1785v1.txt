F\'{e}lix and Thomas developed string topology of Chas and Sullivan on simply-connected Gorenstein spaces. In this paper, we prove that the degree shifted homology of the free loop space of a simply-connected {\mathbb Q}-Gorenstein space with rational coefficient is a non-unital and non-counital Frobenius algebra by solving the up to constant problem. We also investigate triviality or non-triviality of the loop product and coproduct of particular Gorenstein spaces.
