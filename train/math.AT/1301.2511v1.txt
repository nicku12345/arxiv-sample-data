Let S(V) be a complex linear sphere of a finite group G. %the space of unit vectors in a complex representation V of a finite group G. Let S(V)^{*n} denote the n-fold join of S(V) with itself and let \aut_G(S(V)^*) denote the space of G-equivariant self homotopy equivalences of S(V)^{*n}. We show that for any k \geq 1 there exists M>0 which depends only on V such that |\pi_k \aut_G(S(V)^{*n})| \leq M is for all n \gg 0.
