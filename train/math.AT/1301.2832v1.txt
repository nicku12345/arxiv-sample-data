The objective of this paper is to provide a fairly general model category context in which one can perform Goodwille Calculus.   There are two main parts to the paper, the first establishing general conditions which guarantee the existence of universal n-excisive approximations, and a second providing conditions for which the layers of the Goodwillie tower can be appropriately factored through the spectra categories.
