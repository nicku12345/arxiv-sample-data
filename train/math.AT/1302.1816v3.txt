We study the mod-2 cohomology spectral sequence arising from delooping the Bousfield-Kan cosimplicial space giving the 2-nilpotent completion of a connective spectrum X. Under good conditions its E_{2}-term is computable as certain non-abelian derived functors evaluated at H^*(X) as a module over the Steenrod algebra, and it converges to the cohomology of \Omega^\infty X. We provide general methods for computing the E_{2}-term, including the construction of a multiplicative spectral sequence of Serre type for cofibration sequences of simplicial commutative algebras. Some simple examples are also considered; in particular, we show that the spectral sequence collapses at E_{2} when X is a suspension spectrum.
