In this paper we will show that for any map f on an infra-nilmanifold, the Nielsen number N(f) of this map is either equal to |L(f)|, where L(f) is the Lefschetz number of that map, or equal to the expression |L(f)-L(f_+)|, where f_+ is a lift of f to a 2-fold covering of that infra-nilmanifold. By exploiting the exact nature of this relationship for all powers of f, we prove that the Nielsen dynamical zeta function for a map on an infra-nilmanifold is always a rational function.
