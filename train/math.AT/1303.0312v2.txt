The concept of assignments was introduced in [GGK99] as a method for extracting geometric information about group actions on manifolds from combinatorial data encoded in the infinitesimal orbit-type stratification. In this paper we will answer in the affirmative a question posed in [GGK99] by showing that the equivariant cohomology ring of M is to a large extent determined by this data.
