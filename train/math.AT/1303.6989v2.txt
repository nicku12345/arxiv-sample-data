Given a fixed object A in a suitable pointed simplicial model category \C, we study the problem of recovering the target Y from the pointed mapping space \w{\mapa(A,Y)} (up to A-equivalence). We describe a recognition principle, modelled on the classical ones for loop spaces, but using the more general notion of an \emph{\Ama[.]} It has an associated transfinite procedure for recovering \w{\CWA Y} from \w[,]{\mapa(A,Y)} inspired by Dror-Farjoun's construction of \ww{\CWA{}}-approximations.
