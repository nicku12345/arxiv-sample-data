Mishchenko-Oliveira proved the piecewise smooth cohomology and Lie algebroid cohomology of a Lie algebroid on a combinatorial compact manifold are isomorphic. In this paper, we describe an application of that result locally trivial Lie groupoids on combinatorial manifolds to obtain an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and piecewise de Rham cohomology of left invariants forms.
