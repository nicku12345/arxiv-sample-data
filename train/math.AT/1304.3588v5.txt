Let TMF_1(n) be the spectrum of topological modular forms equipped with a \Gamma_1(n)-structure. We compute the K(2)-local TMF_1(3)-cohomology of B{\mathit String} and B{\mathit Spin}: both are power series rings freely generated by classes that we explicitly construct and which generalize the classical Pontryagin classes. As a first application of this computation, we show how to construct TMF(3n)-cohomology classes from stable positive energy representations of the loop groups L{\mathit Spin}.
