We introduce singularities to Quinn spectra. It enables us to talk about ads with prescribed singularities and to explicitly construct representatives for prominent spectra like Morava K-theories or for L-theory with singularities. We develop a spectral sequence for the computation of the associated bordism groups and investigate product structures in the presence of singularities.
