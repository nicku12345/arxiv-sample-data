Let \bf C be a coreflective subcategory of a cofibrantly generated model category \bf D. In this paper we show that under suitable conditions \bf C admits a cofibrantly generated model structure which is left Quillen adjunct to the model structure on \bf D. As an application, we prove that well-known convenient categories of topological spaces, such as k-spaces, compactly generated spaces, and \Delta-generated spaces \cite{DN} (called numerically generated in \cite{KKH}) admit a finitely generated model structure which is Quillen equivalent to the standard model structure on the category \bf Top of topological spaces.
