Let \psi denote the genus that corresponds to the formal group law having invariant differential \omega(t) equal to \sqrt{1+p_1t+p_2t^2+p_3t^3+p_4t^4} and let \kappa classify the formal group law strictly isomorphic to the universal formal group law under strict isomorphism x\CP(x). We prove that on the rational complex bordism ring the Krichever-H\"ohn genus \phi_{KH} is the composition \psi\circ \kappa^{-1}. We construct certain elements A_{ij} in the Lazard ring and give an alternative definition of the universal Krichever formal group law. We conclude that the coefficient ring of the universal Krichever formal group law is the quotient of the Lazard ring by the ideal generated by all A_{ij}, i,j\geq 3.
