Let T^n be the real n-torus group. We give a new definition of lens spaces and study the diffeomorphic classification of lens spaces. We show that any 3-dimensional lens space L(p; q) is T^2-equivariantly cobordant to zero. We also give some sufficient conditions for higher dimensional lens spaces L(p; q_1, \ldots, q_n) to be T^{n+1}-equivariantly cobordant to zero. In 2005, B. Hanke showed that complex equivariant cobordism class of a lens space is trivial. Nevertheless, our proofs are constructive using toric topological arguments.
