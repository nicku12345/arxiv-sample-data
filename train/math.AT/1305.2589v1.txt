We study p-localizations, where p is an odd prime, of the full subcategories S^n of stable homotopy category consisting of CW-complexes having cells in n successive dimensions. Using the technique of triangulated categories and matrix problems we classify atoms (indecomposable objects) in S_p^n for n\le 4(p-1) and show that for n>4(p-1) such classification is wild in the sense of the representation theory.
