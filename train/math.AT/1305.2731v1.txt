Greenlees and Sadofsky showed that the classifying spaces of finite groups are self-dual with respect to Morava K-theory K(n). Their duality map was constructed using a transfer map. We generalize their duality map and prove a K(n)-version of Poincare duality for classifying spaces of orbifolds. By regarding these classifying spaces as the homotopy types of certain differentiable stacks, our construction can be viewed as a stack version of Spanier-Whitehead type construction. Some examples and calculations will be given at the end.
