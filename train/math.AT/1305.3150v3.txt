We show that the double cobar construction, \Omega^2 C_*(X), of a simplicial set X is a homotopy BV-algebra if X is a double suspension, or if X is 2-reduced and the coefficient ring contains the ring of rational numbers \mathbb{Q}. Indeed, the Connes-Moscovici operator defines the desired homotopy BV-algebra structure on \Omega^2 C_*(X) when the antipode S : \Omega C_*(X) \to \Omega C_*(X) is involutive. We proceed by defining a family of obstructions O_n : \widetilde{C}_*(X) \to \widetilde{C}_*(X)^{\otimes n}, n\geq 2 measuring the difference S^2 - Id. When X is a suspension, the only obstruction remaining is O_2 := E^{1,1} - \tau E^{1,1} where E^{1,1} is the dual of the \smile_1-product. When X is a double suspension the obstructions vanish.
