In the early 1990's, Lionel Schwartz gave a lovely characterization of the Krull filtration of U, the category of unstable modules over the mod p Steenrod algebra. Soon after, this filtration was used by the author as an organizational tool in posing and studying some topological nonrealization conjectures. In recent years the Krull filtration of U has been similarly used by Castellana, Crespo, and Scherer in their study of H--spaces with finiteness conditions, and Gaudens and Schwartz have given a proof of some of my conjectures. In light of these topological applications, it seems timely to better expose the algebraic properties of the Krull filtration.
