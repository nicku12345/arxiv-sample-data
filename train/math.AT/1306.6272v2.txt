For X a connected finite simplicial complex we consider \Delta^d(X,n) the space of configurations of n ordered points of X such that no d+1 of them are equal, and B^d(X,n) the analogous space of configurations of unordered points. These reduce to the standard configuration spaces of distinct points when d=1. We describe the homotopy groups of \Delta^d(X,n) (resp. B^d(X,n)) in terms of the homotopy (resp. homology) groups of X through a range which is generally sharp. It is noteworthy that the fundamental group of the configuration space B^d(X,n) abelianizes as soon as we allow points to collide (i.e. d\geq 2).
