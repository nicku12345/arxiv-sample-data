In [Pal13] (arXiv:1106.4540) the second author proved that the sequence of "oriented" configuration spaces on an open connected manifold exhibits homological stability as the number of particles goes to infinity. To complement that result we identify the corresponding limiting space, up to homology equivalence, as a certain explicit double cover of a section space. Along the way we also prove that the scanning map of McDuff in [McD75] for unordered configuration spaces is acyclic in the limit.
