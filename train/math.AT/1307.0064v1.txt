We show that there is a non-trivial differential d_4(h_6^3) =h_0^3g_4 in the mod 2 Adams spectral sequence for spheres. This together with the results in \cite{barratt_differentials_1970,lin_differential_1998,kan_differential_2001} completely settle the differentials of h_i^3 for i\ge4. (The differentials of h_i^3 for i=0,1,2,3 are well-known.) Our proof uses the Kevaire invariant elements \theta_i \in\pi_{2^{i+1}-2}^S for i=4,5 with the properties 2\theta_4 =0, 2\theta_5 =0.
