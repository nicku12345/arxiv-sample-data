The sequence 2,5,15,51,187,... with the form (2^n+1)(2^{n-1}+1)/3 has two interpretations in terms of the density of a language with four letters and the cardinality of the quotient of \ZZ_2^n\times \ZZ_2^n under the action of the special linear group \op{SL}(2,\ZZ). The last interpretation follows the rank of the fundamental group of the \ZZ_2^n-cobordism category in dimension 1+1. This article presents how to pass from one side to another between these two approaches.
