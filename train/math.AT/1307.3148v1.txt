We study the homology structure of spaces having an action of the \emph{framed disks} operad. In particular, we compute the relations between Kudo-Araki operations and generalized Batalin-Vilkovisky operators. As an application, we complete the computations of the modulo 2 homology of \Omega^2 S^3 as a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra, and give some evidence for a classical conjecture about the modulo 2 Hurewicz homomorphism of the infinite loop space of the sphere spectrum.
