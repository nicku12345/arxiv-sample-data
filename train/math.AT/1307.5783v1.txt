For a compact Lie group G, we use G-equivariant Poincar\'e duality for ordinary RO(G)-graded homology to define an equivariant intersection product, the dual of the equivariant cup product. Using this, we give a homological construction of the equivariant Lefschetz number and a simple proof of the equivariant Lefschetz fixed point theorem. With similar techniques, an equivariant Fuller index with values in the rationalized Burnside ring is constructed.
