In this paper, we extend earlier work by showing that if X and Y are simplicial complexes (i.e. simplicial sets whose nondegenerate simplices are determined by their vertices), an isomorphism \mathcal{C}(X)\cong\mathcal{C}(Y) of coalgebras over the Barratt-Eccles operad implies that the 3-skeleton of X is weakly equivalent to the 3-skeleton of Y, also implying that \pi_{1}(X)=\pi_{1}(Y).
