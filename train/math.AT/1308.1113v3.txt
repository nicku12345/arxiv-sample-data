Given a Lie group G, one constructs a principal G-bundle on a manifold X by taking a cover U of X, specifying a transition cocycle on the cover, and descending the trivialized bundle along the cover. We demonstrate the existence of an analogous construction for local n-bundles for general n. We establish analogues for simplicial Lie groups of Moore's results on simplicial groups; these imply that bundles for strict Lie n-groups arise from local n-bundles. Our construction leads to simple finite dimensional models of Lie 2-groups such as String(n).
