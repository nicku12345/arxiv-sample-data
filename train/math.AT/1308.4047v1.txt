The structure space S(M) of a closed topological m-manifold M classifies bundles whose fibers are closed m-manifolds equipped with a homotopy equivalence to M. We construct a highly connected map from S(M) to a concoction of algebraic L-theory and algebraic K-theory spaces associated with M. The construction refines the well-known surgery theoretic analysis of the block structure space of M in terms of L-theory.
