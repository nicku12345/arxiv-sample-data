For a simple n-polytope P, a quasitoric manifold over P is a 2n-dimensional smooth manifold with a locally standard action of the n-dimensional torus for which the orbit space is identified with P. This paper shows the topological classification of quasitoric manifolds over the dual cyclic polytope C^n(m)^*, when n>3 or m-n=3. Besides, we classify small covers, the "real version" of quasitoric manifolds, over all dual cyclic polytopes.
