Let M be a connected, closed oriented manifold. Let \omega\in H^m(M) be its orientation class. Let \chi(M) be its Euler characteristic. Consider the free loop fibration \Omega M\buildrel{i}\over\hookrightarrow LM\buildrel{ev}\over\twoheadrightarrow M. For any class a\in H^*(LM) of positive degree, we prove that the cup product \chi(M)a\cup ev^*(\omega) is null. In particular, if i^*:H^*(LM;\mathbb{F}_p)\twoheadrightarrow H^*(\Omega M;\mathbb{F}_p) is onto then \chi(M) is divisible by p (or M is a point).
