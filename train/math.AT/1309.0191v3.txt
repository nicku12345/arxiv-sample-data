This text develops a homotopy theory of 2-categories analogous to Grothendieck's homotopy theory of categories developed in "Pursuing Stacks". We define the notion of "basic localizer of 2-Cat", 2-categorical generalization of Grothendieck's notion of basic localizer, and we show that the homotopy theories of Cat and 2-Cat are equivalent in a remarkably strong sense: there is an isomorphism, compatible with localization, between the ordered classes of basic localizers of Cat and 2-Cat. It follows that weak homotopy equivalences in 2-Cat can be characterised in an internal way, without mentioning topological spaces or simplicial sets.
