The main purpose this work is to study the minimal fixed point set of fiber-preserving maps for spaces which are fiber bundles over the circle and the fiber is the torus. Using the one-parameter fixed point theory is possible to describe these sets in terms of the fundamental group and the induced homomorphism.
