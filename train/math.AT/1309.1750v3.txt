We study homotopy-coherent commutative multiplicative structures on equivariant spaces and spectra. We define N-infinity operads, equivariant generalizations of E-infinity operads. Algebras in equivariant spectra over an N-infinity operad model homotopically commutative equivariant ring spectra that only admit certain collections of Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norms, determined by the operad. Analogously, algebras in equivariant spaces over an N-infinity operad provide explicit constructions of certain transfers. This characterization yields a conceptual explanation of the structure of equivariant infinite loop spaces.   To explain the relationship between norms, transfers, and N-infinity operads, we discuss the general features of these operads, linking their properties to families of finite sets with group actions and analyzing their behavior under norms and geometric fixed points. A surprising consequence of our study is that in stark contract to the classical setting, equivariantly the little disks and linear isometries operads for a general universe U need not determine the same algebras.   Our work is motivated by the need to provide a framework to describe the flavors of commutativity seen in recent work of the second author and Hopkins on localization of equivariant commutative ring spectra.
