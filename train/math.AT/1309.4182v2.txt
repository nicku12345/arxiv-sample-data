A quasitoric manifold is a smooth manifold with a locally standard torus action for which the orbit space is identified with a simple polytope. For a class of topological spaces, the class is called strongly cohomologically rigid if any isomorphism of cohomology rings can be realized as a homeomorphism. This paper shows the strong cohomological rigidity of the class of quasitoric manifolds over I^3.
