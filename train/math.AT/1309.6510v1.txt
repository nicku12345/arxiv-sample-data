It is well-known how to compute the structure of the second homotopy group of a space, X, as a module over the fundamental group, \pi_1X, using the homology of the universal cover and the Hurewicz isomorphism. We describe a new method to compute the third homotopy group, \pi_3 X, as a module over \pi_1 X. Moreover, we determine \pi_3 X as an extension of \pi_1 X-modules derived from Whitehead's Certain Exact Sequence. Our method is based on the theory of quadratic modules. Explicit computations are carried out for pseudo-projective 3-spaces X = S^1 \cup e^2 \cup e^3 consisting of exactly one cell in each dimension \leq 3.
