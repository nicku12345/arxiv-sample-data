For a field \K of characteristic zero, we introduce a cohomologically symplectic poset structure {\mathcal P}_{\K}(X) on a simply connected space X from the viewpoint of \K-homotopy theory. It is given by the poset of inclusions of subgroups preserving c-symplectic structures in the group {\mathcal E}(X_{\K}) of \K-homotopy classes of \K-homotopy self-equivalences of X, which is defined by the \K-Sullivan model of X. We observe that the height of the Hasse diagram of {\mathcal P}_{\K}(X) added by 1, denoted by c-s-{\rm depth}_{\K}(X), is finite and often depends on the field \K. In this paper, we will give some examples of {\mathcal P}_{\K}(X).
