Let X and Y be simply connected CW complexes with finite rational cohomologies. The rational toral rank r_0(X) of a space X is the largest integer r such that the torus T^r can act continuously on a CW-complex in the rational homotopy type of X with all its isotropy subgroups finite \cite{H}. As a rational homotopical condition to be a toral map preserving almost free toral actions for a map f:X\to Y, we define the rational toral rank r_0(f) of f, which is a natural invariant with r_0(id_X)=r_0(X) for the identity map id_X of X. We will see some properties of it by Sullivan models, which is a free commutative differential graded algebra over \Q \cite{FHT}.
