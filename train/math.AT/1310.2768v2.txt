A map f:X\to Y to a simplicial complex Y is called a Y-triangular homotopy equivalence if it has a homotopy inverse g and homotopies h_1:f\circ g\simeq \mathrm{id}_Y, h_2:g\circ f\simeq \mathrm{id}_X such that for all simplices \sigma\in Y, f|_\sigma:f^{-1}(\sigma) \to \sigma is a homotopy equivalence with inverse g|_\sigma:\sigma \to f^{-1}(\sigma) and homotopies h_1|_\sigma and h_2|_\sigma. In this paper we prove that for all pairs X,Y of finite-dimensional locally finite simplicial complexes there is an \epsilon(X,Y)>0 such that any \epsilon-controlled homotopy equivalence f:X\to Y for \epsilon<\epsilon(X,Y) is homotopic to a Y-triangular homotopy equivalence. Conversely, we conjecture that it is possible to `subdivide' a Y-triangular homotopy equivalence by finding a homotopic (Sd\, Y)-triangular homotopy equivalence, consequently a Y-triangular homotopy equivalence would be homotopic to an \epsilon-controlled homotopy equivalence for all \epsilon>0.
