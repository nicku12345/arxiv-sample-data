Let R be a ring spectrum and  E\to X an R-module bundle of rank n. Our main result is to identify the homotopy type of the group-like monoid of homotopy automorphisms of this bundle, hAut^R(E). This will generalize the result regarding R-line bundles previously proven by the authors. The main application is the calculation of the homotopy type of BGL_n(End ((L)) where L \to X is any R-line bundle, and End (L) is the ring spectrum of endomorphisms. In the case when such a bundle is the fiberwise suspension spectrum of a principal bundle over a manifold, G \to P \to M, this leads to a description of the K-theory of the string topology spectrum in terms of the mapping space from M to BGL (\Sigma^\infty (G_+)).
