Let \mathcal{N}_* be the unoriented cobordism algebra, let G=(\Z_2)^n and let Z_*(G) denote the equivariant cobordism algebra of G-manifolds with finite stationary point sets. Let \epsilon_* :Z_*(G) \to \mathcal{N}_* be the homomorphism which forgets the G-action. We use Milnor manifolds (degree 1 hypersurfaces in \R P^m\times \R P^n) to construct non-trivial elements in Z_*(G). We prove that these elements give rise to indecomposable elements in Z_*(G) in degrees up to 2^n - 5. Moreover, in most cases these elements can be arranged to be in \mathit{Ker}(\epsilon_*).
