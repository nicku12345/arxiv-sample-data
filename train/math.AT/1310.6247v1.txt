Let X be a finite type simply connected rationally elliptic CW-complex with Sullivan minimal model (\Lambda V, d) and let k \geq 2 the biggest integer such that d=\sum \limits_{\underset{}{i\geq k}}d_i with d_i(V) \subseteq \Lambda^iV.   In \cite{murillo02} the authors showed that if (\Lambda V,d_k) is morever elliptic then cat(\Lambda V,d)=(k-2)dimV^{even} + dimV^{odd}.   Our work focuses on the estimation of L.S.-category of such spaces in the case when k=3 and when (\Lambda V,d_3) is not necessarily elliptic.
