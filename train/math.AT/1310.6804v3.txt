We study relations among characteristic classes of smooth manifold bundles with highly-connected fibers. For bundles with fiber the connected sum of g copies of a product of spheres S^d \times S^d and an odd d, we find numerous algebraic relations among the so-called "generalized Miller-Morita-Mumford classes". For all g > 1, we show that these infinitely many classes are algebraically generated by a finite subset.   Our results contrast with the fact that there are no algebraic relations among these classes in a range of cohomological degrees that grows linearly with g, according to recent homological stability results. In the case of surface bundles (d=1), our approach recovers some previously known results about the structure of the classical "tautological ring", as introduced by Mumford, using only the tools of algebraic topology.
