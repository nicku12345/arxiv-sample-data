We show how to obtain recollements of triangulated categories using the theory of exact model structures. After noting how the theory relates to well-known notions in the simplest case of Frobenius categories, we apply these ideas to recollements of homotopy categories of chain complexes. In short, we give model categorical explanations for the classical Verdier localization recollement as well as several recollement situations due to Neeman and Murfet.
