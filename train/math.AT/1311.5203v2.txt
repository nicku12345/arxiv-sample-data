By proving that several new complexes of embedded disks are highly connected, we obtain several new homological stability results. Our main result is homological stability for topological chiral homology on an open manifold with coefficients in certain partial framed E_n-algebras. Using this, we prove a special case of a conjecture of Vakil and Wood on homological stability for complements of closures of particular strata in the symmetric powers of an open manifold and we prove that the bounded symmetric powers of closed manifolds satisfy homological stability rationally.
