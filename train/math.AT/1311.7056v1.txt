In this paper, we do the two things.   1. We present a formula to compute the rational cohomology ring of a real topological toric manifold, and thus that of a small cover or a real toric manifold, which implies the formula of Suciu and Trevisan. Furthermore, the formula also works for other coefficient \mathbb{Z}_q = \mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}, where q is a positive odd integer.   2. We construct infinitely many real toric manifolds and small covers whose integral cohomology have a q-torsion for any positive odd integer q.
