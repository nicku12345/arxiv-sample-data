If K is a discrete group and Z is a K-spectrum, then the homotopy fixed point spectrum Z^{hK} is Map_*(EK_+, Z)^K, the fixed points of a familiar expression. Similarly, if G is a profinite group and X is a discrete G-spectrum, then X^{hG} is often given by (H_{G,X})^G, where H_{G,X} is a certain explicit construction given by a homotopy limit in the category of discrete G-spectra. Thus, in each of two common equivariant settings, the homotopy fixed point spectrum is equal to the fixed points of an explicit object in the ambient equivariant category. We enrich this pattern by proving in a precise sense that the discrete G-spectrum H_{G,X} is just "a profinite version" of Map_*(EK_+, Z): at each stage of its construction, H_{G,X} replicates in the setting of discrete G-spectra the corresponding stage in the formation of Map_*(EK_+, Z) (up to a certain natural identification).
