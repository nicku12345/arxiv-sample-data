With G = \mathbb{Z}/2, we calculate the ordinary G-cohomology (with Burnside ring coefficients) of \mathbb{C}P_G^\infty = B_GU(1), the complex projective space, a model for the classifying space for G-equivariant complex line bundles. The RO(G)-graded ordinary cohomology was calculated by Gaunce Lewis, but here we extend to a larger grading in order to capture a more natural set of generators, including the Euler class of the canonical bundle.
