This paper shows that \mathrm{tmf}[1/6] is not a ring spectrum quotient of \mathrm{MO}\langle8\rangle[1/6]. In fact, for any prime p>3 and any sequence X of homogeneous elements of \pi_*\mathrm{MO}\langle8\rangle, the \pi_*\mathrm{MO}\langle8\rangle-module \pi_*\big(\mathrm{MO}\langle8\rangle_{(p)}/X\big) is not (even abstractly) isomorphic to \pi_*\mathrm{tmf}_{(p)}.   It does so by showing that, for any commutative ring spectrum R and any sequence X of homogeneous elements of \pi_*(R), there is an isomorphism of graded \mathbf{Q}-vector spaces \pi_*(R/X)\otimes\mathbf{Q} \cong \mathrm{H}_*(\mathrm{Tot}(\mathrm{K}(X)))\otimes\mathbf{Q}, where the right-hand side is the rational homology of the (total) Koszul complex of X, which is strictly bigger than \pi_*(R)/(X)\otimes\mathbf{Q} unless X is a \pi_*(R)\otimes\mathbf{Q}-quasi-regular sequence. The result then follows from the fact that the kernel of the p-local Witten genus cannot be generated by a \pi_*\mathrm{MO}\langle8\rangle\otimes\mathbf{Q}-quasi-regular sequence.
