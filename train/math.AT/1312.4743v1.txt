Let k,l,m,n be positive integers such that m-l\ge l>k, m-l>n-k\ge k and m-l>2k^2-k-1. Let G_{k}(\mathbb{C}^n) denote the Grassmann manifold of k-dimensional vector subspaces of \bc^n. We show that any continuous map f:G_{l}(\bc^m)\to G_{k}(\mathbb{C}^n) is rationally null-homotopic. As an application, we show the existence of a point A\in G_{l}(\bc^m) such that the vector space f(A) is contained in A; here \mathbb{C}^n is regarded as a vector subspace of \mathbb{C}^m\cong \bc^n\oplus\bc^{m-n}.
