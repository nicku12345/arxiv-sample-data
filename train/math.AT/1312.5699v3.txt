Given a commutative ring spectrum R let \Lambda_XR be the Loday functor constructed by Brun, Carlson and Dundas. Given a prime p\geq 5 we calculate \pi_*(\Lambda_{S^n}H\mathbb{F}_p) and \pi_*(\Lambda_{T^n}H\mathbb{F}_p) for n\leq p, and use these results to deduce that v_{n-1} in the n-1-th connective Morava K-theory of (\Lambda_{T^{n}}H\mathbb{F}_p)^{hT^{n}} is non-zero and detected in the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence by an explicit element, which class we name the Rognes class.   To facilitate these calculations we introduce Multifold Hopf algebras. Each axis circle in T^n gives rise to a Hopf algebra structure on \pi_*(\Lambda_{T^n}H\mathbb{F}_p), and the way these Hopf Algebra structures interact is encoded with a Multifold Hopf algebra structure. This structure puts several restrictions on the possible algrebra structures on \pi_*(\Lambda_{T^n}H\mathbb{F}_p) and is a vital tool in the calculations above.
