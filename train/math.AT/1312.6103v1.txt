From a bimodule M over an exact category C, we define an exact category C\ltimes M with a projection down to C. This construction classifies certain split square zero extensions of exact categories. We show that the trace map induces an equivalence between the relative K-theory of C\ltimes M and its relative topological cyclic homology. When applied to the bimodule \hom(-,-\otimes_AM) on the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring A one recovers the classical Dundas-McCarthy theorem for split square zero extensions of rings.
