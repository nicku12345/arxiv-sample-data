We extend Torleif Veen's calculation of higher topological Hochschild homology {\sf THH}^{[n]}_*(\mathbb{F}_p) from n\leq 2p to n\leq 2p+2 for p odd, and from n=2 to n\leq 3 for p=2. We calculate higher Hochschild homology {\sf HH}_*^{[n]}(k[x]) over k for any integral domain k, and {\sf HH}_*^{[n]}(\mathbb{F}_p[x]/x^{p^\ell}) for all n>0. We use this and \'etale descent to calculate {\sf HH}_*^{[n]}(\mathbb{F}_p[G]) for all n>0 for any cyclic group G, and therefore also for any finitely generated abelian group G. We show a splitting result for higher {\sf THH} of commutative \mathbb{F}_p-group algebras and use this technique to calculate higher topological Hochschild homology of such group algebras for as large an n as {\sf THH}^{[n]}_*(\mathbb{F}_p)  is known for.
