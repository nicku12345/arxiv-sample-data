A Bott manifold is the total space of some iterated \mathbb C P^1-bundle over a point. We prove that any graded ring isomorphism between the cohomology rings of two Bott manifolds preserves their Pontrjagin classes. Moreover, we prove that such an isomorphism is induced from a diffeomorphism if the Bott manifolds are \mathbb Z/2-trivial, where a Bott manifold is called \mathbb Z/2-trivial if its cohomology ring with \mathbb Z/2-coefficient is isomorphic to that of a product of \mathbb C P^1's.
