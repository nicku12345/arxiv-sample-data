The quotient cohomology of tiling spaces is a topological invariant that relates a tiling space to one of its factors, viewed as topological dynamical systems. In particular, it is a relative version of the tiling cohomology that distinguishes factors of tiling spaces. In this work, the quotient cohomologies within certain families of substitution tiling spaces in 1 and 2 dimensions are determined. Specifically, the quotient cohomologies for the family of the generalised Thue-Morse sequences and generalised chair tilings are presented.
