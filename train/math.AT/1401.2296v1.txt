Let f:T^2\to\mathbb{R} be a Morse function on a 2-torus, \mathcal{S}(f) and \mathcal{O}(f) be its stabilizer and orbit with respect to the right action of the group \mathcal{D}(T^2) of diffeomorphisms of T^2, \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{id}}(T^2) be the identity path component of \mathcal{D}(T^2), and \mathcal{S}'(f) = \mathcal{S}(f) \cap \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{id}}(T^2). We give sufficient conditions under which  \pi_1\mathcal{O}_f(f) \ \cong \ \pi_1\mathcal{D}(T^2) \times \pi_0 \mathcal{S}'(f) \ \equiv \ \mathbb{Z}^2 \times \pi_0 \mathcal{S}'(f). In fact this result holds for a larger class of smooth functions f:T^2\to\mathbb{R} having the following property: for every critical point z of f the germ of f at z is smothly equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial \mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} without multiple factors.
