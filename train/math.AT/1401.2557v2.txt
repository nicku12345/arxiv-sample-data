In this paper, using the topology on the set of shape morphisms between arbitrary topological spaces X, Y, Sh(X,Y), defined by Cuchillo-Ibanez et al. in 1999, we consider a topology on the shape homotopy groups of arbitrary topological spaces which make them Hausdorff topological groups. We then exhibit an example in which \check{\pi}_k^{top} succeeds in distinguishing the shape type of X and Y while \check{\pi}_k fails, for all k\in \Bbb{N}. Moreover, we present some basic properties of topological shape homotopy groups, among them commutativity of \check{\pi}_k^{top} with finite product of compact Hausdorff spaces. Finally, we consider a quotient topology on the kth shape group induced by the kth shape loop space and show that it coincides with the above topology.
