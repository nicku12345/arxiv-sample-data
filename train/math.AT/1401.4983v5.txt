This document contains large-format Adams charts that compute 2-complete stable homotopy groups, both in the classical context and in the motivic context over C. The charts are essentially complete through the 61-stem and contain partial results to the 70-stem. In the classical context, we believe that these are the most accurate charts of their kind.   We also include Adams charts for the motivic homotopy groups of the cofiber of tau.
