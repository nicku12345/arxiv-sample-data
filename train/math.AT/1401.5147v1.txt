Motivated by a result from string topology, we prove a duality in topological Hochschild homology (THH). The duality relates the THH of an E_1-algebra spectrum and the THH of its derived Koszul dual algebra under certain compactness conditions. The result relies on results about module categories which may be of interest on their own. Finally, we relate this result to topological field theories and outline some future work.
