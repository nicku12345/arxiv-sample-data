For a profinite group G, let (\text{-})^{hG}, (\text{-})^{h_dG}, and (\text{-})^{h'G} denote continuous homotopy fixed points for profinite G-spectra, discrete G-spectra, and continuous G-spectra (coming from towers of discrete G-spectra), respectively. We establish some connections between the first two notions, and by using Postnikov towers, for K \vartriangleleft_c G (a closed normal subgroup), give various conditions for when the iterated homotopy fixed points (X^{hK})^{hG/K} exist and are X^{hG}. For the Lubin-Tate spectrum E_n and G <_c G_n, the extended Morava stabilizer group, our results show that E_n^{hK} is a profinite G/K-spectrum with (E_n^{hK})^{hG/K} \simeq E_n^{hG}, by an argument that possesses a certain technical simplicity not enjoyed by either the proof that (E_n^{h'K})^{h'G/K} \simeq E_n^{h'G} or the Devinatz-Hopkins proof (which requires |G/K| < \infty) of (E_n^{dhK})^{h_dG/K} \simeq E_n^{dhG}, where E_n^{dhK} is a construction that behaves like continuous homotopy fixed points. Also, we prove that (in general) the G/K-homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for \pi_\ast((E_n^{hK})^{hG/K}), with E_2^{s,t} = H^s_c(G/K; \pi_t(E_n^{hK})) (continuous cohomology), is isomorphic to both the strongly convergent Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence of Devinatz for \pi_\ast(E_n^{dhG}), with E_2^{s,t} = H^s_c(G/K; \pi_t(E_n^{dhK})), and the descent spectral sequence for \pi_\ast((E_n^{h'K})^{h'G/K}).
