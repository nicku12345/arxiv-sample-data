The sphere S^2 and the torus T^2 are the only closed connected surfaces for which higher topological complexities are known (for each n\in\{2,3,...\}\subset\mathbb{N}, \mathrm{TC}_n(S^2)=n and \mathrm{TC}_n(T^2)=2n-2). This text aims to find topological complexities for most other closed connected surfaces. For all but S^2, T^2, the projective plane (\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2) and the Klein bottle the n-th topological complexity is 2n.
