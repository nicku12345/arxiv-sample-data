Let G be a group acting freely, properly discontinuously and cellularly on a finite dimensional CW-complex \Sigma(2n) which has the homotopy type of the 2n- sphere \mathbb{S}^{2n}. Then, this action induces an action of the group G on the top cohomology of \Sigma(2n). For the family of virtually cyclic groups, we classify all groups which act on \Sigma(2n), the homotopy type of all possible orbit spaces and all actions on the top cohomology as well. \par Under the hypothesis that \mbox{dim}\,\Sigma(2n)\leq 2n+1, we study the groups with the virtual cohomological dimension \mbox{vcd}\,G<\infty which act as above on \Sigma(2n). It turns out that they consist of free groups and certain semi-direct products F\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2 with F a free group. For those groups G and a given action of G on \mbox{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}), we present an algebraic criterion equivalent to the realizability of an action G on \Sigma(2n) which induces the given action on its top cohomology. Then, we obtain a classification of those groups together with actions on the top cohomology of \Sigma(2n).
