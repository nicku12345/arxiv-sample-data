In this paper, we extend earlier work by showing that if X and Y are simplicial complexes (i.e. simplicial sets whose simplices are determined by their vertices), a morphism g:N(X)\to N(Y) of Steenrod coalgebras (normalized chain-complexes equipped with extra structure) induces one of their topological realizations \hat{g}:|X|\to |Y|. If g is an isomorphism, then it induces an isomorphism between X and Y, implying that they are homeomorphic.
