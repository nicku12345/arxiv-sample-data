In this paper we prove that \beta_{p^2/p^2-1} survives to E_\infty in the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for p\geqslant 5. As an easy consequence we prove that \beta_{sp^2/j} are perminent cycles for all s\geqslant 1, j\leqslant p^2-1. From the Thom map \Phi: Ext^{s,t}_{BP_*BP}(BP_*, BP_*)\longrightarrow Ext^{s,t}_A(\mathbb{Z}/p, \mathbb{Z}/p), we also see that h_0h_3 survives to E_\infty in the classical Adams spectral sequence.
