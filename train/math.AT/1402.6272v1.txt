We study a special type of E_\infty-operads that govern strictly unital E_\infty-coalgebras (and algebras) over the ring of integers. Morphisms of coalgebras over such an operad are defined by using universal E_\infty-bimodules. Thus we obtain a category of E_\infty-coalgebras. It turns out that if the homology of an E_\infty-coalgebra have no torsion, then there is a natural way to define an E_\infty-coalgebra structure on the homology so that the resulting coalgebra be isomorphic to the initial E_\infty-coalgebra in our category. We also discuss some invariants of the E_\infty-coalgebra structure on homology and relate them to the invariant formerly used by the author to distinguish the fundamental groups of the complements of combinatorially equivalent complex hyperplane arrangements.
