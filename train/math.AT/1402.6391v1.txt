We define the notion of valuation on simplicial maps between geometric realizations of simplicial complexes in \mathbb{R}^n. Valuations on simplicial maps are analogous to valuations on sets. In particular, we define the Lefschetz volumes, which are analogous to the intrinsic volumes of subsets of \mathbb{R}^n. Our definition not only provides a generalization of the Lefschetz number, but also yields a Hadwiger-style classification theorem for all such valuations.
