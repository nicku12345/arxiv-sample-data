In this paper, we determine the connective K-cohomology with reality of elementary abelian 2-groups as a module over \mathbb{Z}[v_1,a], where v_1 is the equivariant Bott class and a the Euler class of the sign representation. This gives in particular a new approach to the computation of the connective real K-theory of such groups. The originality here is to make all computations in the \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant stable category, considering only \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant cohomology theories, and to use relative homological algebra over certain subalgebras of the equivariant Steenrod algebra to perform explicit computations.
