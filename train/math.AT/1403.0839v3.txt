This paper contains two results on how homotopy limits of topological spaces interact with connectivity. The first is a formula for the connectivity of the homotopy limit of diagrams shaped over suitably finite categories, in terms of the connectivity of the spaces in the diagram. The second result shows that the homotopy fiber of the restriction map induced on homotopy limits by a functor of indexing categories is itself a homotopy limit, indexed over a Grothendieck construction.
