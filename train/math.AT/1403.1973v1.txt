In this note, we extend earlier work by showing that if X and Y are delta-complexes (i.e. simplicial sets without degeneracy operators), a morphism g:N(X)\to N(Y) of Steenrod coalgebras (normalized chain-complexes equipped with extra structure) induces one of 2-skeleta \hat{g}:X_{2}\to Y_{2}, inducing a homomorphism \pi_{1}(\hat{g}):\pi_{1}(X)\to\pi_{1}(Y) that is an isomorphism if g is an isomorphism. This implies a corresponding conclusion for a morphism g:C(X)\to C(Y) of Steenrod coalgebras on unnormalized chain-complexes of simplicial sets.
