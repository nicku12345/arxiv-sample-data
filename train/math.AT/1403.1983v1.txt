In this article we study the bordism groups of normally nonsingular maps f: X \to Y defined on pseudomanifolds X and Y. To characterize the bordism of such maps, inspired by the formula given by Stong, we give a general definition of Stiefel-Whitney numbers defined on X and Y using the Wu classes defined by Goresky and Pardon and we show that in several cases the cobordism class of a normally nonsingular map f:X \to Y guarantees that these numbers are zero.
