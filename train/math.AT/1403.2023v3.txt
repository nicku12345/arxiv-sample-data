We prove a conjecture of J.P. May concerning the nilpotence of elements in ring spectra with power operations, i.e., H_\infty-ring spectra. Using an explicit nilpotence bound on the torsion elements in K(n)-local H_\infty-algebras over E_n, we reduce the conjecture to the nilpotence theorem of Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith. As corollaries we obtain nilpotence results in various bordism rings including M\mathit{Spin}_* and M\mathit{String}_*, results about the behavior of the Adams spectral sequence for E_\infty-ring spectra, and the non-existence of E_\infty-ring structures on certain complex oriented ring spectra.
