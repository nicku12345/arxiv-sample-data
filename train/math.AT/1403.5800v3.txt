Let H be an arrangement of real hyperplanes in R^n. The complexification of H defines a natural stratification of C^n. We denote by Perv(C^n, H) the category of perverse sheaves on C^n smooth with respect to this stratification. We give a description of Perv(C^n, H) as the category of representations of an explicit quiver with relations, whose vertices correspond to real faces of H (of all dimensions). The relations are of monomial nature: they identify some pairs of paths in the quiver. They can be formulated in terms of the oriented matroid associated to H.
