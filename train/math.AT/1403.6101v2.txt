Let G be a finite group acting on a small category I. We study functors X \colon I \to \mathscr{C} equipped with families of compatible natural transformations that give a kind of generalized G-action on X. Such objects are called G-diagrams. When \mathscr{C} is a sufficiently nice model category we define a model structure on the category of G-diagrams in \mathscr{C}. There are natural G-actions on Bousfield-Kan style homotopy limits and colimits of G-diagrams. We prove that weak equivalences between point-wise (co)fibrant G-diagrams induce weak G-equivalences on homotopy (co)limits. A case of particular interest is when the indexing category is a cube. We use homotopy limits and colimits over such diagrams to produce loop and suspension spaces with respect to permutation representations of G. We go on to develop a theory of enriched equivariant homotopy functors and give an equivariant "linearity" condition in terms of cubical G-diagrams. In the case of G-topological spaces we prove that this condition is equivalent to Blumberg's notion of G-linearity. In particular we show that the Wirthm\"{u}ller isomorphism theorem is a direct consequence of the equivariant linearity of the identity functor on G-spectra.
