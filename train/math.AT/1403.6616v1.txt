It is well known that cohomology with compact supports is not a homotopy invariant but only a proper homotopy one. However, as the proper category lacks of general categorical properties, a Brown representability theorem type does not seem reachable. However, by proving such a theorem for the so called exterior cohomology in the complete and cocomplete exterior category, we show that the n-th cohomology with compact supports of a given countable, locally finite, finite dimensional relative CW-complex (X,\mathbb{R}_+) is naturally identified with the set [X,K_n]^{\mathbb{R}_+} of exterior based homotopy classes from a "classifying space" K_n. We also show that this space has the exterior homotopy type of the exterior Eilenberg-MacLane space for Brown-Grossman homotopy groups of type (R^\infty,n), R being the fixed coefficient ring.
