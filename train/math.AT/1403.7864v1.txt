Given a space X and a simplicial complex K with m-vertices, the arrangement of partially diagonal subspaces of X^m, called the dragonal arrangement, is defined. We decompose the suspension of the diagonal arrangement when 2(dim K + 1) < m, which generalizes the result of Labassi. As a corollary, we calculate the Euler characteristic of the complement when X is a closed connected manifold.
