Let X be a locally 1-connected metric space and A_1,A_2,...,A_n be connected, locally path connected and compact pairwise disjoint subspaces of X. In this paper, we show that the quotient space X/(A_1,A_2,...,A_n) obtained from X by collapsing each of the sets A_i's to a point, is also locally 1-connected. Moreover, we prove that the induced continuous homomorphism of quasitopological fundamental groups is surjective. Finally, we give some applications to find out some properties of the fundamental group of the quotient space X/(A_1,A_2,...,A_n).
