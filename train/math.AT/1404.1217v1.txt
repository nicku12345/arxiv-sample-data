The Springer variety of type A associated to a nilpotent operator on \mathbb{C}^n in Jordan canonical form admits a natural action of the \ell-dimensional torus T^{\ell} where \ell is the number of the Jordan blocks. We give a presentation of the T^{\ell}-equivariant cohomology ring of the Springer variety through an explicit construction of an action of the n-th symmetric group on the T^{\ell}-equivariant cohomology group. The T^{\ell}-equivariant analogue of so called Tanisaki's ideal will appear in the presentation.
