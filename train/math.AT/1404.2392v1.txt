Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, S finite, and let G_{W} be the associated Artin group. One has configuration spaces Y,\ Y_{W}, where G_{W}=\pi_1(Y_{W}), and a natural W-covering f_{W}:\ Y\to Y_{W}. The Schwarz genus g(f_{W}) is a natural topological invariant to consider. In this paper we generalize this result by computing the Schwarz genus for a class of Artin groups, which includes the affine-type Artin groups. Let K=K(W,S) be the simplicial scheme of all subsets J\subset S such that the parabolic group  W_J  is finite. We introduce the class of groups for which dim(K) equals the homological dimension of K, and we show that g(f_{W}) is always the maximum possible for such class of groups. For affine Artin groups, such maximum reduces to the rank of the group. In general, it is given by dim(X_{W})+1, where  X_{ W}\subset Y_{ W} is a well-known CW-complex which has the same homotopy type as  Y_{ W}.
