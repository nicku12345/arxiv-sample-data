We give conditions on a monoidal model category M and on a set of maps C so that the Bousfield localization of M with respect to C preserves the structure of algebras over various operads. This problem was motivated by an example that demonstrates that, for the model category of equivariant spectra, preservation does not come for free, even for cofibrant operads. We discuss this example in detail and provide a general theorem regarding when localization preserves P-algebra structure for an arbitrary operad P.   We characterize the localizations that respect monoidal structure and prove that all such localizations preserve algebras over cofibrant operads. As a special case we recover numerous classical theorems about preservation of algebraic structure under localization, in the context of spaces, spectra, chain complexes, and equivariant spectra. We also provide several new results in these settings, and we sharpen a recent result of Hill and Hopkins regarding preservation for equivariant spectra. To demonstrate our preservation result for non-cofibrant operads, we work out when localization preserves commutative monoids and the commutative monoid axiom, and again numerous examples are provided. Finally, we provide conditions so that localization preserves the monoid axiom.
