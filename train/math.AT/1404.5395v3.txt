An IP-space is a pseudomanifold whose defining local properties imply that its middle perversity global intersection homology groups satisfy Poincar\'e duality integrally. We show that the symmetric signature induces a map of Quinn spectra from IP bordism to the symmetric L-spectrum of \Z, which is, up to weak equivalence, an E_\infty ring map. Using this map, we construct a fundamental L-homology class for IP-spaces, and as a consequence we prove the stratified Novikov conjecture for IP-spaces.
