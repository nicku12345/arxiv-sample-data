The aim of this paper is to study sub-algebras of the \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant Steenrod algebra (for cohomology with coefficients in the constant Mackey functor \mathbb{F}_2) which come from quotient Hopf algebroids of the \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant dual Steenrod algebra. In particular, we study the equivariant counterpart of profile functions, exhibit the equivariant analogues of the classical \mathcal{A}(n) and \mathcal{E}(n) and show that the Steenrod algebra is free as a module over these.
