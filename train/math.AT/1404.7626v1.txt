The aim of this note is to provide a comprehensive treatment of the homotopy theory of \Gamma-G-spaces for G a finite group. We introduce two level and stable model structures on \Gamma-G-spaces and exhibit Quillen adjunctions to G-symmetric spectra with respect to a flat level and a stable flat model structure respectively. Then we give a proof that \Gamma-G-spaces model connective equivariant stable homotopy theory along the lines of the proof in the non-equivariant setting given by Bousfield and Friedlander. Furthermore, we study the smash product of \Gamma-G-spaces and show that the functor from \Gamma-G-spaces to G-symmetric spectra commutes with the derived smash product. Finally, we show that there is a good notion of geometric fixed points for \Gamma-G-spaces.
