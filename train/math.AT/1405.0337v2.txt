A Lie group is called p-regular if it has the p-local homotopy type of a product of spheres. (Non)triviality of the Samelson products of the inclusions of the factor spheres into p-regular \mathrm{SO}(2n)_{(p)} is determined, which completes the list of (non)triviality of such Samelson products in p-regular simple Lie groups. As an application, we determine the homotopy normality of the inclusion \mathrm{SO}(2n-1)\to\mathrm{SO}(2n) in the sense of James at any prime p.
