Let X and Y be spaces and M be an abelian group. A homotopy invariant f\colon [X,Y]\to M is called straight if there exists a homomorphism F\colon L(X,Y)\to M such that f([a])=F(\langle a\rangle) for all a\in C(X,Y). Here \langle a\rangle\colon\langle X\rangle\to\langle Y\rangle is the homomorphism induced by a between the abelian groups freely generated by X and Y and L(X,Y) is a certain group of `admissible' homomorphisms. We show that all straight invariants can be expressed through a `universal' straight invariant of homological nature.
