The purpose of this paper is to study the topology of certain toric varieties X_I, arising as quotients of the action of \C^* on complements of arrangements of coordinate subspaces in \C^n, and to improve the homotopy stability dimension for the inclusion map i_d:\Hol_d^*(S^2,X_I)\to \Map_d^*(S^2,X_I) given in \cite{GKY1} by using spectral sequences induced from simplicial resolutions.
