Let f:\CN \rightarrow \C  be a polynomial, which is transversal (or regular) at infinity. Let \U=\CN\setminus f^{-1}(0) be the corresponding affine hypersurface complement. By using the peripheral complex associated to f, we give several estimates for the (infinite cyclic) Alexander polynomials of \U induced by f, and we describe the error terms for such estimates. The obtained polynomial identities can be further refined by using the Reidemeister torsion, generalizing a similar formula proved by Cogolludo and Florens in the case of plane curves. We also show that the above-mentioned peripheral complex underlies an algebraic mixed Hodge module. This fact allows us to construct mixed Hodge structures on the Alexander modules of the boundary manifold of \U.
