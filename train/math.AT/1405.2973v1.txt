We generalise the notion of subdivision of a finite-dimensional locally finite simplicial complex X to geometric algebra, namely to the simplicially controlled categories \mathbb{A}^*(X), \mathbb{A}_*(X) of Ranicki and Weiss. We prove a squeezing result: a bounded chain equivalence of sufficiently algebraically subdivided chain complexes can be squeezed to a simplicially controlled chain equivalence of the unsubdivided chain complexes. Giving X\times\mathbb{R} a bounded triangulation measured in the open cone O(X_+) we use algebraic subdivision to define a functor \mathrm{"}-\otimes\mathbb{Z}\mathrm{"}:\mathbb{B}(\mathbb{A}(X))\to \mathbb{B}(\mathbb{A}(X\times\mathbb{R})) that corresponds to tensoring with the simplicial chain complex of \mathbb{Z} and algebraically subdividing to be bounded over O(X_+). We show that C\simeq 0 \in \mathbb{B}(\mathbb{A}(X)) if and only if \mathrm{"}C\otimes\mathbb{Z}\mathrm{"} is boundedly chain contractible over O(X_+). These results have applications to Poincar\'e duality and homology manifold detection as a finite-dimensional locally finite simplicial complex X is a homology manifold if and only if it has X-controlled Poincar\'e duality. We prove a Poincar\'e duality squeezing theorem that such a space X with sufficiently controlled Poincar\'e duality must have X-controlled Poincar\'e duality and we prove a Poincar\'e duality splitting theorem with the consequence that X is a homology manifold if and only if X\times\mathbb{R} has bounded Poincar\'e duality over O(X_+).
