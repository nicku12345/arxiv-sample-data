Using factorization homology, we realize the rational homology of the unordered configuration spaces of an arbitrary manifold M, possibly with boundary, as the homology of a Lie algebra constructed from the compactly supported cohomology of M. By locating the homology of each configuration space within the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of this Lie algebra, we extend theorems of B\"odigheimer-Cohen-Taylor and F\'elix-Thomas and give a new, combinatorial proof of the homological stability results of Church and Randal-Williams. Our method lends itself to explicit calculations, examples of which we include.
