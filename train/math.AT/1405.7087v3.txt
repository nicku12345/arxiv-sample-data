We define bounded generation for E_n-algebras in chain complexes and prove that for n \geq 2 this property is equivalent to homological stability. Using this we prove a local-to-global principle for homological stability, which says that if an E_n-algebra A has homological stability (or equivalently the topological chiral homology \int_{R^n} A has homology stability), then so has the topological chiral homology \int_M A of any connected non-compact manifold M. Using scanning, we reformulate the local-to-global homological stability principle in a way that also applies to compact manifolds. We also give several applications of our results
