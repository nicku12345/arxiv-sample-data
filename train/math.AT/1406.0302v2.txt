Deletion-restriction is a fundamental tool in the theory of hyperplane arrangements. Various important results in this field have been proved using deletion-restriction. In this paper we use deletion-restriction to identify a class of toric arrangements for which the cohomology algebra of the complement is generated in degree 1. We also show that for these arrangements the complement is formal in the sense of Sullivan.
