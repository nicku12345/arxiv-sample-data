In this paper we give a simple proof of the equivalence between the rational link associated to the continued fraction \left[ a_{1},a_{2},\cdots a_{m}\right], a_{i}\in\mathbb{N}, and the two bridge link of type p/q, where p/q is the rational given by \left[ a_{1}%,a_{2},\cdots a_{m}\right] . The known proof of this equivalence relies on the two fold cover of a link and the classification of the lens spaces. Our proof is elementary and combinatorial and follows the naive approach of finding a set of movements to transform the rational link given by \left[ a_{1},a_{2},\cdots a_{m}\right]  into the two bridge link of type p/q.
