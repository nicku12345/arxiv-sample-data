Ravenel proved the remarkable fact that the K-theoretic localization L_K S^0 of the sphere spectrum has \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} as homotopy group in dimension -2. Mike Hopkins' chromatic splitting conjecture implies more generally that there are 3^{n-1} copies of (\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})_p in the homotopy groups of the E(n)-localization of S^0; but where these copies occur can be confusing. We try here to simplify this book-keeping.
