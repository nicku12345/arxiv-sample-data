We describe a "cellular" approach to the computation of the cohomology of a poset with coefficients in a presheaf. A cellular cochain complex is constructed, described explicitly and shown to compute the cohomology under certain circumstances. The descriptions are refined further for certain classes of posets including the cell posets of regular CW-complexes and geometric lattices.
