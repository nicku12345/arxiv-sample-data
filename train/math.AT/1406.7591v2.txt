This paper investigates the moment-angle manifolds whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to that of a connected sum of sphere products. We first give a example of moment-angle manifolds corresponding to a 4 dimentional simplicial polytope. It has the property that its cohomology ring is isomorphic to that of a connected sum of sphere products with one produt of thress spheres. Finally, we give some general properties of this kind of moment-angle manifolds.
