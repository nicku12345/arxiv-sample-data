We introduce a family of twisted K(n)-local theories that behave analogous to twisted K-theory. Let R_n= E_n^{hS\mathbb G_n}, the homotopy fixed point spectrum under the action of the subgroup S\mathbb G_n of the Morava stabilizer group where S\mathbb G_n is the kernel of the determinant homomorphism \text{det}:\mathbb G_n\to \mathbb Z_p^\times. We show that for a K(n)-local space X with a L_{K(n)}K(\mathbb Z_p, n+1)-bundle P\to X, the P-twisted R_n-theory of X is defined. We show that analogous to twisted K-theory, a universal coefficient type isomorphism holds for these theories.
