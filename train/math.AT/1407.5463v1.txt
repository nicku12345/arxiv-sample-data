Let G be a compact connected Lie group, or more generally a path connected topological group of the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex, and let X be a rational nilpotent G-space. In this paper we analyze the homotopy type of the homotopy fixed point set X^{hG}, and the natural injection k\colon X^G\hookrightarrow X^{hG}. We show that if X is elliptic, that is, it has finite dimensional rational homotopy and cohomology, then each path component of X^{hG} is also elliptic. We also give an explicit algebraic model of the inclusion k based on which we can prove, for instance, that for G a torus, \pi_*(k) is injective in rational homotopy but, often, far from being a rational homotopy equivalence.
