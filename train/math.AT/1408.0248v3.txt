This document contains large-format Adams-Novikov charts that compute the classical 2-complete stable homotopy groups. The charts are essentially complete through the 60-stem. We believe that these are the most accurate and extensive charts of their kind. We also include a motivic Adams-Novikov E-infinity chart.
