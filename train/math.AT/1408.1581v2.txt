We show that the \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant Morava K-theories with reality (as defined by Hu) are self-dual with respect to equivariant Anderson duality. In particular, there is a universal coefficients exact sequence in Morava K-theory with reality. As a particular example, we recover the self-duality of the spectrum KO. The study of \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant Anderson duality made in this paper gives a nice interpretation of some symmetries of RO(\mathbb{Z}/2)-graded (i.e. bigraded) equivariant cohomology groups in terms of Mackey functor duality.
