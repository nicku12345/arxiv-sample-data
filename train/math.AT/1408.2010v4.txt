We denote the n-th projective space of a topological monoid G by B_nG and the classifying space by BG. Let G be a well-pointed topological monoid of the homotopy type of a CW complex and G' a well-pointed grouplike topological monoid. We prove the weak equivalence between the pointed mapping space \mathrm{Map}_0(B_nG,BG) and the space of all A_n-maps from G to G'. This fact has several applications. As the first application, we show that the connecting map G\rightarrow\mathrm{Map}_0(B_nG,BG) of the evaluation fiber sequence \mathrm{Map}_0(B_nG,BG)\rightarrow\mathrm{Map}(B_nG,BG)\rightarrow BG is delooped. As other applications, we consider higher homotopy commutativity, A_n-types of gauge groups, T_k^f-spaces by Iwase--Mimura--Oda--Yoon and homotopy pullback of A_n-maps. In particular, we show that the T_k^f-space and the C_k^f-space are exactly the same concept and give some new examples of T_k^f-spaces.
