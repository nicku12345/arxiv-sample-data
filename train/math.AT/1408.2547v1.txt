Let J(X) denote the James construction on a space X and J_n(X) be the n-th stage of the James filtration of J(X). It is known that [J(X),\Omega Y]\cong \lim\limits_{\leftarrow} [J_n(X),\Omega Y] for any space Y. When X=\mathbb S^1, the circle, J(\mathbb S^1)=\Omega \Sigma \mathbb S^1=\Omega \mathbb S^2. Furthermore, there is a bijection between [J(\mathbb S^1),\Omega Y] and the product \prod_{i=2}^\infty \pi_i(Y), as sets. In this paper, we describe the group structure of [J_n(\mathbb S^1),\Omega Y] by determining the co-multiplication structure on the suspension \Sigma J_n(\mathbb S^1).
