We give an explicit (new) morphism of modules between H^*_T(G/P) \otimes H^*_T(P/B) and H^*_T(G/B) and prove (the known result) that the two modules are isomorphic. Our map identifies submodules of the cohomology of the flag variety that are isomorphic to each of H^*_T(G/P) and H^*_T(P/B). With this identification, the map is simply the product within the ring H^*_T(G/B). We use this map in two ways. First we describe module bases for H^*_T(G/B) that are different from traditional Schubert classes and from each other. Second we analyze a W-representation on H^*_T(G/B) via restriction to subgroups W_P. In particular we show that the character of the Springer representation on H^*_T(G/B) is a multiple of the restricted representation of W_P on H^*_T(P/B).
