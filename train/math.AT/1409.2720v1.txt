We restrict geometric tangential equivariant complex T^n-bordism to torus manifolds and provide a complete combinatorial description of the appropriate non-commutative ring. We discover, using equivariant K-theory characteristic numbers, that the information encoded in the oriented torus graph associated to a stably complex torus manifold completely describes its equivariant bordism class. We also consider the role of omnioriented quasitoric manifolds in this description.
