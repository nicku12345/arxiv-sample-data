The purpose of this note is to clarify some details in McDuff and Segal's proof of the group-completion theorem and to generalize both this and the homology fibration criterion of McDuff to homology with twisted coefficients. This will be used in forthcoming work to identify the limiting homology of "oriented" configuration spaces, which doubly cover the classical configuration spaces of distinct unordered points in a manifold.
