Building on results of M. Ando, M.J. Hopkins and C. Rezk, we show the existence of uncountably many \mathbb{E}_\infty-String orientations of real K-theory KO and of topological modular forms tmf, generalizing the \hat{A}- (resp. the Witten) genus. Furthermore, the obstruction to lifting an \mathbb{E}_\infty-String orientations from KO to tmf is identified with a classical Iwasawa-theoretic condition. The common key to all these results is a precise understanding of the classical Kummer congruences, imposed for all primes simultaneously. This result is of independent arithmetic interest.
