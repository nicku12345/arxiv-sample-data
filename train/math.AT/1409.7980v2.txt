The aim of this article is to establish the notion of bundle-type quasitoric manifolds and provide two classification results on them: (1) (\mathbb{C}P^2\sharp\mathbb{C}P^2)-bundle type quasitoric manifolds are weakly equivariantly homeomorphic if their cohomology rings are isomorphic, and (2) quasitoric manifolds over I^3 are homeomorphic if their cohomology rings are isomorphic. In the latter case, there are only four quasitoric manifolds up to weakly equivariant homeomorphism which are not bundle-type.
