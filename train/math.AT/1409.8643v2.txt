Let M be a closed simply connected smooth manifold. Let \F_p be the finite field with p elements where p> 0 is a prime integer. Suppose that M is an \F_p-elliptic space in the sense of [FHT91]. We prove that if the cohomology algebra H^*(M, \F_p) cannot be generated (as an algebra) by one element, then any Riemannian metric on M has an infinite number of geometrically distinct closed geodesics. The starting point is a classical theorem of Gromoll and Meyer [GM69]. The proof uses string homology, in particular the spectral sequence of [CJY04], the main theorem of [McC87], and the structure theorem for elliptic Hopf algebras over \F_p from [FHT91].
