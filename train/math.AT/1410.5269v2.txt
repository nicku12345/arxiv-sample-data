Let E=E_n be Morava E-theory of height n. In previous work Devinatz and Hopkins introduced the K(n)-local E_n-Adams spectral sequence and showed that, under certain conditions, the E_2-term of this spectral sequence can be identified with continuous group cohomology. We work with the category of L-complete E_*E-comodules, and show that in a number of cases the E_2-term of the above spectral sequence can be computed by a relative Ext group in this category. We give suitable conditions for when we can identify this Ext group with continuous group cohomology.
