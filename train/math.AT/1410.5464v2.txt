We give details of models for rational torus equivariant homotopy theory based on (a) all subgroups, connected subgroups or dimensions of subgroups and (b) on pairs or general flags. We provide comparison functors and show the models are equivalent.   This is used in (A) An algebraic model for rational torus equivariant spectra (with B.Shipley; the new version of 1101.2511), (B) An algebraic model for the toral part of rational equivariant G-spectra for an arbitrary compact Lie group (1501.03425) and (C) construction of torus equivariant spectra from algebraic geometric data. It also highlights the role of the localization theorem in these models.
