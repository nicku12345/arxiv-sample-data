In this paper we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a (real) moment-angle complex to be a topological manifold. The cup and cap products in a real moment-angle manifold are studied: the Poincar\'{e} duality via cap products is equivalent to the Alexander duality of the defining complex K. Consequently, the cohomology ring (with coefficients integers) of a polyhedral product by pairs of disks and their bounding spheres is isomorphic to that of a differential graded algebra associated to K, and the dimensions of the disks.
