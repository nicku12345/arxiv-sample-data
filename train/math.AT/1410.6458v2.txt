Growth of the Hilbert-Poincar\"e series for the rational homology of the free loop space of a toric space is addressed. In case the toric space is a manifold, the structure of the fan dictates whether the Hilbert-Poincar\"e series has exponential growth. Applications are made to the existence of infinitely many geometrically distinct periodic geodesics.
