Let I be a small category with finite dimensional nerve, and X\colon I\to Cat a diagram of small categories. We show that, under a "Reedy quasi-fibrancy condition", the homotopy limit of the geometric realization of X is itself the geometric realization of a category. This categorical model for the homotopy limit is defined explicitly, as a category of natural transformations of diagrams. For the poset \bullet\to\bullet\leftarrow\bullet we recover the model for homotopy pullbacks provided by Quillen's Theorem B (specifically Barwick and Kan's version of Quillen's Theorem B_2). For diagrams of cubical shape, this theorem gives a criterion to determine when the geometric realization of a cube of categories is homotopy cartesian.   We further generalize this result to equivariant diagrams of categories. For a finite group G acting on I we show that when X\colon I\to Cat has a G-structure, the realization of the category constructed above is weakly G-equivalent to the homotopy limit of the realization of X. For G-diagrams of cubical shape, this is an equivariant version of Quillen's Theorem B.
