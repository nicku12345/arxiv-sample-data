We modify a classical construction of Bousfield and Kan to define the Adams tower of a simplicial nonunital commutative algebra over a field k. We relate this construction to Radulescu-Banu's cosimplicial resolution, and prove that all connected simplicial algebras are complete with respect to Andr\'e-Quillen homology. This is a convergence result for the unstable Adams spectral sequence for commutative algebras over k.
