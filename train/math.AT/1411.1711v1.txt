We study the limit of the chromatic tower for not necessarily finite spectra, obtaining a generalization of the chromatic convergence theorem of Hopkins and Ravenel. Moreover, we prove that in general this limit does not coincide with harmonic localization, thereby answering a question of Ravenel's.
