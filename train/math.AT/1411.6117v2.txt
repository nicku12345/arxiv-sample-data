This paper aims to give some examples of diffeomorphic (or homeomorphic) low-dimensional complete intersections, which can be considered as a geometrical realization of classification theorems about complete intersections. A conjecture of Libgober and Wood (Topology. 21, 1982, 469--482) will be confirmed by one of examples.
