We give examples of spaces which are good and bad at different primes in the sense of Bousfield and Kan in any arbitrary combination and investigate which impact the existence of a Sylow p-subgroup has on the homotopy type on the classifying space and under which conditions the homotopy type of wedges of classifying spaces is good or bad for a solid ring R. We give results relating to various other R-homological structures and a collection of examples.
