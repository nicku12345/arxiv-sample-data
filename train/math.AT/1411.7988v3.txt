We give a simple universal property of the multiplicative structure on the Thom spectrum of an n-fold loop map, obtained as a special case of a characterization of the algebra structure on the colimit of a lax \mathcal{O}-monoidal functor. This allows us to relate Thom spectra to \mathbb{E}_n-algebras of a given characteristic in the sense of Szymik. As applications, we recover the Hopkins--Mahowald theorem realizing H\mathbb{F}_p and H\mathbb{Z} as Thom spectra, and compute the topological Hochschild homology and the cotangent complex of various Thom spectra.
