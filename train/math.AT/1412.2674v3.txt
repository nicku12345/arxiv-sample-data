In \cite{SCH1} Schuster proved that mod 2 Morava K-theory K(s)^*(BG) is evenly generated for all groups G of order 32. There exist 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. In \cite{H}, these groups are numbered by 1, \cdots ,51. For the groups G_{38},\cdots, G_{41}, that fit in the title, the explicit ring structure is determined in \cite{BJ}. In particular, K(s)^*(BG) is the quotient of a polynomial ring in 6 variables over K(s)^*(pt) by an ideal generated by explicit polynomials. In this article we present some calculations using the same arguments in combination with a theorem of \cite{B0} on good groups in the sense of Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. In particular, we consider the groups G_{36},G_{37}, each isomorphic to a semidirect product (C_4\times C_2\times C_2)\rtimes C_2, the group G_{34}\cong (C_4\times C_4)\rtimes C_2 and its non-split version G_{35}. For these groups the action of C_2 is diagonal, i.e., simpler than for the groups G_{38},\cdots, G_{41}, however the rings K(s)^*(BG) have the same complexity.
