The goal of this paper is to develop some of the machinery necessary for doing K(2)-local computations in the stable homotopy category using duality resolutions at the prime p=2. The Morava stabilizer group \mathbb{S}_2 admits a norm whose kernel we denote by \mathbb{S}_2^1. The algebraic duality resolution is a finite resolution of the trivial \mathbb{Z}_2[[\mathbb{S}_2^1]]-module \mathbb{Z}_2 by modules induced from representations of finite subgroups of \mathbb{S}_2^1. Its construction is due to Goerss, Henn, Mahowald and Rezk. It is an analogue of their finite resolution of the trivial \mathbb{Z}_3[[\mathbb{G}_2^1]]-module \mathbb{Z}_3 at the prime p=3. The construction was never published and it is the main result in this paper. In the process, we give a detailed description of the structure of Morava stabilizer group \mathbb{S}_2 at the prime 2. We also describe the maps in the algebraic duality resolution with the precision necessary for explicit computations.
