Let p be an odd prime. We prove that every rank three p-group acts freely and smoothly on a product of three spheres. To construct this action, we first prove a generalization of a theorem of L\" uck and Oliver on constructions of G-equivariant vector bundles. We also give some other applications of this generalization.
