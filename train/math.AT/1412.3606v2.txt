Let G be the fundamental group of a sapphire that admits the Sol geometry and is not a torus bundle. We determine a finite free resolution of \mathbb{Z} over \mathbb{Z}G and calculate a partial diagonal approximation for this resolution. We also compute the cohomology rings H^*(G; A) for A = \mathbb{Z} and A = \mathbb{Z}/p for an odd prime p, and indicate how to compute the groups H^*(G; A) and the multiplicative structure given by the cup product for any system of coefficients A.
