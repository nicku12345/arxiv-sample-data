In this paper we introduce a new model of random simplicial complexes depending on multiple probability parameters. This model includes the well-known Linial - Meshulam random simplicial complexes and random clique complexes as special cases. Topological and geometric properties of a multi-parameter random simplicial complex depend on the whole combination of the probability parameters and the thresholds for topological properties are convex sets rather than numbers (as in all previously known models). We discuss the containment properties, density domains and dimension of the random simplicial complexes.
