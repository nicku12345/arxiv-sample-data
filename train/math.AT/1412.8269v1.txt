In this paper, we define (reduced) homeology groups and (reduced) cohomeology groups on finite simpicial complexes and prove that these groups are PL homeomorphsm invariants of polyhedra, while they are not homotopy invariants. So these groups can reflect some information that (co)homology groups can not tell. We also define homeotopy type of polyhedra which is finer than homotopy type but coarser than homeomorphism class, and prove that (co)homeology groups are actually homeotopy invariants. In the last section of this paper, we give a geometric description of some special (co)homeology groups.
