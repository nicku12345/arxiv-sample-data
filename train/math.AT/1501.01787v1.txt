In this paper, we consider homology groups induced by the exterior algebra generated by a simplicial compliment of a simplicial complex K. These homology groups are isomorphic to the Tor-groups \mathrm{Tor}_{i, J}^{\mathbf{k}[m]}(\mathbf{k}(K),\mathbf{k}) of the face ring \mathbf{k}(K), which is very useful and much studied in toric topology. By using \check{C}ech homology theory and Alexander duality theorem, we prove that these homology groups have dualities with the simplicial cohomology groups of the full subcomplexes of K. Then we give a new proof of Hochster's theorem.
