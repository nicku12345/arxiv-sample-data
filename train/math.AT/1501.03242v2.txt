For given spaces X and Y, let map(X,Y) and map_\ast(X,Y) be the unbased and based mapping spaces from X to Y, equipped with compact-open topology respectively. Then let map(X,Y;f) and map_\ast(X,Y;g) be the path component of map(X,Y) containing f and map_\ast(X,Y) containing g, respectively. In this paper, we compute cohomotopy groups of suspended complex plane \pi^{n+m}(\Sigma^n \mathbb{C} P^2) for m=6,7. Using these results, we classify path components of the spaces map(\Sigma^n \mathbb{C} P^2,S^m) up to homotopy equivalent. We also determine the generalized Gottlieb groups G_n(\mathbb{C} P^2,S^m). Finally, we compute homotopy groups of mapping spaces map(\Sigma^n \mathbb{C}P^2,S^m;f) for all generators [f] of [\Sigma^n \mathbb{C} P^2,S^m], and Gottlieb groups of mapping components containing constant map map(\Sigma^n \mathbb{C} P^2,S^m;0).
