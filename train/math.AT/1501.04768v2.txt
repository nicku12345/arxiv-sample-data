We consider a sheaf of exterior algebras on a simplicial poset S and introduce a notion of homological characteristic function. Two natural objects are associated with these data: a graded sheaf \mathcal{I} and a graded cosheaf \widehat{\Pi}. When S is a homology manifold, we prove the isomorphism H^{n-1-p}(S;\mathcal{I})\cong H_{p}(S;\widehat{\Pi}) which can be considered as an extension of the Poincare duality. In general, there is a spectral sequence E^2_{p,q}\cong H^{n-1-p}(S;\mathcal{U}_{n-1+q}\otimes \mathcal{I})\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(S;\widehat{\Pi}), where \mathcal{U}_* is the local homology stack on S. This spectral sequence, in turn, extends Zeeman--McCrory spectral sequence. This sheaf-theoretical result is applied to toric topology. We consider a manifold X with a locally standard action of a compact torus and acyclic proper faces of the orbit space. A principal torus bundle Y is associated with X, so that X\cong Y/\sim. The orbit type filtration on X is covered by the topological filtration on Y. We prove that homological spectral sequences associated with these two filtrations are isomorphic in many nontrivial positions.
