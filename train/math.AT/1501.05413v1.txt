Let A be a based subspace of Y. Under the assumptions that Y is path-connected and that the reduced diagonal map of A induces the zero map in all mod 2 reduced homology groups, we compute a formula for the mod 2 reduced Poincar\'{e} series of the loop space \Omega ((A \wedge \mathbb{RP}^\infty) \cup_{A \wedge \mathbb{RP}^1} (Y \wedge \mathbb{RP}^1)). Here \mathbb{RP}^\infty and \mathbb{RP}^1 denote the infinite real projective space and the real projective line respectively.
