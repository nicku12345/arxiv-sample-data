We give estimates for the torsion in the Postnikov sections \tau_{[1, n]} S^0 of the sphere spectrum, and show that the p-localization is annihilated by p^{n/(2p-2) + O(1)}. This leads to explicit bounds on the exponents of the kernel and cokernel of the Hurewicz map \pi_*(X) \to H_*(X; \mathbb{Z}) for a connective spectrum X. Such bounds were first considered by Arlettaz, although our estimates are tighter and we prove that they are the best possible up to a constant factor. As applications, we sharpen existing bounds on the orders of k-invariants in a connective spectrum, sharpen bounds on the unstable Hurewicz of an infinite loop space, and prove an exponent theorem for the equivariant stable stems.
