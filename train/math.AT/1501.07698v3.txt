The mod 2 Lannes-Zarati homomorphism was constructed in \cite{Lan-Zar87}, which is considered as a graded associated version of the mod 2 Hurewicz map in the E_2-term of Adams spectral sequence. The map is studied by many authors such as Lannes-Zarati \cite{Lan-Zar87}, H\horn{u}ng \cite{Hung97}, \cite{Hung2001}, \cite{Hung2003}, H\horn{u}ng et. al. \cite{Hung.et.al2014}, Ch\horn{o}n-Tri\'\^et \cite{Chon.Triet2014}. In this paper, we construct an analogue \varphi_s for p odd, and we also investigate the behavior of this map for s\leq 3.
