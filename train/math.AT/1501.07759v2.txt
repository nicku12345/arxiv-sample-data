Let E_n be Morava E-theory and let G \subset G_n be a finite subgroup of G_n, the extended Morava stabilizer group. Let E_{n}^{tG} be the Tate spectrum, defined as the cofiber of the norm map N:(E_n)_{hG} \to E_n^{hG}. We use the Tate spectral sequence to calculate \pi_*E_{p-1}^{tG} for G a maximal finite p-subgroup, and p an odd prime. We show that E_{p-1}^{tG} \simeq \ast, so that the norm map gives equivalence between homotopy fixed point and homotopy orbit spectra. Our methods also give a calculation of \pi_*E_{p-1}^{hG}, which is a folklore calculation of Hopkins and Miller.
