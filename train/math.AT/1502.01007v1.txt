This article computes some motivic stable homotopy groups over R. For 0 <= p - q <= 3, we describe the motivic stable homotopy groups of a completion of the motivic sphere spectrum. These are the first four Milnor-Witt stems. We start with the known Ext groups over C and apply the rho-Bockstein spectral sequence to obtain Ext groups over R. This is the input to an Adams spectral sequence, which collapses in our low dimensional range.
