The goal of this paper is to prove that the classifying spaces of categories of algebras governed by a prop can be determined by using function spaces on the category of props. We first consider a function space of props to define the moduli space of algebra structures over this prop on an object of the base category. Then we mainly prove that this moduli space is the homotopy fiber of a forgetful map of classifying spaces, generalizing to the prop setting a theorem of Rezk. The crux of our proof lies in the construction of certain universal diagrams in categories of algebras over a prop. We introduce a general method to carry out such constructions in a functorial way.
