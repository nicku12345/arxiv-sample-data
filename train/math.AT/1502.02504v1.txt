We determine higher topological Hochschild homology of rings of integers in number fields with coefficients in suitable residue fields. We use the iterative description of higher THH for this and Postnikov arguments that allow us to reduce the necessary computations to calculations in homological algebra, starting from the results of B\"okstedt and Lindenstrauss-Madsen on (ordinary) topological Hochschild homology.
