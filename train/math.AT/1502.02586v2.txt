We study the lower bounds and upper bounds for LS-category and equivariant LS-category. In particular we compute both invariants for torus manifolds. There are some examples to show the sharpness of conditions in the theorems. Moreover the equivariant LS-category of the product space is discussed and counterexamples of some previous results are given.
