Let G be a compact connected Lie group and let P be a principal G-bundle over K. The gauge group of P is the topological group of automorphisms of P. For fixed G and K, consider all principal G-bundles P over K. It is proved by Crabb--Sutherland and the second author that the number of A_n-types of the gauge groups of P is finite if n<\infty and K is a finite complex. We show that the number of A_\infty-types of the gauge groups of P is infinite if K is a sphere and there are infinitely many P.
