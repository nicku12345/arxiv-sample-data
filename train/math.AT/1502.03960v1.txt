Given a perversity function in the sense of intersection homology theory, the method of intersection spaces assigns to certain oriented stratified spaces cell complexes whose ordinary reduced homology with real coefficients satisfies Poincar\'e duality across complementary perversities. The resulting homology theory is well-known not to be isomorphic to intersection homology. For a two-strata pseudomanifold with product link bundle, we give a description of the cohomology of intersection spaces as a space of weighted L^2 harmonic forms on the regular part, equipped with a fibred scattering metric. Some consequences of our methods for the signature are discussed as well.
