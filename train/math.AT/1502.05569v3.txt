Denote by P_k the graded polynomial algebra \mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k] over the prime field of two elements, \mathbb F_2, with the degree of each x_i being 1. We study the Peterson hit problem of determining a minimal set of generators for P_k as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, \mathcal{A}. In this paper, we explicitly determine a minimal set of \mathcal{A}-generators for P_k in the case k=5 and the degree 4(2^d - 1) with d an arbitrary positive integer.
