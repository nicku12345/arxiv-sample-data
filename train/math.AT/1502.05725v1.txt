We generalize two classical homotopy theory results, the Blakers-Massey Theorem and Quillen's Theorem B, to G-equivariant cubical diagrams of spaces, for a discrete group G. We show that the equivariant Freudenthal suspension Theorem for permutation representations is a direct consequence of the equivariant Blakers-Massey Theorem. We also apply this theorem to generalize to G-manifolds a result about cubes of configuration spaces from embedding calculus. Our proof of the equivariant Theorem B involves a generalization of the classical Theorem B to higher dimensional cubes, as well as a categorical model for finite homotopy limits of classifying spaces of categories.
