We describe the slice spectral sequence of a 32-periodic C_{4}-spectrum K_{[2]} related to the C_{4} norm {N_{C_{2}}^{C_{4}}MU_{\bf R}} of the real cobordism spectrum MU_{\bf R}. We will give it as a spectral sequence of Mackey functors converging to the graded Mackey functor \underline{\pi }_{*}K_{[2]}, complete with differentials and exotic extensions in the Mackey functor structure.   The slice spectral sequence for the 8-periodic real K-theory spectrum K_{\bf R} was first analyzed by Dugger. The C_{8} analog of K_{[2]} is 256-periodic and detects the Kervaire invariant classes \theta_{j} in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. A partial analysis of its slice spectral sequence led to the solution to the Kervaire invariant problem, namely the theorem that \theta_{j} does not exist for j\geq 7.
