Associated to a Coxeter system (W,S) there is a contractible simplicial complex \Sigma called the Davis complex on which W acts properly and cocompactly by reflections. Given a positive real multiparameter \mathbf{q}, one can define the weighted L^2-(co)homology groups of \Sigma and associate to them a nonnegative real number called the weighted L^2-Betti number. Not much is known about the behavior of these groups when \mathbf{q} lies outside a certain restricted range, and weighted L^2-Betti numbers have proven difficult to compute. In this article we propose a program to compute the weighted L^2-(co)homology of \Sigma by considering a thickened version of this complex. The program proves especially successful provided that the weighted L^2-(co)homology of certain infinite special subgroups of W vanishes in low dimensions. We then use our complex to perform computations for many examples of Coxeter groups, in most cases providing explicit formulas for the weighted L^2-Betti numbers.
