Let M be a smooth compact manifold with boundary. Under some geometric conditions on M, a homotopical model for the pair (M,boundary of M) can be recovered from the configuration category of the interior of M. The grouplike monoid of derived homotopy automorphisms of the configuration category of the interior of M then acts on the homotopical model of the pair (M,boundary of M), in a way which is compatible with a known homotopical action of the homeomorphism group of M minus boundary on (M,boundary of M).
