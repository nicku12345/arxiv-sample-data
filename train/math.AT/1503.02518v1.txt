Given a Coxeter system (W,S) there is a contractible simplicial complex \Sigma called the Davis complex on which W acts properly and cocompactly. In an article of Dymara, the weighted L^2-(co)homology groups of \Sigma were defined, and in an article of Davis-Dymara-Januszkiewicz-Okun, the Singer conjecture for Coxeter groups was appropriately formulated for weighted L^2-(co)homology theory. In this article, we prove the weighted version of the Singer conjecture in dimension three under the assumption that the nerve of the Coxeter group is not dual to a hyperbolic simplex, and in dimension four under additional restrictions. We then prove a general version of the conjecture where the nerve of the Coxeter group is assumed to be a flag triangulation of a 3-manifold.
