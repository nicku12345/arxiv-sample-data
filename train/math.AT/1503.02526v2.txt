Using a construction derived from the descending central series of the free groups, we produce filtrations by infinite loop spaces of the classical infinite loop spaces BSU, BU, BSO, BO, BSp, BGL_{\infty}(R)^{+} and Q_0(\mathbb{S}^{0}). We show that these infinite loop spaces are the zero spaces of non-unital E_\infty-ring spectra. We introduce the notion of q-nilpotent K-theory of a CW-complex X for any q\ge 2, which extends the notion of commutative K-theory defined by Adem-G\'omez, and show that it is represented by \mathbb Z\times B(q,U), were B(q,U) is the q-th term of the aforementioned filtration of BU.   For the proof we introduce an alternative way of associating an infinite loop space to a commutative \mathbb{I}-monoid and give criteria when it can be identified with the plus construction on the associated limit space. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a commutative \mathbb{I}-rig and show that they give rise to non-unital E_\infty-ring spectra.
