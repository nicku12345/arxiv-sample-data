Given an algebraic structure on the homology of a chain complex, we define its realization space as a Kan complex whose vertices are the structures up to homotopy realizing this structure at the homology level. Our algebraic structures are parametrised by props and thus include various kinds of bialgebras. We give a general formula to compute subsets of equivalences classes of realizations as quotients of automorphism groups, and determine the higher homotopy groups via the cohomology of deformation complexes. As a motivating example, we compute subsets of equivalences classes of realizations of Poincar\'e duality for several examples of manifolds.
