Stable fold maps are fundamental tools in studying a generalized theory of the theory of Morse functions on smooth manifolds and its application to geometry of the manifolds. It is important to construct explicit fold maps systematically to study smooth manifolds by the theory of fold maps easy to handle. However, such constructions have been difficult in general. Round fold maps are defined as stable fold maps such that the sets of all the singular values are concentric spheres and it was first introduced in 2012--2014. The author studied algebraic and differential topological properties of such maps and their manifolds and constructed explicit round fold maps. For example, the author succeeded in constructing such maps on manifolds regarded as the total spaces of bundles over smooth homotopy spheres by noticing that smooth homotopy spheres admit round fold maps whose singular sets are connected and more generally, new such maps on manifolds regerded as the total space of circle bundles over another manifold admitting a round fold map. In this paper, as an advanced work, we construct new explicit round fold maps on manifolds regarded as the total spaces of bundles such that the fibers are closed smooth manifolds and that the structure groups are linear and more general bundles over a manifold admitting a round fold map.
