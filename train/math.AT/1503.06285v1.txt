In this paper we develop further the multi-parameter model of random simplicial complexes. Firstly, we give an intrinsic characterisation of the multi-parameter probability measure. Secondly, we show that in multi-parameter random simplicial complexes the links of simplexes and their intersections are also multi-parameter random simplicial complexes. Thirdly, we find conditions under which a multi-parameter random simplicial complex is connected and simply connected.
