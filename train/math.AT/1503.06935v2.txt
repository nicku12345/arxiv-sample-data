Let X be a locally symmetric space \Gamma\backslash G/K where G is a connected non-compact semisimple real Lie group with trivial centre, K is a maximal compact subgroup of G, and \Gamma\subset G is a torsion-free irreducible lattice in G. Let Y=\Lambda\backslash H/L be another such space having the same dimension as X. Suppose that real rank of G is at least 2. We show that any f:X\to Y is either null-homotopic or is homotopic to a covering projection of degree an integer that depends only on \Gamma and \Lambda. As a corollary we obtain that the set [X,Y] of homotopy classes of maps from X to Y is finite. We obtain results on the (non-) existence of orientation reversing diffeomorphisms on X as well as the fixed point property for X.
