We give a simple algebraic characterisation of the sectional category of rational maps admitting a homotopy retraction. As a particular case we get the F\'elix-Halperin theorem for rational Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and prove the conjecture of Jessup-Murillo-Parent on rational topological complexity. We also give a characterisation for relative category in the sense of Doeraene-El Haouari.
