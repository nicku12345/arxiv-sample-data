We reformulate the persistent (co)homology of simplicial filtrations, viewed from a more algebraic setting, namely as the (co)homology of a chain complex of graded modules over polynomial ring K[t]. We also define persistent (co)homology of groups, associative algebras, Lie algebras, etc. \par Then we obtain formulas for tensor powers T^n(M),S^n(M),\Lambda^{\!n}(M) where M is a persistence module. We discuss the cyclic and dihedral powers of persistence modules, and more generally quotients of T^n(M) by a group action.
