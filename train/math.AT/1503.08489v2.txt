We consider the cotriple resolution of algebras over operads in differential graded modules. We focus, to be more precise, on the example of algebras over the differential graded Barratt-Eccles operad and on the example of commutative alegbras. We prove that the geometric realization of the cotriple resolution (in the sense of model categories) gives a cofibrant resolution functor on these categories of differential graded algebras.
