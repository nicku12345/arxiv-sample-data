The purpose of this work is to classify, for given integers m,\, n\geq 1, the bordism class of a closed smooth m-manifold X with a free smooth involution \tau with respect to the validity of the {\it Borsuk-Ulam property} that for every continuous map \phi : X \to R^n there exists a point x\in X such that \phi (x)=\phi (\tau (x)). We will classify a given free Z_2-bordism class \alpha according to the three possible cases that (a) all representatives (X , \tau) of \alpha satisfy the Borsuk-Ulam property; \ (b) there are representatives (X_ 1, \tau_1) and (X_2, \tau_2) of \alpha such that (X_1, \tau_1) satisfies the Borsuk-Ulam property but (X_2, \tau_2) does not; \ (c) no representative (X , \tau) of \alpha satisfies the Borsuk-Ulam property.
