This is about Curtis conjecture on the image of the Hurewicz map h:{_2\pi_*}Q_0S^0\to H_*(Q_0S^0;\Z/2). First, we show that if f\in{_2\pi_*^s} is of Adams filtration at least 3 with h(f)\neq 0 then f is not a decomposable element in {_2\pi_*^s}. Moreover, it is shown if k is the least positive integer that f is represented by a cycle in \mathrm{Ext}^{k,k+n}_A(\Z/2,\Z/2), then (i) if e_*h(f)\neq 0 then n\geqslant 2^k-1; (ii) if e_*h(f)=0 then n\geqslant 2^k-2^t for some t>1. Second, for S\subseteq{_2\pi_{*>0}^s} we show that: (i) if the conjecture holds on S, then it holds on \la S\ra; (ii) if h(S)=0 then h acts trivially on any extension of S obtained by applying homotopy operations arising from {_2\pi_*}D_rS^n with n>0. We also provide partial results on the extensions of \la S\ra by taking (possible) Toda brackets of its elements. We also discuss how the EHP-sequence information maybe applied to eliminate classes from being spherical.
