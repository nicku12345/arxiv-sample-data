We consider certain rational homotopical conditions of simly connected CW complex X such that the rational cohomology of the classifying space Baut_1X for fibrations with two-stage fibre X is (not) free. First, we consider when is Baut_1X a rational factor of Baut_1(X\times S^n) for an odd-integer n and observe for a non-formal elliptic space X of rank 3. Second, we compute the Sullivan minimal models of Baut_1X when X are certain non-formal pure spaces of rank 5.
