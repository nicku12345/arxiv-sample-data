We study the stable motivic homotopy groups \pi_{s,w} of the 2-completion of the motivic sphere spectrum over \mathbb{C}. When arranged in the (s,w)-plane, these groups break into four different regions: a vanishing region, an \eta-local region that is entirely known, a \tau-local region that is identical to classical stable homotopy groups, and a region that is not well-understood.
