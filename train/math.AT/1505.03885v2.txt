In previous work of the first author and Jibladze, the E_3-term of the Adams spectral sequence was described as a secondary derived functor, defined via secondary chain complexes in a groupoid-enriched category. This led to computations of the E_3-term using the algebra of secondary cohomology operations. In work with Blanc, an analogous description was provided for all higher terms E_m. In this paper, we introduce 2-track algebras and tertiary chain complexes, and we show that the E_4-term of the Adams spectral sequence is a tertiary Ext group in this sense. This extends the work with Jibladze, while specializing the work with Blanc in a way that should be more amenable to computations.
