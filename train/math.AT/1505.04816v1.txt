Let W be a compact simply connected triangulated manifold with boundary and K \subset W be a subpolyhedron. We construct an algebraic model of the rational homotopy type of the complement W \setminus K out of a model of the map of pairs (K, K \cap \partial W) \to (W,\partial W) under some high codimension hypothesis. We deduce the rational homotopy invariance of the configuration space of two points in a compact manifold with boundary under 2-connectedness hypotheses. Also, we exhibit nice explicits models of these configuration spaces for a large class of compact manifolds.
