We prove that a large class of Poincar\'e duality pairs admit rational models (in the sense of Sullivan) of a particularly nice form associated to some Poincar\'e duality CDGA. These models have applications in particular to the construction of rational models of configuration spaces in compact manifolds with boundary.
