Two homotopy decompositions of supensions of spaces involving polyhedral products are given. The first decomposition is motivated by the decomposition of suspensions of polyhedral products by Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen, and Gitler, and is a generalization of the retractile argument of James. The second decomposition is on the union of an arrangement of subspaces called diagonal subspaces, and generalizes the result of Labbasi.
