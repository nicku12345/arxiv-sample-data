This paper studies the map between polyhedral products \mathcal{Z}_K(C\underline{X},\underline{X})\to\mathcal{Z}_K(\Sigma\underline{X},*) induced from the pinch maps (CX_i,X_i)\to(\Sigma X_i,*), which is the higher order Whitehead product if K is the boundary of a simplex. When K is a shifted complex, a wedge decomposition of \mathcal{Z}_K(C\underline{X},\underline{X}) is given by the authors. Based on this decomposition, when K is shifted, the induced pinch map is explicitly described as a wedge of iterated Whitehead products each of which includes at most one higher product. As a corollary, the Jacobi identity of Whitehead products including higher products due to Hardie is generalized.
