Let M be a simply connected closed manifold of dimension n. We study the rational homotopy type of the configuration space of 2 points in M, F(M,2). When M is even dimensional, we prove that the rational homotopy type of F(M,2) depends only on the rational homotopy type of M. When the dimension of M is odd, for every x\in H^{n-2} (M, \mathbb{Q}), we construct a commutative differential graded algebra C(x). We prove that for some x \in H^{n-2} (M; \mathbb{Q}), C(x) encodes completely the rational homotopy type of F(M,2). For some class of manifolds, we show that we can take x=0.
