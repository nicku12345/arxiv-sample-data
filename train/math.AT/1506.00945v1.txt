In this article, we study the exponents of metastable homotopy of mod 2 Moore spaces. Our result gives that the double loop space of 4n-dimensional mod 2 Moore spaces has a multiplicative exponent 4 below the range of 4 times the connectivity. As a consequence, the homotopy groups of 4n-dimensional mod 2 Moore spaces have an exponent 4 below the range of 4 times the connectivity.
