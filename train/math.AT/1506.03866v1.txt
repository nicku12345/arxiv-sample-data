We give bounds for the module sectional category of products of maps which generalise a theorem of Jessup for Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. We deduce also a proof of a Ganea type conjecture for topological complexity. This is a first step towards proving the Ganea conjecture for topological complexity in the rational context.
