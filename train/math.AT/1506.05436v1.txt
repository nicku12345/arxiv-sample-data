Let M be a simply-connected m dimensional manifold of finite type and k a positif integer. In this paper we show that the rational Betti numbers of each component of the space of immersions of M in \mathbb{R}^{m+k}, have polynomial growth. As consequence, we deduce that, if M is a manifold with Euler characteristic \chi\left(M\right)\leq -2, the Betti numbers of smooth embeddings, Emb\left(M ,\mathbb{R}^{m+k}\right), have exponential growth if k\geq m+1. The main tool of this work is the construction of an explicit model of the space of immersions.
