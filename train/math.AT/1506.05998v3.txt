The notion of a dual polyhedral product is introduced as a generalization of Hovey's definition of Lusternik-Schnirelmann cocategory. Properties established from homotopy decompositions that relate the based loops on a polyhedral product to the based loops on its dual are used to show that if X is a simply-connected space then the weak cocategory of X equals the homotopy nilpotency class of the based loops on X. This answers a fifty year old question posed by Ganea. The methods are applied to determine the homotopy nilpotency class of quasi-p-regular exceptional Lie groups and sporadic p-compact groups.
