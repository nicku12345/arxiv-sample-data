We study b'_1(M), the co-rank of the fundamental group of a smooth closed connected manifold M. We calculate this value for the direct product of manifolds. We characterize the set of all possible combinations of b'_1(M) and the first Betti number b_1(M) by explicitly constructing manifolds with any possible combination of b'_1(M) and b_1(M) in any given dimension. Finally, we apply our results to the topology of Morse form foliations. In particular, we construct a manifold M and a Morse form \omega on it for any possible combination of b'_1(M), b_1(M), m(\omega), and c(\omega), where m(\omega) is the number of minimal components and c(\omega) is the maximum number of homologically independent compact leaves of \omega.
