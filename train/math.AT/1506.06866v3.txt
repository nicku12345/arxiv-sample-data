Given a simple graph G, the graph associahedron P_G is a convex polytope whose facets correspond to the connected induced subgraphs of G. Graph associahedra have been studied widely and are found in a broad range of subjects. Recently, S. Choi and H. Park computed the rational Betti numbers of the real toric variety corresponding to a graph associahedron under the canonical Delzant realization. In this paper, we focus on a pseudograph associahedron which was introduced by Carr, Devadoss and Forcey, and then discuss how to compute the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of the real toric variety corresponding to a pseudograph associahedron under the canonical Delzant realization.
