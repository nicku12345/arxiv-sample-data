Let \mathcal{E}(X) be the group of homotopy classes of self homotopy equivalences for a connected CW complex X. We observe two classes of maps \mathcal{E}-maps and co-\mathcal{E}-maps. They are defined as the maps X\to Y that induce the homomorphisms \mathcal{E}(X)\to \mathcal{E}( Y) and \mathcal{E}(Y)\to \mathcal{E}(X), respectively. We give some rationalized examples related to spheres, Lie groups and homogeneous spaces by using Sullivan models. Furthermore, we introduce an \mathcal{E}-equivalence relation between rationalized spaces X_{\mathbb{Q}} and Y_{\mathbb{Q}} as a geometric realization of an isomorphism \mathcal{E}(X_{\mathbb{Q}})\cong \mathcal{E}(Y_{\mathbb{Q}}).
