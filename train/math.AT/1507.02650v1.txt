We compute the E_2-term of the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence converging to the homotopy groups of the semi-cosimplicial E_{\infty} ring spectrum Q(2)_{(3)}. This 3-local spectrum was constructed by M. Behrens using degree 2 isogenies of elliptic curves, and its localization with respect to the 2nd Morava K-theory K(2) is "one half" of the K(2)-local sphere at the prime 3. The computation in this paper uses techniques developed in the author's previous work on the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for Q(2)_{(3)}, and provides another gateway to the homotopy ring \pi_*Q(2)_{(3)}.
