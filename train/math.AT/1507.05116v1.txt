Using the methods of Ando-Hopkins-Rezk, we describe the characteristic series arising from E-infinity genera valued in topological modular forms with level structure. We give examples of such series for tmf_0(N) and show that the Ochanine genus comes from an E-infinity ring map. We also show that, away from 6, certain tmf orientations of String cobordism descend to orientations of Spin cobordism.
