We first compute the James' sectional category (secat) of the Ganea map g_k of any map f in terms of the sectional category of f: We show that secat(g_k) is the integer part of secat(f)/(k+1). Next we compute the relative category (relcat) of g_k. In order to do this, we introduce the relative category of order k (relcat_k) of a map and show that relcat(g_k) is the integer part of relcat_k(f)/(k+1). Then we establish some inequalities linking secat and relcat of any order: We show that secat(f) <= relcat_k(f) <= secat(f) + k + 1 and relcat_k(f) <= relcat_(k+1)(f) <= relcat_k(f) + 1. We give examples that show that these inequalities may be strict.
