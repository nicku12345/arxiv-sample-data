We show that the cube of the Hopf map \eta maps to zero under the Hurewicz map for all fixed points of all norms to cyclic 2-groups of the Landweber-Araki Real bordism spectrum. Using that the slice spectral sequence is a spectral sequence of Mackey functors, we compute the relevant portion of the homotopy groups of these fixed points, showing that multiplication by 4 annihilates \pi_{3}.
