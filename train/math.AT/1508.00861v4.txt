We define quasicategories of E_n-structured coalgebras, bialagebras and comodules. We show that: n-fold loop spaces, suspension spectra thereof, descent data for maps of E_n-ring spectra, descent corings of morphisms of E_n-ring spectra and Thom spectra are all examples of these kinds of objects. In particular, we prove that for a morphism of E_n-monoidal Kan complexes f:X->BGL_1(R), the associated Thom spectrum Mf is a structured R[X]-comodule by the classical Thom diagonal.
