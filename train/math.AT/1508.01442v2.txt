Extending the model of the interval, we explicitly define for each n\ge 0 a free complete differential graded Lie algebra \mathfrak{L}_n generated by the simplices of \Delta^n, with desuspended degrees, in which the vertices are Maurer-Cartan elements and the differential extends the simplicial chain complex of the standard n-simplex. The family \{\mathfrak{L}_\bullet\}_{n\ge 0} is endowed with a cosimplicial differential graded Lie algebra structure which we use to construct a pair of adjoint functors between the categories of simplicial sets and complete differential graded Lie algebras given by \langle L\rangle_\bullet=\text{ DGL} (\mathfrak{L}_\bullet,L) and  \mathfrak{L}(K)=\varinjlim_K\mathfrak{L}_{\bullet} . This new tools let us extend Quillen rational homotopy theory approach to any simplicial set K whose path components are non necessarily simply connected.   We prove that \mathfrak{L} (K) contains a model of each component of K. When K is a 1-connected finite simplicial complex, the Quillen model of K can be extracted from \mathfrak{L} (K). When K is connected then, for a perturbed differential \partial_a, H_0(\mathfrak{L} (K),\partial_a) is the Malcev Lie completion of \pi_1(K). Analogous results are obtained for the realization \langle L\rangle of any complete \text{DGL}.
