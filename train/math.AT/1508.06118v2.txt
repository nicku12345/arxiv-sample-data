The Porter's approach (G.\ J.\ Porter, \textit{Higher order Whitehead products}, Topology \textbf{3} (1965), 123--135.) is used to derive some properties of higher order Whitehead products, similar to those ones for triple products obtained by Hardie in K.\ A.\ Hardie, \textit{On a construction of E.\ C.\ Zeeman}, Journal London Math.\ Soc.\ \textbf{35} (1960), 452--464.
