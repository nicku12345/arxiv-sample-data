We extend the notion of the exterior Whitehead product for maps \alpha_i:\Sigma A_i \to X_i for i=1,\dots,n, where \Sigma A_i is the reduced suspension of A_i and then, for the interior product with X_i=J_{m_i}(X) as well. The main result stated in Theorem 3.10 generalizes Theorem 1.10 in K.\ A.\ Hardie, \textit{A generalization of the Hopf construction}, Quart.\ J.\ Math.\ Oxford Ser.\ (2) \textbf{12} (1961), 196--204. and concerns to the Hopf invariant of the generalized Hopf construction.   We close the paper applying the Gray's construction \circ (called the Theriault product) to a sequence X_1,\dots,X_n of simply connected co-H-spaces to obtain a higher Gray--Whitehead product map \[w_n:\Sigma^{n-2}(X_1\circ\dots\circ X_n)\to T_1(X_1,\dots,X_n),\] where T_1(X_1,\dots,X_n) is the fat wedge of X_1,\dots,X_n.
