In this note we give a necessary condition for having an almost complex structure on the product S^{2m} \times M, where M is a connected orientable closed manifold. We show that if the Euler characteristic \chi(M) \neq 0, then except for finitely many values of m, we do not have almost complex structure on S^{2m} \times M. In the particular case when M = \mathbb{C}\mathbb P^n, n \neq 1, we show that if n \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4 then S^{2m} \times \mathbb C \mathbb P^{n} has an almost complex structure if and only if m = 1,3. As an application we obtain conditions on the nonexistence of almost complex structure on Dold manifolds.
