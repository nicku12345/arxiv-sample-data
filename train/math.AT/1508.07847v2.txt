We show the compatibility of the differential geometric and the topological construction of equivariant characteristic classes for compact Lie groups. Our analysis motivates a differential geometric construction for equivariant characteristic classes in the non-compact case. This compatibility is generally assumed and used in various cases, but there is only a proof for compact connected Lie groups in the literature, see the work of Raoul Bott and Loring Tu. Our proof applies and generalizes ideas of Johan Dupont and Ezra Getzler.
