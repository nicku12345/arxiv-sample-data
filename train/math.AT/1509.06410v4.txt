In this note we study the homology of configuration spaces of closed manifolds. We sharpen the eventual periodicity results of Nagpal and Cantero-Palmer, prove integral homological stability for configuration spaces of odd-dimensional manifolds and introduce a stabilization map on the homology with Z[1/2]-coefficients of configuration spaces of odd-dimensional manifolds.
