Let A be either a simplicial complex K or a small category \mathcal C with V(A) as its set of vertices or objects. We define a twisted structure on A with coefficients in a simplicial group G as a function  \delta\colon V(A)\longrightarrow \operatorname{End}(G), \quad v\mapsto \delta_v  such that \delta_v\circ \delta_w=\delta_w\circ \delta_v if there exists an edge in A joining v with w or an arrow either from v to w or from w to v. We give a canonical construction of twisted simplicial group as well as twisted homology for A with a given twisted structure. Also we determine the homotopy type of of this simplicial group as the loop space over certain twisted smash product.
