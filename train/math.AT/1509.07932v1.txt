In this paper, we study the stable homotopy types of \mathbf{F}^4_{n(2)}-polyhedra, i.e., (n-1)-connected, at most (n+4)-dimensional polyhedra with 2-torsion free homologies. We are able to classify the indecomposable \mathbf{F}^4_{n(2)}-polyhedra. The proof relies on the matrix problem technique which was developed in the classification of representaions of algebras and applied to homotopy theory by Baues and Drozd.
