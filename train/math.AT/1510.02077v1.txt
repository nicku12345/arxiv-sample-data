The slice filtration is a filtration of equivariant spectra. While the tower is analogous to the Postnikov tower in the nonequivariant setting, complete slice towers are known for relatively few G-spectra. In this paper, we determine the slice tower for all G-spectra of the form S^n \wedge H\underline{\mathbb{Z}} where n\geq 0 and G is a cyclic p-group for p an odd prime.
