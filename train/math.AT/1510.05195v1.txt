In this paper we give a formula for the homotopy groups of (n-1)-connected 2n-manifolds as a direct sum of homotopy groups of spheres in the case the n^{th} Betti number is larger than 1. We demonstrate that when the n^{th} Betti number is 1 the homotopy groups might not have such a decomposition. The techniques used in this computation also yield formulae for homotopy groups of connected sums of sphere products and CW complexes of a similar type. In all the families of spaces considered here, we establish a conjecture of J. C. Moore.
