We construct a family of manifolds, one for each n\geq 2, having a nontrivial Massey n-product in their cohomology. These manifolds turn out to be smooth closed 2-connected manifolds with a compact torus action called moment-angle manifolds \mathcal Z_P, whose orbit spaces are simple n-dimensional polytopes P obtained from a n-cube by a sequence of truncations of faces of codimension 2 only (2-truncated cubes). Moreover, the polytopes P are flag nestohedra but not graph-associahedra. We compute some bigraded Betti numbers \beta^{-i,2(i+1)}(Q) for an associahedron Q in terms of its graph structure and relate it to the structure of the loop homology (Pontryagin algebra) H_{*}(\Omega\mathcal Z_Q). We also study triple Massey products in H^{*}(\mathcal Z_Q) for a graph-associahedron Q.
