In this paper, we construct the chain level representation in the lambda algebra of the Lannes-Zarati homomorphism for \mathbb{F}_2 as well as for \tilde{H}^*B\mathbb{Z}/2. Using this construction, we show that the sixth Lannes-Zarati homomorphism for \mathbb{F}_2 is trivial at all stems t for t\leq 114. Furthermore, using this method, we also investigate the behavior of the Lannes-Zarati homomorphis for \tilde{H}^*B\mathbb{Z}/2 at the homological s\leq 4.
