Let X be an algebraic variety over k such that \bar X=X\otimes_k\bar k is cellular. We study torsion elements in the Chow ring CH^*(X) which corresponds to v_iy in the algebraic cobordism \Omega^*(\bar X) where 0\not=y\in CH^*(\bar X)/p and v_i is the generator of BP^* with |v_i|=-2(p^i-1). In particular, we try to compute CH^*(X) from \Omega^*(\bar X) when X are twisted complete flag varieties.
