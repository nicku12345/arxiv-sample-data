If D is a Reedy category and M is a model category, the category M^{D} of D-diagrams in M is a model category under the Reedy model category structure. If C \to D is a Reedy functor between Reedy categories, then there is an induced functor of diagram categories M^{D} \to M^{C}. Our main result is a characterization of the Reedy functors C \to D that induce right or left Quillen functors M^{D} \to M^{C} for every model category M. We apply these results to various situations, and in particular show that certain important subdiagrams of a fibrant multicosimplicial object are fibrant.
