We show that one can use model categories to construct rational orthogonal calculus. That is, given a continuous functor from vector spaces to based spaces one can construct a tower of approximations to this functor depending only on the rational homology type of the input functor, whose layers are given by rational spectra with an action of O(n). By work of Greenlees and Shipley, we see that these layers are classified by torsion H^*(B SO(n))[O(n)/SO(n)]-modules.
