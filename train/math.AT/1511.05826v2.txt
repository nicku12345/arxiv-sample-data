We construct a (coloured) operad RL in the category of sets that may be thought of as a combinatorial model for the Swiss Cheese operad. By adapting Batanin-Berger's condensation process we obtain a topological (resp. chain) operad weakly equivalent to the topological (resp. chain) Swiss Cheese operad. As an application, we exhibit models for relative loop spaces acted on by Swiss Cheese type operads (in dimension 2).
