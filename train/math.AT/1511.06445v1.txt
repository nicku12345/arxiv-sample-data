We study tautological rings for high dimensional manifolds, that is, for each smooth manifold M the ring R^*(M) of those of characteristic classes of smooth fibre bundles with fibre M which is generated by generalised Miller--Morita--Mumford classes. We completely describe these rings modulo nilpotent elements, when M is a connected sum of copies of S^n \times S^n for n odd.
