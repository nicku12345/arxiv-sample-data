We describe the multiplicative structures that arise on categories of equivariant modules over certain equivariant commutative ring spectra. Building on our previous work on N-infinity ring spectra, we construct categories of equivariant operadic modules over N-infinity rings that are structured by equivariant linear isometries operads. These categories of modules are endowed with equivariant symmetric monoidal structures, which amounts to the structure of an "incomplete Mackey functor in homotopical categories". In particular, we construct internal norms which satisfy the double coset formula. We regard the work of this paper as a first step towards equivariant derived algebraic geometry.
