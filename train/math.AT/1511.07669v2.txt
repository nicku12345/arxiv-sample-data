In this paper an algebraic model for unbased rational homotopy theory from the perspective of curved Lie algebras is constructed. As part of this construction a model structure for the category of pseudo-compact curved Lie algebras with curved morphisms will be introduced; one which is Quillen equivalent to a certain model structure of unital commutative differential graded algebras, thus extending the known Quillen equivalence of augmented algebras and differential graded Lie algebras.
