An affine Hopf fibration is a fibration of n-dimensional real affine space by p-dimensional pairwise skew affine subspaces. An example is a fibration of 3-space by pairwise skew lines, the result of the central projection of the classical Hopf fibration of 3-sphere. In this expository article, we describe the solution of the following problem: for which values of n and p does an affine Hopf fibration exist? The answer is given in terms of the Hurwitz-Radon function.
