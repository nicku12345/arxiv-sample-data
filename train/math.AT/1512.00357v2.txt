A phantom map is a potentially nontrivial map which induces the zero map on every homology theory and on homotopy groups. Zabrodsky has shown that in the presence of particular finiteness conditions on spaces X and Y every map X\to Y is a phantom map. More specifically, Zabrodsky essentially requires Y to be a finite CW complex and X to be a Postnikov space. We show Zabrodsky's observations hold under less restrictive finiteness conditions on the spaces X and Y, making use of the Zabrodsky lemma and the machinery of resolving classes.   As an application we identify, up to extension, the group of self-homotopy equivalences of spaces belonging to a particular family.
