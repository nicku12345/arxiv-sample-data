This paper is on the Curtis conjecture. We show that the image of the Hurewicz homomorhism h:\pi_*Q_0S^0\to H_*(Q_0S^0;\mathbb{Z}), when restricted to product of positive dimensional elements, is determined by \mathbb{Z}\{h(\eta^2),h(\nu^2),h(\sigma^2)\}. Localised at p=2, this proves a geometric version of a result of Hung and Peterson for the Lannes-Zarati homomorphism. We apply this to show that, for p=2 and G=O(1) or any prime p and G any compact Lie group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{g} so that \dim\mathfrak{g}>0, the composition {_p\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{n\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{\wedge n}\to {_p\pi_*}Q_0S^0\stackrel{h}{\to}H_*(Q_0S^0;\mathbb{Z}/p) where \Sigma^{n\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{\wedge n}\to S^0 is the n-fold transfer, is trivial if n>2. Moreover, we show that for n=2, the image of the above composition vanishes on all elements of Adams filtration at least 1, i.e. those elements of {_2\pi_*^s}\Sigma^{n\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{\wedge n} represented by a permanent cycle \mathrm{Ext}_{A_p}^{s,t}(\widetilde{H}^*\Sigma^{n\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{\wedge n},\mathbb{Z}/p) with s>0, map trivially under the above composition. The case of n>2 of the above observation proves and generalises a geometric variant of the weak conjecture on spherical classes due to Hung, later on verified by Hung and Nam. We also show that, for a compact Lie group G, Curtis conjecture holds if we restrict to the image of the n-fold transfer \Sigma^{n\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{\wedge n}\to S^0 with n>1. Finally, we show that the Kervaire invariant one elements \theta_j\in{_2\pi_{2^{j+1}-2}^s} with j>3 do not factorise through the n-fold transfer \Sigma^{n\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{\wedge n}\to S^0 with n>1 for G=O(1) or any compact Lie group as above.
