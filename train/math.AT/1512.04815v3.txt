In this paper we prove that for any simplicial set B, there is a Quillen equivalence between the covariant model structure on \mathbf{S}/B and a certain localization of the projective model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves on the simplex category \Delta/B of B. We extend this result to give a new Quillen equivalence between this covariant model structure and the projective model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves on the simplicial category \mathfrak{C}[B]. We study the relationship with Lurie's straightening theorem. Along the way we prove some results on localizations of simplicial categories and quasi-categories.
