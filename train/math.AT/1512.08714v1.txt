In this paper we study the notion of critical dimension of random simplicial complexes in the general multi-parameter model described in our previous papers of this series. This model includes as special cases the Linial-Meshulam-Wallach model as well as the clique complexes of random graphs. We characterise the concept of critical dimension in terms of various geometric and topological properties of random simplicial complexes such as their Betti numbers, the fundamental group, the size of minimal cycles and the degrees of simplexes. We mention in the text a few interesting open questions.
