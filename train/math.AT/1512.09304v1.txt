The James fibrations give rise to the geometric EHP sequences of homotopy groups of spheres. Using techniques from the Lambda algebra, \cite{BCKQRS66} shows that there are similar long exact sequences of Ext groups defining the E_{2}-page of the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence (also known as the unstable Adams spectral sequence) computing homotopy groups of spheres. In this paper, we give another proof for this phenomenon.
