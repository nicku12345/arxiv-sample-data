In this note, we use Curtis's algorithm and the Lambda algebra to compute the algebraic Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence of the suspension spectrum of \mathbb{R}P^\infty with the aid of a computer, which gives us its Adams E_2-page in the range of t<72. We also compute the transfer map on the Adams E_2-pages. These data are used in our computations of the stable homotopy groups of \mathbb{R}P^\infty in [6] and of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in [7].
