Let A be a cocommutative finite dimensional Hopf algebra over the field with two elements, satisfying some mild hypothesis. We set up a descent spectral sequence which computes the Picard group of the stable category of modules over A. The starting point is the observation that the stable category of A-modules can be reconstructed, as an \infty-category, as the totalization of a cosimplicial \infty-category whose layers are related to the stable categories of modules over the quasi-elementary sub-Hopf-algebras of A. This leads to a spectral sequence computing the Picard group which, in some cases, is completely understood. This also leads to a spectral sequence answering a lifting problem in the category of A-modules. We then show how to apply this machinery to compute Picard groups and solve lifting problems in the case of \mathcal{A}(1)-modules, where \mathcal{A}(1) is the subalgebra of the Steenrod algebra generated by the two first Steenrod squares.
