We show that a large number of Thom spectra, i.e. colimits of morphisms BG\to BGL_1(\mathbb{S}), can be obtained as iterated Thom spectra, i.e. colimits of morphisms BG\to BGL_1(Mf) for some Thom spectrum Mf. This leads to a number of new relative Thom isomorphisms, e.g. MU[6,\infty)\wedge_{MString} MU[6,\infty)\simeq MU[6,\infty)\wedge\mathbb{S}[B^3Spin]. As an example of interest to chromatic homotopy theorists, we also show that Ravenel's X(n) filtration of MU is a tower of intermediate Thom spectra determined by a natural filtration of BU by sub-bialagebras.
