For n\geq 2 we consider (n-1)-connected closed manifolds of dimension at most (3n-2). We prove that away from a finite set of primes, the p-local homotopy groups of M are determined by the dimension of the space of indecomposable elements in the cohomology ring H^\ast(M). Moreover, we show that these p-local homotopy groups can be expressed as direct sum of p-local homotopy groups of spheres. This generalizes some of the results of our earlier work.
