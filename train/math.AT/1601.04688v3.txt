Let G be a real linear algebraic group and L a finitely generated cosimplicial group. We prove that the space of homomorphisms Hom(L_n,G) has a homotopy stable decomposition for each n\geq 1. When G is a compact Lie group, we show that the decomposition is G-equivariant with respect to the induced action of conjugation by elements of G. The spaces Hom(L_n,G) assemble into a simplicial space Hom(L,G). When G=U we show that its geometric realization B(L,U), has a non-unital E_\infty-ring space structure whenever Hom(L_0,U(m)) is path connected for all m\geq1.
