Let \ell be a prime and q = p^{\nu} where p is a prime different from \ell. We show that the \ell-completion of the nth stable homotopy group of spheres is a summand of the \ell-completion of the (n, 0) motivic stable homotopy group of spheres over the finite field with q elements F_q. With this, and assisted by computer calculations, we are able to explicitly compute the two-complete stable motivic stems \pi_{n, 0}(F_q)^{\wedge}_2 for 0\leq n\leq 18. Additionally, we compute \pi_{19, 0}(F_q)^{\wedge}_2 and \pi_{20, 0}(F_q)^{\wedge}_2 when q \equiv 1 \bmod 4 assuming Morel's connectivity theorem for F_q holds.
