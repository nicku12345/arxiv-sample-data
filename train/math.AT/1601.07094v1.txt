It is a well known result in the covering groups that a subgroup G of the fundamental group at the identity of a semi-locally simply connected topological group determines a covering morphism of topological groups with characteristic group G. In this paper we generalize this result to a large class of algebraic objects called topological groups with operations, including topological groups. We also give the cover of crossed modules within topological groups with operations.
