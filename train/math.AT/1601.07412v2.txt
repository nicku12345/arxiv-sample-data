Let A be a commutative algebra over the field {\mathbb F}_2 = {\mathbb Z}/2. We show that there is a natural algebra homomorphism \ell (A) \to HC^-_*(A) which is an isomorphism when A is a smooth algebra. Thus, the functor \ell can be viewed as an approximation of negative cyclic homology and ordinary cyclic homology HC_*(A) is a natural \ell (A)-module. In general, there is a spectral sequence E^2 = L_*(\ell )(A) \Rightarrow HC_*^- (A). We find associated approximation functors \ell^+ and \ell^{per} for ordinary cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology, and set up their spectral sequences. Finally, we discuss universality of the approximations.
