By the classical result of Milnor and Novikov, the unitary cobordism ring is isomorphic to a graded polynomial ring with countably many generators: \Omega^U_*\simeq \mathbb Z[a_1,a_2,\dots], {\rm deg}(a_i)=2i. In this paper we solve a well-known problem of constructing geometric representatives for a_i among smooth projective toric varieties, a_n=[X^{n}], \dim_\mathbb C X^{n}=n. Our proof uses a family of equivariant modifications (birational isomorphisms) B_k(X)\to X of an arbitrary smooth complex manifold X of (complex) dimension n (n\geq 2, k=0,\dots,n-2). The key fact is that the change of the Milnor number under these modifications depends only on the dimension n and the number k and does not depend on the manifold X itself.
