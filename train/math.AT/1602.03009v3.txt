Topological invariance of the intersection homology of a pseudomanifold without codimension one strata, proven by Goresky and MacPherson, is one of the main features of this homology. This property is true for codimension-dependent perversities with some growth conditions, verifying \overline p(1)=\overline p(2)=0. King reproves this invariance by associating an intrinsic pseudomanifold X^* to any pseudomanifold X. His proof consists of an isomorphism between the associated intersection homologies H^{\overline{p}}_{*}(X) \cong H^{\overline{p}}_{*}( X^*) for any perversity \overline{p} with the same growth conditions verifying \overline p(1)\geq 0.   In this work, we prove a certain topological invariance within the framework of strata-dependent perversities, \overline{p}, which corresponds to the classical topological invariance if \overline{p} is a GM-perversity. We also extend it to the tame intersection homology, a variation of the intersection homology, particularly suited for ``large'' perversities, if there is no singular strata on X becoming regular in X^*. In particular, under the above conditions, the intersection homology and the tame intersection homology are invariant under a refinement of the stratification.
