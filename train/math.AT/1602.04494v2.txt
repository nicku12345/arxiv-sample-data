Viewing Kan complexes as \infty-groupoids implies that pointed and connected Kan complexes are to be viewed as \infty-groups. A fundamental question is then: to what extent can one "do group theory" with these objects? In this paper we develop a notion of a finite \infty-group: an \infty-group with finitely many non-trivial homotopy groups which are all finite. We prove a homotopical analog of the Sylow theorems for finite \infty-groups. We derive two corollaries: the first is a homotopical analog of the Burnside's fixed point lemma for p-groups and the second is a "group-theoretic" characterization of (finite) nilpotent spaces.
