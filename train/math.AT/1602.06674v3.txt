A classic result states that on any locally contractible and paracompact topological space, singular cohomology and sheaf cohomology are isomorphic. A result by Ramanan claims that the paracompactness assumption may be removed, but Ramanan's proof in fact implicitly relies on the assumption of paracompactness and does not work in the stated generality. This paper gives a modified proof that, in fact, singular cohomology and sheaf cohomology agree on any locally contractible topological space.
