In this paper, we prove the multiplicativity of the K\"unneth spectral sequence. This is established by an analogue of the Comparison Theorem from homological algebra, which we suspect may be useful for other spectral sequences. This multiplicativity is then used to compute the action of the Dyer-Lashof algebra on \HF_p \wedge_{ku} \HF_p, \HF_p \wedge_{\BP} \HF_p, and part of the action on \HF_p \wedge_{MU} \HF_p. We then relate these computations to the construction of commutative R-algebra structures on commutative \HF_p-algebras. In the case of MU, we obtain a necessary closure condition on ideals I\subset MU_* such that MU/I can be realized as a commutative MU-algebra.
