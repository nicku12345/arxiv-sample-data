Let f_1,..., f_k:X\to N be maps from a complex X to a compact manifold N, k\ge 2. In previous works \cite{BLM,MS}, a Lefschetz type theorem was established so that the non-vanishing of a Lefschetz type coincidence class L(f_1,...,f_k) implies the existence of a coincidence x\in X such that f_1(x)=...=f_k(x). In this paper, we investigate the converse of the Lefschetz coincidence theorem for multiple maps. In particular, we study the obstruction to deforming the maps f_1,...,f_k to be coincidence free. We construct an example of two maps f_1,f_2:M\to T from a sympletic 4-manifold M to the 2-torus T such that f_1 and f_2 cannot be homotopic to coincidence free maps but for {\it any} f:M\to T, the maps f_1,f_2,f are deformable to be coincidence free.
