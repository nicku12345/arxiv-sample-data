In this paper, we are interested in study subgroups of topologized fundamental groups and their influences on generalized covering maps. More precisely, we find some relationships between generalized covering subgroups and the other famous subgroups of the fundamental group equipped with the compact-open topology and the whisker topology. Moreover, we present some conditions under which generalized coverings, semicoverings and coverings are equal.
