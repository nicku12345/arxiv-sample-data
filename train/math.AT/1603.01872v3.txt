We prove that the Becker-Gottlieb transfer is functorial up to homotopy, for all fibrations with finitely dominated fibers. This resolves a lingering foundational question about the transfer, which was originally defined in the late 1970s in order to simplify the proof of the Adams conjecture. Our approach differs from previous attempts in that we closely emulate the geometric argument in the case of a smooth fiber bundle. This leads to a "multiplicative'" description of the transfer, different from the standard presentation as the trace of a diagonal map.
