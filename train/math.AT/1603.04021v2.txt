Let C_{m}  be a cyclic group of order m. We prove that if the group G fits into an extension 1\to C_{2^{n+1}}^2\to G\to C_2\to 1 then G is good in the sense of Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel, i.e., K(s)^*(BG) is evenly generated by transfers of Euler classes of complex representations of subgroups of G. Previously this fact was known for n=1.
