Let X be an (8k+i)-dimensional pathwise connected CW-complex with i=1 or 2 and k\ge0, \xi be a real vector bundle over X. Suppose that \xi admits a stable complex structure over the 8k-skeleton of X. Then we get that \xi admits a stable complex structure over X if the Steenrod square \mathrm{Sq}^{2}\colon H^{8k-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}/2)\rightarrow H^{8k+1}(X;\mathbb{Z}/2) is surjective. As an application, let M be a 10-dimensional manifold with no 2-torsion in H_{i}(M;\mathbb{Z}) for i=1,2,3, and no 3-torsion in H_{1}(M;\mathbb{Z}). Suppose that the Steenrod square \mathrm{Sq}^{2}\colon H^{7}(M;\mathbb{Z}/2)\rightarrow H^{9}(M;\mathbb{Z}/2) is surjective. Then the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a stable almost complex structure on M are given in terms of the cohomology ring and characteristic classes of M.
