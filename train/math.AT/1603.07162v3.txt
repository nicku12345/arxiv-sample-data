In the present work, we extract pairs of topological spaces from maps between coloured operads. We prove that those pairs are weakly equivalent to explicit algebras over the one dimensional Swiss-Cheese operad SC_{1}. Thereafter, we show that the pair formed by the space of long knots and the polynomial approximation of (k)-immerions from R^{d} to R^{n} is an SC_{d+1}-algebra assuming the Dwyer-Hess'conjecture.
