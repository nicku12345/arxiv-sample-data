The paper is devoted to the problem when a map from some closed connected manifold to an aspherical closed manifold approximately fibers, i.e., is homotopic to Manifold Approximate Fibration. We define obstructions in algebraic K-theory. Their vanishing is necessary and under certain conditions sufficient. Basic ingredients are Quinn's thin h-Cobordism Theorem and End Theorem, and knowledge about the Farrell-Jones Conjectures in algebraic K- and L-theory and the MAF-Rigidity Conjecture by Hughes-Taylor-Williams.
