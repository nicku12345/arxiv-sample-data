It is known that the usual Schur S- and P-polynomials can be described via the Gysin homomorphisms for flag bundles in the ordinary cohomology theory. Recently, P. Pragacz generalized these Gysin formulas to the Hall-Littlewood polynomials. In this paper, we introduce a {\it universal} analogue of the Hall-Littlewood polynomials, which we call the {\it universal Hall-Littlewood functions}, and give Gysin formulas for various flag bundles in the complex cobordism theory. Furthermore, we give two kinds of the {\it universal} analogue of the schur polynomials, and some Gysin formulas for these functions are established.
