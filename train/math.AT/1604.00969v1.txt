Uchillo-Ibanez et al. introduced a topology on the sets of shape morphisms between arbitrary topological spaces in 1999. In this paper, applying a similar idea, we introduce a topology on the set of coarse shape morphisms Sh^*(X,Y), for arbitrary topological spaces X and Y. In particular, we can consider a topology on the coarse shape homotopy group of a topological space (X,x), Sh^*((S^k,*),(X,x))=\check{\pi}_k^{*}(X,x), which makes it a Hausdorff topological group. Moreover, we study some properties of these topological coarse shape homotopoy groups such as second countability, movability and in particullar, we prove that \check{\pi}_k^{*^{top}} preserves finite product of compact Hausdorff spaces. Also, we show that for a pointed topological space (X,x), \check{\pi}_k^{top}(X,x) can be embedded in \check{\pi}_k^{*^{top}}(X,x).
