In this paper we study the rational homotopy of the space of immersions, Imm\left(M,N\right), of a manifold M of dimension m\geq 0 into a manifold N of dimension m+k, with k\geq 2. In the special case when N=\mathbb{R}^{m+k} and k is odd we prove that each connected component of Imm\left(M,\mathbb{R}^{m+k}\right) has the rational homotopy type of product of Eilenberg Mac Lane space. We give an explicit description of each connected component and prove that it only depends on m, k and the rational Betti numbers of M. For a more general manifold N, we prove that the path connected of Imm\left(M,N\right) has the rational homotopy type of some component of an explicit mapping space when some Pontryagin classes vanishes.
