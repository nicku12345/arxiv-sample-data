We study torsion in the integral cohomology of a certain family of 2n-dimensional orbifolds X with actions of the n-dimensional compact torus. Compact simplicial toric varieties are in our family. For a prime number p, we find a necessary condition for the integral cohomology of X to have no p-torsion. Then we prove that the necessary condition is sufficient in some cases. We also give an example of X which shows that the necessary condition is not sufficient in general.
