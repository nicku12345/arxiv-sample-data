For a simplicial complex K with m vertices, there is a canonical \mathbb Z_2^m-space known as a real moment angle complex \mathbb R \mathcal Z_K. In this paper, we consider the quotient spaces Y=\mathbb R \mathcal Z_K / \mathbb Z_2^{k}, where K is a pure shellable complex and \mathbb Z_2^k \subset \mathbb Z_2^m is a maximal free action on \mathbb R \mathcal Z_K. A typical example of such spaces is a small cover, where a small cover is known as a topological analog of a real toric manifold. We compute the integral cohomology group of Y by using the PL cell decomposition obtained from a shelling of K. In addition, we compute the Bockstein spectral sequence of Y explicitly.
