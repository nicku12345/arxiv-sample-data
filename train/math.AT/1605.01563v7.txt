We show that when a simplicial Lie group acts on a simplicial manifold \{X_*\}, we can construct a bisimplicial manifold and the de Rham complex on it. This complex is quasi-isomorphic to the equivariant simplicial de Rham complex on \{X_*\} and its cohomology group is isomorphic to the cohomology group of the fat realization of the bisimplicial manifold. We also exhibit a cocycle in the equivariant simplicial de Rham complex.
