Let \varphi and \varphi' be two homotopic actions of the topological group G on the topological space X. To an object A in the G-equivariant derived category D_{\varphi}(X) of X relative to the action \varphi we associate an object A' of category D_{\varphi'}(X), such that the corresponding G-equivariant compactly supported cohomologies H_{G,c}(X,\,A) and H_{G,c}(X,\,A') are isomorphic. When G is a Lie group and X is a subanalytic space, we prove that the G-equivariant cohomologies H_{G}(X,\,A) and H_{G}(X,\,A') are also isomorphic.
