The existence of a model structure on the category \mathcal{D} of diffeological spaces is crucial to developing smooth homotopy theory. We construct a compactly generated model structure on the category \mathcal{D} whose weak equivalences are just smooth maps inducing isomorphisms on smooth homotopy groups. The essential part of our construction of the model structure on \mathcal{D} is to introduce diffeologies on the sets \Delta^{p} (p \geq 0) such that \Delta^{p} contains the k^{th} horn \Lambda^{p}_{k} as a smooth deformation retract.
