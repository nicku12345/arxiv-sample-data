We define and study twisted Alexander-type invariants of complex hypersurface complements. We investigate torsion properties for the twisted Alexander modules and extend classical local-to-global divisibility results to the twisted setting. In the process, we also study the splitting fields containing the roots of the corresponding twisted Alexander polynomials.
