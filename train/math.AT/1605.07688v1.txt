This paper but section 6 is essentially my lecture at The Eighth Congress of Romanian Mathematicians, June 26 - July 1, 2015, Iasi, Romania. The paper summarizes the definitions and the properties of the invariants associated to a real or an angle valued map in the framework of what we call an Alternative to Morse-Novikov theory. These invariants are configurations of points in the complex plane, configurations of vector spaces or modules indexed by complex numbers and collections of Jordan cells. The first are refinements of Betti numbers, the second of homology and the third of monodromy. Although not discussed in this paper but discussed in works this report is based on, these invariants are computer friendly (i.e. can be calculated by computer implementable algorithms when the source of the map is a simplicial complex and the map is simplicial) and are of relevance for the dynamics of flows which admit Lyapunov real or angle valued map.
