For positive integers m and s, let \mathbf{m}_s stand for the s-th tuple (m,\ldots,m). We show that, for large enough s, the higher topological complexity TC_s of an even dimensional real projective space RP^m is characterized as the smallest positive integer k=k(m,s) for which there is a (\mathbb{Z}_2)^{s-1}-equivariant map from Davis' projective product space P_{\mathbf{m}_s} to the (k+1)-th join-power ((\mathbb{Z}_2)^{s-1})^{\ast(k+1)}. This is a (partial) generalization of Farber-Tabachnikov-Yuzvinsky's work relating TC_2 to the immersion dimension of real projective spaces. In addition, we compute the exact value of TC_s(RP^m) for m even and s large enough.
