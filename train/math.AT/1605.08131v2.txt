As more of topology's tools become popular in analyzing high dimensional data sets, the goal of understanding the underlying probabilistic properties of these tools becomes even more important. While much attention has been given to understanding the probabilistic properties of methods that use homological groups in topological data analysis, the probabilistic properties of methods that employ cohomology operations remain unstudied. In this paper, we investigate the Bockstein operator with randomness in a strictly algebraic setting.
