We show that the Picard group Pic(A(1)) of the stable category of modules over \mathbb{C}-motivic A(1) is isomorphic to \mathbb{Z}^4. By comparison, the Picard group of classical A(1) is \mathbb{Z}^2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2. One extra copy of \mathbb{Z} arises from the motivic bigrading. The joker is a well-known exotic element of order 2 in the Picard group of classical A(1). The \mathbb{C}-motivic joker has infinite order.
