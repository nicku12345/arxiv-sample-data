We study the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence at an odd prime l over the base fields \mathbb{C} and \mathbb{R}. This spectral sequence converges to the stable motivic homotopy groups of the l-completed motivic sphere spectrum. We show that the spectral sequence is determined by the topological Adams-Novikov sequence, similar to the situation at the prime two over the base field \mathbb{C}.
