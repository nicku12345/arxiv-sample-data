In a previous work, we have associated a complete differential graded Lie algebra to any finite simplicial complex in a functorial way. Similarly, we have also a realization functor from the category of complete differential graded Lie algebras to the category of simplicial sets. We have already interpreted the homology of a Lie algebra in terms of homotopy groups of its realization. In this paper, we begin a dictionary between models and simplicial complexes by establishing a correspondence between the Deligne groupoid of the model and the connected components of the finite simplicial complex.
