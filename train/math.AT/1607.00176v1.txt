In this paper, by reviewing the concept of subcovering and semicovering maps, we extend the notion of subcovering map to subsemicovering map. We present some necessary or sufficient conditions for a local homeomorphism to be a subsemicovering map. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between these conditions by some examples. Finally, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subsemicovering map to be semicovering.
