Let P_k:= \mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k] be the polynomial algebra over the prime field of two elements, \mathbb F_2, in k variables x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k, each of degree 1. We are interested in the Peterson hit problem of finding a minimal set of generators for P_k as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, \mathcal{A}. In this paper, we study the hit problem in degree (k-1)(2^d-1) with d a positive integer. Our result implies the one of Mothebe [4,5].
