In this paper we develop methods for classifying Baker-Richter-Szymik's Azumaya algebras over a commutative ring spectrum, especially in the largely inaccessible case where the ring is nonconnective. We give obstruction-theoretic tools, constructing and classifying these algebras and their automorphisms with Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory, and give descent-theoretic tools, applying Lurie's work on \infty-categories to show that a finite Galois extension of rings in the sense of Rognes becomes a homotopy fixed-point equivalence on Brauer spaces.   For even-periodic ring spectra E, we find that the "algebraic" Azumaya algebras whose coefficient ring is projective are governed by the Brauer-Wall group of \pi_0(E), recovering a result of Baker-Richter-Szymik. This allows us to calculate many examples. For example, we find that the algebraic Azumaya algebras over Lubin-Tate spectra have either 4 or 2 Morita equivalence classes depending on whether the prime is odd or even, that all algebraic Azumaya algebras over the complex K-theory spectrum KU are Morita trivial, and that the group of the Morita classes of algebraic Azumaya algebras over the localization KU[1/2] is \Bbb Z/8 \times \Bbb Z/2.   Using our descent results and an obstruction theory spectral sequence, we also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum KO which become Morita-trivial KU-algebras. We show that there exist exactly two Morita equivalence classes of these. The nontrivial Morita equivalence class is realized by an "exotic" KO-algebra with the same coefficient ring as End_{KO}(KU). This requires a careful analysis of what happens in the homotopy fixed-point spectral sequence for the Picard space of KU, previously studied by Mathew and Stojanoska.
