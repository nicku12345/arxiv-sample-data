Following Hu and Kriz, we study the C_2-spectra BP\mathbb{R}\langle n \rangle and E\mathbb{R}(n) that refine the usual truncated Brown-Peterson and the Johnson-Wilson spectra. In particular, we show that they satisfy Gorenstein duality with a representation grading shift and identify their Anderson duals. We also compute the associated local cohomology spectral sequence in the cases n=1 and 2.
