Let R=\mathbb{F}_p or a field of characteristic 0. For each R-good topological space Y, we define a collection of higher cohomology operations which, together with the cohomology algebra H^*(Y;R) suffice to determine Y up to R-completion. We also provide a similar collection of higher cohomology operations which determine when two maps f_0,f_1: Z\to Y between R-good spaces(inducing the same algebraic homomorphism H^*(Y;R)\to H^*(Z;R)) are R-equivalent.
