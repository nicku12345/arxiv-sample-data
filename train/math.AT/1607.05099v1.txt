We present an efficient algorithm for the construction of a basis of H_2(\overline{\Omega},\partial\Omega;\mathbb Z) via the Poincar\'e--Lefschetz duality theorem. Denoting by g the first Betti number of \overline \Omega the idea is to find, first g different 1-boundaries of \overline{\Omega} with supports contained in \partial\Omega whose homology classes in \mathbb R^3 \setminus \Omega form a basis of H_1(\mathbb R^3 \setminus \Omega;\mathbb Z), and then to construct in \overline{\Omega} a homological Seifert surface of each one of these 1-boundaries. The Poincar\'e--Lefschetz duality theorem ensures that the relative homology classes of these homological Seifert surfaces in \overline\Omega modulo \partial\Omega form a basis of H_2(\overline\Omega,\partial\Omega;\mathbb Z). We devise a simply procedure for the construction of the required set of 1-boundaries of \overline{\Omega} that, combined with a fast algorithm for the construction of homological Seifert surfaces, allows the efficient computation of a basis of H_2(\overline{\Omega},\partial\Omega;\mathbb Z) via this very natural geometrical approach. Some numerical experiments show the efficiency of the method and its performance comparing with other algorithms.
