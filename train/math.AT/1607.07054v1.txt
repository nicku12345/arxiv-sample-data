K. Borsuk in 1979, in the Topological Conference in Moscow, introduced the concept of the capacity of a compactum and asked some questions concerning properties of the capacity of compacta. In this paper, we give partial positive answers to three of these questions in some cases. In fact, by describing spaces homotopy dominated by Moore and Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, we obtain the capacity of a Moore space M(A,n) and an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(G,n). Also, we compute the capacity of the wedge sum of finitely many Moore spaces of different degrees and the capacity of the product of finitely many Eilenberg-MacLane spaces of different homotopy types. In particular, we give exact capacity of the wedge sum of finitely many spheres of the same or different dimensions.
