The topological complexity of a path-connected space X, denoted TC(X), can be thought of as the minimum number of continuous rules needed to describe how to move from one point in X to another. The space X is often interpreted as a configuration space in some real-life context. Here, we consider the case where X is the space of configurations of n points on a tree \Gamma. We will be interested in two such configuration spaces. In the, first, denoted C^n(\Gamma), the points are distinguishable, while in the second, UC^n(\Gamma), the points are indistinguishable. We determine TC(UC^n(\Gamma)) for any tree \Gamma and many values of n, and consequently determine TC(C^n(\Gamma)) for the same values of n (provided the configuration spaces are path-connected).
