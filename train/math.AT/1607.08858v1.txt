Let X be a two-cell complex with attaching map \alpha\colon S^q\to S^p, and let C_X be the cofiber of the diagonal inclusion X\to X\times X. It is shown that the topological complexity ({\rm TC}) of X agrees with the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category ({\rm cat}) of C_X in the (almost stable) range q\leq2p-1. In addition, the equality {\rm TC}(X)={\rm cat}(C_X) is proved in the (strict) metastable range 2p-1<q\leq3(p-1) under fairly mild conditions by making use of the Hopf invariant techniques recently developed by the authors in their study of the sectional category of arbitrary maps.
