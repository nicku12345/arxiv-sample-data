The Kervaire Problem is an unsolved problem in Stable Homotopy Theory. The first interesting example is in dimension 30. There exists a closed stably-parallelizable manifold \tilde{M}^{30} with Arf-Kervaire invariant 1. It is unknown, if such a manifold exists in dimension 126? The goal of the paper is to recall the construction of the manifold M^{30} and investigate its properties.
