A 1-truncated compact Lie group is any extension of a finite group by a torus. In this note we compute the homotopy types of Map_*(BG,BH), Map(BG,BH), and Map(EG, B_GH)^G for compact Lie groups G and H with H 1-truncated, showing that they are computed entirely in terms of spaces of homomorphisms from G to H. These results generalize the well-known case when H is finite, and the case of H compact abelian due to Lashof, May, and Segal.
