We present a calculation, which shows how the moduli of complex analytic elliptic curves arises naturally from the Borel cohomology of an extended moduli space of U(1)-bundles on a torus. Furthermore, we show how the analogous calculation, applied to a moduli space of principal bundles for a K(\mathbb{Z},2) central extension of U(1)^d give rise to Looijenga line bundles. We then speculate on the relation of these calculations to the construction of complex analytic equivariant elliptic cohomology.
