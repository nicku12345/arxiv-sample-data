Let a torus T act smoothly on a compact smooth manifold M. If the rational equivariant cohomology H^*_T(M) is a free H^*_T(pt)-module, then according to the Chang-Skjelbred Lemma, it can be determined by the 1-skeleton consisting of the T-fixed points and 1-dimensional T-orbits of M. When M is an even-dimensional, orientable manifold with 2-dimensional 1-skeleton, Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson gave a graphic description of the equivariant cohomology. In this paper, first we revisit the even-dimensional GKM theory and introduce a notion of GKM covering, then we consider the case when M is an odd-dimensional, possibly non-orientable manifold with 3-dimensional 1-skeleton, and give a graphic description of its equivariant cohomology.
