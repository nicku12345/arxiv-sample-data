This sketch argues that work of Hesselholt on the topological Hochschild homology of \Cp extends, using work of Scholze and others, to define complex orientations for a version of topological Hochschild homology for rings of integers in a natural class of generalized cyclotomic perfectoid fields; and that the resulting spectra provide geometrically interesting targets for analogs of the Chern character, defined for certain integral lifts of the extraordinary K-functors of chromatic homotopy theory.
