At the prime 2, Behrens, Hill, Hopkins and Mahowald showed M_2(1,4) admits 32-periodic v_2-self-map and more recently authors joint with Mahowald showed A_1 also admits 32-periodic v_2-self-map. This leads to the question, whether there exists a finite 2-local complex with periodicity less than 32. This paper will answer the question by producing a class of finite 2-local spectra \widetilde{\mathcal{Z}} all of which admit 1-periodic v_2-self-map.
