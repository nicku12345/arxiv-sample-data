The Nerve Theorem relates the topological type of a suitably nice space with the nerve of a good cover of that space. It has many variants, such as to consider acyclic covers and numerous applications in topology including applied and computational topology. The goal of this paper is to relax the notion of a good cover to an approximately good cover, or more precisely, we introduce the notion of an \varepsilon-acyclic cover. We use persistent homology to make this rigorous and prove tight bounds between the persistent homology of a space endowed with a function and the persistent homology of the nerve of an \varepsilon-acyclic cover of the space. Using the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence, we upper bound how local non-acyclicity can affect the global homology. To prove the best possible bound we must introduce special cases of interleavings between persistence modules called left and right interleavings. Finally, we provide examples which achieve the bound proving the lower bound and tightness of the result.
