Given a strong homotopy pushout cube of spaces A, we measure how far it is from also being a homotopy pullback cube. Explicitly, letting P be the homotopy colimit of the diagram obtained from A by forgetting the initial vertex A_\varnothing, we study the homotopy fibre of the double suspension of the comparison map A_\varnothing \to P. This difference is expressible in terms of the homotopy fibres of the original maps in A.
