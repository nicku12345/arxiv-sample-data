The main aim of this paper is to explore the ideas of persistent homology and extended persistent homology, and their stability theorems, using ideas from [Bubenik and Scott, 2014; Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Harer, 2007; and Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Harer, 2009], as well as other sources. The secondary aim is to explore the homology (and cohomology) of non-orientable surfaces, using the Klein bottle as an example. We also use the Klein bottle as an example for the computation of (extended) persistent homology, referring to it throughout the paper.
