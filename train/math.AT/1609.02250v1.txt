Let P_k:= \mathbb{F}_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k] be the polynomial algebra in k variables with the degree of each x_i being 1, regarded as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra \mathcal{A}, and let GL_k be the general linear group over the prime field \mathbb{F}_2 which acts naturally on P_k. We study the hit problem, set up by Frank Peterson, of finding a minimal set of generators for the polynomial algebra P_k as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, \mathcal{A}. These results are used to study the Singer algebraic transfer which is a homomorphism from the homology of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, \mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal{A}}_{k, k+n}(\mathbb{F}_2, \mathbb{F}_2), to the subspace of \mathbb{F}_2\otimes_{\mathcal{A}}P_k consisting of all the GL_k-invariant classes of degree n. In this paper, we explicitly compute the hit problem for k = 5 and the degree 7.2^s-5 with s an arbitrary positive integer. Using this result, we show that Singer's conjecture for the algebraic transfer is true in the case k=5 and the above degree.
