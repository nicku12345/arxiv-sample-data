Let G be a simply-connected simple compact Lie group and let M be an orientable smooth closed 4-manifold. In this paper we calculate the homotopy type of the suspension of M and the homotopy types of the gauge groups of principal G-bundles over M when \pi_1(M) is: (1)~\mathbb{Z}^{*m}, (2)~\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}, or (3)~\mathbb{Z}^{*m}*(*^n_{j=1}\mathbb{Z}/p_j^{r_j}\mathbb{Z}), where p and the p_j's are odd primes.
