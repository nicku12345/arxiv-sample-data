A classical theorem of Adams, Harris, and Switzer states that the 0th grading of complex K-theory cooperations, KU_0ku is isomorphic to the space of numerical polynomials. The space of numerical polynomials has a basis provided by the binomial coefficient polynomials, which gives a basis of KU_0ku. In this paper, we produce a new p-local basis for KU_0ku_{(p)} using the Adams splitting. This basis is established by using well known formulas for the Hazewinkel generators. For p=2, we show that this new basis coincides with the classical basis modulo higher Adams filtration.
