The s-th higher topological complexity of a space X, TC_s(X), can be estimated from above by homotopical methods, and from below by homological methods. We give a thorough analysis of the gap between such estimates when X=RP^m, the real projective space of dimension m. In particular, we describe a number r(m), which depends on the structure of zeros and ones in the binary expansion of m, and with the property that TC_s(RP^m) is given by sm with an error of at most one provided s \geq r(m) and m \not\equiv 3 \bmod 4 (the error vanishes for even m). The latter fact appears to be closely related to the estimation of the Euclidean immersion dimension of RP^m. We illustrate the phenomenon in the case m=3 \cdot 2^a.
