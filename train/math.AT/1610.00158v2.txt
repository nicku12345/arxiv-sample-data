We provide a topological duality resolution for the spectrum E_2^{h\mathbb{S}_2^1}, which itself can be used to build the K(2)-local sphere. The resolution is built from spectra of the form E_2^{hF} where E_2 is the Morava spectrum for the formal group of a supersingular curve at the prime 2 and F is a finite subgroup of the automorphisms of that formal group. The results are in complete analogy with the resolutions of Goerss, Henn, Mahowald, and Rezk at the prime 3, but the methods are of necessity very different. As in the prime 3 case, the main difficulty is in identifying the top fiber; to do this, we make calculations using Henn's centralizer resolution.
