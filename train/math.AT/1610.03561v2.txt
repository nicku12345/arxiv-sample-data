We investigate the particular properties of the stable category of modules over a finite dimensional cocommutative graded connected Hopf algebra A, via tensor-triangulated geometry. This study requires some mild conditions on the Hopf algebra A under consideration (satisfied for example by all finite sub-Hopf-algebras of the modulo 2 Steenrod algebra). In particular, we study some particular covers of its spectrum of prime ideals \mathrm{Spc}(A), which are related to Margolis' Work.   We then exploit the existence of Margolis' Postnikov towers in this situation to show that the localization at an open subset U of \mathrm{Spc}(A), for various U, assembles in an \infty-stack.   Finally, we turn to applications in the study of Picard groups of Hopf algebras and localizations in the stable categories of modules.
