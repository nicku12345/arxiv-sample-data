It is well known that the two-parametric Todd genus and elliptic functions of level d define n-multiplicative Hirzebruch genera, if d divides n+1. Both these cases are particular cases of Krichever genera defined by the Baker--Akhiezer functions. In this work the inverse problem is solved. Namely, it is proved that only these families of functions define n-multiplicative Hirzebruch genera among all the Krichever genera for all n.
