We prove several new theorems regarding first homology. Some dichotomies for first homology of Peano continua are presented, as well as a notion of strong abelianization for arbitrary path connected metric spaces. We also show that the fundamental group of the Hawaiian earring has Borel subgroups of almost all multiplicative and additive types.
