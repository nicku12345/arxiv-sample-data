Dochtermann introduced the loop space construction of a based graph (G,v) whose basepoint is a looped vertex. He showed that the complex C(\Omega(G,v)) is homotopy equivalent to the loop space \Omega(C(G),v) of C(G). Here we write C(G) to mean the clique complex of the maximal reflexive subgraph of G. In this paper, we consider its bigraph version. A bigraph is a graph equipped with its 2-coloring. We introduce the loop space construction \Omega_{/K_2}(X,x) of a based bigraph (X,x). This is a graph such that C(\Omega_{/K_2}(X,x)) is homotopy equivalent to the loop space of the box complex B_{/K_2}(X) of the bigraph. As a result, we have alternative proofs of some results of Matsushita and Schultz.
