We study the category of Reedy diagrams in a \mm-model category. Explicitly, we show that if K is a small category, V is a closed symmetric monoidal category and C is a closed V-module, then the diagram category V^K is a closed symmetric monoidal category and the diagram category C^K is a closed V^K-module. We then prove that if further K is a Reedy category, V is a monoidal model category and C is a V-model category, then with the Reedy model category structures, V^K is a monoidal model category and C^K is a \mm^K-model category provided that either the unit 1 of V is cofibrant or V is cofibrantly generated.
