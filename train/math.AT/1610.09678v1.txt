Let X be a paracompact space, let G be a finite group acting freely on X and let H a cyclic subgroup of G of prime order p. Let f:X\rightarrow M be a continuous map where M is a connected m-manifold (orientable if p>2) and f^* (V_k) = 0, for k\geq 1, where V_k are the Wu classes of M. Suppose that {\rm{ind}}\, X\geq n> (|G|-r)m, where r=\frac{|G|}{p}. In this work, we estimate the cohomological dimension of the set A(f,H,G) of (H,G)-coincidence points of f. Also, we estimate the index of a (H, G)-coincidence set in the case that H is a p-torus subgroup of a particular group G and as application we prove a topological Tverberg type theorem for any natural number r. Such result is a weak version of the famous topological Tverberg conjecture, which was proved recently, fail for all r that are not prime powers. Moreover, we obtain a generalized Van Kampen-Flores type theorem for any natural number r.
