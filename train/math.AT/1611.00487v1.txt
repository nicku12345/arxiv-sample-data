K. Borsuk in 1979, in the Topological Conference in Moscow, introduced the concept of the capacity of a compactum and raised some interesting questions about it. In this paper, during computing the capacity of wedge sum of finitely many spheres of different dimensions and the complex projective plane, we give a negative answer to a question of Borsuk whether the capacity of a compactum determined by its homology properties.
