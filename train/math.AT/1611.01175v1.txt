Recent work of Chen He has determined through GKM methods the Borel equivariant cohomology with rational coefficients of the isotropy action on a real Grassmannian and an real oriented Grassmannian through GKM methods. In this expository note, we propound a less involved approach, due essentially to Vitali Kapovitch, to computing equivariant cohomology rings H^*_K(G/H) for G,K,H connected Lie groups, and apply it to recover the equivariant cohomology of the Grassmannians. The bulk is setup and commentary; once one believes in the model, the proof itself is under a page.
