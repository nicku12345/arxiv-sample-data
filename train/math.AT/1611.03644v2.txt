We study commutative complex K-theory, a generalised cohomology theory built from spaces of ordered commuting tuples in the unitary groups. We show that the spectrum for commutative complex K-theory is stably equivalent to the ku-group ring of BU(1) and thus obtain a splitting of its representing space B_{com}U as a product of all the terms in the Whitehead tower for BU, B_{com}U\simeq BU\times BU\langle 4\rangle \times BU\langle 6\rangle \times \dots . As a consequence of the spectrum level identification we obtain the ring of coefficients for this theory. Using the rational Hopf ring for B_{com}U we describe the relationship of our results with a previous computation of the rational cohomology algebra of B_{com}U. This gives an essentially complete description of the space B_{com}U introduced by A. Adem and J. G\'omez.
