We consider the structure of the Goldman Lie algebra for the closed torus, and show that it is finitely generated over the rationals. We also consider other traditional Lie algebra structures and determine that the Goldman Lie algebra for the torus is not nilpotent or solvable, and we compute the derived Lie algebra.
