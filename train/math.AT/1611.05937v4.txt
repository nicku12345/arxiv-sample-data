We describe the connected components of the space \text{Hom}(\Gamma,SU(2)) of homomorphisms for a discrete nilpotent group \Gamma. The connected components arising from homomorphisms with non-abelian image turn out to be homeomorphic to \mathbb{RP}^3. We give explicit calculations when \Gamma is a finitely generated free nilpotent group. In the second part of the paper we study the filtration B_{\text{com}}SU(2) = B(2,SU(2))\subset\cdots \subset B(q,SU(2))\subset\cdots of the classifying space BSU(2) (introduced by Adem, Cohen and Torres-Giese), showing that for every q\geq2, the inclusions induce a homology isomorphism with coefficients over a ring in which 2 is invertible. Most of the computations are done for SO(3) and U(2) as well.
