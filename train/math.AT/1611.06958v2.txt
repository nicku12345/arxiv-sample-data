We study some power operations for ordinary C_2-equivariant homology with coefficients in the constant Mackey functor \underline{\mathbb{F}}_2. In addition to a few foundational results, we calculate the action of these power operations on a C_2-equivariant dual Steenrod algebra. As an application, we give a cellular construction of the C_2 equivariant Brown-Peterson spectrum \text{BP}\mathbf{R} and deduce its slice tower.
