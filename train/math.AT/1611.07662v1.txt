In this article we show that there are at most two integers up to 2(n-k), which can occur as the degrees of nonzero Stiefel-Whitney classes of vector bundles over the Stiefel manifold V_k(\mathbb{R}^n). In the case when n> k(k+4)/4, we show that if w_{2^q}(\xi) is the first nonzero Stiefel-Whitney class of a vector bundle \xi over V_k(\mathbb{R}^n) then w_t(\xi) is zero if t is not a multiple of 2^q. In addition, we give relations among Stiefel-Whitney classes whose degrees are multiples of 2^q.
