Chas and Sullivan introduced string homology, which is the equivariant homology of the loop space with the S^1 action on loops by rotation. Craig Westerland computed the string homology for spheres with coefficients in \mathbb{Z} /2\mathbb{Z} and Somnath Basu computed the string homology and string bracket for spheres over rational coefficients and found that the bracket is trivial in his dissertation. In this paper, we compute string homology and the string bracket for spheres with integer coefficients, treating the odd- and even-dimensional cases separately. We use the Gysin sequence and Leray-Serre spectral sequence for our computations. We find that over the integers, the string Lie algebra bracket structure is not always zero as Basu found. The string bracket turns out to be non-zero on torsion elements coming from string homology.
