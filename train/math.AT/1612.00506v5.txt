Let \mathbf{B}PU_{n} be the classifying space of PU_n, the projective unitary group of order n, for n>1. We use the Serre spectral sequence associated to a fiber sequence \mathbf{B}U_n\rightarrow\mathbf{B}PU_n\rightarrow K(\mathbb{Z},3) to determine the ring structure of H^{*}(\mathbf{B}PU_{n}; \mathbb{Z}) up to degree 10, as well as a family of distinguished elements of H^{2p+2}(\mathbf{B}PU_{n}; \mathbb{Z}), for each prime divisor p of n. We also study the primitive elements of H^*(\mathbf{B}U_n;\mathbb{Z}) as a comodule over H^*(K(\mathbb{Z},2);\mathbb{Z}), where the comodule structure is given by an action of K(\mathbb{Z},2)\simeq\mathbf{B}S^1 on BU_n corresponding to the action of taking the tensor product of a complex line bundle and an n dimensional complex vector bundle.
