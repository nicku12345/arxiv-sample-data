Quasi-elliptic cohomology is a variant of Tate K-theory. It is the orbifold K-theory of a space of constant loops. For global quotient orbifolds, it can be expressed in terms of equivariant K-theories. In this paper we show how this theory is equipped with power operations. We also prove that the Tate K-theory of symmetric groups modulo a certain transfer ideal classify the finite subgroups of the Tate curve.
