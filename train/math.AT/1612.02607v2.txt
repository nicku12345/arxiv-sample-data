Associated to a presentable \infty-category \mathcal{C} and an object X \in \mathcal{C} is the tangent \infty-category \mathcal{T}_X\mathcal{C}, consisting of parameterized spectrum objects over X. This gives rise to a cohomology theory, called Quillen cohomology, whose category of coefficients is \mathcal{T}_X\mathcal{C}. When \mathcal{C} consists of algebras over a nice \infty-operad in a stable \infty-category, \mathcal{T}_X\mathcal{C} is equivalent to the \infty-category of operadic modules, by work of Basterra--Mandell, Schwede and Lurie. In this paper we develop the model-categorical counterpart of this identification and extend it to the case of algebras over an enriched operad, taking values in a model category which is not necessarily stable. This extended comparison can be used, for example, to identify the cotangent complex of enriched categories, an application we take up in a subsequent paper.
