We introduce general methods to analyse the Goodwillie tower of the identity functor on a wedge X \vee Y of spaces (using the Hilton-Milnor theorem) and on the cofibre \mathrm{cof}(f) of a map f: X \rightarrow Y. We deduce some consequences for v_n-periodic homotopy groups: whereas the Goodwillie tower is finite and converges in periodic homotopy when evaluated on spheres (Arone-Mahowald), we show that neither of these statements remains true for wedges and Moore spaces.
