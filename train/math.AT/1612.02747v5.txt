Recently, Cohen and Vandembroucq proved that the reduced topological complexity of the Klein bottle is 4. Simultaneously and independently, we announced a proof of the same result. Mistakes were found in our argument, which was quite different than theirs. After correcting these, we found that our description of the obstruction class agreed with theirs. Our approach to showing that this obstruction is nonzero failed to do so, while theirs did not fail. Here we discuss our approach, which deals more directly with the simplicial structure of the Klein bottle.
