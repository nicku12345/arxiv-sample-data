Recently, the homology and cohomology of non-k-overlapping discs, or, equivalently, no k-equal subspaces of Euclidean space, were calculated by Dobrinskaya and Turchin. We calculate the homology and cohomology of two classes of more general spaces: decreasing polychromatic configuration spaces and bicolored configuration spaces. Instead of all points behaving similarly, we allow for varying behavior between points.
