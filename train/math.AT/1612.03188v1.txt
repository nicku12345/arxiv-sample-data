Let M be a closed K-contact (2n+1)-manifold equipped with a quasi-regular K-contact structure. Rukimbira proved that the Reeb vector field \xi of this structure has at least n+1 closed characteristics. We note that \xi has at least 2n+1 closed characteristics provided that the space of leaves of the foliation determined by \xi is symplectically aspherical.
