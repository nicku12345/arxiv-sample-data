In this paper we study quasi-categories of comodules over coalgebras in a stable homotopy theory. We show that the quasi-category of comodules over the coalgebra associated to a Landweber exact S-algebra depends only on the height of the associated formal group. We also show that the quasi-category of E(n)-local spectra is equivalent to the quasi-category of comodules over the coalgebra A\otimes A for any Landweber exact S_(p)-algebra A of height n at a prime p. Furthermore, we show that the category of module objects over a discrete model of the Morava E-theory spectrum in the K(n)-local discrete symmetric G_n-spectra is a model of the K(n)-local category, where G_n is the extended Morava stabilizer group.
