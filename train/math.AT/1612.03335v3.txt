K. Borsuk in 1979, in the Topological Conference in Moscow, introduced the concept of capacity and depth of a compactum. In this paper, we compute the capacity and depth of compact surfaces. We show that the capacity and depth of every compact orientable surface of genus g\geq 0 is equal to g+2. Also, we prove that the capacity and depth of a compact non-orientable surface of genus g>0 is [\frac{g}{2}]+2.
