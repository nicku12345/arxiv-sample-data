We study a generalization of the classical Riemannian Tonnetz to N-tone equally tempered scales (for all N) and arbitrary triads. We classify all the spaces that result. The torus turns out to be the most common possibility, especially as N grows. Other spaces include 2-simplices, tetrahedra boundaries, and the harmonic strip (in both its cylinder and Mobius band variants). The final and most exotic space we find is something we call a `circle of tetrahedra boundaries'. These are the Tonnetze for spaces of triads which contain a tritone. They are closely related to Peck's Klein bottle Tonnetz.
