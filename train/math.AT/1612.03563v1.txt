F\'elix and Thomas extended the loop products and coproducts to simply-connected Gorenstein spaces. We explicitly describe these operations with rational coefficients in terms of Sullivan models. Moreover, by this description, we prove some results on triviality of these operations. They include a variant of the result of Tamanoi, and generalizations of that of F\'elix and Thomas and that of Naito.
