Given an \infty-category with a set of weak equivalences which is stable under pullback, we show that the mapping spaces of the corresponding localization can be described as group completions of \infty-categories of spans. Furthermore, we show how these \infty-categories of spans are the mapping objects of an (\infty, 2)-category, which yields a Segal space model for the localization after a Kan fibrant replacement.
