We prove homological stability for both general linear groups of modules over a ring with finite stable rank and unitary groups of quadratic modules over a ring with finite unitary stable rank. In particular, we do not assume the modules and quadratic modules to be well-behaved in any sense: for example, the quadratic form may be singular. This extends results by van der Kallen and Mirzaii--van der Kallen respectively. Combining these results with the machinery introduced by Galatius--Randal-Williams to prove homological stability for moduli spaces of simply-connected manifolds of dimension 2n > 4, we get an extension of their result to the case of virtually polycyclic fundamental groups.
