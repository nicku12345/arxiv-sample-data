For positive integers m,n, d\geq 1 with (m,n)\not= (1,1) and a field \Bbb F with its algebraic closure \overline{\Bbb F}, let \text{Poly}^{d,m}_n(\Bbb F) denote the space of all m-tuples (f_1(z),\cdots ,f_m(z))\in \Bbb F [z] of monic polynomials of the same degree d such that polynomials f_1(z),\cdots ,f_m(z) have no common root in \overline{\Bbb F} of multiplicity \geq n. These spaces were defined by Farb and Wolfson in \cite{FW} as generalizations of spaces first studied by Arnold, Vassiliev, Segal and others in different contexts. In \cite{FW} they obtained algebraic geometrical and arithmetic results about the topology of these spaces. In this paper we investigate the homotopy type of these spaces for the case \Bbb F =\mathbb{C}. Our results generalize those of \cite{FW} for \Bbb F =\Bbb C and also results of G. Segal \cite{Se}, V. Vassiliev \cite{Va} and F.Cohen-R.Cohen-B.Mann-R.Milgram \cite{CCMM} for m\geq 2 and n\geq 2.
