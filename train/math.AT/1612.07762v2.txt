In this paper we will define an invariant mc_{\infty}(f) of maps f:X \rightarrow Y_{\mathbb{Q}} between a finite CW-complex and a rational space Y_{\mathbb{Q}}. We prove that this invariant is complete, i.e. mc_{\infty}(f)=mc_{\infty}(g) if an only if f and g are homotopic. We will also construct an L_{\infty}-model for the based mapping space Map_*(X,Y_{\mathbb{Q}}) from a C_{\infty}-coalgebra and an L_{\infty}-algebra.
