The paper surveys topological problems relevant to the motion planning problem of robotics and includes some new results and constructions. First we analyse the notion of topological complexity of configuration spaces which is responsible for discontinuities in algorithms for robot navigation. Then we present explicit motion planning algorithms for coordinated collision free control of many particles moving in Euclidean spaces or on graphs. These algorithms are optimal in the sense that they have minimal number of regions of continuity. Moreover, we describe in full detail the topology of configuration spaces of two particles on a tree and use it to construct some top-dimensional cohomology classes in configuration spaces of n particles on a tree.
