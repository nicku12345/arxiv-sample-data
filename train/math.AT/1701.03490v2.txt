We consider for two based graphs G and H the sequence of graphs G_k given by the wedge sum of G and k copies of H. These graphs have an action of the symmetric group \Sigma_k by permuting the H-summands. We show that the sequence of representations of the symmetric group H_q(\mathrm{Conf}_n(G_\bullet); \mathbf{Q}), the homology of the ordered configuration space of these spaces, is representation stable in the sense of Church and Farb. In the case where G and H are trees, we provide a similar result for glueing along arbitrary subtrees instead of the base point. Furthermore, we show that stabilization alway holds for q = 1.
