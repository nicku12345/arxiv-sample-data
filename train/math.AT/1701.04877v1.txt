Consider the Tate twist \tau \in H^{0,1}(S^{0,0}) in the mod 2 cohomology of the motivic sphere. After 2-completion, the motivic Adams spectral sequence realizes this element as a map \tau \colon S^{0,-1} \to S^{0,0}, with cofiber C\tau. We show that this motivic 2-cell complex can be endowed with a unique E_{\infty} ring structure. Moreover, this promotes the known isomorphism \pi_{\ast,\ast} C\tau \cong \mathrm{Ext}^{\ast,\ast}_{BP_{\ast}BP}(BP_{\ast},BP_{\ast}) to an isomorphism of rings which also preserves higher products.   We then consider the closed symmetric monoidal category ({ }_{C\tau}\textbf{Mod}, - \wedge_{C\tau} -) which lives in the kernel of Betti realization. Given a motivic spectrum X, the C\tau-induced spectrum X \wedge C\tau is usually better behaved and easier to understand than X itself. We specifically illustrate this concept in the examples of the mod 2 Eilenberg-Maclane spectrum H\mathbb{F}_2, the mod 2 Moore spectrum S^{0,0}/2 and the connective hermitian K-theory spectrum kq.
