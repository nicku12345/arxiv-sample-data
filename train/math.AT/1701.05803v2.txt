We prove a necessary condition for the existence of the A_p-structure on {\rm mod}~p spaces, and also derive a simple proof for the finiteness of the number of {\rm mod}~p A_p-spaces of given rank. As a direct application, we compute a list of possible types of rank 3 {\rm mod}~3 homotopy associative H-spaces.
