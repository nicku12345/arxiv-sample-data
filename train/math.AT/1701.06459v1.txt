We study the covariant model structure on dendroidal spaces and establish direct relations to the homotopy theory of algebras over a simplicial operad as well as to the homotopy theory of special \Gamma-spaces. As an important tool in the latter comparison, we present a sharpening of the classical Barratt-Priddy-Quillen theorem.
