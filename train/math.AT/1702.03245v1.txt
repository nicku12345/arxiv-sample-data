The set of Bousfield classes has some important subsets such as the distributive lattice \mathbf{DL} of all classes \langle E\rangle which are smash idempotent and the complete Boolean algebra \mathbf{cBA} of closed classes. We provide examples of spectra that are in \mathbf{DL}, but not in \mathbf{cBA}; in particular, for every prime p, the Bousfield class of the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum \langle H\mathbb{F}_p\rangle\in\mathbf{DL}{\setminus}\mathbf{cBA}.
