In this paper, we study h-fibrations, a weak homotopical version of fibrations which have weak covering homotopy property. We present some homotopical analogue of the notions related to fibrations and characterize h-fibrations using them. Then we construct some new categories by h-fibrations and deduce some results in these categories such as the existence of products and coproducts.
