In the preceding paper, we have constructed a compactly generated model structure on the category \dcal of diffeological spaces together with the adjoint pairs |\ |_\dcal : \scal \rightleftarrows \dcal : S^\dcal and \tilde{\cdot} : \dcal \rightleftarrows \ccal^0 : R, where \scal and \ccal^0 denote the category of simplicial sets and that of arc-generated spaces, respectively. In this paper, we show that (|\ |_\dcal, S^\dcal) and (\tilde{\cdot}, R) are pairs of Quillen equivalences. Since our approach developed in the preceding paper applies to the category \ccal h of Chen spaces as well, \ccal h is also a compactly generated model category. We also show that the adjoint pair \mathfrak{S}_\mathfrak{o} : \ccal h \rightleftarrows \dcal : \mathfrak{Ch}^\sharp introduced by Stacey is a pair of Quillen equivalences.
