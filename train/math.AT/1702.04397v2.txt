We show an alternative construction of the cosimplicial free complete diferential graded Lie algebra \mathfrak{L}_\bullet=\widehat{\mathbb{L}}(s^{-1}\Delta^\bullet) based on a new Lie bracket formulae for Lie polynomials on a general tensor algebra. Based on it,we prove that for any complete differential graded Lie algebra L, its geometrical realization \langle L\rangle=\text{Hom}_{\text{cdgl}}(\mathfrak{L}_\bullet,L) is isomorphic to its nerve \gamma_\bullet(L), a deformation retract of the Getzler-Hinich realization \text{MC}(\mathscr{A}_\bullet\widehat{\otimes} L).
