In this paper we establish a formula for computing d_2(sq^i(x)) where x is a permanent cycle in the C_2-equivariant Adams spectral sequence or the motivic Adams spectral sequence over Spec(\mathbb{R}).   This requires establishing that the Adams towers have an H_{\infty}-structure as well as determining the attaching maps for C_2-equivariant projective spaces.   The attaching maps of C_2-equivariant projective spaces can then be used to determine the coefficients of differentials in both the equivariant and motivic case.   At the end some sample computations are given.
