Let \Gamma = SL 3 (Z[ 1 2 , i]), let X be any mod-2 acyclic \Gamma-CW complex on which \Gamma acts with finite stabilizers and let Xs be the 2-singular locus of X. We calculate the mod-2 cohomology of the Borel constructon of Xs with respect to the action of \Gamma. This cohomology coincides with the mod-2 cohomology of \Gamma in cohomological degrees bigger than 8 and the result is compatible with a conjecture of Quillen which predicts the strucure of the cohomology ring H * (\Gamma; Z/2).
