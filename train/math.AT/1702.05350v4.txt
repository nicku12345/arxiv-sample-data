The aim of this paper is to present a method for computation of persistent homology that performs well at large filtration values. To this end we introduce the concept of filtered covers. We show that the persistent homology of a bounded metric space obtained from the \v{C}ech complex is the persistent homology of the filtered nerve of the filtered \v{C}ech cover. Given a parameter \delta with 0 < \delta \le 1 we introduce the concept of a \delta-filtered cover and show that its filtered nerve is interleaved with the \v{C}ech complex. Finally, we introduce a particular \delta-filtered cover, the divisive cover. The special feature of the divisive cover is that it is constructed top-down. If we disregard fine scale structure and X is a finite subspace of euclidean space, then we obtain a filtered simplicial complex whose size is bounded by an upper bound independent of the cardinality of X. The time needed to compute this filtered simplicial complex depends linearly on the cardinality of X.
