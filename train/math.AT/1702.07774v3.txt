The work of Hausel proves that the Bia\l{}ynicki-Birula stratification of the moduli space of rank two Higgs bundles coincides with its Shatz stratification. He uses that to estimate some homotopy groups of the moduli space of k-Higgs bundles of rank two. Unfortunately, those two stratifications do not coincide in general. Here, the objective is to present a different proof of the stabilization of the homotopy groups of \mathcal{M}^k(2,d), and generalize it to \mathcal{M}^k(3,d), the moduli spaces of k-Higgs bundles of degree d, and ranks two and three respectively, using the results from the works of Hausel and Thaddeus, among other tools.
