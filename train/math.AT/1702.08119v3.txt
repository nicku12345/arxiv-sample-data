We extend the Cisinski-Moerdijk-Weiss theory of \infty-operads to the equivariant setting to obtain a notion of G-\infty-operads that encode "equivariant operads with norm maps" up to homotopy. At the root of this work is the identification of a suitable category of G-trees together with a notion of G-inner horns capable of encoding the compositions of norm maps. Additionally, we follow Blumberg and Hill by constructing suitable variants associated to each of the indexing systems featured in their work.
