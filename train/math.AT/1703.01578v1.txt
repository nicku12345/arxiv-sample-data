In this paper we show that the nth quasitopological homotopy group of a topological space is isomorphic to (n-1)th quasitopological homotopy group of its loop space and by this fact we obtain some results about quasitopological homotopy groups. Finally, using the long exact sequence of a based pair and a fibration in qTop introduced by Brazas in 2013, we obtain some results in this field.
