On the complement X= {\mathbb C}^2 - \bigcup_{i=1}^n L_i to a central plane line arrangement \bigcup_{i=1}^n L_i \subset {\mathbb C}^2, a locally constant sheaf of complex vector spaces \mathcal L_a is associated to any multi-index a \in {\mathbb C}^n. Using the description of MacPherson and Vilonen of the category of perverse sheaves (\cite{MV2} and \cite {MV3}) we obtain a criterion for the irreducibility and number of decomposition factors of the direct image Rj_* \mathcal L_a as a perverse sheaf, where j: X \rightarrow {\mathbb C}^2 is the canonical inclusion.
