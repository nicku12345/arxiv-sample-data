In this paper we explain how to convert discrete invariants into stable ones via what we call hierarchical stabilization. We illustrate this process by constructing stable invariants for multi parameter persistence modules with respect to so called simple noise systems. For one parameter we recover the standard bar code information. For more than one parameter we prove that the constructed invariants are in general NP-hard to calculate.
