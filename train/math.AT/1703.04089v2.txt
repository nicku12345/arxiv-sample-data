The current work is motivated by the papers [B_3], [B_6], [Be], [Be-Tu]. In particular, using Theorem 3.7 of [B_3] and methods developed in this paper, the spectral and strong homology groups of continuous maps were defined and studied [B_6], [Be], [Be-Tu]. In this paper we will show that strong homology groups of continuous maps are a homology type functor, which is a strong shape invariant and has the semi-continuous property. We will formulate the new axioms and the conjunction on the uniqueness of the constructed functor.
