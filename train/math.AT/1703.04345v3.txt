Let D(M,N) be the set of integers that can be realized as the degree of a map between two closed connected orientable manifolds M and N of the same dimension. For closed 3-manifolds with S^3-geometry M and N, every such degree deg f\equiv \overline{deg}\psi (|\pi_1(N)|) where 0\le \overline{deg}\psi <|\pi_1(N)| and \overline{deg}\psi only depends on the induced homomorphism \psi=f_{\pi} on the fundamental group. In this paper, we calculate explicitly the set \{\overline{deg}\psi\} when \psi is surjective and then we show how to determine \overline{deg}(\psi) for arbitrary homomorphisms. This leads to the determination of the set D(M,N).
