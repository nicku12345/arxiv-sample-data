On the category of compact metric spaces an exact homology theory was defined and its relation to the Vietoris homology theory was studied by N. Steenrod [S]. In particular, the homomorphism from the Steenrod homology groups to the Vietoris homology groups was defined and it was shown that the kernel of the given homomorphism are homological groups, which was called weak homology groups [S], [E]. The Steenrod homology theory on the category of compact metric pairs was axiomatically described by J.Milnor. In [Mil] the uniqueness theorem is proved using the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms and as well as relative homeomorphism and clusres axioms. J. Milnor constructed the homology theory on the category Top^2_C of compact Hausdorff pairs and proved that on the given category it satisfies nine axioms - the Eilenberg-Steenrod, relative homeomorphis and cluster axioms (see theorem 5 in [Mil]). Besides, using the construction of weak homology theory, J.Milnor proved that constructed homology theory satisfies partial continuity property on the subcategory Top^2_{CM} (see theorem 4 in [Mil]) and the universal coefficient formula on the category Top^2_C (see Lemma 5 in [Mil]). On the category of compact Hausdorff pairs, different axiomatic systems were proposed by N. Berikashvili [B1], [B2], H.Inasaridze and L. Mdzinarishvili [IM], L. Mdzinarishvili [M] and H.Inasaridze [I], but there was not studied any connection between them. The paper studies this very problem. In particular, in the paper it is proved that any homology theory in Inasaridze sense is the homology theory in the Berikashvili sense, which itself is the homology theory in the Mdzinarishvili sense. On the other hand, it is shown that if a homology theory in the Mdzinarishvili sense is exact functor of the second argument, then it is the homology in the Inasaridze sense.
