In the paper the \v{C}ech border homology and cohomology groups of closed pairs of normal spaces are constructed and investigated. These groups give intrinsic characterizations of \v{C}ech homology and cohomology groups based on finite open coverings, homological and cohomological coefficients of cyclicity, small and large cohomological dimensions of remainders of Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications of metrizable spaces.
