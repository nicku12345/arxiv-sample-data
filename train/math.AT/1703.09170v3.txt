The Dold-Thom theorem states that for a sufficiently nice topological space, M, there is an isomorphism between the homotopy groups of the infinite symmetric product of M and the homology groups of M itself. The crux of most known proofs of this is to check that a certain map is a quasi-fibration. It is our goal to present a more direct proof of the Dold-Thom theorem which does appeal to any such fact. The heart of our proof lies in identification of the infinite symmetric product as an instance of factorization homology.
