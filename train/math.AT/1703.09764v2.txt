Pursuing the notions of ambidexterity and higher semiadditivity as developed by Hopkins and Lurie, we prove that the span \infty-category of m-finite spaces is the free m-semiadditive \infty-category generated by a single object. Passing to presentable \infty-categories we obtain a description of the free presentable m-semiadditive \infty-category in terms of a new notion of m-commutative monoids, which can be described as spaces in which families of points parameterized by m-finite spaces can be coherently summed. Such an abstract summation procedure can be used to give a formal \infty-categorical definition of the finite path integral described by Freed, Hopkins, Lurie and Teleman in the context of 1-dimensional topological field theories.
