In the paper we construct and develop a fiber strong shape theory for arbitrary spaces over fixed metrizable space \Bo. Our approach is based on the method of Marde\v{s}i\'{c}-Lisica and instead of resolutions, introduced by Marde\v{s}i\'{c}, their fiber preserving analogues are used. The fiber strong shape theory yields the classification of spaces over \Bo which is coarser than the classification of spaces over \Bo induced by fiber homotopy theory, but is finer than the classification of spaces over \Bo given by usual fiber shape theory.
