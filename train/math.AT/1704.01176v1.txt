We study quotients of mapping class groups (\Gamma_{g,1}) of oriented surfaces with one boundary component by terms of their Johnson filtrations, and we show that the homology of these quotients with suitable systems of twisted coefficients stabilises as the genus of the surface goes to infinity. We also compute the stable (co)homology with constant rational coefficients for one family of such quotients.
