Given a selfmap f:X\to X on a compact connected polyhedron X, H. Schirmer gave necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonempty closed subset A to be the fixed point set of a map in the homotopy class of f. R. Brown and C. Soderlund extended Schirmer's result to the category of fiber bundles and fiber-preserving maps. The objective of this paper is to prove an equivariant analogue of Brown-Soderlund theorem result in the category of G-spaces and G-maps where G is a finite group.
