Let f,g:X\to Y be maps from a compact infra-nilmanifold X to a compact nilmanifold Y with \dim X\ge \dim Y. In this note, we show that a certain Wecken type property holds, i.e., if the Nielsen number N(f,g) vanishes then f and g are deformable to be coincidence free. We also show that if X is a connected finite complex X and the Reidemeister coincidence number R(f,g)=\infty then f\sim f' so that C(f',g)=\{x\in X \mid f'(x)=g(x)\} is empty.
