Suppose \alpha is a nonzero cardinal number, \mathcal I is an ideal on arc connected topological space X, and {\mathfrak P}_{\mathcal I}^\alpha(X) is the subgroup of \pi_1(X) (the first fundamental group of X) generated by homotopy classes of \alpha\frac{\mathcal I}{}loops. The main aim of this text is to study {\mathfrak P}_{\mathcal I}^\alpha(X)s and compare them. Most interest is in \alpha\in\{\omega,c\} and \mathcal I\in\{\mathcal P_{fin}(X),\{\varnothing\}\}, where \mathcal P_{fin}(X) denotes the collection of all finite subsets of X. We denote {\mathfrak P}_{\{\varnothing\}}^\alpha(X) with {\mathfrak P}^\alpha(X). We prove the following statements:   \bullet for arc connected topological spaces X and Y if {\mathfrak P}^\alpha(X) is isomorphic to {\mathfrak P}^\alpha(Y) for all infinite cardinal number \alpha, then \pi_1(X) is isomorphic to \pi_1(Y);   \bullet there are arc connected topological spaces X and Y such that \pi_1(X) is isomorphic to \pi_1(Y) but {\mathfrak P}^\omega(X) is not isomorphic to {\mathfrak P}^\omega(Y);   \bullet for arc connected topological space X we have {\mathfrak P}^\omega(X)\subseteq{\mathfrak P}^c(X) \subseteq\pi_1(X);   \bullet for Hawaiian earring \mathcal X, the sets {\mathfrak P}^\omega({\mathcal X}), {\mathfrak P}^c({\mathcal X}), and \pi_1({\mathcal X}) are pairwise distinct.   So {\mathfrak P}^\alpha(X)s and {\mathfrak P}_{\mathcal I}^\alpha(X)s will help us to classify the class of all arc connected topological spaces with isomorphic fundamental groups.
