Let p be any prime, and let {\mathcal B}(p) be the algebra of operations on the cohomology ring of any cocommutative \mathbb{F}_p-Hopf algebra. In this paper we show that when p is odd (and unlike the p=2 case), {\mathcal B}(p) cannot become an object in the Singer category of \mathbb{F}_p-algebras with coproducts, if we require that coproducts act on the generators of {\mathcal B}(p) coherently with their nature of cohomology operations
