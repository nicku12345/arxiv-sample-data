In the context of commutative differential graded algebras over \mathbb Q, we show that an iteration of "odd spherical fibration" creates a "total space" commutative differential graded algebra with only odd degree cohomology. Then we show for such a commutative differential graded algebra that, for any of its "fibrations" with "fiber" of finite cohomological dimension, the induced map on cohomology is injective.
