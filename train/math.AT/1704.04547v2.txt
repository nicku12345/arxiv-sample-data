In this paper, we produce a cellular motivic spectrum of motivic modular forms over \R and \C, answering positively to a conjecture of Dan Isaksen. This spectrum is constructed to have the appropriate cohomology, as a module over the relevant motivic Steenrod algebra. We first produce a \G-equivariant version of this spectrum, and then use a machinery to construct a motivic spectrum from an equivariant one. We believe that this machinery will be of independent interest.
