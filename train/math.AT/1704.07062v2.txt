From a map of operads \eta : O\rightarrow O', we introduce a cofibrant replacement of the operad O in the category of bimodules over itself such that the corresponding model of the derived mapping space of bimodules Bimod_{O}^{h}(O;O') is an algebra over the one dimensional little cubes operad \mathcal{C}_{1}. In the present work, we also build an explicit weak equivalence of \mathcal{C}_{1}-algebras from the loop space \Omega Operad^{h}(O;O') to Bimod_{O}^{h}(O;O').
