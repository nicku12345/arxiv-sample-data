Let e_n be the connective cover of the Morava E-theory spectrum E_n of height n. In this paper we compute its homology H_*(e_n;\mathbb{F}_p) for any prime p and n \leq 4 up to possible multiplicative extensions. In order to accomplish this we show that the K\"unneth spectral sequence based on an E_3-algebra R is multiplicative when the R-modules in question are commutative S-algebras. We then apply this result by working over BP which is known to be an E_4-algebra.
