Let H be a subgroup of \pi_{1}(X,x_{0}). In this paper, we extend the concept of X being SLT space to H-SLT space at x_0. First, we show that the fibers of the endpoint projection p_{H}:\tilde{X}_{H}\rightarrow X are topological group when X is H-SLT space at x_0 and H is a normal subgroup. Also, we show that under these conditions the concepts of homotopically path Hausdorff relative to H and homotopically Hausdorff relative to H coincide. Moreover, among other things, we show that the endpoint projection map p_{H} has the unique path lifting property if and only if H is a closed normal subgroup of \pi_{1}^{qtop}(X,x_{0}) when X is SLT at x_{0}. Second, we present conditions under which the whisker topology is agree with the quotient of compact-open topology on \tilde{X}_{H}. Also, we study the relationship between open subsets of \pi_{1}^{wh}(X,x_{0}) and \pi_{1}^{qtop}(X,x_{0}).
