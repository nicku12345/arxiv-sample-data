In this paper we consider all orientation-preserving \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}-actions on 3-dimensional handlebodies V_g of genus g>0 for p an odd prime. To do so, we examine particular graphs of groups (\Gamma(v),\mathbf{G(v)}) in canonical form for some 5-tuple v =(r,s,t,m,n) with r+s+t+m>0. These graphs of groups correspond to the handlebody orbifolds V(\Gamma(v),{\mathbf{G(v)}}) that are homeomorphic to the quotient spaces V_g/\mathbb{Z}_{p^2} of genus less than or equal to g. This algebraic characterization is used to enumerate the total number of \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}-actions on such handlebodies, up to equivalence.
