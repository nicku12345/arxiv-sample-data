We introduce and study ternary f-distributive structures, Ternary f-quandles and more generally their higher n-ary analogues. A classification of ternary f-quandles is provided in low dimensions. Moreover, we study extension theory and introduce a cohomology theory for ternary, and more generally n-ary, f-quandles. Furthermore, we give some computational examples.
