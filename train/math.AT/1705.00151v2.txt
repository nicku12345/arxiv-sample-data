Hypergraph is a topological model for networks. In order to study the topology of hypergraphs, the homology of the associated simplicial complexes and the embedded homology have been invented. In this paper, we give some algorithms to compute the homology of the associated simplicial complexes and the embedded homology of hypergraphs as well as some heuristics for efficient computations.
