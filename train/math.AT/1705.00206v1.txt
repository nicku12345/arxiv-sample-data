In this paper, we introduce a subcategory \widetilde{Sh}_* of Sh_* and obtain some results in this subcategory. First we show that there is a natural bijection Sh (\Sigma (X, x), (Y,y))\cong Sh((X,x),Sh((I, \dot{I}),(Y,y))), for every (Y,y)\in \widetilde{Sh}_* and (X,x)\in Sh_*. By this fact, we prove that for any pointed topological space (X,x) in \widetilde{Sh}_*, \check{\pi}_n^{top}(X,x)\cong \check{\pi}_{n-k}^{top}(Sh((S^k, *),(X,x)), e_x), for all 1\leq k \leq n-1.
