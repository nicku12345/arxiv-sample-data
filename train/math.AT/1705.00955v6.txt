We interpret some results of persistent homology and barcodes (in any dimension) with the language of microlocal sheaf theory. For that purpose we study the derived category of sheaves on a real finite-dimensional vector space V. By using the operation of convolution, we introduce a pseudo-distance on this category and prove in particular a stability result for direct images. Then we assume that V is endowed with a closed convex proper cone \gamma with non empty interior and study \gamma-sheaves, that is, constructible sheaves with microsupport contained in the antipodal to the polar cone (equivalently, constructible sheaves for the \gamma-topology). We prove that such sheaves may be approximated (for the pseudo-distance) by "piecewise linear" \gamma-sheaves. Finally we show that these last sheaves are constant on stratifications by \gamma-locally closed sets, an analogue of barcodes in higher dimension.
