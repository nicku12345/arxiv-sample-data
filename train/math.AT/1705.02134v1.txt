We produce first examples of p-local height three TAF homology theories. The corresponding one-dimensional formal groups arise as split summands of the formal groups of certain abelian three-folds, the Shimura variety of which can be reinterpreted as moduli of a family of Picard curves. This allows an explicit description of an automorphic form valued genus in terms of the coefficients of these curves. Moreover, our construction is such that the theories naturally come with restriction maps to TAF theories of lower height.
