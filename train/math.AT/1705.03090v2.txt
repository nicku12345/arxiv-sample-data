We use nonabelian Poincar\'e duality to recover the stable splitting of compactly supported mapping spaces, \rm{Map_c}(M,\Sigma^nX), where M is a parallelizable n-manifold. Our method for deriving this splitting is new, and naturally extends to give a more general stable splitting of the space of compactly supported sections of a certain bundle on M with fibers \Sigma^nX, twisted by the tangent bundle of M. This generalization incorporates possible O(n)-actions on X as well as accommodating non-parallelizable manifolds.
