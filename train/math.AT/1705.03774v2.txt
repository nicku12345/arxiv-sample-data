This is an exposition of homotopical results on the geometric realization of semi-simplicial spaces. We then use these to derive basic foundational results about classifying spaces of topological categories, possibly without units. The topics considered include: fibrancy conditions on topological categories; the effect on classifying spaces of freely adjoining units; approximate notions of units; Quillen's Theorems A and B for non-unital topological categories; the effect on classifying spaces of changing the topology on the space of objects; the Group-Completion Theorem.
