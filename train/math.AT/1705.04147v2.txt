This paper is a continuation of a previous paper joint with Dennis Sullivan (arXiv:1704.04308). Working in the context of commutative differential graded algebras, we study the ideal of the cohomology classes which can be annihilated by fibrations whose fiber has finite homological dimension. In the present paper we identify these classes with certain higher products in cohomology.
