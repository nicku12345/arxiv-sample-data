Let G be a finite group acting freely on a finitistic space X having cohomology type (0, b) (for example, S^n x S^{2n} is a space of type (0, 1) and the one-point union S^n V S^{2n} V S^{3n} is a space of type (0, 0)). It is known that a finite group G which contains Zp + Zp + Zp, p a prime, can not act freely on S^n x S^{2n}. In this paper, we show that if a finite group G acts freely on a space of type (0, 1), where n is odd, then G can not contain Zp + Zp, p an odd prime. For spaces of cohomology type (0, 0), we show that every p-subgroup of G is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group. Moreover, for n even, it is shown that Z2 is the only group which can act freely on X.
