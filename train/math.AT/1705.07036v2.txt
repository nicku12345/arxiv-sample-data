We determine the Gross-Hopkins duals of certain higher real K-theory spectra. More specifically, let p be an odd prime, and consider the Morava E-theory spectrum of height n=p-1. It is known, in the expert circles, that for certain finite subgroups G of the Morava stabilizer group, the homotopy fixed point spectra E_n^{hG} are Gross-Hopkins self-dual up to a shift. In this paper, we determine the shift for those finite subgroups G which contain p-torsion. This generalizes previous results for n=2 and p=3.
