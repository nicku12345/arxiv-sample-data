We introduce the abstract notion of a necklical set in order to describe a functorial combinatorial model of the path fibration over the geometric realization of a path connected simplicial set. In particular, to any path connected simplicial set X we associate a necklical set \widehat{\mathbf{\Omega}}X such that its geometric realization |\widehat{\mathbf{\Omega}}X|, a space built out of gluing cubical cells, is homotopy equivalent to the based loop space on |X| and the differential graded module of chains C_*(\widehat{\mathbf{\Omega}}X) is a differential graded associative algebra generalizing Adams' cobar construction.
