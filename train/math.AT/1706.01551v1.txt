In this paper we restrict ourselves to the particular case where the pseudogroup is \Gamma \ltimes G given by the action of a dense subgroup \Gamma of a Lie group G acting on G by left translations. For a Riemannian foliation F on a complete Riemannian manifold M which is transversally parallelizable in the sense of Molino, let X be the space of leaves closures. The holonomy pseudogroup of F is an example of a locally trivial extension of X by \Gamma \ltimes G. The study of a generalization of this particular case shall be the main purpose of this paper.
