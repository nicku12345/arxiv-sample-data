We study the asymptotic behavior of the homotopy groups of simply connected finite p-local complexes, and define a space to be locally hyperbolic if its homotopy groups have exponential growth. Under some certain conditions related to the functorial decomposition of loop suspension, we prove that the suspended finite complexes are locally hyperbolic if suitable but accessible information of the homotopy groups is known. In particular, we prove that Moore spaces are locally hyperbolic, and other candidates are also given.
