Let B{ aut}_1X be the Dold-Lashof classifying space of orientable fibrations with fiber X. For a rationally weakly trivial map f:X\to Y, our strictly induced map a_f: (Baut_1X)_0\to (Baut_1Y)_0 induces a natural map from a X_0-fibration to a Y_0-fibration. It is given by a map between the differential graded Lie algebras of derivations of Sullivan models. We note some conditions that the map a_f admits a section and note some relations with the Halperin conjecture. Furthermore we give the obstruction class for a lifting of a classifying map h: B\to (Baut_1Y)_0 and apply it for liftings of G-actions on Y for a compact connected Lie group G as the case of B=BG and evaluating of rational toral ranks as r_0(Y)\leq r_0(X).
