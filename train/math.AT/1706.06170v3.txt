Recently we introduced a class \widetilde{\mathcal{Z}} of 2-local finite spectra and showed that all spectra Z\in \widetilde{\mathcal{Z}} admit a v_2-self-map of periodicity 1. The aim of this article is to compute the K(2)-local homotopy groups \pi_*L_{K(2)}Z of all spectra Z \in \widetilde{\mathcal{Z}} using a homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, and we give an almost complete computation. The incompleteness lies in the fact that we are unable to eliminate one family of d_3-differentials and a few potential hidden extensions, though we conjecture that all these differentials and hidden extensions are trivial.
