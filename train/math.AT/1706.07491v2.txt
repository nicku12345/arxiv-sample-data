We use the non-proper Morse theory of Palais-Smale to investigate the topology of smooth closed subvarieties of complex semi-abelian varieties, and that of their infinite cyclic covers. As main applications, we obtain the finite generation (except in the middle degree) of the corresponding integral Alexander modules, as well as the signed Euler characteristic property and generic vanishing for rank-one local systems on such subvarieties. Furthermore, we give a more conceptual (topological) interpretation of the signed Euler characteristic property in terms of vanishing of Novikov homology. As a byproduct, we prove a generic vanishing result for the L^2-Betti numbers of very affine manifolds. Our methods also recast June Huh's extension of Varchenko's conjecture to very affine manifolds, and provide a generalization of this result in the context of smooth closed subvarieties of semi-abelian varieties.
