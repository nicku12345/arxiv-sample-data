Two DGAs are called topologically equivalent if the corresponding Eilenberg-Mac Lane ring spectra are weakly equivalent as ring spectra. Quasi-isomorphic DGAs are topologically equivalent but the converse is not necessarily true. As a counter-example, Dugger and Shipley showed that there are DGAs that are non-trivially topologically equivalent, i.e. topologically equivalent but not quasi-isomorphic.   In this work, we define E_\infty topological equivalences and utilize the obstruction theories developed by Goerss, Hopkins and Miller to construct first examples of non-trivially E_\infty topologically equivalent E_\infty DGAs. Also, we show using these obstruction theories that for co-connective E_\infty DGAs, E_\infty topological equivalences and quasi-isomorphisms agree. For E_\infty \mathbb{F}_p-DGAs with trivial first homology, we show that an E_\infty topological equivalence induces an isomorphism in homology that preserves the Dyer-Lashof operations and therefore induces an H_\infty  \mathbb{F}_p-equivalence.
