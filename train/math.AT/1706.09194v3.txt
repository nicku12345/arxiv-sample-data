Let (L,d) be a differential graded Lie algebra, where L=L(V) is free as graded Lie algebra and V=V_{\geq 0} is a finite type graded vector space. We prove that the injection of (L,d) into its completion (\widehat{L},d) is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if H(L,d) is a finite type pronilpotent graded Lie algebra. As a consequence, we obtain an equivalence between graded Lie models for nilpotent spaces in rational homotopy theory.
