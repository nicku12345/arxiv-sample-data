The free loops space \Lambda X of a space X has become an important object of study particularly in the case when X is a manifold.The study of free loop spaces is motivated in particular by two main examples. The first is their relation to geometrically distinct periodic geodesics on a manifold, originally studied by Gromoll and Meyer in 1969. More recently the study of string topology and in particular the Chas-Sullivan loop product has been an active area of research.   A complete flag manifold is the quotient of a Lie group by its maximal torus and is one of the nicer examples of a homogeneous space. Both the cohomology and Chas-Sullivan product structure are understood for spaces S^n, \mathbb{C}P^n and most simple Lie groups. Hence studying the topology of the free loops space on homogeneous space is a natural next step.   In the thesis we compute the differentials in the integral Leray-Serre spectral sequence associated to the free loops space fibrations in the cases of SU(n+1)/T^n and Sp(n)/T^n. Study in detail the structure of the third page of the spectral sequence in the case of SU(n) and give the module structure of H^*(\Lambda(SU(3)/T^2);\mathbb{Z}) and H^*(\Lambda(Sp(2)/T^2);\mathbb{Z}).
