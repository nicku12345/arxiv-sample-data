The paper is devoted to study the nth Hawaiian group \mathcal{H}_n, n \ge 1, of the wedge sum of two spaces (X,x_*) = (X_1, x_1) \vee (X_2, x_2).   Indeed, we are going to give some versions of the van Kampen theorem for Hawaiian groups of the wedge sum of spaces.   First, among some results on Hawaiian groups of semilocally strongly contractible spaces, we present a structure for the nth Hawaiian group of the wedge sum of CW-complexes.   Second, we give more informative structures for the nth Hawaiian group of the wedge sum X, when X is semilocally n-simply connected at x_*.   Finally, as a consequence, by generalizing the well-known Griffiths space for dimension n\geq 1, we give some information about the structure of Hawaiian groups of Griffiths spaces at any points.
