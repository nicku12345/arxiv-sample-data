Let G be a simply-connected, compact, simple Lie group of low rank relative to a fixed prime p. After localization at p, there is a space A which "generates" G in a certain sense. Assuming G satisfies a homotopy nilpotency condition relative to p, we show that the Samelson product \langle Id_G, Id_G\rangle of the identity of G equals the order of the Samelson product \langle\imath,\imath\rangle of the inclusion \imath:A\to G. Applying this result, we calculate the orders of \langle Id_G,Id_G\rangle for all p-regular Lie groups and give bounds on the orders of \langle Id_G,Id_G\rangle for certain quasi-p-regular Lie groups.
