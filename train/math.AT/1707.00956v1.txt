Nilpotence in the homotopy of \mathbb{E}_\infty-ring spectra is detected by the classical H\mathbb{Z}-Hurewicz homomorphism. Inspired by questions of Mathew, Noel, and Naumann, we investigate the extent to which this criterion holds in the homotopy of \mathbb{E}_n-ring spectra. For all odd primes p and all chromatic heights h, we use the Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer theorem to construct examples of K(h)-local, \mathbb{E}_{2n-1}-algebras with non-nilpotent p^n-torsion. We exploit the interaction of the Bousfield-Kuhn functor on odd spheres and Rezk's logarithm to show that our bound is sharp at height 1, and remark on the situation at height 2.
