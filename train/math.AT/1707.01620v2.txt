We show a few nontrivial extensions in the classical Adams spectral sequence. In particular, we compute that the 2-primary part of \pi_{51} is \mathbb{Z}/8\oplus\mathbb{Z}/8\oplus\mathbb{Z}/2. This was the last unsolved 2-extension problem left by the recent works of Isaksen and the authors (\cite{Isa1}, \cite{IX}, \cite{WX1}) through the 61-stem.   The proof of this result uses the RP^\infty technique, which was introduced by the authors in \cite{WX1} to prove \pi_{61}=0. This paper advertises this method through examples that have simpler proofs than in \cite{WX1}.
