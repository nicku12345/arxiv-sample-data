In this paper, we prove a conjecture of Blumberg and Hill regarding the existence of N_\infty-operads associated to given sequences \mathcal{F} = (\mathcal{F}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} of families of subgroups of G\times \Sigma_n. For every such sequence, we construct a model structure on the category of G-operads, and we use these model structures to define E_\infty^{\mathcal{F}}-operads, generalizing the notion of an N_\infty-operad, and to prove the Blumberg-Hill conjecture. We then explore questions of admissibility, rectification, and preservation under left Bousfield localization for these E_\infty^{\mathcal{F}}-operads, obtaining some new results as well for N_\infty-operads.
