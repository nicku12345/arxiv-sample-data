Spaces of holomorphic maps from the Riemann sphere to various complex manifolds (holomorphic curves ) have played an important role in several area of mathematics. In a seminal paper G. Segal investigated the homotopy type of holomorphic curves on complex projective spaces and M. Guest on compact smooth toric varieties.. Recently Mostovoy and Villanueva, obtained a far reaching generalisation of these results, and in particular (for holomorphic curves) improved the stability dimension obtained by Guest. In this paper, we generalize their result to holomorphic curves, on certain non-compact smooth toric varieties.
