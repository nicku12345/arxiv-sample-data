We extend earlier work of Waldhausen which defines operations on the algebraic K-theory of the one-point space. For a connected simplicial abelian group X and symmetric groups \Sigma_n, we define operations \theta^n \colon A(X) \rightarrow A(X{\times}B\Sigma_n) in the algebraic K-theory of spaces. We show that our operations can be given the structure of E_{\infty}-maps. Let \phi_n \colon A(X{\times}B\Sigma_n) \rightarrow A(X{\times}E\Sigma_n) \simeq A(X) be the \Sigma_n-transfer. We also develop an inductive procedure to compute the compositions \phi_n \circ \theta^n, and outline some applications.
