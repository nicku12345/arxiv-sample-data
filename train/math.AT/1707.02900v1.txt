In statistics cumulants are defined to be functions that measure the linear independence of random variables. In the non-communicative case the Boolean cumulants can be described as functions that measure deviation of a map between algebras from being an algebra morphism. In Algebraic topology maps that are homotopic to being algebra morphisms are studied using the theory of A_\infty algebras. In this paper we will explore the link between these two points of views on maps between algebras that are not algebra maps.
