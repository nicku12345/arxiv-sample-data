We study the beginning of the Taylor tower, supplied by manifold calculus of functors, for the space of r-immersions, which are immersions without r-fold self-intersections. We describe the first r layers of the tower and discuss the connectivities of the associated maps. We also prove several results about r-immersions that are of independent interest.
