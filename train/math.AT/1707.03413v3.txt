We show that Lubin-Tate spectra at the prime 2 are Real oriented and Real Landweber exact. The proof is by application of the Goerss-Hopkins-Miller theorem to algebras with involution. For each height n, we compute the entire homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for E_n with its C_2-action given by the formal inverse. We study, as the height varies, the Hurewicz images of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in the homotopy of these C_2-fixed points.
