This paper deals with the homotopy theory of differential graded operads. We endow the Koszul dual category of curved conilpotent cooperads, where the notion of quasi-isomorphism barely makes sense, with a model category structure Quillen equivalent to that of operads. This allows us to describe the homotopy properties of differential graded operads in a simpler and richer way, using obstruction methods.
