We use Richter's 2-primary proof of Gray's conjecture to give a homotopy decomposition of the fibre \Omega^3S^{17}\{2\} of the H-space squaring map on the triple loop space of the 17-sphere. This induces a splitting of the mod-2 homotopy groups \pi_\ast(S^{17}; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) in terms of the integral homotopy groups of the fibre of the double suspension E^2:S^{2n-1} \to \Omega^2S^{2n+1} and refines a result of Cohen and Selick, who gave similar decompositions for S^5 and S^9. We relate these decompositions to various Whitehead products in the homotopy groups of mod-2 Moore spaces and Stiefel manifolds to show that the Whitehead square [i_{2n}, i_{2n}] of the inclusion of the bottom cell of the Moore space P^{2n+1}(2) is divisible by 2 if and only if 2n=2, 4, 8 or 16.
