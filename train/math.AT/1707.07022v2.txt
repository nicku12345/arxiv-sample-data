Let M_{l,m} be the total space of the S^3-bundle over S^4 classified by the element l\sigma+m\rho\in{\pi_4(SO(4))}, l,m\in\mathbb Z. In this paper we study the homotopy theory of gauge groups of principal G-bundles over manifolds M_{l,m} when G is a simply connected simple compact Lie group such that \pi_6(G)=0. That is, G is one of the following groups: SU(n) (n\geq4), Sp(n) (n\geq2), Spin(n) (n\geq5), F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8. If the integral homology of M_{l,m} is torsion-free, we describe the homotopy type of the gauge groups over M_{l,m} as products of recognisable spaces. For any manifold M_{l,m} with non-torsion-free homology, we give a p-local homotopy decomposition, for a prime p\geq 5, of the loop space of the gauge groups.
