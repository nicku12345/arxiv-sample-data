We show rational homological stability for the homotopy automorphisms and block diffeomorphims of iterated connected sums of products of spheres. The spheres can have different dimension, but need to satisfy a certain connectivity assumption. The main theorems of this paper extend homological stability results for automorphism spaces of connected sums of products of spheres of the same dimension by Berglund and Madsen.
