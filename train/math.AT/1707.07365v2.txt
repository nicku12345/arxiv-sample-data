In this work we construct nontrivial Massey products in the cohomology of moment-angle manifolds corresponding to polytopes from the Pogorelov class. This class includes the dodecahedron and all fullerenes, i. e. simple 3-polytopes with only 5-gonal and 6-gonal facets. The existence of a nontrivial Massey product implies the nonformality of the space in the sense of rational homotopy theory.
