We revisit generic vanishing results for perverse sheaves with any field coefficients on a complex semi-abelian variety, and indicate several topological applications. In particular, we obtain finiteness properties for the integral Alexander modules of complex algebraic varieties mapping to semi-abelian varieties. Similar results were recently derived by the authors by using Morse-theoretic arguments.
