The goal of this paper is to address the following question: if A is an \mathbf{E}_{k}-ring for some k\geq 1 and f\colon\pi_0 A \to B is a map of commutative rings, when can we find an \mathbf{E}_{k}-ring R with an \mathbf{E}_{k}-ring map g\colon A \to R such that \pi_0 g = f? A classical result in the theory of realizing \mathbf{E}_\infty-rings, due to Goerss--Hopkins, gives an affirmative answer to this question if f is etale. The goal of this paper is to provide answers to this question when f is ramified. We prove a non-realizability result in the K(n)-local setting for every n\geq 1 for H_\infty-rings containing primitive pth roots of unity. As an application, we give a proof of the folk result that the Lubin--Tate tower from arithmetic geometry does not lift to a tower of H_\infty-rings over Morava E-theory.
