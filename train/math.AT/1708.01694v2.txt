In this paper we study the topological structure of moment-angle complexes \mathcal{Z_K}. We consider two classes of simplicial complexes. The first class B_{\Delta} consists of simplicial complexes \mathcal{K} for which \mathcal{Z_K} is homotopy equivalent to a wedge spheres. The second class W_{\Delta} consists of \mathcal{K}\in B_{\Delta} such that all spheres in the wedge are realized by iterated higher Whitehead products. Buchstaber and Panov asked if it is true that B_{\Delta} = W_{\Delta}. In this paper we show that this is not the case. Namely, we give an example of a simplicial complex whose corresponding moment-angle complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres, but there is a sphere which cannot be realized by any linear combination of iterated higher Whitehead products.   On the other hand we show that class W_{\Delta} is large enough. Namely, we show that the class W_{\Delta} is closed with respect to two explicitly defined operations on simplicial complexes. Then using these operations we prove that there exists a simplicial complex that realizes any given iterated higher Whitehead product. Also we describe the smallest simplicial complex that realizes an iterated product with only two pairs of nested brackets.
