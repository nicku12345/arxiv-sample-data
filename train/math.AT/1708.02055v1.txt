Let K be an arbitrary semi-cubical set that can be embedded in a standard cube. Using Discrete Morse Theory, we construct a CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to the space \vec{P}(K)_v^w of directed paths between two given vertices v,w of K. In many cases, this construction is minimal: the cells of the constructed CW-complex are in 1--1 correspondence with the generators of the homology of \vec{P}(K)_v^w.
