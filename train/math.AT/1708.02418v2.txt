Let X be a smooth manifold with a (smooth) involution \sigma:X\to X such that Fix(\sigma)\ne \emptyset. We call the space P(m,X):=\mathbb{S}^m\times X/\!\sim where (v,x)\sim (-v,\sigma(x)) a generalized Dold manifold. When X is an almost complex manifold and the differential T\sigma: TX\to TX is conjugate complex linear on each fibre, we obtain a formula for the Stiefel-Whitney polynomial of P(m,X) when H^1(X;\mathbb{Z}_2)=0. We obtain results on stable parallelizability of P(m,X) and a very general criterion for the (non) vanishing of the unoriented cobordism class [P(m,X)] in terms of the corresponding properties for X. These results are applied to the case when X is a complex flag manifold.
