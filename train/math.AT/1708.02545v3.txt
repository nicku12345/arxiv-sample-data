We confirm a conjecture of Quillen in the case of the mod 2 cohomology of arithmetic groups {\rm SL}_2({\mathcal{O}}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-m})}[\frac{1}{2}]\thinspace), where {\mathcal{O}}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-m}\thinspace)} is an imaginary quadratic ring of integers. To make explicit the free module structure on the cohomology ring conjectured by Quillen, we compute the mod 2 cohomology of {\rm SL}_2({\mathbb{Z}}[\sqrt{-2}\thinspace][\frac{1}{2}]) via the amalgamated decomposition of the latter group.
