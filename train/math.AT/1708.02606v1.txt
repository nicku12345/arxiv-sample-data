In this paper, by introducing some kind of small loop transfer spaces at a point, we study the behavior of topologized fundamental groups with the compact-open topology and the whisker topology, \pi_{1}^{qtop}(X,x_{0}) and \pi_{1}^{wh}(X,x_{0}), respectively. In particular, we give necessary or sufficient conditions for coincidence and being topological group of these two topologized fundamental groups. Finally, we give some examples to show that the reverse of some of these implications do not hold, in general.
