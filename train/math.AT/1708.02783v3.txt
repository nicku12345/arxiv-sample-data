We study the Lie ring \mathfrak{nil}_n of all strictly upper-triangular n\!\times\!n matrices with entries in \mathbb{Z}. Its complete homology for n\!\leq\!8 is computed. We prove that every p^m-torsion appears in H_\ast(\mathfrak{nil}_n;\mathbb{Z}) for p^m\!\leq\!n\!-\!2. For m\!=\!1, Dwyer proved that the bound is sharp, i.e. there is no p-torsion in H_\ast(\mathfrak{nil}_n;\mathbb{Z}) when prime p\!>\!n\!-\!2. In general, for m\!>\!1 the bound is not sharp, as we show that there is 8-torsion in H_\ast(\mathfrak{nil}_8;\mathbb{Z}). As a sideproduct, we derive the known result, that the ranks of the free part of H_\ast(\mathfrak{nil}_n;\mathbb{Z}) are the Mahonian numbers (=number of permutations of [n] with k inversions), using a different approach than Kostant. Furthermore, we determine the algebra structure (cup products) of H^\ast(\mathfrak{nil}_n;\mathbb{Q}).
