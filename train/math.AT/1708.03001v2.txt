In this paper we develop techniques to compute the cooperations algebra for the second truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum \tBP{2}. We prove that the cooperations algebra \tBP{2}_*\tBP{2} decomposes as a direct some of a \F_2-vector space concentrated in Adams filtration 0 and a \F_2[v_0,v_1,v_2]-module which is concentrated in even degrees and v_2-torsion free. A recursive procedure is also developed to provide an basis of the v_2-torsion free part.
