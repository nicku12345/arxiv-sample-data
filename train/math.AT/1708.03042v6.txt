We show that the homotopy groups of a connective E_k-ring spectrum with an E_k-cell attached along a class \alpha in degree n are isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the cofiber of the self-map associated to \alpha through degree 2n. Using this, we prove that the 2n-1^{st} homotopy groups of Ravenel's X(n) spectra are cyclic for all n. This further implies that, after localizing at a prime, X(n+1) is homotopically unique as the E_1-X(n)-algebra with homotopy groups in degree 2n-1 killed by an E_1-cell. Lastly, we prove analogous theorems for a sequence of E_k-ring Thom spectra, for each odd k, which are formally similar to Ravenel's X(n) spectra and whose colimit is also MU.
