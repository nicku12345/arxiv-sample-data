K. Borsuk in 1979, in the Topological Conference in Moscow, introduced the concept of the capacity of a compactum. In this paper, we compute the capacity of the product of two spheres of the same or different dimensions and the capacity of lense spaces. Also, we present an upper bound for the capacity of a \mathbb{Z}_n-complex, i.e., a connected finite 2-dimensional CW-complex with finite cyclic fundamental group \mathbb{Z}_n.
