Given a map f\colon X \to Y, we extend a Gottlieb's result to the generalized Gottlieb group G^f(Y,f(x_0)) and show that the canonical isomorphism \pi_1(Y,f(x_0))\xrightarrow{\approx}\mathcal{D}(Y) restricts to an isomorphism G^f(Y,f(x_0))\xrightarrow{\approx}\mathcal{D}^{\tilde{f}_0}(Y), where \mathcal{D}^{\tilde{f}_0}(Y) is some subset of the group \mathcal{D}(Y) of deck transformations of Y for a fixed lifting \tilde{f}_0 of f with respect to universal coverings of X and Y, respectively.
