The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category cat(X) is a homotopy invariant which is a numerical bound on the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold. Another similar invariant is the topological complexity TC(X) (a la Farber) which has interesting applications in Robotics, specifically, in the robot motion planning problem. In this paper we calculate the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and as a consequence we calculate the topological complexity of the two-point ordered configuration space of \mathbb{CP}^n for every n\geq 1.
