We investigate under which assumptions a subclass of flat quasi-coherent shea\-ves on a quasi-compact and semi-separated scheme allows to "mock" the homotopy category of projective modules. Our methods are based on module theoretic properties of the subclass of flat modules involved as well as their behaviour with respect to Zariski localizations. As a consequence we get that, for such schemes, the derived category of flats is equivalent to the derived category of very flats. If, in addition, the scheme satisfies the resolution property then both derived categories are equivalent to the derived category of infinite-dimensional vector bundles. The equivalences are inferred from a Quillen equivalence between the corresponding models.
