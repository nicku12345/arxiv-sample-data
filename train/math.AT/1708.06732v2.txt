The well-known theorem of Eilenberg and Ganea expresses the Lusternik - Schnirelmann category of an aspherical space as the cohomological dimension of its fundamental group. In this paper we study a similar problem of determining algebraically the topological complexity of the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. One of our main results states that in the case when the fundamental group is hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov the topological complexity of an aspherical space K(\pi, 1) either equals or is by one larger than the cohomological dimension of \pi\times \pi. We approach the problem by studying essential cohomology classes, i.e. classes which can be obtained from the powers of the canonical class via coefficient homomorphisms. We describe a spectral sequence which allows to specify a full set of obstructions for a cohomology class to be essential. In the case of a hyperbolic group we establish a vanishing property of this spectral sequence which leads to the main result.
