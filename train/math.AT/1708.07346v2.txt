In this paper, we aim to establish a new shape theory, compact Hausdorff shape (CH-shape) for general Hausdorff spaces. We use the "internal" method and direct system approach on the homotopy category of compact Hausdorff spaces. Such a construction can preserve most good properties of H-shape given by Rubin and Sanders. Most importantly, we can moreover develop the entire homology theory for CH-shape, including the exactness, dual to the consequence of Marde\v{s}i\'c and Segal.
