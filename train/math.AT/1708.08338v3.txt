We present a formula to compute the Brasselet number of f:(Y,0)\to (\C, 0) where Y\subset X is a non-degenerate complete intersection in a toric variety X. As applications we establish several results concerning invariance of the Brasselet number for families of non-degenerate complete intersections. Moreover, when (X,0) = (\mathbb{C}^n,0) we derive sufficient conditions to obtain the invariance of the Euler obstruction for families of complete intersections with an isolated singularity which are contained in X.
