Equipping a non-equivariant topological E_\infty operad with the trivial G-action gives an operad in G-spaces. The algebra structure encoded by this operad in G-spectra is characterised homotopically by having no non-trivial multiplicative norms. Algebras over this operad are called naive-commutative ring G-spectra. In this paper we let G be a finite group and we show that commutative algebras in the algebraic model for rational G-spectra model the rational naive-commutative ring G-spectra.
