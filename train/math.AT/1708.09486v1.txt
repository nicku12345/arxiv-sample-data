We show that Ravenel's spectrum X(2) is the versal E_1-S-algebra of characteristic \eta. This implies that every E_1-S-algebra R of characteristic \eta admits an E_1-ring map X(2)\to R, i.e. an \mathbb{A}_\infty complex orientation of degree 2. This implies that R^\ast(\mathbb{C}P^2)\cong R_\ast[x]/x^3. Additionally, if R is an \mathbb{E}_2-ring Thom spectrum admitting a map (of homotopy ring spectra) from X(2), e.g. X(n), its topological Hochschild homology has a simple description.
