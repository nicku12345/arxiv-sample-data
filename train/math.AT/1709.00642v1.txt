The aim of this article is to review different generalizations of the the notion of topological complexity to the equivariant setting. In particular, we review the relation (or non-relation) between these notions and the topological complexity of the quotient space and the topological complexity of the fixed point sets. We give examples of calculations and stress the question: When the action is free, do we recover the topological complexity of the quotient?
