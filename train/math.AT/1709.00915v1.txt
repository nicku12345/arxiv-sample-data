One can attempt to study motivic homotopy groups by mimicking the classical (non-motivic) chromatic approach. There are however major differences, which makes the motivic story more complicated and still not well understood. For example, classically the p-local sphere spectrum S^0_{(p)}  admits an essentially unique non-nilpotent self-map, which is not the case motivically, since Morel showed that the first Hopf map \eta \colon S^{1,1} \to S^{0,0} is non-nilpotent. In the same way that the non-nilpotent self-map 2 = v_0 \in \pi_{\ast,\ast}(S^{0,0}) starts the usual chromatic story of v_n-periodicity, there is a similar theory starting with the non-nilpotent element \eta \in \pi_{\ast,\ast}(S^{0,0}), which Andrews-Miller denoted by \eta = w_0. In this paper we investigate the beginning of the motivic story of w_n-periodicity when the base scheme is \mathbf{Spec} \! \ \mathbb{C}. In particular, we construct motivic fields K(w_n) designed to detect such w_n-periodic phenomena, in the same way that K(n) detects v_n-periodic phenomena. In the hope of detecting motivic nilpotence, we also construct a more global motivic spectrum wBP with homotopy groups \pi_{\ast,\ast}(wBP) \cong \mathbb{F}_2[w_0, w_1, \ldots].
