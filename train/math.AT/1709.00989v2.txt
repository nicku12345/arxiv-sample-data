We consider twisted equivariant K--theory for actions of a compact Lie group G on a space X where all the isotropy subgroups are connected and of maximal rank. We show that the associated rational spectral sequence \`a la Segal has a simple E_2--term expressible as invariants under the Weyl group of G. Namely, if T is a maximal torus of G, they are invariants of the \pi_1(X^T)-equivariant Bredon cohomology of the universal cover of X^T with suitable coefficients. In the case of the inertia stack \Lambda Y this term can be expressed using the cohomology of Y^T and algebraic invariants associated to the Lie group and the twisting. A number of calculations are provided. In particular, we recover the rational Verlinde algebra when Y=\{*\}.
