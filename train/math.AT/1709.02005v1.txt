We describe the structure present in algebras over the little disks operads for various representations of a finite group G, including those that are not necessarily universe or that do not contain trivial summands. We then spell out in more detail what happens for G=C_{2}, describing the structure on algebras over the little disks operad for the sign representation. Here we can also describe the resulting structure in Bredon homology. Finally, we produce a stable splitting of coinduced spaces analogous to the stable splitting of the product, and we use this to determine the homology of the signed James construction.
