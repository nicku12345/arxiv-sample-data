Suppose that M is a topological monoid satisfying \pi_0M=\mathbb{N} to which the McDuff-Segal group-completion theorem applies. This implies that a certain map f: \mathbb{M}_{\infty}\rightarrow \Omega BM defined on an infinite mapping telescope is a homology equivalence with integer coefficients. In this short note we give an elementary proof of the result that if left- and right-stabilisation commute on H_1(M), then the "McDuff-Segal comparison map" f is acyclic. For example, this always holds if \pi_0M lies in the centre of the Pontryagin ring H_{\ast}(M). As an application we describe conditions on a commutative \mathbb{I}-monoid X under which \text{hocolim}_{\mathbb{I}}X can be identified with a Quillen plus-construction.
