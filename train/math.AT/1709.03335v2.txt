The orbit polytope for a finite group G acting linearly and freely on a sphere S is used to construct a cellularized fundamental domain for the action. A resolution of the integers over G results from the associated G-equivariant cellularization of S. This technique is applied to the generalized binary tetrahedral group family; the homology groups, the cohomology rings and the Reidemeister torsions of the related spherical space forms are determined.
