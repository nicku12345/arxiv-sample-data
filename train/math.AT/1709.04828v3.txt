For a finite abelian group A, we determine the Balmer spectrum of \mathrm{Sp}_A^{\omega}, the compact objects in genuine A-spectra. This generalizes the case A=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} due to Balmer and Sanders \cite{Balmer-Sanders}, by establishing (a corrected version of) their log_p-conjecture for abelian groups. We also work out the consequences for the chromatic type of fixed-points and establish a generalization of Kuhn's blue-shift theorem for Tate-constructions \cite{kuhn}.
