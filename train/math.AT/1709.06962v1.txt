First, by inspiration of the results of Wood \cite{differential,problems}, but with the methods of non-commutative geometry and different approach, we extend the coefficients of the Steenrod squaring operations from the filed \mathbb{F}_2 to the dyadic integers \mathbb{Z}_2 and call the resulted operations the dyadic Steenrod squares, denoted by Jq^k. The derivation-like operations Jq^k generate a graded algebra, called the dyadic Steenrod algebra, denoted by \mathcal{J}_2 acting on the polynomials \mathbb{Z}_2[\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n]. Being \mathcal{J}_2 an Ore domain, enable us to localize \mathcal{J}_2 which leads to the appearance of the integration-like operations Jq^{-k} satisfying the Jq^{-k}Jq^k=1=Jq^kJq^{-k}. These operations are enough to exhibit a kind of differential equation, the dyadic Steenrod ordinary differential equation. Then we prove that the completion of \mathbb{Z}_2[\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n] in the linear transformation norm coincides with a certain Tate algebra. Therefore, the rigid analytic geometry is closely related to the dyadic Steenrod algebra. Finally, we define the Adem norm \| \ \|_A in which the completion of \mathbb{Z}_2[\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n] is \mathbb{Z}_2\llbracket\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n\rrbracket, the n-variable formal power series. We surprisingly prove that an element f \in \mathbb{Z}_2\llbracket \xi_1,\dots,\xi_n\rrbracket is hit if and only if \|f\|_A<1. This suggests new techniques for the traditional Peterson hit problem in finding the bases for the cohit modules.
