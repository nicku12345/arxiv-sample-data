Let M be a smooth manifold, smoothly triangulated by a simplicial complex K, and \cA a transitive Lie algebroid on M. The Lie algebroid restriction of \cA to a simplex \Delta of K is denoted by \cA^{!!}_{\Delta}. A piecewise smooth form of degree p on \cA is a family \omega=(\omega_{\Delta})_{\Delta\in K} such that \omega_{\Delta}\in \Omega^{p}(\cA^{!!}_{\Delta};\Delta) for each \Delta\in K, satisfying the compatibility condition concerning the restrictions of \omega_{\Delta} to the faces of \Delta, that is, if \Delta' is a face of \Delta, the restriction of the form \omega_{\Delta} to the simplex \Delta' coincides with the form \omega_{\Delta'}. The set \Omega^{\ast}(\cA;K) of all piecewise smooth forms on \cA is a cochain algebra. One has a natural morphism \Omega^{\ast}(\cA;M)\rightarrow \Omega^{\ast}(\cA;K) of cochain algebras given by restriction of a smooth form defined on \cA to a smooth form defined on \cA^{!!}_{\Delta}, for all simplices \Delta of K. In this paper, we prove that, for triangulated compact manifolds, the cohomology of this construction is isomorphic to the Lie algebroid cohomology of \cA, in which the isomorphism is induced by the restriction map.
