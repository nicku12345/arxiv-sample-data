It is well known that if X is a CW-complex, then for every weak homotopy equivalence f:A\to B, the map f_*:[X,A]\to [X,B] induced in homotopy classes is a bijection. For which spaces X is f^*:[B,X]\to [A,X] a bijection for every weak equivalence f? This question was considered by J. Strom and T. Goodwillie. In this note we prove that a non-empty space inverts weak equivalences if and only if it is contractible.
