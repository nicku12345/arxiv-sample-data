We show that all generalized (real) Bott manifolds which are (small covers) quasitoric manifolds over a product of simplices \Delta^{n_1}\times\cdots\times\Delta^{n_r}\times\Delta^{1} are always boundaries of some manifolds. But these manifolds with the natural (\mathbb{Z}_2)^n action do not necessarily bound equvariantly. In addition, we can construct some examples of null-cobordant but not orientedly null-cobordant manifolds among quasitoric manifolds.
