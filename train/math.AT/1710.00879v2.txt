We study the fixed points of the universal G-equivariant n-dimensional complex vector bundle and obtain a decomposition formula in terms of twisted equivariant universal complex vector bundles of smaller dimension. We use this decomposition to describe the fixed points of the complex equivariant K-theory spectrum and the equivariant unitary bordism groups for adjacent families of subgroups.
