The persistence diagram of Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Harer was recently generalized by Patel to the case of constructible persistence modules with values in a symmetric monoidal category with images. Patel also introduced a distance for persistence diagrams, the erosion distance. Motivated by this work, we extend the erosion distance to a distance of rank invariants of generalized persistence modules by using the generalization of the interleaving distance of Bubenik, de Silva, and Scott as a guideline. This extension of the erosion distance also gives, as a special case, a distance for multidimensional persistent homology groups with torsion introduced by Frosini. We show that the erosion distance is stable with respect to the interleaving distance, and that it gives a lower bound for the natural pseudo-distance in the case of sublevel set persistent homology of continuous functions.
