In this paper we compute RO(G)-graded homotopy Mackey functors of H\underline{\mathbb{Z}}, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum of the constant Mackey functor of integers for cyclic p-groups and give a complete computation for G = C_{p^2} . We also discuss homological algebra of \underline{\mathbb{Z}}-modules for cyclic p-groups, and interactions between these two. The goal of this paper is to understand various slice spectral sequences as RO(G)-graded spectral sequences of Mackey functors.
