Let \mathcal{A}(1)^* be the subHopf algebra of the mod~2 Steenrod algebra \mathcal{A}^* generated by \mathrm{Sq}^1 and \mathrm{Sq}^2. The \emph{Joker} is the cyclic \mathcal{A}(1)^*-module \mathcal{A}(1)^*/\mathcal{A}(1)^*\{\mathrm{Sq}^3\} which plays a special r\^ole in the study of \mathcal{A}(1)^*-modules. We discuss realisations of the Joker both as an \mathcal{A}^*-module and as the cohomology of a spectrum. We also consider analogous \mathcal{A}(n)^*-modules for n\geq2 and prove realisability results (both stable and unstable) for n=2,3 and non-realisability results for n\geq4.
