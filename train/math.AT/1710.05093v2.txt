We show that the configuration spaces of a product of parallelizable manifolds may be recovered from those of the factors as the Boardman-Vogt tensor product of right modules over the operads of little cubes of the appropriate dimension. We also discuss an analogue of this result for manifolds that are not necessarily parallelizable, which involves a new operad of skew little cubes.
