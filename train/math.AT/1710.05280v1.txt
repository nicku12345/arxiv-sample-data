Let p be an odd prime number. We study the problem of determining the module structure over the mod p Steenrod algebra \mathcal A(p) of the Dickson algebra D_n consisting of all modular invariants of general linear group GL(n,\mathbb F_p). Here \mathbb F_p denotes the prime field of p elements. In this paper, we give an explicit answer for n=2. More precisely, we explicitly compute the action of the Steenrod-Milnor operations St^{S,R} on the generators of D_n for n=2 and for either S=\emptyset, R=(i) or S=(s), R=(i) with s,i arbitrary nonnegative integers.
