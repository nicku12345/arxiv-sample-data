Let p be an odd prime number. Denote by GL_n = GL(n,\mathbb F_p) the general linear group over the prime field \mathbb F_p. Each subgroup of GL_n acts on the algebra P_n=E(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\otimes \mathbb F_p(y_1,\ldots,y_n) in the usual manner. We grade P_n by assigning \dim x_i=1 and \dim y_i=2. This algebra is a module over the mod p Steenrod algebra \mathcal A_p. The purpose of the paper is to compute the action of the Steenrod-Milnor operations on the generators of P_2^{GL_2}. More precisely, we explicitly determine the action of St^{(i,j)} on the Dickson invariants Q_{2,0} and Q_{2,1}.
