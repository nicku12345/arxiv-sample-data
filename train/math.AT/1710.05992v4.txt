Recent work in higher algebra allows the reinterpretation of a classical description of the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum H\mathbb{Z} as a Thom spectrum, in terms of a kind of derived Galois theory. This essentially expository talk summarizes some of this work, and suggests an interpretation in terms of configuration spaces and monoidal functors on them, with some analogies to a topological field theory.
