Generalized Bott manifolds (over \mathbb C and \mathbb R) have been defined by Choi, Masuda and Suh. In this article we extend the results of arXiv:1609.05630 on the topology of real Bott manifolds to generalized real Bott manifolds. We give a presentation of the fundamental group, prove that it is solvable and give a characterization for it to be abelian. We further prove that these manifolds are aspherical only in the case of real Bott manifolds and compute the higher homotopy groups. Furthermore, using the presentation of the cohomology ring with \mathbb Z_2-coefficients, we derive a combinatorial characterization for orientablity and spin structure.
