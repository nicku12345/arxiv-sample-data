C_\infty Algebras and their morphisms are a framework in which one can study algebras and their maps that are not commutaive-associative but are homotopic to being that. In statistics cumulants measure the independence of random variables. Another way of describing them would be as measure of deviation from being an algebra map. In this paper we explore the notion of cumulants of C_\infty morphisms. This uses a previous analysis about Boolean cumulants of A_\infty morphisms.
