Polynomial solving algorithms are essential to applied mathematics and the sciences. As such, reduction of their complexity has become an incredibly important field of topological research. We present a topological approach to constructing a lower bound for the complexity of a polynomial-solving algorithm, and give a concrete algorithm to do this in the case that \mathrm{deg}(f) = 2,3,4.
