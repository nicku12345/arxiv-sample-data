Given a spherical fibration \xi over the classifying space BG of a finite group we define a dimension function for the m-fold fiber join of \xi where m is some large positive integer. We show that the dimension functions satisfy the Borel-Smith conditions when m is large enough. As an application we prove that there exists no spherical fibration over the classifying space of \text{Qd}(p)= (\mathbb{Z}/p)^2\rtimes\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/p) with p-effective Euler class, generalizing the result of \"Ozg\"un \"Unl\"u about group actions on finite complexes homotopy equivalent to a sphere. We have been informed that this result will also appear in a future paper as a corollary of a previously announced program on homotopy group actions due to Jesper Grodal.
