Let P_k be the graded polynomial algebra \mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k] with the degree of each generator x_i being 1, where \mathbb F_2 denote the prime field of two elements, and let GL_k be the general linear group over \mathbb F_2 which acts regularly on P_k. We study the algebraic transfer constructed by Singer using the technique of the Peterson hit problem. This transfer is a homomorphism from the homology of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra \mathcal A, \text{Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2), to the subspace of \mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k consisting of all the GL_k-invariant classes of degree d. In this paper, by using the results on the Peterson hit problem we present the proof of the fact that the Singer algebraic transfer is an isomorphism for k \leqslant 3. We also explicitly determine the fourth Singer algebraic transfer in some degrees.
