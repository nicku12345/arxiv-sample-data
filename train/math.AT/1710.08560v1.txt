Let G be a finite group. In this paper, we begin by providing an exposition of G-Mackey functors and a symmetric monoidal product on the category of Mackey functors called the box product. After computing several examples of box products for the case of G=C_p, the cyclic group of order p, we move to the heart of the paper, which is to find and classify all C_p-Mackey functors invertible for the box product.
