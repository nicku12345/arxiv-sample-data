Recently, Lawson has shown that the 2-primary Brown-Peterson spectrum does not admit the structure of an E_{12} ring spectrum, thus answering a question of May in the negative. We extend Lawson's result to odd primes by proving that the p-primary Brown-Peterson spectrum does not admit the structure of an E_{2(p^2+2)} ring spectrum. We also show that there can be no map MU \to BP of E_{2p+3} ring spectra at any prime.
