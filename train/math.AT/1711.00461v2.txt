We prove that certain conditions on multigraded Betti numbers of a simplicial complex K imply existence of a higher Massey product in cohomology of a moment-angle-complex \mathcal Z_K, which contains a unique element (a strictly defined product). Using the simplicial multiwedge construction, we find a family \mathcal{F} of polyhedral products being smooth closed manifolds such that for any l,r\geq 2 there exists an l-connected manifold M\in\mathcal F with a nontrivial strictly defined r-fold Massey product in H^{*}(M). As an application to homological algebra, we determine a wide class of triangulated spheres K such that a nontrivial higher Massey product of any order may exist in Koszul homology of their Stanley--Reisner rings. As an application to rational homotopy theory, we establish a combinatorial criterion for a simple graph \Gamma to provide a (rationally) formal generalized moment-angle manifold \mathcal Z_{P}^{J}=(D^{2j_{i}},S^{2j_{i}-1})^{\partial P^*}, J=(j_{1},\ldots,j_m) over a graph-associahedron P=P_{\Gamma} and compute all the diffeomorphism types of formal moment-angle manifolds over graph-associahedra.
