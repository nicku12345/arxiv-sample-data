Let H be a subgroup of the fundamental group \pi_{1}(X,x_{0}). By extending the concept of strong SLT space to a relative version with respect to H, strong H-SLT space, first, we investigate the existence of a covering map for strong H-SLT spaces. Moreover, we show that a semicovering map is a covering map in the presence of strong H-SLT property. Second, we present conditions under which the whisker topology agrees with the lasso topology on \widetilde{X}_{H}. Also, we study the relationship between open subsets of \pi_{1}^{wh}(X,x_{0}) and \pi_{1}^{l}(X,x_{0}). Finally, we give some examples to justify the definition and study of strong H-SLT spaces.
