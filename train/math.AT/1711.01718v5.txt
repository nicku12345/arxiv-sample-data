The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category cat and topological complexity TC are related homotopy invariants. The topological complexity TC has applications to the robot motion planning problem. We calculate the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and topological complexity of the ordered configuration space of two distinct points in the product G\times\mathbb{R}^n and apply the results to the planar and spatial motion of two rigid bodies in \mathbb{R}^2 and \mathbb{R}^3 respectively.
