Given a locally trivial fibre bundle E \to B (with fibres and base finite complexes), an orthogonal real line bundle \lambda over E and a real vector bundle \xi over B, we consider a fibrewise map f : S(\lambda ) \to \xi over B defined on the unit sphere bundle of \lambda. Following the fundamental work of Jaworowski and Dold on the parametrized Borsuk-Ulam theorem, we investigate lower bounds on the cohomological dimension of the set of points v in S(\lambda ) such that f(v) = f(-v).
