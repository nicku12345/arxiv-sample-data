The theory of lifting classes and the Reidemeister number of single-valued maps of a finite polyhedron X is extended to n-valued maps by replacing liftings to universal covering spaces by liftings with codomain an orbit configuration space, a structure recently introduced by Xicot\'encatl. The liftings of an n-valued map f split into self-maps of the universal covering space of X that we call lift-factors. An equivalence relation is defined on the lift-factors of f and the number of equivalence classes is the Reidemeister number of f. The fixed point classes of f are the projections of the fixed point sets of the lift-factors and are the same as those of Schirmer. An equivalence relation is defined on the fundamental group of X such that the number of equivalence classes equals the Reidemeister number. We prove that if X is a manifold of dimension at least three, then algebraically the orbit configuration space approach is the same as one utilizing the universal covering space. The Jiang subgroup is extended to n-valued maps as a subgroup of the group of covering transformations of the orbit configuration space and used to find conditions under which the Nielsen number of an n-valued map equals its Reidemeister number. If an n-valued map splits into n single-valued maps, then its n-valued Reidemeister number is the sum of their Reidemeister numbers.
