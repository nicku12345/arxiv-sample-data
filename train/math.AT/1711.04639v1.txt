We describe a Hopf ring structure on the direct sum of the cohomology groups \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} H^* \left( B_n; \mathbb{Z}_2 \right) of the Coxeter groups of type B_n, and an almost-Hopf ring structure on the direct sum of the cohomology groups \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} H^* \left( D_n; \mathbb{Z}_2 \right) of the Coxeter groups of type D_n, with coefficient in the field with two elements \mathbb{Z}_2. We give presentations with generators and relations, determine additive bases and compute the Steenrod algebra action. The generators are described both in terms of a geometric construction by De Concini and Salvetti and in terms of their restriction to elementary abelian 2-subgroups.
