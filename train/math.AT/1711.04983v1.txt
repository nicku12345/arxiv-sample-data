A real toric space is a topological space which admits a well-behaved \mathbb{Z}_2^k-action. Real moment-angle complexes and real toric varieties are typical examples of real toric spaces. A real toric space is determined by a pair of a simplicial complex K and a characteristic matrix \Lambda.   In this paper, we provide an explicit R-cohomology ring formula of a real toric space in terms of K and \Lambda, where R is a commutative ring with unity in which 2 is a unit. Interestingly, it has a natural (\mathbb{Z} \oplus \operatorname*{row} \Lambda)-grading. As corollaries, we compute the cohomology rings of (generalized) real Bott manifolds in terms of binary matroids, and we also provide a criterion for real toric spaces to be cohomology symplectic.
