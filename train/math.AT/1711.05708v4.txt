Let G be a finite p-group. The Eilenberg-Maclane spectrum of the constant Mackey functor \underline{\mathbb{F}}_p, denoted H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p, is modeled by the free \mathbb{F}_p-module on the G-equivariant sphere spectrum. With this construction, one has a `word length' filtration \{(H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p)_n\}_{n\ge 1}. Our main theorem is that the k-th layer (H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p)_{p^k}/(H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p)_{p^{k-1}} is p-locally equivalent to the k-fold suspension of the Steinberg summand of the G-equivariant classifying space of (\mathbb{Z}/p)^k. This is a generalization of the main result of [21]. We also show that when one smashes this filtration with H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p, the filtration splits into its layers. The future goal of this work is to compute the C_p-equivariant dual Steenrod algebra H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p\wedge H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p when p>2, via explicit cellular constructions of equivariant classifying spaces.
