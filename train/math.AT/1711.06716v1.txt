K. Borsuk in the seventies introduced the notions of capacity and depth of compacta together with some relevant problems. In this paper, first, we introduce the concepts of the (strong) capacity and the (strong) depth of an object in an arbitrary category. Then in the category of groups, we compute the (strong) capacity and the (strong) depth of some well-known groups. Finally, we find an upper bound for the depth of some classes of finite polyhedra which generalizes a result of D. Kolodziejczyk in this subject.
