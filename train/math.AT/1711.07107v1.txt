Let M be a smooth manifold and K\subset M be a simplicial complex of codimension at least 3. Functor calculus methods lead to a homotopical formula of M\setminus K in terms of spaces M\setminus T where T is a finite subset of K. This is a generalization of the author's previous work with Michael Weiss where the subset K is assumed to be a smooth submanifold of M and uses his generalization of manifold calculus adapted for simplicial complexes.
