Manifold calculus is a form of functor calculus that analyzes contravariant functors from some categories of manifolds to topological spaces by providing analytic approximations to them. In this paper, using the technique of the h-principle, we show that for a symplectic manifold N, the analytic approximation to the Lagrangian embeddings functor \mathrm{Emb}_{\mathrm{Lag}}(-,N) is the totally real embeddings functor \mathrm{Emb}_{\mathrm{TR}}(-,N). More generally, for subsets \mathcal{A} of the m-plane Grassmannian bundle \mathrm{Gr}(m,TN) for which the h-principle holds for \mathcal{A}-directed embeddings, we prove the analyticity of the \mathcal{A}-directed embeddings functor \mathrm{Emb}_{\mathcal{A}}(-,N).
