In this paper, we study further properties and applications of weighted homology and persistent homology. We introduce the Mayer-Vietoris sequence and generalized Bockstein spectral sequence for weighted homology. For applications, we show an algorithm to construct a filtration of weighted simplicial complexes from a weighted network. We also prove a theorem that allows us to calculate the mod p^2 weighted persistent homology given some information on the mod p weighted persistent homology.
