In 2002, Biss investigated on a kind of fibration which is called rigid covering fibration (we rename it by rigid fibration) with properties similar to covering spaces. In this paper, we obtain a relation between arbitrary topological spaces and its rigid fibrations. Using this relation we obtain a commutative diagram of homotopy groups and quasitopological homotopy groups and deduce some results in this field.
