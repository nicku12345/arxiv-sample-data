Let G be a finite group with 2-Sylow subgroup of order less than or equal to 16. For such a G, we prove a quantified version of Quillen's uniform \mathcal{F}_p-isomorphism theorem, which holds uniformly for all G-spaces. We do this by bounding from above the exponent of Borel equivariant \mathbf{F}_2-cohomology, as introduced by Mathew-Naumann-Noel, with respect to the family of elementary abelian 2-subgroups.
