For N_\infty operads \mathcal O and \mathcal O' such that there is an inclusion of the associated indexing systems, there is a forgetful functor from incomplete Tambara functors over \mathcal O' to incomplete Tambara functors over \mathcal O. Roughly speaking, this functor forgets the norms in \mathcal O' that are not present in \mathcal O. The forgetful functor has both a left and a right adjoint; the left adjoint is an operadic tensor product, but the right adjoint is more mysterious. We explicitly compute the right adjoint for finite cyclic groups of prime order.
