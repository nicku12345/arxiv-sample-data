We construct a natural transformation from the Bousfield-Kuhn functor evaluated on a space to the Topological Andre-Quillen cohomology of the K(n)-local Spanier-Whitehead dual of the space, and show that the map is an equivalence in the case where the space is a sphere. This results in a method for computing unstable v_n-periodic homotopy groups of spheres from their Morava E-cohomology (as modules over the Dyer-Lashof algebra of Morava E-theory). We relate the resulting algebraic computations to the algebraic geometry of isogenies between Lubin-Tate formal groups.
