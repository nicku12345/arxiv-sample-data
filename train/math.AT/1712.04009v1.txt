An A-cellular space is a space built from A and its suspensions, analogously to the way that CW-complexes are built from S^0 and its suspensions. The A-cellular approximation of a space X is an A-cellular space CW_{A}X which is closest to X among all A-cellular spaces. The A-complexity of a space X is an ordinal number that quantifies how difficult it is to build an A-cellular approximation of X. In this paper, we study spaces with low complexity. In particular we show that if A is a sphere localized at a set of primes then the A-complexity of each space X is at most 1.
