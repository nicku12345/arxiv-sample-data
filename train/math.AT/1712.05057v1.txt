Let \Sigma_g denote the closed orientable surface of genus g and fix an arbitrary simplicial triangulation of \Sigma_g. We construct and study a natural surjective group homomorphism from the surface braid group on n strands on \Sigma_g to the first singular homology group of \Sigma_g with integral coefficients. In particular, we show that the kernel of this homomorphism is generated by canonical braids which arise from the triangulation of \Sigma_g. This provides a simple description of natural subgroups of surface braid groups which are closely tied to the homology groups of the surfaces \Sigma_g.
