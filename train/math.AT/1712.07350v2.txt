Batyrev constructed a family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces dual to the first Chern class in toric Fano varieties. Using this construction, we introduce a family of Calabi-Yau manifolds whose SU-bordism classes generate the special unitary bordism ring \varOmega^{SU}\otimes\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]\cong\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}][y_{i}\colon i\ge 2]. We also describe explicit Calabi-Yau representatives for multiplicative generators of the SU-bordism ring in low dimensions.
