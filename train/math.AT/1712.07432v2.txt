We consider the category of perverse sheaves on a complex vector space smooth with respect to a stratification given by an arrangement of hyperplanes with real equations. As shown in an earlier wotk of two of the authors, this category can be described in terms of certain diagrams of vector spaces labelled by all the faces of the real arrangement (we call such diagrams hyperbolic sheaves). In this paper we calculate, in these terms, several fundamental operations of sheaf theory such as forming the space of vanishing cycles, specialization and the Fourier-Sato transform.
