A d-dimensional invertible topological field theory is a functor from the symmetric monoidal (\infty,n)-category of d-bordisms (embedded into \mathbb{R}^\infty and equipped with a tangential (X,\xi)-structure) which lands in the Picard subcategory of the target symmetric monoidal (\infty,n)-category. We classify these field theories in terms of the cohomology of the (n-d)-connective cover of the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum. This is accomplished by identifying the classifying space of the (\infty,n)-category of bordisms with \Omega^{\infty-n}MT\xi as an E_\infty-spaces. This generalizes the celebrated result of Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss in the case n=1, and of Bokstedt-Madsen in the n-uple case. We also obtain results for the (\infty,n)-category of d-bordisms embedding into a fixed ambient manifold M, generalizing results of Randal-Williams in the case n=1. We give two applications: (1) We completely compute all extended and partially extended invertible TFTs of dimension d \leq 4 with target a certain category of n-vector spaces (for n \leq 4), and (2) we use this to give a negative answer to a question raised by Gilmer and Masbaum.
