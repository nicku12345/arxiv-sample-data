We calculate the homotopy type of L_1L_{K(2)}S^0 and L_{K(1)}L_{K(2)}S^0 at the prime 2, where L_{K(n)} is localization with respect to Morava K-theory and L_1 localization with respect to 2-local K theory. In L_1L_{K(2)}S^0 we find all the summands predicted by the Chromatic Splitting Conjecture, but we find some extra summands as well. An essential ingredient in our approach is the analysis of the continuous group cohomology H^\ast_c(\mathbb{G}_2,E_0) where \mathbb{G}_2 is the Morava stabilizer group and E_0 = \mathbb{W}[[u_1]] is the ring of functions on the height 2 Lubin-Tate space. We show that the inclusion of the constants \mathbb{W} \to E_0 induces an isomorphism on group cohomology, a radical simplification.
