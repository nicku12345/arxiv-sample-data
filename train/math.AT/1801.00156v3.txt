We describe the topological Hochschild homology of the periodic complex K-theory spectrum, THH(KU), as a commutative KU-algebra: it is equivalent to KU[K(\mathbb{Z},3)] and to F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}}), where F is the free commutative KU-algebra functor on a KU-module. Moreover, F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}})\simeq KU \vee \Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}}, a square-zero extension. In order to prove these results, we first establish that topological Hochschild homology commutes, as an algebra, with localization at an element.   Then, we prove that THH^n(KU), the n-fold iteration of THH(KU), i.e. T^n\otimes KU, is equivalent to KU[G] where G is a certain product of integral Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, and to a free commutative KU-algebra on a rational KU-module. We prove that S^n \otimes KU is equivalent to KU[K(\mathbb{Z},n+2)] and to F(\Sigma^n KU_{\mathbb{Q}}). We describe the topological Andr\'e-Quillen homology of KU.
