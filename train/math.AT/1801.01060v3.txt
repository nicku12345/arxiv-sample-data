The commutative differential graded algebra A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X) of polynomial forms on a simplicial set X is a crucial tool in rational homotopy theory. In this note, we construct an integral version A^{\mathcal{I}}(X) of A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X). Our approach uses diagrams of chain complexes indexed by the category of finite sets and injections \mathcal{I} to model E_{\infty} differential graded algebras by strictly commutative objects, called commutative \mathcal{I}-dgas. We define a functor A^{\mathcal{I}} from simplicial sets to commutative \mathcal{I}-dgas and show that it is a commutative lift of the usual cochain algebra functor. In particular, it gives rise to a new construction of the E_{\infty} dga of cochains.   The functor A^{\mathcal{I}} shares many properties of A_{\mathrm{PL}}, and can be viewed as a generalization of A_{\mathrm{PL}} that works over arbitrary commutative ground rings. Working over the integers, a theorem by Mandell implies that A^{\mathcal{I}}(X) determines the homotopy type of X when X is a nilpotent space of finite type.
