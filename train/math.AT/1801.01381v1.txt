We follow the same technics we used before in \cite{AZ} of extending knot Floer homology to embedded graphs in a 3-manifold, by using the Kauffman topological invariant of embedded graphs by associating family of links and knots to a such graph by using some local replacements at each vertex in the graph. This new concept of Graph Floer homology constructed to be the sum of the knot Floer homologies of all the links and knots associated to this graph and the Euler characteristic is the sum of all the Alexander polynomials of links in the family. We constructed three pre-additive categories one for the graph under the cobordism and the other one is constructed in \cite{AMM} the last one is a category of Floer homologies for graph defined by Kauffman. Then we trying to study the functoriality of graphs category and their graph homologies in two ways, under cobordism and under branched cover, then we try to find the compatibility between them by the idea of Hilden and Little \cite{HL} by giving a notion of equivalence relation of branched coverings obtained by using cobordisms, and hence define a a functor from the graph Floer-Kauffman Homology category to the graph Khovanov-Kauffman Homology category.
