Homotopical geometry over differential operators is a convenient setting for a coordinate-free investigation of nonlinear partial differential equations modulo symmetries. One of the first issues one meets in the functor of points approach to homotopical \mathcal{D}-geometry, is the question of a model structure on the category \tt DGAlg(\mathcal{D}) of differential non-negatively graded \mathcal{O}-quasi-coherent sheaves of commutative algebras over the sheaf \mathcal{D} of differential operators of an appropriate underlying variety (X,\mathcal{O}). We define a cofibrantly generated model structure on \tt DGAlg(\mathcal{D}) via the definition of its weak equivalences and its fibrations, characterize the class of cofibrations, and build an explicit functorial `cofibration - trivial fibration' factorization. We then use the latter to get a functorial model categorical Koszul-Tate resolution for \mathcal{D}-algebraic `on-shell function' algebras (which contains the classical Koszul-Tate resolution). The paper is also the starting point for a homotopical \mathcal{D}-geometric Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.
