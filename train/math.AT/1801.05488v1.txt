It is shown that the Mayer-Vietoris sequence holds for the cohomology of complexes of Lie algebroids which are defined on simplicial complexes and satisfy the compatibility condition concerning restrictions to the faces of each simplex. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence will be obtained as a consequence of the extension lemma for piecewise smooth forms defined on complexes of Lie algebroids.
