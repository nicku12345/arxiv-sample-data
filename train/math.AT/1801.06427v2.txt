This note is on spherical classes in H_*(QS^0;k) when k=\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}/p with a special focus on the case of p=2 related to Curtis conjecture. We apply Freudenthal theorem to prove a vanishing result for the Hurewicz image of elements in {\pi_*^s} that factor through certain finite spectra. Either in p-local or p-complete settings, this immediately implies that elements of well known infinite families in {_p\pi_*^s}, such as Mahowaldean families, map trivially under the unstable Hurewicz homomorphism {_p\pi_*^s}\simeq{_p\pi_*}QS^0\to H_*(QS^0;\mathbb{Z}/p). We also observe that the image of the integral unstable Hurewicz homomorphism \pi_*^s\simeq\pi_*QS^0\to H_*(QS^0;\mathbb{Z}) when restricted to the submodule of decomposable elements, is given by \mathbb{Z}\{h(\eta^2),h(\nu^2),h(\sigma^2)\}. We apply this latter to completely determine spherical classes in H_*(\Omega^dS^{n+d};\mathbb{Z}/2) for certain values of n>0 and d>0; this verifies a Eccles' conjecture on spherical classes in H_*QS^n, n>0, on finite loop spaces associated to spheres.
