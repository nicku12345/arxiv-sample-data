We verify Curtis conjecture on a class of elements of {_2\pi_*^s} that satisfy a certain factorisation property. To be more precise, suppose f\in{_2\pi_n^s} pulls back to g\in{_2\pi_n^s}P through the Kahn-Priddy map \lambda:QP\to Q_0S^0 such that g projects nontrivially to an element g'\in{_2\pi_n^s}P_{t(n)} with h(g')=0 where h:{_2\pi_*}QP_k\to H_*QP_k is the unstable Hurewicz map, and t(n)=\lceil n/2\rceil. Then, mod out by elements of {_2\pi_*^s}\simeq{_2\pi_*}QS^0 satisfying this property, the Curtis conjecture on the image of h:{_2\pi_*}QS^0\to H_*QS^0 holds.
