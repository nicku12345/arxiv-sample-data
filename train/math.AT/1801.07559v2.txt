We take a direct approach to computing the orbits for the action of the automorphism group \mathbb{G}_2 of the Honda formal group law of height 2 on the associated Lubin-Tate rings R_2. We prove that (R_2/p)_{\mathbb{G}_2} \cong \mathbb{F}_p. The result is new for p=2 and p=3. For primes p\geq 5, the result is a consequence of computations of Shimomura and Yabe and has been reproduced by Kohlhaase using different methods.
