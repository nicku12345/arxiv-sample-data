Let P be an n-gon with n\geq3. There is a formal combinatorial A_\infty-coalgebra structure on cellular chains C_*(P) with non-vanishing higher order structure when n\geq5. If X_g is a closed compact surface of genus g\geq2 and P_g is a polygonal decomposition, the quotient map q:P_g\to X_g projects the formal A_\infty-coalgebra structure on C_*(P_g) to a quotient structure on C_*(X_g), which persists to homology H_{\ast}\left( X_g;\mathbb{Z}_{2}\right) , whose operations are determined by the quotient map q, and whose higher order structure is non-trivial if and only if X_g is orientable or unorientable with g\geq3. But whether or not the A_{\infty}-coalgebra structure on homology observed here is topologically invariant is an open question.
