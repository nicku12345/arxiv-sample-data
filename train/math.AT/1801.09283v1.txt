Let X be a higher rank symmetric space or a Bruhat-Tits building of dimension at least 2 such that the isometry group of X has property (T). We prove that for every torsion free lattice \Gamma\subset {\rm Isom} X any homology class in H_1(\Gamma\backslash X,\mathbb F_2) has a representative cycle of total length o_X({\rm Vol}(\Gamma\backslash X)). As an application we show that \dim_{\mathbb F_2} H_1(\Gamma\backslash X,\mathbb F_2)=o_X({\rm Vol}(\Gamma\backslash X)).
