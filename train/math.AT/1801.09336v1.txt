This paper concerns extension of maps using obstruction theory under a non classical viewpoint. It is given a classification of homotopy classes of maps and as an application it is presented a simple proof of a theorem by Adachi about equivalence of vector bundles. Also it is proved that, under certain conditions, two embeddings are homotopic up to surgery if and only if the respective normal bundles are SO-equivalent.
