The note identifies which which couniversal spaces have suspension spectra equivalent to commutative orthogonal ring G-spectra for a compact Lie group G. These are precisely those whose cofamily is closed under passage to finite index subgroups. Equivalently these are the couniversal spaces admitting an action of an equivariant E infinity operad.
