We study a naturally occurring E_{\infty}-subalgebra of the full E_2-Hochschild cochain complex arising from coherent cochains. For group rings and certain category algebras, these cochains detect H^*(B {\cal{C}}), the simplicial cohomology of the classifying space of the underlying group or category, \cal{C}. In this setting the simplicial cup product of cochains on B{\cal{C}} agrees with the Gerstenhaber product and Steenrod's cup-one product of cochains agrees with the pre-Lie product. We extend the idea of coherent cochains to algebras more general than category algebras and dub the resulting cochains autopoietic. Coefficients are from a commutative ring k with unit, not necessarily a field.
