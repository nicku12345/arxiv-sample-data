For each of the groups G = O(2), SU(2), U(2), we compute the integral and \mathbb{F}_2-cohomology rings of B_\text{com} G (the classifying space for commutativity of G), the action of the Steenrod algebra on the mod 2 cohomology, the homotopy type of E_\text{com} G (the homotopy fiber of the inclusion B_\text{com} G \to BG), and some low-dimensional homotopy groups of B_\text{com} G.
