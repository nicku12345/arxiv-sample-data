We extend the loop product and the loop coproduct to the mapping space from the k-dimensional sphere, or more generally from any k-manifold, to a k-connected space with finite dimensional rational homotopy group, k\geq 1. The key to extending the loop coproduct is the fact that the embedding M\rightarrow M^{S^{k-1}} is of "finite codimension" in a sense of Gorenstein spaces. Moreover, we prove the associativity, commutativity, and Frobenius compatibility of them.
