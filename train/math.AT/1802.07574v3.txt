We study higher Hochschild homology evaluated on wedges of circles, viewed as a functor on the category of free groups. The principal results use coefficients arising from square-zero extensions; this is motivated in part by work of Turchin and Willwacher in relation to hairy graph cohomology.   Working over a field of characteristic zero, achieve effective calculations of higher Hochschild homology, generalizing initial results of Turchin and Willwacher. This exploits exponential functors, which arise both in calculating higher Hochschild homology and in relation to polynomial functors on free groups. It is a crucial observation that these are related.   For the main cases of interest, the action of automorphisms of free groups on Hochschild homology factors across outer automorphisms. As the appropriate underlying framework, we introduce and make essential use of the category of outer functors, the full subcategory of functors on free groups on which inner automorphisms act trivially.
