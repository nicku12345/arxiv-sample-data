This paper studies the homotopy theory of parameterized spectrum objects in a model category from a global point of view. More precisely, for a model category \mathcal{M} satisfying suitable conditions, we construct a relative model category \mathcal{TM} \to \mathcal{M}, called the tangent bundle, whose fibers are models for spectra in the various over-categories of \mathcal{M}, and which presents the \infty-categorical tangent bundle. Moreover, the tangent bundle \mathcal{TM} inherits an enriched model structure when such a structure exists on \mathcal{M}. This additional structure is used in subsequent work to identify the tangent bundles of algebras over an operad and of enriched categories.
