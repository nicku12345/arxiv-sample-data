In this paper we study the homotopy theory of parameterized spectrum objects in the \infty-category of (\infty, 2)-categories, as well as the Quillen cohomology of an (\infty, 2)-category with coefficients in such a parameterized spectrum. More precisely, we construct an analogue of the twisted arrow category for an (\infty,2)-category \mathbb{C}, which we call its twisted 2-cell \infty-category. We then establish an equivalence between parameterized spectrum objects over \mathbb{C}, and diagrams of spectra indexed by the twisted 2-cell \infty-category of \mathbb{C}. Under this equivalence, the Quillen cohomology of \mathbb{C} with values in such a diagram of spectra is identified with the two-fold suspension of its inverse limit spectrum. As an application, we provide an alternative, obstruction-theoretic proof of the fact that adjunctions between (\infty,1)-categories are uniquely determined at the level of the homotopy (3, 2)-category of \mathrm{Cat}_{\infty}.
