We investigate certain adjunctions in derived categories of equivariant spectra, including a right adjoint to fixed points, a right adjoint to pullback by an isometry of universes, and a chain of two right adjoints to geometric fixed points. This leads to a variety of interesting other adjunctions, including a chain of 6 (sometimes 7) adjoints involving the restriction functor to a subgroup of a finite group on equivariant spectra indexed over the trivial universe.
