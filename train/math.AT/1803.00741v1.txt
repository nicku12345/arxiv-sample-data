In this paper, we show that every topological group is a strong small loop transfer space at the identity element. This implies that the quasitopological fundamental group of a connected locally path connected topological group is a topological group. Also, we show that every covering space of a connected locally path connected topological group is a topological group and its covering map is homomorphism.
