The Hirzebruch functional equation is \[   \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \prod_{j \ne i} { 1 \over f(z_j - z_i)} = c \] with constant c and initial conditions f(0)=0, f'(0)=1. In this paper we find all solutions of the Hirzebruch functional equation for n \leqslant 6 in the class of meromorphic functions and in the class of series. Previously, such results were known only for n \leqslant 4.   The Todd function is the function determining the two-parametric Todd genus (i.e. the \chi_{a,b}-genus). It gives a solution to the Hirzebruch functional equation for any n. The elliptic function of level N is the function determining the elliptic genus of level N. It gives a solution to the Hirzebruch functional equation for n divisible by N.   A series corresponding to a meromorphic function f with parameters in U \subset \mathbb{C}^k is a series with parameters in the Zariski closure of U in \mathbb{C}^k, such that for parameters in U it coincides with the series expansion at zero of f. The main results are:   Any series solution of the Hirzebruch functional equation for n = 5 corresponds to the Todd function or to the elliptic function of level 5.   Any series solution of the Hirzebruch functional equation for n = 6 corresponds to the Todd function or to the elliptic function of level 2, 3 or 6.   This gives a complete classification of complex genera that are fiber multiplicative with respect to \mathbb{C}P^{n-1} for n \leqslant 6.
