Strickland gave an interpretation of a quotient of the Morava E-theory of symmetric groups in terms of algebraic geometry. We identify an analogous quotient of the Morava E-theory of wreath products of symmetric groups with a tensor product of Strickland's quotients. This allows an algebro-geometric interpretation similar to Strickland's.
