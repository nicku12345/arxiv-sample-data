In the focus of our paper is a system of axioms that serves as a basis for introducing structural data for (2n,k)-manifolds M^{2n}, where M^{2n} is a smooth, compact 2n-dimensional manifold with a smooth effective action of the k-dimensional torus T^k. In terms of these data a construction of the model space \mathfrak{E} with an action of the torus T^k is given, such that there exists a T^k-equivariant homeomorphism \mathfrak{E}\to M^{2n}. This homeomorphism induces a homeomorphism \mathfrak{E}/T^k\to M^{2n}/T^k. The number d=n-k is called the complexity of an (2n,k)-manifold. Our theory comprises toric geometry and toric topology, where d=0. It is shown that the class of homogeneous spaces G/H of compact Lie groups, where rkG=rkH, contains (2n,k)-manifolds that have non zero complexity. The results are demonstrated on the complex Grassmann manifolds G_{k+1,q} with an effective action of the torus T^k.
