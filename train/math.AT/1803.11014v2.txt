Fix a prime p and consider the homotopy coequalizer of the identity map and any Adams operation \psi_q for any other prime q not equal to p, acting on p-local connective complex K-theory. In this article we establish a p-local version of the stable Adams conjecture that constructs a canonical extension of the stable J-homomorphism through this coequalizer, and taking values in the infinite delooping of the group like E_\infty-space of stable self homotopy equivalences of the p-local sphere. Our result can be seen as a p-local version of Friedlander's work on the infinite loop space Adams conjecture, which is a key ingredient in the proof of our result. As a powerful application, we settle the question on the height of higher associative structures on the mod p^k Moore spectrum M_p(k) induced by spherical fibrations (definition 1.1), where p is any odd prime. More precisely, for any odd prime p, we show that M_p(k) admits a A_n-structure induced by a spherical fibration if and only if n < p^k. We also prove a weaker result for p=2.
