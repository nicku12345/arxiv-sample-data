Let P_n be the graded polynomial algebra \mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n] with the degree of each generator x_i being 1, where \mathbb F_2 denote the prime field of two elements.   The Peterson hit problem is to find a minimal generating set for P_n regarded as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, \mathcal{A}. Equivalently, we want to find a vector space basis for \mathbb F_2 \otimes_{\mathcal A} P_n in each degree d. Such a basis may be represented by a list of monomials of degree d.   In this paper, we present a construction for the \mathcal A-generators of P_n and prove some properties of it. We also explicitly determine a basis of \mathbb F_2 \otimes_{\mathcal A} P_n for n = 5 and the degree d = 15.2^s - 5 with s an arbitrary positive integer. These results are used to verify Singer's conjecture for the fifth Singer algebraic transfer in respective degree.
