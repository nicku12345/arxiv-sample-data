Let G be a Lie group and H be a subgroup of it. We can construct a bisimplicial manifold NG(*) \rtimes NH(*) and the de Rham complex \Omega^*(NG(*) \rtimes NH(*)) on it. This complex is a triple complex and the cohomology of its total complex is isomorphic to H^*(B(G \rtimes H)). In this paper, we show that the total complex of the double complex \Omega^q(NG(*) \rtimes NH(*)) is isomorphic to the continuous cohomology H_c^*(G \rtimes H;S^q{\mathcal G}^* \otimes S^q{\mathcal H}^*) for any fixed q.
