Let C_2 be the cyclic group of order two. We present a structure theorem for the RO(C_2)-graded Bredon cohomology of C_2-spaces using coefficients in the constant Mackey functor \underline{\mathbb{F}_2}. We show that, as a module over the cohomology of the point, the RO(C_2)-graded cohomology of a finite C_2-CW complex decomposes as a direct sum of two basic pieces: shifted copies of the cohomology of a point and shifted copies of the cohomologies of spheres with the antipodal action. The shifts are by elements of RO(C_2) corresponding to actual (i.e. non-virtual) C_2-representations. This decomposition lifts to a splitting of genuine C_2-spectra.
