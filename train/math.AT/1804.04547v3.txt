Let X be a finite type A_n^2-polyhedron, n \geq 2. In this paper we study the quotient group \mathcal{E}(X)/\mathcal{E}_*(X), where \mathcal{E}(X) is the group of self-homotopy equivalences of X and \mathcal{E}_*(X) the subgroup of self-homotopy equivalences inducing the identity on the homology groups of X. We show that not every group can be realised as \mathcal{E}(X) or \mathcal{E}(X)/\mathcal{E}_*(X) for X an A_n^2-polyhedron, n\ge 3, and specific results are obtained for n=2.
