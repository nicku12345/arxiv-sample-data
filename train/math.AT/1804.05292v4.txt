We prove that the G-equivariant mod p Eilenberg--MacLane spectrum arises as an equivariant Thom spectrum for any finite, p-power cyclic group G, generalizing a result of Behrens and the second author in the case of the group C_2. We also establish a construction of \mathrm{H}\underline{\mathbb{Z}}_{(p)}, and prove intermediate results that may be of independent interest. Highlights include constraints on the Hurewicz images of equivariant spectra that admit norms, and an analysis of the extent to which the non-equivariant \mathrm{H}\mathbb{F}_p arises as the Thom spectrum of a more than double loop map.
