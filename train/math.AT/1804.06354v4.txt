We formulate the concept of minimal fibration in the context of fibrations in the model category \mathbf{S}^\mathcal{C} of \mathcal{C}-diagrams of simplicial sets, for a small index category \mathcal{C}. When \mathcal{C} is an EI-category satisfying some mild finiteness restrictions, we show that every fibration of \mathcal{C}-diagrams admits a well-behaved minimal model. As a consequence, we establish a classification theorem for fibrations in \mathbf{S}^\mathcal{C} over a constant diagram, generalizing the classification theorem of Barratt, Gugenheim, and Moore for simplicial fibrations.
