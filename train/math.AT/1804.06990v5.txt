In this paper, we generalize the combinatorial Laplace operator of Horak and Jost by introducing the \phi-weighted coboundary operator induced by a weight function \phi. Our weight function \phi is a generalization of Dawson's weighted boundary map. We show that our above-mentioned generalizations include new cases that are not covered by previous literature. Our definition of weighted Laplacian for weighted simplicial complexes is also applicable to weighted/unweighted graphs and digraphs.
