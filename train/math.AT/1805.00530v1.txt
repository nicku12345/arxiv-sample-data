In this paper, we set up a rational homotopy theory for operads in simplicial sets whose term of arity one is not necessarily reduced to an operadic unit, extending results obtained by the author in the book "Homotopy of operads and Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller groups". In short, we prove that the rational homotopy type of such an operad is determined by a cooperad in cochain differential graded algebras (a cochain Hopf dg-cooperad for short) as soon as the Sullivan rational homotopy theory works for the spaces underlying our operad (e.g. when these spaces are connected, nilpotent, and have finite type rational cohomology groups).
