In this paper we study homological stability for spaces {\rm Hom}(\mathbb{Z}^n,G) of pairwise commuting n-tuples in a Lie group G. We prove that for each n\geqslant 1, these spaces satisfy rational homological stability as G ranges through any of the classical sequences of compact, connected Lie groups, or their complexifications. We prove similar results for rational equivariant homology, for character varieties, and for the infinite-dimensional analogues of these spaces, {\rm Comm}(G) and {\rm B_{com}} G, introduced by Cohen-Stafa and Adem-Cohen-Torres-Giese respectively. In addition, we show that the rational homology of the space of unordered commuting n-tuples in a fixed group G stabilizes as n increases. Our proofs use the theory of representation stability - in particular, the theory of {\rm FI}_W-modules developed by Church-Ellenberg-Farb and Wilson. In all of the these results, we obtain specific bounds on the stable range, and we show that the homology isomorphisms are induced by maps of spaces.
