The Reeb space of a generic map is the space of all connected components of preimages of the map and a fundamental and useful tool in the theory of Morse functions and higher dimensional versions and application to geometry of manifolds. Reeb spaces are polyhedra compatible with natural simplicial structures of the manifolds in considerable cases. For example, for Morse functions, fold maps, and proper stable maps, which are useful and fundamental tools in these studies, the Reeb spaces are polyhedra.   In 2010s, Hiratuka and Saeki found that the top-dimensional homology group of the Reeb space does not vanish for a smooth map such as a proper stable map having an preimage of a regular value containing a component which is not (oriented) null-cobordant, and recently the author found some extended versions of this fact formulating and using cobordism-like groups of equivalence classes of smooth and closed manifolds.   In this paper, we show similar facts in cases where manifolds and preimages of maps of regular values may have additional algebraic topological or differential topological structures other than differentiable structures and orientations. We also give some explicit applications of the result where preimages of regular values have spin structures, structures of framed manifolds, and so on, for example.
