For a connected CW-complex, we let SNT(X) be the set of all homotopy types [Y] such that the Postnikov approximations X^{(n)} and Y^{(n)} of X and Y, respectively, are homotopy equivalent for all positive integers n. In 1992, McGibbon and M{\o}ller (\cite[page 287]{MM}) raised the following question: Is SNT(\Sigma \mathbb C P^\infty) = * or not? In this article, we give an answer to the more generalized version of this query: The set of all the same n-types of the suspended wedge sum of the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces of various types of both even and odd integers is the set which consists of only one element as a single homotopy type of itself.
