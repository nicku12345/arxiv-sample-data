In this paper, we construct a double chain complex generated by certain graphs and a chain map from that to the Chevalley-Eilenberg double complex of the dgl of symplectic derivations on a free dgl. It is known that the target of the map is related to characteristic classes of fibrations. We can describe some characteristic classes of fibrations whose fiber is a 1-punctured even-dimensional manifold by linear combinations of graphs though the cohomology of the dgl of derivations.
