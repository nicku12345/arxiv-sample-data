There are only 10 Euclidean forms, that is flat closed three dimensional manifolds: six are orientable and four are non-orientable. The aim of this paper is to describe all types of n-fold coverings over orientable Euclidean manifolds \mathcal{G}_{2} and \mathcal{G}_{4}, and calculate the numbers of non-equivalent coverings of each type. We classify subgroups in the fundamental groups \pi_1(\mathcal{G}_{2}) and \pi_1(\mathcal{G}_{4}) up to isomorphism and calculate the numbers of conjugated classes of each type of subgroups for index n. The manifolds \mathcal{G}_{2} and \mathcal{G}_{4} are uniquely determined among the others orientable forms by their homology groups H_1(\mathcal{G}_{2})=\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z} and H_1(\mathcal{G}_{4})=\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}.
