For G a compact Lie group, toral G-spectra are those rational G-spectra whose geometric isotropy consists of subgroups of a maximal torus of G. The homotopy category of rational toral G-spectra is a retract of the category of all rational G-spectra.   In this paper we show that the abelian category defined by the second author in previous work gives an algebraic model for the toral part of rational G-spectra. This is a major step in establishing an algebraic model for all rational G-spectra, for any compact Lie group G.
