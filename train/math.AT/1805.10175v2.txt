Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. Carlsson showed the existence of minimal models of certain semifree differential graded k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]-modules. Here we give an explicit construction of these minimal models without the semifreeness condition. We also prove Carlsson's rank conjecture when the degrees of all nonzero homology groups of a differential graded module have the same parity. Dually, we construct minimal models of chain complexes of Borel constructions of spaces with a free (\mathbb{Z}/2)^r-action. These minimal models are called minimal Hirsch-Brown models by Allday-Puppe. Puppe also showed that putting certain multiplicative structures on these minimal models could be useful to improve known results on related conjectures. Here we give our construction of these models using operadic language. This enables us to put multiplicative structures on these models.
