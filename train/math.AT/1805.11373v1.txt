Let X(Q,\Lambda) be a quasitoric manifold associated to a simple convex polytope Q and characteristic function \Lambda. Let T\cong (\mathbb{S}^1)^n denote the compact n-torus acting on X=X(Q,\Lambda). The main aim of this article is to give a presentation of the T-equivariant K-ring of X, as a Stanley-Reisner ring over K^*(pt). We also derive the presentation for the ordinary K-ring of X.
