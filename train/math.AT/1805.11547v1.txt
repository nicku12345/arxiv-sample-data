This survey describes some useful properties of the local homology of abstract simplicial complexes. Although the existing literature on local homology is somewhat dispersed, it is largely dedicated to the study of manifolds, submanifolds, or samplings thereof. While this is a vital perspective, the focus of this survey is squarely on the local homology of abstract simplicial complexes. Our motivation comes from the needs of the analysis of hypergraphs and graphs. In addition to presenting many classical facts in a unified way, this survey presents a few new results about how local homology generalizes useful tools from graph theory. The survey ends with a statistical comparison of graph invariants with local homology.
