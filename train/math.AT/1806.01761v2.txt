Let T be a compact torus and X be a a finite T-CW complex (e.g. a compact T-manifold). In earlier work, the second author introduced a functor which assigns to X a so called GKM-sheaf \mathcal{F}_X whose ring of global sections H^0(\mathcal{F}_X) is isomorphic to the equivariant cohomology H^*_T(X) whenever X is equivariantly formal (meaning that H^*_T(X) is a free module over H^*(BT)). In the current paper we prove more generally that H^0(\mathcal{F}_X) \cong H^*_T(X) if and only if H_T^*(X) is reflexive, and find a geometric interpretation of the higher cohomology H^n(\mathcal{F}_X) for n \geq 1.
