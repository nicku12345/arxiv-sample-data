We use Galois group actions on \'etale cohomology to prove results of formality for dg-operads and dg-algebras with torsion coefficients. Our theory applies, among other related constructions, to the dg-operad of singular chains on the operad of little disks and to the dg-algebra of singular cochains on the configuration space of points in the complex space. The formality that we obtain is only up to a certain degree, which depends on the cardinality of the field of coefficients.
