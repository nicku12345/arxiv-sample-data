We consider the `unstable Boardman map' (homomorphism if k>0) b:\pi^{m+k}\Sigma^k\Omega^lS^{n+l}\simeq[\Omega^lS^{n+l},\Omega^kS^{m+k}]\longrightarrow \mathrm{Hom}(H_*\Omega^lS^{n+l},H_*\Omega^kS^{m+k}) defined by h(f)=f_*. We work at the prime 2, with k=0, and determine the image for various in the following cases : (1) m=n and l>0 arbitrary; (2) m>n and l=1. We observe that in most of the cases the image is trivial with the exceptions corresponding to the cases when either there is a (commutative) H-space structure on S^n or there is a Hopf invariant one element.
