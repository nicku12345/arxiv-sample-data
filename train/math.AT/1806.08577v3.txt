In this paper, we study conditions for extending Quillen model category properties , between two symmetric monoidal categories, to their associated category of symmetric sequences and of operads.   Given a Quillen equivalence \lambda: \mathcal{C}=Ch_{\Bbbk,t} \leftrightarrows \mathcal{D}: R, so that \mathcal{D} is any symmetric monoidal category and the adjoint pair (\lambda, R) is weak monoidal, we prove that the categories of connected operads Op_\mathcal{C} and Op_\mathcal{D} are Quillen equivalent. This expands an analogous result of Schwede-Shipley(\cite{SS03}) when we replace these categories of operads with the sub-categories of \mathcal{C}-Monoid and \mathcal{D}-monoid.
