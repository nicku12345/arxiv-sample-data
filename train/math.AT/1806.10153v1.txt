The Cantor-Bendixson rank of a topological space X is a measure of the complexity of the topology of X. The Cantor-Bendixson rank is most interesting when the space is profinite: Hausdorff, compact and totally disconnected. We will see that the injective dimension of the Abelian category of sheaves of rational vector spaces over a profinite space is determined by the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the space.
