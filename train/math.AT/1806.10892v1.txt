This paper is a continuation of the version I of the same title, which intends to clarify and expand the results in the last chapter of `the green book' by the second author. In particular, we give the stable homotopy groups of p-local spectra T(m)_{(1)} for m>0. This is a part of a program to compute the p-components of \pi_{*}(S^{0}) through dimension 2p^{4}(p-1) for p>2. We will refer to the results from the version I freely as if they were in the first four sections of this paper, which begins with section 5.
