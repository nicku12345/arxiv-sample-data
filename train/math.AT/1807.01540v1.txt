The Euler characteristic is an invariant of a topological space that in a precise sense captures its canonical notion of size, akin to the cardinality of a set. The Euler characteristic is closely related to the homology of a space, as it can be expressed as the alternating sum of its Betti numbers, whenever the sum is well-defined. Thus, one says that homology categorifies the Euler characteristic. In his work on the generalisation of cardinality-like invariants, Leinster introduced the magnitude of a metric space, a real number that gives the "effective number of points" of the space. Recently, Leinster and Shulman introduced a homology theory for metric spaces, called magnitude homology, which categorifies the magnitude of a space. When studying a metric space, one is often only interested in the metric space up to a rescaling of the distance of the points by a non-negative real number. The magnitude function describes how the effective number of points changes as one scales the distance, and it is completely encoded in the Euler characteristic of magnitude homology. When studying a finite metric space in topological data analysis using persistent homology, one approximates the space through a nested sequence of simplicial complexes so as to recover topological information about the space by studying the homology of this sequence. Here we relate magnitude homology and persistent homology as two different ways of computing homology of filtered simplicial sets.
