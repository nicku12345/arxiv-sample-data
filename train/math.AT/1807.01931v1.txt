Let M be an orientable, simply-connected, closed, non-spin 4-manifold and let \mathcal{G}_k(M) be the gauge group of the principal G-bundle over M with second Chern class k\in\mathbb{Z}. It is known that the homotopy type of \mathcal{G}_k(M) is determined by the homotopy type of \mathcal{G}_k(\mathbb{CP}^2). In this paper we investigate properties of \mathcal{G}_k(\mathbb{CP}^2) when G = SU(n) that partly classify the homotopy types of the gauge groups.
