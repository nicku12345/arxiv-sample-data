In a 2009 paper, Dave Benson gave a description in purely algebraic terms of the mod p homology of \Omega(BG^\wedge_p), when G is a finite group, BG^\wedge_p is the p-completion of its classifying space, and \Omega(BG^\wedge_p) is the loop space of BG^\wedge_p. The main purpose of this work is to shed new light on Benson's result by extending it to a more general setting. As a special case, we show that if \mathcal{C} is a small category, |\mathcal{C}| is the geometric realization of its nerve, R is a commutative ring, and |\mathcal{C}|^+_R is a "plus construction" for |\mathcal{C}| in the sense of Quillen (taken with respect to R-homology), then H_*(\Omega(|\mathcal{C}|^+_R);R) can be described as the homology of a chain complex of projective R\mathcal{C}-modules satisfying a certain list of algebraic conditions that determine it uniquely up to chain homotopy. Benson's theorem is now the case where \mathcal{C} is the category of a finite group G, R=\mathbb{F}_p for some prime p, and |\mathcal{C}|^+_R=BG^\wedge_p.
