We offer a complete description of THH(E(2)) under the assumption that the Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(2) at a chosen odd prime carries an E_\infty-structure. We also place THH(E(2)) in a cofiber sequence E(2) \rightarrow THH(E(2))\rightarrow \overline{THH}(E(2)) and describe \overline{THH}(E(2)) under the assumption that E(2) is an E_3-ring spectrum. We state general results about the K(i)-local behaviour of THH(E(n)) for all n and 0 \leq i \leq n. In particular, we compute K(i)_*THH(E(n)).
