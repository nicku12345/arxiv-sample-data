We investigate a new case of rigidity in stable homotopy theory which is the rigidity of the K(1)-local stable homotopy category \mathrm{Ho}(L_{K(1)}\mathrm{Sp}) at p=2. In other words, we show that recovering higher homotopy information by just looking at the triangulated structure of \mathrm{Ho}(L_{K(1)}\mathrm{Sp}) is possible, which is a property that only few interesting stable model categories are known to possess.
