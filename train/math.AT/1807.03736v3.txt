Commutative K-theory, a cohomology theory built from spaces of commuting matrices, has been explored in recent work of Adem, G\'{o}mez, Gritschacher, Lind, and Tillman. In this article, we use unstable methods to construct explicit representatives for the real commutative K-theory classes on surfaces. These classes arise from commutative O(2)-valued cocycles, and are analyzed via the point-wise inversion operation on commutative cocycles.
