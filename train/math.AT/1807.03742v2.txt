In the present paper we construct two new explicit complex bordisms between any two projective bundles over \mathbb{C} P^1 of the same complex dimension, including the Milnor hypersurface H_{1,n} and \mathbb{C} P^1\times \mathbb{C} P^{n-1}. These constructions reduce the bordism problem to the null-bordism of some projective bundle over \mathbb{C} P^1 with the non-standard stably complex structure.
