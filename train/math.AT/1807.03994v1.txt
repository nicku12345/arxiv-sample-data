In arXiv:1711.10132 a new approximating invariant {\mathsf{TC}}^{\mathcal{D}} for topological complexity was introduced called \mathcal{D}-topological complexity. In this paper, we explore more fully the properties of {\mathsf{TC}}^{\mathcal{D}} and the connections between {\mathsf{TC}}^{\mathcal{D}} and invariants of Lusternik-Schnirelmann type. We also introduce a new \mathsf{TC}-type invariant \widetilde{\mathsf{TC}} that can be used to give an upper bound for \mathsf{TC}, \mathsf{TC}(X)\le {\mathsf{TC}}^{\mathcal{D}}(X) + \left\lceil \frac{2\dim X -k}{k+1}\right\rceil, where X is a finite dimensional simplicial complex with k-connected universal cover \tilde X. The above inequality is a refinement of an estimate given by Dranishnikov.
