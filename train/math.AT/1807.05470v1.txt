We continue the development of the computability of the second real Johnson-Wilson theory. As ER(2) is not complex orientable, this gives some difficulty even with basic spaces. In this paper we compute the second real Johnson-Wilson theory for products of infinite complex projective spaces and for the classifying spaces for the unitary groups.
