For any object A in a simplicial model category C, we construct a topological space \^A which classifies linear functors whose value on an open ball is equivalent to A. More precisely for a manifold M, and O(M) its poset category of open sets, weak equivalence classes of such functors O(M) ---> C are shown to be in bijection with homotopy classes of maps [M,\^A]. The result extends to higher degree homogeneous functors. At the end we explain a connection to a classification result of Michael Weiss.
