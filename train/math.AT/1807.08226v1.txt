We study the notion of a bifibration in simplicial sets which generalizes the classical notion of two-sided discrete fibration studied in category theory. If A and B are simplicial sets we equip the category of simplicial sets over A\times B with the structure of a model category for which the fibrant objects are the bifibrations from A to B. We also equip the category of correspondences of simplicial sets from A to B with the structure of a model category. We describe several Quillen equivalences relating these model structure with the covariant model structure on the category of simplicial sets over B^{\mathrm{op}}\times A.
