The topological complexity {\sf TC}(X) is a homotopy invariant of a topological space X, motivated by robotics, and providing a measure of the navigational complexity of X. The topological complexity of a connected sum of real projective planes, that is, a high genus nonorientable surface, is known to be maximal. We use algebraic tools to show that the analogous result holds for connected sums of higher dimensional real projective spaces.
