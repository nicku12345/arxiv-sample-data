We explain our previous results about Hochschild actions [Ka07,Ka08a] pertaining in particular to the co-product which appeared in a different form in [GH09] and provide a fresh look at the results.   We briefly recall the general action and specify to the mentioned co--product. We give detailed background material on loop spaces, Hochschild complexes and dualizations, and discuss details and extensions of these techniques which work for all operations of [Ka07,Ka08a]. We also discuss a ``time reversal'' duality and prove that the assumption of commutativity, made out of convenience in [Ka08[, is not needed.
