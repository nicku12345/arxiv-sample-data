We compute the additive structure of the \mathrm{RO}(C_n)-graded Bredon equivariant cohomology of the equivariant classifying space B_{C_n}\mathrm{SU}(2), for any n that is either prime or a product of distinct odd primes, and we also compute its multiplicative structure for n=2. In particular, as an algebra over the cohomology of a point, we show that the cohomology of B_{C_2}\mathrm{SU}(2) is generated by two elements subject to a single relation: writing \sigma for the sign representation of C_2 in \mathrm{RO}(C_2), the generators are an element c in dimension 4\sigma and an element C in dimension 4+4\sigma, satisfying the relation c^2 = \epsilon^4 c + \xi^2 C, where \epsilon and \xi are elements of the cohomology of a point. Throughout, we take coefficients in the Burnside ring Mackey functor A.   The key tools used are equivariant "even-dimensional freeness" and "multiplicative comparison" theorems for G-cell complexes, both proven by Lewis in [Lew88] and subsequently refined by Shulman in [Shu10], and with the former theorem extended by Basu and Ghosh in [BG16]. The latter theorem enables us to compute the multiplicative structure of the cohomology of B_{C_2}\mathrm{SU}(2) by embedding it in a direct sum of cohomology rings whose structure is more easily understood. Both theorems require the cells of the G-cell complex to be attached in a well-behaved order, and a significant step in our work is to give B_{C_n}\mathrm{SU}(2) a satisfactory C_n-cell complex structure.
