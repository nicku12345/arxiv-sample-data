We introduce a finitely presented prop \mathcal{S} = \{\mathcal{S}(n,m)\} in the category of differential graded modules whose associated operad U(\mathcal{S})=\{\mathcal{S}(1,m)\} is a model for the E_\infty-operad. This finite presentation allows us to describe a natural E_\infty-coalgebra structure on the chains of any simplicial set in terms of only three maps: the Alexander-Whitney diagonal, the augmentation map, and an algebraic version of the join of simplices. The first appendix connects our construction to the Surjection operad of McClure-Smith and Berger-Fresse. The second establishes a duality between the join and AW maps for augmented and non-augmented simplicial sets. A follow up paper constructs a prop corresponding to \mathcal{S} in the category of CW-complexes.
