We study finiteness (and vanishing) properties of the higher order degrees associated to complements of complex affine plane curves with mild singularities at infinity. Our results impose new obstructions on the class of groups that can be realized as fundamental groups of affine plane curve complements. We also clarify the relationship between the higher order degrees and the multivariable Alexander polynomial of a non-irreducible plane curve.
