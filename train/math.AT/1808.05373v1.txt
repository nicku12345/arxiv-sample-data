Extending work of many authors we calculate the higher simple structure sets of lens spaces in the sense of surgery theory in the case when the fundamental group has order a power of 2. As a corollary we also obtain a calculation of the simple structure set of the products of lens spaces and spheres of dimension grater or equal to 3 in this case.
