We define a reduced \infty-operad \mathcal{P} to be d-connected if the spaces \mathcal{P}\left(n\right), of n-ary operations, are d-connected for all n\ge0. Let \mathcal{P} and \mathcal{Q} be two reduced \infty-operads. We prove that if \mathcal{P} is d_{1}-connected and \mathcal{Q} is d_{2}-connected, then their Boardman-Vogt tensor product \mathcal{P}\otimes\mathcal{Q} is \left(d_{1}+d_{2}+2\right)-connected. We consider this to be a natural \infty-categorical generalization of the classical Eckmann-Hilton argument.
