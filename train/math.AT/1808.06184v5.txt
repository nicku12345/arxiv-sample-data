In this paper, we develop and study the theory of weighted fundamental groups of weighted simplicial complexes. When all weights are 1, the weighted fundamental group reduces to the usual fundamental group as a special case. We also study weighted versions of classical theorems like van Kampen's theorem. In addition, we also investigate the abelianization, lower central series and applications of weighted fundamental groups.
