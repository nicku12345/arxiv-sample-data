We introduce a new algorithm for the structural analysis of finite abstract simplicial complexes based on local homology. Through an iterative and top-down procedure, our algorithm computes a stratification \pi of the poset P of simplices of a simplicial complex K, such that for each strata P_{\pi=i} \subset P, P_{\pi=i} is maximal among all open subposets U \subset \overline{P_{\pi=i}} in its closure such that the restriction of the local \mathbb{Z}-homology sheaf of \overline{P_{\pi=i}} to U is locally constant. Passage to the localization of P dictated by \pi then attaches a canonical stratified homotopy type to K.   Using \infty-categorical methods, we first prove that the proposed algorithm correctly computes the canonical stratification of a simplicial complex; along the way, we prove a few general results about sheaves on posets and the homotopy types of links that may be of independent interest. We then present a pseudocode implementation of the algorithm, with special focus given to the case of dimension \leq 3, and show that it runs in polynomial time. In particular, an n-dimensional simplicial complex with size s and n\leq3 can be processed in O(s^2) time or O(s) given one further assumption on the structure. Processing Delaunay triangulations of 2-spheres and 3-balls provides experimental confirmation of this linear running time.
