We show that for any face F of a simple polytope P the canonical equivariant homeomorphisms h_P:\,\mathcal Z_P\to\mathcal Z_{K_P} and h_F:\,\mathcal Z_F\to\mathcal Z_{K_F} are linked in a pentagonal commutative diagram with the maps of moment-angle manifolds and moment-angle-complexes, induced by a face embedding i_{F,P}:\,F\to P and a simplicial embedding \Phi_{F,P}:\,K_F\to K_{F,P}\to K_P, where K_{F,P} is the full subcomplex of K_P on the same vertex set as \Phi_{F,P}(K_F). We introduce the explicit constructions of the maps i_{F,P}, \Phi_{F,P} and show that a polytope P is flag if and only if the induced embedding \hat{i}_{F,P}:\,\mathcal Z_{F}\to\mathcal Z_P of moment-angle manifolds has a retraction and thus induces a split ring epimorphism in cohomology for any face F\subset P. As the applications of these results we obtain the sequences \{P^n\} of flag simple polytopes such that there exists a nontrivial k-fold Massey product in H^*(\mathcal Z_{P^n}) with k\to\infty as n\to\infty and, moreover, the existence of a nontrivial k-fold Massey product in H^*(\mathcal Z_{P^n}) implies existence of a nontrivial k-fold Massey product in H^*(\mathcal Z_{P^l}) for any l>n.
