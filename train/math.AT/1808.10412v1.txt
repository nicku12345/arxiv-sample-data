We introduce a computationally tractable way to describe the \mathbb Z-homotopy fixed points of a C_{n}-spectrum E, producing a genuine C_{n} spectrum E^{hn\mathbb Z} whose fixed and homotopy fixed points agree and are the \mathbb Z-homotopy fixed points of E. These form a piece of a contravariant functor from the divisor poset of n to genuine C_{n}-spectra, and when E is an N_{\infty}-ring spectrum, this functor lifts to a functor of N_{\infty}-ring spectra.   For spectra like the Real Johnson--Wilson theories or the norms of Real bordism, the slice spectral sequence provides a way to easily compute the RO(G)-graded homotopy groups of the spectrum E^{hn\mathbb Z}, giving the homotopy groups of the \mathbb Z-homotopy fixed points. For the more general spectra in the contravariant functor, the slice spectral sequences interpolate between the one for the norm of Real bordism and the especially simple \mathbb Z-homotopy fixed point case, giving us a family of new tools to simplify slice computations.
