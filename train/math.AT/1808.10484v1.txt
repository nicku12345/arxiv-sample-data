We construct a natural bijective correspondence between equivalence classes of Pin^- structures on a compact simplicial n-manifold M^n, possibly with boundary, and \mathbb{Z}/4-valued 'quadratic functions' Q defined on degree n-1 relative \mathbb{Z}/2 cocycles, Q \colon Z^{n-1}(M^n, \partial M^n ; \mathbb{Z} /2) \to \mathbb{Z}/4. The 'quadratic' property of Q(p+q) and the values Q(dc) on coboundaries are expressed in terms of higher \cup_i products of Steenrod. For n = 2 the results extend old results relating Pin^- structures on closed surfaces to quadratic refinements of the cup product pairing on H^1(M^n ; \mathbb{Z} /2). In the oriented case, that is, for Spin manifolds, the results extend results of Kapustin, see arXiv:1505.05856v2, and results in our previous paper on the Pontrjagin dual 4-dimensional Spin bordism, see arXiv:1803.08147. The extension of those results to Pin^- manifolds in this paper required a different approach, involving some stable homotopy theory of Postnikov towers.
