A configuration space of intervals in \mathbb R^1 with partially summable labels is constructed. It is a kind of an extension of the configuration space with partially summable labels constructed by the second author and at the same time a generalization of the configuration space of intervals with labels in a based space constructed by the first author. An approximation theorem of the preceding configuration space is generalized to our case. When partially summable labels are given by a partial abelian monoid M, we prove that it is weakly homotopy equivalent to the space of based loops on the classifying space of M under some assumptions on M.
