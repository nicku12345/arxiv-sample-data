In this paper, we consider an obstruction-theoretical construction of characteristic classes of fiber bundles by simplicial method. We can get a certain obstruction class for a deformation of C_\infty-algebra models of fibers and a characteristic map from the exterior algebra of a vector space of derivations. Applying this construction for a surface bundle, we obtain the Euler class of a sphere bundle and the Morita-Miller-Mumford classes of a bundle with positive genus fiber.
