We study a connection between a multivariable version of the Goodwillie-Weiss' calculus of functors and derived mapping spaces of k-fold bimodules over a family of operads. As our main application, under the assumption d_{i}+3\leq n for all i\in \{1,\ldots,k\}, we produce explicit deloopings of high-dimensional spaces of string links modulo immersions from \sqcup_{i}\mathbb{R}^{d_{i}} to \mathbb{R}^{n} and their polynomial approximations.
