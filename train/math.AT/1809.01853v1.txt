In the present paper, by using the colored version of the Koszul duality, the concept of a differential module with \infty-simplicial faces is introduced. The homotopy invariance of the structure of a differential module with \infty-simplicial faces is proved. The relationships between differential modules with \infty-simplicial faces and A_\infty-algebras are established. The notion of a chain realization of a differential module with \infty-simplicial faces and the concept of a tensor product of differential modules with \infty-simplicial faces are introduced. It is proved that for an arbitrary A_\infty-algebra the chain realization of the tensor differential module with \infty-simplicial faces, which corresponds to this A_\infty-algebra, and the B-construction of this A_\infty-algebra are isomorphic differential coalgebras.
