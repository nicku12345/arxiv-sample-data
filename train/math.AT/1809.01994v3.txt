We suggest interpreting a certain braided monoidal topological category \Cc of finite subsets of \C as analogous to a (hypothetical) category of modules over the punctured \F_1-disk, with the classical Burau representation of the planar mapping-class groups as a monoidal functor to the symmetric monoidal category of \Z[q,q^{-1}] - modules. The {\bf writhe} of a mapping class or braid, or more generally of a framed oriented tangle, can then be interpreted as a kind of nonlocal topological charge, defining a monoidal subcategory with morphisms of writhe zero, underlying Hopkins and Mahowald's interpretation of the integral Eilenberg - Mac Lane spectrum H\Z as a Thom spectrum.
