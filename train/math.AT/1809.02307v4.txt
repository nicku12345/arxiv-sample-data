The Dold manifold  P(m,n) is the quotient of S^m \times \mathbb{C}P^n by the free involution that acts antipodally on  S^m  and by complex conjugation on  \mathbb{C}P^n . In this paper, we investigate free actions of finite groups on products of Dold manifolds. We show that if a finite group  G  acts freely and mod 2 cohomologically trivially on a finite-dimensional CW-complex homotopy equivalent to {\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{k} P(2m_i,n_i)}, then G\cong (\mathbb{Z}_2)^l for some l\leq k. This is achieved by first proving a similar assertion for  \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{k} S^{2m_i} \times \mathbb{C} P^{n_i} .   We also determine the possible mod 2 cohomology algebra of orbit spaces of arbitrary free involutions on Dold manifolds, and give an application to  \mathbb{Z}_2 -equivariant maps.
