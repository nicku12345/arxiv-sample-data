In this paper we define a family of theories, quasi-theories, motivated by quasi-elliptic cohomology. They can be defined from constant loop spaces. With them, the constructions on certain theories can be made in a neat way, such as those on generalized Tate K-theories. We set up quasi-theories and discuss their properties.
