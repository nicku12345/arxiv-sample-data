We study bicolored configurations of points in the Euclidean n-space that are constrained to remain either inside or outside a fixed Euclidean m-subspace, with n - m \ge 2. We define a higher-codimensional variant of the Swiss-Cheese operad, called the complementarily constrained disks operad \mathsf{CD}_{mn}, associated to such configurations. The operad \mathsf{CD}_{mn} is weakly equivalent to the operad of locally constant factorization algebras on the stratified space \{\mathbb{R}^{m} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}\}. We prove that this operad is formal over \mathbb{R}.
