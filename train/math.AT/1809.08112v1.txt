The classical Hopf invariant is an invariant of homotopy classes of maps from S^{4n-1}  to S^{2n}, and is an important invariant in homotopy theory. The goal of this paper is to use the Koszul duality theory for E_n-operads to define a generalization of the classical Hopf invariant. One way of defining the classical Hopf invariant is by defining a pairing between the cohomology of the associative bar construction on the cochains of a space X and the homotopy groups of X. In this paper we will give a generalization of the classical Hopf invariant by defining a pairing between the cohomology of the E_n-bar construction on the cochains of X and the homotopy groups of X. This pairing gives us a set of invariants of homotopy classes of maps from S^m to a simplicial set X, this pairing can detect more homotopy classes of maps than the classical Hopf invariant.   The second part of the paper is devoted to combining the E_n-Hopf invariants with the Koszul duality theory for E_n-operads to get a relation between the E_n-Hopf invariants of a space X and the E_{n+1}-Hopf invariants of the suspension of X. This is done by studying the suspension morphism for the E_\infty-operad, which is a morphism from the E_{\infty}-operad to the desuspension of the E_\infty-operad. We show that it induces a functor from E_\infty-algebras to E_\infty-algebras, which has the property that it sends an E_\infty-model for a simplicial set X to an E_\infty-model for the suspension of X.   We use this result to give a relation between the E_n-Hopf invariants of maps from S^m into X and the E_{n+1}-Hopf invariants of maps from S^{m+1} into the suspension of X. One of the main results we show here, is that this relation can be used to define invariants of stable homotopy classes of maps.
