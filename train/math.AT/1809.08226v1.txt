The fixed point spectra of Morava E-theory E_n under the action of finite subgroups of the Morava Stabilizer group \mathbb{G}_n and their K(n)-local Spanier--Whitehead duals can be used to approximate the K(n)-local sphere in certain cases. For any finite subgroup F of the height 2 Morava Stabilizer group at p=2 we prove that the K(2)-local Spanier--Whitehead dual of the spectrum E_2^{hF} is \Sigma^{44}E_2^{hF}. These results are analogous to the height 2 and p=3 case where DE_2^{hF}=\Sigma^{44}E_2^{hF} for finite subgroups F<\mathbb{G}_2. The main computational tool we use in proving this result is the topological duality resolution spectral sequence for the spectrum E_2^{h\mathbb{S}_2^1} at p=2.
