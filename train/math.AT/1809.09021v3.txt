We study certain topological problems that are inspired by applications to autonomous robot manipulation. Consider a continuous map f\colon X\to Y, where f can be a kinematic map from the configuration space X to the working space Y of a robot arm or a similar mechanism. Then one can associate to f a number \mathrm{TC}(f), which is, roughly speaking, the minimal number of continuous rules that are necessary to construct a complete manipulation algorithm for the device. Examples show that \mathrm{TC}(f) is very sensitive to small perturbations of f and that its value depends heavily on the singularities of f. This fact considerably complicates the computations, so we focus here on estimates of \mathrm{TC}(f) that can be expressed in terms of homotopy invariants of spaces X and Y, or that are valid if f satisfy some additional assumptions like, for example, being a fibration.   Some of the main results are the derivation of a general upper bound for \mathrm{TC}(f), invariance of \mathrm{TC}(f) with respect to deformations of the domain and codomain, proof that \mathrm{TC}(f) is a FHE-invariant, and the description of a cohomological lower bound for \mathrm{TC}(f). Furthermore, if f is a fibration we derive more precise estimates for \mathrm{TC}(f) in terms of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and the topological complexity of X and Y. We also obtain some results for the important special case of covering projections.
