We investigate the exponents of the total Cohen groups [\Omega(\mathbb S^{r+1}), \Omega(Y)] for any r\ge 1. In particular, we show that for p\ge 3, the p-primary exponents of [\Omega(\mathbb S^{r+1}), \Omega(\mathbb S^{2n+1})] and [\Omega(\mathbb S^{r+1}), \Omega(\mathbb S^{2n})] coincide with the p-primary homotopy exponents of spheres \mathbb S^{2n+1} and \mathbb S^{2n}, respectively.   We further study the exponent problem when Y is a space with the homotopy type of \Sigma(n)/G for a homotopy n-sphere \Sigma(n), the complex projective space \mathbb{C}P^n for n\ge 1 or the quaternionic projective space \mathbb{H}P^n for 1\le n\le \infty.
