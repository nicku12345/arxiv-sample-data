In this paper, we associate to two given continuous maps f,g: X\rightarrow Z, on a path connected space X, the relative topological complexity TC^{(f, g, Z)}(X):=TC_X(X\times _ZX) of their fiber space X\times _ZX. When g=f we obtain a variant of the topological complexity TC(f) of f: X\longrightarrow Z generalizing Farber's topological complexity TC(X) in the sens that TC(X)=TC(cst_{x_0}); being cst_{x_0} the constant map on X. Moreover, we prove that TC(f) is a fiberwise homotopy equivalence invariant. When (X,x_0) is a pointed space, we prove that TC^{(f, cst_{x_0}, Z)}(X) interpolates cat(X) and TC(X) for any continuous map f.
