We show that the space \mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{pRc}}(W_g^{2n}) of metrics with positive Ricci curvature on the manifold W^{2n}_g := \sharp^g (S^n \times S^n) has nontrivial rational homology if n \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4 and g are both sufficiently large. The same argument applies to \mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{pRc}}(W_g^{2n} \sharp N) provided that N is spin and W_g^{2n} \sharp N admits a Ricci positive metric.
