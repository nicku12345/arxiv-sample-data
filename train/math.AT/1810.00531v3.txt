Generalizing the ideas of \mathbb{Z}_k-manifolds from Sullivan and the theory of stratifolds from Kreck, we define \mathbb{Z}_k-stratifolds. We introduce the bordism theory of \mathbb{Z}_k-stratifolds in order to represent every homology class with \mathbb{Z}_k-coefficients. We present a geometric interpretation of the Bockstein long exact sequence and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for \mathbb{Z}_k-bordism (k odd) .
