Given a point cloud P in Euclidean space and a positive parameter t we can consider the t-neighborhood P^{t} of P consisting of points at distance less than t to P. Homology of P^{t} gives information about components, holes, voids etc. in P^{t}. The idea of persistent homology is that it may happen that we are interested in some of holes in the spaces P^t that are not detected simultaneously in homology for a single value of t, but where each of these holes is detected for t in a wide range.   When the dimension of the ambient Euclidean space is small, persistent homology is efficiently computed by the \alpha-complex. For dimension bigger than three this becomes resource consuming. Don Sheehy discovered that there exists a filtered simplicial complex whose size depends linearly on the cardinality of P and whose persistent homology is an approximation of the persistent homology of the filtered topological space \{P^{t}\}_{t \ge 0}. In this paper we pursue Sheehy's sparsification approach and give a more general approach to sparsification of filtered simplicial complexes computing the homology of filtered spaces of the form \{P^{t}\}_{t \ge 0} and more generally to sparsification of filtered Dowker nerves. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach to sparsification of general Dowker nerves.
