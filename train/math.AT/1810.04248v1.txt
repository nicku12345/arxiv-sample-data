The aim of this paper is to give a (discrete) Morse theoretic proof of the fact that the k-th skeleton of the flag complex \mathcal{F}, associated to the lattice of subspaces of a finite dimensional vector space, is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension \min\{k,\dim(\mathcal{F})\}. The tight control provided by Morse theoretic methods allows us to give an explicit formula for the number of spheres appearing in each of these wedge summands.
