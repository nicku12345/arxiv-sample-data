Let G be a simply-connected, simple compact Lie group of type \{n_{1},\ldots,n_{\ell}\}, where n_{1}\le\cdots \le n_{\ell}. Let \mathcal{G}_k be the gauge group of the principal G-bundle (namedright{P}{}{S^{4}}) whose isomorphism class is determined by the the second Chern class having value k\in\mathbb{Z}. We calculate the mod-p homology of the classifying space B\mathcal{G}_k provided that n_{\ell}<p-1 and p does not divide k.
