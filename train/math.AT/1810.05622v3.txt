The element P_2^1 of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra has the property (P_2^1)^2=0. This property allows one to view P_2^1 as a differential on H_*(X, \mathbb{F}_2) for any spectrum X. Homology with respect to this differential, \mathcal{M}(X, P_2^1), is called the P_2^1 Margolis homology of X. In this paper we give a complete calculation of the P_2^1 Margolis homology of the 2-local spectrum of topological modular forms tmf and identify its \mathbb{F}_2 basis via an iterated algorithm. We apply the same techniques to calculate P_2^1 Margolis homology for any smash power of tmf.
