We introduce new formulae for the cup-i products on the cochains of spaces. We prove that any set of choices for the cup-i products is isomorphic to the one defined by our formulae if it is natural, minimal, non-degenerate, and free. We also show that Steenrod's original set of choices, as well as all of those induced from operadic and prop theoretic constructions known to the author satisfy these axioms.
