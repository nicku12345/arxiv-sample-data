For n\geq 2 we compute the homotopy groups of (n-1)-connected closed manifolds of dimension (2n+1). Away from the finite set of primes dividing the order of the torsion subgroup in homology, the p-local homotopy groups of M are determined by the rank of the free Abelian part of the homology. Moreover, we show that these p-local homotopy groups can be expressed as a direct sum of p-local homotopy groups of spheres. The integral homotopy type of the loop space is also computed and shown to depend only on the rank of the free Abelian part and the torsion subgroup.
