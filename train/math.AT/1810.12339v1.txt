This expository paper introduces several ideas in chromatic homotopy theory around Morava's extraordinary E-theories. In particular, we construct various moduli problems closely related to Lubin-Tate deformation theory and study their symmetries. These symmetries are then used in conjunction with the Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character theory to provide formulas for the power operations and the stabilizer group action on the E-cohomology of a finite group.
