In the study of smooth functions on manifolds, min-max theory provides a mechanism for identifying critical values of a function. In this paper we introduce a discretized version of this theory associated to a discrete Morse function on a (regular) cell complex. As applications we prove a discrete version of the Mountain Pass Lemma and give an alternate proof of a discrete Lusternik-Schnirelmann Theorem.
