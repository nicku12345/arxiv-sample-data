Let  P  be a poset. We show that the \infty-category \mathbf{Str}_P of \infty-categories with a conservative functor to P can be obtained from the ordinary category of P-stratified topological spaces by inverting a class of weak equivalences. For suitably nice P-stratified topological spaces, the corresponding object of \mathbf{Str}_P is the exit-path \infty-category of MacPherson, Treumann, and Lurie. In particular, the \infty-category of conically P-stratified spaces with equivalences on exit-path \infty-categories inverted embeds fully faithfully into \mathbf{Str}_P. This provides a stratified form of Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis. We then define a combinatorial simplicial model structure on the category of simplicial sets over the nerve of P whose underlying \infty-category is the \infty-category \mathbf{Str}_P. This model structure on P-stratified simplicial sets then allows us to easily compare other theories of P-stratified spaces to ours and deduce that they all embed into ours.
