In this short note, we provide a calculation of the Euler characteristic of a finite homotopy colimit of finite cell complexes, which depends only on the Euler characteristics of each space and resembles Mobius inversion. Versions of the result are known when the colimit is indexed by a finite category, but the behavior is more uniform when we index by finite quasicategories instead. The formula simultaneously generalizes the additive formula for Euler characteristic of a homotopy pushout and the multiplicative formula for Euler characteristic of a fiber bundle.
