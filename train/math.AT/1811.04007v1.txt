We construct combinatorial model category structures on the categories of (marked) categories and (marked) pre-additive categories, and we characterize (marked) additive categories as fibrant objects in a Bousfield localization of pre-additive categories. These model category structures are used to present the corresponding \infty-categories obtained by inverting equivalences. We apply these results to explicitly calculate various limits and colimits in these \infty-categories.
