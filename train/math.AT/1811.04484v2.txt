Let A_1 be any spectrum in a class of finite spectra whose mod 2 cohomology is isomorphic to a free module of rank one over the subalgebra \mathcal{A}(1) of the Steenrod algebra. Let E_{C} be the second Morava-E theory associated to a universal deformation of the formal completion of the supersingular elliptic curve (C) : y^{2}+y = x^{3} defined over \mathbb{F}_{4} and G_{24} a maximal finite subgroup of automorphism group \mathbb{S}_{C} of the formal completion of C. In this paper, we compute the homotopy groups of E_{C}^{hG_{24}}\wedge A_1 by means of the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence.
