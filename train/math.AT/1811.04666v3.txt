This paper gives a uniform, self-contained and direct approach to a variety of obstruction-theoretic problems on manifolds of dimension 7 and 6. We give necessary and sufficient cohomological criteria for the existence of various G-structures on vector bundles over such manifolds especially using low dimensional representations of the group U(2).
