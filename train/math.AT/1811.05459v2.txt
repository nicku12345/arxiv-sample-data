Let \Phi\to \Gamma\to \Sigma be a conormal extension of Hopf algebras over a commutative ring k, and let M be a \Gamma-comodule. The Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence  E_2 = \mathrm{Ext}_\Phi(k,\mathrm{Ext}_\Sigma(k,M)) \implies \mathrm{Ext}_\Gamma(k,M) is a standard tool for computing the Hopf algebra cohomology of \Gamma with coefficients in M in terms of the cohomology of the pieces \Phi and \Sigma. Bruner and Rognes, generalizing a construction of Davis and Mahowald, have introduced a generalization of the Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence converging to \mathrm{Ext}_\Gamma(k,M) that can be defined when \Phi = \Gamma\square_\Sigma k is compatibly an algebra and a \Gamma-comodule. We offer a concrete cobar-like construction that fits into their framework, and show how this work fits into a larger story. In particular, we show that this spectral sequence is isomorphic, starting at the E_1 page, to both the Adams spectral sequence in the stable category of \Gamma-comodules as studied by Margolis and Palmieri, and to a filtration spectral sequence on the cobar complex for \Gamma originally due to Adams. We obtain a description of the E_2 term under an additional flatness assumption. We discuss applications to computing localizations of the Adams spectral sequence E_2 page.
