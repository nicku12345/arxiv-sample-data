In this article we compute the cohomology of complex projective spaces associated to finite dimensional representations of \mathbb{Z}/2 graded on virtual representations of its fundamental groupoid. This fully graded theory, unlike the classical RO(G)-graded theory, allows for the definition of push-forward maps between projective spaces, which we also compute. In the computation we use relations and generators coming from the fully graded cohomology of the projective space of \mathscr {U}, the complete complex \mathbb{Z}/2-universe, as carried out by the first author. This work is the first step in a program for developing \mathbb{Z}/2-equivariant Schubert calculus.
