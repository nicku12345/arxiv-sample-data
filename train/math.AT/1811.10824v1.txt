We define two new unstable n-fold Toda brackets for every composable sequence (f_n, ... ,f_1) of pointed maps f_i : X_i \to X_{i+1} between well-pointed spaces with n > 2. The brackets agree with the classical Toda bracket when n = 3, and they are subsets of both the unstable n-fold Toda brackets of Gershenson and Cohen for every n > 2.
