In this paper we introduce the problem of counting embedded spheres in R^3 whose projection to the z-axis yields a level set barcode of a particular type. Two embedded spheres are considered height equivalent if they are related by a z-level set preserving isotopy. A formula previously used to count functions on the interval with the same sub-level set persistence barcode provides a lower bound on height equivalence classes with the same level set persistence. A conjectured upper bound is provided as well.
