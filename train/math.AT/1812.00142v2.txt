We study the mod-\ell homotopy type of classifying spaces for commutativity, B(\mathbb{Z}, G), at a prime \ell. We show that the mod-\ell homology of B(\mathbb{Z}, G) depends on the mod-\ell homotopy type of BG when G is a compact connected Lie group, in the sense that a mod-\ell homology isomorphism BG \to BH for such groups induces a mod-\ell homology isomorphism B(\mathbb{Z}, G) \to B(\mathbb{Z}, H). In order to prove this result, we study a presentation of B(\mathbb{Z}, G) as a homotopy colimit over a topological poset of closed abelian subgroups, expanding on an idea of Adem and G\'omez. We also study the relationship between the mod-\ell type of a Lie group G(\mathbb{C}) and the locally finite group G(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p) where G is a Chevalley group. We see that the na\"ive analogue for B(\mathbb{Z}, G) of the celebrated Friedlander--Mislin result cannot hold, but we show that it does hold after taking the homotopy quotient of a G action on B(\mathbb{Z}, G).
