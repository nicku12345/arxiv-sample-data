A theory of bisheaves has been recently introduced to measure the homological stability of fibers of maps to manifolds. A bisheaf over a topological space is a triple consisting of a sheaf, a cosheaf, and compatible maps from the stalks of the sheaf to the stalks of the cosheaf. In this note we describe how, given a bisheaf constructible (i.e., locally constant) with respect to a triangulation of its underlying space, one can explicitly determine the coarsest stratification of that space for which the bisheaf remains constructible.
