The algebra {\mathsf A}_q of Steenrod qth powers, where q = p^e is a power of a prime p, is isomorphic to a subalgebra {\mathsf A}'_q of the algebra of Steenrod pth powers {\mathsf A}_p. The filtration of {\mathsf A}_p by powers of its augmentation ideal was studied by J. P. May in his Princeton thesis of 1964. We extend some of May's results to {\mathsf A}_q and obtain a convenient set of defining relations for the graded algebra E^0({\mathsf A}_q). In the case q=p, we recover the observation of S. B. Priddy that the subalgebra E^0({\mathsf A}_p(n-2)) of E^0({\mathsf A}_p) generated by the elements P^{p^j} for 0 \le j \le n-2 is isomorphic to the graded algebra associated to the augmentation ideal filtration of the group algebra {\mathbb F}_p{\mathsf U}(n), where {\mathsf U}(n) is the group of upper unitriangular matrices over {\mathbb F}_p.   The Arnon A basis of {\mathsf A}_p is given by monomials which are minimal in the left lexicographic order of formal monomials in the Steenrod powers. K. G. Monks (for p=2) and D. Yu. Emelyanov and Th. Yu. Popelensky (for p>2) have found a triangular relation between this basis and the Milnor basis using a certain ordering on the Milnor basis. We introduce a variant of the Arnon A basis which is minimal for the right order, and show that this basis and Arnon's original A basis are also triangularly related to the Milnor basis of {\mathsf A}_q using the right order on the Arnon A basis.
