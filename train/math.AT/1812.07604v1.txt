In this paper, we examine how topological complexity, simplicial complexity, discrete topological complexity, and combinatorial complexity compare when applied to models of S^1. We prove that the topological complexity of non-minimal finite models of S^1 can be less-than-or-equal-to 3, and that the TC of the minimal finite model of any n-sphere is equal to 4 for n \geq 1. We show the former using properties of the LS-category, and we show the latter by proving that the TC of the non-Hausdorff suspension of any finite connected T_0 space is equal to 4. We also prove a result about the topological complexity of non-Hausdorff joins of discrete finite spaces, allowing us to exhibit spaces weakly homotopy equivalent to a wedge of circles with arbitrarily high TC.
