Associated with an augmented differential graded algebra R= R^{\geq 0} is a homotopy invariant {\mathcal T}(R). This is a graded vector space, and if H^0(R) is the ground field and H^{>N}(R)= 0 then dim\, {\mathcal T}(R)= 1 if and only if H(R) is a Poincar\'e duality algebra. In the case of Sullivan extensions \land W\to \land W\otimes \land Z\to \land Z in which dim\, H(\land Z)<\infty we show that {\mathcal T}(\land W\otimes \land Z)= {\mathcal T}(\land W)\otimes {\mathcal T}(\land Z). This is applied to finite dimensional CW complexes X where the fundamental group G acts nilpotently in the cohomology H(\widetilde{X};\mathbb Q) of the universal covering space. If H(X;\mathbb Q) is a Poincar\'e duality algebra and H(\widetilde{X};\mathbb Q) and H(BG;\mathbb Q) are finite dimensional then they are also Poincar\'e duality algebras.
