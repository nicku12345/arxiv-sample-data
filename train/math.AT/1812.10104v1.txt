In this paper we caculate mod 2 cohomology ring of F_{\mathbb{Z}_2^m}(\mathbb{R}^m,n) , which is local representation of orbit congfiguration spaces over small covers. We construct a differntial graded algebra, and there is a ring isomorphism between its mod 2 cohomology ring and H^*(F_{\mathbb{Z}_2^m}(\mathbb{R}^m,n),\mathbb{Z}_2). This idea can also be applied to calculate mod 2 cohomology ring of complement space of real arrangements.
