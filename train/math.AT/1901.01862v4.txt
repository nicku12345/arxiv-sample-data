We completely describe the algebraic part of the rational cohomology of the Torelli groups of the manifolds \#^g S^n \times S^n relative to a disc in a stable range, for 2n \geq 6. Our calculation is also valid for 2n=2 assuming that the rational cohomology groups of these Torelli groups are finite dimensional in a stable range.
