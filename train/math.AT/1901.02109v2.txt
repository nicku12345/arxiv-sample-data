We compute the Picard group of the category of K(2)-local module spectra over the ring spectrum E^{hC_4}, where E is a height 2 Morava E-theory and C_4 is a subgroup of the associated Morava stabilizer group. This group can be identified with the Picard group of K(2)-local E-modules in genuine C_4-spectra. We show that in addition to a cyclic subgroup of order 32 generated by  E\wedge S^1 the Picard group contains a subgroup of order 2 generated by E\wedge S^{7+\sigma}, where \sigma is the sign representation of the group C_4. In the process, we completely compute the RO(C_4)-graded Mackey functor homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for the C_4-spectrum E.
