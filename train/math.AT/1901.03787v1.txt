There is only one nontrivial localization of \pi_*S_{(p)} (the chromatic localization at v_0=p), but there are infinitely many nontrivial localizations of the Adams E_2 page for the sphere. The first non-nilpotent element in the E_2 page after v_0 is b_{10}\in \mathrm{Ext}_A^{2p(p-1)-2}(\mathbb{F}_p,\mathbb{F}_p). We work at p=3 and study b_{10}^{-1}\mathrm{Ext}_P(\mathbb{F}_3,\mathbb{F}_3) (where P is the algebra of dual reduced powers), which agrees with the infinite summand \mathrm{Ext}_P(\mathbb{F}_3,\mathbb{F}_3) of \mathrm{Ext}_A(\mathbb{F}_3,\mathbb{F}_3) above a line of slope {1\over 23}. We compute up to the E_9 page of an Adams spectral sequence in the category \mathrm{Stable}(P) converging to b_{10}^{-1}\mathrm{Ext}_P(\mathbb{F}_3,\mathbb{F}_3), and conjecture that the spectral sequence collapses at E_9. We also give a complete calculation of b_{10}^{-1}\mathrm{Ext}_P^*(\mathbb{F}_3,\mathbb{F}_3[\xi_1^3]).
