We consider the Birman-Hilden inclusion \varphi\colon\mathfrak{Br}_{2g+1}\to\Gamma_{g,1} of the braid group into the mapping class group of an orientable surface with boundary, and prove that \varphi is stably trivial in homology with twisted coefficients in the symplectic representation H_1(\Sigma_{g,1}) of the mapping class group; this generalises a result of Song and Tillmann regarding homology with constant coefficients. Furthermore we show that the stable homology of the braid group with coefficients in \varphi^*(H_1(\Sigma_{g,1})) has only 4-torsion.
