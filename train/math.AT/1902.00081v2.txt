Given a path-connected space X and H\leq\pi_1(X,x_0), there is essentially only one construction of a map p_H:(\widetilde{X}_H,\widetilde{x}_0)\rightarrow(X,x_0) with connected and locally path-connected domain that can possibly have the following two properties: (p_{H})_{\#}\pi_1(\widetilde{X}_H,\widetilde{x}_0)=H and p_H has the unique lifting property. \widetilde{X}_H consists of equivalence classes of paths starting at x_0, appropriately topologized, and p_H is the endpoint projection. For p_H to have these two properties, T_1 fibers are necessary and unique path lifting is sufficient. However, p_H always admits the standard lifts of paths.   We show that p_H has unique path lifting if it has continuous (standard) monodromies toward a T_1 fiber over x_0. Assuming, in addition, that H is locally quasinormal (e.g., if H is normal) we show that X is homotopically path Hausdorff relative to H. We show that p_H is a fibration if X is locally path connected, H is locally quasinormal, and all (standard) monodromies are continuous.
