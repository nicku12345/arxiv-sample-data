The present paper is devoted to a recent beautiful and ingenious proof of Brouwer's fixed point theorem due to mathematical economists H. Petri and M. Voorneveld. The heart of this proof is an analogue of Sperner's lemma motivated by Shapley-Scarf model of markets of agents with preferences over indivisible goods.   The goal of the paper is to present a relatively abstract version of Petri-Voorneveld proof which makes transparent both its similarities and its differences with the classical proof based on Sperner's lemma and a well known Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewich argument.
