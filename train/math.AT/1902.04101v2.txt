(Co)bordisms of manifolds and maps are fundamental and important objects in algebraic and differential topology of manifolds and related studies were started by Thom etc.. Cobordisms of Morse functions were introduced and have been studied as a branch of the algebraic and differential topological theory of Morse functions and their higher dimensional versions, or the global singularity theory, by Kalm\'{a}r, Ikegami, Sadykov, Saeki, Wrazidlo, Yamamoto etc. since 2000s.   Cobordism relations are in most cases defined as the following for example; two closed manifolds of a fixed dimension or maps on them into a fixed space are said to be {\it cobordant} if the disjoint union is a boundary of a compact manifold or the restriction of a map satisfying suitable conditions on the manifold into the product of the target space and the closed interval. Such relations induce structures of modules consisting of all obtained equivalence classes such that the sums are defined by procedures of taking disjoint unions and in the cases of manifolds, ring structures such that the products are defined by the procedures of taking products, are also introduced.   In this paper, as a new algebraic topological study, we try to define a product of two cobordism classes of Morse functions and show that a natural method fails, by presenting explicit examples which are regarded as an obstruction.
