We compute the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (LS-cat) and the higher topological complexity (TC_s, s\geq2) of the "no-k-equal" configuration space Conf_k(\mathbb{R},n). This yields (with k=3) the LS-cat and the higher topological complexity of Khovanov's group PP_n of pure planar braids on n strands, which is an \mathbb{R}-analogue of Artin's classical pure braid group on n strands. Our methods can be used to describe optimal motion planners for PP_n provided n is small.
