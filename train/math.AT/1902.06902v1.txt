We present progress in trying to verify a long-standing conjecture by Mark Mahowald on the v_{1}-periodic component of the classical Adams spectral sequence for a Moore space M. The approach we follow was proposed by John Palmieri in his work on the stable category of A-comodules. We improve on Palmieri's work by working with the endomorphism ring of M - End(M) thus resolving some of the initial difficulties of his approach and formulating a conjecture of our own that would lead to Mahowald's formulation.
