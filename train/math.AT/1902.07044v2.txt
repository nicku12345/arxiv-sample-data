This paper studies the magnitude homology groups of geodesic metric spaces. We start with a description of the second magnitude homology of a general metric space in terms of the zeroth homology groups of certain simplicial complexes. Then, on a geodesic metric space, we interpret the description by means of geodesics. The third magnitude homology of a geodesic metric space also admits a description in terms of a simplicial complex. Under an assumption on a metric space, the simplicial description allows us to introduce an invariant of third magnitude homology classes as an intersection number. Finally, we provide a complete description of all the magnitude homology groups of a geodesic metric space which fulfils a certain non-branching assumption.
