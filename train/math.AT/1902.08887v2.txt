We construct a space \mathbb{P} for which the canonical homomorphism \pi_1(\mathbb{P},p) \rightarrow \check{\pi}_1(\mathbb{P},p) from the fundamental group to the first \v{C}ech homotopy group is not injective, although it has all of the following properties: (1) \mathbb{P}\setminus\{p\} is a 2-manifold with connected non-compact boundary; (2) \mathbb{P} is connected and locally path connected; (3) \mathbb{P} is strongly homotopically Hausdorff; (4) \mathbb{P} is homotopically path Hausdorff; (5) \mathbb{P} is 1-UV_0; (6) \mathbb{P} admits a simply connected generalized covering space with monodromies between fibers that have discrete graphs; (7) \pi_1(\mathbb{P},p) naturally injects into the inverse limit of finitely generated free monoids otherwise associated with the Hawaiian Earring; (8) \pi_1(\mathbb{P},p) is locally free.
