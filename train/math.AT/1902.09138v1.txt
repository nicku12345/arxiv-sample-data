Let X be a closed subspace of a metric space M. Under mild hypotheses, one can estimate the Betti numbers of X from a finite set P \subset M of points approximating X. In this paper, we show that one can also use P to estimate much more detailed topological properties of X. These properties are computed via A_\infty-structures, and are therefore related to the cup and Massey products of X, its loop space \Omega X, its formality, linking numbers, etc.   Additionally, we study the following setting: given a continuous function f \colon Y \longrightarrow \mathbb R on a topological space Y, A_\infty persistent homology builds a family of barcodes presenting a highly detailed description of some geometric and topological properties of Y. We prove here that under mild assumptions, these barcodes are stable: small perturbations in the function f imply at most small perturbations in the barcodes.
