We provide a definition of ephemeral multi-persistent modules and prove that the quotient of persistent modules by the ephemeral ones is equivalent to the category of \gamma-sheaves. In the case of one-dimensional persistence, our definition agrees with the usual one showing that the observable category and the category of \gamma-sheaves are equivalent. We also establish isometry theorems between the category of persistent modules and \gamma-sheaves both endowed with their interleaving distance. Finally, we compare the interleaving and convolution distances.
