In this article we study the higher topological complexity {\sf TC}_r(X) in the case when X is an aspherical space, X=K(\pi, 1) and r\ge 2. We give a characterisation of {\sf TC}_r(K(\pi, 1)) in terms of classifying spaces for equivariant Bredon cohomology. Our recent paper \cite{FGLO}, joint with M. Grant and G. Lupton, treats the special case r=2. We also obtain in this paper useful lower bounds for {\sf TC}_r(\pi) in terms of cohomological dimension of subgroups of \pi\times\pi\times \dots\times \pi (r times) with certain properties. As an illustration of the main technique we find the higher topological complexity of the Higman's groups. We also apply our method to obtain a lower bound for the higher topological complexity of the right angled Artin (RAA) groups, which, as was established in \cite{GGY} by a different method (in a more general situation), coincides with the precise value. We finish the paper by a discussion of the {\sf TC}-generating function \sum_{r=1}^\infty {\sf TC}_{r+1}(X)x^r encoding the values of the higher topological complexity {\sf TC}_r(X) for all values of r. We show that in many examples (including the case when X=K(H, 1) with H being a RAA group) the {\sf TC}-generating function is a rational function of the form \frac{P(x)}{(1-x)^2} where P(x) is an integer polynomial with P(1)={\sf cat}(X).
