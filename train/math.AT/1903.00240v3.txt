This paper extends the Alternative to Morse-Novikov Theory we have proposed in [1] from real- and angle-valued map to closed 1-forms. For a topological closed 1-form on a compact ANR, a concept generalizing closed differential 1-form on a compact manifold, under the mild hypothesis of tameness, a fixed field and a non negative integer r, we propose two configurations {\delta}_r, from all real numbers to nonnegative integers, and {\gamma}_r, from positive numbers to nonnegative integers, which recover Novikov-Betti numbers and the Novikov complex associated with a Morse closed 1-form with non-degenerated zeros. Precisely, the sum of the multiplicities of the points in the support of {\delta} equals the Novikov-Betti number and that of the points in the support of {\gamma} equals the rank of the boundary map in the Novikov complex. We formulate the basic properties of these configurations, the stability and the Poincare duality when the underlying space is an orientable closed topological manifold, which in full generality will be proven in the second part of this work.
