In this paper, we study the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer algebra S(3). As an application, we show that for p \geq 7, if s\not \equiv 0, \pm 1 \,\, mod \,p , n\not \equiv 1 \,\, mod\, 3, n>1, then \zeta_n\gamma_s is a nontrivial product in \pi_*(S) by Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, where \zeta_n is created by R. Cohen \cite{Co}, \gamma_s is a third periodic homotopy elements.
