For a given group G and a collection of subgroups \mathcal F of G, we show that there exist a left induced model structure on the category of right G-simplicial sets, in which the weak equivalences and cofibrations are the maps that induce weak equivalences and cofibrations on the H-orbits for all H in \mathcal F. This gives a model categorical criterion for maps that induce weak equivalences on H-orbits to be weak equivalences in the \mathcal F-model structure.
