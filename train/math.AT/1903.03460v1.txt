For an action of a compact torus T on a smooth compact manifold~X with isolated fixed points the number \frac{1}{2}\dim X-\dim T is called the complexity of the action. In this paper we study certain examples of torus actions of complexity one and describe their orbit spaces. We prove that \mathbb{H}P^2/T^3\cong S^5 and S^6/T^2\cong S^4, for the homogeneous spaces \mathbb{H}P^2=Sp(3)/(Sp(2)\times Sp(1)) and S^6=G_2/SU(3). Here the maximal tori of the corresponding Lie groups Sp(3) and G_2 act on the homogeneous spaces by the left multiplication. Next we consider the quaternionic analogues of smooth toric surfaces: they give a class of 8-dimensional manifolds with the action of T^3, generalizing \mathbb{H}P^2. We prove that their orbit spaces are homeomorphic to S^5 as well. We link this result to Kuiper--Massey theorem and some of its generalizations.
