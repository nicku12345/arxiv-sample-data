Let \((M,\omega)\) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension \(2n\) endowed with a Hamiltonian circle action with only isolated fixed points. Whenever \(M\) admits a toric \(1\)-skeleton \(\mathcal{S}\), which is a special collection of embedded \(2\)-spheres in \(M\), we define the notion of equivariant pseudo-index of \(\mathcal{S}\): this is the minimum of the evaluation of the first Chern class \(c_1\) on the spheres of \(\mathcal{S}\). This can be seen as the analog in this category of the notion of pseudo-index for complex Fano varieties. In this paper we provide upper bounds for the equivariant pseudo-index. In particular, when the even Betti numbers of \(M\) are unimodal, we prove that it is at most \(n+1\) . Moreover, when it is exactly \(n+1\), \(M\) must be homotopically equivalent to \(\C P^n\).
