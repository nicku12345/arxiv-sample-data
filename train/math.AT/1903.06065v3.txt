Let \Gamma_{g,1}^m be the mapping class group of the orientable surface \Sigma_{g,1}^m of genus g with one parametrised boundary curve and m permutable punctures; when m=0 we omit it from the notation. Let \beta_{m}(\Sigma_{g,1}) be the braid group on m strands of the surface \Sigma_{g,1}.   We prove that H_*(\Gamma_{g,1}^m;\mathbb{Z}_2)\cong H_*(\Gamma_{g,1};H_*(\beta_{m}(\Sigma_{g,1});\mathbb{Z}_2)). The main ingredient is the computation of H_*(\beta_{m}(\Sigma_{g,1});\mathbb{Z}_2) as a symplectic representation of \Gamma_{g,1}.
