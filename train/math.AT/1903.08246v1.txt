We construct Steinberg summands of G-equivariant spectra with \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)-action. We prove a lemma about their fixed points when G is a p-group, and then use this lemma to compute the fixed points of the Steinberg summand of the equivariant classifying space of (\mathbb{Z}/p)^n. These results will be used in a companion paper to study the layers in the mod p symmetric power filtration for H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p.
