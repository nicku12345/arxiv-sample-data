In this manuscript, we consider cobordism operations in the 2-dimensional labeled open-closed topological quantum field theory for the classifying space of a connected compact Lie group in the sense of Guldberg. In particular, it is proved that the whistle cobordism operation is non-trivial in general provided the labels are in the set of maximal closed subgroups of the given Lie group. The non-triviality of cobordism operations induced by gluing the whistle with the opposite and other labeled cobordisms is also discussed.
