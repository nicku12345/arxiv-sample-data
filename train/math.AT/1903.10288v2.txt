The Joker is an important finite cyclic module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra \mathcal A. We show that the Joker, its first two iterated Steenrod doubles, and their linear duals are realizable by spaces of as low a dimension as the instability condition of modules over the Steenrod algebra permits. This continues and concludes prior work by the first author and yields a complete characterization of which versions of Jokers are realizable by spaces or spectra and which are not. The constructions involve sporadic phenomena in homotopy theory (2-compact groups, topological modular forms) and may be of independent interest.
