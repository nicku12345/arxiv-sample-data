Let G be a finite group. Let U_1,U_2,\dots be a sequence of orthogonal representations in which any irreducible representation of \oplus_{n \geq 1} U_n has infinite multiplicity. Let V_n=\oplus_{i=1}^n U_n and S(V_n) denote the linear sphere of unit vectors. Then for any i \geq 0 the sequence of group \dots \rightarrow \pi_i \operatorname{map}^G(S(V_n),S(V_n)) \rightarrow \pi_i \operatorname{map}^G(S(V_{n+1}),S(V_{n+1})) \rightarrow \dots stabilizes with the stable group \oplus_H \omega_i(BW_GH) where H runs through representatives of the conjugacy classes of all the isotropy group of the points of S(\oplus_n U_n).
