Kitchloo and Morava give a strikingly simple picture of elliptic cohomology at the Tate curve by studying a completed version of S^1-equivariant K-theory for spaces. I present a G-equivariant version of their construction, which is a completed version of the Freed-Hopkins-Teleman model of K-theory for local quotient groupoids and resolves the issues concerning twisting and degree that arise in a first attempt to relate their work to elliptic cohomology.
