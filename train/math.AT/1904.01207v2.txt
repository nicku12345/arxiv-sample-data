Let (G,H)=(SU(2n+1),SO(2n+1)),\,(SU(2n),Sp(n)),\,(SO(2n),SO(2n-1)),\,(E_6,F_4),\,(Spin(8),G_2), and let p be any prime \ge 5 for (G,H)=(E_6,F_4), any prime p\ne 3 for (G,H)=(Spin(8),G_2), and any odd prime otherwise. The classical result of Harris on the relation between the homotopy groups of G and H is reinterpreted as a p-local homotopy equivalence G\simeq_{(p)}H\times G/H, which yields a projection G_{(p)}\to H_{(p)}. We show how much this projection preserves the higher homotopy associativity.
