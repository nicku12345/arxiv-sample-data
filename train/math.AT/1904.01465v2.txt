We construct a generalization of the operadic nerve, providing a translation between the equivariant simplicially enriched operadic world to the parametrized \infty-categorical perspective. This naturally factors through genuine equivariant operads, a model for "equivariant operads with norms up to homotopy". We introduce the notion of an op-fibration of genuine equivariant operads, extending Grothendieck op-fibrations, and characterize fibrant operads as the image of genuine equivariant symmetric monoidal categories. Moreover, we show that under the operadic nerve, this image is sent to G-symmetric monoidal G-\infty-categories. Finally, we produce a functor comparing the notion of algebra over an operad in each of these two contexts.
