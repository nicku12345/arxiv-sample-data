We filter the equivariant Eilenberg Maclane spectrum H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p using the mod p symmetric powers of the equivariant sphere spectrum, \mathrm{Sp}_{\mathbb{Z}/p}^{\infty}(\Sigma^{\infty G}S^0). When G is a p-group, we show that the layers in the filtration are the Steinberg summands of the equivariant classifying spaces of (\mathbb{Z}/p)^n for n=0, 1, 2, \ldots. We show that the layers of the filtration split after smashing with H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p. Along the way, we produced a general computation of the geometric fixed points of H\underline{\mathbb{Z}} and H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p by using symmetric powers.
