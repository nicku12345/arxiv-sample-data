We approach a problem of realising algebraic objects in a certain universal equivariant stable homotopy theory; the global homotopy theory of Schwede. Specifically, for a global ring spectrum R, we consider which classes of ring homomorphisms \eta_\ast\colon\pi_\ast^e R\rightarrow S_\ast can be realised by a map \eta\colon R\rightarrow S in the category of global R-modules, and what multiplicative structures can be placed on S. If \eta_\ast witnesses S_\ast as a projective \pi_\ast^e R-module, then such an \eta exists as a map between homotopy commutative global R-algebras. If \eta_\ast is in addition \'{e}tale or S_0 is a \mathbb{Q}-algebra, then \eta can be upgraded to a map of \mathbb{E}_\infty-global R-algebras or a map of \mathbb{G}_\infty-R-algebras, respectively. Various global spectra and \mathbb{E}_\infty-global ring spectra are then obtained from classical homotopy theoretic and algebraic constructions, with a controllable global homotopy type.
