The Sullivan construction associates to each path connected space or connected simplicial set, X, a special cdga, its minimal model (\land V,d), and to each such cdga \land W its geometric realisation \langle \land W\rangle. The composite of these constructions is the Sullivan completion, X_{\mathbb Q}, of X. In this paper we give a survey of the main properties of Sullivan completions, and include explicit examples.
