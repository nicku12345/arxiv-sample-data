Let X be a connected space. An element [f]\in \pi_n(X) is called rationally inert if   \pi_*(X)\otimes \mathbb Q \to \pi_*(X\cup_fD^{n+1})\otimes \mathbb Q is surjective. We extend the results obtained in the simply connected case, and prove in particular that if X\cup_fD^{n+1} is a Poincar\'e duality complex and the algebra H(X) requires at least two generators then [f]\in \pi_n(X) is rationally inert. On the other hand, if X is rationally a wedge of at least two spheres and f is rationally non trivial, then f is rationally inert. Finally if f is rationally inert then the rational homotopy of the homotopy fibre of the injection X \to X\cup_fD^{n+1} is the completion of a free Lie algebra.
