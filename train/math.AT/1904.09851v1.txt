Let Sp(n) be the symplectic group of quaternionic (n\times n)-matrices. For any 1\leq k\leq n, an element A of Sp(n) can be decomposed in A= \begin{bmatrix} \alpha&T\cr \beta&P \end{bmatrix} with P a (k\times k)-matrix. In this work, starting from a singular value decomposition of P, we obtain what we call a relative singular value decomposition of A. This feature is well adapted for the study of the quaternionic Stiefel manifold X_{n,k}, and we apply it to the determination of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of Sp(k) in X_{2k-j,k}, for j= 0,\,1,\,2
