We import into homotopy theory the algebro-geometric construction of the cotangent space of a geometric point on a scheme. Specializing to the category of spectra local to a Morava K-theory of height d, we show that this can be used to produce a choice-free model of the determinantal sphere as well as an efficient Picard-graded cellular decomposition of K(\mathbb Z_p, d+1). Coupling these ideas to work of Westerland, we give a "Snaith's theorem" for the Iwasawa extension of the K(d)-local sphere.
