This paper is concerned with problems relevant to motion planning in robotics. Configuration spaces are of practical relevance in designing safe control schemes for robots moving on a track. The topological complexity of a configuration space is an integer which can be thought of as the minimum number of continuous instructions required to describe how to move robots between any initial configuration to any final one without collisions. We calculate this number for various examples of robots moving in different tracks represented by graphs. We present and implement an explicit algorithm for two robots to move autonomously and without collisions on a lollipop track.
