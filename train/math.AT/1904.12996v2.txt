We generalize the Mahowald invariant to the \mathbb{R}-motivic and C_2-equivariant settings. For all i>0 with i \equiv 2,3 \mod 4, we show that the \mathbb{R}-motivic Mahowald invariant of (2+\rho \eta)^i \in \pi_{0,0}^{\mathbb{R}}(S^{0,0}) contains a lift of a certain element in Adams' classical v_1-periodic families, and for all i > 0, we show that the \mathbb{R}-motivic Mahowald invariant of \eta^i \in \pi_{i,i}^{\mathbb{R}}(S^{0,0}) contains a lift of a certain element in Andrews' \mathbb{C}-motivic w_1-periodic families. We prove analogous results about the C_2-equivariant Mahowald invariants of (2+\rho \eta)^i \in \pi_{0,0}^{C_2}(S^{0,0}) and \eta^i \in \pi_{i,i}^{C_2}(S^{0,0}) by leveraging connections between the classical, motivic, and equivariant stable homotopy categories. The infinite families we construct are some of the first periodic families of their kind studied in the \mathbb{R}-motivic and C_2-equivariant settings.
