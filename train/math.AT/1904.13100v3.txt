The goal of this paper is to furnish a literature on Goodwillie calculus for functors defined between categories which derive from chain complexes over a ground field \Bbbk.   We characterize homogeneous functors F: \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D} where \mathcal{C} ,\mathcal{D}= Ch (chain complexes), Ch_+(non-negatively graded chain complexes) or \text{Alg}_\mathcal{O} (algebras over a chain complex operad \mathcal{O}). In the particular case when \mathcal{D}= \text{Alg}_\mathcal{O}, our characterization requires \Bbbk to be of characteristics 0.   We are then extending the results of Walter \cite{Walt06} who studied in characteristics 0 the chain complex cases and when \mathcal{O} is the Lie operad.
