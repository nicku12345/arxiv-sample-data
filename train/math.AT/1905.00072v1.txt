Victor Snaith gave a construction of periodic complex bordism by inverting the Bott element in the suspension spectrum of BU. This presents an \mathbb{E}_\infty structure on periodic complex bordism by different means than the usual Thom spectrum definition of the \mathbb{E}_\infty-ring MUP. Here, we prove that these two \mathbb{E}_\infty-rings are in fact different, though the underlying \mathbb{E}_2-rings are equivalent. Nonetheless, we prove that both rings \mathbb{E}_\infty-orient KU_2^{\wedge} and other forms of K-theory.
