Using the loop coproduct, Menichi proved that the cup product with the orientation class vanishes for a closed connected oriented manifold with non-trivial Euler characteristic. We generalize this to the sphere spaces, i.e. the mapping spaces from spheres, using two generalizations of the loop coproduct to sphere spaces. One is constructed in this paper and the other in a previous paper of the author.
