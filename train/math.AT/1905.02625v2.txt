Mahowald's conjecture arose as part of a program attempting to view chromatic phenomena in stable homotopy theory through the lens of the classical Adams spectral sequence. The conjecture predicts the existence of nonzero classes in the cohomology of the finite sub-Hopf algebras A(n) of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra that correspond to generators in the homotopy rings of certain periodic spectra. The purpose of this note is to present a proof of the conjecture.
