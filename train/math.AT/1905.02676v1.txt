We study the analogue of tautological rings of fibre bundles in the context of fibrations with Poincar\'e fibre, i.e. the ring obtained by fibre integrating powers of the fibrewise Euler class. We approach this ring of characteristic classes using rational homotopy theory. More specifically, we discuss a cdga model for the universal fibration and chain level representatives of fibre integration and the fibrewise Euler class. This is particularly useful for rationally elliptic spaces and as an example we compute the tautological ring for complex projective spaces and products of odd spheres.
