Buchstaber and Terzic introduced a notion of universal space of parameters \mathcal{F} for a manifold M^{2n}, which has an effective action of compact torus T^k , k \leq n with some additional properties. with special properties. This space is needed to construction of factor M^{2n}/T^k. Buchstaber and Terzic constructed the universal space of parameters for G_{5,2}. In this work we construct universal space of parameters for complex Grassmann manifold G_{q+1,2}. Our construction is based on the construction of moduli space of stable curves of genus zero with q+1 marked points due to Salamon, McDuff and Hofer.
