The motivic Mahowald invariant was introduced in \cite{Qui19a} and \cite{Qui19b} to study periodicity in the \mathbb{C}- and \mathbb{R}-motivic stable stems. In this paper, we define the motivic Mahowald invariant over any field F of characteristic not two and use it to study periodicity in the F-motivic stable stems. In particular, we construct lifts of some of Adams' classical v_1-periodic families \cite{Ada66} and identify them as the motivic Mahowald invariants of powers of 2+\rho \eta.
