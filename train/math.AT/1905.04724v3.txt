We compute the rational cohomology of unordered configuration spaces of points on any closed orientable surface. We find a series with coefficients in the Grothendieck ring of sp(2g) that describes explicitly the decomposition of the cohomology into irreducible representations. From that we deduce the mixed Hodge numbers and the Betti numbers, obtaining a formula without cancellations. This new formula shows that the Betti numbers growth as a polynomial of degree 2g-1.
