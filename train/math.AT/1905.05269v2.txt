In this paper we recover Bousfield's computation of \nu_1-periodic homotopy groups of simply connected, finite H-spaces from \cite{Bou99} using the techniques of Goodwillie calculus. This is done through first computing Andr\'{e}-Quillen cohomology over the monad \mathbb{T} that encodes the power operations of complex K-theory. Then lifting this computation to computing K-theory of topological Andr\'{e}-Quillen cohomology, and then using results of Behrens and Rezk relating it back to the Bousfield-Kuhn functor. The fact that we recovers the result of Bousfield allows us to conclude \nu_1-periodic Goodwillie tower for simply connected, finite H-spaces converges.
