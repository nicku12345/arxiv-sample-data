We define a variant of Benjamini-Schramm convergence for finite simplicial complexes with the action of a fixed finite group G which leads to the notion of random rooted simplicial G-complexes. For every random rooted simplicial G-complex we define a corresponding \ell^2-homology and the \ell^2-multiplicity of an irreducible representation of G in the homology. The \ell^2-multiplicities generalize the \ell^2-Betti numbers and we show that they are continuous on the space of sofic random rooted simplicial G-complexes. In addition, we study induction of random rooted complexes and discuss the effect on \ell^2-multiplicities.
