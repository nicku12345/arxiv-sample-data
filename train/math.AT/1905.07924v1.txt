Torus orbifolds are topological generalization of symplectic toric orbifolds. We give a construction of smooth orbifolds with torus actions whose boundary is a disjoint union of torus orbifolds using toric topological method. As a result, we show that any orientable locally standard torus orbifold is equivariantly cobordant to some copies of orbifold complex projective spaces. We also discuss some further equivariant cobordism results including the cases when torus orbifolds are actually torus manifolds.
