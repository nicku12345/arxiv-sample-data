The unordered configuration space of n points on a graph \Gamma, denoted here by UC^n(\Gamma), can be viewed as the space of all configurations of n unlabeled robots on a system of one-dimensional tracks, which is interpreted as a graph \Gamma. The topology of these spaces is related to the number of vertices of degree greater than 2; this number is denoted by m(\Gamma). We discuss a combinatorial approach to compute the topological complexity of a "discretized" version of this space, UD^n(\Gamma), and give results for certain classes of graphs. In the first case, we show that for a large class of graphs, as long as the number of robots is at least 2m(\Gamma), then TC(UD^n(\Gamma))=2m(\Gamma)+1. In the second, we show that as long as the number of robots is at most half the number of vertex-disjoint cycles in \Gamma, we have TC(UD^n(\Gamma))=2n+1.
