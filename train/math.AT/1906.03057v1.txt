Let K(\mathbb{F}_q) be the algebraic K-theory spectrum of the finite field with q elements and let p \geq 5 be a prime number coprime to q. In this paper we study the mod p and v_1 topological Hochschild homology of K(\mathbb{F}_q), denoted V(1)_*THH(K(\mathbb{F}_q)), as an \mathbb{F}_p-algebra. The computations are organized in four different cases, depending on the mod p behaviour of the function q^n-1. We use different spectral sequences, in particular the B\"okstedt spectral sequence and a generalization of a spectral sequence of Brun developed in an earlier paper. We calculate the \mathbb{F}_p-algebras THH_*(K(\mathbb{F}_q); H\mathbb{F}_p), and we compute V(1)_*THH(K(\mathbb{F}_q)) in the first two cases.
