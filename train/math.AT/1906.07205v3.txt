We show that for some classes of groups G, the homotopy fiber E_{\mathrm{com}} G of the inclusion of the classifying space for commutativity E_{\mathrm{com}} G into the classifying space BG, is contractible if and only if G is abelian. We show this both for compact connected Lie groups and for discrete groups. To prove those results, we define an interesting map \mathfrak{c} \colon E_{\mathrm{com}} G \to B[G,G] and show it is not nullhomotopic for the non-abelian groups in those classes. Additionally, we show that \mathfrak{c} is 3-connected for G=O(n) when n \ge 3.
