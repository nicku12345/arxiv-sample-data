We use the C_2-equivariant Adams spectral sequence to compute part of the C_2-equivariant stable homotopy groups \pi^{C_2}_{n,n}. This allows us to recover results of Bredon and Landweber on the image of the geometric fixed-points map from the equivariant homotopy group \pi^{C_2}_{n,n} to the classical \pi_0. We also recover results of Mahowald and Ravenel on the Mahowald root invariants of the elements 2^k.
