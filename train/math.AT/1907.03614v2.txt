We introduce a topological variant of the Grothendieck construction which serves to represent every fiber bundle over an Alexandroff space. Using this result we give a classification theorem for fiber bundles over Alexandroff spaces with T_0 fiber and we construct a universal bundle for bundles with T_0 fiber over posets which are cofibrant objects of the category of small categories. Moreover, we prove that our construction induces an equivalence of categories between a suitable category of functors and the category of fiber bundles over a fixed Alexandroff space. In addition, we prove that any fiber bundle over an Alexandroff space is a fibration.
