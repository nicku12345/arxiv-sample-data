We show that that classical rational homotopy theory in the sense of Sullivan [6] can be extended compactly supported setting. This presents a simplicial version of the compactly supported de Rham complex in characteristic zero, and proving that it models singular compactly supported cohomology. This presents new avenues of possible study in proper homotopy theory, and further extensions of the ideas within the classical literature of Quillen [5] and Sullivan.
