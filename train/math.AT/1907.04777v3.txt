Let G be a compact connected Lie group and K a closed connected subgroup. Assume that the order of any torsion element in the integral cohomology of G and K is invertible in a given principal ideal domain k. It is known that in this case the cohomology of the homogeneous space G/K with coefficients in k and the torsion product of H^{*}(BK) and k over H^{*}(BG) are isomorphic as k-modules. We show that this isomorphism is multiplicative and natural in the pair (G,K) provided that 2 is invertible in k. The proof uses homotopy Gerstenhaber algebras in an essential way. In particular, we show that the normalized singular cochains on the classifying space of a torus are formal as a homotopy Gerstenhaber algebra.
