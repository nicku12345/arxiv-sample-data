We study the Morava E-theory (at a prime p) of BGL_d(F), where F is a finite field with |F|=1\pmod{p}. Taking all d together, we obtain a structure with two products \times and \bullet. We prove that it is a polynomial ring under \times, and that the module of \times-indecomposables inherits a \bullet-product, and we describe the structure of the resulting ring. In the process, we prove many auxiliary structural results.
