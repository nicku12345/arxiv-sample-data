A surface with an involution can be viewed as a C_2-space where C_2 is the cyclic group of order two. Using the classification of C_2-surfaces given by Dugger, we compute the RO(C_2)-graded Bredon cohomology of all C_2-surfaces in constant \mathbb{Z}/2 coefficients as modules over the cohomology of a point. We show the cohomology depends only on three numerical invariants in the nonfree case, and only on two numerical invariants in the free case.
