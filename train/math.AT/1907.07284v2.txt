Let C_2 denote the cyclic group of order two. Given a manifold with a C_2-action, we can consider its equivariant Bredon RO(C_2)-graded cohomology. In this paper, we develop a theory of fundamental classes for equivariant submanifolds in RO(C_2)-graded cohomology in constant \mathbb{Z}/2 coefficients. We show the cohomology of any C_2-surface is generated by fundamental classes, and these classes can be used to easily compute the ring structure. To define fundamental classes we are led to study the cohomology of Thom spaces of equivariant vector bundles. In general the cohomology of the Thom space is not just a shift of the cohomology of the base space, but we show there are still elements that act as Thom classes, and cupping with these classes gives an isomorphism within a certain range.
