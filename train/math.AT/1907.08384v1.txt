The concept of homotopic distance and its higher analog are introduced in [6]. In this paper we introduce some important properties of higher homotopic distance, investigate the conditions under which \cat, \secat and higher dimensional topological complexity are equal to the higher homotopic distance, and give alternative proofs, using higher homotopic distance, to some \TC_n-related theorems.
