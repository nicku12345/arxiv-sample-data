An isovariant map between spaces with a group action is an equivariant map which preserves isotropy groups. In this paper, we show that for a finite group G, the category of G-spaces with isovariant maps has a Quillen model structure. We prove a Piacenza-style model theoretic proof of an isovariant Elmendorf's theorem, showing that this model structure is Quillen equivalent to a model category of diagrams.
