Quillen showed how to describe the homotopy theory of simply-connected rational spaces in terms of differential graded Lie algebras. Here we survey a generalization of Quillen's results that describes the v_n-periodic localizations of homotopy theory (where rational corresponds to n=0) in terms of spectral Lie algebras. The latter form an extension of the theory of Lie algebras to the setting of stable homotopy theory. This is a chapter written for the Handbook of Homotopy Theory edited by Haynes Miller.
