Let G be a profinite group, X a discrete G-spectrum with trivial action, and X^{hG} the continuous homotopy fixed points. For any N \trianglelefteq_o G ("o" for open), X = X^N is a G/N-spectrum with trivial action. We construct a zigzag \text{colim}\,_N \,X^{hG/N} \buildrel\Phi\over\longrightarrow \text{colim}\,_N \,(X^{hN})^{hG/N} \buildrel\Psi\over\longleftarrow X^{hG}, where \Psi is a weak equivalence. When \Phi is a weak equivalence, this zigzag gives an interesting model for X^{hG} (for example, its Spanier-Whitehead dual is \text{holim}\,_N \,F(X^{hG/N}, S^0)). We prove that this happens in the following cases: (1) |G| < \infty; (2) X is bounded above; (3) there exists \{U\} cofinal in \{N\}, such that for each U, H^s_c(U, \pi_\ast(X)) = 0, for s > 0. Given (3), for each U, there is a weak equivalence X \buildrel\simeq\over\longrightarrow X^{hU} and X^{hG} \simeq X^{hG/U}. For case (3), we give a series of corollaries and examples. As one instance of a family of examples, if p is a prime, K(n_p,p) the n_pth Morava K-theory K(n_p) at p for some n_p \geq 1, and \mathbb{Z}_p the p-adic integers, then for each m \geq 2, (3) is satisfied when G \leqslant \prod_{p \leq m} \mathbb{Z}_p is closed, X = \bigvee_{p > m} (H\mathbb{Q} \vee K(n_p,p)), and \{U\} := \{N_G \mid N_G \trianglelefteq_o G\}.
