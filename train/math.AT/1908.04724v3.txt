The Torelli group of W_g = \#^g S^n \times S^n is the subgroup of the diffeomorphisms of W_g fixing a disc which act trivially on H_n(W_g;Z). The rational cohomology groups of the Torelli group are representations of an arithmetic subgroup of Sp_{2g}(Z) or O_{g,g}(Z). In this paper we prove that for 2n \geq 6 and g \geq 2, they are in fact algebraic representations. Combined with previous work, this determines the rational cohomology of the Torelli group in a stable range. We further prove that the classifying space of the Torelli group is nilpotent.
