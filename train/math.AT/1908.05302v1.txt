Let S^{2n+1}\{p\} denote the homotopy fibre of the degree p self map of S^{2n+1}. For primes p \ge 5, work of Selick shows that S^{2n+1}\{p\} admits a nontrivial loop space decomposition if and only if n=1 or p. Indecomposability in all but these dimensions was obtained by showing that a nontrivial decomposition of \Omega S^{2n+1}\{p\} implies the existence of a p-primary Kervaire invariant one element of order p in \pi_{2n(p-1)-2}^S. We prove the converse of this last implication and observe that the homotopy decomposition problem for \Omega S^{2n+1}\{p\} is equivalent to the strong p-primary Kervaire invariant problem for all odd primes. For p=3, we use the 3-primary Kervaire invariant element \theta_3 to give a new decomposition of \Omega S^{55}\{3\} analogous to Selick's decomposition of \Omega S^{2p+1}\{p\} and as an application prove two new cases of a long-standing conjecture stating that the fibre of the double suspension S^{2n-1} \longrightarrow \Omega^2S^{2n+1} is homotopy equivalent to the double loop space of Anick's space.
