We construct some spectral sequences as tools for computing commutative cohomology of commutative Lie algebras in characteristic 2. In a first part, we focus on a Hochschild-Serre-type spectral sequence, while in a second part we obtain comparison spectral sequences which mediate between Chevalley-Eilenberg-, commutative-and Leibniz cohomology. These methods are illustrated by a few computations.
