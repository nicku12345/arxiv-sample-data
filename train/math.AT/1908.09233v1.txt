When X is an associative H-space, the bar spectral sequence computes the homology of the delooping, H_{*}(BX). If X is an n-fold loop space for n\geq2 this is a spectral sequence of Hopf algebras. Using machinery by Sugawara and Clark, we show that the spectral sequence filtration respects the Browder bracket structure on H_{*}(BX), and so it is moreover a spectral sequence of Poisson algebras. Through the bracket on the spectral sequence, we establish a connection between the degree n-1 bracket on H_{*}(X) and the degree n-2 bracket on H_{*}(BX). This generalizes a result of Browder and puts it in a computational context.
