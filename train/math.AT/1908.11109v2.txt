We present a criterion for the existence of periodic points based on the eigenvalues of maps induced in cohomology for spaces with rational cohomology isomorphic to a tensor product of a graded exterior algebra with generators in odd dimensions and a graded algebra with all elements of even degree. We give a number of natural examples of such spaces and provide some non-trivial ones. We also give a counterexample to a claim in \cite{duan} given there without proof.
