Let p be an odd prime and let \mathit{EO} = E_{p-1}^{hC_p} be the C_p fixed points of height p-1 Morava E theory. We say that a spectrum X has algebraic \mathit{EO} theory if the splitting of K_*(X) as an K_*[C_p]-module lifts to a topological splitting of \mathit{EO} \wedge X. We develop criteria to show that a spectrum has algebraic \mathit{EO} theory, in particular showing that any connective spectrum with mod p homology concentrated in degrees 2k(p - 1) has algebraic \mathit{EO} theory. As an application, we answer a question posed by Hovey and Ravenel by producing a unital orientation \mathit{MY}_{4p-4}\to \mathit{EO} analogous to the \mathit{MSU} orientation of \mathit{KO} at p=2.
