Extending work of many authors we calculate the higher simple structure sets of lens spaces in the sense of surgery theory with the fundamental group of arbitrary order. As a corollary we also obtain a calculation of the simple structure sets of the products of lens spaces and spheres of dimension grater or equal to 3.
