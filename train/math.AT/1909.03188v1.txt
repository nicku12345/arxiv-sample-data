We explore the canonical Grothendieck topology and a new homotopical analog. First we discuss some background information, including defining a new 2-category called the Index-Functor Category and a sieve generalization. Then we discuss a specific description of the covers in the canonical topology and a homotopical analog. Lastly, we explore the covers in the homotopical analog by obtaining some examples.
