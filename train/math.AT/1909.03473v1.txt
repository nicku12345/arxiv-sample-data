Let R be a principal ideal domain (PID). For a simply connected CW-complex X of dimension n, let Y be a space obtained by attaching cells of dimension q to X, q>n, and let A(Y) denote an Adams-Hilton model of Y. If \mathcal E(A(Y)) denotes the group of homotopy self-equivalences of A(Y) and \mathcal E_{*}(A(Y)) its subgroup of the elements inducing the identity on H_{*}( Y,R), then we construct two short exact sequences: \underset{i}{\oplus}\,H_{q}(\Omega X,R)\rightarrowtail \mathcal{E}(A(Y))\overset{}{   \twoheadrightarrow}\Gamma^{q}_{n}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underset{i}{\oplus}\,H_{q}(\Omega X,R) \rightarrowtail \E_{*}(A(Y))\overset{}{   \twoheadrightarrow}\Pi^{q}_{n}  where i=\mathrm{rank} \,H_{q}(Y,X;R), \Gamma^{q}_{n} is a subgroup of \aut(\mathrm{Hom}_{}(H_{q}( Y,X;R))\times \E(A(X)) and \Pi^{q}_{n} is a subgroup of \mathcal E_{*}(A(X)).
