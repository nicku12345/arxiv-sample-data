In this paper, we construct incomplete versions of the equivariant stable category; i.e., equivariant stabilization of the category of G-spaces with respect to incomplete systems of transfers encoded by an N_\infty operad \mathcal{O}. These categories are built from the categories of \mathcal{O}-algebras in G-spaces. Using this operadic formulation, we establish incomplete versions of the usual structural properties of the equivariant stable category, notably the tom Dieck splitting. Our work is motivated in part by the examples arising from the equivariant units and Picard space functors.
