Infinitary operations, such as products indexed by countably infinite linear orders, arise naturally in the context of fundamental groups and groupoids. We prove that the well-definedness of products indexed by a scattered linear order in the fundamental groupoid of a first countable space is equivalent to the homotopically Hausdorff property. To prove this characterization, we employ the machinery of closure operators, on the \pi_1-subgroup lattice, defined in terms of test maps from one-dimensional domains.
