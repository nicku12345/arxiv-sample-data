This paper displays complexity reduction techniques for calculations of path categories (or fundamental categories) P(K) for finite simplicial and cubical complexes K. The central technique involves identifying inclusions of complexes for which the induced functor of path categories is fully faithful. Refinements of cubical complex structures are discussed. A first method for parallelizing the calculation of path categories for cubical complexes is introduced.
