We study how smashing Bousfield localizations behave under various equivariant functors. We show that the analogs of the smash product and chromatic convergence theorems for the Real Johnson-Wilson theories E_{\mathbb{R}}(n) hold only after Borel completion. We establish analogous results for the C_{2^n}-equivariant Johnson-Wilson theories constructed by Beaudry, Hill, Shi, and Zeng. We show that induced localizations upgrade the available norms for an N_\infty-algebra, and we determine which new norms appear. Finally, we explore generalizations of our results on smashing localizations in the context of a quasi-Galois extension of E_\infty-rings.
