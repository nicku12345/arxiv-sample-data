We consider a functor from the category of groups to itself G\mapsto \mathbb Z_\infty G that we call right exact \mathbb Z-completion of a group. It is connected with the pronilpotent completion \hat G by the short exact sequence 1\to {\varprojlim}^1\: M_n G \to \mathbb Z_\infty G \to \hat G \to 1, where M_n G is n-th Baer invariant of G. We prove that \mathbb Z_\infty \pi_1(X) is an invariant of homological equivalence of a space X. Moreover, we prove an analogue of Stallings' theorem: if G\to G' is a 2-connected group homomorphism, then \mathbb Z_\infty G\cong \mathbb Z_\infty G'. We give examples of 3-manifolds X,Y such that  \hat{\pi_1(X)}\cong \hat{\pi_1( Y)} but \mathbb Z_\infty \pi_1(X)\not \cong \mathbb Z_\infty \pi_1(Y). We prove that for a finitely generated group G we have (\mathbb Z_\infty G)/ \gamma_\omega= \hat G. So the difference between \hat G and \mathbb Z_\infty G lies in \gamma_\omega. This allows us to treat \mathbb Z_\infty \pi_1(X) as a transfinite invariant of X. The advantage of our approach is that it can be used not only for 3-manifolds but for arbitrary spaces.
