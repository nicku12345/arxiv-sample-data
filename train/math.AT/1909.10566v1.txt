We describe some regular behavior in the motivic wedge, which is a subalgebra of the cohomology Ext_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbb{M}_2,\mathbb{M}_2) of the \mathbb{C}-motivic Steenrod algebra. The key tool is to compare motivic computations to classical computations, to Ext_{\mathbf{A}(2)}(\mathbb{M}_2,\mathbb{M}_2), or to h_1-localization of Ext_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbb{M}_2,\mathbb{M}_2). We also give a conjecture on the behavior of the family e_0^tg^k in Ext_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbb{M}_2,\mathbb{M}_2) which raises naturally from the study of the motivic wedge.
