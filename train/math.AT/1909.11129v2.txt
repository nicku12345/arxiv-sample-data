Let M be a smooth, orientable, closed, connected 4-manifold and suppose that H_1(M;\mathbb{Z}) is finitely generated and has no 2-torsion. We give a homotopy decomposition of the suspension of M in terms of spheres, Moore spaces and \Sigma\mathbb{C}P^{2}. This is used to calculate the K-theory of M as a group and to determine the homotopy types of certain current groups and gauge groups.
