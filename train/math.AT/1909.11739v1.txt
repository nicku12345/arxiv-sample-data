The homotopy category of N_\infty operads is equivalent to a finite lattice, and as the ambient group varies, there are various image constructions between these lattices. In this paper, we explain how to lift this algebraic structure back to the operad level. We show that lattice joins and meets correspond to derived operadic coproducts and products, and we show that the image constructions correspond to derived operadic induction, restriction, and coinduction, at least when taken along an injective homomorphism.   We also prove that a derived variant of the Boardman-Vogt tensor product lifts the join. Our result does not resolve Blumberg and Hill's conjecture on the usual tensor product, but it does imply that every N_\infty ring spectrum can be replaced with an equivalent spectrum, which is equipped with a self-interchanging operad action.
