We study the tmf-based Adams spectral sequence for the type 2 spectrum Z. We establish the structure of the E_1-page of this spectral sequence, and compute the d_1-differential modulo v_2-torsion. We develop a technique for performing low dimensional calculations, and use this to compute the spectral sequence fully in stems < 40. We use this computation to prove that the K(2)-local Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for Z studied by the third author and Egger collapses, resulting in the computation of the homotopy groups of Z_{K(2)}. We discuss how these computations fit with the conjectural failure of the telescope conjecture.
