We construct a canonical family of even periodic \mathbb{E}_{\infty}-ring spectra, with exactly one member of the family for every prime p and chromatic height n. At height 1 our construction is due to Snaith, who built complex K-theory from \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}. At height 2 we replace \mathbb{CP}^{\infty} with a p-local retract of \mathrm{BU} \langle 6 \rangle, producing a new theory that orients elliptic, but not generic, height 2 Morava E-theories.   In general our construction exhibits a kind of redshift, whereby \mathrm{BP}\langle n-1 \rangle is used to produce a height n theory. A familiar sequence of Bocksteins, studied by Tamanoi, Ravenel, Wilson, and Yagita, relates the K(n)-localization of our height n ring to work of Peterson and Westerland building E_n^{hS\mathbb{G}^{\pm}} from \mathrm{K}(\mathbb{Z},n+1).
