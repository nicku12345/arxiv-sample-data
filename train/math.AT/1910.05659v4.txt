We construct a complex analytic version of an equivariant cohomology theory which appeared in a recent paper of Rezk, and which is roughly modeled on the Borel-equivariant cohomology of the double free loop space. The construction is defined on finite, torus-equivariant CW complexes and takes values in coherent holomorphic sheaves over the moduli stack of complex elliptic curves. Our methods involve an inverse limit construction over all finite dimensional subcomplexes of the double free loop space, following an analogous construction of Kitchloo for single free loop spaces. We show that, for any given complex elliptic curve \mathcal{C}, the fiber of our construction over \mathcal{C} is isomorphic to Grojnowski's equivariant elliptic cohomology theory associated to \mathcal{C}.
