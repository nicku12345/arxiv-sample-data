Ando, Morava, and Sadofsky showed that the Tate construction for a trivial \mathbb{Z}/p-action decreases the chromatic height of Johnson-Wilson theory, and Greenlees and Sadofsky proved that the Tate construction for a trivial finite group action vanishes on Morava K-theory. We prove C_2-equivariant enrichments of these results using the parametrized Tate construction. The C_2-fixed points of our results produce new blueshift and vanishing results for Real Johnson-Wilson theories ER(n) and Real Morava K-theories KR(n), respectively, for all n. In particular, our blueshift results generalize Greenlees and May's Tate splitting of KO to all chromatic heights.
