We construct a genuine G-equivariant extension of factorization homology for G a finite group, assigning a genuine G-spectrum to a manifold with G-action. We show that G-factorization homology is compatible with Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norms and satisfies equivariant \otimes-excision. Following Ayala-Francis we prove an axiomatic characterization of genuine G-factorization homology. Applications include a description of real topological Hochschild homology and relative topological Hochschild homology of C_n-rings using genuine G-factorization homology.
