Let X be a simply connected rational elliptic space of formal dimension n and let \E(X) denote the group of homotopy classes of self-equivalences of X. If X^{[k]} denotes the k^{\text{th}} Postikov section of X and X^{k} denotes its k^{\text{th}} skeleton, then making use of the models of Sullivan and Quillen we prove that \E(X)\cong\E(X^{[n]}) and if n>m=max\big\{k \,| \,\pi_{k}(X)\neq 0\big\} and \E(X) is finite, then \E(X)\cong\E(X^{m+1}). Moreover, in case when X is 2-connected, we show that if \pi_{n}(X)\neq0, then the group \E(X) is infinite.
