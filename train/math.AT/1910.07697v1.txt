We classify bounded t-structures on the category of perfect complexes over a commutative, Noetherian ring of finite Krull dimension, extending a result of Alonso Tarrio, Jeremias Lopez and Saorin which covers the regular case. In particular, we show that there are no bounded t-structures in the singular case, verifying the affine version of a conjecture of Antieau, Gepner and Heller, and also that there are no non-trivial t-structures at all in the singular, irreducible case.
