We record a result concerning the Koszul dual of the arity filtration on an operad. This result is then used to give conditions under which, for a general operad, the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality arrow of Ayala-Francis is an equivalence. We discuss how the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality arrow for the little n-disks operad \mathcal{E}_n relates to their work when combined with the self-Koszul duality of \mathcal{E}_n.
