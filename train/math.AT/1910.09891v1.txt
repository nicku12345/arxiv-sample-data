In recent years, A. Grigor'yan, Y. Lin, Y. Muranov and S.T. Yau [6, 7, 8, 9] constructed a path homology theory for digraphs. Later, S. Chowdhury and F. Memoli [3] studied the persistent path homology for directed networks. In this paper, we generalize the path homology theory for digraphs and construct a weighted path homology for weighted digraphs. We study the persistent weighted path homology for weighted digraphs and detect the effects of the weights on the persistent weighted path homology. We prove a persistent version of a Kunneth-type formula for joins of weighted digraphs.
