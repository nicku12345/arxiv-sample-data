We establish, in the setting of equivariant motivic homotopy theory for a finite group, a version of tom Dieck's splitting theorem for the fixed points of a suspension spectrum. Along the way we establish structural results and constructions for equivariant motivic homotopy theory of independent interest. This includes geometric fixed point functors and the motivic Adams isomorphism.
