We study completion with respect to the iterated suspension functor on \mathcal{O}-algebras, where \mathcal{O} is a reduced operad in symmetric spectra. This completion is the unit of a derived adjunction comparing \mathcal{O}-algebras with coalgebras over the associated iterated suspension-loop homotopical comonad via the iterated suspension functor. We prove that this derived adjunction becomes a derived equivalence when restricted to 0-connected \mathcal{O}-algebras and r-connected \tilde{\Sigma}^r \tilde{\Omega}^r-coalgebras. We also consider the dual picture, using iterated loops to build a cocompletion map from algebras over the iterated loop-suspension homotopical monad to \mathcal{O}-algebras. This is the counit of a derived adjunction, which we prove is a derived equivalence when restricting to r-connected \mathcal{O}-algebras and 0-connected \tilde{\Omega}^r \tilde{\Sigma}^r-algebras.
