Certain toric dynamical systems studied in physical chemistry have associated toric varieties which, when smooth, represent elements in the homotopy groups M\xi_*B\T of a symplectic variant of the A_\infty Baker-Richter spectrum M\xi. The noncommutative Hopf algebroid (M\xi_*,M\xi_*M\xi) has interesting connections to the group of formal diffeomorphism of the noncommutative line, conjecturally defining a noncommutative analog Helmholtz free energy for systems of complex symplectic (completely integrable) Hamiltonian toric manifolds
