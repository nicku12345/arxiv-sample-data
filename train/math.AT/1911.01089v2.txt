In this work, we study the classification of differential graded algebras over \mathbb{Z} (DGAs) whose homology is \mathbb{F}_p[x], i.e. the polynomial algebra over \mathbb{F}_p on a single generator. This classification problem was left open in work of Dwyer, Greenlees and Iyengar.   For \lvert y_{2p-2} \rvert = 2p-2, we show that there is a unique non-formal DGA with homology \mathbb{F}_p[y_{2p-2}] and a non-formal 2p-2 Postnikov section. Among a classification result, this provides the first example of a non-formal DGA with homology \mathbb{F}_p[x]. By duality, this also shows that there is a non-formal DGA whose homology is an exterior algebra over \mathbb{F}_p with a generator in degree -(2p-1).   Considering the classification of the ring spectra corresponding to these DGAs, we show that every E_2 DGA with homology \mathbb{F}_p[x] (with no restrictions on \lvert x \rvert) is topologically equivalent to the formal DGA with homology \mathbb{F}_p[x], i.e. they are topologically formal. This follows by a theorem of Hopkins and Mahowald.
