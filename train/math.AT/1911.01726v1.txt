Let M be a subset of vector space or projective space. The authors define the \emph{generalized configuration space} of M which is formed by n-tuples of elements of M where any k elements of each n-tuple are linearly independent. The \emph{generalized configuration space} gives a generalization of the classical configuration space defined by E.Fadell. Denote the \emph{generalized configuration space} of M by W_{k,n}(M). The authors are mainly interested in the calculation about the homotopy groups of generalized configuration space. This article gives the fundamental groups of generalized configuration spaces of \mathbb{R}P^m for some special cases, and the connections between the homotopy groups of generalized configuration spaces of S^m and the homotopy groups of Stiefel manifolds. It is also proved that the higher homotopy groups of generalized configuration spaces W_{k,n}(S^m) and W_{k,n}(\mathbb{R}P^m) are isomorphic.
