We construct and study projective and Reedy model category structures for bimodules and infinitesimal bimodules over topological operads. Both model structures produce the same homotopy categories. For the model categories in question, we build explicit cofibrant and fibrant replacements. We show that these categories are right proper and under some conditions left proper. We also study the extension/restriction adjunctions.
