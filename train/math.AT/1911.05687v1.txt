We give a new proof, independent of Lin's theorem, of the Segal conjecture for the cyclic group of order two. The key input is a calculation, as a Hopf algebroid, of the Real topological Hochschild homology of \mathbb{F}_2. This determines the \mathrm{E}_2-page of the descent spectral sequence for the map \mathrm{N}\mathbb{F}_2 \to \mathbb{F}_2, where \mathrm{N}\mathbb{F}_2 is the C_2-equivariant Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel norm of \mathbb{F}_2. The \mathrm{E}_2-page represents a new upper bound on the RO(C_2)-graded homotopy of \mathrm{N}\mathbb{F}_2, from which the Segal conjecture is an immediate corollary.
