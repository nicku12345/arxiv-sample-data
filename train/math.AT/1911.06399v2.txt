We establish a Quillen equivalence between the homotopy theories of equivariant Segal operads and equivariant simplicial operads with norm maps. Together with previous work, we further conclude that the homotopy coherent nerve is a right-Quillen equivalence from the model category of equivariant simplicial operads with norm maps to the model category structure for equivariant-\infty-operads in equivariant dendroidal sets.
