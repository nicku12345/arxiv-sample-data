The 2-primary homotopy \beta-family, defined as the collection of Mahowald invariants of Mahowald invariants of 2^i, i \geq 1, is an infinite collection of periodic elements in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. In this paper, we calculate \mathit{tmf}-based approximations to this family. Our calculations combine an analysis of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for the Tate construction of \mathit{tmf} with trivial C_2-action and Behrens' filtered Mahowald invariant machinery.
