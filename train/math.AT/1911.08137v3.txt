For finite dimensional free C_p-spaces, the calculation of the Bredon cohomology ring as an algebra over the cohomology of S^0 is used to prove the non-existence of certain C_p-maps. These are related to Borsuk-Ulam type theorems, and equivariant maps related to the topological Tverberg conjecture. For certain finite dimensional C_p-spaces which are formed out of representations, it is proved that the cohomology is a free module over the cohomology of a point. All the calculations are done for the cohomology with constant coefficients \mathbb{Z}/p.
