We show that the map \pi_\ast \mathrm{MString}\to \pi_\ast \mathrm{tmf} induced by the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation is surjective. This proves an unpublished claim of Hopkins and Mahowald. We do so by constructing an \mathbf{E}_1-ring B and a map B \to \mathrm{MString} such that the composite B \to \mathrm{MString} \to \mathrm{tmf} is surjective on homotopy. Applications to differential topology, and in particular to Hirzebruch's prize question, are discussed.
