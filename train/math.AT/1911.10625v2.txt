Let X be a simply connected space with finite-dimensional rational homotopy groups. Let p_\infty \colon UE \to \mathrm{Baut}_1(X) be the universal fibration of simply connected spaces with fibre X. We give a DG Lie model for the evaluation map  \omega \colon \mathrm{aut}_1(\mathrm{Baut}_1(X_{\mathbb Q})) \to \mathrm{Baut}_1(X_{\mathbb Q}) expressed in terms of derivations of the relative Sullivan model of p_\infty. We deduce formulas for the rational Gottlieb group and for the evaluation subgroups of the classifying space \mathrm{Baut}_1(X_{\mathbb Q}) as a consequence. We also prove that {\mathbb C} P^n_{\mathbb Q} cannot be realized as \mathrm{Baut}_1(X_{\mathbb Q}) for n \leq 4 and X with finite-dimensional rational homotopy groups.
