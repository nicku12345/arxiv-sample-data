In this work, we study the DGAs that arise from ring spectra through the extension of scalars functor. In other words, the DGAs whose corresponding Eilenberg-Mac Lane ring spectrum is equivalent to H\mathbb{Z} \wedge E for some ring spectrum E. We call these DGAs extension DGAs. We also define and study this notion for E_\infty DGAs.   Topological Hochschild homology (THH) spectrum of an extension DGA splits in a convenient way. We show that formal DGAs with nice homology ring are extension and therefore their THH groups can be obtained from their Hochschild homology groups in many cases of interest. We also provide interesting examples of DGAs that are not extension.   In the second part, we study properties of extension DGAs. We show that in various cases, topological equivalences and quasi-isomorphisms agree for extension DGAs. From this, we obtain that dg Morita equivalences and Morita equivalences also agree in these cases.
