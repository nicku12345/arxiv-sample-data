In 1920s R. L. Moore introduced \emph{upper semicontinuous} and \emph{lower semicontinuous} decompositions in studying decomposition spaces. Upper semicontinuous decompositions were studied very well by himself and later by R.H. Bing in 1950s. In this paper we consider lower semicontinuous decompositions \mathcal D of a topological space X such that the decomposition spaces X/\mathcal D are Alexandroff spaces. If the associated proset (preordered set) of the decomposition space X/\mathcal D is a poset, then the decomposition map \pi:X \to X/\mathcal D is \emph{a continuous map from the topological space X to the poset X/\mathcal D with the associated Alexandroff topology}, which is nowadays called \emph{a poset-stratified space}. As an application, we capture the face poset of a real hyperplane arrangement \mathcal A of \mathbb R^n as the associated poset of the decomposition space \mathbb R^n/\mathcal D(\mathcal A) of the decomposition \mathcal D(\mathcal A) determined by the arrangement \mathcal A. We also show that for any locally small category \mathcal C the set hom_{\mathcal C}(X,Y) of morphisms from X to Y can be considered as a poset-stratified space, and that for any objects S, T (where S plays as a source object and T as a target object) there are a covariant functor \frak {st}^S_*: \mathcal C \to \mathcal Strat and a contravariant functor \frak {st}^*_T \frak {st}^*_T: \mathcal C \to \mathcal Strat from \mathcal C to the category \mathcal Strat of poset-stratified spaces. We also make a remark about Yoneda's Lemmas as to poset-stratified space structures of hom_{\mathcal C}(X,Y).
