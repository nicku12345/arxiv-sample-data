Starting with a \mathbb{C}^*-valued cocycle on the global quotient orbifold X // G, we apply transgression techniques for 2-gerbes, as developed by Lupercio and Uribe, to construct a gerbe on the orbifold loop space \mathcal{L}(X//G). This gives a loop based definition of twisted equivariant Tate K-theory for finite groups that conforms to the definition that Luecke provides for compact, connected Lie groups. We relate our construction to Ganter's work on Moonshine and Huan's quasi-elliptic cohomology.
