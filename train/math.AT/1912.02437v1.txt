Topological complexity was first introduced in 2003 by Michael Farber as a homotopy invariant for a connected topological space X, denoted by TC(X). Although the invariant is defined in terms of elementary homotopy theory using well-known Serre path fibration, not many examples are known to be determined concretely by now. In 2010, Iwase and Sakai showed that the topological complexity of a space is a fibrewise version of a L-S category for a fibrewise space over the space. In this paper, we determine the topological complexity of S^3/Q_8 using a method produced from the fibrewise view point.
