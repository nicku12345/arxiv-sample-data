We show that the vector bundle on the moduli stack M_\mathrm{ell} of elliptic curves associated to the 2-cell complex C\nu is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology sheaf \mathrm{H}^1_\mathrm{dR}(\mathcal{E}/M_\mathrm{ell}) of the universal elliptic curve \mathcal{E}\to M_\mathrm{ell}. We use this to calculate the homotopy groups of the \mathbf{E}_{1}-quotient \mathrm{tmf} /\!\!/ \nu of \mathrm{tmf} by \nu, called the spectrum of "topological quasimodular forms", by relating its Adams-Novikov spectral sequence to the cohomology of the moduli stack of cubic curves with a chosen splitting of the Hodge-de Rham filtration.
