For a Hausdorff space X, we exhibit an unexpected connection between the sectional number of the Fadell-Neuwirth fibration \pi_{2,1}^X:F(X,2)\to X, and the fixed point property (FPP) for self-maps on X. Explicitly, we demonstrate that a space X has the FPP if and only if 2 is the minimal cardinality of open covers \{U_i\} of X such that each U_i admits a continuous local section for \pi_{2,1}^X. This characterization connects a standard problem in fixed point theory to current research trends in topological robotics.
