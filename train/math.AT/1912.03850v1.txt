The Hilali conjecture claims that a simply connected rationally elliptic space X satisfies the inequality \operatorname{dim} (\pi_*(X)\otimes \mathbb Q ) \leqq \operatorname{dim} H_*(X;\mathbb Q ). In this paper we show that for any such space X there exists a positive integer n_0 such that for any n \geqq n_0 the \emph{strict inequality} \operatorname{dim} (\pi_*(X^n)\otimes \mathbb Q ) < \operatorname{dim} H_*(X^n;\mathbb Q ) holds, where X^{n} is the product of n copies of X.
