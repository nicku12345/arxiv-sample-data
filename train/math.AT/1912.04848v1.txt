The Serre spectral system associated with a tower of fibrations represents a generalization of the classical Serre spectral sequence of a fibration. In this work, we present algorithms to compute the Serre spectral system leveraging the effective homology technique, which allows to perform computations involving infinitely generated chain complexes associated with interesting objects in algebraic topology. In order to develop the programs, implemented as a new module for the Computer Algebra system Kenzo, we translated the original construction of the Serre spectral system in a simplicial framework and studied some of its fundamental properties.
