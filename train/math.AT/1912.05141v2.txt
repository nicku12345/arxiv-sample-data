We prove an upper bound of higher topological complexity TC_n(X) using higher \mathcal{D}-topological complexity TC_n^{\mathcal{D}}(X) of a space X. An intermediate invariant \widetilde{TC}_n(X) is used in the proof. We interpret this invariant \widetilde{TC}_n(X) as higher analogue of strongly equivariant topological complexity of the universal cover of \widetilde{X} with the action of the fundamental group of X.
