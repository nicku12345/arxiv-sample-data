We introduce the notion of smooth cell complexes and its subclass consisting of gathered cell complexes within the category of diffeological spaces (cf. Definitions 1 and 3). It is shown that the following hold.   (1) With respect to the D-topology, every smooth cell complex is a topological cell complex (cf. Proposition 2). It is paracompact and Hausdorff if it is countable (cf. Proposition 8).   (2) Every continuous map between gathered cell complexes is continuously homotopic to a smooth map (cf. Theorem 5).   (3) Any topological cell complex is continuously homotopy equivalent to a gathered (hence smooth) cell complex (cf. Theorem 6).   (4) Every D-open cover of a smooth countable cell complex has a subordinate partition of unity by smooth functions (cf. Theorem 9).
