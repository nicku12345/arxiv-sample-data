We compute the RO(C_4) integral homology of a point with complete information as a Green functor, and we show that it is generated, in a slightly generalized sense, by the Euler and orientation classes of the irreducible real C_4-representations. We have devised a computer program that automates these computations for groups G=C_{p^n} and we have used it to verify our results for G=C_4 in a finite range.
