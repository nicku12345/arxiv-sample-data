We introduce a global equivariant refinement of algebraic K-theory; here `global equivariant' refers to simultaneous and compatible actions of all finite groups. Our construction turns a specific kind of categorical input data into a global \Omega-spectrum that keeps track of genuine G-equivariant infinite loop spaces, for all finite groups G. The resulting global algebraic K-theory spectrum is a rigid way of packaging the representation K-theory, or `Swan K-theory' into one highly structured object.
