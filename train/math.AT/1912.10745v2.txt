The Schubert varieties on a flag manifold G/P give rise to a cell decomposition on G/P whose Kronecker duals, known as the Schubert classes on G/P, form an additive base of the integral cohomology of G/P. The Schubert's problem of characteristics asks to express a monomial in the Schubert classes as a linear combination in the Schubert basis.   We present a unified formula expressing the characteristics of a flag manifold G/P as polynomials in the Cartan numbers of the group G. As application we develop a direct approach to our recent works on the Schubert presentation of the cohomology rings of flag manifolds G/P.
