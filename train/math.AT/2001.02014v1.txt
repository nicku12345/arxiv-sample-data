Let R be a (P.I.D) and let T(V),\partial) be a free R-dga. The quasi-isomorphism type of (T(V),\partial) is the set, denoted \{(T(V),\partial)\}, of all free dgas which are quasi-isomorphic to (T(V),\partial). In this paper we investigate to characterize and to compute the set \{(T(V),\partial)\} for a new class of free dgas called perfect (a special kind of a perfect dga is the Adams-Hilton model of simply connected CW-complex such that H_{*}(X,R) is free). We show that if (T(V),\partial) and (T(W),\delta) are two perfect dgas, then (T(W),\delta)\in \{(T(V),\partial)\} if and only if their Whitehead exact sequences are isomorphic. Moreover we show that every dga (T(V),\partial) can be split to give a pair \big((T(V),\widetilde{\partial}),(\pi_{n})_{n\geq 2}\big) consisting with a perfect dga (T(V),\widetilde{\partial}) and a family of extensions (\pi_{n})_{n\geq 2} and we establish that if (T(W),\widetilde{\delta})\in \{(T(V),\widetilde{\partial})\} and if the extensions (\pi_{n})_{n\geq 2} and (\pi'_{n})_{n\geq 2} are isomorphic (in a certain sense), then (T(W),\delta)\in \{(T(V),\partial)\}.
