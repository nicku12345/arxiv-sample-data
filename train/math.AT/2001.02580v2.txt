We investigate when a commutative ring spectrum R satisfies a homotopical version of local Gorenstein duality, extending the notion previously studied by Greenlees. In order to do this, we prove an ascent theorem for local Gorenstein duality along morphisms of k-algebras. Our main examples are of the form R = C^*(X;k), the ring spectrum of cochains on a space X for a field k. In particular, we establish local Gorenstein duality in characteristic p for p-compact groups and p-local finite groups as well as for k = \Q and X a simply connected space which is Gorenstein in the sense of Dwyer, Greenlees, and Iyengar.
