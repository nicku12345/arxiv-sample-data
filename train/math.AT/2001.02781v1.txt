The mod p homology of E-infinity spaces is a classical topic in algebraic topology traditionally approached in terms of Dyer--Lashof operations. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on the subject by providing a detailed investigation of an alternative family of homology operations equivalent to, but distinct from, the Dyer--Lashof operations. Among other things, we will relate these operations to the Dyer--Lashof operations, describe the algebra generated by them, and use them to describe the homology of free E-infinity spaces. We will also investigate the relationship between the operations arising from the additive and multiplicative E-infinity structures on an E-infinity ring space. The operations have especially good properties in this context, allowing for a simple and conceptual formulation of "mixed Adem relations" describing how the operations arising from the two different E-infinity structures interact.
