We compute some R-motivic stable homotopy groups. For s - w \leq 11, we describe the motivic stable homotopy groups \pi_{s,w} of a completion of the R-motivic sphere spectrum. We apply the \rho-Bockstein spectral sequence to obtain R-motivic Ext groups from the C-motivic Ext groups, which are well-understood in a large range. These Ext groups are the input to the R-motivic Adams spectral sequence. We fully analyze the Adams differentials in a range, and we also analyze hidden extensions by \rho, 2, and \eta. As a consequence of our computations, we recover Mahowald invariants of many low-dimensional classical stable homotopy elements.
