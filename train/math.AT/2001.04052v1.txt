In this paper we introduce a simplicial analogue of principal bundles with commutativity structure and their classifying spaces defined for topological groups. Our construction is a variation of the \overline W-construction for simplicial groups. We show that the commutative \overline W-construction is a classifying space for simplicial principal bundles with a commutativity structure and geometric realization relates our constructions to the topological version.
