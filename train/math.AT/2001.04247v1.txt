We discuss the current state of knowledge of stable homotopy groups of spheres. We describe a new computational method that yields a streamlined computation of the first 61 stable homotopy groups, and gives new information about the stable homotopy groups in dimensions 62 through 90. The method relies more heavily on machine computations than previous methods, and is therefore less prone to error. The main mathematical tool is the Adams spectral sequence.
