A simplicial set is said to be non-singular if its non-degenerate simplices are embedded. Let sSet denote the category of simplicial sets. We prove that the full subcategory nsSet whose objects are the non-singular simplicial sets admits a model structure such that nsSet becomes is Quillen equivalent to sSet equipped with the standard model structure due to Quillen. The model structure on nsSet is right-induced from sSet and it makes nsSet a proper cofibrantly generated model category. Together with Thomason's model structure on small categories (1980) and Raptis' model structure on posets (2010) these form a square-shaped diagram of Quillen equivalent model categories in which the subsquare of right adjoints commutes.
