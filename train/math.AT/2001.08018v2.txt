The E_2-term of the Adams spectral sequence for \mathbf{Y} may be described in terms of its cohomology E^\ast \mathbf{Y}, together with the action of the primary operations E^\ast \mathbf{E} on it, for ring spectra such as \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{H}\mathbb{F}_p. We show how the higher terms of the spectral sequence can be similarly described in terms of the higher order truncated \mathbf{E}-mapping algebra for \mathbf{Y} \; - \; that is truncations of the function spectra \operatorname{Fun}(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{M}) for various \mathbf{E}-modules \mathbf{M}, equipped with the action of \operatorname{Fun}(\mathbf{M}, \mathbf{M}') on them.
