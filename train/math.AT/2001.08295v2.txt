We study certain formal group laws equipped with an action of the cyclic group of order a power of 2. We construct C_{2^n}-equivariant Real oriented models of Lubin-Tate spectra E_h at heights h=2^{n-1}m and give explicit formulas of the C_{2^n}-action on their coefficient rings. Our construction utilizes equivariant formal group laws associated with the norms of the Real bordism theory MU_{\mathbb{R}}, and our work examines the height of the formal group laws of the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norms of MU_{\mathbb{R}}.
