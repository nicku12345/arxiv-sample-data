The close relationship between the scheme of level structures on the universal deformation of a formal group and the Morava E-cohomology of finite abelian groups has played an important role in the study of power operations for Morava E-theory. The goal of this paper is to explore the relationship between level structures on the p-divisible group given by the trivial extension of the universal deformation by a constant p-divisible group and the Morava E-cohomology of the iterated free loop space of the classifying space of a finite abelian group.
