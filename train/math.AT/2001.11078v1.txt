Let G be a finite group and E be an H_\infty-ring G-spectrum. For any G-space X and positive integer m, we give an explicit description of the smallest Mackey ideal \underline{J} in \underline{E}^0(X\times B\Sigma_m) for which the reduced mth power operation \underline{E}^0(X) \to \underline{E}^0(X \times B\Sigma_m )/\underline{J} is a map of Green functors. We obtain this result as a special case of a general theorem that we establish in the context of G\times\Sigma_m-Green functors. This theorem also specializes to characterize the appropriate ideal \underline{J} when E is an ultra-commutative global ring spectrum. We give example computations for the sphere spectrum, complex K-theory, and Morava E-theory.
