A complexity-one space is a compact symplectic manifold (M, \omega) endowed with an effective Hamiltonian action of a torus T of dimension \frac{1}{2}\dim(M)-1. In this note we prove that for a certain class of complexity-one spaces the Poincar\'e dual of the Chern class c_{n-1} can be represented by a collection of \frac{n}{2}\chi(M) symplectic embedded 2-spheres, where \chi(M) is the Euler characteristic of M and \dim(M)=2n. We call such a collection a toric one-skeleton. The classification of complexity-one spaces is an important subject in symplectic geometry. A nice subcategory of those spaces are the ones which are monotone. The existence of a toric one-skeleton is a useful tool to understand six-dimensional monotone complexity-one spaces. In particular, we will show that the existence of a toric one-skeleton for such a space implies that the second Betti number of M is at most seven. This is a simple application of results by Sabatini-Sepe and Lindsay-Panov.
