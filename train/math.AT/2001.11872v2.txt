Let p be prime. We prove that, for n odd, the p-torsion part of \pi_q(S^{n}) has cardinality at most p^{2^{\frac{1}{p-1}(q-n+3-2p)}}, and hence has rank at most 2^{\frac{1}{p-1}(q-n+3-2p)}. For p=2 these results also hold for n even. The best bounds proven in the existing literature are p^{2^{q-n+1}} and 2^{q-n+1} respectively, both due to Hans-Werner Henn. The main point of our result is therefore that the bound grows more slowly for larger primes. As a corollary of work of Henn, we obtain a similar result for the homotopy groups of a broader class of spaces.
