The aim of this short paper is to establish a spectral algebra analog of the Bousfield-Kan "fibration lemma" under appropriate conditions. We work in the context of algebraic structures that can be described as algebras over an operad \mathcal{O} in symmetric spectra. Our main result is that completion with respect to topological Quillen homology (or TQ-completion, for short) preserves homotopy fibration sequences provided that the base and total \mathcal{O}-algebras are connected. Our argument essentially boils down to proving that the natural map from the homotopy fiber to its TQ-completion tower is a pro-\pi_* isomorphism. More generally, we also show that similar results remain true if we replace "homotopy fibration sequence" with "homotopy pullback square."
