We develop a spectral sequence for the homotopy groups of Loday constructions with respect to twisted products in the case where the group involved is a constant simplicial group. We show that for commutative Hopf algebra spectra Loday constructions are stable, generalizing a result by Berest, Ramadoss and Yeung. We prove that several truncated polynomial rings are not multiplicatively stable by investigating their torus homology.
