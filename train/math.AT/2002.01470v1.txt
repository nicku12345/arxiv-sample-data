We exploit the Galois symmetries of the little disks operads to show that many differentials in the Goodwillie-Weiss spectral sequences approximating the homology and homotopy of knot spaces vanish at a prime p. Combined with recent results on the relationship between embedding calculus and finite-type theory, we deduce that the (n+1)-st Goodwillie-Weiss approximation is a p-local universal Vassiliev invariant of degree \leq n for every n \leq p + 1.
